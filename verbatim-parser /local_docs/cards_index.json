We had, it is stated, developed elements of a critical theory of society, but we were not prepared to draw the practical consequences from this theory. We neither designed programmes for action nor did we support the actions of those who felt themselves inspired by critical theory. I shall sidestep the question whether this demand can be made at all upon theoretical thinkers who always remain to a certain degree sensitive and by no means unshakable instruments. The task assigned such individuals within a society characterized by the division of labour might indeed by questionable; they themselves might well be deformed by it. But they have also been formed by it. And there is no way in which they can repeal that which they have become merely through an act of their own will. I should not want to deny the impulse of subjective weakness inherent in the confinement to theory. The objection raised against us can be stated approximately in these words; a person who is in the present hour doubts the possibility of radical change in society and who for that reason neither takes part in nor recommends spectacular, violent action is guilty of resignation. He does not consider the vision of change which he once held capable of realization; indeed, he actually had no true desire to see it realized in the first place. In leaving conditions as they are, he offers his tacit approval of them. Distance from praxis is disreputable in the eyes of everyone. Anyone who does not take immediate action and who is not willing to get his hands dirty is the subject of suspicion; it is felt that his antipathy toward such action was not legitimate, and further that his view has even been distorted by the privileges he enjoys. Distrust of those who distrust praxis extends from those on the opposite side, who repeat the old slogan, \u2018We\u2019ve had enough of talking\u2019 all the way to the objective spirit of advertising, which propagates the picture \u2013 it\u2019s called Leitbild or \u2018image as motif\u2019 \u2013 of the actively involved human being, no matter whether his activity lies in the realm of economics or athletics. One should take part. Whoever restricts himself to thinking but does not get involved is weak, cowardly and virtually a traitor. This hostile clich\u00e9 on the intellectual is to be encountered with deep roots within that branch of the opposition that is in turn reviled as intellectual without any awareness thereof on their part. Thinking activists answer; among the things to be changed is that very separation of theory and praxis. Praxis is essential if we are ever to be liberated from the domination of practical people and practical ideals. The trouble with this view is that it results in the prohibition of thinking. Very little is needed to turn the resistance against repression repressively against those who \u2013 little as they might wish to glorify their state of being \u2013 do not desert the standpoint that they have come to occupy. The often-evoked unity of theory and praxis has a tendency to give way to the predominance of praxis. Numerous views define theory itself as a form of repression \u2013 as though praxis did not stand in a far more direct relationship to repression. For Marx, the dogma of this unity was animated by the immanent possibility of action which even then was not to be realized. Today it is rather the opposite situation that prevails. One clings to action because of the impossibility of action. But Marx himself reveals a concealed wound in this regard. He no doubt delivered the eleventh thesis on Feuerbach in such an authoritarian fashion because he was not at all sure of it himself. In his youth he had demanded the \u2018ruthless criticism of everything that exists\u2019. Now he mocked criticism. But his famous joke about the Young Hegelians, his coinage \u201ccritical criticism\u2019, was a dud and went up in smoke as nothing but a tautology. The forced precedence of praxis brought the criticism which Marx himself practiced to an irrational halt. In Russia and in the orthodoxy of other countries, the malicious mockery of critical criticism became the instrument that permitted the status quo to establish itself in such horrifying fashion. The only meaning that praxis retained was this: increased production of the means of production. The only criticism still tolerated was that people were not working hard enough. This demonstrates how easily the subordination of theory to praxis results in the support of renewed repression.  Repressive intolerance toward a thought not immediately accompanied by instructions for action is founded in fear. Unmanipulated thought and the position that allows nothing to be deduced from this thought must be feared because that which cannot be admitted is perfectly clear: this thought is right. An aged bourgeois mechanism with which the men of the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century were very familiar displays itself anew but unchanged: suffering caused by a negative condition \u2013 in this case by obstructed reality \u2013 turns into anger toward the person who expresses it. Thought, enlightenment conscious of itself, threatens to disenchant pseudo-reality within which, according to Habermas\u2019 formulation, activism moves. This activism is tolerated only because it is viewed as pseudo-activity. Pseudo-activity is allied with pseudo-reality in the design of a subjective position; an activity that overplays itself and fires itself up for the sake of its own publicity without admitting to what degree it serves as a substitute for satisfaction, thus elevating itself to an end in itself. All those behind bars are despondent in their desire to be released. In such situations one no longer thinks or thinks only in fictive postulates. Within absolutized praxis, only reaction is possible and for this reason the reaction is false. Only thinking could offer an escape, and then only that thinking , the results of which are not prescribed \u2013 as is so frequently the case in those discussions in which it is predetermined who is right and which therefore do not advance the cause \u2013 but rather degenerate without fail into tactics. When the doors are barricaded, it is doubly important that thought not be interrupted. It is rather the task of thought to analyse the reasons behind this situation and to draw the consequences from these reasons. It is the responsibility of thought not to accept the situation as finite. If there is any chance of changing the situation, it is only through undiminished insight. The leap into praxis will not cure thought from resignation as long as it is paid for with the secret knowledge that this course is simply not the right one. Generally speaking, pseudo-activity is the attempt to preserve enclaves of immediacy in the midst of a thoroughly mediated and obdurate society. This process is rationalized through the acceptance of any small change as one step on the long way toward total change. The unfortunate model for pseudo-activity is the \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 syndrome \u2013 activities that do that which has long been done better through the means of industrial production and which arouse in unfree individuals, hampered in their spontaneity, the confident feeling that they are of central concern. The nonsense of the \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 approach to the production of material goods and in the making of many repairs is equally obvious. However, it is not total. In view of the reduction of so-called services \u2013 sometimes superfluous in terms of technical standards \u2013 measures taken by a private person fulfill a semi-rational purpose. In politics, however, the \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 attitude is not of quite the same character. The society that confronts human beings in such an impenetrable manner is these humans themselves. Confidence in the limited action of small groups is reminiscent of the spontaneity which atrophies beneath the encrusted totality and without which this totality cannot be transformed into something different. The administered world has a tendency to strangle all spontaneity or at least to channel it into pseudo-activity. This, however, is not achieved so totally without difficulty as the agents of the administered world would like to imagine. Nonetheless, spontaneity is not to be absolutized \u2013 just as little as it is to be separated from the objective situation and idolized in the same manner as is the administered world itself. Otherwise the axe will break down the next door in the house \u2013 a process which never spares the carpenter \u2013 and the riot squad will appear on the spot. Political acts of violence can also sink to the level of pseudo-activity, resulting in mere theatre. It is hardly a wonder that the ideal of direct action and propaganda glorifying the deed have been resurrected, upon the heels of the willing integration of formerly progressive organizations that, in all lands of the earth, manifest the character of that against which they were once directed. This process, however, has not weakened the criticism of anarchism, the return of which is the return of the ghost. The impatience toward theory manifested in this return does nothing to advance thought beyond itself. Theory falls behind the thought which it forgets. For the individual, life is made easier through capitulation to the collective with which he identifies. He is spared the cognition of his impotence; within the circle of their own company, the few become many. It is this act \u2013 not unconfused thinking \u2013 which is resignation. No transparent relation prevails between the interests of the ego and the collective to which it assigns itself. The ego must abrogate itself, if it is to share in the predestination of the collective. Explicitly a remnant of the Kantian categorical imperative manifests itself: your signature is required. The feeling of a new security is purchased with the sacrifice of autonomous thinking. The consolation that thought within the context of collective action is an improvement proves deceptive: thinking, employed only as the instrument of action, is blunted in the same manner as all instrumental reason. At the present moment, no higher form of society is concretely visible: for that reason, anything that seems in easy reach is regressive. According to Freud, however, whoever regresses has not achieved the goal of his drives. Objectively viewed, reformation is renunciation, even if it considers itself the opposite and innocently propagates the pleasure principle.  In contrast, the uncompromisingly critical thinker, who neither superscribes his conscience nor permits himself to be terrorized into action, is in truth the one who does not give up. Furthermore, thinking is not the spiritual reproduction of that which exists. As long as thinking is not interrupted, it has a firm grasp upon possibility. Its insatiable quality, the resistance against petty satiety, rejects the foolish wisdom of resignation. The Utopian impulse in thinking is all the stronger, the less it objectifies itself as Utopia \u2013 a further form of regression \u2013 whereby it sabotages its own realization. Open thinking points beyond itself. For its part, such thinking takes a position as a figuation of praxis which is more closely related to a praxis truly involved in change than in a position of mere obedience for the sake of praxis. Beyond all specialized and particular content, thinking is actually and above all the force of resistance, alienated from resistance only with great effort. This emphatic concept of thinking is by no means secure; no security is granted it by existing conditions nor by the ends yet to be attained nor by any type of organized force. Whatever was once thought, however, can be suppressed; it can be forgotten and can even vanish. But it cannot be denied that something of it survives. For thinking has the momentum of the general. What has been cogently thought must be thought in some other place and by other people. This confidence accompanies even the loneliest and most impotent thought. Whoever thinks is without anger in all criticism: 1 thinking sublimates anger. Because the thinking person does not have to inflict anger upon himself, he furthermore has no desire to inflict it upon others. The happiness visible to the eye of a thinker is the happiness of mankind. The universal tendency toward suppression goes against thought as such. Such thought is happiness, even where unhappiness prevails; thought achieves happiness in the expression of unhappiness. Whoever refuses to permit this thought to be taken from him has not resigned.", "", ""], "id": "09e9cdd9b8b2a9a233de5b5b0331fc317ee2e0dcbab6d483f11d07857737e334", "highlighted_text": "a person who neither takes part in nor recommends spectacular action and is not willing to get his hands dirty is the subject of suspicion distorted by privilege s the opposite side repeat this view results in the prohibition of thinking intolerance toward a thought not immediately accompanied by instructions for action is founded in fear . activism is tolerated only because it is pseudo-activity allied with pseudo-reality in the design of a subjective position that fires itself up for the sake of its own publicity When the doors are barricaded It is rather the task of thought to analyse the reasons behind this situation pseudo-activity rationalized through the acceptance of any small change as one step on the long way toward total change . the categorical imperative manifests itself: your signature is required . the uncompromisingly critical thinker, who neither superscribes conscience nor permits to be terrorized into action , is the one who does not give up Utopian impulse in thinking is all the stronger, the less it objectifies itself as Utopia \u2013 a further form of regression", "highlights": [[4, 1120, 1132], [4, 1232, 1280], [4, 1290, 1296], [4, 1663, 1666], [4, 1671, 1692], [4, 1693, 1696], [4, 1697, 1736], [4, 1847, 1859], [4, 1864, 1873], [4, 1873, 1874], [4, 1946, 1963], [4, 1969, 1975], [4, 2824, 2833], [4, 2845, 2883], [4, 4632, 4734], [4, 4734, 4735], [4, 5359, 5399], [4, 5410, 5425], [4, 5446, 5511], [4, 5525, 5529], [4, 5551, 5600], [4, 6261, 6290], [4, 6348, 6353], [4, 6354, 6360], [4, 6361, 6383], [4, 6384, 6391], [4, 6392, 6425], [4, 6819, 6834], [4, 6960, 7063], [4, 7063, 7064], [4, 9846, 9849], [4, 9858, 9925], [4, 9925, 9926], [4, 10609, 10672], [4, 10677, 10699], [4, 10708, 10736], [4, 10736, 10737], [4, 10738, 10740], [4, 10750, 10753], [4, 10754, 10778], [4, 11045, 11165]], "underlines": [[4, 1044, 1119], [4, 1120, 1132], [4, 1133, 1231], [4, 1232, 1280], [4, 1280, 1289], [4, 1290, 1296], [4, 1297, 1321], [4, 1559, 1662], [4, 1663, 1666], [4, 1667, 1670], [4, 1671, 1692], [4, 1693, 1696], [4, 1697, 1736], [4, 1736, 1753], [4, 1754, 1757], [4, 1758, 1823], [4, 1824, 1827], [4, 1828, 1846], [4, 1847, 1859], [4, 1860, 1863], [4, 1864, 1873], [4, 1873, 1874], [4, 1875, 1945], [4, 1946, 1963], [4, 1963, 1968], [4, 1969, 1975], [4, 1976, 1993], [4, 1993, 2020], [4, 2807, 2823], [4, 2824, 2833], [4, 2834, 2844], [4, 2845, 2883], [4, 2883, 3101], [4, 4618, 4631], [4, 4632, 4734], [4, 4734, 4735], [4, 4736, 4898], [4, 5354, 5358], [4, 5359, 5399], [4, 5400, 5409], [4, 5410, 5425], [4, 5425, 5445], [4, 5446, 5511], [4, 5511, 5524], [4, 5525, 5529], [4, 5530, 5550], [4, 5551, 5600], [4, 5601, 5676], [4, 5676, 5682], [4, 5683, 5719], [4, 5964, 5999], [4, 6261, 6290], [4, 6290, 6347], [4, 6348, 6353], [4, 6354, 6360], [4, 6361, 6383], [4, 6384, 6391], [4, 6392, 6425], [4, 6426, 6549], [4, 6550, 6639], [4, 6639, 6818], [4, 6819, 6834], [4, 6835, 6948], [4, 6949, 6956], [4, 6957, 6959], [4, 6960, 7063], [4, 7063, 7064], [4, 9822, 9845], [4, 9846, 9849], [4, 9850, 9857], [4, 9858, 9925], [4, 9925, 9926], [4, 9927, 10012], [4, 10596, 10608], [4, 10609, 10672], [4, 10673, 10676], [4, 10677, 10699], [4, 10700, 10707], [4, 10708, 10736], [4, 10736, 10737], [4, 10738, 10740], [4, 10741, 10749], [4, 10750, 10753], [4, 10754, 10778], [4, 10778, 10959], [4, 10960, 10996], [4, 10996, 10997], [4, 10998, 11005], [4, 11006, 11027], [4, 11028, 11039], [4, 11039, 11040], [4, 11045, 11165], [4, 12216, 12279], [4, 12280, 12287], [4, 12287, 12288], [4, 12289, 12291], [4, 12292, 12303], [4, 12304, 12343], [4, 12343, 12410], [4, 12411, 12418], [4, 12418, 12551], [4, 12552, 12611], [4, 12611, 12612], [4, 12613, 12663], [4, 12664, 12668], [4, 12669, 12672], [4, 12673, 12689], [4, 12689, 12690]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "Schlag_Link_DA_Neg.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1972-01-01"}, {"tag": "Adorno Link DA 2NR", "cite": "Academic deliberation doesn\u2019t do anything  about material violence like <<insert impacts>> because we are high schoolers confined to one debate round without our hands on the levers of power\u2014that\u2019s Adorno\u2014all they do is parade ethical crises in exchange for a ballot, ushering in interpassive deliberation and complacency that turn case.

If one observes the state of our world today, this is the pattern that underlies our deadly and destructive social behavior. This mindset was no better articulated than when George W. Bush declared \u201cyou\u2019re either with us, or against us.\u201d Through years of careful conditioning, we learn to think of ourselves in terms of agencies and/or abstractions external to our independent being. Or, to express the point more clearly, we have learned to internalize these external forces; to conform our thinking and behavior to the purposes and interests of such entities. We adorn ourselves with flags, mouth shibboleths, and decorate our cars with bumper-stickers, in order to communicate to others our sense of \u201cwho we are.\u201d In such ways does our being become indistinguishable from our chosen collective. In this way are institutions born. We discover a particular form of organization through which we are able to cooperate with others for our mutual benefit. Over time, the advantages derived from this system have a sufficient consistency to lead us to the conclusion that our well-being is dependent upon it. Those who manage the organization find it in their self-interests to propagate this belief so that we will become dependent upon its permanency. Like a sculptor working with clay, institutions take over the direction of our minds, twisting, squeezing, and pounding upon them until we have embraced a mindset conducive to their interests. Once this has been accomplished, we find it easy to subvert our will and sense of purpose to the collective. The organization ceases being a mere tool of mutual convenience, and becomes an end in itself. Our lives become \u201cinstitutionalized,\u201d and we regard it as fanciful to imagine ourselves living in any other way than as constituent parts of a machine that transcends our individual sense. Once we identify ourselves with the state, that collective entity does more than represent who we are; it is who we are. To the politicized mind, the idea that \u201cwe are the government\u201d has real meaning, not in the sense of being able to control such an agency, but in the psychological sense. The successes and failures of the state become the subject\u2019s successes and failures; insults or other attacks upon their abstract sense of being \u2013 such as the burning of \u201ctheir\u201d flag \u2013 become assaults upon their very personhood. Shortcomings on the part of the state become our failures of character. This is why so many Americans who have belatedly come to criticize the war against Iraq are inclined to treat it as only a \u201cmistake\u201d or the product of \u201cmismanagement,\u201d not as a moral wrong. Our egos can more easily admit to the making of a mistake than to moral transgressions. Such an attitude also helps to explain why, as Milton Mayer wrote in his revealing post-World War II book, They Thought They Were Free, most Germans were unable to admit that the Nazi regime had been tyrannical. It is this dynamic that makes it easy for political officials to generate wars, a process that reinforces the sense of identity and attachment people have for \u201ctheir\u201d state. It also helps to explain why most Americans \u2013 though tiring of the war against Iraq \u2013 refuse to condemn government leaders for the lies, forgeries, and deceit employed to get the war started: to acknowledge the dishonesty of the system through which they identify themselves is to admit to the dishonest base of their being. The truthfulness of the state\u2019s rationale for war is irrelevant to most of its subjects. It is sufficient that they believe the abstraction with which their lives are intertwined will be benefited in some way by war. Against whom and upon what claim does not matter \u2013 except as a factor in assessing the likelihood of success. That most Americans have pipped nary a squeak of protest over Bush administration plans to attack Iran \u2013 with nuclear weapons if deemed useful to its ends \u2013 reflects the point I am making. Bush could undertake a full-fledged war against Lapland, and most Americans would trot out their flags and bumper-stickers of approval. The \u201crightness\u201d or \u201cwrongness\u201d of any form of collective behavior becomes interpreted by the standard of whose actions are being considered. During World War II, for example, Japanese kamikaze pilots were regarded as crazed fanatics for crashing their planes into American battleships. At the same time, American war movies (see, e.g., Flying Tigers) extolled the heroism of American pilots who did the same thing. One sees this same double-standard in responding to \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d \u201cDo you think a conspiracy was behind the 9/11 attacks?\u201d It certainly seems so to me, unless one is prepared to treat the disappearance of the World Trade Center buildings as the consequence of a couple pilots having bad navigational experiences! The question that should be asked is: whose conspiracy was it? To those whose identities coincide with the state, such a question is easily answered: others conspire, we do not. It is not the symbiotic relationship between war and the expansion of state power, nor the realization of corporate benefits that could not be obtained in a free market, that mobilize the machinery of war. Without most of us standing behind \u201cour\u201d system, and cheering on \u201cour\u201d troops, and defending \u201cour\u201d leaders, none of this would be possible. What would be your likely response if your neighbor prevailed upon you to join him in a violent attack upon a local convenience store, on the grounds that it hired \u201cillegal aliens?\u201d Your sense of identity would not be implicated in his efforts, and you would likely dismiss him as a lunatic. Only when our ego-identities become wrapped up with some institutional abstraction \u2013 such as the state \u2013 can we be persuaded to invest our lives and the lives of our children in the collective madness of state action. We do not have such attitudes toward organizations with which we have more transitory relationships. If we find an accounting error in our bank statement, we would not find satisfaction in the proposition \u201cthe First National Bank, right or wrong.\u201d Neither would we be inclined to wear a T-shirt that read \u201cDisneyland: love it or leave it.\u201d One of the many adverse consequences of identifying with and attaching ourselves to collective abstractions is our loss of control over not only the meaning and direction in our lives, but of the manner in which we can be efficacious in our efforts to pursue the purposes that have become central to us. We become dependent upon the performance of \u201cour\u201d group; \u201cour\u201d reputation rises or falls on the basis of what institutional leaders do or fail to do. If \u201cour\u201d nation-state loses respect in the world \u2013 such as by the use of torture or killing innocent people - we consider ourselves no longer respectable, and scurry to find plausible excuses to redeem our egos. When these expectations are not met, we go in search of new leaders or organizational reforms we believe will restore our sense of purpose and pride that we have allowed abstract entities to personify for us. As the costs and failures of the state become increasingly evident, there is a growing tendency to blame this system. But to do so is to continue playing the same game into which we have allowed ourselves to become conditioned. One of the practices employed by the state to get us to mobilize our \u201cdark side\u201d energies in opposition to the endless recycling of enemies it has chosen for us, is that of psychological projection. Whether we care to acknowledge it or not \u2013 and most of us do not \u2013 each of us has an unconscious capacity for attitudes or conduct that our conscious minds reject. We fear that, sufficiently provoked, we might engage in violence \u2013 even deadly \u2013 against others; or that inducements might cause us to become dishonest. We might harbor racist or other bigoted sentiments, or consider ourselves lazy or irresponsible. Though we are unlikely to act upon such inner fears, their presence within us can generate discomforting self-directed feelings of guilt, anger, or unworthiness that we would like to eliminate. The most common way in which humanity has tried to bring about such an exorcism is by subconsciously projecting these traits onto others (i.e., \u201cscapegoats\u201d) and punishing them for what are really our own shortcomings. The state has trained us to behave this way, in order that we may be counted upon to invest our lives, resources, and other energies in pursuit of the enemy du jour. It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that most of us resort to the same practice in our criticism of political systems. After years of mouthing the high-school civics class mantra about the necessity for government \u2013 and the bigger the government the better \u2013 we begin to experience the unexpected consequences of politicization. Tax burdens continue to escalate; or the state takes our home to make way for a proposed shopping center; or ever-more details of our lives are micromanaged by ever-burgeoning state bureaucracies. Having grown weary of the costs \u2013 including the loss of control over our lives \u2013 we blame the state for what has befallen us. We condemn the Bush administration for the parade of lies that precipitated the war against Iraq, rather than indicting ourselves for ever believing anything the state tells us. We fault the politicians for the skyrocketing costs of governmental programs, conveniently ignoring our insistence upon this or that benefit whose costs we would prefer having others pay. The statists have helped us accept a world view that conflates our incompetence to manage our own lives with their omniscience to manage the lives of billions of people \u2013 along with the planet upon which we live! \u2013 and we are now experiencing the costs generated by our own gullibility. We have acted like country bumpkins at the state fair with the egg money who, having been fleeced by a bunch of carnival sharpies, look everywhere for someone to blame other than ourselves. We have been euchred out of our very lives because of our eagerness to believe that benefits can be enjoyed without incurring costs; that the freedom to control one\u2019s life can be separated from the responsibilities for one\u2019s actions; and that two plus two does not have to add up to four if a sizeable public opinion can be amassed against the proposition. By identifying ourselves with any abstraction (such as the state) we give up the integrated life, the sense of wholeness that can be found only within each of us. While the state has manipulated, cajoled, and threatened us to identify ourselves with it, the responsibility for our acceding to its pressures lies within each of us. The statists have \u2013 as was their vicious purpose \u2013 simply taken over the territory we have abandoned. Our politico-centric pain and suffering has been brought about by our having allowed external forces to move in and occupy the vacuum we created at the center of our being. The only way out of our dilemma involves a retracing of the route that brought us to where we are. We require nothing so much right now as the development of a sense of \u201cwho we are\u201d that transcends our institutionalized identities, and returns us \u2013 without division and conflict \u2013 to a centered, self-directed integrity in our lives."], "id": "d31386f4fc8a7d16f6e30116576fca66b3c3e513bdaf4bc274a9895bb650b438", "highlighted_text": "we think of ourselves in terms of agencies external to our being institutions take over our minds Once we identify ourselves with the state it is who we are this makes it easy to generate wars Only when our identities become wrapped up with the state \u2013 can we be persuaded to invest our lives in collective madness One of the consequences is our loss of meaning suffering has been brought having allowed external forces to occupy our being", "highlights": [[7, 594, 596], [7, 606, 645], [7, 666, 681], [7, 694, 699], [7, 1603, 1625], [7, 1643, 1652], [7, 2154, 2195], [7, 2257, 2273], [7, 3243, 3247], [7, 3261, 3274], [7, 3299, 3315], [7, 5941, 5954], [7, 5959, 5992], [7, 6034, 6068], [7, 6069, 6075], [7, 6076, 6079], [7, 6080, 6085], [7, 6116, 6118], [7, 6123, 6133], [7, 6134, 6141], [7, 6499, 6509], [7, 6523, 6535], [7, 6607, 6621], [7, 6648, 6655], [7, 11107, 11133], [7, 11147, 11153], [7, 11154, 11180], [7, 11193, 11199], [7, 11239, 11248]], "underlines": [[7, 0, 81], [7, 117, 126], [7, 189, 315], [7, 594, 596], [7, 597, 605], [7, 606, 645], [7, 666, 681], [7, 682, 693], [7, 694, 699], [7, 699, 700], [7, 740, 758], [7, 759, 793], [7, 794, 796], [7, 797, 817], [7, 818, 877], [7, 1282, 1421], [7, 1603, 1625], [7, 1626, 1642], [7, 1643, 1652], [7, 1652, 1759], [7, 1965, 2153], [7, 2154, 2195], [7, 2257, 2273], [7, 3237, 3242], [7, 3243, 3247], [7, 3248, 3260], [7, 3261, 3274], [7, 3275, 3280], [7, 3280, 3288], [7, 3289, 3298], [7, 3299, 3315], [7, 3315, 3409], [7, 3409, 3410], [7, 5941, 5954], [7, 5955, 5959], [7, 5959, 5992], [7, 5993, 6033], [7, 6034, 6068], [7, 6069, 6075], [7, 6076, 6079], [7, 6080, 6085], [7, 6116, 6118], [7, 6119, 6122], [7, 6123, 6133], [7, 6134, 6141], [7, 6142, 6157], [7, 6499, 6509], [7, 6510, 6522], [7, 6523, 6535], [7, 6536, 6606], [7, 6607, 6621], [7, 6622, 6634], [7, 6644, 6647], [7, 6648, 6655], [7, 6670, 6687], [7, 10097, 10115], [7, 10429, 10519], [7, 11077, 11106], [7, 11107, 11133], [7, 11134, 11146], [7, 11147, 11153], [7, 11154, 11180], [7, 11181, 11192], [7, 11193, 11199], [7, 11200, 11238], [7, 11239, 11248], [7, 11349, 11496], [7, 11531, 11583]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Schlag_Link_DA_Neg.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local"}, {"tag": "Error Replication Link DA", "cite": "Baudrillard 94", "body": [" (Jean, The Illusion of the End, p. 66-71)", "\t", "We have long denounced the capitalistic, economic exploitation of the poverty of the 'other half of the world' [['autre monde]. We must today denounce the moral and sentimental exploitation of that poverty - charity cannibalism being worse than oppressive violence. The extraction and humanitarian reprocessing of a destitution which has become the equivalent of oil deposits and gold mines. The extortion of the spectacle of poverty and, at the same time, of our charitable condescension: a worldwide appreciated surplus of fine sentiments and bad conscience. We should, in fact, see this not as the extraction of raw materials, but as a waste-reprocessing enterprise. Their destitution and our bad conscience are, in effect, all part of the waste-products of history- the main thing is to recycle them to produce a new energy source. We have here an escalation in the psychological balance of terror. World capitalist oppression is now merely the vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form of moral predation. One might almost say, contrary to the Marxist analysis, that material exploitation is only there to extract that spiritual raw material that is the misery of peoples, which serves as psychological nourishment for the rich countries and media nourishment for our daily lives. The 'Fourth World' (we are no longer dealing with a 'developing' Third World) is once again beleaguered, this time as a catastrophe-bearing stratum. The West is whitewashed in the reprocessing of the rest of the world as waste and residue. And the white world repents and seeks absolution - it, too, the waste-product of its own history. The South is a natural producer of raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe. The North, for its part, specializes in the reprocessing of raw materials and hence also in the reprocessing of catastrophe. Bloodsucking protection, humanitarian interference, Medecins sans frontieres, international solidarity, etc. The last phase of colonialism: the New Sentimental Order is merely the latest form of the New World Order. Other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground. Thus, the humanitarian offensive aimed at the Kurds - a show of repentance on the part of the Western powers after allowing Saddam Hussein to crush them - is in reality merely the second phase of the war, a phase in which charitable intervention finishes off the work of extermination. We are the consumers of the ever delightful spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own efforts to alleviate it (which, in fact, merely function to secure the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market); there, at least, in the order of moral profits, the Marxist analysis is wholly applicable: we see to it that extreme poverty is reproduced as a symbolic deposit, as a fuel essential to the moral and sentimental equilibrium of the West. In our defence, it might be said that this extreme poverty was largely of our own making and it is therefore normal that we should profit by it.  There can be no finer proof that the distress of the rest of the world is at the root of Western power and that the spectacle of that distress is its crowning glory than the inauguration, on the roof of the Arche de la Defense, with a sumptuous buffet laid on by the Fondation des Droits de l'homme, of an exhibition of the finest photos of world poverty. Should we be surprised that spaces are set aside in the Arche d' Alliance. for universal suffering hallowed by caviar and champagne? Just as the economic crisis of the West will not be complete so long as it can still exploit the resources of the rest of the world, so the symbolic crisis will be complete only when it is no longer able to feed on the other half's human and natural catastrophes (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the Kurds, Bangladesh, etc.). We need this drug, which serves us as an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen. And the poor countries are the best suppliers - as, indeed, they are of other drugs. We provide them, through our media, with the means to exploit this paradoxical resource, just as we give them the means to exhaust their natural resources with our technologies. Our whole culture lives off this catastrophic cannibalism, relayed in cynical mode by the news media, and carried forward in moral mode by our humanitarian aid, which is a way of encouraging it and ensuring its continuity, just as economic aid is a strategy for perpetuating under-development. Up to now, the financial sacrifice has been compensated a hundredfold by the moral gain. But when the catastrophe market itself reaches crisis point, in accordance with the implacable logic of the market, when distress becomes scarce or the marginal returns on it fall from overexploitation, when we run out of disasters from elsewhere or when they can no longer be traded like coffee or other commodities, the West will be forced to produce its own catastrophe for itself, in order to meet its need for spectacle and that voracious appetite for symbols which characterizes it even more than its voracious appetite for food. It will reach the point where it devours itself. When we have finished sucking out the destiny of others, we shall have to invent one for ourselves. The Great Crash, the symbolic crash, will come in the end from us Westerners, but only when we are no longer able to feed on the hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other half of the world. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly. The Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really going flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in providing symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to be overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other most of the time. The 'disaster show' goes on without any let-up and our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic debt. The misery with which they generously overwhelm us is something we shall never be able to repay. The sacrifices we offer in return are laughable (a tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the roads, the odd financial sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal logic, these work out as much greater gains for us, whereas our kindnesses have merely added to the natural catastrophes another one immeasurably worse: the demographic catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we deplore each day in pictures. In short, there is such distortion between North and South, to the symbolic advantage of the South (a hundred thousand Iraqi dead against casualties numbered in tens on our side: in every case we are the losers), that one day everything will break down. One day, the West will break down if we are not soon washed clean of this shame, if an international congress of the poor countries does not very quickly decide to share out this symbolic privilege of misery and catastrophe. It is of course normal, since we refuse to allow the spread of nuclear weapons, that they should refuse to allow the spread of the catastrophe weapon. But it is not right that they should exert that monopoly indefinitely.  In any case, the under-developed are only so by comparison with the Western system and its presumed success. In the light of its assumed failure, they are not under-developed at all. They are only so in terms of a dominant evolutionism which has always been the worst of colonial ideologies. The argument here is that there is a line of objective progress and everyone is supposed to pass through its various stages (we find the same eyewash with regard to the evolution of species and in that evolutionism which unilaterally sanctions the superiority of the human race). In the light of current upheavals, which put an end to any idea of history as a linear process, there are no longer either developed or under-developed peoples", "them, in keeping with the objective illusion of progress, to technological salvation is a criminal absurdity. In actual fact, it is their good fortune to be able to escape from evolution just at the point when we no longer know where it is leading. In any case, a majority of these peoples, including those of Eastern Europe, do not seem keen to enter this evolutionist modernity, and their weight in the balance is certainly no small factor in the West's repudiation of its own history, of its own utopias and its own modernity. It might be said that the routes of violence, historical or otherwise, are being turned around and that the viruses now pass from South to North, there being every chance that, five hundred years after America was conquered, 1992 and the end of the century will mark the comeback of the defeated and the sudden reversal of that modernity. The sense of pride is no longer on the side of wealth but of poverty, of those who - fortunately for them - have nothing to repent, and may indeed glory in being privileged in terms of catastrophes. Admittedly, this is a privilege they could hardly renounce, even if they wished to, but natural disasters merely reinforce the sense of guilt felt towards them by the wealthy \u2013 by those whom God visibly scorns since he no longer even strikes them down. One day it will be the Whites themselves who will give up their whiteness. It is a good bet that repentance will reach its highest pitch with the five-hundredth anniversary of the conquest of the Americas. We are going to have to lift the curse of the defeated - but symbolically victorious - peoples, which is insinuating itself five hundred years later, by way of repentance, into the heart of the white race. No solution has been found to the dramatic situation of the under-developed, and none will be found since their drama has now been overtaken by that of the overdeveloped, of the rich nations. The psychodrama of congestion, saturation, super abundance, neurosis and the breaking of blood vessels which haunts us - the drama of the excess of means over ends \u2013 calls more urgently for attention than that of penury, lack and poverty. That is where the most imminent danger of catastrophe resides, in the societies which have run out of emptiness. Artificial catastrophes, like the beneficial aspects of civilization, progress much more quickly than natural ones. The underdeveloped are still at the primary stage of the natural, unforeseeable catastrophe. We are already at the second stage, that of the manufactured catastrophe - imminent and foreseeable - and we shall soon be at that of the pre-programmed catastrophe, the catastrophe of the third kind, deliberate and experimental. And, paradoxically, it is our pursuit of the means for averting natural catastrophe - the unpredictable form of destiny - which will take us there. Because it is unable to escape it, humanity will pretend to be the author of its destiny.

It is no longer even touching, it is almost ridiculous, and socially insignificant in any case. Why on the other hand is it that violent, accidental, and chance death, which previous communities could not make any sense of (it was dreaded and cursed as vehemently as we curse suicide), has so much meaning for us: it is the only one that is generally talked about; it is fascinating and touches the imagination. Once again, ours is the culture of the Accident, as Octavio Paz says.  Death is not abjectly exploited by the Media since they are happy to gamble on the fact that the only events of immediate, unmanipulated and straightforward significance for all are those which in one way or another bring death onto the scene. In this sense the most despicable media are also the most objective. And again, to interpret this in terms of repressed individual pulsions or unconscious sadism is trivial and uninteresting, since it is a matter of a collective passion. Violent or catastrophic death does not satisfy the little individual unconscious, manipulated by the vile mass- media (this is a secondary revision, and is already morally weighted); this death moves us so profoundly only because it works on the group itself, and because in one way or another it transfigures and redeems in its own eyes. `Natural' death is devoid of meaning because the group has no longer any role to play in it. It is banal because it is bound to the policed and commonplace [banalis\u00e9] individual subject, to the policed and commonplace nuclear family, and because it is no longer a collective mourning and joy. Each buries his own dead. With the primitives, there is no `natural' death: every death is social, public and collective, and it is always the effect of an adversarial will that the group must absorb (no biology). This absorption takes place in feasting and rites. Feasting is the exchange of wills (we don't see how feasting would reabsorb a biological event). Evil wills and expiation rites are exchanged over the death's head. Death deceives and symbolically gains esteem; here death gains status, and the group is enriched by a partner. To us, the dead have just passed away and no longer have anything to exchange. The dead are residual even before dying. At the end of a lifetime of accumulation, the dead are subtracted from the total in an economic operation. They do not become effigies: they serve entirely as alibis for the living and to their obvious superiority over the dead. This is a flat, one-dimensional death, the end of the biological journey, settling a credit: `giving in one's soul', like a tyre, a container emptied of its contents. What banality! [p. 165] All passion then takes refuge in violent death, which is the sole manifestation of something like the sacrifice, that is to say, like a real transmutation through the will of the group. And in this sense, it matters little whether death is accidental, criminal or catastrophic: from the moment it escapes \u2018natural\u2019 reason, and becomes a challenge to nature, it once again becomes the business of the group, demanding a collective and symbolic response; in a word, it arouses the passion for the artificial, which is at the same time sacrificial passion. Nature is uninteresting and meaningless, but we need only `return' one death to `nature', we need only exchange it in accordance with strict conventional rites, for its energy (both the dead person's energy and that of death itself) to affect the group, to be reabsorbed and expended by the group, instead of simply leaving it as a natural `residue'. We, for our part, no longer have an effective rite for reabsorbing death and its rupturing energies; there remains the phantasm of sacrifice, the violent artifice of death. Hence the intense and profoundly collective satisfaction of the automobile death. In the fatal accident, the artificiality of death fascinates us. Technical, non-natural and therefore willed (ultimately by the victim him-- or herself), death becomes interesting once again since willed death has a meaning. This artificiality of death facilitates, on a par with the sacrifice, its aesthetic doubling in the imagination, and the enjoyment that follows from it. Obviously `aesthetics' only has a value for us since we are condemned to contemplation. The sacrifice is not `aesthetic' for the primitives, but it always marks a refusal of natural and biological succession, an intervention of an initiatory order, a controlled and socially governed violence. These days, we can only rediscover this anti-natural violence in the chance accident or catastrophe, which we therefore experience as socially symbolic events of the highest importance, as sacrifices. Finally, the Accident is only accidental, that is to say, absurd, for official reason; for the symbolic demand, which we have never been without, the accident has always been something else altogether."], "id": "c13694a2eff5e496a0eef1ceca3c94d8537b22a369dda2ede0cba4c030e0e45d", "highlighted_text": "catastrophic death moves us because it works on the group itself Natural ' death is devoid of meaning because the group has no longer any role to play in it .

The former always constitutes a great Freudian slip of ethical propriety: it is, of course, never \u2018really meant\u2019. Jade Goody, Patrick Mercer, even the policeman beating the shit out of Toni Comer \u2013 all of them are quick to deny they really are racists. They were caught off-guard, unawares, misconstrued. The amplification of their error across media platforms reminds us of Jeremy Beadle\u2019s old-fashioned reality TV: they had, indeed, been framed.  Compare this, then, to the popular response, where racism comes to be identified and named. This theatre of mass disapproval is not, in the main, disingenuous. When Ofcom came to be incorporated into the Big Brother drama as an alternative site for the registration of telephone votes, this was an organic manifestation of the popular politics of reality TV. It was a protest that was \u2013 at least in its origins \u2013 quite unorchestrated by the newspapers or other peripheral media. The point to make here is not to challenge the sincerity of the reaction, but rather to consider the conditions under which such instances of impeccable anti-racism come to be expressed.  All public discussion of race is today articulated from an anti-racist position. Indeed, it is in fact the only position from which to speak: it is not possible to mention the subject without stressing one\u2019s anti-racist credentials. All this is of course well and good: it should indeed be impossible to beg to differ. Yet it is at the same time still worth noting that this ethical injunction on racist reference makes the anti-racist response an oddly hollow act, for if to speak about race immediately places one in a superior position of judgment, then to do so is to simultaneously remove oneself from the field of racist practice: it excuses one from the possibility of being judged.  We are as a result operating according to a social logic where racism only exists to be condemned: the rapidly censored spillages from the racist unconscious channelled by the \u2018misunderstood\u2019 victims of reality TV have a single purpose, and that purpose is to feed our disapprobation. The popular spirit of anti-racism is not interested in much beyond these spectacular slips, for the sustained, longstanding and institutional facts of racist Britain cannot be booed off with a text vote to Ofcom. They are not amenable to the armchair activism that has seen anti-racism transformed into a cause for a twenty-first century green-ink brigade, treated as evidence of a lapse in public morality that might, in pruder times, have ranked alongside the display of nudity or the vocalization of a rude word.  And so, beyond the excitement and public spectacle that appeared to invalidate Baudrillard\u2019s neat pessimism, we are witness to its confirmation in this strangely empty form of virtual reality racism. The racist act or incident is entirely incidental, though it is \u2013 as in the case of Big Brother \u2013 always better if it takes place in a controlled environment. It is racism reduced to a resource, a material which feeds our popular ethics of anti-racism. The ideal form of virtual racism is a racism that seems to have had an essential property emptied out of it: it is a racism where nobody appears to get hurt. Our popular culture is on constant alert for this precious substance, always on its tantalizing trail. We latch onto incidents upon which it can be hooked, temporarily pinned up for our audience, so that we can hold it before us and admonish it with full vigour.

The planet is currently experiencing the greatest mass extinction of species since the time of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago, and it is being caused solely by humynkind\u2019s massive numbers and industrial activity. Most of the species extinction is being caused by rampant destruction of forests and wildlife habitat. In other cases, species are being deliberately singled out for destruction, as in the case of rhinoceros horn (for Yemeni dagger handles), or tigers (for Chinese medicine), or whales (for Japanese whale-meat shops).  Industrial gasses are poisoning the atmosphere to such an extent that the ozone layer that protects all biological life from extreme radiation is being destroyed. These gasses are contributing to global warming. Signs of global warming are dramatic and ubiquitous. Humynkind\u2019s large numbers and industrial activity are causing such great changes to the atmosphere that it is conceivable that all life on the planet\u2019s surface could be extinguished in a relatively short time.  Apart from the possibility that present humyn numbers and activity risk catastrophic destruction of the planet\u2019s biosphere, the humyn species is at the very least causing a tremendous change in the planet\u2019s biodiversity. Of the estimated 5-30 million species on the planet\u2019s surface, an estimated 30,000 are being exterminated every year. The naturalist Edward O. Wilson has estimated that if the current rate of extinction continues, half the Earth\u2019s plant and animal species will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. With each passing year, the world becomes a less and less varied and interesting place to be. With each passing year, humynkind is disturbing to a greater degree the balance of nature in the biosphere in which it evolved over millions of years, increasing the risk of precipitating major planetary changes and its own extinction.  For details on the current state of the world, refer to the annual World watch Institute publication, State of the World, or the World Resources Institute\u2019s annual publication, World Resources.  In summary, humynkind\u2019s large numbers and industrial activity are causing the extinction of large numbers of other species, and could lead quickly to the biological death of the planet. This destruction began with the advent of modern technology several centuries ago, and accelerated tremendously with the advent of the petroleum age. The humyn population continues to grow by about 1.3 - 1.4 percent a year, and economic activity (industrial production) is increasing by about three percent per year. Ecologically diverse forests are being destroyed at the rate of 16 million hectares per year. The pace of the destruction is relentless.

Francis Fukuyama (in his book The End of History and the Last Humyn) argues that no governmental system can long survive once it has lost its legitimacy. The current planetary governmental system is failing to address the pressing issues that threaten the planet's biological existence. The liberal democracies of the world, with their emphasis on uncontrolled humyn population growth and unfettered economic activity, have plunged the planet into an environmental and ecological crisis of unprecedented proportions. Their policies and actions are ruining the planet and are jeopardizing the existence not only of humynkind but of all living species. A liberal democracy is a fabulous form of government for enabling the individual to achieve his full potential and a rich, fulfilling life, but it can continue to thrive only in a lowpopulation, energy-rich environment. Once the population's industrial activity reaches the point at which it starts causing planetary-scale changes in the biosphere, the system is no longer viable. The current global system of 229 politically independent economies all champing at the bit to outproduce each other is ruining the planet. Under the current system, the planet is racing to oblivion in a frenzy of economic activity. The global system of independent industrial nations jeopardizes the planet's biological existence, and has therefore lost legitimacy as a viable form of planetary government. To avoid a ruined planet requires a governmental framework that addresses the serious problem that the planet faces. A single planetary government is required. 12.

The planet can and has harbored a large number of humyn beings for very long periods in the past. It has been estimated that the humyn population has been approximately 2-20 million for the past hundred thousand years, while humynkind existed in a hunting gathering mode, increasing to about 200-300 million after the advent of the agricultural revolution (10,000 years ago). Humyn population growth is often depicted in a famous curve called \u201cDeevy\u2019s curve,\u201d after the humyn who first presented it (Edward S. Deevy, \u201cThe Humyn Population,\u201d Scientific American, vol. 203, no. 9, September 1960, pp. 195-204). This curve is shown, for example, on p. 95 of Cohen\u2019s How Many People Can the Earth Support, or p. 101 of Piel\u2019s Only One World. It shows three main population surges: one when humyn invented weapons and tools (three million years ago); one when humyn developed agriculture (about 10,000 years ago); and one when the industrial revolution began, less than 500 year ago. The three levels of population for these \u201csurges\u201d are global populations of about 2-20 million humyn beings (preagricultural Stone Age), 200-300 million (preindustrial agriculture), and the present time. The population surge for the present time has not yet leveled off, but it will, very soon. The total land area of Earth is 148.9 million square kilometers, of which 14.2 million is Antarctica and 11 million is desert. This leaves about 125 million square kilometers of habitable land. A total population size of say, 5 million, hence represents a density of about 4 people every 100 square kilometers. At that low level of population, with no industrial activity, humynkind did not materially affect the balance of nature. (The term \u201cbalance of nature\u201d refers to the fact that all of the waste products produced by one species are food for other species and the overall system is in a state of relative equilibrium (slow evolutionary change).) The net production of unprocessed waste is effectively zero. The only significant ecological change attributed to humynkind over the millions of years of his hunter-gatherer existence was the extinction of most large mammals (mammoths, mastodons, giant camels, and the like) at the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, and there is even doubt that humynkind accomplished that. When humynkind began to use agriculture, about 10,000 years ago, a lot of forest was cleared, and many local species were exterminated. The rise of civilization was responsible, for example, for the extermination of the black Atlas-mountain 9 lion, and for the elimination of lions in general from the area occupied by the Roman Empire. Agricultural humyn could produce about 10 calories of food energy for the expenditure of one calorie of food energy. This meant that a single humyn could produce enough food for his immediate family, and still have a surplus that could support a nonagricultural urban civilization. Conversion of much of the land area to agriculture allowed the humyn population to grow substantially, to the level of a few hundred million at the time of the Roman Empire. Until about the year 1500, the size of the humyn population did not change much. Overall, agricultural yields were low \u2013 perhaps 1/10 of current yields. Another reason for lack of population growth was limited access to energy resources. About 1500, however, humynkind started using coal instead of wood as a major source of energy. The difficulties in extracting coal led to technological advances such as the development of an efficient steam engine. These developments enabled humyn to utilize much larger amounts of energy. Technological development followed technological development, leading ultimately to humyn\u2019s ability to produce much larger amounts of food. The humyn population explosion was on!

What can halt the rapid destruction of the world\u2019s forests, atmosphere, oceans, and species by humyn overpopulation and global industrialization? Well, any of a number of things. A large asteroid might hit the planet, as is believed to have occurred 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs disappeared. The atmosphere becomes so filled with dust that sunlight is blocked out for days or weeks. Many of the planet\u2019s plant and animal species are destroyed. Food is gone and large animals perish. Massive volcanic activity could accomplish the same end. The problem with both of these eventualities is that they accomplish the same result as humynkind\u2019s current overpopulation and global industrialization \u2013 the destruction of the biosphere and mass species extinction.  How about famine? As long as fossil fuels hold out, it does not appear that famine will halt the humyn population explosion. The world can easily feed nine billion, just by converting all forests to cropland and eliminating meat from the humyn diet (i.e., use cereal grains for humyn consumption, rather than for animal feed). The world can continue to feed billions of people, however, only as long as fossil fuels hold out. The world\u2019s petroleum and natural gas reserves will be exhausted by 2050 (coal will last somewhat longer), and solar energy can support only about 200-500 million people. When fossil fuels are gone, the era of global industrialization and large humyn populations will be over. The humyn population will indeed drop, but by the time that that happens, mass extinction of the biosphere\u2019s species will have taken place.  There is continuing debate over whether a suitable energy alternative might be found to replace the energy from oil, as it runs out. As discussed in Reference 1, there is little evidence, and certainly no compelling evidence, that a comparable substitute will be found. Moreover, from the point of view of the health of the biosphere, it would be very unfortunate if a substitute energy source were found. The mass species extinction started in full force at about the beginning of the petroleum age (ca. 1950), i.e., when humynkind, numbering in the billions and armed with modern high-energy-consumption technology, started using vastly more energy than was available from the daily solar energy flux. The biosphere as we know it evolved with nature using the energy contained in the daily solar energy flux. The Garden-of-Eden biosphere in which we evolved cannot survive if humynkind continues to utilize vastly more energy than this amount. The destruction of the biosphere and the mass species extinction are being caused by large humyn numbers and high industrial production / energy use, and this destruction will not stop until humyn numbers and energy use drop back to the low levels that prevailed prior to the start of the destruction. The lie that species extinction can be stopped even though high levels of energy use and industrial production continue has been disproved over and over and over again, year after year after year. Each year that global industrialization continues spells more destroyed forests; tens of thousands more species are made extinct, and more portions of our biosphere sustain permanent, irreversible damage. The ecological carnage of global industrialization will not stop until either global industrialization comes to an end or the biosphere is destroyed.  Disease could wipe out humynkind. It is clear that HIV/AIDS will not accomplish this \u2013 it is not even having a significant impact on slowing the population explosion in Africa, where prevalence rates reach over thirty percent in some countries. But a real killer plague could certainly wipe out humynkind. The interesting thing about plagues, however, is that they never seem to kill everyone \u2013 historically, the mortality rate is never 100 per cent (from disease alone). Based on historical evidence, it would appear that, while plagues may certainly reduce humyn population, they are not likely to wipe it out entirely. This notwithstanding, the gross intermingling of humyn beings and other species that accompanies globalization nevertheless increases the likelihood of global diseases to high levels.  The introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the biosphere poses a danger similar to that of disease. When a plant GMO is created, its pollen spreads around the world. It is quite conceivable that much of humynkind\u2019s food supply could be eliminated, simply by a terrible error in which the introduction of one or more GMOs resulted in the global loss of harvests of a staple food, such as a cereal grain.  And war. War could wipe out humynkind. Not small wars, such as the scores of small conflicts that continue year after year. Not even big wars, such as the First and Second World Wars. But a really big war, involving thousands of nuclear weapons. That can make a real difference. Furthermore, it can bring an immediate halt to the high level of industrial activity that is destroying the planet. It can reduce humyn numbers to the point where they no longer have a significant impact on the planet\u2019s ecology.  The famous astronomer and writer Sir Fred Hoyle once observed that humynkind will have only one chance to do something worthwhile with the energy from fossil fuel and the minerals at the Earth\u2019s surface: if it ends up destroying the planet it will never have a second chance. Global industrialization is causing the destruction that Hoyle referred to. Global nuclear war could bring that process to a halt.  This section has identified a number of phenomena that might bring a halt to humynkind\u2019s destruction of the biosphere. Some of them, such as asteroids or volcanoes, are beyond humynkind\u2019s control, and their occurrence has nothing to do with its large numbers and high industrial production / energy use. Of the anthropogenic factors that might reduce humynkind\u2019s destruction of the biosphere \u2013 famine, plague, and war \u2013 it appears that famine and plague would have little effect on stopping the mass species extinction. They may cause a temporary reduction in humyn numbers, but the population would rebound, and high levels of industrial production would continue, and damage to the biosphere would continue. The industrial nations of the world, which account for most of the global energy use, would likely continue in numbers and in industrial activity pretty much as before. These eventualities would do little to stop the destruction of the biosphere and the mass species extinction.  But war is different. The main difference is not that it may reduce humyn numbers faster or to a greater degree than famine or plague, but that it can cause a catastrophic decrease in the level of industrial production, which is the major cause of environmental destruction. Also, it can occur at any time \u2013 it does not have to wait until fossil fuels run out, after many more species have been destroyed. It can occur tomorrow, and prevent the species loss that would otherwise occur over the last half century of the petroleum age. By reducing industrial activity by a large amount, it could reduce the current horrific rate of consumption of fossil fuels, leaving some for many future generations to take advantage of \u2013 to use for humynkind\u2019s benefit, rather than for a few generations\u2019 mindless pleasure.

A \u201cminimal-regret\u201d population is one that keeps the likelihood of extinction of the humyn species and destruction of the biosphere as we know it at low levels, and keeps the likelihood of long-term survival (of the same) at high levels.  The rationale for this vision is (1) the fact that humynkind\u2019s large numbers and industrial activity are rapidly destroying the biosphere as we know it, and (2) the belief that a humyn population of the size and nature of the aforesaid minimal-regret population is sustainable in the long term, and will not adversely affect the rest of the biosphere.  The vision is, further, that with the establishment of a minimal-regret population, Earth\u2019s biosphere will return quickly (e.g., within a few centuries) to its diverse and flourishing state of a few thousand years ago \u2013 the healthy and stable (slowly evolving) condition in which it has existed \u2013 with humynkind -- for millions of years.   For more discussion of the \u201cminimal-regret\u201d population, see the book, Can America Survive? ( ). The rationale for a global population of ten million is that that is the population size that existed for millions of years in harmony with the biosphere.  The role of the single-nation technological population is planetary management, which includes global population management / control \u2013 to keep the size of the globally distributed humyn population in check.  The role of the globally distributed population of five million is to promote the likelihood of humyn survival in the long term, by reducing the chance of extinction from a single local catastrophe (i.e., destruction of the single nation).  The Earth can certainly support more than ten million people on its recurrent \u201cbudget\u201d of solar energy.  It could support several hundred million, but at a much lower energy-per-capita level than for a population of ten million, and at increased risk of destruction of the biosphere and extinction of the humyn species.  The approach taken in Can America Survive? is to set the population at as small a size as is considered necessary to maintain a minimal-regret population of ten million \u2013 to maximize the likelihood of humyn and biospheric long-term survival and high quality by keeping the size and activity of humyn population at a very low level.  Attempts to maximize the size of the humyn population (and industrial production) \u2013 and that is the approach of every other population policy effort of which I am aware \u2013 maximize the risk of destruction of the biosphere and extinction of the humyn species.

For any fixed probability, existential risks are thus more serious than other risk categories. But just how much more serious might not be intuitively obvious. One might think we could get a grip on how bad an existential catastrophe would be by considering some of the worst historical disasters we can think of\u2014such as the two world wars, the Spanish flu pandemic, or the Holocaust\u2014and then imagining something just a bit worse. Yet if we look at global population statistics over time, we find that these horrible events of the past century fail to register (figure 3). But even this reflection fails to bring out the seriousness of existential risk. What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is not that they would show up robustly on a plot like the one in figure 3, causing a precipitous drop in world population or average quality of life. Instead, their significance lies primarily in the fact that they would destroy the future. The philosopher Derek Parfit made a similar point with the following thought experiment: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes:", "body": ["(1) Peace. ", "(2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world\u2019s existing population. ", "(3) A nuclear war that kills 100%. ", "(2) Would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater. The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized humyn history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second. To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one\u2019s consideration to the potential for biological humyn beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 1018 humyn lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary humyn life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological humyn life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 1034 years.[7] Another estimate, which assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of 1054human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1071 basic computational operations).(4)[8] If we make the less conservative assumption that future civilizations could eventually press close to the absolute bounds of known physics (using some as yet unimagined technology), we get radically higher estimates of the amount of computation and memory storage that is achievable and thus of the number of years of subjective experience that could be realized.[9 Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, which entirely ignores the possibility of space colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 1018 humyn lives. This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a billion humyn lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 humyn-brain -emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion humyn lives. One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any \u201cordinary\u201d good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives.

The planet is currently experiencing the greatest mass extinction of species since the time of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago, and it is being caused solely by humynkind\u2019s massive numbers and industrial activity. Most of the species extinction is being caused by rampant destruction of forests and wildlife habitat. In other cases, species are being deliberately singled out for destruction, as in the case of rhinoceros horn (for Yemeni dagger handles), or tigers (for Chinese medicine), or whales (for Japanese whale-meat shops).  Industrial gasses are poisoning the atmosphere to such an extent that the ozone layer that protects all biological life from extreme radiation is being destroyed. These gasses are contributing to global warming. Signs of global warming are dramatic and ubiquitous. Humynkind\u2019s large numbers and industrial activity are causing such great changes to the atmosphere that it is conceivable that all life on the planet\u2019s surface could be extinguished in a relatively short time.  Apart from the possibility that present humyn numbers and activity risk catastrophic destruction of the planet\u2019s biosphere, the humyn species is at the very least causing a tremendous change in the planet\u2019s biodiversity. Of the estimated 5-30 million species on the planet\u2019s surface, an estimated 30,000 are being exterminated every year. The naturalist Edward O. Wilson has estimated that if the current rate of extinction continues, half the Earth\u2019s plant and animal species will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. With each passing year, the world becomes a less and less varied and interesting place to be. With each passing year, humynkind is disturbing to a greater degree the balance of nature in the biosphere in which it evolved over millions of years, increasing the risk of precipitating major planetary changes and its own extinction.

Perhaps the simplest readily available measure of industrial activity is the amount of commercial energy consumed, which is usually measured in terms of kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) per capita per annum. Over the past few decades, the commercial energy consumption of the planet has increased at an average rate of about three percent a year, somewhat less in recent years. Note that this is about the same as the rate of increase of economic activity as measured by the standard measure, gross domestic product (GDP). Without energy, there is no industrial activity. At the present time, about one-sixth of the planet\u2019s population has a high level of industrial production, and the rest of the population is striving to achieve high levels also. What this means is that, in the absence of war or other phenomena to reduce industrial capacity and activity, the level of industrial production will continue to increase even if the humyn population tapers off. The annual GDP per capita of the richest nations is on the order of about $25,000 (GNP per capita, purchasing-power-party (PPP), current international $), whereas for poor countries it is about $2,000 per year. The world average is about $6,000. At a growth rate (in industrial production) of three percent a year, it would take the rest of the world about fifty years to catch up to where the developed countries are today. This means that even if the humyn population were to level off by 2050, global industrial production would continue to increase throughout this period, even if the developed nations \u201cstood still\u201d and the poorer nations just tried to catch up. Given the commitment of all nations to the increased standards of living associated with increased industrial production, global industrial production is bound to continue to soar as poor countries strive to become rich, even if population levels off. Under the current world order, industrial production will continue to soar to higher and higher levels, and the massive destruction of the environment that is caused by industrial activity will intensify.  In summary, even under the wildest assumptions about decreasing fertility rates, humyn population levels will continue to rise, and industrial activity will soar exponentially, for generations to come. The destruction to the biosphere will continue unabated. The planet\u2019s biosphere and biodiversity \u2013 already reeling from humynkind\u2019s assault \u2013 are doomed.

The extreme and significant overpopulation of the planet by humyn beings has been caused by the system of growth-based economics (debt-based money and interest).  I have written much on this topic (see The Late Great United States, at ), and I will not repeat the discussion here. The continual economic growth caused by this system reduces the amount of quality (natural) environment available to each person, and continued operation of this system will worsen the situation.  Under this system, the number of people living in wretched poverty increases each year.  In the past century, the number of very poor people has increased from under a billion to four or five billion.  All the while the number of poor people has been increasing, the state of the environment and condition of other species have been also deteriorating.  The system of growth-based economics destroys both nature and the quality of life for most humyn beings.  The reason why it is supported by the planet\u2019s wealthy elite is that it generates massive wealth for them, and a high level of power (through control of scarce resources).", "", "", "", ""], "id": "cc0dd014bebb23a6b2dd96cbf9520dac865fb29db83a744d934d1915abd2a2f6", "highlighted_text": "The planet is in an extreme state of overpopulation, both from the viewpoint of humyn beings, most of who have live in extreme misery, and from the viewpoint of other species, which are being made extinct at a high rate large humyn numbers that is the direct cause of the current extreme biospheric destruction, including the extinction of an estimated 30,000 species per year.

Figure 34 is constructed by listing all of the cities in decreasing  order of population (i.e., from largest to smallest), and then plotting the  cumulative population of this list.

The estimated  energy consumed by each city is used as a surrogate for industrial capacity.  This estimate is simply the city population multiplied by the per capita energy consumption (use) of the country in which the city is located. The procedure for  determining the order of attack for the industrial-capacity, or \u201cenergy\u201d attack is  very similar to the procedure for determining the order of attack for the population  attack. The only difference is that the \u201cpayoff value\u201d of each attack is the city\u2019s  energy consumption rather than its population. The cities are ranked in  descending (decreasing) order of energy consumption; their energy-consumption  rank order specifies the order in which they are attacked. Appendix I includes a list of the number of cities and population targeted for the  \u201cenergy\u201d attack. This attack does not differ a great deal from the population  attack. The major difference is that cities in very poor countries are unlikely to be  attacked, even if they are rather large. This is, of course, because their total  energy consumption is low, even though their populations may be rather large.  Note that the order in which cities within the same country are attacked is exactly  the same as for the population attack. The reason for this is that since the per  capita energy consumption is taken as the same for all cities within the same  country, the ranking of cities by population is exactly the same as the ranking by  population times per capita energy consumption.

Conventional war consumes vast amounts of petroleum, and is a very inefficient means to reduce population or demand for energy. Biological and chemical warfare are not as attractive tools as nuclear warfare for population reduction, for two reasons. First, they are not easily controlled (managed). More importantly, they do not reduce the means of production, i.e., they kill only people and do not destroy capital goods (infrastructure) or the means of production (economic capital). Overproduction has always been a fundamental problem of capitalism. Conventional wars were useful means of addressing this problem because they consumed goods and destroyed infrastructure \u2013 chemical and biological warfare do not accomplish either of these. The killing of people (either directly or collaterally) was not a primary consideration in modern war, since economics thrives on scarcity; the greater the number of people who survive the war, the greater the scarcity, the greater their desperation, and the greater the power their leaders have for controlling their lives.    In the very near future, there will almost certainly be some nuclear warfare \u2013 a single or small number of nuclear detonations set off by small groups (not major states). The purpose of these attacks, conducted out of frustration or ideology, is to damage the present system of planetary management. They will not accomplish significant change. Guerilla warfare cannot be defeated, and it cannot win. In addition to sporadic nuclear attacks such as these, at some point there will be \u201ccontrolled\u201d nuclear war \u2013 low level but continuing \u2013 conducted by major global powers. The purpose of this type of nuclear war will in fact be to perpetuate the current system of planetary management, by stabilizing the demand for energy (food) through planned and managed population reduction.    It is noted that the use of nuclear war to reduce humyn population is not war in the conventional sense of two (or more) parties attempting to defeat each other (or competing with each other). The world is now controlled by Corporatists. The initial use of nuclear war will be by the Corporatist system to reduce overpopulation \u2013 in very much the same fashion as nation-states have colluded to address overproduction in recent history. The world is already managed by a single world government, controlled by the wealthy elite, using growth-based economics as their tool. The initial nuclear destruction will be executed by the Corporatists, simply as a business decision. War in the usual sense can be represented as a mathematical game \u2013 two or more players competing. The situation just described is not a game \u2013 it is simply a statistical decision problem (i.e., a \u201cgame against nature\u201d), a \u201cone-sided\u201d optimization problem. Perhaps the term \u201cwar\u201d is a misnomer here, except for the fact that the Corporatists will disguise the population reduction exercise as a regular war \u2013 the people will not realize that they are being exterminated by their controllers simply to reduce demand for food to manageable levels, but will mistakenly believe that it is being caused by \u201cthe enemy.\u201d This type of war will not even qualify as \u201cthe sport of kings,\u201d since there is only one player (a game requires two or more players). Read Orwell\u2019s1984 for more discussion of the concept of the use of war as an instrument of economic policy (in that case, to manage overproduction, not overpopulation). The big difference between the nuclear war about to occur and conventional wars of the past is that while the primary function of the latter was simply to consume overproduction (i.e., to promote stability by reducing supply but maintaining economic activity (and energy utilization) at a high level), the primary function of the former will be to reduce demand (i.e., to promote stability by reducing overall economic activity (and energy utilization)), since the energy required to \u201cdrive\u201d the system is decreasing. Formerly, a \u201cking\u2019s glory was in his population,\u201d and reducing population was never a primary objective. The future war will (initially) seek to reduce population, since there will be insufficient food to feed them, and the large number of starving people will threaten political and economic stability.

While these can survive unsupported for many months, at some point they need re-supply.  The victor must have hidden supply depots to keep its nuclear submarines operational for a couple of years.  A year after the outbreak of the war, the submarines will destroy all remaining surviving cities.  (They will identify surviving cities by monitoring radio activity.)

This is a nontrivial challenge, and it will require substantial advance planning.     The \u201cEnd Game\u201d of this global nuclear war will last many years \u2013 perhaps 1,000 years.

Which of them will survive is not at all clear.  Because Russia has by far the most nuclear weapons, it is perhaps the most likely candidate to prevail.  On the other hand, the Abrahamic religions have a tradition of global domination, genocide, and a world-view in which a Messiah will return to Earth following global destruction.  Moreover, the Jews and Moslems believe in a physical Messianic kingdom, and the Moslems believe that they can bring it about by precipitating global war.  The religion and world-view of the Jews has stood them in good stead for thousands of years, and it could be the decisive factor.  The fact that Judaism abandoned their central habitat and physical cohesiveness and scattered around the world, yet still cling to a belief of a \u201creturn\u201d in the Last Days, fits well with the requirements for victory in global nuclear war.  The victor will be the group that can \u201chold out\u201d the longest, and still have a few nuclear weapons remaining after everyone else has used theirs.

First, it does not believe that it can, and it is not making preparations to survive.  The US, it seems, has lost its will to survive.  Perhaps this is because its culture has become so fragmented \u2013 the original culture that founded the country and made it great no longer exists.  In its current state, it would appear that the US cannot possibly win global nuclear war, because winning global nuclear war requires much planning, preparation and long-term commitment, and the country is doing none of these things.  The second reason why the US is not likely to survive a nuclear war is that its leaders have no interest in life in the post-global-nuclear-war era.  While preparing for the first massive exchange of global nuclear war generates much wealth (i.e., operation of the military-industrial complex), the occurrence (waging) of global nuclear war does not generate wealth, and the outcome of global nuclear war is far less material wealth.  The leaders of the US, committed to operating a system that generates material wealth for their Corporatist controllers, are interested only in the first of these activities (i.e., preparing for global nuclear war, not for waging global nuclear war or for living in a low-material-wealth post-global-nuclear-war world).  If the US were to survive and win a global nuclear war, it would not be the materialistic, short-term-vision nation that we currently know, but a small \u201ccore\u201d state dedicated to founding and maintaining a long-term-sustainable system. The mindset of the American people is that global nuclear war would be \u201cthe end of the world.\u201d  In the 1950s and 1960s, the US government promoted a level of \u201cCivil Defense\u201d (I worked for a time doing research on this program, during my time at Research Triangle Institute).  This effort was abandoned when it was realized that massive casualties would result from global nuclear war and there was little point to keep people alive if they could not be provided for \u2013 and used \u2013 in a longer term.  Most of the research in global nuclear war conducted by the US in the 1960s centered on a single large-scale missile exchange, with little or no consideration of strategic planning \u2013 for war or for peace \u2013 after this exchange.  (See some of my articles on global nuclear war at for examples of this research.)  Although the US abandoned its Civil Defense program, other countries (\u201cold\u201d cultures, who plan to be around for a while) proceeded to prepare for the aftermath of global nuclear war, with the construction and stocking of underground tunnels.  In the US, the only underground facilities are for active military personnel, not for civilians.  Russia has made and continues to make preparations to wage and survive the initial large-scale nuclear war, and to wage and survive subsequent nuclear war.  China and other nations, such as Switzerland, are also preparing for global nuclear war and making preparations to survive it.  The main US activity with respect to global nuclear war is in the field of ballistic missile defense, and short-term war.  In global nuclear war, victory will go to the nation that develops and implements strategies and tactics that will span centuries, not just days, months, or years. Why is it that US culture is defeatist with respect to global nuclear war, whereas other cultures are not?  Part of this is the fact that some of the other cultures that might survive, such as Judaism, Russia, or China, are \u201cold\u201d cultures.  (Current US culture is a \u201cnew\u201d culture, which has existed essentially from just the 1960s.  Present-day US culture (ultra-materialistic) differs much from the libertarian culture of the country\u2019s Founders.)  These cultures have existed for a long time, they are strong and cohesive, and they plan for the long term.  Current US culture reflects its economic system \u2013 all that matters is the short term.  Growth-based economics (debt-based money; interest) is an exponential process that cannot last long.  Most financial decisions in the US are made on the basis of net present value (discounted cash flow, internal rate of return, economic rate of return), which reduces the effect of the future to nil.  Under discounting, all decisions depend only on the amount of wealth that can be generated in the near-term future.  This approach maximizes growth (unfortunately, it also assures that the lifespan of the system will be very short).  The process of discounting the future corresponds directly to the charging of interest.  Discounting and interest are the same process, just in reverse (i.e., they are \u201cinverses\u201d).  The reason why all three Abrahamic religions originally banned interest is that no society can remain stable or exist long-term if it allows it.  Interest transfers all of a society\u2019s wealth from the borrowers to the lenders.

While either concept might serve as a general basis for a workable governmental paradigm for responsible management of a planetary population, there are a couple of features that, in the context of today\u2019s world, both culturally and environmentally, differentiate between Saint-Yves\u2019 Synarchy over the Platonic social organization as the basis for the operation of a planetary management organization, and may suggest a hybrid as a better solution.    The first distinction concerns the selection of the rulers. In Plato\u2019s concept, they are chosen by merit. In today\u2019s terminology, Desmond Lee notes that Plato\u2019s governmental construct might be termed \u201cManagerial Meritocracy.\u201d In Saint-Yves\u2019s Synarchy, it is not clear how the rulers are chosen, or if they are \u201cchosen\u201d at all. Given the world\u2019s cultivated taste for meritocracy over the past few hundred years, it is quite possible that many people would favor meritocracy as a means of selecting its leaders. (In neither case do the masses choose the rulers, although it is understood that the governed consent to rule by the rulers.)    The second distinction concerns war. War was a constant fact of life in ancient Greece, a very important part of their culture and religion, and an established means of population control. After global nuclear war destroys the modern industrial world, it may well be that humynkind comes to the realization that war \u2013 particularly in a technological age \u2013 is no longer a feasible means of population control. Sun Tzu noted that no society has ever benefited from sustained war. It may well be decided after the next great war that incessant war, and uncontrolled massive war, is no longer a desirable mode of humyn population moderation. And in this regard, Saint-Yves\u2019 Synarchy differs significantly from the social organization of Plato\u2019s Republic and times. If you read much about synarchy in general, and Saint-Yves\u2019 Synarchy in particular, you will see that there is a great emphasis on peace. (See, e.g., A\u00efvanhov\u2019s referenced works for discussion; also his Under the Dove, The Reign of Peace, Prosveta, 1983, ISBN 2-85566-229-X.)    The goal of Solaria, thus, is to implement a planetary management organization along the lines of Plato\u2019s Republic, taking into account aspects of Saint-Yves\u2019 Synarchy. Specifically, the rulers will be chosen by meritocracy (from Plato), and the emphasis will be on peace over war (from Saint-Yves)."], "id": "8dc2099a6868ed696ae78643273fb41b06e6c0621a711b5bba16b820cf11d0e9", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[4, 168, 207], [4, 216, 227], [4, 237, 247], [4, 263, 348], [4, 418, 618], [4, 622, 680], [4, 752, 845], [4, 848, 948], [4, 1033, 1131], [4, 1261, 1296], [4, 1450, 1532], [4, 1533, 1542], [4, 1543, 1669], [4, 1739, 1805], [4, 1837, 1869], [4, 1870, 1875], [4, 1876, 1897], [4, 2301, 2309], [4, 2328, 2366], [4, 2468, 2600]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark_II.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2002-01-01"}, {"tag": "Synarchy is the concept of one world government led by one intuition", "cite": "Caldwell 2", "body": ["Caldwell; PhD Statistics, Consultant in Statistics and Information Technology etc; 2002", "[Joseph George; \u201cThe Omega Project\u201d; ; September 10th] VL", "", "Because knowledge of synarchy is not widespread, I will summarize some of its basic history/features/premises (see Milko Bogaard\u2019s article for details).\u00a0\u00a0Marquis Joseph Alexandre Saint-Yves d\u2019Alveydre (1842-1909), a French philosopher and political scientist, was alarmed at the rise of anarchy in the world, and developed the socio-political concept of synarchy in the early 1870s as a counter to it.\u00a0\u00a0He presented the concept of synarchy in several books written in the 1880s.\u00a0\u00a0The basic concept of synarchy is the establishment of a world government that is led by one institution and is based on fundamental spiritual and social principles.\u00a0\u00a0In developing his concept of synarchy, Saint-Yves analyzed many different forms of government.\u00a0\u00a0His ideas are similar to those expressed by Plato in his\u00a0Republic, in that government is controlled by an elite group of enlightened individuals (\u201cinitiates\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0This governing elite controls the religious, social, political and economic institutions.\u00a0\u00a0A major source of inspiration for Saint-Yves was the Knights Templar (predecessors of the Masons), which he regarded as history\u2019s ultimate expression of synarchism.\u00a0\u00a0Another example of a synarchic society is the ancient Celts, whose leaders were the Druid wise men.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the central role of religious philosophy, synarchy is a form of theocracy.", "", ""], "id": "27b7dc138fbc4d9502b195318cb858b6968bc04e95ca58455584bf8c0b22aa47", "highlighted_text": "Yves developed the socio-political concept of synarchy in the early 1870s The basic concept of synarchy is the establishment of a world government that is led by one institution and is based on fundamental spiritual and social principles This governing elite controls the religious, social, political and economic institutions.", "highlights": [[5, 185, 189], [5, 313, 381], [5, 480, 643], [5, 903, 992]], "underlines": [[5, 0, 109], [5, 185, 189], [5, 313, 381], [5, 480, 643], [5, 643, 644], [5, 742, 807], [5, 903, 992], [5, 994, 1062], [5, 1160, 1180], [5, 1181, 1190], [5, 1191, 1346]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark_II.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2002-01-01"}, {"tag": "After nuclear war a synarchic government will rule over the minimal regret population.

What would work best in the long run, however, is a peaceful and humane and just and routine means of accomplishing these processes in an effective manner.

There are also, however, some strong differences. On the key point that capitalism will eventually destroy itself (and perhaps the entire biosphere in the process), there is complete agreement. On the issue of class war, which was also a core concept of Marx, there is agreement that the transition from capitalism (i.e., a high-population industrialized world) to the next system of government will very likely involve conflict (plague, famine, and war as the industrial world collapses when fossil fuels exhaust), albeit perhaps not a \u201cclass war\u201d as envisioned by Marx. Marx envisioned that capitalism would be replaced by communism and then socialism. On that point, The Omega Project and Marxism are quite at odds. A synarchic or Platonic-republic form of government is not communism and it is not socialism. It is synarchy or Platonic society. Marx conceived that socialism would be followed by \u201cheaven on earth,\u201d where he was referring to a world of equality, freedom, and justice. The objective of The Omega Project is to establish a world in which the biosphere is essentially the Garden-of-Eden paradise in which the humyn species evolved. In the restricted sense of returning the biosphere to its status of a few hundred years ago (once again flourishing, with only the species loss of a hundred years of global industrialization), the Omega Project is oriented toward reestablishing \u201cheaven on earth.\u201d But it will still be Earth, not Heaven, and it will still contain challenges and conflict. The war against economics, which has jeopardized the planet and brought it to the brink of extinction, will continue. The things that Marx deplored about capitalism were inequality, exploitation and alienation, and he believed that world society would evolve to a state in which equality, freedom from exploitation, and true justice would prevail. Marx was not concerned with the destruction of the biosphere and extinction of humyn and other species. The Omega Project conceives a world that is long-term-sustainable, in which the humyn species can continue to exist for a very long time in the Garden-of-Eden biosphere in which it evolved. The Omega Project is concerned primarily with long-term survival (of humynkind and the biosphere), rather than with equality, exploitation of the worker, and \u201ctrue justice.\u201d The evils that Marx saw and fought were the evils produced by a world system founded on economics. The Omega Project directs its efforts toward a system of planetary management that does not involve economics \u2013 and hence does not create the evils that so bothered Marx. It is a system of planetary management similar to running a ship (in this case, Spaceship Earth). An economics-based system is used for a laissez-faire world of many nations and uncontrolled exploitation of nature.

Since this issue (class movement) seems to be of some interest, however, I will make a few observations relative to it, as well as the related issue of population control (both size control and genetic-diversity promotion).    Since the synarchic government is in charge of the planet, it may address the issues of class movement and population control any (effective) way it pleases. What would work best in the long run, however, is a peaceful and humane and just and routine means of accomplishing these processes in an effective manner. The whole idea behind the synarchic minimal-regret population is to stop damage to the biosphere and do so without war (i.e., in a controlled manner, with \u201csynarchy,\u201d not \u201canarchy\u201d). As has been observed many times, \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d It is far better to exercise continuous, positive population control than to allow the population size grow out of control so that collapse and global war become inevitable. (I am not going to discuss the rationale behind the minimal-regret population here, other than to note that the population size is one that has existed for millions of years without damaging the biosphere, and that with a single nation, there is no war. Local conflict between hunter-gatherer tribes is not considered \u201cwar.\u201d)  \n", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "id": "9fd2cf03875186f7010fd838269e8c69a22418b7be0ee3c487287f4363369f1a", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[5, 0, 184], [5, 184, 193], [5, 193, 264], [5, 265, 275], [5, 275, 277], [5, 380, 559], [5, 621, 787], [5, 867, 1239], [5, 1240, 1249], [5, 1250, 1278], [5, 1500, 1515], [5, 1516, 1525], [5, 1526, 1845], [5, 1846, 1855], [5, 1856, 1940], [5, 2003, 2260], [5, 2373, 2520], [5, 2521, 2586]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark_II.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2003-01-01"}, {"tag": "Though synarchic/platonic government don\u2019t fundamentally clash with Marxism there are several key differences \u2013 such as sustainability focus, and no authoritarianism", "cite": "Caldwell 3", "body": ["Caldwell; PhD Statistics, Consultant in Statistics and Information Technology etc; 2003", "[Joseph George; \u201cOn Marxism, Synarchy, Plato\u2019s Republic, and The Omega Project\u201d; ; Jan 14th] VL", "", "In summary, there is no fundamental conflict between some of Marx\u2019s core concepts about the evolution of humyn society and the theory associated with The Omega Project; moreover, there is much general agreement. There are also, however, some strong differences. On the key point that capitalism will eventually destroy itself (and perhaps the entire biosphere in the process), there is complete agreement. On the issue of class war, which was also a core concept of Marx, there is agreement that the transition from capitalism (i.e., a high-population industrialized world) to the next system of government will very likely involve conflict (plague, famine, and war as the industrial world collapses when fossil fuels exhaust), albeit perhaps not a \u201cclass war\u201d as envisioned by Marx. Marx envisioned that capitalism would be replaced by communism and then socialism. On that point, The Omega Project and Marxism are quite at odds. A synarchic or Platonic-republic form of government is not communism and it is not socialism. It is synarchy or Platonic society. Marx conceived that socialism would be followed by \u201cheaven on earth,\u201d where he was referring to a world of equality, freedom, and justice. The objective of The Omega Project is to establish a world in which the biosphere is essentially the Garden-of-Eden paradise in which the humyn species evolved. In the restricted sense of returning the biosphere to its status of a few hundred years ago (once again flourishing, with only the species loss of a hundred years of global industrialization), the Omega Project is oriented toward reestablishing \u201cheaven on earth.\u201d But it will still be Earth, not Heaven, and it will still contain challenges and conflict. The war against economics, which has jeopardized the planet and brought it to the brink of extinction, will continue. The things that Marx deplored about capitalism were inequality, exploitation and alienation, and he believed that world society would evolve to a state in which equality, freedom from exploitation, and true justice would prevail. Marx was not concerned with the destruction of the biosphere and extinction of humyn and other species. The Omega Project conceives a world that is long-term-sustainable, in which the humyn species can continue to exist for a very long time in the Garden-of-Eden biosphere in which it evolved. The Omega Project is concerned primarily with long-term survival (of humynkind and the biosphere), rather than with equality, exploitation of the worker, and \u201ctrue justice.\u201d The evils that Marx saw and fought were the evils produced by a world system founded on economics. The Omega Project directs its efforts toward a system of planetary management that does not involve economics \u2013 and hence does not create the evils that so bothered Marx. It is a system of planetary management similar to running a ship (in this case, Spaceship Earth). An economics-based system is used for a laissez-faire world of many nations and uncontrolled exploitation of nature. It was a phase of Earth\u2019s development that was an exciting, swashbuckling adventure, but it is soon to be finished.

The  rationale for the \u201coptimal population size\u201d is not at all clear. Why should there be  any attempt to maximize the size of the humyn population at all, when the humyn  population has been so destructive to the planet and other species and itself?  The optimal population approach has the appearance of a \u201cbribe,\u201d or perhaps an  \u201capologia\u201d \u2013 if humynkind would just agree to a smaller population size, then  everybody could have a high standard of living. This approach appeals to humyn\u2019s  greed, and that may enhance its chance of acceptance. But in the attempt to  maximize the humyn population at all, it continues to accept, indeed promote, a  substantial risk of destruction of other species and the humyn species. The risk  of species extinction (our own as well as other species) is reduced by  minimizing the level of humyn population and economic activity, not by  maximizing it! To survive, the humyn race is going to have to minimize its use of energy, not  maximize it.

What  is the purpose of having a hunter-gatherer society at all? Why not just have a  single industrialized population of five million, or other minimum sustainable size,  as in the \"minimum population\" approach. As mentioned earlier, the purpose of  the hunter-gatherer society is to increase the odds of long-term survival of the  humyn race. Any population that is very localized -- and a small industrial  population will be localized -- is in danger of extinction. In the case of a single  industrial population of five million, a few nuclear weapons or an asteroid could  easily extinguish the entire population. Having a hunter-gatherer population  distributed around the globe significantly promotes the likelihood that the humyn  race will survive this type of catastrophe. In other words, the hunter-gatherer population and the industrialized populations  need each other. They form a symbiotic relationship. The small, industrialized  population keeps the size of the hunter-gatherer population (and hence global  humyn population) in check; the hunter-gatherer population is insurance against  catastrophic destruction of all humynkind. The hunter-gatherer population also  provides the industrialized population with a raison d'\u00eatre. Preserving humynkind  and a Garden-of-Eden balance of nature on Earth may be a reasonable mission  or goal statement, but it is too general for use as an operational objective.  Maintaining a hunter-gatherer population in check is a specific, tangible objective  -- a reason for getting up each morning and going to work. Attributes of the Minimal-Regret Population Policy The primary objective in specifying the size of the industrial and hunter-gatherer populations is to minimize the amount of energy controlled by humynkind, and to let  nature do its job in maintaining a Garden-of-Eden balance.  This is totally the  opposite of the current approach of attempting to maximize the amount of energy 57 controlled by humynkind.  Instead of using 40-50% of the energy produced by  photosynthesis for humyn\u2019s exclusive purposes, the goal would be to utilize a  minimal amount, say 1% or less, for humyn\u2019s purposes.  Humynkind got into trouble  when its numbers and activity increased to the point at which it started making  measurable changes to the planet\u2019s environment.

Why not consider primitive agriculture (i.e., preindustrial, \u201corganic gardening\u201d agriculture without the use of industrial chemicals such as pesticides,  herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers)? The answer is twofold. First, primitive  agriculture lasted only 10,000 years, not hundreds of thousands of years, before  it evolved into industrial agriculture. There is, then, far less experiential evidence  that a global agricultural humyn society is sustainable. Second, agriculture has  been very destructive of other species. With the domestication of wild animals,  entire species were eliminated (e.g., the aurochs). Massive areas of forest were  cleared, resulting in the extermination of local species. Even primitive agriculture  is a sufficiently advanced mode of economic activity to enable massive  civilizations (e.g., the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans) to arise, with their  resultant plundering and destruction of nature. It is possible that humyn society could thrive in a sustainable fashion with  primitive agriculture; it is perhaps too soon to dismiss it as a feasible alternative.

They are, understandably, not the least bit interested in a world in which their culture and milieu for success is gone. Their attitude is not surprising. World history has seen again and again the failure of political, military, and social leaders to plan for world changes that eliminate the society (nation, culture, religion) of which they are in charge. If war comes and they are no longer in charge, so be it, but they have no interest at all in planning for a future in which they or their children have no place. Because of this universal attitude, however, implementation of a plan for world domination / planetary management in which there is no place for them will not be easy. They will reject any significant actions, or even plans, to set up a post-industrial world, because it is not their world.  Most people relate solely to the current social context in which they find themselves. When global war occurs, current world leaders will either be dead or discredited. This is a major factor explaining why current leaders have no interest in addressing the environmental and ecological problems facing the world.

It restores the planet\u2019s biosphere as close as possible to the  way it was prior to the massive changes brought about by agriculture and  industrialization. It reduces the likelihood of an industrially induced planetary disaster (e.g., greenhouse-gas disaster, biodiversity \u201cmeltdown\u201d) to a low, near preindustrial level. It raises the likelihood of humynkind\u2019s survival back to what it  has been for hundreds of thousands of years. It saves the planet for future generations. It bequeaths the same planet to each future generation. It rejects  the notion that this planet is the chattel of the current generation to destroy for all  time. It accomplishes all of these desirable outcomes. It restores to all other  species the freedom and ability to continue to exist. All that is denied to humynkind 58 is the freedom to propagate to the limit and to destroy all earthly species,  including itself. Many people do not realize how high the quality of life is in a hunting-gathering society. Robert Heilbroner discusses this in his book, Visions of the Future: The  Distant Past, Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow. Quoting economist Vernon  Smith, he observes that ever since Thomas Hobbes there has prevailed the  perception that life in hunting-gathering societies was (to quote Hobbes) \u201csolitary,  poor, nasty, brutish, and short,\u201d but that this perception is quite incorrect.  Hobbes\u2019 contention was that the desire for power leads to a state of nature where  life is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d Hunting-gathering life was, in  fact, relatively easy \u2013 hunter-gatherers were the original affluent society.  Although people did not have much in the way of material possessions, no one  was poor. Poverty is a social condition that was created by civilization. It is  desire for power, enabled by agriculture and industry, that leads to inhuman  inhumyn conditions, not natural life in a hunter-gatherer society. This is a very important point. Poverty and its associated humyn misery are  caused by civilization, by economic development, by industrial activity. Poverty  does not exist in a hunter-gatherer society. Humyn lives in balance with nature, and  there is good physical, mental, and emotional health. The UN, World Bank, and  other economic development organizations call incessantly for more economic  development. They have created a religion of development, playing on people\u2019s  fear and greed. They deceive and seduce, insisting that humyn welfare can be  improved only with increased economic development, empowerment, and  elimination of inequality. They cite all sorts of maxims and platitudes, such as  \u201cDevelopment that perpetuates today\u2019s inequalities is neither sustainable nor  worth sustaining,\u201d or \u201cShort-term advances in humyn development are possible \u2013 but they will not be sustainable without further growth. Conversely, economic  growth is not sustainable without humyn development,\u201d or \u201cHumyn development  and economic growth should move together, strongly linked\u201d (UN Humyn  Development Report 1966). Tell a big enough lie, and people will believe it.  Economic development is not the solution to humyn misery, it is the cause  of it. To eradicate poverty, it is necessary to get rid of economic and industrial  development. More development will inevitably lead to more poverty and humyn  misery. Humyn misery exists on a massive scale because industrial  development exists on a massive scale. To reduce the level of humyn misery, it  will be necessary to reduce the level of industrial development. The Economist (\u201cThe Sea: A Second Fall,\u201d May 23, 1998) seconds this  viewpoint. It equates the eviction of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden  with the end of hunter-gatherer society. It is agricultural and industrial society  that is harsh and brutal, not hunting-gathering society. God told Adam, \u201cCursed  is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of  your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of  the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the 59 ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and dust you will return.\u201d  The Economist observes that farming was the antithesis of nomadic life, with  rotten teeth and stunted bones replacing healthy bodies.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "id": "990585a6e9ad296124c1ae6514b52695ce3735c8768c8899e5d5132442756b74", "highlighted_text": "minimal-regret population puts a halt to industrial activity.

Is not all-out nuclear war just as self contradictory in the real world as pacifism is accused of being?

But for a civilization to sacrifice itself makes no sense since there are not survivors to give meaning to the sacrifical [sic] act. In that case, survival may be worth betrayal.\" Is it possible to avoid the \"moral calamity of a policy like unilateral disarmament that forces us to choose between being dead or red (while increasing the chances of both)\"?74 How one judges the issue of ends can be affected by how one poses the questions. If one asks \"what is worth a billion lives (or the survival of the species),\" it is natural to resist contemplating a positive answer. But suppose one asks, \"is it possible to imagine any threat to our civilization and values that would justify raising the threat to a billion lives from one in ten thousand to one in a thousand for a specific period?\" Then there are several plausible answers, including a democratic way of life and cherished freedoms that give meaning to life beyond mere survival. When we pursue several values simultaneously, we face the fact that they often conflict and that we face difficult tradeoffs. If we make one value absolute in priority, we are likely to get that value and little else. Survival is a necessary condition for the enjoyment of other values, but that does not make it sufficient. Logical priority does not make it an absolute value. Few people act as though survival were an absolute value in their personal lives, or they would never enter an automobile. We can give survival of the species a very high priority without giving it the paralyzing status of an absolute value. Some degree of risk is unavoidable if individuals or societies are to avoid paralysis and enhance the quality of life beyond mere survival. The degree of that risk is a justifiable topic of both prudential and moral reasoning.

It is a lifestyle that is, overall, exciting, meaningful, pleasant, comfortable, and leisurely. It has been estimated that hunter-gatherer societies can and do provide for all of their needs with about two days\u2019 work per week. The remainder of the time is available for a variety of discretionary social and cultural activities, such as socializing, exploration, discovery, and arts and crafts.  At the same time, the life of the members of the single-nation city-state (the planetary management organization) is also, overall, comfortable, meaningful, and fulfilling. From the viewpoint of the activities of daily living, however, the two lifestyles are radically different. It has been said that the major \u201cpaths to God\u201d (paths to spiritual realization and development) are love, knowledge and action. Not all people take the same paths, at the same time. To make life interesting, it is necessary that people and societies are different, and do different things. The greater the level of diversity, the greater the level of interest. Both populations of the minimal-regret scheme are engaged in meaningful and interesting activities. Those activities are, however, very different.  In the synarchic minimal-regret population, there is no global poverty and no global war. There is no global disease: the risk of a planetary epidemic is minimized, because the planetary hunter-gatherer population consists, as in the past, of independent and isolated tribes that intermingle to a very limited degree. There is no global famine.

Although any debate has the potential to create problems for the community (videotapes of objectionable behavior, etc\u2026), rarely does any one debate have the power to create community wide change. We attribute this ineffectiveness to the structural problems inherent in individual debates and the collective forgetfulness of the debate community. The structural problems are clear. Debaters engage in preliminary debates in rooms that are rarely populated by anyone other than the judge or a few scouts. Judges are instructed to vote for the team that does the best debating, but the ballot is rarely seen by anyone outside the tabulation room.  Given the limited number of debates in which a judge actually writes meaningful comments, there is little documentation available for use in many cases.  During the period when judges interact with the debaters there are often external pressures (filing evidence, preparing for the next debate, etc\u2026) that restrict the ability for anyone outside the debate to pay attention to why a judge voting a particular way. Elimination debates do not provide for a much better audience because debates still occur simultaneously and travel schedules dictate that most of the tournament has left by the later elimination rounds. We find it difficult for anyone to substantiate the claim that asking a judge to vote to solve a community problem in an individual debate with so few participants is the best strategy for addressing important problems. In addition to the structural problems, the collective forgetfulness of the debate community reduces the impact that individual debates have on the community. The debate community has a high turnover rate. Despite the fact that some debaters make their best effort to debate for more than four years, the debate community is largely made up of participants who debate and then move on. The coaches and directors that make up the backbone of the community are the people with the longest cultural memory, but they are also a small minority of the community when considering the number of debaters involved in the activity. We do not mean to suggest that the activity is reinvented every year\u2014certainly there are conventions that are passed down from coaches to debaters and from debaters to debaters. However, given the fact that there are virtually no transcriptions available for everyone to read, it is difficult to assume that the debate community would remember any individual debate. Additionally, given the focus on competition and individual skill, the community is more likely to remember the accomplishments and talents of debaters rather than what argument they won a particular round on. The debate community does not have the necessary components in place for a strong collective memory of individual debates. We believe that the combination of the structures of debate and the collective forgetfulness means that any strategy for creating community change that is premised on winning individual debates is less effective than seeking a larger community dialogue that is recorded and/or transcribed. \tThe second major problem with attempting to create community change in individual debates is that the debate community is made up of more individuals than the four debaters and one judge that are a part of every debate. The coaches and directors that make up the backbone of the community have very little space for engaging in a discussion about community issues. We suspect that this helps explain why so few debaters get involved in the edebates over activist strategies. Coaches and directors dominant this forum because there is so little public dialogue over the issues that directly affect the community that they have dedicated so much of their professional and personal lives. This is especially true for coaches and directors that are not preferred judges and therefore do not even have a voice at the end of a debate. Coaches and directors should have a public forum to engage in a community conversation with debaters instead of attempting to take on their opponents through the wins and losses of their own debaters."], "id": "e10d65e297cb83cd2dcc954480934748b070e6c97b37f7982423b871c63bf063", "highlighted_text": "rarely does any one debate to create community wide change.

The current  wanton destruction of Earth by humynkind is viewed as a morally repugnant action  of grotesque proportions. Humynkind has been given dominion over the planet, and  in his venal prodigality has chosen to squander its bounty and destroy its  irreplaceable biological diversity.

If the humyn race is made extinct by the greenhouse effect, millions of people will  have been denied life for every year of the next four billion years that the solar  system is expected to last.

If we make one value absolute in priority, we are likely to get that value and little else. Survival is a necessary condition for the enjoyment of other values, but that does not make it sufficient. Logical priority does not make it an absolute value. Few people act as though survival were an absolute value in their personal lives, or they would never enter an automobile. We can give survival of the species a very high priority without giving it the paralyzing status of an absolute value.

Given all this, the risks of escalation\u2014which Western leaders were rightly wont to  emphasize in the interests of deterrence\u2014are grave. But this is not to say that they are virtually certain,  or even necessarily odds-on; still less that they are so for all the assorted circumstances in which the  situation might arise, in a nuclear world to which past experience is only a limited guide. It is entirely  possible, for example, that the initial use of nuclear weapons, breaching a barrier that has held since 1945,  might so appall both sides in a conflict that they recognized an overwhelming common interest in  composing their differences. The humyn pressures in that direction would be very great.  Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, the supposition of inexorable momentum in a  developing exchange, with each side rushing to overreaction amid confusion and uncertainty, is  implausible; it fails to consider what the decision-makers' situation would really be.

Life will continue after a nuclear  attack. This situation will occur, and it must be dealt with. It may be dealt with in  an unprepared, unplanned way, or it may be approached with a plan. With a  plan, the odds of prevailing are much better. The situation is analogous to designing an ocean liner. No one wants the liner to  hit an iceberg \u2013 that is a horrible catastrophe. There are, however, two ways of  approaching this possibility. The issue may be ignored, and all hands will go  down with the ship unless another ship is nearby for rescue. Or, the liner may be  equipped with lifeboats and an evacuation plan. In the case of the Titanic, for  example, it has been observed that if, after striking the iceberg the liner had  stopped, it may have been possible to place many people on the iceberg, and  thereby save them. But the Titanic continued to sail into open ocean, and sank  twelve miles from the iceberg. The Titanic had few lifeboats and no plan, and  much life was lost. The present approach of the United States government of simply ignoring the  possibility of strategic nuclear war, abandoning its population and letting it deal  with the postattack situation as best it can is unconscionable. With respect to a  nuclear attack on the US, the US government is an ostrich with its head in the  sand. It is a prime manifestation of the country\u2019s complete lack of a sense of  purpose or destiny. It has lost its bearings. It does not know what its purpose is  or where it is headed. It lives only for the present, in a mindless, purposeless,  hedonistic frenzy of economic development. It chooses to invest its energies in gluttony, gorging itself on energy, expanding its population to the max regardless  of the consequences for itself or the planet, rather than in planning for or  preparing for the future. Other nations, such as the Swiss, have made at least  some attempt to deal with this problem. Those who plan for the future may still  die, but they can certainly increase their chance of survival. It is prudent to do  so. It is responsible to do so. As much as the US government and many environmentalist movements would  lead you to believe, nuclear war will not be the end of the world. On the contrary,  it may well be the salvation of the world. The will to survive is indomitable in the  humyn spirit, and the survivors will fight to live. After a nuclear war humynkind will  simply \u201cpick up the pieces\u201d and start to rebuild industrial civilization all over again.  As in previous history, it is likely that economics would continue to be the \u201cdriver\u201d  of humyn\u2019s progress. If this happens, nothing changes, and the world will simply  repeat its present history and race to Armageddon. A minimal-regret strategy offers a possible way to break out of this cycle, to do things differently in the  future.

It would kill everyone. (This is the demoralizing message of On the Beach and many similar pseudoscientific books and articles.) \u00b0 Facts: When a nuclear weapon explodes near enough to the ground for its fireball to touch the ground, it forms a crater. (See Fig. 1.1.) Many thousands of tons of earth from the crater of a large explosion are pulverized into trillions of particles. These particles are contaminated by radioactive atoms produced by the nuclear explosion. Thousands of tons of the particles are carried up into a mushroom-shaped cloud, miles above the earth. These radioactive particles then fall out of the mushroom cloud, or out of the dispersing cloud of particles blown by the winds thus becoming fallout. Each contaminated particle continuously gives off invisible radiation, much like a tiny X-ray machine while in the mushroom cloud, while descending, and after having fallen to earth. The descending radioactive particles are carried by the winds like the sand and dust particles of a miles-thick sandstorm cloud except that they usually are blown at lower speeds and in many areas the particles are so far apart that no cloud is seen. The largest, heaviest fallout particles reach the ground first, in locations close to the explosion. Many smaller particles are carried by the winds for tens to thousands of miles before falling to earth. At any one place where fallout from a single explosion is being deposited on the ground in concentrations high enough to require the use of shelters, deposition will be completed within a few hours. The smallest fallout particles those tiny enough to be inhaled into a person's lungs are invisible to the naked eye. These tiny particles would fall so slowly from the four-mile or greater heights to which they would be injected by currently deployed Soviet warheads that most would remain airborne for weeks to years before reaching the ground. By that time their extremely wide dispersal and radioactive decay would make them much less dangerous. Only where such tiny particles are promptly brought to earth by rain- outs or snow-outs in scattered \"hot spots,\" and later dried and blown about by the winds, would these invisible particles constitute a long-term and relatively minor post-attack danger. The air in properly designed fallout shelters, even those without air filters, is free of radioactive particles and safe to breathe except in a few' rare environments as will be explained later. Fortunately for all living things, the danger from fallout radiation lessens with time. The radioactive decay, as this lessening is called, is rapid at first, then gets slower and slower. The dose rate (the amount of radiation received per hour) decreases accordingly. Figure 1.2 illustrates the rapidity of the decay of radiation from fallout during the first two days after the nuclear explosion that produced it. R stands or roentgen, a measurement unit often used to measure exposure to gamma rays and X rays. Fallout meterfs called dosimeters measure the dose received by recording the number of R. Fallout meters called survey meters, or dose-rate meters, measure the dose rate by recording the number of R being received per hour at the time of measurement. Notice that it takes about seven times as long for the dose rate to decay from 1000 roentgens per hour (1000 R/hr) to 10 R/hr (48 hours) as to decay from 1000 R/hr to 100 R/hr (7 hours).

McElroy said that nuclear winter researchers \u201cstacked the deck\u201d in their study, which was titled \u201cNuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions\u201d (Science, December 1983). Nuclear winter is the theory that the mass use of nuclear weapons would create enough smoke and dust to blot out the sun, causing a catastrophic drop in global temperatures. According to Carl Sagan, in this situation the earth would freeze. No crops could be grown. Humynity would die of cold and starvation. In truth, natural disasters have frequently produced smoke and dust far greater than those expected from a nuclear war. In 1883 Krakatoa exploded with a blast equivalent to 10,000 one-megaton bombs, a detonation greater than the combined nuclear arsenals of planet earth. The Krakatoa explosion had negligible weather effects. Even more disastrous, going back many thousands of years, a meteor struck Quebec with the force of 17.5 million one-megaton bombs, creating a crater 63 kilometers in diameter. But the world did not freeze. Life on earth was not extinguished. Consider the views of Professor George Rathjens of MIT, a known antinuclear activist, who said, \u201cNuclear winter is the worst example of misrepresentation of science to the public in my memory.\u201d Also consider Professor Russell Seitz, at Harvard University\u2019s Center for International Affairs, who says that the nuclear winter hypothesis has been discredited. Two researchers, Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider, debunked the nuclear winter hypothesis in the summer 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs. Thompson and Schneider stated: \u201cthe global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishingly low level of probability.\u201d OK, so nuclear winter isn\u2019t going to happen. What about nuclear fallout? Wouldn\u2019t the radiation from a nuclear war contaminate the whole earth, killing everyone? The short answer is: absolutely not.

Both are utilizing (receiving the benefit of) about the same amount of (solar) energy. Most of this energy is used the same way, i.e., to maintain the biosphere, but in the high-technology society a small fraction is used in a very different way: it is converted to manufacture (controllable) energy for technological purposes. The hunter-gatherer can take food and other products from an exquisite variety and bounty of plants and animals with a minimal expenditure of effort and can enjoy an endless variety of spectacular vistas every day. The hunter-gatherer works two days out of seven, whereas the high-technology urban dweller typically works five days out of seven (whether by choice or necessity). While the quality of life may be high for both the high-technology urban dweller and the hunter-gatherer, it is a radically different lifestyle. Both have the wherewithal to enjoy a meaningful and interesting and exciting existence, but the contexts in which that takes place are very different. From the viewpoint of \u201cpaths to God,\u201d the hunter-gatherer\u2019s lifestyle is dominated by action (hunting, fishing, socializing, adventure, local conflict), whereas the high-technology person\u2019s lifestyle is dominated by knowledge. In today\u2019s terminology, the high-technology society is a \u201cknowledge society.\u201d  My friend\u2019s gut reaction was that the hunter-gatherer was \u201cgetting the short end of the stick,\u201d in the minimal-regret population paradigm. That is not at all the case. Both share the planet\u2019s solar energy flux equally. The members of both components of the minimal-regret population have freedoms and they have restrictions. They both have challenges, and they both have requirements and obligations. Their activities are very different. Some people would prefer the life of a hunter-gatherer to that of a member of the planetary management organization. It is very clear that most urban dwellers on the planet today, living in misery, squalor, oppression and deprivation, would choose either the lifestyle of the hunter-gatherer society (with 25 square kilometres of natural living space per person) or the lifestyle of a member of the single-nation city-state planetary management organization as preferable to his present existence.  That more people would choose one lifestyle to the other is not at all clear. The preference depends on personality, values and abilities (i.e., their location on their \u201cpath to God\u201d). The hunter-gatherer is in fact much \u201cwealthier\u201d than the city-state dweller, in terms of freedom to roam and leisure time (i.e., in terms of freedom in space and time). The challenges in his life may be viewed by some as less complex, or less \u201ccivilized,\u201d and therefore less interesting and meaningful than those of the city-state dweller, but this is arguable, since it depends very much on the personality and stage of development of the individual. The member of the planetary management organization has an assigned mission (viz., a role in the planetary management organization), but so too does the member of the hunter-gatherer society (viz., his role in the tribe). Both have opportunities for spiritual development, but their life takes place in very different vocational contexts. The high-technology person is involved in management, science, engineering, and all of the other fields of endeavor of technological society.

This representation is totally false.  As I, and many others, have observed, the life of hunter-gatherers is nothing of the sort imagined by Hobbes. It is a lifestyle that is, overall, exciting, meaningful, pleasant, comfortable, and leisurely. It has been estimated that hunter-gatherer societies can and do provide for all of their needs with about two days\u2019 work per week. The remainder of the time is available for a variety of discretionary social and cultural activities, such as socializing, exploration, discovery, and arts and crafts.  At the same time, the life of the members of the single-nation city-state (the planetary management organization) is also, overall, comfortable, meaningful, and fulfilling. From the viewpoint of the activities of daily living, however, the two lifestyles are radically different. It has been said that the major \u201cpaths to God\u201d (paths to spiritual realization and development) are love, knowledge and action. Not all people take the same paths, at the same time. To make life interesting, it is necessary that people and societies are different, and do different things. The greater the level of diversity, the greater the level of interest. Both populations of the minimal-regret scheme are engaged in meaningful and interesting activities. Those activities are, however, very different.  In the synarchic minimal-regret population, there is no global poverty and no global war. There is no global disease: the risk of a planetary epidemic is minimized, because the planetary hunter-gatherer population consists, as in the past, of independent and isolated tribes that intermingle to a very limited degree.

", "", "Climate change is emerging while the wild is stressed by other pressures\u2014 habitat loss, overhunting, pollution, and invasive species\u2014and it will magnify these stresses. Species will respond to warming at differing paces, affecting many others through the web of ecological interactions. Phenological events, which are timed events in the life cycle that are usually tied to seasons, may be disrupted. Examples of phenological events include when leaves and flowers emerge and when animals depart for migration, breed, or hibernate. If species depend on each other during those times\u2014for pollination or food\u2014 the pace at which they respond to warmer weather or precipitation changes may cause unraveling, cascading effects within ecosystems. Animals and plants respond to climate changes by expanding, contracting, or shifting their ranges. Isotherms, lines of a specific average temperature, are moving poleward by approximately thirty-five miles (56 km) per decade, meaning many species ranges may in turn shift at that pace.4 Some already are: the red fox is moving into Arctic fox territory, and ecologists have observed that 943 species across all taxa and ecosystems have exhibited measurable changes in their phenologies and/or distribution over the past several decades.5 However, their potential routes and habitat will be limited by geographic or humyn-made obstacles, and other species\u2019 territories. Continued business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions threaten many ecosystems, which together form the fabric of life on Earth and provide a wide range of services to humynity. Some species face extinction. The following examples represent a handful. Of particular concern are polar species, because they are being pushed off the planet. In Antarctica, Adelie and emperor penguins are in decline, as shrinking sea ice has reduced the abundance of krill, their food source.6 Arctic polar bears already contend with melting sea ice, from which they hunt seals in colder months. As sea ice recedes earlier each year, populations of polar bears in Canada have declined by about 20 percent, with the weight of females and the number of surviving cubs decreasing a similar amount. As of this writing, the US Fish and Wildlife Service is still considering protecting polar bears, but only after it was taken to court for failure to act on the mounting evidence that polar bears will suffer greatly due to global warming. 7 Life in many biologically diverse alpine regions is similarly in danger of being pushed off the planet. When a given temperature range moves up a mountain, the area with those climatic conditions becomes smaller and rockier, and the air thinner, resulting in a struggle for survival for some alpine species. In the Southwest US, the endemic Mount Graham red squirrel survives on a single Arizona mountain, an \u201cisland in the sky,\u201d an isolated green spot in the desert. The squirrels, protected as an endangered species, had rebounded to a population of over 500, but their numbers have since declined to between 100 and 200 animals.8 Loss of the red squirrel will alter the forest because its middens are a source of food and habitat for chipmunks, voles, and mice. A new stress on Graham red squirrels is climatic: increased heat, drought, and fires. Heat-stressed forests are vulnerable to prolonged beetle infestation and catastrophic fires. Rainfall still occurs, but it is erratic and heavy, and dry periods are more intense. The resulting forest fires burn hotter, and the lower reaches of the forest cannot recover. In the marine world, loggerhead turtles are also suffering. These great creatures return to beaches every two to three years to bury a clutch of eggs. Hatchlings emerge after two months and head precariously to the sea to face a myriad of predators. Years of conservation efforts to protect loggerhead turtles on their largest nesting area in the US, stretching over 20 miles of Florida coastline, seemed to be stabilizing the South Florida subpopulation. 9 Now climate change places a new stress on these turtles. Florida beaches are increasingly lined with sea walls to protect against rising seas and storms. Sandy beaches seaward of the walls are limited and may be lost if the sea level rises substantially. Some creatures seem more adaptable to climate change. The armadillo, a prehistoric critter that has been around for over 50 million years, is likely to extend its range northward in the US. But the underlying cause of the climatic threat to the Graham red squirrel and other species\u2014from grizzlies, whose springtime food sources may shift, to the isolated snow vole in the mountains of southern Spain\u2014is \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d use of fossil fuels. Predicted warming of several degrees Celsius would surely cause mass extinctions. Prior major warmings in Earth\u2019s history, the most recent occurring 55 million years ago with the release of large amounts of Arctic methane hydrates,10 resulted in the extinction of half or more of the species then on the planet. Might the Graham red squirrel and snow vole be \u201csaved\u201d if we transplant them to higher mountains? They would have to compete for new niches\u2014 and there is a tangled web of interactions that has evolved among species and ecosystems.

In a major London address, British Defense Secretary John Reid warned that global climate change and dwindling natural resources are combining to increase the likelihood of violent conflict over land, water and energy. Climate change, he indicated, \"will make scarce resources, clean water, viable agricultural land even scarcer\" -- and this will \"make the emergence of violent conflict more rather than less likely.\"\u00a0Although not unprecedented, Reid's prediction of an upsurge in resource conflict is significant both because of his senior rank and the vehemence of his remarks. \"The blunt truth is that the lack of water and agricultural land is a significant contributory factor to the tragic conflict we see unfolding in Darfur,\" he declared. \"We should see this as a warning sign.\"\u00a0Resource conflicts of this type are most likely to arise in the developing world, Reid indicated, but the more advanced and affluent countries are not likely to be spared the damaging and destabilizing effects of global climate change. With sea levels rising, water and energy becoming increasingly scarce and prime agricultural lands turning into deserts, internecine warfare over access to vital resources will become a global phenomenon.\u00a0Reid's speech, delivered at the prestigious Chatham House in London (Britain's equivalent of the Council on Foreign Relations), is but the most recent expression of a growing trend in strategic circles to view environmental and resource effects -- rather than political orientation and ideology -- as the most potent source of armed conflict in the decades to come. With the world population rising, global consumption rates soaring, energy supplies rapidly disappearing and climate change eradicating valuable farmland, the stage is being set for persistent and worldwide struggles over vital resources. Religious and political strife will not disappear in this scenario, but rather will be channeled into contests over valuable sources of water, food and energy.\u00a0Prior to Reid's address, the most significant expression of this outlook was a report prepared for the U.S. Department of Defense by a California-based consulting firm in October 2003. Entitled \"An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security,\" the report warned that global climate change is more likely to result in sudden, cataclysmic environmental events than a gradual (and therefore manageable) rise in average temperatures. Such events could include a substantial increase in global sea levels, intense storms and hurricanes and continent-wide \"dust bowl\" effects. This would trigger pitched battles between the survivors of these effects for access to food, water, habitable land and energy supplies.\"Violence and disruption stemming from the stresses created by abrupt changes in the climate pose a different type of threat to national security than we are accustomed to today,\" the 2003 report noted. \"Military confrontation may be triggered by a desperate need for natural resources such as energy, food and water rather than by conflicts over ideology, religion or national honor.\"\u00a0Until now, this mode of analysis has failed to command the attention of top American and British policymakers. For the most part, they insist that ideological and religious differences -- notably, the clash between values of tolerance and democracy on one hand and extremist forms of Islam on the other -- remain the main drivers of international conflict. But Reid's speech at Chatham House suggests that a major shift in strategic thinking may be under way. Environmental perils may soon dominate the world security agenda.\u00a0This shift is due in part to the growing weight of evidence pointing to a significant humyn role in altering the planet's basic climate systems. Recent studies showing the rapid shrinkage of the polar ice caps, the accelerated melting of North American glaciers, the increased frequency of severe hurricanes and a number of other such effects all suggest that dramatic and potentially harmful changes to the global climate have begun to occur. More importantly, they conclude that humyn behavior -- most importantly, the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power plants, and motor vehicles -- is the most likely cause of these changes. This assessment may not have yet penetrated the White House and other bastions of head-in-the-sand thinking, but it is clearly gaining ground among scientists and thoughtful analysts around the world.\u00a0For the most part, public discussion of global climate change has tended to describe its effects as an environmental problem -- as a threat to safe water, arable soil, temperate forests, certain species and so on. And, of course, climate change is a potent threat to the environment; in fact, the greatest threat imaginable. But viewing climate change as an environmental problem fails to do justice to the magnitude of the peril it poses. As Reid's speech and the 2003 Pentagon study make clear, the greatest danger posed by global climate change is not the degradation of ecosystems per se, but rather the disintegration of entire humyn societies, producing wholesale starvation, mass migrations and recurring conflict over resources.\u00a0\"As famine, disease, and weather-related disasters strike due to abrupt climate change,\" the Pentagon report notes, \"many countries' needs will exceed their carrying capacity\" -- that is, their ability to provide the minimum requirements for humyn survival. This \"will create a sense of desperation, which is likely to lead to offensive aggression\" against countries with a greater stock of vital resources. \"Imagine eastern European countries, struggling to feed their populations with a falling supply of food, water, and energy, eyeing Russia, whose population is already in decline, for access to its grain, minerals, and energy supply.\"\u00a0Similar scenarios will be replicated all across the planet, as those without the means to survival invade or migrate to those with greater abundance -- producing endless struggles between resource \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\"\u00a0It is this prospect, more than anything, that worries John Reid. In particular, he expressed concern over the inadequate capacity of poor and unstable countries to cope with the effects of climate change, and the resulting risk of state collapse, civil war and mass migration. \"More than 300 million people in Africa currently lack access to safe water,\" he observed, and \"climate change will worsen this dire situation\" -- provoking more wars like Darfur. And even if these social disasters will occur primarily in the developing world, the wealthier countries will also be caught up in them, whether by participating in peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations, by fending off unwanted migrants or by fighting for access to overseas supplies of food, oil, and minerals.\u00a0When reading of these nightmarish scenarios, it is easy to conjure up images of desperate, starving people killing one another with knives, staves and clubs -- as was certainly often the case in the past, and could easily prove to be so again. But these scenarios also envision the use of more deadly weapons. \"In this world of warring states,\" the 2003 Pentagon report predicted, \"nuclear arms proliferation is inevitable.\" As oil and natural gas disappears, more and more countries will rely on nuclear power to meet their energy needs -- and this \"will accelerate nuclear proliferation as countries develop enrichment and reprocessing capabilities to ensure their national security.\"\u00a0Although speculative, these reports make one thing clear: when thinking about the calamitous effects of global climate change, we must emphasize its social and political consequences as much as its purely environmental effects. Drought, flooding and storms can kill us, and surely will -- but so will wars among the survivors of these catastrophes over what remains of food, water and shelter. As Reid's comments indicate, no society, however affluent, will escape involvement in these forms of conflict.\u00a0", ""], "id": "d4640e5477dc34b1e56de0a2943fb653360f4ab5cd64daabe79b47130603fd83", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[4, 0, 50], [4, 79, 104], [4, 110, 241], [4, 269, 285], [4, 302, 328], [4, 368, 443], [4, 461, 468], [4, 633, 736], [4, 777, 785], [4, 1885, 1920], [4, 1964, 2044], [4, 2356, 2461], [4, 2519, 2716], [4, 2797, 2805], [4, 2806, 2967], [4, 3182, 3192], [4, 3313, 3366], [4, 3488, 3537], [4, 3642, 3793], [4, 3794, 3799], [4, 3800, 3843], [4, 5285, 5370], [4, 5400, 5458], [4, 5542, 5894], [4, 5926, 5984], [4, 6078, 6145], [4, 6228, 6422], [4, 7172, 7348], [4, 7384, 7610], [4, 7633, 7880], [4, 7900, 8003], [4, 8032, 8045], [4, 8064, 8115]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 55]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark_II.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2006-01-01"}, {"tag": "A2: GW nonexistent", "cite": "1.

This can be broken into two parts. The first is as follows: global climate is warming. This is by now a generally undisputed point (except by novelist Michael Crichton), so we deal with it only briefly. The two leading compilations of data measured with thermometers are shown in figure 3-3, that of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and that of the British Hadley Centre for Climate Change. Although they differ in the details, due to the inclusion of different data sets and use of different spatial averaging and quality control procedures, they both show a consistent picture, with a global mean warming of 0.8\u00b0C since the late nineteenth century. Temperatures over the past ten years clearly were the warmest since measured records have been available. The year 1998 sticks out well above the longterm trend due to the occurrence of a major El Nino event that year (the last El Nino so far and one of the strongest on record). These events are examples of the largest natural climate variations on multiyear time scales and, by releasing heat from the ocean, generally cause positive anomalies in global mean temperature. It is remarkable that the year 2005 rivaled the heat of 1998 even though no El Nino event occurred that year. (A bizarre curiosity, perhaps worth mentioning, is that several prominent \"climate skeptics\" recently used the extreme year 1998 to claim in the media that global warming had ended. In Lindzen's words, \"Indeed, the absence of any record breakers during the past seven years is statistical evidence that temperatures are not increasing.\")33 In addition to the surface measurements, the more recent portion of the global warming trend (since 1979) is also documented by satellite data. It is not straightforward to derive a reliable surface temperature trend from satellites, as they measure radiation coming from throughout the atmosphere (not just near the surface), including the stratosphere, which has strongly cooled, and the records are not homogeneous' due to the short life span of individual satellites, the problem of orbital decay, observations at different times of day, and drifts in instrument calibration.' Current analyses of these satellite data show trends that are fully consistent with surface measurements and model simulations.\" If no reliable temperature measurements existed, could we be sure that the climate is warming? The \"canaries in the coal mine\" of climate change (as glaciologist Lonnie Thompson puts it) ~are mountain glaciers. We know, both from old photographs and from the position of the terminal moraines heaped up by the flowing ice, that mountain glaciers have been in retreat all over the world during the past century. There are precious few exceptions, and they are associated with a strong increase in precipitation or local cooling.36 I have inspected examples of shrinking glaciers myself in field trips to Switzerland, Norway, and New Zealand. As glaciers respond sensitively to temperature changes, data on the extent of glaciers have been used to reconstruct a history of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past four centuries (see figure 3-4). Cores drilled in tropical glaciers show signs of recent melting that is unprecedented at least throughout the Holocene-the past 10,000 years. Another powerful sign of warming, visible clearly from satellites, is the shrinking Arctic sea ice cover (figure 3-5), which has declined 20 percent since satellite observations began in 1979. While climate clearly became warmer in the twentieth century, much discussion particularly in the popular media has focused on the question of how \"unusual\" this warming is in a longer-term context. While this is an interesting question, it has often been mixed incorrectly with the question of causation. Scientifically, how unusual recent warming is-say, compared to the past millennium-in itself contains little information about its cause. Even a highly unusual warming could have a natural cause (for example, an exceptional increase in solar activity). And even a warming within the bounds of past natural variations could have a predominantly anthropogenic cause. I come to the question of causation shortly, after briefly visiting the evidence for past natural climate variations. Records from the time before systematic temperature measurements were collected are based on \"proxy data,\" coming from tree rings, ice cores, corals, and other sources. These proxy data are generally linked to local temperatures in some way, but they may be influenced by other parameters as well (for example, precipitation), they may have a seasonal bias (for example, the growth season for tree rings), and high-quality long records are difficult to obtain and therefore few in number and geographic coverage. Therefore, there is still substantial uncertainty in the evolution of past global or hemispheric temperatures. (Comparing only local or regional temperature; as in Europe, is of limited value for our purposes,' as regional variations can be much larger than global ones and can have many regional causes, unrelated to global-scale forcing and climate change.) The first quantitative reconstruction for the Northern Hemisphere temperature of the past millennium, including an error estimation, was presented by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes and rightly highlighted in the 2001 IPCC report as one of the major new findings since its 1995 report; it is shown in figure 3_6.39 The analysis suggests that, despite the large error bars, twentieth-century warming is indeed highly unusual and probably was unprecedented during the past millennium. This result, presumably because of its symbolic power, has attracted much criticism, to some extent in scientific journals, but even more so in the popular media. The hockey stick-shaped curve became a symbol for the IPCC, .and criticizing this particular data analysis became an avenue for some to question the credibility of the IPCC. Three important things have been overlooked in much of the media coverage. First, even if the scientific critics had been right, this would not have called into question the very cautious conclusion drawn by the IPCC from the reconstruction by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes: \"New analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere indicate that the increase in temperature in the twentieth century is likely to have been the largest of any century during the past 1,000 years.\" This conclusion has since been supported further by every single one of close to a dozen new reconstructions (two of which are shown in figure 3-6).Second, by far the most serious scientific criticism raised against Mann, Hughes, and Bradley was simply based on a mistake. 40 The prominent paper of von Storch and others, which claimed (based on a model test) that the method of Mann, Bradley, and Hughes systematically underestimated variability, \"was [itself] based on incorrect implementation of the reconstruction procedure.\"41 With correct implementation, climate field reconstruction procedures such as the one used by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes have been shown to perform well in similar model tests. Third, whether their reconstruction is accurate or not has no bearing on policy. If their analysis underestimated past natural climate variability, this would certainly not argue for a smaller climate sensitivity and thus a lesser concern about the consequences of our emissions. Some have argued that, in contrast, it would point to a larger climate sensitivity. While this is a valid point in principle, it does not apply in practice to the climate sensitivity estimates discussed herein or to the range given by IPCC, since these did not use the reconstruction of Mann, Hughes, and Bradley or any other proxy records of the past millennium. Media claims that \"a pillar of the Kyoto Protocol\" had been called into question were therefore misinformed. As an aside, the protocol was agreed in 1997, before the reconstruction in question even existed. The overheated public debate on this topic has, at least, helped to attract more researchers and funding to this area of paleoclimatology; its methodology has advanced significantly, and a number of new reconstructions have been presented in recent years. While the science has moved forward, the first seminal reconstruction by Mann, Hughes, and Bradley has held up remarkably well, with its main features reproduced by more recent work. Further progress probably will require substantial amounts of new proxy data, rather than further refinement of the statistical techniques pioneered by Mann, Hughes, and Bradley. Developing these data sets will require time and substantial effort. It is time to address the final statement: most of the observed warming over the past fifty years is anthropogenic. A large number of studies exist that have taken different approaches to analyze this issue, which is generally called the \"attribution problem.\" I do not discuss the exact share of the anthropogenic contribution (although this is an interesting question). By \"most\" I imply mean \"more than 50 percent.\u201dThe first and crucial piece of evidence is, of course, that the magnitude of the warming is what is expected from the anthropogenic perturbation of the radiation balance, so anthropogenic forcing is able to explain all of the temperature rise. As discussed here, the rise in greenhouse gases alone corresponds to 2.6 W/tn2 of forcing. This by itself, after subtraction of the observed 0'.6 W/m2 of ocean heat uptake, would Cause 1.6\u00b0C of warming since preindustrial times for medium climate sensitivity (3\"C). With a current \"best guess'; aerosol forcing of 1 W/m2, the expected warming is O.8\u00b0c. The point here is not that it is possible to obtain the 'exact observed number-this is fortuitous because the amount of aerosol' forcing is still very' uncertain-but that the expected magnitude is roughly right.   There can be little doubt that the anthropogenic forcing is large enough to explain most of the warming. Depending on aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity, it could explain a large fraction of the warming, or all of it, or even more warming than has been observed (leaving room for natural processes to counteract some of the warming). The second important piece of evidence is clear: there is no viable alternative explanation. In the scientific literature, no serious alternative hypothesis has been proposed to explain the observed global warming. Other possible causes, such as solar activity, volcanic activity, cosmic rays, or orbital cycles, are well observed, but they do not show trends capable of explaining the observed warming. Since 1978, solar irradiance has been measured directly from satellites and shows the well-known eleven-year solar cycle, but no trend. There are various estimates of solar variability before this time, based on sunspot numbers, solar cycle length, the geomagnetic AA index, neutron monitor data, and, carbon-14 data. These indicate that solar activity probably increased somewhat up to 1940. While there is disagreement about the variation in previous centuries, different authors agree that solar activity did not significantly increase during the last sixty-five years. Therefore, this cannot explain the warming, and neither can any of the other factors mentioned. Models driven by natural factors only, leaving the anthropogenic forcing aside, show a cooling in the second half of the twentieth century (for an example, See figure 2-2, panel a, in chapter 2 of this volume). The trend in the sum of natural forcings is downward.The only way out would be either some as yet undiscovered unknown forcing or a warming trend that arises by chance from an unforced internal variability in the climate system. The latter cannot be completely ruled out, but has to be considered highly unlikely. No evidence in the observed record, proxy data, or current models suggest that such internal variability could cause a sustained trend of global warming of the observed magnitude. As discussed, twentieth century warming is unprecedented over the past 1,000 years (or even 2,000 years, as the few longer reconstructions available now suggest), which does not 'support the idea of large internal fluctuations. Also, those past variations correlate well with past forcing (solar variability, volcanic activity) and thus appear to be largely forced rather than due to unforced internal variability.\" And indeed, it would be difficult for a large and sustained unforced variability to satisfy the fundamental physical law of energy conservation. Natural internal variability generally shifts heat around different parts of the climate system-for example, the large El Nino event of 1998, which warmed, the atmosphere by releasing heat stored in the ocean. This mechanism implies that the ocean heat content drops as the atmosphere warms. For past decades, as discussed, we observed the atmosphere warming and the ocean heat content increasing, which rules out heat release from the ocean as a cause of surface warming. The heat content of the whole climate system is increasing, and there is no plausible source of this heat other than the heat trapped by greenhouse gases. ' A completely different approach to attribution is to analyze the spatial patterns of climate change. This is done in so-called fingerprint studies, which associate particular patterns or \"fingerprints\" with different forcings. It is plausible that the pattern of a solar-forced climate change differs from the pattern of a change caused by greenhouse gases. For example, a characteristic of greenhouse gases is that heat is trapped closer to the Earth's surface and that, unlike solar variability, greenhouse gases tend to warm more in winter, and at night. Such studies have used different data sets and have been performed by different groups of researchers with different statistical methods. They consistently conclude that the observed spatial pattern of warming can only be explained by greenhouse gases.49 Overall, it has to be considered, highly likely' that the observed warming is indeed predominantly due to the humyn-caused increase in greenhouse gases. ' This paper discussed the evidence for the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the effect of CO2 on climate, finding that this anthropogenic increase is proven beyond reasonable doubt and that a mass of evidence points to a CO2 effect on climate of 3C \u00b1 1.59C global-warming for a doubling of concentration. (This is, the classic IPCC range; my personal assessment is that, in-the light of new studies since the IPCC Third Assessment Report, the uncertainty range can now be narrowed somewhat to 3\u00b0C \u00b1 1.0C) This is based on consistent results from theory, models, and data analysis, and, even in the absence-of any computer models, the same result would still hold based on physics and on data from climate history alone. Considering the plethora of consistent evidence, the chance that these conclusions are wrong has to be considered minute.   If the preceding is accepted, then it follows logically and incontrovertibly that a further increase in CO2 concentration will lead to further warming. The magnitude of our emissions depends on humyn behavior, but the climatic response to various emissions scenarios can be computed from the information presented here. The result is the famous range of future global temperature scenarios shown in figure 3_6.50 Two additional steps are involved in these computations: the consideration of anthropogenic forcings other than CO2 (for example, other greenhouse gases and aerosols) and the computation of concentrations from the emissions. Other gases are not discussed here, although they are important to get quantitatively accurate results. CO2 is the largest and most important forcing. Concerning concentrations, the scenarios shown basically assume that ocean and biosphere take up a similar share of our emitted CO2 as in the past. This could turn out to be an optimistic assumption; some models indicate the possibility of a positive feedback, with the biosphere turning into a carbon source rather than a sink under growing climatic stress. It is clear that even in the more optimistic of the shown (non-mitigation) scenarios, global temperature would rise by 2-3\u00b0C above its preindustrial level by the end of this century. Even for a paleoclimatologist like myself, this is an extraordinarily high temperature, which is very likely unprecedented in at least the past 100,000 years. As far as the data show, we would have to go back about 3 million years, to the Pliocene, for comparable temperatures. The rate of this warming (which is important for the ability of ecosystems to cope) is also highly unusual and unprecedented probably for an even longer time. The last major global warming trend occurred when the last great Ice Age ended between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago: this was a warming of about 5\u00b0C over 5,000 years, that is, a rate of only 0.1 \u00b0C per century. 52 The expected magnitude and rate of planetary warming is highly likely to come with major risk and impacts in terms of sea level rise (Pliocene sea level was 25-35 meters higher than now due to smaller Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets), extreme events (for example, hurricane activity is expected to increase in a warmer climate), and ecosystem loss.  The second part of this paper examined the evidence for the current warming of the planet and discussed what is known about its causes. This part showed that global warming is already a measured and-well-established fact, not a theory.

Under Plan A, the Earth\u2019s biosphere is being destroyed \u2013 the sixth mass species extinction, the direct result of large humyn numbers and industrial activity, is well under way. Plan B is Lester Brown\u2019s concept for an alternative future. He has revised his Plan B several times, and the fourth version is now available (Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization by Lester R. Brown (W. W. Norton & Company, 2009).    Plans A and B are essentially the same, in terms of destructive impact on the biosphere. Both involve large humyn numbers and industrial activity. Both are destroying the biosphere. Plan A is unplanned and uncontrolled growth \u2013 unmanaged chaos. Plan B is planned and controlled exploitation, in an attempt to sustain a large humyn population and large amount of industrial activity \u2013 as large as possible (e.g., eight billion). Both Plans A and B represent attempts to continue large humyn numbers and industrial activity for as long as possible. They both represent programs for \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d \u2013 continuation of the large-scale destruction of the biosphere caused by the high level of resource utilization of large-scale industrial activity.    Neither Plan A nor Plan B serves as a long-term-sustainable system of planetary management, for two main reasons and several secondary ones. First, our planet-destroying civilization is the cause of the destruction of the biosphere in which humyn life evolved and on which humyn life depends. This civilization should not be saved \u2013 it must not be saved. If the mass species extinction is to be stopped and huhumynkind is to be saved, this civilization must be ended as quickly as possible. Second, we are just now passing Hubbert\u2019s Peak \u2013 the point in time at which global oil production starts to decline, as the planet\u2019s oil reserves deplete. Large-scale industrial civilization will end soon because the energy on which it depends is exhausting. Other reasons why Plans A and B are unlikely to work for very long are the facts that humyn societies have been observed to evolve to a high level of complexity that can no longer be supported and collapse when they attempt to simplify, and that dynamic systems in general (natural or otherwise) tend to fail catastrophically when serious problems are encountered.

Tainter\u2019s The Collapse of Complex Societies (Cambridge University Press, 1988) and Jared Diamond\u2019s Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (Viking, 2005) for discussion of these points.

This was a very grave concern of Plato\u2019s. He regarded democracy as a very inferior form of government. Quoting from Desmond Lee\u2019s Introduction to Plato: The Republic (second edition, Penguin Books, 1974), \u201cIn democracy there is a radical lack of cohesion, because there is no proper respect for authority, moral or political. Democratic government is weak government, which plays on the weaknesses of the common humyn instead of giving him the leadership he needs; and it is liable to degenerate into a bitter class-struggle between the haves and the have-nots.\u201d Further, \u201cIt involved, said Thucydides, \u2018committing the conduct of state affairs to the whims of the multitude,\u2019 and it has been described by a modern writer as government by perpetual plebiscite. \u2026Democracy encourages bad leadership. The people\u2019s judgment of their leaders is not always good, and they can\u2019t be trusted to make the best choice. But quite apart from that, the popular leader, dependent as he is for his position (and perhaps his income) on popular favour, will constantly be tempted to retain that favour by the easiest possible means. He will play on the likes and dislikes, the weaknesses and foibles of the public, will never tell them an unpleasant truth or advocate a policy that might make them uncomfortable. Like the modern advertiser and salesman, he is dependent on his public, and his position depends on selling them comfort and not telling them the truth. Sophist, salesman, and popular politician are on a par, and the people care little who their leaders are provided they \u2018profess themselves the people\u2019s friends.\u2019 Popular leaders are as devoid of true knowledge as are the people they lead. \u2026But that is not the whole story. The salient characteristic of democracy, we learn in Book VIII, is liberty \u2013 every individual is free to do as he likes. This gives democratic society a diversity and variety that are very attractive, but its effect is extremely disintegrating. There is a growing dislike of any authority, political or moral; fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, \u2018and the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable.\u2019\u201d Some additional caveats are in order. While the purpose and topics of interest of Plato\u2019s Republic (read Society) and ours may be similar in many respects (i.e., the quest for a social organization for justice and right conduct; ethics, education, and philosophy as well as politics; survival), the situation or context in which we find ourselves today is quite different from that of Plato\u2019s time. The primary objective in Plato\u2019s day was survival and development and maintenance of the Greek city-state. The primary objective of Solaria is the survival and development and maintenance of the entire planet (or, more specifically, of the humyn species and a biologically diverse biosphere). Given this significant difference in circumstance, the manner of implementation of a Platonic social organization for planetary management may differ in some details. For example, war was then (for several centuries) recognized and utilized as a legitimate and useful means of population control. In our context \u2013 a destroyed world in the wake of global nuclear war \u2013 continual war may not be, and is probably not, the best means of population control, or a basis for long-term survivability of the species and the biosphere as we know it.", "", "", ""], "id": "7f58f25f2873f75af68891a685a9e65a39c2050a7cd12cfa92fd6a27e39e8340", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[6, 0, 156], [6, 180, 312], [6, 416, 621], [6, 622, 627], [6, 628, 770], [6, 782, 1116], [6, 1323, 1930], [6, 2176, 2410], [6, 2414, 2812], [6, 2920, 3052], [6, 3053, 3058], [6, 3059, 3272], [6, 3286, 3498], [6, 3521, 3645]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark_II.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2001-01-01"}, {"tag": "2.

They did not envision or envisage the radical individualism and the radical egalitarianism of today, and had no intention of allowing for direct democracy (e.g., referenda) or extending democracy to all people. A level of participation (of people in government) was tolerated, but not to the degree of relinquishing a significant degree of control. Democracy was introduced to give the masses a sense of participation, as long as it did not significantly interfere with the accumulation and distribution of wealth for the small proportion of society that was in, and remained in, control. Although the founders were able to establish a mass-appeal system that enabled them to continue in control (in their activity of accumulating wealth and exercising power), they had little concern or regard for (or, at that time, impact on) the global environment.

No one would think of letting a platoon of soldiers decide by vote what they did or did not want to do. The same is true of an airplane or a ship, or a business, or a religion, or a family.

What is wrong with high levels of individual liberty and industrial development? Well, what is wrong with democracy is that it is a very poor system for promoting the long-term survival of the biosphere as we know it \u2013 either of the humyn species or the other species in it. The concept underlying democracy is that it helps people pursue life, liberty and happiness. With a large amount of personal freedom, the prospect of keeping a large share of the product of one\u2019s labour, and access to plenty of resources, the citizens of a democracy work hard to achieve more. And they do produce and achieve more. But more is never enough. No matter what the standard of living, every nation strives for a higher standard of living. No matter what the total amount of national economic output, every nation wants to increase it. This works fine as long as the humyn population is so small that humynkind\u2019s presence and activities do not have any significant impact on the biodiversity of the planet, but it does not work well at all as soon as the size of the humyn population and its industrial development reach a stage where they begin to make significant changes in the biosphere.    And that is where we are now. Solely as the result of large humyn numbers and industrial production, humynkind is now causing the sixth mass species extinction of the biosphere. And humynity is powerless to stop it. It is not just democracy that is at fault, or is even the principal cause of this problem. All species strive to propagate to fill the space available to them. With the advent of technology and the windfall of fossil fuel, humynkind possessed the wherewithal to reproduce (and produce) to the extent that it was eventually displacing every other species on the planet. It would not matter if the world were run by socialism, monarchism, communism, or any other system of government that encourages people to destroy nature. All that matters is whether the system in place allows the humyn population to grow and produce and consume without limit, to the point where it is destroying much of the natural habitat of the planet.

While the importance of most of these reasons may be disputed, I feel it is necessary to raise them for discussion. The points raised are not meant to lay blame on anyone, but rather to help ensure that peace movement theory and strategy are founded on sound beliefs. By understanding our motivations and emotional responses, some insight may be gained into how better to struggle against nuclear war.(a) Exaggeration to justify inaction. For many people, nuclear war is seen as such a terrible event, and as something that people can do so little about, that they can see no point in taking action on peace issues and do not even think about the danger. For those who have never  been concerned or taken action on the issue, accepting an extreme account of the effects of nuclear war can provide conscious or unconscious justification for this inaction. In short, one removes from one's awareness the upsetting topic of nuclear war, and justifies this psychological denial by believing the worst. This suggests two things. First, it may be more effective in mobilising people against nuclear war to describe the dangers in milder terms. Some experiments have shown that strong accounts of danger - for example, of smoking[17] - can be less effective than weaker accounts in changing behaviour. Second, the peace movement should devote less attention to the dangers of nuclear war and more attention to what people can do to oppose it in their day-to-day lives. (b) Fear of death. Although death receives a large amount of attention in the media, the consideration of one's own death has been one of the most taboo topics in western culture, at least until recently.[18] Nuclear war as an issue raises the topic insistently, and unconsciously many people may prefer to avoid the issue for this reason. The fear of and repression of conscious thoughts about personal death may also lead to an unconscious tendency to exaggerate the effects of nuclear war. One's own personal death - the end of consciousness - can be especially threatening in the context of others remaining alive and conscious. Somehow the death of everyone may be less threatening. Robert Lifton[19] argues that children who learn at roughly the same age about both personal death and nuclear holocaust may be unable to separate the two concepts, and as a result equate death with annihilation, with undesirable consequences for coping individually with life and working collectively against nuclear war. Another factor here may be a feeling of potential guilt at the thought of surviving and having done nothing, or not enough or not the right thing, to prevent the deaths of others. Again, the idea that nearly everyone will die in nuclear war does not raise such disturbing possibilities. (c) Exaggeration to stimulate action. When people concerned about nuclear war describe the threat to others, in many cases this does not trigger any action. An understandable response by the concerned people is to expand the threat until action is triggered. This is valid procedure in many physiological and other domains. If a person does not heed a call of 'Fire!', shouting louder may do the trick. But in many instances of intellectual argument this procedure is not appropriate. In the case of nuclear war it seems clear that the threat, even when stated very conservatively, is already past the point of sufficient stimulation. This means that what is needed is not an expansion of the threat but rather some avenue which allows and encourages people to take action to challenge the threat. A carefully thought out and planned strategy for challenging the war system, a strategy which makes sense to uncommitted people and which can easily accommodate their involvement, is one such avenue.[20] (d) Planning and defeatism. People may identify thinking about and planning for an undesirable future - namely the occurrence and aftermath of nuclear war - with accepting its inevitability (defeatism) or even actually wanting it. By exaggerating the effects of nuclear war and emphasising the worst possible case, there becomes no post-war future at all to prepare for, and so this difficulty does not arise. The limitations of this response are apparent in cases other than nuclear war. Surely it is not defeatism to think about what will happen when a labour strike is broken, when a social revolution is destroyed (as in Chile) or turns bad (as in the Soviet Union), or when political events develop in an expected though unpleasant way (as Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s). Since, I would argue, some sort of nuclear war is virtually inevitable unless radical changes occur in industrialised societies, it is realism rather than defeatism to think about and take account of the likely aftermath of nuclear war. An effective way to deal with the feeling or charge of defeatism is to prepare for the political aftermath of nuclear war in ways which reduce the likelihood of nuclear war occurring in the first place. This can be done for example by developing campaigns for social defence, peace conversion and community self-management in ways which serve both as preparation to resist political repression in time of nuclear crisis or war, and as positive steps to build alternatives now to war-linked institutions.[21] (e) Exaggeration to justify concern (I). People involved with any issue or activity tend to exaggerate its importance so as to justify and sustain their concern and involvement. Nuclear war is only one problem among many pressing problems in the world, which include starvation, poverty, exploitation, racial and sexual inequality and repressive governments. By concentrating on peace issues, one must by necessity give less attention to other pressing issues. An unconscious tendency to exaggerate the effects of nuclear war has the effect of reducing conscious or unconscious guilt at not doing more on other issues. Guilt of this sort is undoubtedly common, especially among those who are active on social issues and who become familiar with the wide range of social problems needing attention. The irony is that those who feel guilt for this reason tend to be those who have least cause to feel so. One politically effective way to overcome this guilt may be to strengthen and expand links between anti-war struggles and struggles for justice, equality and the like. (f) Exaggeration to justify concern (II). Spokespeople and apologists for the military establishment tend to emphasise conservative estimates of the effects of nuclear war. They also are primarily concerned with military and economic 'survival' of society so as to confront further threats to the state. One response to this orientation by people favouring non-military approaches to world order and peace is to assume that the military-based estimates are too low, and hence to exaggerate the effects and emphasise worst cases. The emotional underpinning for this response seems to be something like this: 'if a militarist thinks nuclear war will kill 100 million people and still wants more nuclear weapons, and because I am totally opposed to nuclear war or plans for waging it, therefore nuclear war surely would kill 500 million people or everyone on earth.' This sort of unconscious reasoning confuses one's estimate of the size of a threat with one's attitude towards it. A more tenable conclusion is that the value structures of the militarist and the peace activist are sufficiently different to favour very different courses of action when considering the same evidence. The assumption that a given item of information will lead to a uniform emotional response or conclusion about its implications is false. The primary factor underlying differences in response to the threat of nuclear war is not differences in assessments of devastation, but political differences."], "id": "f2973ed24528369c23496e23d9cdee43350e5a08b785fbb4300b5110f40320c0", "highlighted_text": "For those who have never  been concerned or taken action on the issue, accepting an extreme account of the effects of nuclear war can provide conscious or unconscious justification for this inaction one removes from one's awareness the upsetting topic of nuclear war, and justifies this psychological denial by believing the worst Fear of death.

Nuclear weapons have been acquired not only by an extremely poor per capita but large country such as India, but also by even poorer and medium-sized nations such as Pakistan and North Korea. One could also mention South Africa, which successfully acquired a nuclear arsenal despite economic sanctions (the likes of which have not yet been imposed on Iran). It is widely believed that sanctions and rhetoric will not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and that many countries, in the Middle East and beyond, will act accordingly (see, e.g., recent Heritage report). Nuclear Warfare -- Myths And Facts The direct consequences of the limited use of nuclear weapons -- especially low-yield devices most likely to be in the hands of non-state actors or irresponsible governments -- would probably not be great enough to bring about significant geopolitical upheavals. Casualties from a single 20-KT nuclear device are estimated [1] at about 25,000 fatalities with a similar number of injured, assuming a rather unfortunate scenario (the center of a large city, with minimal warning). Scaling the above toll to larger devices or to a larger number of devices is less than linear. For example, it has been estimated that it would take as many as eighty devices of 20-KT yield each to cause 300,000 civilian fatalities in German cities (a result actually achieved by Allied area attacks, or carpet-bombings, during the Second World War). A single 1-MT device used against Detroit has been estimated by U.S. Congress OTA to result in about 220,000 fatalities. It is anticipated that well-prepared civil defense measures, based on rather simple presently known techniques, would decrease these numbers by maybe an order of magnitude (as will be discussed later). There is little doubt that a nation determined to survive and with a strong sense of its own destiny would not succumb to such losses. It is often argued that the fallout effects of even the limited use of nuclear weapons would be worldwide and would last for generations. This is an exaggeration. The following facts speak for themselves. -- In Japan, as assessed by REFR, less than 1,000 excess cancer cases (i.e., above the natural occurrence) were recorded in over 100,000 survivors over the past sixty years -- compared with about 110,000 immediate fatalities in the two atomic bombings. No clinical or even sub-clinical effects were discovered in the survivors' offspring. -- In the Chernobyl area, as assessed by IAEA, only fifteen cancer deaths can be directly attributed to fallout radiation. No radiation-related increase in congenital formations was recorded. Nuclear Conflict -- Possible Scenarios With reference to a possible regional nuclear conflict between a rogue state and a democratic one, the no-winner (mutual assured destruction) scenario is probably false. An analysis by Anthony Cordesman, et al. regarding a possible Israel-Iran nuclear conflict estimated that while Israel might survive an Iranian nuclear blow, Iran would certainly not survive as an organized society. Even though the projected casualties cited in that study seem to us overstated, especially as regards Israel, the conclusion rings true. Due to the extreme high intensity (\"above-conventional\") of nuclear conflict, it is nearly certain that such a war, no matter its outcome, would not last for years, as we have become accustomed to in current low-intensity conflicts. Rather, we should anticipate a new geo-political reality: the emergence of clear winners and losers within several days, or at most weeks after the initial outbreak of hostilities. This latter reality will most probably contain fewer nuclear-possessing states than the former."], "id": "bfb65294408aef517abe8658f9191ede4897da8ac6be47bd20629d95da9cf21d", "highlighted_text": "The direct consequences of use of nuclear weapons would not be great enough to bring upheaval Casualties from a single device are 25,000 civil defense measures would decrease numbers by an order of magnitude a nation determined to survive would not succumb to losses fallout effects is exaggeration In Japan , less than 1,000 cancer cases were recorded in 100,000 survivors over sixty years Due to the intensity of nuclear conflict such a war would not last for years we should anticipate clear winners within days", "highlights": [[3, 728, 754], [3, 767, 789], [3, 905, 910], [3, 920, 939], [3, 940, 948], [3, 980, 988], [3, 991, 1015], [3, 1030, 1040], [3, 1064, 1070], [3, 1716, 1738], [3, 1791, 1805], [3, 1812, 1822], [3, 1829, 1850], [3, 1908, 1938], [3, 1982, 2002], [3, 2008, 2014], [3, 2044, 2059], [3, 2159, 2161], [3, 2165, 2177], [3, 2224, 2232], [3, 2232, 2233], [3, 2255, 2270], [3, 2278, 2290], [3, 2328, 2344], [3, 2350, 2372], [3, 2382, 2393], [3, 3314, 3324], [3, 3338, 3347], [3, 3371, 3390], [3, 3418, 3428], [3, 3453, 3477], [3, 3555, 3575], [3, 3622, 3635], [3, 3647, 3653], [3, 3662, 3666]], "underlines": [[3, 728, 754], [3, 767, 789], [3, 905, 910], [3, 920, 939], [3, 940, 948], [3, 980, 988], [3, 988, 989], [3, 991, 1015], [3, 1030, 1040], [3, 1064, 1070], [3, 1716, 1738], [3, 1738, 1739], [3, 1791, 1805], [3, 1812, 1822], [3, 1829, 1850], [3, 1908, 1938], [3, 1982, 2002], [3, 2008, 2014], [3, 2014, 2015], [3, 2044, 2059], [3, 2159, 2161], [3, 2165, 2177], [3, 2224, 2232], [3, 2255, 2270], [3, 2278, 2290], [3, 2328, 2344], [3, 2350, 2372], [3, 2382, 2393], [3, 2394, 2395], [3, 3314, 3324], [3, 3338, 3347], [3, 3371, 3390], [3, 3418, 3428], [3, 3453, 3477], [3, 3477, 3478], [3, 3555, 3575], [3, 3622, 3635], [3, 3647, 3653], [3, 3662, 3666]], "emphasis": [[3, 2165, 2177]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2011-01-02"}, {"tag": "The very question of nuclear war obscures the fact that the march of technological progress makes the development of more destructive weapons inevitable \u2013 only future weapons can cause total human extinction", "cite": "Langford, \u201979 (David, Weapons physicist at Atomic Weapons research establishment in Aldermaston, War in 2080: The Future of Military Technology, pp. 201-202)", "body": ["So far the most appalling destruction we have properly considered has been conveniently measurable in terms of the explosive force of TNT, one megaton approximating an energy release of 10^18 calories (4-2 x 10^18 joules).

Earth doesn\u2019t quite make it as a Type I civilization, as much of our power use is tied up and cannot be diverted into the torrent of raw power which we might theoretically produce.

If you wanted to blow off the top of a mountain on earth to make it ready for mining purposes you could also use one of these tools to get an instant crater. These space based tools could also be used for creating lakes or digging canals almost instantaneously. There is a possibility they could also be used to prevent earthquakes by helping to release ground energy in advance by aiming along faults. Nuclear weapons as the weapons of mass destruction that give governments deterrence against war can quickly be replaced with a space based kinetic gravity space based system possibly saving money on the maintenance and disposal of weapons, the maintenance of nuclear fabrication plants, mining operations and environment degradation perceived to go along with the nuclear weapons industry. The new system does however have high maintenance expenses too which include lifting heavy massive objects into space and getting them and their launch platforms into stable reliable orbits or somehow harvesting metals in space and fabricating the weapons there. Very expensive at the moment but maybe not as expensive as making and maintaining nuclear arsenals and ballistic missile delivery systems. With enough heavy mass sufficiently far away from the earth's surface and the right design it is possible to make the ultimate bunker buster ground penetrating projectile imaginable. Say you wanted to target a dam like the Aswan Dam in Egypt or The Three Gorges Dam in China to decommission either one in the advent of war. A nuclear bomb might not do very much good at causing any damage to these giant concrete/ steel structures because they are designed to take such forces. The best a military planner could hope for might be to send the water damed up behind the dam over the top with a nuclear explosion. Dropping a weapon with the force of an asteroid concentrated at a hard pencil point tip could not only take out a big chuck of a concrete dam structure but it could undermine the rock on either side of such large dams. Calculations by those doing the research shows that a fairly large object in the right shape to concentrate the kinetic energy at a point of impact and not discharge much of that energy as it comes down though the earth's atmosphere in a fire ball with heat treatment surfacing, could ruin cities just as much as a nuclear bomb can without all the radiation contamination. That way after dust clears, days or weeks later, an invading army can march right into ground zero without nearly as much hazard to the troops as a nuclear blast. This weapon can be sized up or down by the size of the target to spare off limits monuments in cities with pin point accuracy that no bomb blast would be able to match. The whole thing is based on the physics of gravity and collisions due to acceleration. Gravity provides enough acceleration if you have enough mass far enough off the ground to maximize kinetic energy release at a point of collision at the surface. The guidance systems that bring a falling or a gliding ballistic missile down to it's target is all that is required to pin point the selected targets. These weapons could easily be lifted into space in various rocket payloads including in the space shuttle bays. Chances are some have already been lifted up maybe even by foreign carriers that did not know they were transporting potential lethal weapons. One way to build a platform to rev up the initial acceleration of the heavy rod like weapons would be to build massive solar energy farms that would feed into some large fly wheel battery's that could be used to create an electro magnetic field that could almost instantly accelerate a massive object before gravity took over. A magnetic launch means that no fuel has to be lost in the trip so that momentum can be maximized. This weapon not only has the power of a smart asteroid but it has amazing precision and a real simplicity that makes the nuclear weapons trade seem silly and obsolete. There certainly would be dangers including human error, launch/ lifting accidents, failing orbits. There is also an advantage of being able to scale down so that targets can be mapped and all disposed of at once or in waves. Smaller weapon can be independently launched or dropped just to hit individual factories, communication systems, power plants avoiding nuclear plants and just disabling the transmission lines using the best of high resolution spy satellites and military grade GPS for targeting. Unlike a nuclear bomb attack, here thousands of vary small targets and some large ones could be hit simultaneously with as much accuracy as pin pointing places on satellite maps. So finally the space program really has paid off for the military. A single kinetic gravity assist weapon could be put in space to target Russian targets if that is where the US still is doing the targeting or just have a smaller one aimed at certain areas of the Kremlin. Hypothetically No reason to blow up all of Moscow anymore if the US had to return the favor after a Russian nuclear strike on Los Angeles. The Russians ruin Los Angeles. We can send them to live there and take Moscow as an uncontaminated city ready to occupy. That is a military advantage that nukes don't have. It might be possible to aim an objects no bigger than a jack hammer from space with some acceleration assistance and take down a fairly major target without having to fly though hostile air space, risk a submarine becoming visible after firing a missile or being in any position to take fire back. It is also possible to program the systems in space so the weapons could be automatically set to target weapons that might target them by retracing the origin of the offending weapons. Or if the potential attackers are known pre-program the weapons to hit pre-chosen targets in case the space platform is attacked. Systems like this are probably already being tested. It would be a great way to eliminate underground Iranian nuclear testing facilities without having to fly any planes or send missiles over Iranian air space or over neighboring country's air space. The enemy would not really know what hit them because the delivery system is the projectile coming down out of the sky. Made of hardened heavy metal these things would not be easily deflected with missile shields at least not initially. Unlike a vulnerable missile that is hollow metal with fuel inside of it these are solid heavy metal objects with a lot more momentum and possibly a redirecting guidance system operating flaps or louvers to correct for deflection. Another more advanced system might have a number of objects accelerated to even faster speeds by sending them around the sun or moon using gravity assistance and then keeping them in orbit at those high speeds until ready to send down to hit a terrestrial target or a lunar target for that mater (perhaps for a mining operation) The faster an object is moving before it's collision with a part of the earth landscape the more lethal it can become. It is possible to accelerate a heavy piece of metal send it down to earth where it completely annihilates itself , digs a huge crater proving it self as lethal as a nuclear weapon without the radiation contamination and better reliable pin pointing of targets. One day in the near future the spaces weapons race is probably inevitably on the verge of happening. It might take a war of some kind for the technology to be tested. There are no shortages of wars. It was just 2009 that a similar bit of technology was launched at one of the poles on the moon for a scientific experiment. This was a less massive object not intended to maximize destruction but just to kick up a plume of dust and debris for remote analysis. That may have been one of the first real tests of the real technology that will quickly come to make nuclear weapons obsolete. There are other uses too. An example would be to send down bowling ball size \"pellets\" from space into large industrial smelting chambers to allow kinetic energy fire to smelt masses of raw aluminum and other un processed metal without having to hook up giant electric grids. Finally NASA would have a space industry that could pay for payloads of bowling ball size pellets that could generate more heat at lower cost than burning coal or diesel to get the same results. If metals could be found in space either from space junk debris or mining on some asteroid or the moon then kinetic energy from space could beat using microwave beams to send solar energy back to earth. The technology has more peaceful uses than it does for warfare. Those who really don't like nuclear weapons should probably prefer this system a little more. It will never please anyone who believes that all weapons are bad.", ""], "id": "ace76b635d5d9d5e3a37e79f8aa5e49cf663b86c1298c7f4ec85d62dd242aeae", "highlighted_text": "Nuclear weapons can quickly be replaced with a space based kinetic gravity system .

The original TTAPS paper[20] and accompanying Ehrlich et al. paper[21] illustrate the way this can occur. I argue here that these papers make a series of assumptions which emphasize the worst case for the effects of nuclear war. (1) Targeting. The TTAPS paper uses a baseline case of 5000 megatonnes (MT), supplemented by a wide range of other scenarios which also lead to nuclear winter effects. Though in general terms some of the scenarios appear reasonable, no detailed strategic rationale is offered for any of them [22]. A cynic might say that the key characteristic of the scenarios is that they produce sufficient smoke or dust to produce nuclear winter. This is illustrated by the 100MT scenario, which is often misinterpreted as 100 bombs on 100 cities. Actually it involves 1000 bombs and the burning of a vast number of cities each of just the right size. It is easy to misinterpret the results for this scenario as showing that any 100MT war is enough to trigger nuclear winter, whereas any militarily realistic targeting of 100MT would cause relatively few cities to burn and probably produce little cooling according to present models. If the scenarios had been designed to produce a spread of soot injections rather than a fairly constant soot injection for different megatonnages, the result of nuclear winter would have seemed more sensitive to variations in targeting. Ehrlich et al. concentrate on a 10,000MT scenario which generates more severe environmental effects than either the Ambio scenario[23] or the TTAPS baseline case. They state that they take the TTAPS 10,000MT 'severe' case as their reference case because of policy implications[24]. (According to Michael MacCracken, TTAPS in their draft paper presented a 10,000MT baseline. After receiving comments, they corrected an error of a factor of 2 in the smoke density and also reset the baseline to 5000MT. These two changes counteracted each other, leaving the baseline consequences unchanged. Ehrlich et al. considered a maximum but to them plausible scenario which, after the factor of 2 adjustment, turned out to be the TTAPS 10,000MT scenario[25].)", ""], "id": "8176f5ab879db334c612f54562a81dc8fd931ab46cc80d2fcbc2e71d1f7108e4", "highlighted_text": "the science of nuclear winter make assumptions which emphasize the worst case for the effects of nuclear war. no strategic rationale is offered .

For example, food shortages due to crop failures are highlighted, plus difficulties in transporting stored food to population centres.

For Third World countries, they emphasise dependence on imports of food from rich countries. They do not mention the exports of food to rich countries, nor the high level of cash cropping for export to industrialised countries, which could be replaced by food crops for local consumption[32-34]. The suggestion that extinction of human life could occur is made without considering any counterexamples. For example, consider Tasmania. As an island in the southern hemisphere, nuclear winter effects would be minimised. It has large hydropower capacity for providing heat and power, and the large sheep population could help tide the modest human population through a failed harvest. Such examples are not addressed by Ehrlich et al. The possibility of extinction is not even discussed in the text of Ehrlich et al.'s paper. It is only raised in the summary and conclusion[35]  The combination of these assumptions leads to concentration on worst cases. The selection of results for key diagrams and abstracts makes the drawing of certain policy implications much easier. In other words, the TTAPS and Ehrlich et al. papers are not 'value-neutral' pieces of research, but 'push' certain conclusions on readers through technical assumptions in model construction, selection of evidence and highlighting of results. One response to these points is that the authors should have been slower to rush into print and more careful in their presentation of results, given that portions of the media are well known for sensationalism.

The 1983 'Nuclear Winter \" papers in Science were so politicized that even the eminently liberal President of The Council for a Liveable World called \"The worst example ofthe misrepesentation of science to the public in my memory.\" Among the authors was Stanford President Donald Kennedy. Today he edits Science , the nation's major arbiter of climate science--and policy. Below, a case illustrating the mid-range of the ~.7 to ~1.6 degree C maximum cooling the 2006 studies suggest is superimposed in color on the Blackly Apocalyptic predictions published in Science Vol. 222, 1983 . They're worth comparing, because the range of soot concentrations in the new models overlaps with cases assumed to have dire climatic consequences in the widely publicized 1983 scenarios --Meltdownofttaps \"Apocalyptic predictions require, to be taken seriously,higher standards of evidence than do assertions on other matters where the stakes are not as great.\" wrote Sagan in Foreign Affairs , Winter 1983 -84. But that \"evidence\" was never forthcoming. 'Nuclear Winter' never existed outside of a computer except as air-brushed animation commissioned by the a PR firm - Porter Novelli Inc. Yet Sagan predicted \"the extinction of the human species \" as temperatures plummeted 35 degrees C and the world froze in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. Last year, Sagan's cohort tried to reanimate the ghost in a machine anti-nuclear activists invoked in the depths of the Cold War, by re-running equally arbitrary scenarios on a modern interactive Global Circulation Model. But the Cold War is history in more ways than one. It is a credit to post-modern computer climate simulations that they do not reproduce the apocalyptic results of what Sagan oxymoronically termed \"a sophisticated one dimensional model.\" The subzero 'baseline case' has melted down into a tepid 1.3 degrees of average cooling- grey skies do not a Ragnarok make. What remains is just not the stuff that End of the World myths are made of. It is hard to exaggerate how seriously \" nuclear winter \"was once taken by policy analysts who ought to have known better. Many were taken aback by the sheer force of Sagan's rhetoric Remarkably, Science's news coverage of the new results fails to graphically compare them with the old ones Editor Kennedy and other recent executives of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, once proudly co-authored and helped to publicize. You can't say they didn't try to reproduce this Cold War icon. Once again, soot from imaginaryPropaganda_penguin_1_1 software materializes in midair by the megaton , flying higher than Mount Everest . This is not physics, but a crude exercise in ' garbage in, gospel out' parameter forcing designed to maximize and extend the cooling an aeosol can generate, by sparing it from realistic attrition by rainout in the lower atmosphere. Despite decades of progress in modeling atmospheric chemistry , there is none in this computer simulation, and ignoring photochemistry further extends its impact. Fortunately , the history of science is as hard to erase as it is easy to ignore. Their past mastery of semantic agression cannot spare the authors of \"Nuclear Winter Lite \" direct comparison of their new results and their old. Dark smoke clouds in the lower atmosphere don't last long enough to spread across the globe. Cloud droplets and rainfall remove them, rapidly washing them out of the sky in a matter of days to weeks- not long enough to sustain a global pall. Real world weather brings down particles much as soot is scrubbed out of power plant smoke by the water sprays in smoke stack scrubbers Robock acknowledges this- not even a single degree of cooling results when soot is released at lower elevations in he models . The workaround is to inject the imaginary aerosol at truly Himalayan elevations - pressure altitudes of 300 millibar and higher , where the computer model's vertical transport function modules pass it off to their even higher neighbors in the stratosphere , where it does not rain and particles linger.. The new studies like the old suffer from the disconnect between a desire to paint the sky black and the vicissitudes of natural history. As with many exercise in worst case models both at invoke rare phenomena as commonplace, claiming it prudent to assume the worst. But the real world is subject to Murphy's lesser known second law- if everything must go wrong, don't bet on it. In 2006 as in 1983 firestorms and forest fires that send smoke into the stratosphere rise to alien prominence in the modelers re-imagined world , but i the real one remains a very different place, where though every month sees forest fires burning areas the size of cities - 2,500 hectares or larger , stratospheric smoke injections arise but once in a blue moon. So how come these neo-nuclear winter models feature so much smoke so far aloft for so long? The answer is simple- the modelers intervened. Turning off vertical transport algorithms may make Al Gore happy- he has bet on reviving the credibility Sagan's ersatz apocalypse , but there is no denying that in some of these scenarios human desire, not physical forces accounts for the vertical hoisting of millions of tons of mass ten vertical kilometers into the sky.to the level at which the models take over , with results at once predictable --and arbitrary.

The 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers were aircraft with a lot of aviation fuel, which burned inside the buildings. A nuclear bomb doesn't deposit aviation fuel inside buildings, and anyway, buildings shadow one another from the thermal pulse before the blast arrives (by which time the thermal pulse is generally over). If the thermal pulse is strong, you get immediate surface ablation which causes a smoke screen that stops further heating and prevents fires. The only way you get ignition is by having (1) large windows with a direct line-of sight to the fireball (no intervening buildings) with no blinds and rooms filled with junk like old papers, magazines, and easily inflammable old-type furnishings (not banned by modern fire safety standards) of the 1953 \"Encore\" nuclear test type, or rooms again with an unobstructed line of sight to the fireball with black-colored World War II air raid \"black out\" curtains (which were used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to stop city house lights being used to guide American bombers to targets in night-time air raids, something no longer done!) which can ignite easily, or (2) easily overturned charcoal cooking stoves inside thousands of wooden houses filled with paper screens and bamboo inflammables, as in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the breakfast time and lunch time attacks.  The worst firestorm of WWI was in Hamburg in a medieval crowded part of wooden multistory buildings and killed 5% of the population at risk, although CND and other propaganda from Ted Postol and others claims that the entire population was killed. You can't have that happen again: the wooden buildings were replaced with brick and concrete. Although it is possible for some fires to ignite inside buildings containing some wooden furnishings and non-fire resistant bedding and sofas, the non-wooden buildings don't cause anything like the same risks of either firespread or the intensity of burning required for firestorms that wooden houses give. The firestorm in Hiroshima was lethal because the population was in shock from the explosion and survivors outdoors (due to no \"duck and cover\", just watching the bomb fall and getting facial burns and blast debris/displacement injury in addition to INR), and so were generally injured and unable to rescue people trapped under easily-collapsed wooden buildings, before they burned, many taking 30 minutes to 2 hours to ignite! This situation won't occur again. The centers of even American cities generally don't contain wooden houses anymore: British and most European cities haven't had wooden houses built for centuries. American wooden houses are generally now in suburbs on the periphery of cities and are unlikely to be within reach of the thermal effects of modern MIRVed missile warheads (100-300 kt yield range).  The TTAPS nuclear winter people including Sagan were debunked in the 1980s. First, modern cities of brick and concrete can't be ignited or burn with the intensity of predominantly wooden buildings in Hiroshima: so you don't get a firestorm. There's not enough smoke to cause a nuclear winter. Sagan and another guy wrote another article and also their 1989 book called \"A Path Where No Man Thought\", denying the debunkers by claiming that nuclear weapons would all be used against oil refineries and forests, and the burning oil and trees would produce the soot needed for nuclear winter.  Again, there is evidence that this is a lie: the forests imported to the Nevada test site and naturally on Bikini Atoll islands and Eniwetok Atoll islands were filmed receiving massive thermal radiation and just \"smoked\" during the thermal flash. The smoke shielded thermal radiation. There was no firestorm! The vegetation shadows and thus protects the fine kindling underbrush from thermal radiation. I've blogged this in detail. Some British tests in Australia and over Christmas and Malden islands caused isolated fires in dry vegetation, but this was the exception and not the rule. Most of the data given for ignition in the 1957 edition of Glasstone's \"Effects of Nuclear Weapons\" was wrong (as Glasstone acknowledged in the Preface to the February 1964 reprinted edition), because experimenters had exposed dried forest kindling to thermal radiation. In fact, there is almost always some equilibrium moisture in it, which dramatically increases the thermal energy needed for sustained ignition (not just temporary flaming/smoking which only lasts for the duration of the thermal pulse).  Oil and gas tanks were ignited by the Texas City ship explosion in 1947, but that was from hot fragments of an exploding ship full of chemical explosive. Nuclear weapons produce thermal flash and blast, and the thermal flash merely scorches the paint on the outside of the oil or gas tank. When the blast arrives after the thermal flash subsides, it may damage the oil or gas tank, but doesn't ignite it. This is confirmed by nuclear test data from 1955. In addition, Saddam's army ignited all of the oil fields in Kuwait in the early 1990s, and we're still alive: in Hiroshima the soot from the firestorm fell out as the \"black rain\" (which wasn't significantly radioactive, since the black rain from the firestorm fell an hour after the detonation, when radioactive mushroom cloud had been blown miles downwind, leaving only trivial diffusive airborne activity in the target area). The \"black rain\" at Hiroshima tells you what happens to soot in the atmosphere after a firestorm: it rapidly gets washed out in rain. Even if that doesn't happen, it won't form a stable, uniform cloud; turbulent instabilities will prevent soot from freezing the whole planet.

The cooling mechanism as Sagan and associates describe it, could only operate over land masses. Ocean surface water is continually supplied with heat from below. Even if sunlight were blocked for many months, the temperature at the ocean surface would remain virtually unchanged. Consequently, weather patterns would continue, with warm moisture laden air from the oceans sweeping over the land masses and as it cools, rain clouds would form and even more of the sun blocking smoke and dust particles would be washed out of the atmosphere. 2. Sagan et al indicated that at the very least, 100 million tons of smoke particles would have to be injected into the atmosphere if the nuclear winter mechanism were to be triggered. They also indicated that cities are the primary source of that smoke. They therefore proposed a nuclear war scenario in which cities are the primary targets. Since the mid 1960s, the primary targets for both U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles and nuclear bombs have not been population centers or cities. They have been the other guy's nuclear missile launch sites, nuclear bomber bases and other military targets. If those can be eliminated, the cities will be held hostage. The current list of ten target classes ascribed to Soviet planners by DOD and FEMA, does not specifically contain any population centers. The list does of course include target classes that in many instances will be located in or adjacent to metropolitan areas. But, even in those instances, the nuclear weapons employed will not be the huge multimegaton area destruction bombs of the late 1950s and early 1960s. ICBM systems and MIRVs are now so accurate that a target may be pinpointed even within a metropolitan area, by a relatively small weapon. This is not in any way to say that the effects will not be catastrophic. It is to say though that the city wide firestorms necessary for the onset of nuclear winter as described by Sagan and associates, are less than predictable. In fact, they are improbable.

To explode enough nuclear weapons of any size to completely destroy American cities would be an irrational waste of warheads. The Soviets can make much better use of most of the warheads that would be required to completely destroy American cities; the majority of those warheads probably already are targeted to knock out our retaliatory missiles by being surface burst or near-surface burst on their hardened silos, located far from most cities and densely populated areas. Unfortunately, many militarily significant targets - including naval vessels in port and port facilities, bombers and fighters on the ground, air base and airport facilities that can be used by bombers, Army installations, and key defense factories - are in or close to American cities. In the event of an all-out Soviet attack, most of these '\"soft\" targets would be destroyed by air bursts. Air bursting (see Fig. 1.4) a given weapon subjects about twice as large an area to blast effects severe enough to destroy \"soft\" targets as does surface bursting (see Fig. 1.1) the same weapon. Fortunately for Americans living outside blast and fire areas, air bursts produce only very tiny particles. Most of these extremely small radioactive particles remain airborne for so long that their radioactive decay and wide dispersal before reaching the ground make them much less life- endangering than the promptly deposited larger fallout particles from surface and near-surface bursts. However, if you are a survival minded American you should prepare to survive heavy fallout wherever you are. Unpredictable winds may bring fallout from unexpected directions. Or your area may be in a \"hot spot\" of life-endangering fallout caused by a rain-out or snow-out of both small and tiny particles from distant explosions. Or the enemy may use surface or near-surface bursts in your part of the country to crater long runways or otherwise disrupt U.S. retaliatory actions by producing heavy local fallout. Today few if any of Russia's largest intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are armed with a 20-megaton warhead. A huge Russian ICBM, the SS-18, typically carries 10 warheads each having a yield of 500 kilotons, each programmed to hit a separate target. See \"Jane's Weapon Systems. 1987-1988.\" However, in March 1990 CIA Director William Webster told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that \".... The USSR's strategic modernization program continues unabated,\" and that the SS-18 Mod 5 can carry 14 to 20 nuclear warheads. The warheads are generally assumed to be smaller than those of the older SS-18s. \u00b0 Myth: A heavy nuclear attack would set practically everything on fire, causing \"firestorms\" in cities that would exhaust the oxygen in the air. All shelter occupants would be killed by the intense heat. \u00b0 Facts: On a clear day, thermal pulses (heat radiation that travels at the speed of light) from an air burst can set fire to easily ignitable materials (such as window curtains, upholstery, dry newspaper, and dry grass) over about as large an area as is damaged by the blast. It can cause second-degree skin burns to exposed people who are as far as ten miles from a one-megaton (1 MT) explosion. (See Fig. 1.4.) (A 1-MT nuclear explosion is one that produces the same amount of energy as does one million tons of TNT.) If the weather is very clear and dry, the area of fire danger could be considerably larger. On a cloudy or smoggy day, however, particles in the air would absorb and scatter much of the heat radiation, and the area endangered by heat radiation from the fireball would be less than the area of severe blast damage. \"Firestorms\" could occur only when the concentration of combustible structures is very high, as in the very dense centers of a few old American cities.

An air burst, for example, is estimated to produce about 1032 molecules of nitrogen oxides per megaton of TNT equivalent ... hence, the nitrogen oxides from such explosions would be expected to enhance mechanisms which tend to decrease the ozone concentration.' This is false because: (1) the initial gamma radiation from both surface and air bursts produce a large ozone layer around the early fireball, shielding the early thermal radiation from the fireball after nuclear explosions, and this ozone production is not mentioned in the book. The mechanism for the production of ozone naturally is the absorption by oxygen molecules (O2) of short-wavelength ultraviolet light, bordering the soft X-ray spectrum. In addition to ozone formation by gamma radiation, nuclear weapons release typically 70-80% of their energy as such soft X-rays in a blackbody distribution (Glasstone and Dolan, pp. 23-5) which is soon degraded by air scatter into ultraviolet radiation which forms ozone. The reaction is: 3O2 + energy -> 2O3. The heat released by the natural ozone-forming process is the reason for the increase in the temperature of the stratosphere with altitude. The natural chemical reaction produces about 4,500 tons of ozone per second in the stratosphere, which maintains equilibrium by being broken down at a similar rate by other natural chemical reactions. (2) the nitrogen oxides, largely nitrogen dioxide, in the fireball soon reacts with moisture in the white mushroom cloud to produce nitric acid, which is later precipitated in rainfall along with naturally produced nitric acid from lightning storms, and has no effect on the ozone layer. A lightning storm is qualitatively like a nuclear explosion in that it produces both ozone (from the electrical discharge air ionization) and nitrogen oxides (from the shock waves formed around the extremely hot lightning bolts, which are later heard as thunder). Nitric acid (HNO3) production from the mixing with nitrogen dioxide and water vapour in the fireball is described by the reaction: 3NO2 + H2O -> 2HNO3 + NO then the nitrogen oxide, NO, itself gets oxidized into nitric acid by the reaction: 4NO + 3O2 + 2H2O -> 4HNO3 It was a bigger hoax than Piltdown Man to suggest that nitrogen oxides from nuclear bomb tests could break down ozone; they instead get oxidised into nitric acid by atmospheric moisture and oxygen before they can reach the ozone layer. For a published discussion of the nitric acid production in the air around the fireball from an atmospheric nuclear explosion, see Murray Scheibe, The Increased Attachment Due to Ionization-Induced Smog in EMP Environments, Mission Research Corporation, California, MRC-R-532, DNA5077F, ADA087850, 1979: 'The increased electron attachment due to HNO3 production in the EMP source region is investigated. The HNO3 produced is found to be roughly linear with the total ionization up to an ionization value of about 2 x 10 to the 16th power ion pairs. Above this, the HNO3 production is less than linear.' P. Goldsmith, A. F. Tuck, J. S. Foot, E. L. Simmons and R. L. Newson, reported in their paper, 'Nitrogen oxides, nuclear weapon testing, Concorde and stratospheric ozone' published in Nature, vol. 244 (1973), issue 5418, pp. 545-551: 'Although amounts of nitrogen oxides equivalent to the output from many concordes were released into the atmosphere when nuclear testing was at its peak, the amount of ozone in the atmosphere was not affected.' In total, the U.S.A, U.S.S.R., U.K., France and China detonated 545.4 megatons in the atmosphere, the peak rate of testing occurring in 1962, see page 295 of Merril Eisenbud and Thomas F. Gesell, Environmental Radioactivity, Academic Press, 4th ed., 1997 (the ten biggest atmospheric tests are listed on an earlier post, here). Finally, for high altitude explosions, there is no high pressure air blast wave, thus no production of nitrogen oxides whatsoever, but the gamma radiation striking the atmosphere still produces ozone! Therefore, such explosions have the exact opposite effect on the ozone layer to the claims being made.

However, this is seldom lethal, and could be avoided by reducing exposure to sunlight. Potentially more serious would be effects on crops.[32] Some of the important grains, for example, are sensitive to uv. Whether the net effects on crop yields would be significant is hard to estimate. But whatever the reduction in ozone, ozone levels would return pretty much to normal after a few years. [9] It seems unlikely that in the context of a major nuclear war the changes in uv alone would be of serious concern. In particular, the threat of human extinction raised by Jonathan Schell in The Fate of the Earth,[33] based mostly on effects of increased UV from ozone reduction, seems very small indeed. It is sometimes claimed that nuclear war could destroy ozone to such an extent that humans and animals would be blinded by excess uv. Even if large numbers of high-yield weapons were exploded, this possibility seems very unlikely except for a contribution to snow blindness in the far north. Stratospheric ozone can never be completely removed, but at most reduced greatly. Even if a 50 per cent or more reduction in ozone occurred - and as noted this seems improbable with present nuclear arsenals - protection from uv for humans could be obtained from sunglasses or just ordinary glasses, which absorb uv. For animals, the following considerations are relevant. Ozone levels vary considerably from place to place and from time to time, both seasonally and daily (sometimes by up to 50 per cent). Sunlight at the equator typically passes through only half as much ozone as at the mid-latitudes, yet animals at the equator are not known to go blind more often than elsewhere. Furthermore, most ozone reductions from a nuclear war would be in the mid and high latitudes, where ozone levels are higher to start with and where the 'path length' of sunlight through ozone is increased due to its oblique angle of incidence.

What about nuclear fallout? Wouldn't the radiation from a nuclear war contaminate the whole earth, killing everyone?  The short answer is: absolutely not. Nuclear fallout is a problem, but we should not exaggerate its effects. As it happens, there are two types of fallout produced by nuclear detonations. These are: 1) delayed fallout; and 2) short-term fallout.  According to researcher Peter V. Pry, \"Delayed fallout will not, contrary to popular belief, gradually kill billions of people everywhere in the world.\" Of course, delayed fallout would increase the number of people dying of lymphatic cancer, leukemia, and cancer of the thyroid. \"However,\" says Pry, \"these deaths would probably be far fewer than deaths now resulting from ... smoking, or from automobile accidents.\"  The real hazard in a nuclear war is the short-term fallout. This is a type of fallout created when a nuclear weapon is detonated at ground level. This type of fallout could kill millions of people, depending on the targeting strategy of the attacking country. But short-term fallout rapidly subsides to safe levels in 13 to 18 days. It is not permanent. People who live outside of the affected areas will be fine. Those in affected areas can survive if they have access to underground shelters. In some areas, staying indoors may even suffice.  Contrary to popular misconception, there were no documented deaths from short-term or delayed fallout at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

On the eighth day green buds, 1-3 mm in length, were observed on the stems of Scaevola and Messerschmidia plants. On the thirty-fifth day the shoot leaves were 7-15 cm long, covering much of the old stems and giving the plants a green and healthy appearance. By this time many of the other plants had formed new leaves and three species (Portulaca, Triumfetta, and Messerschmidia) had produced new flowers and fruits. The island now had lost its scorched appearance; from the air it looked green rather than brown as it had one month earlier. \"In August, three months after the detonation, the plants were growing well and some species, such as Boerhaavia, had produced new flowers.

The author, Tom J. Chalko, is on the staff of the dynamics and Vibration group in the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, of the University of Melbourne. I assume that his background is in mechanical engineering. However, he is also billed as \"Head of the Geophysics Division\" of \"Scientific Engineering Research P/L, which certainly apears to belong to Chalko in its entirety, and may be nothing more than an extension of himself. It is significant that his position as a \"geophysicist\" appears to be one invented by himself. He is also evidently the founder of \"Thiaoouba Prophecy and The Freedom of Choice\", which lists among Chalko's accomplishments \"The Amazing bioresonant Chakra Shirt. You can also explore the mysteries of self healing, astral travel and levitation. It would appear that Chalko may be a less than totally reliable source of scientific arguments over the explodeability of the Earth.\u00b6 But, of course, we are obliged to consider the argument as well as the source. In this case, the webpage is only a summary or introduction. So I followed the link at the bottom and downloaded the paper in PDF format. The alleged justification is given as a mathematical argument, so that much of the paper will not be accessible to those who don't at least recognize the basics of applied calculus.\u00b6 As one might expect, it's a bogus argument. The premise is an alleged proof that there is a minimum possible size for the central solid core of the Earth, but it's based on the false premise that the core must remain at all times in equilibrium at the center. Furthermore, the argument that the central equilibrium is unstable is based on the false condition that the pressure gradient and gravitational forces act in opposition, but they do not. A solid core displaced from the center sees only restoring forces, and thus cannot be forced from its position as Chalko tries to show. And, if that weren't enough, the viscosity of the liquid outer core and relatively sold mantle are ignored, which is a fatal flaw in any analysis of the dynamic behavior of the core. And, if even that were not enough, there is no thermodynamic analysis at all. How can one argue that the Earth's interior will \"overheat\" if one does not even consider basic thermodynamics?\u00b6 The sun irradiates the Earth's surface to the tune of roughly 1370 Watts per square meter (W/m^2). Climate related changes in radiative forcing are on the order of 1 W/m^2. The average outward geothermal flux is about 0.06 W/m^2. It is hard to see how a change in radiative forcing at the surface, on the order of 1/1000 would seriously affect the already miniscule heat flow from the Earth. In any case, a proper treatment of the thermal conditions at the surface, and throughout the Earth is required to make definitive statements, but there is no attempt at such in Chalko's paper.\u00b6 The other issue is whether or not a planet can \"explode\". As is the case for any explosion, one must demonstrate the presence of an energy source, and a process that can generate energy very much faster than it can be dissipated through radiative of hydrodynamic means. No such source has ever been identified for the Earth or any other planet. There are vague references to radioactive material and fission explosions in various \"exploding planet\" hypotheses (such as Tom van Flandern's), and evidently Chalko makes the same vague argument (or shall we call it \"hope\"?).

For any fixed probability, existential risks are thus more serious than other risk categories. But just how much more serious might not be intuitively obvious. One might think we could get a grip on how bad an existential catastrophe would be by considering some of the worst historical disasters we can think of\u2014 such as the two world wars, the Spanish flu pandemic, or the Holocaust\u2014and then imagining something just a bit worse. Yet if we look at global population statistics over time, we find that these horrible events of the past century fail to register (figure 3). But even this reflection fails to  bring out the seriousness of existential risk. What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is not that they would show up robustly on a plot like the one in figure 3, causing a precipitous drop in world population or average quality of life. Instead, their significance lies primarily in the fact that they would destroy the future. The philosopher Derek Parfit made a similar point \u00b6 with the following thought experiment: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world\u2019s existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills 100%. (2) Would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most \u00b6 people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference \u00b6 between (2) and (3) is very much greater. The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began \u00b6 only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized \u00b6 human history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a \u00b6 second. To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It \u00b6 turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a \u00b6 large number even if one confines one\u2019s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that \u00b6 our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion \u00b6 people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 1018\u00b6 human lives. These lives could \u00b6 also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various \u00b6 biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not \u00b6 how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological  human \u00b6 life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 1034 years.[7] Another estimate, which assumes that \u00b6 future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of \u00b6 1054human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1071 basic computational operations).(4)[8] If we make the less conservative assumption \u00b6 that future civilizations could eventually press close to the absolute bounds of known physics (using some as yet unimagined technology), we get radically higher estimates of the amount of computation and memory storage that is achievable and thus of the number of years of subjective \u00b6 experience that could be realized.[9 Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, which entirely ignores the possibility of space \u00b6 colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 1018  human lives. This \u00b6 implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a  billion human lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain -emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of \u00b6 ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a \u00b6 technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing \u00b6 existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred \u00b6 billion times as much as a billion  human lives. One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any \u00b6 \u201cordinary\u201d good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives. \n"], "id": "1a2a4f121187c187575deace2cfa52890897601e96424b007769912e53ace3c0", "highlighted_text": "existential risks are more serious than other risk categories.

For the sake of argument, however, let us first simply assume that beneficence does not require significant self-sacrifice and see what follows. Although Kant is unclear on this point, we will assume that significant self-sacrifices are supererogatory. Thus, if I must harm one in order to save many, the individual whom I will harm by my action is not morally required to affirm the action. On the other hand, I have a duty to do all that I can for those in need. As a consequence I am faced with a dilemma: If I act, I harm a person in a way that a rational being need not consent to; if I fail to act, then I do not do my duty to those in need and thereby fail to promote an objective end. Faced with such a choice, which horn of the dilemma is more consistent with the formula of the end-in-itself? We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract \u201csocial entity.\u201d It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive \u201coverall social good.\u201d Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons. Robert Nozick, for example, argues that \u201cto use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he [or she] is a separate person, that his is the only life he [or she] has.\u201d But why is this not equally true of all those whom we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, we fail to sufficiently respect and take account of the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction. In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? A morally good agent recognizes that the basis of all particular duties is the principle that \u201crational nature exists as an end in itself.\u201d Rational nature as such is the supreme objective end of all conduct. If one truly believes that all rational beings have an equal value then the rational solution to such a dilemma involves maximally promoting the lives and liberties of as many rational beings as possible. In order to avoid this conclusion, the non-consequentialist Kantian needs to justify agent-centered constraints. As we saw in chapter 1, however, even most Kantian deontologists recognize that agent-centered constraints require a non-value based rationale. But we have seen that Kant\u2019s normative theory is based on an unconditionally valuable end. How can a concern for the value of rational beings lead to a refusal to sacrifice rational beings even when this would prevent other more extensive losses of rational beings? If the moral law is based on the value of rational beings and their ends, then what is the rationale for prohibiting a moral agent from maximally promoting these two tiers of value? If I sacrifice some for the sake of others, I do not use them arbitrarily, and I do not deny the unconditional value of rational beings. Persons may have \u201cdignity, that is, an unconditional and incomparable worth\u201d that transcends any market value, but persons also have a fundamental equality that dictates that some must sometimes give way for the sake of others.

It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of \"aggression,\" but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response. The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime--the Taliban--that rose to power through brutality and repression. This requires us to ask a question that most \"peace\" activists would prefer not to ask: What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime? What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand. The campus left offers no such account. To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility. Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the world. Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters(2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics--as opposed to religion--pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with \"good\" may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of \"good\" that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance.

A pioneering study by Lichtenstein et. al. (1978) examined absolute and relative probability judgments of risk. People know in general terms which risks cause large numbers of deaths and which cause few deaths. However, asked to quantify risks more precisely, people severely overestimate the frequency of rare causes of death, and severely underestimate the frequency of common causes of death. Other repeated errors were also apparent: Accidents were judged to cause as many deaths as disease. (Diseases cause about 16 times as many deaths as accidents.) Homicide was incorrectly judged a more frequent cause of death than diabetes, or stomach cancer. A followup study by Combs and Slovic (1979) tallied reporting of deaths in two newspapers, and found that errors in probability judgments correlated strongly (.85 and .89) with selective reporting in newspapers. People refuse to buy flood insurance even when it is heavily subsidized and priced far below an actuarially fair value. Kunreuther et. al. (1993) suggests underreaction to threats of flooding may arise from \"the inability of individuals to conceptualize floods that have never occurred... Men on flood plains appear to be very much prisoners of their experience... Recently experienced floods appear to set an upward bound to the size of loss with which managers believe they ought to be concerned.\" Burton et. al. (1978) report that when dams and levees are built, they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions. While building dams decreases the frequency of floods, damage per flood is so much greater afterward that the average yearly damage increases. It seems that people do not extrapolate from experienced small hazards to a possibility of large risks; rather, the past experience of small hazards sets a perceived upper bound on risks. A society well-protected against minor hazards will take no action against major risks (building on flood plains once the regular minor floods are eliminated). A society subject to regular minor hazards will treat those minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of the risks (guarding against regular minor floods but not occasional major floods).

As an air burst, the Hiroshima bomb generated little local fallout. So, unlike the prospective victims of an all-out nuclear war, the people of Hiroshima were spared the devastating impact of lingering high levels of radioactivity. The explosion in Nagasaki-the only other nuclear bombing during the war-was an air burst too, so no fallout from other surface bursts drifted to Hiroshima. In contrast, in an all-out nuclear war, many areas, regardless of whether they are hit directly, will have to contend with such radioactive imports. And by today\u2019s standards, the Hiroshima bomb- with only one-thirtieth the destructive power of humanity\u2019s average warhead14-is comparable to a mere battlefield weapon. We must also keep in mind the enormous number of nuclear bombs which might be used in an all-out war. Beyond a certain point, their overall impact-especially on such complex entities as the biosphere, world economy, and human societies-may be qualitatively different from a mere sum of the constituent parts (see below). Also, many bombs are more destructive than one bomb. So a town the size of Hiroshima then, or of Madison, Wisconsin today, would be hit by more than just one bomb. How many then? The following story throws some light on this question. In 1960, President Eisenhower sent a few people to the appropriate headquarters to inquire about America\u2019s war plans. One of his messengers picked a Hiroshima-sized Soviet town. Unlike Hiroshima, nothing about this town made it stand out as an attractive military target. Yet the plans allotted it one bomb with 320 times, and three bombs each with 80 times, the explosive yield of the Hiroshima bomb.2c Hiroshima survivors were also comparatively fortunate in the amount and quality of help they received. True, Japan\u2019s rulers did not rush to their aid but help did eventually come. After an all-out war, it will be too dangerous to walk about.

It helps to recall that in the 1930s, popular images of conventional strategic bombing were that it would be apocalyptic, bringing belligerent countries to their knees quickly. The apocalyptic image was fed by the German bombing of Guernica, a comparatively small city in Spain. When World War II came in Europe, both British and Germans initially refrained from bombing attacks on cities. Once city bombing began and gathered steam, however, it proved to be far less decisive than many had expected. British and German populations managed to adjust and absorb it. Over time, however, the ferocity of Allied bombing of Germany and Japan did approach the apocalyptic levels originally envisioned. In short, dire assumptions about the awesomeness of strategic bombing deterred its initiation, but once initiated did not prevent gradual escalation to the devastating level originally envisioned. Nuclear weapon inventories of countries like India and Pakistan are likely to remain small in number and yield for some time. According to press reports, by some U.S. estimates the yields of the 1998 tests were only a few kilotons.

Since humans are social beings who define themselves naturally as parts of families, societies, kinship groups, religions, nations, and humanity as a whole, how they view themselves will depend largely on whether they anticipate the continuing existence of these social entities. In the prenuclear age, the individual obviously dies, but the social unit, the nation, the family, the species, was understood as outliving death. But in the nuclear age, we must anticipate nuclear death as a collective experience, what Norman Cousins called \u201cirrational death\u201d\u2014death of a new kind, a nondiscriminating death without warning, death en masse. \u2018While all deaths are individual, in the mass deaths of the twentieth century, be they at Auschwitz or at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the individual is lost in a faceless, mindless, random destruction. Writer Norman Mailer described the transformation as follows: For the first time in civilized history, perhaps for the first time in all history, we have been forced to live with the suppressed knowledge that the smallest facets of our personality or the most minor projections of our ideas ... might be doomed to die as a cipher in some vast statistical operation in which our teeth would be counted, and our hair would be saved, but our death itself unknown, unhonored and unrewarded, a death which could not follow with dignity as a possible consequence to serious actions we have chosen, but rather a death in a gas chamber or a radioactive city; and so ... in the midst of civilization ... our psyche was subjected itself to the intolerable anxiety that death being causeless, life was causeless as well, and time deprived of cause and effect had come to a stop. If the type of death we anticipate is important because it affects how we view ourselves in the world, then the pervasive fear of nuclear annihilation does not necessarily tell us anything about death per se, but rather it reveals something about the perception humans have of their place and worth in the world. Nuclear weapons challenge a basic belief in the importance of the individual. They challenge possibly the most central tenet of the Judeo-Christian world view: Each individual is unique and important and created in the image of God. If you save one life it is like saving the entire world, the Talmud teaches. \u201cGod so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son,\u201d John says. Now, we are haunted with the image of human beings as objects, as matter, to be burned, radiated, turned into ashes or vapor.

This means-ends dispute is at the core of Montagu and Matson's treatise on the dehumanization of humanity.  They warn: \"its destructive toll is already greater than that of any war, plague, famine, or natural calamity on record -- and its potential danger to the quality of life and the fabric of civilized society is beyond calculation.   For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse....

While it may never be possible to quantify the impact dehumanizing ethics may have had on humanity, it is safe to conclude the foundations of humanness offer great opportunities which would be foregone.  When we calculate the actual losses and the virtual benefits, we approach a nearly inestimable value greater than any tools which we can currently use to measure it.   Dehumanization is nuclear war, environmental apocalypse, and international genocide.  When people become things, they become dispensable.  When people are dispensable, any and every atrocity can be justified.  Once justified, they seem to be inevitable for every epoch has evil and dehumanization is evil's most powerful weapon.

Combined, the results would be devastating. Damage to plants from cold and lack of light would be exacerbated by drought and exposure to air pollutants, acidity, radioactivity, and UV-B radiation, each of which can cause direct damage to plant tissues and/or inhibit photosynthesis. Animals that survived the cold would face starvation as well as assaults from radioactivity, UV-B, and air pollutants. In severe drought or freezing conditions, lack of water could be an additional problem. The ability of ecosystems to function and provide life-support services for civilization would be heavily compromised by such conditions. Populations of many vulnerable organisms would certainly perish, with repercussions throughout food webs. Herbivorous food specialists would disappear in the wake of their food-plants; their predators would also soon find slim pickings. Bees and other insects that are essential for pollination of numerous plants (including dozens of crops) would be vulnerable to cold weather, loss of light for navigation, and the failure of many plants to flower and produce nectar.

By killing billions and destroying industrial infrastructures, nuclear war might, for instance, halt or slow down the suspected trend of global warming. On balance, however, the wars overall environmental impact will almost certainly be on the negative side. Radioactive fallout will contaminate soils and waters. We shall probably learn to adjust to these new conditions, perhaps by shunning certain regions or by carrying radioactivity meters everywhere we go the way our ancestors carried spears. Still, this will lower the quality of human life. Nuclear explosions might create immense quantities of dust and smoke. The dust and smoke might blanket, darken, and cool the entire planet. Although the extent of the damage is unclear,24 it would be far more severe during the growing season-late spring and summer in the northern latitudes. One Cassandran and controversial prediction sounds a bit like the eerie twilight described in H. G. Wells\u2019 The Time Machine. This \u201cnuclear winter\u201d projection forecasts freezing summertime temperatures,25 temporary climatic changes (e.g., violent storms, dramatic reductions in rainfall) lower efficiencies of plant photosynthesis, disruption of ecosystems and farms, loss of many species, and the death of millions of people from starvation and cold. However, even these pessimists expect a return to normal climatic conditions within a few years.26a.27 To appreciate the next environmental effect of nuclear war, we must say a few words about the ozone layer. Ozone is a naturally occurring substance made up of oxygen atoms. Unlike an ordinary oxygen molecule (which is comprised of two atoms and is fairly stable) an ozone molecule is comprised of three atoms and it breaks down more readily Most atmospheric ozone is found some 12 to 30 miles above the earths surface (in the stratosphere). Stratospheric concentrations of ozone are minuscule, occupying less than one-fifth of one-millionth the volume of all other gases in the stratosphere. If all this ozone could be gathered somehow at sea level to form a single undiluted shield around the earth, this shield would be as wide as the typical cover of a hardcover book (one-eighth of an inch).28 However, minuscule as its concentrations are, the ozone layer occupies a respectable place in nature\u2019s scheme of things. Some chemicals which are produced routinely by modern industnal society may react with stratospheric ozone, break it down, and lower its levels. Such depletion may have two adverse conseguences. First, stratospheric ozone selectively absorbs sunlight in certain portions of the ultraviolet and infrared spectrums, so its depletion will cause more of this radiation to reach the earth and change global temperature and rainfall pattems. Second, by absorbing more than 99 percent of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation, stratospheric ozone shields life on earth from its harmful effects (some scientists feel that terrestrial life could not evolve before this protective shield took its place). Ozone depletion might allow more ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth\u2019s surface, thereby disrupting natural ecosystems, lowering agricultural productivity, suppressing the human immune system, and raising the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts.28 Since 1985, extensive temporary reductions of the ozone layer have been observed in polar regions, but their causes (man-made or natural) and implications remain uncertain.29 From 1981 to 1991, the ozone shield over the Northern Hemisphere has been depleted by 5 percent, thereby allowing a 10 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation on the ground. The connection between nuclear war and the ozone layer is simple: the heat created by nuclear explosions produces huge quantities of nitrogen oxides in the surrounding air.25 In addition, the launch of solid-fuel missiles may release huge quantities of chlorine and nitrogen compounds. 30 These in turn, are precisely among the chemicals that could cause significant depletion of the ozone layer and lead to the two adverse consequences described above. In the first days and weeks after the war, smoke and dust will prevent the increased ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth\u2019s surface. But ozone levels will reach their nadir in 6 to 24 months, long after most of the smoke and dust have settled back to earth.2926b Ozone levels will probably be restored to above 90 percent of former levels within five years after the war.26b Hence, \u2018nuclear winter\u201d and ozone depletions are not expected to appreciably offset each other. Under the altered conditions created by a nuclear war, as many as 50 percent of the earth\u2019s species might become extinct,26c some Pest populations might temporarily increase,26d and most natural communities might undergo radical transformations.", "\n"], "id": "175c47d5c92157de7bd05eeac1eb657b0749fe5ac12ff84aa29e5afcadba1680", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 19, 26], [2, 150, 152], [3, 327, 369], [3, 387, 405], [3, 424, 465], [3, 660, 771], [3, 782, 785], [3, 807, 827], [3, 835, 841], [3, 1120, 1140], [3, 1153, 1171], [3, 1183, 1195], [3, 1209, 1225], [3, 1326, 1382], [3, 1384, 1409], [3, 1420, 1444], [3, 3157, 3352], [3, 3763, 3934], [3, 3951, 4048], [3, 4052, 4057], [3, 4067, 4070], [3, 4081, 4152], [3, 4697, 4702], [3, 4703, 4750], [3, 4763, 4817]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1950-01-01"}, {"tag": "Nuclear winter obliterates ecosystems", "cite": "John Birks, Associate Professor of Chemistry at the University of Colorado, and Anne Ehrlich, Senior Research Associate in the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, Hidden Dangers Environmental Consequences of Preparing for War, 1990, p. 135", "body": ["Each nuclear winter effect by itself\u2014sharply reduced and unpredictably fluctuating light levels and temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, air pollutants, acid deposition, radioactive fallout, and increased UV-B--would have severe consequences on many forms of life and, both directly and through differential effects on species, for ecosystems.

Herbivorous food specialists would disappear in the wake of their food-plants; their predators would also soon find slim pickings. Bees and other insects that are essential for pollination of numerous plants (including dozens of crops) would be vulnerable to cold weather, loss of light for navigation, and the failure of many plants to flower and produce nectar. Later, they could be disoriented by increased ultraviolet light, which is visible to many insects. As normal food supplies for many organisms in natural ecosystems vanished, surviving animals would soon devour whatever remained that could provide nourishment, thereby destroying seed banks, seedlings, eggs, and young animals\u2014the wellsprings of recovery. Insects and other hungry animals would also naturally turn to the most abundant source of food in target regions: crops, which probably could no longer be protected by pesticides. And human survivors, whose stored food and crops were damaged beyond use and undefendable against pests, would turn to natural ecosystems to hunt and gather whatever they could find. The organisms that would most easily survive such difficult conditions would be the \u201copportunistic\u201d species that people generally regard as pests or weeds. The combined effects of decimated seedbanks and animal populations, soils degraded by erosion, and continued abnormal weather would retard regeneration of ecosystems. The plant and animal communities that eventually appeared would be impoverished in species diversity and often dominated by undesirable opportunists\u2014very different from the natural communities of coevolved organisms they replaced. The typical consequences of destroying natural ecosystems and impairing their services to humanity would follow a nuclear war, but on a grander scale. These would include accentuated floods and droughts (in part depending on the disturbance of rainfall patterns induced by nuclear clouds), increased soil erosion, silting of streams and reservoirs, outbreaks of pests and diseases, loss of pollination services, accumulation of wastes and reduced crop yields. The ability of nature to provide sustenance and absorb abuse would be substantially reduced, just when human survivors were in dire need."], "id": "a035d0c1aba469d988ecd091185c89beab70a242819573cae47d29280690b243", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 37, 52], [2, 83, 250], [2, 353, 395], [2, 636, 699], [2, 714, 727], [2, 797, 821], [2, 834, 880], [2, 932, 960], [2, 981, 992], [2, 1022, 1027], [2, 1038, 1085], [2, 1625, 1648], [2, 1654, 1678], [2, 1719, 1741], [2, 1777, 1804], [2, 2513, 2529], [2, 2541, 2574], [2, 2583, 2596], [2, 2603, 2640], [2, 3183, 3207], [2, 3231, 3274]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[5, 10], [76, 79], [85, 92], [249, 253]], "filename": "Nuclear_Spark.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1990-01-01"}, {"tag": "Impact Turns", "cite": "Rapier 18 Robert Rapier [Chemical engineer in the energy industry, contributor to Forbes], \"Mr. President, High Oil Prices Are Actually Not That Bad For U.S. Anymore,\" Forbes, 4-20-2018 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/04/20/mr-president-high-oil-prices-are-no-longer-that-bad-for-u-s/", "body": ["Earlier today, President Trump tweeted: \"Looks like OPEC is at it again.

Of the Top 25 oil-producing states, only California, New Mexico, Colorado, and Illinois (at No. 16) voted against him. Oil country is Trump country, and I would imagine he will hear from some constituents that they like high oil prices. Rising oil prices have enabled U.S. shale oil production to rebound from the decline it suffered in 2016. Further, it isn't true that there is still record amounts of oil \"all over the place.\" A couple of years ago, global inventories were indeed at record highs. There was also a tremendous amount of oil in floating storage -- the \"fully loaded ships at sea.\" That's no longer the case. The production cuts from OPEC have reduced crude oil inventories back into a normal range. This can be seen in the most recent Oil Market Report from the International Energy Agency: Once upon a time, when the U.S. imported 10 million barrels per day of crude oil, high oil prices were a serious drag on the U.S. economy. But with U.S. net exports plummeting toward zero, this situation is changing. If the U.S. ultimately becomes a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products, then higher crude oil prices will bring more revenue into the U.S. This is a very different situation from the days when the U.S. was sending record amounts of cash overseas to purchase foreign oil. Yes, there are certain sectors that will be harmed by higher oil prices, but the net impact on the economy should start to improve as U.S. net exports increase.

Saudi Arabia could theoretically compensate for the loss of Iranian production by boosting its own supply. Yet if the effect of war is to disrupt shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, then it may be in no position to do so. Besides, Saudi is by no means averse to the current upward trajectory; it needs an $80 plus oil price just to break even fiscally on current expenditures. On the other side of the fence, an economically struggling Russia would also very much welcome a much higher oil price. Fortunately, the world economy is no longer as sensitive to oil price shocks as it used to be. Oil intensity in the global economy - the amount of oil needed to produce a single unit of output - has long been in steep decline, having fallen by more than a half in advanced economies since the 1960s. What is more, all those warnings of \u201cpeak oil\u201d - the idea that the oil would run out before alternatives are found - have turned out to be so much poppycock. The shale revolution has created an abundance of supply, such that peak world demand for oil will be reached - probably around fifteen years from now - long before the reserves begin to dwindle. The rapid advance of renewables makes it highly likely that a large part of these reserves will never be used at all. Happily, the shale revolution has in any case transformed the world\u2019s largest economy, the US, into a net beneficiary of a high oil price, a complete reversal of the position it has found itself in during previous oil price spikes. The world over, economies are weaning themselves off oil. Even so, oil still has the power to shock. The macro-economic impact of a rising oil price is both inflationary and deflationary at the same time. It raises general price inflation, and by taking money out of consumers' pockets, depresses wider economic demand. As a general rule of thumb, a 10 percent rise in the oil price knocks around 0.1 percent off global output. It doesn\u2019t sound much, and certainly the price would need to rise a lot to in itself derail the current global recovery. Nonetheless, combined with the knock to confidence from an all embracing Middle East conflict, the effect would be quite bad enough, especially on oil poor regions such as China. Yet there is also a longer term bonus to be had from higher oil prices, the effect of which is to incentivise the development of alternative sources of energy. These are coming on in leaps and bounds, such that some of them are already cheaper than traditional hydrocarbons. We are at a tipping point, where the march of renewables starts to render older forms of energy production obsolete. Oil producers should enjoy the price spike while it lasts.

A significant rise in global temperatures, combined with more severe weather conditions, more frequent floods and droughts, are bringing a paradigm shift to the way we think about our relationship with the planet. For the first time in over 150 years policy makers are thinking seriously about decreasing dependency on fossil fuels and looking for alternatives that may be more expensive in the short and medium terms, but ultimately more sustainable. 7 All of this has happened at the same time as two other, related phenomena. The first is that the global population is reaching new highs and by 2040\u201050 will total over 9 billion people. Experts predict that 85% of the world\u2019s population will be located in the developing world, which will mean a rapidly growing demand for goods and for energy. Both of these factors will result in a need to increase energy efficiency as well as find new sources of energy. What\u2019s more, this massive jump in population will coincide not only with climate change but also with increasingly difficult conditions for hydrocarbons exploration and production. As most of the world\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d oil has already been discovered, oil companies and nation states are turning to alternatives such a non\u2010conventional oil reserves (tar sands, complex fields) and reserves that in the past would have been considered unrecoverable, such as in very deep ocean waters. Furthermore, political conditions in many of the world\u2019s oil rich regions are uncertain, unstable and often unfriendly to private oil companies and to the countries of the West. Climate change and natural disasters The urgency of finding alternatives to fossil fuels has been confirmed in recent years by mounting scientific evidence that we are undergoing a noticeable anthropogenic shift in the world\u2019s weather and temperature. Not only are a range of indicators showing that the planet is warming, but the retreat of the polar ice caps, the melting of glaciers, and most importantly in the short term extreme weather conditions and increased incidence of natural disasters have highlighted the consequences of maintaining the status quo in our patterns of energy consumption and industrial development. It is estimated that we have experienced a 1 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures over the past 100 years and that by the end of the current century global temperatures may have risen by as much 7 or 8 degrees. Even with the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that is contemplated by the most ambitious mitigation strategies, global temperatures may rise by as much as 6%. This would have a dramatic and disastrous impact on both developed and developing nations and will threaten the existence of both humans and animal and plant species. Though the connection between man\u2010made greenhouse gases and global warming was denied for many years by industry and governments alike, it has now been accepted that something must be done to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.

But his national security Cabinet, which now seems to be finding its feet, is in keeping with American foreign-policy traditions. In international affairs, Trump relies on two of the leading general officers of their generation, James Mattis and H.R. McMaster;\u00a0a pillar of America\u2019s globalist-corporate establishment, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson; and the former president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, who has led a so-far-successful effort to check the mercantilist instincts of White House advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro.\u00a0The internationalists have an ally in Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and key adviser, who takes a pragmatic view of U.S. policy priorities.\u00a0For all the focus on Trump\u2019s personality, his unorthodox presidency may yield a more traditional focus on deploying American power for broader ends. Obama decried American exceptionalism, emphasized \u201cnation-building at home,\u201d and pursued a dedicated policy of retracting American power\u00a0from pivotal theaters like the Middle East,\u00a0enabling revisionist regional powers to go on the offensive. He did not do enough as the humanitarian tragedy of Syria played out in slow motion, destabilizing not only the Middle East but also Europe, dividing and weakening Washington\u2019s closest ally in world affairs.\u00a0His rhetorical \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia left U.S. allies wanting more American presence and leadership than they got.\u00a0Trump\u00a0remains at odds with much of Washington\u2019s bipartisan foreign-policy establishment. He has yet to embrace the trade leadership that makes the world\u2019s biggest economy more competitive and dynamic, and Americans more prosperous. But\u00a0his willingness to employ limited military force \u2014 including ramping up military action\u00a0against the Islamic State in Syria and Afghanistan \u2014\u00a0and to stand up to the regional power plays of revisionist states, creates opportunities to more effectively manage complex conflicts, from the Levant to the Korean Peninsula. It is telling that a modest set of missile strikes against a remote Syrian airbase represents the boldest use of American military power against the murderous regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It is also telling that the tangible threat of U.S. military action against North Korea is on the table after eight years of a policy the Obama administration termed \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d which created a window of opportunity that Pyongyang used to continue to perfect its intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons programs while America looked away. Even\u00a0China and Russia look off-balance after early fears in Washington that an inexperienced president would appease the leaders of these countries. Chinese President\u00a0Xi\u00a0Jinping\u00a0came to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate\u00a0bearing concessions\u00a0designed to fend off an American trade war. At their inaugural summit, Trump was clear with Xi that the quality of U.S.-China relations would be tied to Beijing\u2019s cooperation in tightening economic pressure on North Korea. Having secured strategic gains during the Obama presidency, and given the five-year leadership plenum approaching this fall,\u00a0Xi would be wise to exercise strategic restraint during Trump\u2019s first term, and demonstrate China\u2019s utility by tightening the pressure on its ally North Korea to deter further nuclear tests. Given that Trump wants to manage trade with what he sees as a mercantilist superpower that does not play by the rules, China would also be prudent to pursue the kind of voluntary export restraint agreements that Japan struck with the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when trade frictions with Tokyo peaked.\u00a0Trump\u2019s threat to use trade barriers\u00a0as leverage to move China to assume a tougher posture with its client in Pyongyang clearly\u00a0has gotten Beijing\u2019s attention\u00a0and may even yield dividends. Ironically, Trump is likely to be the first American president since the end of the Cold War not to pursue a \u201creset\u201d in relations with Russia. The ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russian agents of influence severely restrict the ability of this administration to pursue any kind of improvement in relations with a regime that invades democratic neighbors, threatens NATO allies with nuclear attack, attempts as a matter of state policy to subvert Western elections, and murders political opponents. Indeed, the mounting domestic opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s autocratic rule \u2014 as manifested in popular protests in cities across Russia \u2014 creates a new pressure point that the United States could leverage through a heightened force posture in Europe and more robust campaign for Russia to conform to international law by severing dealings with the outlaw Syrian regime. As Tillerson pointed out on his way to Moscow to meet Putin, Assad has become a liability rather than an asset to Russia\u2019s geopolitical ambitions.\u00a0The\u00a0Trump\u00a0administration is still in its first 100 days.

For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single preeminent successor -- not even China. International uncertainty, increased tension among global competitors, and even outright chaos would be far more likely outcomes. While a sudden, massive crisis of the American system -- for instance, another financial crisis -- would produce a fast-moving chain reaction leading to global political and economic disorder, a steady drift by America into increasingly pervasive decay or endlessly widening warfare with Islam would be unlikely to produce, even by 2025, an effective global successor. No single power will be ready by then to exercise the role that the world, upon the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, expected the United States to play: the leader of a new, globally cooperative world order. More probable would be a protracted phase of rather inconclusive realignments of both global and regional power, with no grand winners and many more losers, in a setting of international uncertainty and even of potentially fatal risks to global well-being. Rather than a world where dreams of democracy flourish, a Hobbesian world of enhanced national security based on varying fusions of authoritarianism, nationalism, and religion could ensue. The leaders of the world's second-rank powers, among them India, Japan, Russia, and some European countries, are already assessing the potential impact of U.S. decline on their respective national interests. The Japanese, fearful of an assertive China dominating the Asian mainland, may be thinking of closer links with Europe. Leaders in India and Japan may be considering closer political and even military cooperation in case America falters and China rises. Russia, while perhaps engaging in wishful thinking (even schadenfreude) about America's uncertain prospects, will almost certainly have its eye on the independent states of the former Soviet Union. Europe, not yet cohesive, would likely be pulled in several directions: Germany and Italy toward Russia because of commercial interests, France and insecure Central Europe in favor of a politically tighter European Union, and Britain toward manipulating a balance within the EU while preserving its special relationship with a declining United States. Others may move more rapidly to carve out their own regional spheres: Turkey in the area of the old Ottoman Empire, Brazil in the Southern Hemisphere, and so forth. None of these countries, however, will have the requisite combination of economic, financial, technological, and military power even to consider inheriting America's leading role. China, invariably mentioned as America's prospective successor, has an impressive imperial lineage and a strategic tradition of carefully calibrated patience, both of which have been critical to its overwhelmingly successful, several-thousand-year-long history. China thus prudently accepts the existing international system, even if it does not view the prevailing hierarchy as permanent. It recognizes that success depends not on the system's dramatic collapse but on its evolution toward a gradual redistribution of power. Moreover, the basic reality is that China is not yet ready to assume in full America's role in the world. Beijing's leaders themselves have repeatedly emphasized that on every important measure of development, wealth, and power, China will still be a modernizing and developing state several decades from now, significantly behind not only the United States but also Europe and Japan in the major per capita indices of modernity and national power. Accordingly, Chinese leaders have been restrained in laying any overt claims to global leadership. At some stage, however, a more assertive Chinese nationalism could arise and damage China's international interests. A swaggering, nationalistic Beijing would unintentionally mobilize a powerful regional coalition against itself. None of China's key neighbors -- India, Japan, and Russia -- is ready to acknowledge China's entitlement to America's place on the global totem pole. They might even seek support from a waning America to offset an overly assertive China. The resulting regional scramble could become intense, especially given the similar nationalistic tendencies among China's neighbors. A phase of acute international tension in Asia could ensue. Asia of the 21st century could then begin to resemble Europe of the 20th century -- violent and bloodthirsty. At the same time, the security of a number of weaker states located geographically next to major regional powers also depends on the international status quo reinforced by America's global preeminence -- and would be made significantly more vulnerable in proportion to America's decline. The states in that exposed position -- including Georgia, Taiwan, South Korea, Belarus, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, and the greater Middle East -- are today's geopolitical equivalents of nature's most endangered species. Their fates are closely tied to the nature of the international environment left behind by a waning America, be it ordered and restrained or, much more likely, self-serving and expansionist. A faltering United States could also find its strategic partnership with Mexico in jeopardy. America's economic resilience and political stability have so far mitigated many of the challenges posed by such sensitive neighborhood issues as economic dependence, immigration, and the narcotics trade. A decline in American power, however, would likely undermine the health and good judgment of the U.S. economic and political systems. A waning United States would likely be more nationalistic, more defensive about its national identity, more paranoid about its homeland security, and less willing to sacrifice resources for the sake of others' development. The worsening of relations between a declining America and an internally troubled Mexico could even give rise to a particularly ominous phenomenon: the emergence, as a major issue in nationalistically aroused Mexican politics, of territorial claims justified by history and ignited by cross-border incidents. Another consequence of American decline could be a corrosion of the generally cooperative management of the global commons -- shared interests such as sea lanes, space, cyberspace, and the environment, whose protection is imperative to the long-term growth of the global economy and the continuation of basic geopolitical stability. In almost every case, the potential absence of a constructive and influential U.S. role would fatally undermine the essential communality of the global commons because the superiority and ubiquity of American power creates order where there would normally be conflict. None of this will necessarily come to pass. Nor is the concern that America's decline would generate global insecurity, endanger some vulnerable states, and produce a more troubled North American neighborhood an argument for U.S. global supremacy. In fact, the strategic complexities of the world in the 21st century make such supremacy unattainable. But those dreaming today of America's collapse would probably come to regret it. And as the world after America would be increasingly complicated and chaotic, it is imperative that the United States pursue a new, timely strategic vision for its foreign policy -- or start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.", ""], "id": "45047ae3e2284883b18c38cfde4b719eb9cd10abcee7ade5388e0f7925aed5b5", "highlighted_text": "if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a successor International uncertainty , increased tension among global competitors, and chaos would be likely a sudden, massive crisis of the American system would produce a fast-moving chain reaction leading to global political and economic disorder The resulting regional scramble could become intense, especially given the similar nationalistic tendencies among China's neighbors Another consequence could be a corrosion of the generally cooperative management of the global commons -- shared interests such as sea lanes, space, cyberspace, and the environment, whose protection is imperative to the long-term growth of the global economy and the continuation of basic geopolitical stability", "highlights": [[2, 410, 472], [2, 491, 500], [2, 520, 545], [2, 545, 546], [2, 547, 564], [2, 565, 594], [2, 609, 614], [2, 615, 623], [2, 633, 639], [2, 656, 703], [2, 749, 841], [2, 4573, 4704], [2, 6552, 6571], [2, 6592, 6883]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 245], [2, 406, 409], [2, 410, 472], [2, 473, 490], [2, 491, 500], [2, 501, 518], [2, 518, 519], [2, 520, 545], [2, 545, 546], [2, 547, 564], [2, 565, 594], [2, 595, 599], [2, 600, 608], [2, 609, 614], [2, 615, 623], [2, 624, 632], [2, 633, 639], [2, 640, 655], [2, 656, 703], [2, 704, 748], [2, 749, 841], [2, 841, 842], [2, 843, 1077], [2, 1226, 1389], [2, 1390, 1484], [2, 1674, 1881], [2, 2686, 2754], [2, 2756, 3030], [2, 3593, 3661], [2, 3663, 3940], [2, 4129, 4484], [2, 4485, 4571], [2, 4571, 4572], [2, 4573, 4704], [2, 4704, 4705], [2, 4706, 4875], [2, 5588, 6019], [2, 6552, 6571], [2, 6572, 6591], [2, 6592, 6883], [2, 6883, 7052], [2, 7053, 7153], [2, 7509, 7585], [2, 7586, 7592], [2, 7593, 7834]], "emphasis": [[2, 410, 472], [2, 473, 490], [2, 491, 500], [2, 501, 518], [2, 520, 545], [2, 547, 564], [2, 600, 608], [2, 609, 614], [2, 656, 703], [2, 749, 841], [2, 1390, 1484], [2, 4573, 4704], [2, 4704, 4705], [2, 6552, 6571], [2, 6572, 6591], [2, 6592, 6883], [2, 7053, 7153], [2, 7593, 7834]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 13]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-03"}, {"tag": "Hegemonic transition wars are highly probable and cause extinction.", "cite": "Chase-Dunn and Podobnik 95 [Christopher Chase-Dunn, and Bruce Podobnik. \"The next world war: world-system cycles and trends.\"\u00a0Journal of World-Systems Research\u00a01.1 (1995): 295-326.]//SJ", "body": ["This essay places the contemporary period of global development in long-run historical perspective, elaborates a model of world-system cycles and trends, and discusses the main structural forces influencing the probability of future war among core powers. The possible continuation of the cycle of hegemonic rivalry is discussed in terms of the similarities and differences between the coming three decades and earlier periods in which a declining hegemon was challenged by upwardly mobile states. Possible bids for economic and political hegemony by Japan, Germany, China and the United States are discussed, as are the possibilities for different coalitions in East Asia and Europe. The phenomenon of bloc formation is discussed in a long-term perspective that includes earlier periods of colonial empire and \"commonwealth.\" We conclude that there is a significantly high probability that warfare among core states could occur in the 2020s. The prospects for global state formation within the next three decades are considered. We recommend a combination of the build-up of U.N. peace-keeping forces and the continuation of U.S. military strength as the least worst and most feasible solution to the problem of avoiding nuclear holocaust in the 2020s. The continuing globalization of the world capitalist system, and, more recently, the apparent triumph of global liberalism following the collapse or restructuring of most socialist states, have led a number of scholars to claim that a fundamentally new era has begun in which economic rather than military competition will become the sole basis of geopolitics (e.g. Fukuyama, 1992). While assorted regional bloodbaths (as in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda, and Chechnya) will, of course, continue to occur, unrivaled U.S. military dominance, the strengthening of international institutions, and the continuing consolidation of a world capitalist class are all seen as promoting peace and stability within the core of the world-system. For many contemporary analysts, therefore, it appears to be increasingly unlikely that an all-out shooting war among core states will occur in the future. Certain new and historically-unique characteristics of the contemporary era are frequently cited as serving to dampen military conflict among core powers. The existence of weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear, biological, chemical, and unknown possible future variants) have led some scholars to argue that the very idea of core warfare has become obsolete, as it implies the total destruction of the contending states and probably most of the world. Keohane (1984:49) and Goldstein and Rapkin (1991:957), for example, independently conclude that while U.S. hegemony will continue to decline, no rising contender will be willing to risk nuclear annihilation by undertaking a military bid for dominance. Instead of the traditional pattern of hegemonic transition, in which one core power emerges victorious from a world war, these scholars foresee the gradual consolidation of international institutions with the capability of coordinating a multipolar, \"post-hegemonic\" world.", ""], "id": "0c9e32a112568d840e13d22870cdde4d29ababcf0632205f728cbea65295cf12", "highlighted_text": "there is a significantly high probability warfare among core states could occur in the 2020s . most feasible solution to the problem of avoiding nuclear holocaust in the 2020s . regional bloodbaths will occur an all-out shooting war among core states will occur in the future one core power emerges victorious from a world war", "highlights": [[2, 844, 854], [2, 855, 885], [2, 891, 916], [2, 917, 922], [2, 923, 941], [2, 941, 942], [2, 1172, 1221], [2, 1222, 1252], [2, 1252, 1253], [2, 1652, 1671], [2, 1741, 1745], [2, 1770, 1775], [2, 2092, 2158], [2, 2942, 2980], [2, 2981, 2992]], "underlines": [[2, 168, 255], [2, 285, 328], [2, 436, 496], [2, 498, 598], [2, 621, 634], [2, 827, 843], [2, 844, 854], [2, 855, 885], [2, 886, 890], [2, 891, 916], [2, 917, 922], [2, 923, 941], [2, 941, 942], [2, 1172, 1221], [2, 1222, 1252], [2, 1643, 1651], [2, 1652, 1671], [2, 1739, 1740], [2, 1741, 1745], [2, 1745, 1769], [2, 1770, 1775], [2, 1775, 1776], [2, 1787, 1810], [2, 1816, 1859], [2, 1880, 1921], [2, 2048, 2077], [2, 2080, 2086], [2, 2087, 2091], [2, 2092, 2158], [2, 2158, 2159], [2, 2313, 2545], [2, 2546, 2619], [2, 2723, 2761], [2, 2766, 2871], [2, 2884, 2931], [2, 2942, 2980], [2, 2981, 2992]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 26]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1995-01-01"}, {"tag": "Foreign military aid is key to US power projection\u2014countries we abandon will turn to Russia and China", "cite": "Goure 16", "body": ["Daniel Goure, Ph.D. \u201cForeign Military Sales Remain An Important Tool Of U.S. National Security.\u201d Lexington Institute. February 26, 2016. https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/foreign-military-sales-remain-an-important-tool-of-u-s-national-security/", "As still the world\u2019s sole superpower, the United States possesses an unequaled array of instruments to support its foreign and defense strategies. With so much attention being focused on the conflicts in the Middle East, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and Chinese efforts to assert its hegemony in the Western Pacific, the fact that the United States employs a wide range of non-military, or at least non-kinetic tools in pursuing its national interests is lost. Most recently, for example, the United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade sanctions on North Korea in response to that country\u2019s test of a long-range ballistic missile. One of the most important of these tools is foreign military sales (FMS). The complex role of FMS is reflected, in part, in the fact that the program is run by the Department of State and not the Department of Defense. One reason for this unusual management approach is that the FMS program involves sales by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign governments. As a result, such sales reflect the views of the U.S. government with respect to the recipient country, its relationships with others in the region and the overall approach this country takes to mitigating the threat of regional or global conflict. The FMS program serves many other purposes. The sales of U.S. arms and related items to foreign countries helps reduce the cost of those systems to our own military. FMS sales help to ensure the ability of U.S. allies to defend themselves and support the maintenance of stable regional military balances. Equally important, FMS sales over time establish enduring relationships between foreign governments and their militaries and the U.S. When the U.S. military trains alongside those of allies equipped with the same hardware, it helps to cement the bonds between our countries. Moreover, it improves communications and understanding among these militaries, often helping to inculcate U.S. values related to the use of military force. Foreign militaries dependent on access to U.S. hardware, spare parts, software upgrades and training are more likely to listen to this country when there is a dispute regarding regional politics or defense issues. FMS has been particularly important as an instrument for influencing foreign governments and shaping regional balances of power in the Middle East. Following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the United States completely reequipped the Egyptian military. The Egyptian-Israeli border has been remarkably stable ever since. Sales of military aircraft, missile defense systems and precision munitions to the nations of the Persian Gulf have been instrumental in ensuring a stable balance of forces in that area. Pakistan has been a recipient of U.S. arms. FMS sales have been extremely important to U.S. efforts to ensure Pakistan\u2019s reliability as an ally in the war on terror. Congress has appropriated about $3.6 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Pakistan since 2001. The kind of equipment provided ranges from radios, transport aircraft and unmanned systems to F-16 fighters. Recently, the State Department approved the sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan. Pakistan intends to use these aircraft in its fight against domestic terrorists. The U.S. and other regional allies have found the F-16 to be an effective platform for conducting precision strikes against terrorist targets. In addition, India is pursuing a major Air Force modernization program. The sale of F-16s to Pakistan would help to maintain the balance of power in the subcontinent. Unfortunately, Senator Rand Paul has filed a Joint Resolution of Disapproval for this sale, something that hasn\u2019t happened since the 1980s. The effort to block this sale is a mistake. It will serve only to weaken the relationship between our two countries even as the fight against the Taliban continues and intensifies in Afghanistan. In addition, it leaves the way open for Pakistan to acquire aircraft from other suppliers, such as China or Russia.

They begin by describing the all-important process of\u00a0photosynthesis, by which the earth's plants \"convert light energy into chemical energy, which is used in the assimilation of atmospheric CO2\u00a0and the formation of sugars that fuel growth and yield,\" which phenomena make this natural and life-sustaining process, in their words, \"a major target for improving crop productivity both via conventional breeding and biotechnology.\" Next to a plant's need for carbon dioxide comes its need for\u00a0water, the availability of which, in the words of Parry and Hawkesford, \"is the major constraint on world crop productivity.\" And they state that \"since more than 80% of the [world's] available water is used for agricultural production, there is little opportunity to use additional water for crop production, especially because as populations increase, the demand to use water for other activities also increases.\" Hence, they rightly conclude that \"a real and immediate challenge for agriculture is to increase crop production with less available water.\" Enlarging upon this challenge, they give an example of a\u00a0success story: the Australian wheat variety 'Drysdale', which gained its fame \"because it uses water more efficiently.\" This valued characteristic is achieved \"by slightly restricting stomatal aperture and thereby the loss of water from the leaves.\" They note, however, that this ability \"reduces photosynthetic performance slightly under ideal conditions,\" but they say it enables plants to \"have access to water later in the growing season thereby increasing total photosynthesis over the life of the crop.\" Of course, Drysdale is but\u00a0one\u00a0variety of\u00a0one\u00a0crop; and the ideal goal would be to get nearly\u00a0all\u00a0varieties of\u00a0all\u00a0crops to use water more efficiently. And that goal can actually be reached by\u00a0doing nothing, by merely halting the efforts of radical environmentalists to deny earth's\u00a0carbon-based life forms\u00a0-- that's all of us and the rest of the earth's plants and animals -- the extra carbon we and they\u00a0need\u00a0to live our lives to the fullest. This is because allowing the air's CO2content to rise in response to the burning of fossil fuels\u00a0naturally\u00a0causes the vast majority of earth's plants to progressively reduce the apertures of their stomata and thereby lower the rate at which water escapes through them to the air. And the result is even better than that produced by the breeding of Drysdale, because the extra CO2\u00a0in the airmore than overcomes\u00a0the photosynthetic reduction that results from the partial closure of plant stomatal apertures, allowing even\u00a0more\u00a0yield to be produced per unit of water transpired in the process. Yet man can make the situation better still, by breeding and selecting crop varieties that perform better under higher atmospheric CO2\u00a0concentrations than the varieties we currently rely upon, or he can employ various technological means of altering them to do so. Truly,\u00a0we can succeed, even where \"the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of substantially reducing the world's hungry by 2015 will not be met,\" as Parry and Hawkesford accurately inform us.

Selection of leaves from a plant at different node positions provided us with leaves that differed in age, and the leaves at same node in different treatments enabled us to study the effect of different intensities of UV-B radiation and [CO2 ] on leaves of the same age. In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. DES119), Sassenrath-Cole et al. (1996) found that changes in leaf photosynthetic responses to light environment during leaf ageing were solely as a result of physiological changes within the senescing leaf and not the result of photon flux density environment or shading. Decline in photosynthesis and chlorophyll are early symptoms of senescence, with chloroplasts as one of the primary targets for degradation (Thomas and Stoddart 1980, Grove and Mohanty 1992). In cotton, remobilization of leaf N to reproductive organs appears to be the principle component leading to photosynthetic decline (Pettigrew et al. 2000) and the data also suggest that environmental factors can play a role in causing the photosynthetic decline. In our study, atmospheric [CO2 ] did not alter the senescence as indicated by Pn and chlorophyll pigments. Elevated [CO2 ], however, increased Pn by 35% similar to that recorded in earlier studies in well-watered and well fertilized conditions (Reddy et al. 1997, 2000). In this study, at 0 kJ of UV-B and with increase in leafage, a decrease in Pn was recorded with no change in chlorophyll pigments indicating that decline in Pn is a stimulant for leaf senescence in cotton. The photosynthesis activity below a certain threshold level is known to induce leaf senescence (Smart 1994, Dai et al. 1999). Hensel et al. (1993) postulated that a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency reduces sugar levels that may be an early signal for induction of senescence. In the current study, near ambient UV-B radiation (7.7 kJ) reduced the Pn of30day-old leaves by 50% compared with that at 0 kJ UV-B radiation. In detached maize leaves, senescence induced loss of chlorophyll and photosynthesis was significantly enhanced by UV-B radiation (Biswal et al. 1997). Under high UV-B of15.1 kJ, the 12-day-old leaves had Pn on par with the 30-day-old leaves in the control treatment.

It is an important cash crop, major source of foreign exchange and plays an important role in agriculture, industry and economic development of the country. In Pakistan cotton is grown on an area is 3.22 million hectares with total production of 12417 thousand bales and average seed cotton yield of 732 kg ha -1 (Anonymous, 2007). Despite of concerted efforts of breeders and agronomists, yield per unit area is still far below from many other cotton producing countries of the world. Low yield of cotton in Pakistan is attributed to some production as well as economic constraints. Poor quality seed, low seed rate, low plant population, poor management or agronomic practices, conventional sowing methods, imbalanced fertilizer application, weed infestation and insect attack are main causes of its low yield. In cotton plant, spacing has effects on the growth and yield characteristics of the plant. Plant population (density) is very important for attaining optimum crop growth and yield under irrigated conditions. Mostly, farmers maintain plant spacing and density according to their traditional methods of planting rather than variety requirement and hence do not obtain the high crop yield. Hussain et al. (2000) reported that 30 cm spacing between cotton plants increased plant height, number of bolls per plant and boll weight as compared to 10 cm and 20 cm. However, plant spacing did not affect ginning out turn or fiber quality. On the other hand Muhammad et al. (2002) found that boll weight decreased by increasing plant population. The field conditions that produce short stature plants can generally tolerate higher plant density without incurring significant yield reduction (Hake et al., 1991). Adequate plant population facilitates the efficient use of applied fertilizers and irrigation (Abbas, 2000). When density is low, fruiting branches are longer and a greater percentage of bolls are produced on outer position of fruiting branches but first position bolls produced by high density are the biggest and best resulting in high yield. Fruit initiation was influenced by plant density in upland cotton (Buxton et al., 1977).\n"], "id": "bd174df40744577276fc749c0b3ffbe0f591e899b67bf96b4e8f824feb8e9180", "highlighted_text": "Cotton is considered as mainstay of Pakistan\u2019s economy.

If we all remain determined to increase our living standards, our level of production and consumption, in a world where resources are already scarce, where only a few have affluent living standards but another 8 billion will be wanting them too, and which we, the rich, are determined to get richer without any limit, then nothing is more guaranteed than that there will be increasing levels of conflict and violence. To put it another way, if we insist on remaining affluent we will need to remain heavily armed. Increased conflict in at least the following categories can be expected. First, the present conflict over resources between the rich elites and the poor majority in the Third World must increase, for example, as \u2018development\u2019 under globalisation takes more land, water and forests into export markets. Second, there are conflicts between the Third World and the rich world, the major recent examples being the war between the US and Iraq over control of oil. Iraq invaded Kuwait and the US intervened, accompanied by much high-sounding rhetoric (having found nothing unacceptable about Israel\u2019s invasions of Lebanon or the Indonesian invasion of East Timor). As has often been noted, had Kuwait been one of the world\u2019s leading exporters of broccoli, rather than oil, it is doubtful whether the US would have been so eager to come to its defence. At the time of writing, the US is at war in Central Asia over \u2018terrorism\u2019. Few would doubt that a \u2018collateral\u2019 outcome will be the establishment of regimes that will give the West access to the oil wealth of Central Asia. Following are some references to the connection many have recognised between rich world affluence and conflict. General M.D. Taylor, US Army retired argued \u2018... US military priorities just be shifted towards insuring a steady flow of resources from the Third World\u2019. Taylor referred to \u2018\u2026 fierce competition among industrial powers for the same raw materials markets sought by the United States\u2019 and \u2018\u2026 growing hostility displayed by have-not nations towards their affluent counterparts\u2019.62 \u2018Struggles are taking place, or are in the offing, between rich and poor nations over their share of the world product; within the industrial world over their share of industrial resources and markets\u2019.63 \u2018That more than half of the people on this planet are poorly nourished while a small percentage live in historically unparalleled luxury is a sure recipe for continued and even escalating international conflict.\u201964 The oil embargo placed on the US by OPEC in the early 1970s prompted the US to make it clear that it was prepared to go to war in order to secure supplies. \u2018President Carter last week issued a clear warning that any attempt to gain control of the Persian Gulf would lead to war.\u2019 It would \u2018\u2026 be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States\u2019.65 \u2018The US is ready to take military action if Russia threatens vital American interests in the Persian Gulf, the US Secretary of Defence, Mr Brown, said yesterday.\u201966 Klare\u2019s recent book Resource Wars discusses this theme in detail, stressing the coming significance of water as a source of international conflict. \u2018Global demand for many key materials is growing at an unsustainable rate. \u2026 the incidence of conflict over vital materials is sure to grow. \u2026 The wars of the future will largely be fought over the possession and control of vital economic goods. \u2026 resource wars will become, in the years ahead, the most distinctive feature of the global security environment.\u201967 Much of the rich world\u2019s participation in the conflicts taking place throughout the world is driven by the determination to back a faction that will then look favourably on Western interests. In a report entitled, \u2018The rich prize that is Shaba\u2019, Breeze begins, \u2018Increasing rivalry over a share-out between France and Belgium of the mineral riches of Shaba Province lies behind the joint Franco\u2013 Belgian paratroop airlift to Zaire. \u2026 These mineral riches make the province a valuable prize and help explain the West\u2019s extended diplomatic courtship \u2026\u201968 Then there is potential conflict between the rich nations who are after all the ones most dependent on securing large quantities of resources. \u2018The resource and energy intensive modes of production employed in nearly all industries necessitate continuing armed coercion and competition to secure raw materials.\u201969 \u2018Struggles are taking place, or are in the offing, between rich and poor nations over their share of the world product, within the industrial world over their share of industrial resources and markets \u2026\u201970 Growth, competition, expansion \u2026 and war Finally, at the most abstract level, the struggle for greater wealth and power is central in the literature on the causes of war. \u2018\u2026 warfare appears as a normal and periodic form of competition within the capitalist world economy. \u2026 world wars regularly occur during a period of economic expansion. \u201971 \u2018War is an inevitable result of the struggle between economies for expansion.\u201972 Choucri and North say their most important finding is that domestic growth is a strong determinant of national expansion and that this results in competition between nations and war.73 The First and Second World Wars can be seen as being largely about imperial grabbing. Germany, Italy and Japan sought to expand their territory and resource access. Britain already held much of the world within its empire \u2026 which it had previously fought 72 wars to take! \u2018Finite resources in a world of expanding populations and increasing per capita demands create a situation ripe for international violence.\u201974 Ashley focuses on the significance of the quest for economic growth. \u2018War is mainly explicable in terms of differential growth in a world of scarce and unevenly distributed resources \u2026 expansion is a prime source of conflict. So long as the dynamics of differential growth remain unmanaged, it is probable that these long term processes will sooner or later carry major powers into war.\u201975 Security The point being made can be put in terms of security. One way to seek security is to develop greater capacity to repel attack. In the case of nations this means large expenditure of money, resources and effort on military preparedness. However there is a much better strategy; i.e. to live in ways that do not oblige you to take more than your fair share and therefore that do not give anyone any motive to attack you. Tut! This is not possible unless there is global economic justice. If a few insist on levels of affluence, industrialisation and economic growth that are totally impossible for all to achieve, and which could not be possible if they were taking only their fair share of global resources, then they must remain heavily armed and their security will require readiness to use their arms to defend their unjust privileges. In other words, if we want affluence we must prepare for war.

This is when world wars have occurred in the past. Intensified rivalry and competition for raw materials and markets will coincide with a multipolar distribution of military power among core states. The world-system model does not predict who the next hegemon will be. Rather it designates that there will be structural forces in motion that will favor the construction of a new hierarchy. Historical particularities and the unique features of the era will shape the outcome and select the winners and losers. If it were possible for the current system to survive the holocaust of another war among core states, the outcome of the war would be the main arbiter of hegemonic succession. While the hegemonic sequence has been a messy method of selecting global \"leadership\" in the past, the settlement of hegemonic rivalry by force in the future will be a disaster that our species may not survive. It is my concern about this possible disaster that motivates this effort to understand how the hegemonic sequence has occurred in the past and the factors affecting hegemonic rivalry in the next decades. What are the cyclical processes and secular trends that may affect the probability of future world wars? The world-system model is presented in Figure 1. This model depicts the variables that I contend will be the main influences on the probability of war among core states. The four variables that raise the probability of core war are the Kondratieff cycle, hegemonic decline, population pressure (and resource scarcity) and global inequality. The four variables that reduce the probability of core war are the destructiveness of weaponry, international economic interdependency, international political integration and disarmament. The probability of war may be high without a war occurring, of course. Joshua Goldstein's (1988) study of war severity (battle deaths per year) in wars among the \"great powers\" demonstrated the existence of a fifty-year cycle of core wars. Goldstein's study shows how this \"war wave\" tracks rather closely with the Kondratieff long economic cycle over the past 500 years of world-system history. It is the future of this war cycle that I am trying to predict. Factors that Increase the Likelihood of War Among Core States The proposed model divides variables into those that are alleged to increase the probability of war among core states and those that decrease that probability. There are four of each. Kondratieff waves The first variable that has a positive effect on the probability of war among core powers is the Kondratieff wave -- a forty to sixty year cycle of economic growth and stagnation. Goldstein (1988) provides evidence that the most destructive core wars tend to occur late in a Kondratieff A-phase (upswing). Earlier research by Thompson and Zuk (1982) also supports the conclusion that core wars are more likely to begin near the end of an upswing. Boswell and Sweat's (1991) analysis also supports the Goldstein thesis. But several other world-system theorists have argued that core wars occur primarily during K-wave B-phases. This disagreement over timing is related to a disagreement over causation. According to Goldstein states are war machines that always have a desire to utilize military force, but wars are costly and so statesmen tend to refrain from going to war when state revenues are low. On the other hand, statesmen are more likely to engage in warfare when state revenues are high (because the states can then afford the high costs of war). Boswell and Sweat call this the \"resource theory of war.\" "], "id": "8675d88d0c21752119a2f415108c5753605b2864e2976641384065fdc82bc901", "highlighted_text": "upswing the 2020s), the system predicts world war.

All the mumbo-jumbo about being the \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cindispensable\u201d nation, the natural \u201cleader\u201d of something called the \u201cWest,\u201d the guarantor of some kind of international system of \u201crules\u201d is finally being cast into the dustbin of history. This moment is not just about leaving the Iran nuclear agreement, or even the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement. It is not simply attributable to the unpredictable, childish impulses of the current president. Nor is it the result of Obama\u2019s failure to enforce a red line in Syria, or \u201cleading from behind\u201d in Libya. It is not even about Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq with the goal of regime change, setting in motion the destruction of what little political stability existed in the Middle East. Of course, it is about all these decisions. But in every case, those decisions, and even the critics of those decisions, have failed to realize how they have played into, helped cause, and now accelerate a fundamental shift in global realities\u2014the centrifugal redistribution of power and influence in the international system that has brought to an end the \u201cAmerican century.\u201d The United States has become just another power in a system for which it no longer sets or enforces the rules, if it ever really did. Both political parties fail to cope with this reality. Democrats and liberals insist that Trump\u2019s foreign-policy decisions threaten the \u201crules-based\u201d international order America built and dominated. A simple change in leadership, they believe, can restore order and America\u2019s primacy. Republicans  bellicose American assertiveness, believing that force and military strength guarantee that the world will behave. Columnists bewail America\u2019s declining status,  that greater iinvestment in allies and diplomacy, combined with military engagement might reverse the tide. Think tanks scurry to  new national security and military policies that can put America back on top. This debate is a circular firing squad. Both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are struggling to recreate a myth: that the US dominates the world by dint of power, values, wisdom, even God\u2019s decisions. America, and only America, can bring order and security to the world. Any other option spells chaos. Power Shifts The latest foreign policy whim\u2014withdrawing from the nuclear agreement with Iran\u2014is the most recent nail in the coffin lid in which the myth is buried. Rather than restore leadership, withdrawing from the agreement simply accelerates the global rebalancing already underway, a tectonic shift that began with the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The signs are everywhere. In the Middle East, the power shift is palpable. The United States has treated Iran as a pariah since 1979, trying to stuff the ayatollahs back into some imaginary bottle, hoping that they will go away or be overthrown. This approach has failed, and the withdrawal from the nuclear deal will only make that failure more evident. Iran is a regional power, defending its interests, engaging other powers and movements inside and outside the region, such as Russia. US regime change in Iraq not only destabilized the region but helped usher the Iranians into this active regional role. The other influential countries in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel, will have to deal with this reality. In addition to these three countries, Russia is also key to regional stability and instability. There\u2019s no way of pushing the Russians out, short of direct conflict. Nor can Turkey be forced to comply with American policy. It is clearly asserting its own interests and influence in three directions at the same time: Central Asia and Russia, Europe, and the Middle East. The invasion of Iraq may have helped open this Pandora\u2019s box. The US is rapidly becoming a marginal player in the chaotic security environment of the Middle East. In Asia, decades of US condemnation and containment of China have failed. How dare China rise? How dare China steal intellectual property, stifle democracy, arm its artificial islands in the South China Sea, develop a powerful military, mess in Africa (complete with a military base in Djibouti), and intrude into Latin America? And yet, to paraphrase Galileo, \u201cthey move.\u201d There is a new, global, competitive player in the system, a reality the United States can not contain or reverse. That player is disrupting that lovely system of rules, acting without U.S. permission or approval. It is even creating new international institutions\u2014an infrastructure development bank and a global trading infrastructure programs (the Belt and Road initiative) to which the US is not even a party. The balance has changed, permanently, and the rules are being rewritten, whether the United States likes it or not. At the end of the Cold War, American power surrounded Russia, coopting its former satellites, provoking a Russian reaction. Today, the Russian government is, poisoning its citizens overseas, arming Assad, intruding on elections globally, stifling dissent and killing dissenters, and rebuilding its military. Confront Russia, condemn Putin, pretend that they are isolated, treat them with contempt and moral judgment, but Putin does not go away. He is asserting his view of Russia\u2019s interests and Russia\u2019s role in the world, like any great power is likely to do. No amount of US pressure, sanctions, or policy is likely to change that reality. Russia is consciously and actively rebalancing the United States, with some success. American bullying and presidential rhetoric may have played a role in the apparent, but uncertain, willingness of the North Korean regime to put its nuclear program on the table. But if that program disappears, the putative Nobel Peace Prize may actually belong to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and even Kim Jong Un, for seizing an opportunity. Even that regional balance and the key players are shifting. Reckoning with the Shift America has not been able to use its dominant military to prevent this evolution or restore order. Where it has been deployed in large numbers\u2014Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014U.S. military force has failed. War grinds on [in] Afghanistan with no light suddenly appearing at the end of the tunnel, despite the promises of generations of officers. Rousting the Islamic State from Iraq has not solved the internal problems of that unhappy country, which is still recovering from a US occupation. Special Operations forces in dozens of countries whack at terrorist moles only to find others arising in their place, stimulated by the confrontation. Order is not restored; the American rules are not being obeyed. If the US fails to read global rebalancing accurately and tries either to bully the rest of the world or to \u201crestore\u201d the liberal international order, the entire world will find itself at an even more dangerous moment. Bullying will only accelerate the centrifugal trend. Asserting the superiority of an American \u201corder\u201d and American \u201crules\u201d will no longer persuade other rising powers. The rules will change with the rebalancing. Eliminating the Trump presidency will not restore the previous order. His actions are not an aberration, but an accelerant, spreading the fires that were already under way. The challenge is to completely redesign US foreign and national security policy to fit with a world where America is just another power, competing and cooperating for influence. The United States must learn to play well with others in the global sandbox.", ""], "id": "a65b18e1e0928bf4a522b32569178afa5bca69aa27c3e8a4cd508e140d0c4492", "highlighted_text": "America is experiencing a historic turning point leaving the Iran nuclear agreement the T P P and Paris accelerate a fundamental shift in global realities that has brought to an end the \u201cAmerican century . \u201d The United States has become just another power Republicans bellicose American assertiveness This debate is a circular firing squad Any option spells chaos. withdrawing from Iran\u2014is the most recent nail in the coffin lid in which the myth is buried.

For some, the last year reflects the end of the American century; for others, the combination of the Trump ad- ministration and Brexit suggests the demise of over two centuries of Anglo-American global leadership. In short, disorienting developments across the Atlantic in the last year have triggered questions about the stability and sustainability of an international order premised on a particular brand of American imperium. We argue that while the Trump administration has certainly broken with the decorum and diplomacy of past American presidential policies, the unraveling of the international order put in place under American leadership in the postwar period has been more than a quarter century in the making. The postwar order that replaced the age of empires was one that reflected the American constitutional imagination and marked a break from the earlier era of formal colonial dependencies. By contrast with its predecessor, the American-led order, grounded in constitutional principles, had two international components. The first was a commitment to spreading market-based capitalist democracy and its correlate, liberal constitutionalism, through American bilateral and multilateral foreign policy.2 The second was support for a rule-based international order that was understood as an extension of the American constitutional imagination to the challenges of global governance. Indeed, the post-war liberal international regime represented a clear expression of American constitutionalism from the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (tied eventually to an \"International Bill of Rights\") and the UN Charter (a \"constitution\" for world order), to the creation of a tight web of interlocking institutions governing everything from international monetary policy and global trade to health, education, and scientific cooperation. As a consequence, the United States served as a global hegemon in a multilateral framework whose legitimacy depended on legality and a kind of international social contract that would command consensual participation from the international community, albeit in a system that still preserved asymmetric benefits for its author.3 And during the Cold War, as the self-styled leader of the \"free world,\" America and its commitments to legality and capitalist democracy were contrasted with the authoritarian control economies of the Soviet sphere. In this Essay, we explore the degree to which the version of American empire that characterized the postwar project has given way to competing commitments and preferences that have ultimately eroded basic faith at home and abroad in constitutionalism itself. The Cold War period was no doubt filled with gross violations of international legality, antidemocratic overthrows, and support for American-aligned dictatorships. Indeed, in many ways the defining feature of American Cold War power was the degree to which the promotion of liberal constitutionalism in actuality produced coercion and widespread violence on the ground. And as we suggest below, America's departures from its own presumptive constitutional values were in truth not defections at all. They were instead hard baked into the very structure of how American policymakers attempted to marry universal claims with efforts to project power, often on highly racialized terms. This means that the vision of American imperium that marked the Cold War was always an unstable one, cyclically breaking down under the internal weight of its own inherent contradictions. But crucially, even in the context of these tensions \u2013 such as during the Vietnam War \u2013 the persistent tendency of policymakers was to revive and defend the ideology of American imperium. The destructive consequences of US power were justified, time and again, either as aberrations necessitated by the imperatives of anticommunism or unfortunate transitional developments on the way to full-fledged liberal democracy. Perhaps most critically, despite these real and damaging consequences, the requirements of offering a credible alternative to the Soviet example pressed American officials to invest in developmental and reconstructive efforts as well as multilateral institutions that highlighted the compatibility of the American model with foreign prosperity and mutual constraint. In this way, the default American postwar order not only remained wedded to constitutional liberal democracy in its self-presentation. Especially during the heady postwar years of American economic largesse, it also embodied a plausible account both at home and abroad of shared economic and political security.4 These characteristics of the postwar order were further manifest in what Professor Samuel Huntington memorably framed as the \"waves of democratization\" that spread through the international system.5 The end of World War II was marked by American assistance to help postfascist Western European states resurrect market democracies. Postcolonial independence brought a wave of new states that embraced constitutions-along with flags and anthems-as markers of self-determination.6 Joining international human-rights treaties became a rite of passage as states gained sovereignty and entered the United Nations. In later waves, countries emerging from military rule in Latin America and postcommunist reforms in Eastern Europe appeared to confirm the transnational spread of constitutional democracy as an incident of American-led international order. This meant that for all the profound violence and real democracy demotion of the Cold War years, liberal constitutionalism as a \"default design choice\"7 did diffuse broadly in the decades following World War II. While this earlier era of democratization depended on many factors, this diffusion was facilitated, on our account, by the background conditions of multilateral order and the presentation of constitutional democracy as the legitimate domestic political order for countries maintaining good standing in the American-led \"free world.\" Although it was viewed as a system without ideological competitors by the end of the Cold War, this seemingly \"default\" framework nonetheless depended on American commitments that underwrote the postwar international order. While the decline of liberal constitutionalism may be tied to numerous factors, the gradual American retreat from its own international and domestic model has surely played a role. During the Cold War, American leaders commonly regarded the constraints of international institutions as conducive to entrenching the nation's hegemony. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fact of unipolarity seemed to remove many of the external pressures that had previously connected national self-interest to international legal restraint.8 Moreover, in the absence of an alternative model as a foil against which the United States proclaimed its democratic commitments, other strategic priorities gained salience. In particular, counterterrorism and the national security state became increasingly central to American governance imperatives. In the very regions where American analysts awaited the arrival of a \"fourth wave\" of democracy \u2013 notably the Muslim world \u2013 these new imperatives not only displaced constitutional priorities but were in many cases in direct tension with them.9 Certainly, during the Cold War there had always been a tension between democratization and anticommunism, leading to the support of pliable dictatorships.o But in the post-World War II years, such support was presented as transitional or as still bound to a narrative of shared economic growth that would in time generate liberal democratic regimes. However, with the Muslim world styled as an incubator of terrorist threat and a general American retreat from the domestic and international welfarist policies that marked the early Cold War, the United States increasingly moved simply to consolidate executive power abroad.11 This consolidation persisted without any plausible account of political transition or collective economic improvement- and despite half-hearted invocations of \"democracy promotion.\" In essence, the Cold War's coercive security means became increasingly disconnected from any credible aspirational ends. In some ways, the Trump administration represents the apotheosis of these broad international and transnational trends. The Cold War era had been marked by a persistent cycle in which American policymakers elaborated a framework of constitutional values and norms only to see those norms break down in political practice. But the post-Cold War era culminating in Trump has now seemingly ended the cycle. It has produced a final collapse of commitment to the values themselves and, thus, of the basic justifications for American imperium.12 At the domestic level, the president shows little deference to constitutional norms at home-decrying judicial independence when it undermines executive fiat's and setting aside long-standing practices in areas ranging from conflict-of-interest rules to the treatment of the White House press corps.14 On the international front, Trump entered office announcing a determination to withdraw from key American commitments in multilateral agreements from NAFTA to the Paris Climate Agreement, proposed to slash funding to the State Department and other domestic agencies with foreign policy or foreign aid responsibilities, called into question the country's commitment to NATO, and evinced a pronounced hostility to the United Nations.15 Trump has also expressed disdain for projects of nation building and promised to cut support for American foreign policy programs designed to advance democracy abroad.16 While Trump's intemperate behavior is clearly unusual, his boastful unilateralism is not. The post-Cold War period, from the Clinton administration through the Obama administration, has more often been characterized by departures from the rule-based order of twentieth-century international institutions than support for them.1 In this sense, events of the last year reflect an accumulating momentum decades in the making rather than the eccentricities of an accidental president. A slow trickle of defections from earlier multilateral commitments by the United States has gathered into a tidal shift, reducing the coherence and stability of liberal constitutional design as a default internationally and transnationally. Thus, to understand the continuities between Trump and earlier administrations requires an appreciation for the complex role liberal constitutionalism and American exceptionalism have played in both creating and undermining an inter- national social contract premised on US hegemony. Over the following pages, we lay out this argument in greater detail, emphasizing how as the domestic creedal commitment tying constitutionalism back to America's founding narrative came under pressure domestically in the post-Cold War era, its imperial correlates-capitalist democratization and a rule- based international ordering principle-began to lose support. We view this as an explanation for the decline in the spread of liberal constitutionalism that is consistent with and indeed underlies other hypotheses in the literature, but one that remains underappreciated. We begin with an analysis of the commitment to con- stitutionalism at the heart of the American century and its rela- tionship to racial and economic policies pursued by American elites. We then trace how the international dimensions of the constitutional project receded with the end of the Cold War by tracking key changes to strategies of democracy promotion and multilateral governance under the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies. Understanding the diffusion of constitutionalism and rule-based international governance as a means of projecting American power transnationally (as a domestic prescription) and globally (as an ordering principle) exposes the degree to which empire and constitutionalism have been deeply imbricated. By extension, we contend that the decline in constitutionalism represents a crisis in the articulation of American global power in the post-Cold War era in which international order has been reframed around a Global War on Terror.", "", ""], "id": "96dae7bc8d28c116eea805a640f73479455d9e71ee7d4febe48858acaaf2d633", "highlighted_text": "the unraveling of the international order put in place under leadership in the postwar period has been more than a quarter century the United States served as a global hegemon whose legitimacy depended on legality that would command consensual participation that still preserved asymmetric benefits for its author. the defining feature of power was liberal constitutionalism America's departures from its own values were not defections at all.

This has implications for promoting democracy as a means to fight terrorism in the long run and compliments the work of Abrahms (2007) and Piazza (2007).", "Democratic states cannot avoid exploitation by rebel groups because of inherent freedoms and liberties existing in democracies.

Depending on where and when it was detonated, the blast, fire, initial radiation, and long-term radioactive fallout from such a bomb could leave the heart of a major city a smoldering radioactive ruin, killing tens or hundreds of thousands of people and wounding hundreds of thousands more. Vast areas would have to be evacuated and might be uninhabitable for years. Economic, political, and social aftershocks would ripple throughout the world. A single terrorist nuclear bomb would change history. The country attacked\u2014and the world\u2014would never be the same. The idea of terrorists accomplishing such a thing is, unfortunately, not out of the question; it is far easier to make a crude, unsafe, unreliable nuclear explosive that might fit in the back of a truck than it is to make a safe, reliable weapon of known yield that can be delivered by missile or combat aircraft. Numerous government studies have concluded that it is plausible that a sophisticated terrorist group could make a crude bomb if they got the needed nuclear material. And in the last quarter century, there have been some 20 seizures of stolen, weapons-usable nuclear material, and at least two terrorist groups have made significant efforts to acquire nuclear bombs. Terrorist use of an actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability event\u2014but the immensity of the consequences means that even a small chance is enough to justify an intensive effort to reduce the risk. Fortunately, since the early 1990s, countries around the world have significantly reduced the danger\u2014but it remains very real, and there is more to do to ensure this nightmare never becomes reality. Brighter than a thousand suns. Imagine a crude terrorist nuclear bomb\u2014containing a chunk of highly enriched uranium just under the size of a regulation bowling ball, or a much smaller chunk of plutonium\u2014suddenly detonating inside a delivery van parked in the heart of a major city. Such a terrorist bomb would release as much as 10 kilotons of explosive energy, or the equivalent of 10,000 tons of conventional explosives, a volume of explosives large enough to fill all the cars of a mile-long train. In a millionth of a second, all of that energy would be released inside that small ball of nuclear material, creating temperatures and pressures as high as those at the center of the sun. That furious energy would explode outward, releasing its energy in three main ways: a powerful blast wave; intense heat; and deadly radiation. The ball would expand almost instantly into a fireball the width of four football fields, incinerating essentially everything and everyone within. The heated fireball would rise, sucking in air from below and expanding above, creating the mushroom cloud that has become the symbol of the terror of the nuclear age. The ionized plasma in the fireball would create a localized electromagnetic pulse more powerful than lightning, shorting out communications and electronics nearby\u2014though most would be destroyed by the bomb\u2019s other effects in any case. (Estimates of heat, blast, and radiation effects in this article are drawn primarily from Alex Wellerstein\u2019s \u201cNukemap,\u201d which itself comes from declassified US government data, such as the 660-page government textbook The Effects of Nuclear Weapons.) At the instant of its detonation, the bomb would also release an intense burst of gamma and neutron radiation which would be lethal for nearly everyone directly exposed within about two-thirds of a mile from the center of the blast. (Those who happened to be shielded by being inside, or having buildings between them and the bomb, would be partly protected\u2014in some cases, reducing their doses by ten times or more.) The nuclear flash from the heat of the fireball would radiate in both visible light and the infrared; it would be \u201cbrighter than a thousand suns,\u201d in the words of the title of a book describing the development of nuclear weapons\u2014adapting a phrase from the Hindu epic the Bhagavad-Gita. Anyone who looked directly at the blast would be blinded. The heat from the fireball would ignite fires and horribly burn everyone exposed outside at distances of nearly a mile away. (In the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, visitors gaze in horror at the bones of a human hand embedded in glass melted by the bomb.) No one has burned a city on that scale in the decades since World War II, so it is difficult to predict the full extent of the fire damage that would occur from the explosion of a nuclear bomb in one of today\u2019s cities. Modern glass, steel, and concrete buildings would presumably be less flammable than the wood-and-rice-paper housing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki in the 1940s\u2014but many questions remain, including exactly how thousands of broken gas lines might contribute to fire damage (as they did in Dresden during World War II). On 9/11, the buildings of the World Trade Center proved to be much more vulnerable to fire damage than had been expected. Ultimately, even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb would carry the possibility that the countless fires touched off by the explosion would coalesce into a devastating firestorm, as occurred at Hiroshima. In a firestorm, the rising column of hot air from the massive fire sucks in the air from all around, creating hurricane-force winds; everything flammable and everything alive within the firestorm would be consumed. The fires and the dust from the blast would make it extremely difficult for either rescuers or survivors to see. The explosion would create a powerful blast wave rushing out in every direction. For more than a quarter-mile all around the blast, the pulse of pressure would be over 20 pounds per square inch above atmospheric pressure (known as \u201coverpressure\u201d), destroying or severely damaging even sturdy buildings. The combination of blast, heat, and radiation would kill virtually everyone in this zone. The blast would be accompanied by winds of many hundreds of miles per hour. The damage from the explosion would extend far beyond this inner zone of almost total death. Out to more than half a mile, the blast would be strong enough to collapse most residential buildings and create a serious danger that office buildings would topple over, killing those inside and those in the path of the rubble. (On the other hand, the office towers of a modern city would tend to block the blast wave in some areas, providing partial protection from the blast, as well as from the heat and radiation.) In that zone, almost anything made of wood would be destroyed: Roofs would cave in, windows would shatter, gas lines would rupture. Telephone poles, street lamps, and utility lines would be severely damaged. Many roads would be blocked by mountains of wreckage. In this zone, many people would be killed or injured in building collapses, or trapped under the rubble; many more would be burned, blinded, or injured by flying debris. In many cases, their charred skin would become ragged and fall off in sheets. The effects of the detonation would act in deadly synergy. The smashed materials of buildings broken by the blast would be far easier for the fires to ignite than intact structures. The effects of radiation would make it far more difficult for burned and injured people to recover. The combination of burns, radiation, and physical injuries would cause far more death and suffering than any one of them would alone. The silent killer. The bomb\u2019s immediate effects would be followed by a slow, lingering killer: radioactive fallout. A bomb detonated at ground level would dig a huge crater, hurling tons of earth and debris thousands of feet into the sky. Sucked into the rising fireball, these particles would mix with the radioactive remainders of the bomb, and over the next few hours or days, the debris would rain down for miles downwind. Depending on weather and wind patterns, the fallout could actually be deadlier and make a far larger area unusable than the blast itself. Acute radiation sickness from the initial radiation pulse and the fallout would likely affect tens of thousands of people. Depending on the dose, they might suffer from vomiting, watery diarrhea, fever, sores, loss of hair, and bone marrow depletion. Some would survive; some would die within days; some would take months to die. Cancer rates among the survivors would rise. Women would be more vulnerable than men\u2014children and infants especially so. Much of the radiation from a nuclear blast is short-lived; radiation levels even a few days after the blast would be far below those in the first hours. For those not killed or terribly wounded by the initial explosion, the best advice would be to take shelter in a basement for at least several days. But many would be too terrified to stay. Thousands of panic-stricken people might receive deadly doses of radiation as they fled from their homes. Some of the radiation will be longer-lived; areas most severely affected would have to be abandoned for many years after the attack. The combination of radioactive fallout and the devastation of nearly all life-sustaining infrastructure over a vast area would mean that hundreds of thousands of people would have to evacuate. Ambulances to nowhere. The explosion would also destroy much of the city\u2019s ability to respond. Hospitals would be leveled, doctors and nurses killed and wounded, ambulances destroyed. (In Hiroshima, 42 of 45 hospitals were destroyed or severely damaged, and 270 of 300 doctors were killed.) Resources that survived outside the zone of destruction would be utterly overwhelmed. Hospitals have no ability to cope with tens or hundreds of thousands of terribly burned and injured people all at once; the United States, for example, has 1,760 burn beds in hospitals nationwide, of which a third are available on any given day. And the problem would not be limited to hospitals; firefighters, for example, would have little ability to cope with thousands of fires raging out of control at once. Fire stations and equipment would be destroyed in the affected area, and firemen killed, along with police and other emergency responders. Some of the first responders may become casualties themselves, from radioactive fallout, fire, and collapsing buildings. Over much of the affected area, communications would be destroyed, by both the physical effects and the electromagnetic pulse from the explosion. Better preparation for such a disaster could save thousands of lives\u2014but ultimately, there is no way any city can genuinely be prepared for a catastrophe on such a historic scale, occurring in a flash, with zero warning. Rescue and recovery attempts would be impeded by the destruction of most of the needed personnel and equipment, and by fire, debris, radiation, fear, lack of communications, and the immense scale of the disaster. The US military and the national guard could provide critically important capabilities\u2014but federal plans assume that \u201cno significant federal response\u201d would be available for 24-to-72 hours. Many of those burned and injured would wait in vain for help, food, or water, perhaps for days. The scale of death and suffering. How many would die in such an event, and how many would be terribly wounded, would depend on where and when the bomb was detonated, what the weather conditions were at the time, how successful the response was in helping the wounded survivors, and more. Many estimates of casualties are based on census data, which reflect where people sleep at night; if the attack occurred in the middle of a workday, the numbers of people crowded into the office towers at the heart of many modern cities would be far higher. The daytime population of Manhattan, for example, is roughly twice its nighttime population; in Midtown on a typical workday, there are an estimated 980,000 people per square mile. A 10-kiloton weapon detonated there might well kill half a million people\u2014not counting those who might die of radiation sickness from the fallout. (These effects were analyzed in great detail in the Rand Corporation\u2019s Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack and the British Medical Journal\u2019s \u201cNuclear terrorism.\u201d) On a typical day, the wind would blow the fallout north, seriously contaminating virtually all of Manhattan above Gramercy Park; people living as far away as Stamford, Connecticut would likely have to evacuate. Seriously injured survivors would greatly outnumber the dead, their suffering magnified by the complete inadequacy of available help. The psychological and social effects\u2014overwhelming sadness, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, myriad forms of anxiety\u2014would be profound and long-lasting. The scenario we have been describing is a groundburst. An airburst\u2014such as might occur, for example, if terrorists put their bomb in a small aircraft they had purchased or rented\u2014would extend the blast and fire effects over a wider area, killing and injuring even larger numbers of people immediately. But an airburst would not have the same lingering effects from fallout as a groundburst, because the rock and dirt would not be sucked up into the fireball and contaminated. The 10-kiloton blast we have been discussing is likely toward the high end of what terrorists could plausibly achieve with a crude, improvised bomb, but even a 1-kiloton blast would be a catastrophic event, having a deadly radius between one-third and one-half that of a 10-kiloton blast. These hundreds of thousands of people would not be mere statistics, but countless individual stories of loss\u2014parents, children, entire families; all religions; rich and poor alike\u2014killed or horribly mutilated. Human suffering and tragedy on this scale does not have to be imagined; it can be remembered through the stories of the survivors of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only times in history when nuclear weapons have been used intentionally against human beings. The pain and suffering caused by those bombings are almost beyond human comprehension; the eloquent testimony of the Hibakusha\u2014the survivors who passed through the atomic fire\u2014should stand as an eternal reminder of the need to prevent nuclear weapons from ever being used in anger again. Global economic disaster. The economic impact of such an attack would be enormous. The effects would reverberate for so far and so long that they are difficult to estimate in all their complexity. Hundreds of thousands of people would be too injured or sick to work for weeks or months. Hundreds of thousands more would evacuate to locations far from their jobs. Many places of employment would have to be abandoned because of the radioactive fallout. Insurance companies would reel under the losses; but at the same time, many insurance policies exclude the effects of nuclear attacks\u2014an item insurers considered beyond their ability to cover\u2014so the owners of thousands of buildings would not have the insurance payments needed to cover the cost of fixing them, thousands of companies would go bankrupt, and banks would be left holding an immense number of mortgages that would never be repaid. Consumer and investor confidence would likely be dramatically affected, as worried people slowed their spending. Enormous new homeland security and military investments would be very likely. If the bomb had come in a shipping container, the targeted country\u2014and possibly others\u2014might stop all containers from entering until it could devise a system for ensuring they could never again be used for such a purpose, throwing a wrench into the gears of global trade for an extended period. (And this might well occur even if a shipping container had not been the means of delivery.) Even the far smaller 9/11 attacks are estimated to have caused economic aftershocks costing almost $1 trillion even excluding the multi-trillion-dollar costs of the wars that ensued. The cost of a terrorist nuclear attack in a major city would likely be many times higher. The most severe effects would be local, but the effects of trade disruptions, reduced economic activity, and more would reverberate around the world. Consequently, while some countries may feel that nuclear terrorism is only a concern for the countries most likely to be targeted\u2014such as the United States\u2014in reality it is a threat to everyone, everywhere. In 2005, then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that these global effects would push \u201ctens of millions of people into dire poverty,\u201d creating \u201ca second death toll throughout the developing world.\u201d One recent estimate suggested that a nuclear attack in an urban area would cause a global recession, cutting global Gross Domestic Product by some two percent, and pushing an additional 30 million people in the developing world into extreme poverty. Desperate dilemmas. In short, an act of nuclear terrorism could rip the heart out of a major city, and cause ripple effects throughout the world. The government of the country attacked would face desperate decisions: How to help the city attacked? How to prevent further attacks? How to respond or retaliate? Terrorists\u2014either those who committed the attack or others\u2014would probably claim they had more bombs already hidden in other cities (whether they did or not), and threaten to detonate them unless their demands were met. The fear that this might be true could lead people to flee major cities in a large-scale, uncontrolled evacuation. There is very little ability to support the population of major cities in the surrounding countryside. The potential for widespread havoc and economic chaos is very real. If the detonation took place in the capital of the nation attacked, much of the government might be destroyed. A bomb in Washington, D.C., for example, might kill the President, the Vice President, and many of the members of Congress and the Supreme Court. (Having some plausible national leader survive is a key reason why one cabinet member is always elsewhere on the night of the State of the Union address.) Elaborate, classified plans for \u201ccontinuity of government\u201d have already been drawn up in a number of countries, but the potential for chaos and confusion\u2014if almost all of a country\u2019s top leaders were killed\u2014would still be enormous. Who, for example, could address the public on what the government would do, and what the public should do, to respond? Could anyone honestly assure the public there would be no further attacks? If they did, who would believe them? In the United States, given the practical impossibility of passing major legislation with Congress in ruins and most of its members dead or seriously injured, some have argued for passing legislation in advance giving the government emergency powers to act\u2014and creating procedures, for example, for legitimately replacing most of the House of Representatives. But to date, no such legislative preparations have been made. In what would inevitably be a desperate effort to prevent further attacks, traditional standards of civil liberties might be jettisoned, at least for a time\u2014particularly when people realized that the fuel for the bomb that had done such damage would easily have fit in a suitcase. Old rules limiting search and surveillance could be among the first to go. The government might well impose martial law as it sought to control the situation, hunt for the perpetrators, and find any additional weapons or nuclear materials they might have. Even the far smaller attacks of 9/11 saw the US government authorizing torture of prisoners and mass electronic surveillance. And what standards of international order and law would still hold sway? The country attacked might well lash out militarily at whatever countries it thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in Brian Jenkins\u2019 book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) With the nuclear threshold already crossed in this scenario\u2014at least by terrorists\u2014it is conceivable that some of the resulting conflicts might escalate to nuclear use. International politics could become more brutish and violent, with powerful states taking unilateral action, by force if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security. After 9/11, the United States led the invasions of two sovereign nations, in wars that have since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging a region into chaos. Would the reaction after a far more devastating nuclear attack be any less?"], "id": "8a26ab9809910e350eed647d9281c50dbaf5836e8e5d1d9fdfaea82c82d7ba5e", "highlighted_text": "a single terrorist nuclear

The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania have led to a dramatic re-orientation of United States foreign policy toward the Middle East. Predicated on the hypothesis\u2014now the dominant foreign policy paradigm within the Bush administration\u2014that terrorism is a product of nondemocratic governance, a new idealistic interventionism has replaced the legacy of Cold War realism, culminating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq for the purposes of \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d; that is to say removing the conditions that foster terrorism, namely dictatorship. How might promotion of democracy and civil freedoms in the Middle East reduce terrorism? Proponents of democracy promotion view the climate of \u201cunfreedom\u201d that pervades most Middle-Eastern countries as a dangerous precipitant to extremist thought and behavior that results in terrorist activity.1 The repression, violence, and systematic humiliation used by Middle Eastern regimes like Iraq or Syria as tools of popular control foster public rage and increase the appeal of fanaticism. In the absence of a free press or freedom of public expression, proponents of democracy promotion argued, an \u201cepistemological retardation\u201d pervades political discourse fostering a mood of paranoia and giving credence to conspiracy stories in which the United States and its allies, namely Israel, are perpetual villains. Also, in these nondemocracies, public grievances are not addressed and are allowed to fester, providing extremist groups with material for propaganda, facilitating their recruiting efforts and legitimizing their acts of political violence. Finally, the nature of nondemocratic regimes retards the public virtues of political moderation and compromise, which are necessary ingredients of nonviolent political expression (Muravchik 2001). Jennifer L. Windsor, executive director of the Washington, D.C.\u2013based nonprofit Freedom House, articulates a similar vision of the relationship between democratic governance and the reduction of terrorism in the Middle East: The underlying logic is that democratic institutions and procedures, by enabling the peaceful reconciliation of grievances and providing channels of participation in policymaking, can help to address those underlying conditions that have fueled the rise of Islamist Extremism. ... More specifically, promoting democratization in the closed societies of the Middle East can provide a set of values and ideas that offer a powerful alternative to the kind of extremism that today has found expression in terrorist activity, often against U.S. interests. (Windsor 2003, 43) Democracy, Civil Liberties, and Terrorism: Political Access versus Strategic Targeting By and large, scholarly research on the relationship between terrorism, dictatorship, and democracy does not lend empirical support to the argument that there is a linear relationship between democratic governance or protection of civil liberties and the incidence of terrorism. Traditionally, scholars have proposed the opposite: that democracies are more conducive to terrorist activity than are dictatorships (Schmid 1992; Charters 1994; Eubank and Weinerg 1994, 1998 and 2001). Other research indicates that the relationship between democracy and terrorism is either mixed and qualified (Li 2005) or nonlinear (Eyerman 1998). Recent research by Li (2005) finds that although \u201cdemocratic participation\u201d is a negative predictor of the incidence of international terrorism within a country, \u201cgovernment constraints\u201d in the form of institutional limitations to executive power found in most democracies increases terrorism in countries. Li further illustrates that various electoral institutions within democracies\u2014for example, proportional verses \u201cfirst-past-the-post\u201d systems\u2014are also positive and negative predictors of the incidence of terrorism. In his seminal study Eyerman (1998), using the assumption that terrorist groups, like all political groups, seek to maximize their rational utility and weigh the costs against the benefits associated with each terrorist act, observes that there are two theoretical schools of thought regarding the relationship between democracy and terrorism. The first, termed the \u201cpolitical access\u201d school, holds that by providing multiple avenues by which actors can advance their political agendas, democracies increase the utility of legal political activity for all political actors, including terrorists. Within democracies there is more political space available than in dictatorships, so there is room \u201cwithin the system\u201d for actors who subscribe to anti-status quo or non-mainstream opinions. It is important to note that the access school is a \u201cpolitical actor-focused\u201d conceptual framework, meaning that it argues that democracy provides greater opportunities for terrorists to join mainstream politics. This is in contrast to \u201cconsumer-focused\u201d conceptions that argue that democracy makes extremists who may engage in terrorism less appealing to the public. One would therefore expect democracies to have fewer terrorist attacks, as would-be terrorists merely pursue legitimate political activities to achieve their goals (Crenshaw 1990; Denardo 1985). The second, termed the \u201cstrategic school,\u201d maintains that democracies are more tempting targets for terrorism than are dictatorships because their respect for civil liberties constrain them from more effective antiterrorism efforts such as surveillance, control over movement and personal ownership of weapons, associational life, and media. These same restrictions of executive and police power that are features of democracy also make democratic countries good hosts for terrorist groups. Moreover, the legitimacy of democratic government rests ultimately on the public\u2019s perception of how well it can protect it citizens, and in a democracy citizens can punish elected officials at the ballot box for failure to protect the public. This quality of public responsiveness makes democracies more willing to negotiate with terrorists, thus increasing the potential benefits reaped for extremist groups by terrorist action (Charters 1994; Schmid 1993; Eubank and Weinberg 1992). Eyerman (1998) and a new generation of scholars find empirical support for both the access and strategic schools. In his own study, Eyerman found that although democracies overall did exhibit fewer terrorist acts, \u201cnew\u201d democracies were more prone to terrorism. New democracies possess all of the liabilities inherent in democracies in general, making them tempting targets for terrorists as expected by the strategic school, but they are not as able as established democracies to provide to terrorists benefits that consistently outweigh the costs of engaging in political violence as opposed to legal political action because they lack strong and durable political institutions. Similar results are found by Abadie (2004) and Iqbal and Zorn (2003), that nonconsolidated democracies are more likely to exhibit terrorism and political violence, and are consistent with earlier empirical work by Gurr (2000, 1993), which finds that democratization itself can promote political violence because powerful actors may seek to preserve their authority in the midst of uncertainty fostered by the democratic process. The findings produced in these studies linking new democracies to terrorism, however, are limited by several design and theoretical qualities. First, with the exception of Li (2005), they employ rather limited time-frames\u2014most are confined to one or two decades of events or less\u2014and therefore might be distorted by medium-term episodic rises or falls in general levels of political violence. This is a limitation given that some scholarship has indicated terrorism occurs in waves that coincide with longer-term changes in global political and economic trends (Bergensen and Lizardo 2004). The exception is Iqbal and Zorn (2003), but their study is limited only to examination of predictors of assassinations of heads of state from 1946 to 2000 rather than general incidents of terrorism. Second, all but one of the studies (Abadie 2004) considers only international terrorist acts, where the perpetrators and the victims or targets are of different nationalities, rather than both domestic and international incidents, and all of the studies code their dependent variable (terrorism) based on the country where the incident took place. These design features not only eliminate a rather large number of events from the studies, but also severely impair any examination of both the access school and the neoconservative hypothesis on the causes of terrorism. In the post-911 context, in which policymakers speculate that political conditions, namely the lack of democracy, in the \u201chome\u201d countries of the terrorist perpetrators themselves (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates) are important causes for attacks, it seems particularly important to be able to consider the regime typology of the country from which the perpetrators are based and to consider all manifestations of terrorism, including the most common manifestation: domestic terrorism. Finally, with the exception of Iqbal and Zorn (2003) who include a variable for civil wars, none of the studies control for domestic political instability. The shift in Washington toward democratic state-building as a means to reduce terrorism has been accompanied by a much less pronounced discussion among foreign policymakers about the appropriate timeframe for the withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq. Within this discussion lies the question of whether or not Iraq is becoming a \u201cfailed state:\u201d a society experiencing severe political instability in which the state is unable to provide basic \u201cpolitical goods\u201d to its citizens such as personal security. This raises a second foreign policy conventional wisdom, though one that is much less vociferously articulated by the Bush administration, that failed states like Colombia, Somalia, or Indonesia (or potentially Iraq) are incubators for terrorist groups and terrorist activity (Campbell and Flourney 2001). U.S. Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel explains that these types of states pose the most severe threat to U.S. security at home and abroad because, \u201cTerrorism finds sanctuary in failed or failing states...\u201d (Hagel 2004, 65), Terrorism and State Failure There is a small body of literature on the relationship between failed states and terrorism, but it is theoretical or qualitative case study\u2013oriented rather than empirical (Rotberg 2002, 2003; Kahler 2002; Takeyh and Gvosdev 2002). The relationship has two mutually reinforcing features: (1) state failure helps to create the conditions that create terrorists and (2) failed states provide crucial opportunities for already existing terrorist groups. First, by failing to provide for basic human needs and lacking functioning governing institutions, failed states cannot adequately manage conflicts in society or provide citizens with essential public goods such as security, education, or economic opportunity. This damages the legitimacy of the state and of mainstream, legal political behavior, thus propelling individuals into extralegal action such as terrorism. Failed states are also characterized by predatory political elites that prey on citizens and damage the government\u2019s ability to manage social strife. The result is that significant proportions of the population reject the authority of the central government, providing a wider recruiting pool for terrorist groups and a citizenry that will tolerate, if not aid, them. Second, state failure erodes the ability of national governments to project power internally, creating a political space for non-state actors like terrorist groups, and creates the conditions under which state agents may provide organizational and financial assets to terrorists. Terrorists can rely on large amounts of territory to base operations such as training, communications, arms storage, and revenue generating activities that go beyond the much more limited network of safe houses they are limited to constructing in countries with stronger states. Frequently, political elites within failed states are willing to tolerate the presence of large-scale terrorist operations within national borders in exchange for material compensation, political support or terrorist services during times of political turmoil. Failed states lack adequate or consistent law-enforcement capabilities, thus permitting terrorist organizations to develop extra-legal fundraising activities such as smuggling or drug trafficking. However, failed states are recognized nation-states within the world community and therefore retain \u201cthe outward signs of sovereignty\u201d (Tadekh and Gvosdev 2002, 100), thus providing terrorist groups with the necessary legal documentation, such as passports or end user certificates for arms acquisition, and protection from external policing efforts. The Middle East Although the Middle East is the primary laboratory for testing the utility of democracy promotion as anti-terrorism policy\u2014exemplified by the 2003 war and occupation in Iraq and ruminations of the use of military force against Syria and Iran\u2014the states of the Middle East provide a useful universe to empirically test the relationship between (lack of) democracy, civil liberties, state failure, and terrorism. Table 1 illustrates that the states of the Middle East afford researchers with a large number of illiberal political regimes as well as significant numbers of states that have experienced state failures, making the region central to the discussion of regime type and political stability as determinants of terrorism. The Middle East is arguably the least democratic region of the world. Freedom House notes that in 2003, only 5.6 percent of Middle Eastern and North African states could be considered \u201cfree\u201d in terms of political rights or civil liberties, placing it behind every other developing world area including Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the Middle East is \u201cbucking the trend\u201d of democratization in the world. The \u201cFreedom in the World 2004\u201d report issued by Freedom House notes that while every other region has increased the number of states considered to be free\u2014the so-called Third Wave of democratization\u2014the Middle East has actually seen a reduction in the number of free states since the mid-1990s. Only two democracies exist in the Middle East: Israel and Turkey. While the former, Israel, guarantees democratic freedoms only for Israeli citizens, who are roughly 65 percent of the population of the total territory Israel administers, the latter, Turkey, is an incomplete and unconsolidated democracy where elected civilian government is regularly punctuated by military rule. A second strata of states\u2014Algeria, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait\u2014are all nondemocracies, but have at times experimented with limited political and civil liberalization. The remaining states are solid dictatorships, one group of which\u2014Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Tunisia, Syria, and Yemen\u2014are bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes characterized by one-party rule and personalistic dictators and another group\u2014Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are autocratic monarchies. Next to Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East is the region exhibiting the largest percentage of states that suffer from state failures from 1998 to 2003, although all of the regions of the world dominated by developing or transitional states besides Latin America have relatively high levels of state failure. What makes the Middle East unique, and what is not captured by the figures in Table 1, is the intense and chronic nature of state failure exhibited in some states in the region. Several states\u2014Lebanon from 1975 to 1991; Israel from 1987 to 2004; Iraq from 1980 to 1998; and Turkey from 1984 to 2000\u2014have experienced prolonged periods of armed ethnic conflict, civil war, and widespread political insurgency. Others suffer from prolonged but low-grade insurgencies such as the Saharawi insurrection in Morocco 1975 to 1989 or the Dhofar tribal insurgency in Oman from 1970 to 1976, or from short but intense bouts of large-scale conflict such as the Syrian confrontation with Islamist guerrillas in 1982 or the suppression of a separatist insurgency by Yemen in 1993. Like many African states, Middle Eastern states suffer from what Kahler (2002) refers to as \u201cstateless areas,\u201d a condition linked to the incubation of terrorism where the central government is unable to project its power in substantial regions of the country controlled by insurgents or regional actors. A report on terrorism in Yemen by the International Crisis Group faults the weakness of Yemeni political institutions, poverty and the inability of the state to extend its authority to more remote tribal regions as precipitants of domestic terrorism (International Crisis Group 2003). Kahler does allow for a non-spatial variant of the stateless area condition in the case of Saudi Arabia, arguing that the Saudi government was not able to penetrate powerful civil society and parastatal institutions, namely Muslim charities, that provide material sustenance to groups like Al Qaeda. Lebanon from 1975 to 1982 (and possibly later) also fits the bill as failed state suffering from stateless areas, which permitted the Palestine Liberation Organization to base its operations in Beirut and Southern Lebanon. Analysis This study seeks to add to the discussion of dictatorship and state failures as root causes of terrorism by conducting a cross-national, pooled, time-series statistical regression analysis on the incidence of terrorism in 19 Middle Eastern states from 1972 to 2003. The analysis is limited to the Middle East, specifically the cases of Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel\u2013Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, in order test the contention that democracy is a panacea for terrorism in the region of the world that U.S. foreign policymakers have chosen as their laboratory for their counterterrorism policy model and to also provide an empirical base to the largely descriptive and theoretical body of scholarship on terrorism produced by Middle Easternists2 (see, for example, Zunes 2003; Khashan 1997; Lewis 1987; Martin 1987; Amos 1985). There are three hypotheses tested in the analysis, using 16 negative binomial regression models on a total of 493 observations: Hypothesis 1: Democratic governance and state protection of civil liberties in the Middle East are negatively related to the incidence of terrorism. Hypothesis 2: Democratic governance and state protection of civil liberties in the Middle East are positively related to the incidence of terrorism. Hypothesis 1 captures the expectations of the political access school of thought regarding terrorism where one would expect more politically liberal states to be equipped to integrate the political expectations of would-be terrorists into a legal rather than extra-legal framework. The result would be fewer terrorist attacks both at home and abroad. Hypothesis 2 captures the expectations of the strategic school of thought, which argues that democracies are both particularly vulnerable to attack from domestic and or international terrorists and may find themselves hosts to terrorist groups because their antiterrorism policies are constricted by the rights protections inherent in all democratic societies. The states of the Middle East also provide a wide range of state failures to examine as predictors of terrorist activity. Controlling for democratic governance and other socioeconomic variables, a third hypothesis is also studied: Hypothesis 3: State failures, measured in the aggregate, are positively related to the incidence of domestic and international terrorism in the cases examined. Because of the nature of the dependent variable in the study, a Poisson distribution is more appropriate that an ordinary least squares (OLS) statistical regression model to analyze the data. The study seeks to explain change or variation in the incidence (frequency) of terrorist incidents, sorted by country targeted by the attacks and the country that is the \u201chost\u201d of the group launching the attacks. Terrorist attacks are sporadic and concentrated in certain countries or at certain time periods, and therefore from a quantitative perspective cannot be expected to be conform to a normal distribution. Also, an event count of terrorist incidents cannot produce negative count data for any given observation; the lowest value of any observation is a zero, indicating that no terrorist attacks have occurred in that country in that year. Both of these qualities violate basic assumptions of OLS regression analysis and recommend a Poisson distribution instead. Furthermore, given that the individual event counts used in the study are not theoretically independent of each other\u2014a country may very well experience a rash of attacks spread out across multiple years by the same terrorist group\u2014a negative binomial Poisson distribution is most appropriate. It produces the same mean as a basic Poisson distribution, but is better suited to data exhibiting a wider variance, thus reducing standard errors and netting less biased estimators (Brandt et al. 2000; Cameron and Trivedi 1998; King 1989). In the study the state of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories are operationalized as one aggregated case, though this may be a controversial methodological decision. There are two justifications for aggregating these two entities into one case: First and foremost, the two entities are highly interconnected in terms of political, economic, and social life. The political conflict that produces terrorism within both of the entities was produced by the political conflict originating in the 1967 occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem by Israeli forces that continues to this day. Moreover, nationals of both political entities reside throughout Israel proper and the occupied territories, and until recently, Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank regularly commuted into Israel for employment. Second, the state of Israel has effectively controlled public policy within the occupied territories since 1967, and this has meant that the Israeli government has helped to determine the shape of political and economic development both for Jewish residents of Israeli proper and Palestinians living in the territories. This poses a simple methodological problem: there is no independent government, or economy, on which to base measurements of variables for the Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank. Although a semi-independent Palestinian National Authority was created in 1994, it still lacks sovereignty, the quintessential quality of all nation-states. To remedy this, all variables for the case Israel\u2013Palestine are operationalized as indexes of population-weighted averages that include the State of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, producing aggregate measures of the regime type, economy, and demographic structure of the populations of both entities. However, this methodological decision could potentially bias the study and is vulnerable to charges of subjectivity on the part of the researcher. Therefore, a separate set of statistical models are run that exclude Israel\u2013Palestine as a case to determine the dependence of models on the total 19 cases on inclusion of Israel\u2013Palestine. The source for yearly terrorist incidents by case\u2014the unit of analysis for the study\u2014is the data collected by the Rand Corporation and collated by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, which operationally defines terrorism as: ...violence, or the threat of violence, calculated to create an atmosphere of fear and alarm. These acts are designed to coerce others into actions they would not otherwise undertake, or refrain from actions they desired to take. All terrorist acts are crimes. Many would also be violation of the rules of war if a state of war existed. This violence or threat of violence is generally directed against civilian targets. The motives of all terrorists are political, and terrorist actions are generally carried out in a way that will achieve maximum publicity. Unlike other criminal acts, terrorists often claim credit for their acts. Finally, terrorist acts are intended to produce effects beyond the immediate physical damage of the cause, having long-term psychological repercussions on a particular target audience. The fear created by terrorists may be intended to cause people to exaggerate the strengths of the terrorist and the importance of the cause, to provoke governmental overreaction, to discourage dissent, or simply to intimidate and thereby enforce compliance with their demands.3 To fully test the two hypotheses, especially in order to examine both the access and strategic schools, and to make appropriate use of the MIPT data, terrorism is operationalized as four dependent variables which are run in separate models: (1) international terrorist incidents sorted by the country targeted from 1972 to 1997; (2) international and domestic terrorist incidents sorted by the country targeted from 1998 to 2003; (3) terrorist incidents sorted by country or countries that serve as the base for terrorist attacks abroad from 1972 to 1997; (4) terrorist incidents sorted by country or countries that serve as the base for terrorist attacks both domestically and abroad from 1998 to 2003. The first distinction, between international and international and domestic incidents, is one driven by the data available from MIPT. Although it is methodological desirable to consider both domestic and international attacks combined\u2014incidents committed where the perpetrator and the target or victim may or may not be nationals of the same country\u2014for the entire time-series, aggregation of incidents in this way is only available post 1998.4 Prior to 1998, data is only available for international incidents. Terrorists incidents are also sorted both by \u201ctarget,\u201d the country and year within the time-series in which the terrorist act occurred, and by \u201csource,\u201d the country or countries per year that serve as bases of operation for terrorist groups that engage in operations, as defined by the MIPT database of terrorist organizations. Targeted countries and source countries are analyzed in separate dependent variables. Examining both states targeted by terrorism and states that are sources for terrorist groups facilitates a more confident evaluation of both the access and strategic schools as well as the role played by state failures because it paints a complete picture of the domestic vulnerability of the state to terrorist attacks and the domestic political conditions that may breed terrorists. The analysis contains no incidents that occurred across two different countries, thereby yielding two target countries. However, as is often the case, terrorist groups base their operations in more than one state. For the analysis, each state that is the host of the terrorist group perpetrating the act in question is allocated an equal count of the event. As an example, because the Black September Organization, a Palestinian militant group active in the 1970s and 1980s, is listed by MIPT as having bases of operation in Jordan, Lebanon, and in the Palestinian Occupied Territories during its active period, a terrorist act committed by Black September in a given year will be recorded as one incident for Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel\u2013Palestine. This is an imperfect methodology because it equally weights three states as sources for terrorism though in reality the \u201cstateless area\u201d afforded Black September by civil-war wracked Lebanon in the 1980s or the lack of political freedom that plagues Palestinians living in Jordan or the limitations to counterterrorism efforts placed on the Israeli state by its democratic process and legal institutions might play a disproportionate role in fueling terrorist incidents. However, data do not permit fine-tuning of this nature and this is the least-subjective method of distribution of acts by source country. Table 2 lists all variables used in the models as well as their operationalization. To test the hypotheses, three independent variables are used: one that measures the degree of democratic governance in each case per year, \u201cDemocracy (Polity IV)\u201d; another that measures the degree of civil liberties protections in each case per year, \u201cFH Civil Liberties\u201d; and the other measures the presence and intensity of state failures in each case per year, \u201cState Failures.\u201d The first independent variable is operationalized as the yearly \u201cPOLITY\u201d measurement from the Polity IV database. This measurement is an index ranging from -10, signifying a complete autocracy, to 10, signifying a complete democracy. The expectation, given the two-tailed nature of the first hypothesis, is that Democracy (Polity IV) will either be a positive or negative predictor of the incidents in terrorism, measured all four ways in the statistical models. The second independent variable is operationalized as annual index of civil liberties protections coded by the independent nongovernmental agency Freedom House in its annual publication \u201cFreedom in the World.\u201d The Freedom House civil liberties index is an ordinal measure between \u201c1,\u201d which would indicate a status of the highest protection of civil liberties such as freedom of speech, conscience or association, and \u201c7,\u201d which would indicate a status of the lowest protection of aforementioned rights. As with Democracy (Polity IV), the expectation given the two-tailed nature of the first hypothesis is that FH Civil Liberties will either be a positive or negative predictor of the incidents in terrorism, measured all four ways in the statistical models. The third independent variable is operationalized as a measure of aggregate state failures suffered by a given case in a given year. All data for state failures is taken from the State Failure Task Force database, collected by researchers associated with the Center for International Development and Conflict Management (CIDCM) at the University of Maryland. The CIDCM State Failure Task Force defines state failures as episodes of extreme political instability that test the ability of the state to preserve order and identifies four major types of state failure: ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, genocides and politicides, and adverse regime changes. The variable \u201cState Failures\u201d in this analysis is an additive index ranging from 0 to 16 of the intensity levels of all four types of state failure, which themselves are coded by the State Failure Task Force as measures of intensity where 0 indicates no state failures and 4 indicates highly intense manifestations of state failures. The expectation is that State Failures will be a positive predictor of the incidence of terrorism across all of the models. The models control for several socioeconomic features. The first is \u201cArea,\u201d or the total surface area contained within the recognized boundaries of each state, and the second is \u201cPopulation,\u201d or the yearly total population count in millions. Eyerman (1998) notes that geographically large countries have higher policing costs and are therefore more susceptible to terrorist attacks. Likewise, populous countries also raise the costs associated with counterterrorism efforts as terrorist groups can more easily obscure their activities and escape detection. Gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), measured yearly in millions of $U.S., is a control used by Abadie (2004) and Eyerman (1998) in their respective studies and measures the total resources available to enhance state policing and or repressive measures. It is something of a conventional wisdom that poverty and poor economic development are root causes of terrorism, although this has not been validated by a slate of recent empirical studies (Piazza 2006; Abadie 2004; Krueger and Maleckova 2003), though Li and Schaub (2004) in their statistical study of 112 countries from 1975 to 1997 did find that a country\u2019s GDP was a negative predictor of terrorism, positioning level of economic development as an interaction variable linking international economic openness to lower levels of terrorism. It is nonetheless considered as a control and is expected to be a negative predictor of terrorism across the models, if significant at all. Finally, a variable measuring the total years that the current political regime has been in place in each observation, labeled \u201cRegime Durability,\u201d is also included in the analysis. Regime Durability is operationalized by inserting the value for \u201cDurable\u201d coded in the Polity IV dataset. It is expected that more durable regimes are less likely to experience terrorism. (Li 2005) Sixteen statistical models are run in all. The nucleus of the analysis is contained in models 1 through 8 to accommodate four dependent variables\u2014the two measures of terrorist incidents, international and international and domestic attacks, each of which is sorted into attacks by target and attacks by source\u2014and to accommodate two independent variables\u2014both Democracy (Polity IV) and FH Civil Liberties\u2014which are run in separate models. Furthermore, models 1 through 8 are run yet again omitting Israel\u2013Palestine as a case as models 9 through 16 to control for the outlier effect that those observations may contain. Finally, two features are added to the models to correct for autocorrelation and multicollinearity errors. A 1-year lagged dependent variable [B1Incidents(t-1)j] is inserted after the intercept, as is appropriate in time-series multiple regression analysis, and a collinearity test is run on all of the independent variables. Results Table 3 presents the results of the first four models, which examine the effects of the independent variables on the incidence of terrorism by target country in the Middle East The results of models 1 through 4 lend partial support to the strategic school, rather than the political access school, as it applies to Middle Eastern states. In Models 1 and 3, which examine international terrorist attacks only, specifically where the perpetrator and the target or victim are of different national origins, Democracy (Polity IV) is a positive predictor of terrorism whereas FH Civil Liberties is a negative predictor. This suggests that terrorism is more likely to occur in Middle-Eastern states that are political democracies and that protect civil liberties. (Note that the operationalization of FH Civil Liberties is inverted\u2014regimes that protect civil liberties are scored low on the scale\u2014so results are interpreted using the opposite sign of results for Democracy [Polity IV]). However, when terrorism is measured as both domestic and international attacks by target, neither Democracy (Polity IV) nor FH Civil Liberties are signfiicant. This is an interesting result because the two measurements of terrorism are logically and quantitatively\u2014there are more total attacks coded per year when using the international and domestic aggregation\u2014different. However, it is also possible that the different results found in models 1 and 3 and models 2 and 4 are due to the very different time-series used: the 26-year series (1972 to 1997) for international only verses the six year series (1998 to 2003) for the international combined with domestic. A more comparable span of data would be desirable, although presently unobtainable. However, across three of the first four models, State Failures is a strong, significant, and positive predictor of terrorism, regardless of how terrorism is measured. This suggests that Middle-Eastern states that suffer from state failures are more likely to both host groups that will commit terrorist acts at home and abroad and are also more likely to be the target of terrorist groups from other states. Moreover, in three of the four models, the coefficient for State Failures is the largest in the model, and the coefficients are significant at the highest (.000) level. Few of the control variables are significant across models 1\u20134, and there are two surprising results. Population is a significant predictor in models 1 and 3, as expected, but GDP is a significant positive predictor of terrorism in models 2 and 4 whereas Regime Durability is a significant negative predictor in model 2. The results for GDP and Regime Durability run counter to expectations, but it is telling that these counterintuitive results occur in the models with the shorter time series, as previously found. Table 4 presents the results of models 5 through 8, in which the dependent variable, terrorism, is sorted by source country among Middle-Eastern states. As in models 1 through 4, models 5 through 8 provide partial vindication for the strategic school at the expense of the political access school but leave some nagging questions. In Table 4, Democracy (Polity IV) is a consistent, significant positive predictor of terrorist attacks; however, FH Civil Liberties is not. That is to say that more politically liberal regimes in the Middle East, as measured by Polity IV, are more prone to harbor terrorist groups that commit terrorist acts either at home or abroad than are politically illiberal regimes. However, Middle-Eastern states that respect civil liberties\u2014the very same freedoms that pose barriers to state actors who may seek to apprehend terrorists or quash terrorist networks\u2014are no more likely than Middle-Eastern states with poor civil liberties protections to host terrorist groups. This is difficult to reconcile within the confines of the strategic school and either prompts a consideration of Middle-Eastern exceptionalism or a re-conceptualization of the relationship between the self-imposed limitations within democracies fighting terrorism. It may be possible that within the Middle East, mass political participation serves to inhibit governmental efforts to arrest terrorists and disrupt terrorist networks because the significant segments of the public regards them as having a legitimate political agenda. A cases in point would be Yemen, where Al Qaeda militants might enjoy some sympathy from a public that is permitted to participate in albeit incomplete elections. Or, a second possibility is that in countries where public outrage against terrorists has prompted an over-zealous antiterrorism policy from the government that itself fuels terrorist activity and recruitment. The case here would be Turkey, where public outrage against Kurdish Worker Party (PKK) attacks in the 1980s and 1990s facilitated a harsh antiterrorism policy that included torture, arbitrary arrest, detention, and sentencing, and direct military reprisal against Kurdish civilians. These measures on the part of Turkish government security forces enhanced Kurdish support for the PKK\u2019s objectives, thus assisting PKK recruitment, organization of safe houses, and procurement of supplies. Again, in models 5 through 8 state failures is a significant, at times highly significant, positive predictor of the incidence of terrorism. This illustrates that regardless of whether or not the Middle-Eastern state in question is considered to be a target of terrorist attacks or a source of terrorist attacks, terrorists thrive in countries beset with state failures. A few control variables are significant, and again yield results that counter expectations. GDP is a negative predictor of international terrorism in model 5, but is a positive predictor of terrorism in model 8, as is regime durability. Again, it is possible that sample size is responsible for these differences. Finally, all models are re-run omitting the potentially problematic case of Israel\u2013Palestine, producing the results shown in Table 5: Roughly the same results are obtained in the modified data set analyzed in models 9 through 16. Democratic governance seems to be a somewhat consistent positive predictor of terrorism, while in at least one model (model 11), civil liberties protections are a positive predictor of international terrorism by source\u2014given the negative relationship between FH Civil Liberties, an indicator where states exhibiting poor protections of civil rights are scored higher. Some support for the strategic school is found, although no support is evident for the political access school. And State Failures is a nearly perfectly consistent positive predictor of terrorism, regardless of how terrorism is measured or how terrorist attacks are sorted. Population, as a control variable, is significant in two of the models (9 and 11) and is a positive predictor, as expected. However, GDP and Regime Durability continue to exhibit inconsistent and counterintuitive results. Overall, models 9 through 16 dispel the possibility that the results found in Tables 1 and 2\u2014that state failure is the most significant predictor of the incidence of terrorism, while democracy and civil liberties are more weakly associated with terrorist incidents\u2014are a mere product of the inclusion of a set of observations from an outlier case: a combined Israel and Palestine. Conclusion The results of this study are preliminary, but they do not lend support to the hypothesis that fostering democracy in the Middle East will provide a bulwark against terrorism. Rather, the results suggest the opposite: that more liberal Middle-Eastern political systems are actually more susceptible to the threat of terrorism than are the more dictatorial regimes, as predicted by the strategic school approach to the relationship between democracy and terrorism. Furthermore, the result of the study do lend empirical support to the descriptive literature linking failed states to terrorism: those Middle-Eastern states with significant episodes of state failures are more likely to be the target of and the host for terrorists. Because the study examines multiple measurements of terrorism, by target and by source, multiple measures of political liberalization, democratic processes and civil liberties, and includes what is strangely overlooked by other studies of democracy and terrorism, the role played by state failures, it contributes to scholarly understanding of the relationship between terrorism, democracy, and political stability while assessing the potential effectiveness of current antiterrorism policy. These findings have significant policy implications. The results suggests that a foreign policy toward the Middle East constructed around democracy promotion, or around widening of civil liberties, will not reap a significant security dividend in terms of terrorism. Rather, it may exacerbate the problems of terrorism, both within Middle-Eastern states and for other countries targeted by terrorist groups based in Middle-East states. These findings potentially dampen the enthusiasm of some scholars of the Middle East who have hoped that stalled (or nonexistent) efforts at democratization or the widening of rights through the creation of \u201ccivil society\u201d in the Middle East would be revived as the beneficiaries of a new U.S. foreign policy imperative toward the region. For much of the past ten years, the Middle East has lagged far behind every other world region in terms of democratization, as noted previously, and the field of Middle East Studies has vainly searched for signs of nascent democratization among civil society actors in Middle-Eastern countries. This study is the first to lend empirical support to a criticism of democracy-promotion already present within the field of foreign policy research. In his December 2003 article in Foreign Affairs (2003), director of the Democracy and Rule of Law Project for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Thomas Carothers critiques the Bush administration emphasis on democracy-building in the Middle East as a means to preventing terrorism. Although lionizing the principle of promoting democracy in a region so characterized by dictatorial rule\u2014but seriously questioning whether or not the new policy really will really prove to be a departure from the Cold War policy of supporting pro-U.S. dictatorships in the region out of self-interest in the final analysis\u2014Carothers warns that democracy might not prove to be the solid bulwark against terrorism that it is fashioned to be. He notes that democracy-promotion policy in the Middle East relies too heavily on what is essentially a fairly simplistic modernization theory conception of Islamic radicalism, that it is a manifestation of traditional society that can be eradicated through more modern and Western political and social engineering. The roots of radical Islamist movements, on the contrary, are complex, varied and \u201cmultifaceted\u201d Carothers argues, and democracy is not likely to be the cure-all. Moreover, borrowing a page from the strategic school, Carothers warns that democratization might widen the political space for radicals in the Middle East and he regards the histories of newly democratized states as a cautionary tale to those who see rapid democratization as a stabilizing force in Islamic societies. Finally, Carothers observes that democracy, itself is not always a simple panacea for terrorism outside of the Middle East. He specifically notes Spain as a case study: it is a consolidated, though newer, Western democracy that is the target of regular and violent terrorist attacks from the Basque separatist movement, ETA. One could add a host of other established democracies to the list of countries that are either sources for or targets of terrorism: Great Britain, India, Italy, Greece, and the United States.", ""], "id": "0c09788440ec7428743653ce1e87e3bb67bfe0cf2c379cf2efd5af8f91bf7564", "highlighted_text": "democracies are more conducive to terrorist activity than are dictatorships democracy provides greater opportunities for terrorists to join mainstream politics democracies are more tempting targets for terrorism because their respect for civil liberties quality of public responsiveness makes democracies more willing to negotiate with terrorists New democracies possess liabilities inherent in democracies in general, shift toward democratic state to reduce terrori The results of this study do not lend support to the hypothesis that fostering democracy in the Middle East will provide a bulwark against terrorism the results suggest the opposite liberal Middle-Eastern systems are susceptible to terror", "highlights": [[2, 3234, 3309], [2, 4964, 5047], [2, 5457, 5508], [2, 5532, 5573], [2, 6139, 6231], [2, 6638, 6661], [2, 6673, 6720], [2, 9517, 9522], [2, 9537, 9560], [2, 9581, 9598], [2, 41572, 41597], [2, 41624, 41746], [2, 41756, 41788], [2, 41800, 41822], [2, 41833, 41844], [2, 41859, 41873], [2, 41888, 41894]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 60], [2, 186, 219], [2, 220, 398], [2, 471, 771], [2, 3192, 3233], [2, 3234, 3309], [2, 4964, 5047], [2, 5047, 5048], [2, 5457, 5508], [2, 5509, 5531], [2, 5532, 5573], [2, 5574, 5740], [2, 5890, 6032], [2, 6033, 6042], [2, 6043, 6138], [2, 6139, 6231], [2, 6231, 6319], [2, 6638, 6661], [2, 6662, 6672], [2, 6673, 6720], [2, 6721, 6764], [2, 6802, 6905], [2, 6906, 7056], [2, 9513, 9516], [2, 9517, 9522], [2, 9523, 9536], [2, 9537, 9560], [2, 9560, 9580], [2, 9581, 9598], [2, 9598, 10024], [2, 10169, 10182], [2, 10242, 10300], [2, 10381, 10385], [2, 10408, 10471], [2, 17979, 18035], [2, 18303, 18429], [2, 41561, 41571], [2, 41572, 41597], [2, 41624, 41746], [2, 41746, 41755], [2, 41756, 41788], [2, 41788, 41799], [2, 41800, 41822], [2, 41823, 41832], [2, 41833, 41844], [2, 41845, 41858], [2, 41859, 41873], [2, 41874, 41887], [2, 41888, 41894], [2, 41894, 41936], [2, 42847, 43286], [2, 43287, 43334], [2, 43360, 43386], [2, 43453, 43568], [2, 44197, 44270], [2, 44807, 45159], [2, 45178, 45235], [2, 45301, 45380]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2007-04-27"}, {"tag": "Democratization causes civil war", "cite": "Savun 9 (Barcu, Political Science Professor at Pittsburg, \u201cForeign Aid, Democratization, and Civil Conflict: How Does Democracy Aid Affect Civil Conflict?\u201d, 2011, American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 55, No. 2, pp. 233-246)", "body": ["As Cederman, Hug and Krebs (2007) note, most theoretical and empirical treatments of the democratization-conflict link have occurred with a focus on interstate wars. In From Voting to Violence, Snyder (2000) provides one of the first exclusive systematic studies of the link between democratization and civil conflict, particularly ethnic conflicts. Snyder (2000) proposes that during the early phases of the democratization process, two conditions favorable to the initiation of civil conflict emerge: (a) political elites exploit rising nationalism for their own ends to create divisions in the society and (b) the central government is too weak to prevent elites\u2019 polarizing tactics. According to Snyder, before democratization, the public is not politically active and hence its sense of belonging to a nation is relatively weak (35).3 Democratization increases the feeling of nationalism, especially with the provocation of the elites who feel threatened by the arrival of democracy. To maintain or increase their grab on political power, the elites may depict the political opponents and the ethnic minorities as traitors by invoking nationalist sentiments in the public (37).4 These polarizing tactics, in turn, create tensions among ethnic groups and hence increase the risk of violent clashes in the society.5 For example, during 1987 Milosevic skillfully used the Serbian state TV to convince the Serbian minority that Serbs in the Kosovo were suffering discrimination and repression at the hands of the Albanian majority. These kinds of inciting polarizing tactics by Milosevic and the Serbian nationalist elites were pivotal in contributing to violence in Kosovo. Violent struggles in post-communist regimes such as Croatia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia during the 1990s are other examples of nationalist upheavals incited by the domestic political elites during democratization process. Snyder (2000) argues that the elites\u2019 use of exclusionary nationalism is particularly strong and damaging if the democratizing state has weak political institutions. If state institutions are strong, the institutions may be able to deter the elites\u2019 opportunistic behavior and curb its potentially damaging impacts. However, during early phases of democratization, the institutions are usually new and fragile and the central authority is weak. The weakening of central authority gives the elites the opportunity to monopolize the media, create divisions in the society, and control the political discourse. Without the constraints of strong institutions and state authority, the political elites have more leeway to pull the society to any direction their interests dictate. Rustow\u2019s (1970) seminal work on regime transition divides democratization into three phases. In the preparatory phase, a prolonged political struggle representing different interests takes place.6 Polarization of the elites usually ensues in this phase. In such an environment, a weakening of the central authority is inevitable. As the balance of power shifts from the old authority to the new actors in political life, a power vacuum emerges. The transition of power also weakens the state\u2019s monopoly on the use of force as the military usually plays a key (and often independent) role in the democratization process, as was the case in most democratization episodes in Latin America. In addition, the early phase of a regime change usually renders the policing capacity of the state inefficient and thereby increases its vulnerability to attacks by domestic groups. The extant literature on civil war shows that organizationally and politically weak central governments make civil conflicts feasible due to weak local policing and inept counterinsurgency practices (Fearon and Laitin 2003, 75). The weaker the central government, the less likely it is to deter domestic groups from using violence. Weak states also provide the opportunity for rebellion because the rebels\u2019 chances of scoring a victory increase. As the state capacity weakens and questions arise about its legitimacy, the rebels find it easier to recruit and thereby strengthen their base. During democratization, uncertainty also looms large (e.g., Gill 2000; O\u2019Donnell, Schmitter, and Whitehead 1986; Teixeira 2008). As Rustow (1970) puts it, \u201ca new political regime is a novel prescription for taking joint chances on the unknown\u201d (358). Uncertainty of the regime change creates several credible commitment problems. First, the political elites have difficulty in trusting each other\u2019s intentions and promises. As Karl (1990) suggests, during regime transitions political actors \u201cfind it difficult to know what their interests are, who their supporters will be, and which groups will be their allies or opponents\u201d (6). The new political elites and the old regime are wary of each other\u2019s intentions and hence are unlikely to believe that any promises made or concessions given during the transition period will be honored once the central authority and institutions are consolidated. The key problem is that the elites perceive each other as \u201cconditional in their support for democracy and equivocal in their commitment to democratic rules of the game\u201d (Burton, Gunther, and Higley 1992, 31). The \u201cequivocal commitment to democratic rules\u201d increases the level of distrust and suspicion among the elites and thereby increases the risk of collapse of the political rule. Another credibility problem arises between the elites and ethnic groups in the state. The weakening of the state authority, combined with the uncertainty in the environment, increases the sense of insecurity that comes with the transition (Pridham 2000). This insecurity is particularly acute among minority groups who feel unprotected in an environment of nascent institutions, opportunistic elites, a weak state authority, and rising nationalism. Weingast (1997, 1998) formally demonstrates that during fundamental political changes in a society, institutions are typically weak and everything is at stake. This implies two things. First, the mechanisms limiting one ethnic group from using the state apparatus to take advantage of another are not effective. That is, institutions cannot credibly commit to protect the state apparatus from being captured by any group to exploit the other (Weingast 1998). The literature on democratization similarly contends that the new regimes are not usually successful in honoring their commitments and showing self-restraint (e.g., Huntington 1991). Second, since the stakes are high during regime change, the critical threshold probability that breeds violence based on fears of victimization is particularly low (Weingast 1998, 191). That is, it does not take much for the minority group to resort to violence out of its fear. The extant literature on civil wars shows that minority groups are more likely to resort to violence if they fear that there is a risk of annihilation in the future and the commitments made by the state are not credible (e.g., Fearon 1998; Walter 1997, 2002).

While the Democratic Peace has faced many challenges, we believe the most significant challenge has come from the argument that the pacifying effect of democracy is epiphenomenal to territorial issues, specifically the external threats that they pose. This argument sees the lower hazards of armed conflict among democracies not as a product of shared norms or institutional structures, but as a result of settled borders. Territory, though, remains only one geo-political context generating threat, insecurity, and a higher likelihood of armed conflict. Strategic rivalry also serves as an environment associated with fear, a lack of trust, and an expectation of future conflict. Efforts to assess democratic pacifism have largely ignored rivalry as a context conditioning the behavior of democratic leaders. To be sure, research demonstrates rivals to have higher probabilities of armed conflict and democracies rarely to be rivals. But fundamental to the Democratic Peace is the notion that even in the face of difficult security challenges and salient issues, dyadic democracy will associate with a lower likelihood of militarized aggression. But the presence of an external threat, be that threat disputed territory or strategic rivalry, may be the key mechanism by which democratic leaders, owing to audience costs, resolve and electoral pressures, fail to resolve problems nonviolently.", "This study has sought a \u2018\u2018hard test\u2019\u2019 of the Democratic Peace by testing the conditional effects of joint democracy on armed conflict when external threat is present. We test three measures of threat: territorial contention, strategic rivalry, and a threat index that sums the first two measures. For robustness checks, we use two additional measures of our dependent variable: fatal MID onset, and event data from the Armed Conflict Database, which can be found in our Online Appendix. As most studies report, democratic dyads are associated with less armed conflict than mixed-regime and autocratic dyads. In every one of our models, when we control for each measure of external threat, joint democracy is strongly negative and significant and each measure of threat is strongly positive and significant. Here, liberal institutions maintain their pacific ability and external threats clearly increase conflict propensities. However, when we test the interactive relationship between democracy and our measures of external threat, the pacifying effect of democracy is less visible. Park and James (2015) find some evidence that when faced with an external threat in the form of territorial contention, the pacifying effect of joint democracy holds up. This study does not fully support the claims of Park and James (2015). Using a longer timeframe, we find more consistent evidence that when faced with an external threat, be it territorial contention, strategic rivalry, or a combination, democratic pacifism does not survive. What are the implications of our study? First, while it is clear that we do not observe a large amount of armed conflict among democratic states, if we organize interstate relationships along a continuum from highly hostile to highly friendly, we are probably observing what Goertz et al. (2016) and Owsiak et al. (2016) refer to as \u2018\u2018lesser rivalries\u2019\u2019 in which \u2018\u2018both the frequency and severity of violent interaction decline. Yet, the sentiments of threat, enmity, and competition that remain\u2014along with the persistence of unresolved issues\u2014mean that lesser rivalries still experience isolated violent episodes (e.g., militarized interstate disputes), diplomatic hostility, and non-violent crises\u2019\u2019 (Owsiak et al., 2016). Second, our findings show that the pacific benefits of liberal institutions or externalized norms are not always able to lower the likelihood of armed conflict when faced with external threats, whether those hazards are disputed territory, strategic rivalry, or a combination of the two. The structural environment clearly influences democratic leaders in their foreign policy actions more than has heretofore been appreciated. Audience costs, resolve, and electoral pressures, produced from external threats, are powerful forces that are present even in jointly democratic relationships. These forces make it difficult for leaders to trust one another, which inhibits conflict resolution and facilitates persistent hostility. It does appear, then, that there is a limit to the Democratic Peace."], "id": "277eb61da7835f1f44184c32128b4aa69560344d83a305b2844900ca99cd3178", "highlighted_text": "the pacifying effect of democracy is epiphenomenal to territorial issues Efforts to assess democratic pacifism ignored rivalry democratic leaders fail to resolve problems nonviolently when we test the interactive relationship between democracy and external threat, the pacifying effect is less visible liberal institutions or norms are not able to lower the likelihood of conflict Audience costs , resolve , and electoral pressures are powerful forces present even in jointly democratic relationships make it difficult for leaders to trust one another , which inhibits conflict resolution and facilitates persistent hostility", "highlights": [[2, 217, 253], [2, 254, 289], [2, 770, 807], [2, 821, 836], [2, 1366, 1384], [2, 1444, 1481], [3, 935, 951], [3, 952, 976], [3, 977, 998], [3, 1015, 1052], [3, 1066, 1068], [3, 1069, 1081], [3, 2309, 2329], [3, 2330, 2332], [3, 2346, 2351], [3, 2352, 2355], [3, 2356, 2359], [3, 2367, 2398], [3, 2405, 2413], [3, 2682, 2696], [3, 2696, 2697], [3, 2698, 2705], [3, 2705, 2710], [3, 2711, 2730], [3, 2764, 2767], [3, 2768, 2783], [3, 2793, 2841], [3, 2856, 2888], [3, 2889, 2906], [3, 2906, 2913], [3, 2914, 2942], [3, 2943, 2969], [3, 2970, 2979]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 15], [2, 16, 29], [2, 30, 87], [2, 95, 141], [2, 154, 216], [2, 217, 253], [2, 254, 289], [2, 289, 339], [2, 341, 413], [2, 414, 417], [2, 418, 484], [2, 485, 510], [2, 770, 807], [2, 808, 820], [2, 821, 836], [2, 837, 897], [2, 1028, 1258], [2, 1259, 1274], [2, 1274, 1365], [2, 1366, 1384], [2, 1384, 1394], [2, 1395, 1409], [2, 1409, 1410], [2, 1411, 1418], [2, 1419, 1422], [2, 1423, 1442], [2, 1442, 1443], [2, 1444, 1481], [3, 0, 165], [3, 297, 442], [3, 869, 924], [3, 935, 951], [3, 952, 976], [3, 977, 998], [3, 999, 1014], [3, 1015, 1052], [3, 1053, 1065], [3, 1066, 1068], [3, 1069, 1081], [3, 1324, 1362], [3, 1363, 1382], [3, 1383, 1490], [3, 1491, 1527], [3, 2285, 2308], [3, 2309, 2329], [3, 2330, 2332], [3, 2333, 2345], [3, 2346, 2351], [3, 2352, 2355], [3, 2356, 2359], [3, 2360, 2366], [3, 2367, 2398], [3, 2399, 2404], [3, 2405, 2413], [3, 2414, 2540], [3, 2682, 2696], [3, 2696, 2697], [3, 2698, 2705], [3, 2705, 2710], [3, 2711, 2730], [3, 2730, 2763], [3, 2764, 2767], [3, 2768, 2783], [3, 2784, 2792], [3, 2793, 2841], [3, 2843, 2855], [3, 2856, 2888], [3, 2889, 2906], [3, 2906, 2913], [3, 2914, 2942], [3, 2943, 2969], [3, 2970, 2979], [3, 2981, 2995], [3, 3003, 3018], [3, 3019, 3024], [3, 3025, 3048]], "emphasis": [[2, 16, 29], [2, 254, 289], [2, 414, 417], [2, 485, 510], [2, 821, 836], [2, 1259, 1274], [2, 1395, 1409], [2, 1411, 1418], [2, 1423, 1442], [2, 1444, 1481], [3, 952, 976], [3, 1069, 1081], [3, 1363, 1382], [3, 1491, 1527], [3, 2309, 2329], [3, 2346, 2351], [3, 2356, 2359], [3, 2682, 2696], [3, 2698, 2705], [3, 2711, 2730], [3, 2768, 2783], [3, 2889, 2906], [3, 2914, 2942], [3, 2970, 2979], [3, 3019, 3024]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "Corruption", "cite": "Fischer 11/1 Max Fisher writes The Interpreter, a news column and newsletter that explore the ideas and context behind major world events.

The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil looks too similar to the wave of right-wing, anti-establishment populism sweeping Europe and the United States to be dismissed as coincidence. Mr. Bolsonaro, known for praising his country\u2019s former military dictatorship and insulting minorities and women, has championed anger at Brazil\u2019s establishment by promising strong-fisted rule. Underscoring the sense of a global shift, within hours of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s longtime chancellor and pillar of European stability, announced she would not seek re-election. Yet there is no obvious link between Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise and that of Western populists. Figures like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and German populist parties rose by railing against the European Union and immigration, neither of them issues in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro rode a backlash against corruption and crime epidemics that are distinctly Latin American. Maybe Brazil\u2019s election, along with the rest of the populist trend, represents something more disruptive than a single wave with a single point of origin. Research suggests it exemplifies weaknesses and tensions inherent to liberal democracy itself \u2014 and that, in times of stress, can pull it apart. When that happens, voters tend to reject that system in all but name and follow their most basic human instincts toward older styles of government: majoritarian, strong-fisted, us-versus-them rule. It\u2019s a pattern that might feel shocking or new in the West, but is all too familiar in Latin America, which has experienced several populist surges like the one that elevated Mr. Bolsonaro. \u201cMost attempts at democracy end in a return to authoritarian rule,\u201d Jay Ulfelder, a political scientist, wrote in 2012 as elected populists in Venezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua rolled back rights in ways that look familiar today. At the time, most experts blamed issues specific to that region and that moment. But Mr. Ulfelder countered, \u201cI think we get a lot farther if we think of these regimes as the end state toward which most attempts at democracy will slide.\u201d When Democracy Doesn\u2019t Work as Imagined There is a gap between how liberal democracy, which protects individual rights and rule of law, is sold and how it works. It is often portrayed as rule by the people. But, in practice, elections and public sentiment are meant to be only part of a system governed by institutions and norms that protect the common good. That gap is often where the problems begin. When institutions fall short, as they did in Brazil, voters can grow skeptical of the entire idea of accruing power to bureaucrats and elites who failed in ways that highlight the gap. So voters move to replace institutions with a style of government that feels more like democracy as they\u2019d thought it would be: direct rule by the people. That often means electing leaders like Mr. Bolsonaro, who promise to dismantle the establishment and rule through personal authority. In practice, such leaders tend to consolidate power for themselves, as Silvio Berlusconi did after riding to power in Italy on a wave of outrage against corruption. He seized control of state bureaucracies, stalling their once-promising progress, and replaced the old system of patronage with a new one loyal to him. Defying Popular Will Sometimes an anti-establishment backlash comes when there really is a deep rot in the system, as in Brazil or Italy. But it can also come when governments do things that are simply unpopular. This has driven much of the instability in Europe, where leaders see eurozone and immigration reforms as essential to Europe\u2019s long-term survival. But those measures are unpopular with voters, bringing a spark of realization that the system is engineered to, at times, ignore what they want. No one wants to believe their leaders are defying their wishes because a functioning democracy requires checks on public demand. It is easier to see those leaders as serving some other, unseen constituency. This creates an opening for a canny outsider to rise to power by scapegoating foreign or moneyed interests \u2014 the liberal philanthropist George Soros is a popular target \u2014 and by promising to restore the people\u2019s will. The European Union, which never managed an identity that wasn\u2019t associated with bankers and technocrats, has been easy to cast as an enemy of popular will. Establishment parties, closely tied to that project, have collapsed. In Latin America, institutional failures were graver, with corruption rotting out political parties. Voters were aware of this corruption because justice systems had grown strong enough to root it out. A technocrat would say this showed the need for even stronger and more independent institutions. But to voters, it felt like an indictment of the entire system \u2014 a reason to tear it down and elevate someone who could impose order. That is not so different from what happened in the United States, where party officials became seen as unresponsive and beholden to moneyed interests. President Trump rose in part by arguing that his wealth granted him independence \u2014 though, in practice, he has empowered industry insiders \u2014 and by promising policies that party leaders had considered too extreme. Craving Majority Rule Populist backlashes, even if they focus on distant elites, tend to emerge as a desire for majority rule, which feels democratic to members of the majority \u2014 and, in certain circumstances, like a matter of life and death. Human beings are tribal by nature. Our instincts are to put our group first and see ourselves as locked in competition with other groups. Liberal democracy, which promises that everyone gains when rights are protected for all, asks us to suppress those impulses. But this is no easy ask. And tribal instincts tend to come to the fore in times of scarcity or insecurity, when our capacity for lofty ideals and long-term planning is weakest. When people believe they are at risk of targeted violence, their sense of community narrows, according to research by Daphna Canetti-Nisim, a University of Maryland political psychologist. They grow more supportive of policies to control minorities and less supportive of pluralism or democracy. Those impulses can be exploited. The grisly campaign of state-sanctioned vigilante violence by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines pins his country\u2019s problems on an undesirable social class \u2014 in his telling, a vast army of drug dealers and users \u2014 and promises to control them through force. Mr. Bolsonaro has promised his own extrajudicial war on drugs. Such tactics work best when rallying a majority group. Liberal democracy, for all its protections of minorities, still delegates power by elections that favor whoever has the numbers. In Europe and the United States, this has meant encouraging a subtle but unmistakable sense that white Christians are under siege. White voters have grown more defensive of their whiteness and afraid of minorities, tempting them to see democracy as a zero-sum struggle. Imposing Equality A three-country study led by Marta Marchlewska of the Polish Academy of Sciences found that the trouble often starts when members of a particular social group believe their group is declining in status relative to others. This makes members of that group care much more about their group identity \u2014 and see people outside of it as threats. This can lead to a politics of us-versus-them, in which the ideals of liberal democracy feel like foolhardy surrender. Liberal democracy is designed to flatten out social hierarchies, making this kind of majoritarian backlash all but inevitable. This helped lead Poland\u2019s Catholics, a once-dominant group, to support a political party that had promised to subvert the courts. It may have also led European and American whites who feared losing what they viewed as their special place in society to support populist leaders who promised to control immigrants and minorities, and led middle-class Brazilians to crave harsh policing of poor communities. Liberal democracy comes with features like independent courts and constitutional protections meant to check tribalist impulses and impose equality. But to the people whose impulses are being checked, those features can feel tyrannical. A populist\u2019s promise to tear them down feels like freedom, though that is rarely what it brings. Scholars are still struggling to understand what will happen to democracy, whose growth stalled over a decade ago and may now be receding. Brazil hints at one possibility. Latin America\u2019s experience \u2014 with voters pulling their countries between periods of fuller democracy and populist strongman rule \u2014 may be the natural default. The West\u2019s half century of democratic stability may have been the exception, a byproduct of Cold War power rivalries. We had long thought that democracies in regions like Latin America or Southeast Asia would catch up to those in the West. And maybe they will. Or maybe we had it backward all along.", ""], "id": "38612f3ab89170c799643527f120f031e7a21526698f338871deb1f190b3d267", "highlighted_text": "The election o Jair in Brazil looks similar to right-wing populism sweeping Europe and the United States Research suggests it exemplifies weaknesses and tensions inherent to democracy itself that can pull it apart.

Meanwhile in Brazil, the drama of the judiciary\u2019s years-long corruption investigations continued to play out, as former president and then-presidential front-runner Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva spent the summer contesting his conviction on corruption and money-laundering charges. Most recently, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales raised international alarms when he sent army tanks to the headquarters of the United Nations-backed Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), ending the anti-graft body\u2019s mandate in dramatic fashion. But the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Guatemala City are surprisingly quiet. While more than a million Brazilians took to the streets to protest corruption in 2016, and protests by thousands in Guatemala in favor of the CICIG in 2017 forced Morales to reverse an earlier decision to expel the commission, recent protests have been considerably smaller. Latin Americans, it seems, are growing tired of their countries\u2019 never-ending stream of corruption scandals. This could spell disaster for the region\u2019s anti-corruption crusaders. Latin American countries have made notable strides in fighting corruption over the past few years. Changes to the region\u2019s legal systems have made the judicial system more transparent, and new corruption fighting tools, like plea deals and specific anti-corruption measures, have allowed prosecutors to go after corrupt officials and uncover cases of bribery like never before. These successes, however, represent a double-edged sword. As each new case helps illuminate the scale of corruption in Latin American politics, the resulting never-ending media coverage of corruption scandals is testing citizens\u2019 patience and confidence. The result is what sociologist Silvio Waisbord refers to as \u201cscandal fatigue.\u201d While the first revelations of corruption may mobilize the public to protest against official wrongdoing, subsequent coverage can actually foster apathy. Constant revelations of wrongdoing can create the perception among the public that misbehavior is the norm rather than an anomaly deserving of special punishment. Citizens become increasingly ambivalent, rather than outraged, at wrongdoings. Take, for example, the case of Brazil. When Brazil\u2019s federal prosecutors launched \u201cOperation Car Wash,\u201d an investigation into bribes paid by the country\u2019s largest construction firm, Odebrecht, to governments across Latin America, in 2014, the ensuing scandals prompted millions of Brazilians to take to the streets to protest the rot uncovered in their political system. Public outrage and continued conversation forced the judiciary and the legislature to hold the accused accountable; as of August 2018, more than 200 politicians and business leaders have been convicted for bribery and money laundering. But after four years of non-stop media coverage of corruption by local and national politicians, Brazilians seem too tired to care about the misdeeds of officials that they have long assumed to be corrupt anyway. Although most international media has covered Lula\u2019s conviction as a main story of the country\u2019s 2018 presidential election, polls show that ordinary Brazilians are more concerned about issues that affect their daily life, like violence, unemployment, and the economy. This situation is not unique to Brazil. The \u201cnotebooks\u201d scandal has already faded from Argentina\u2019s front pages, and experts predict that the scandal will have little effect on the Kirchners\u2019 party\u2019s chances in the country\u2019s 2019 presidential election. The picture is not all bleak: in September 2018, Colombia\u2019s new president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, joined the political opposition to promote a national referendum on anti-corruption reforms. While turnout was not high enough to enact any of the ballot measures as law, the mobilization of 11.6 million voters has given the referendum\u2019s backers a strong mandate to push the reforms through Congress. Weeks later, Peru\u2019s President Martin Vizcarra announced that he intends to hold a similar referendum. Even Brazilians can be heartened knowing that corruption scandals have spurred a new generation of candidates to run for office on the congressional level and face their country\u2019s corrupt ruling class head-on. But those fighting corruption in Latin America need the public to continue to push for anti-corruption legislation and hold their governments accountable. Tackling Latin America\u2019s corruption problem will be a slow process; successes in other countries, like Georgia and Rwanda, took decades to achieve. Latin America is on the right track, but it can only stay on this path if its citizens don\u2019t fall asleep at the wheel.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991). Such examples provide support that the United States rarely suspends military assistance in the face of its security imperatives.

For example, while sub-Saharan Africa received $714 billion in development aid from 1960 to 2006 (Easterly 2008, 14), its per capita income grew by less than 1 percent per year over this period,2 and its poverty rate has scarcely changed (Chen and Ravallion 2004). These grim statistics beg the question: Why has develop-ment aid failed to achieve its goals? One possible answer is that it is simply not used for its intended purpose. Research shows that aid is fungible (Feyzioglu, Swaroop, and Zhu 1998): that is, aid given for one purpose allows governments to shift resources to other uses. If these other uses do not encourage economic growth or development, neither will aid. A recent New York Times article on Uganda illustrates this point.3 Although Uganda has received considerable foreign aid designated for health care, its hospitals remain starved for resources. This is because foreign aid has allowed the government to cut its own health care spending: specifically, for each additional aid dollar received, Uganda cut its health care spending by 57 cents (IHME 2010). Although it is not clear where the budgetary savings went, a concurrent rise in military spending suggests that Uganda exploited its development aid to reallocate funds from health care to the mili-tary. If so, it is no surprise that this aid did li le to improve the lives of Uganda\u2019s people. The Uganda example suggests that governments may, more generally, divert aid funds from developmental uses to military spending. This would be disturbing in at least two ways. First, military spending does not promote development: studies show that its impact on growth is nonexistent at best and negative at worst (Dunne and Uye 2009). Second, military resources are often used to repress domestic dissent. For example, in the \u201cArab Spring\u201d of 2011, governments across the Middle East and North Africa used their armed forces to intimidate prodemocracy protesters. If development aid is gener-ally diverted to military spending, it could thus have pernicious economic and political e\ufb00ects.", ""], "id": "2d8bf430421a301c824adb52bc84aa5bea6ce88286b210796fdfb7dc571fd070", "highlighted_text": "rich countries gave three trillion in development aid return has been poor: it is not used for its intended purpose Uganda received aid designated for health Uganda exploited its development aid to reallocate funds from health care to the mili-tary governments divert aid funds to military spending.", "highlights": [[2, 23, 42], [2, 63, 77], [2, 86, 104], [2, 111, 117], [2, 137, 151], [2, 673, 678], [2, 686, 719], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1770, 1791]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 22], [2, 23, 42], [2, 43, 62], [2, 63, 77], [2, 78, 85], [2, 86, 104], [2, 104, 110], [2, 111, 117], [2, 118, 136], [2, 137, 151], [2, 152, 254], [2, 254, 267], [2, 268, 287], [2, 591, 607], [2, 607, 611], [2, 612, 672], [2, 673, 678], [2, 679, 685], [2, 686, 719], [2, 719, 758], [2, 758, 767], [2, 767, 967], [2, 968, 1002], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1010, 1054], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1064, 1084], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1111, 1160], [2, 1369, 1480], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1571, 1572], [2, 1663, 1695], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1708, 1728], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1746, 1769], [2, 1770, 1791]], "emphasis": [[2, 23, 42], [2, 63, 77], [2, 86, 104], [2, 111, 117], [2, 137, 151], [2, 673, 678], [2, 686, 719], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1770, 1791]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 21]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-01"}, {"tag": "Russia Fill In", "cite": "Barmin 18 Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

", "body": ["Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to power in Russia in 2012 signified a dramatic change in the country\u2019s foreign policy and military strategy. Scrapping the achievements of the Dmitry Medvedev era in the Kremlin, which was characterized by a thaw in relations with the West, Vladimir Putin opted for a more aggressive approach toward positioning the country in the international arena. Experts still argue what prompted this review of the country\u2019s foreign policy strategy, but the developments that likely had a major impact on Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy planning in 2012 included the war with Georgia in 2008, the Arab Spring protests, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) infamous military campaign in Libya, which brought down Russia\u2019s long-time ally Muammar Qaddafi. Contours of the new policy approach to the region started to emerge when Russia updated two of its key documents, the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation and the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.[i] The documents pronounced strategies based on protecting Russian national interests abroad, including militarily if need be, and increasing Moscow\u2019s role in maintaining global security. Quite notably, a more recent edition of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, signed by President Putin in November 2016, has a specific focus on the Middle East and names foreign meddling there as one of the causes of instability and extremism in the region that directly affect Russia.[ii] The statement that serves as de facto justification for the Russian military campaign in Syria became the first official document to elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East and North Africa. In the three years that divide the two concepts, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to foreign policy experienced an evolution and increasing securitization (the word \u201cterrorism\u201d figures 15 times in the 2013 Concept and 35 in its 2016 edition). The Foreign Policy Concept also spells out the Russian president\u2019s growing ambition to deal with instability where it originates before it reaches Russian borders. The rationale behind Russia\u2019s re-emergence as one of the leading powers in the Middle East was of a defensive nature and largely reactionary. The Arab Spring movement in the region was a painful reminder of the Color Revolutions that broke out across several post-Soviet states in the first half of the 2000s and, according to the Kremlin, led to the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself is of the belief that that the Arab Spring is a continuation of those Color Revolutions and that both are foreign-instigated.[iii] Coupled with a forced revolution in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi in what Russia declared was a violation of international law, this episode is often cited as a watershed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking.[iv] A wave of revolutions across Eurasia convinced the Russian leadership that the apparent domino effect of regime change would eventually target Russia. It is not a coincidence that the Russian president likens Color Revolutions and the Arab Spring protests to each other and often makes no distinction between them. Commenting on anti-corruption protests in Russia in March 2017, he went as far as to call them \u201can instrument of the Arab Spring.\u201d[v] Vladimir Putin sees Russia as a legitimate actor in designing a new power balance in the Middle East and as its integral part since security challenges originating in the region reverberate across the former Soviet space as well as in Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is an outsider in this region in the view of Russian officials. Criticism of the White House over its \u201cdestructive\u201d role in the Middle East is a central theme of many of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speeches, including the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly prior to launching his military campaign in Syria in September 2015. In those remarks, the Russian president accused the United States of being the source of problems in the Middle East.[vi] A gradual withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East under Barack Obama among other things meant that the region\u2019s \u201cpoliceman\u201d was no longer interested in maintaining order there, which arguably presented Moscow with numerous security challenges. Russia\u2019s re-emergence in the Middle East to a large extent happened to fill some of the void left by the retreating Obama administration. In some cases it happened effortlessly, such as in Egypt, where the US decision to cut aid to Cairo in 2013 led to the emergence of a budding Russia-Egypt alliance. In other contexts, most prominently in Syria, Russia had to invest significant diplomatic and military resources to marginalize the US in the war and in the peace process. What started out as an attempt to replace the United States where it was no longer interested in playing a leading role later transformed into an ambition to challenge the US even where it had no intention of retreating, for instance in the Gulf region. Russia\u2019s return to the Middle East differs from the Soviet experience: Today, Moscow is extending its reach without the baggage of Soviet ideology. The idea of using its arms exports to the Middle East in the ideological struggle against the West evaporated as soon as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) disintegrated and was replaced with the idea of making a profit for the cash-strapped budget. The Kremlin is looking to support its geopolitical claims with a strong pragmatic dimension. In the Middle East, Moscow to reinforce its influence there as well as offset the burden upon the Russian federal budget associated with the expenses of the Syrian campaign. Following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, Russia has used arms deals to reach out to Cold War\u2013era allies in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance. During the Cold War, Wynfred Joshua and Stephen P. Gilbert wrote that as more countries became recipients of Soviet military aid programs, there was a tendency for these countries to become greater political allies of the Soviet Union.[vii] And it seems that this argument is increasingly relevant today. According to SIPRI, in 2015 $5.5 billion in Russian arms exports were destined for clients in the Middle East, which was ten times more than all Russian experts to the region for all of the 1990s.[viii] With Vladimir Putin declaring victory over the Islamic State during his December 2017 visit to Syria, Russia is faced with a number of opportunities as well as challenges. Its military operation in Syria may have put Russia back on the radar in the Middle East; but in all certainty, it essentially solidified its position in the region. As Vladimir Putin is eyeing re-election as president in March 2018, foreign policy achievements, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, figure prominently in his election campaign rhetoric. One of the effects of Russia\u2019s assertive foreign policy has become an expectation from regional partners and opponents alike that Moscow will be active in the Middle East. However, the hard power that brought Russia to prominence in the region will not be a helpful tool to support long-term influence there and could, in fact, produce a negative impact for Russia\u2019s international standing. As a result, during his next term in office, Vladimir Putin will be faced with a challenge to depart from hard power, his preferred modus operandi, to embrace a spectrum of other tools in order to make Russia\u2019s presence in the region lasting and sustainable.", ""], "id": "aeb68bd2a26052856096ac0b1aa3dd63faeb9bb8f49e59b42ace7250a60dec2e", "highlighted_text": "Putin has a specific focus on the Middle East The statement elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East Putin sees Russia designing a new power balance in the Middle East gradual withdrawal of the United States Russia\u2019s re-emergence to fill the void Russia has used arms deals to Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria Moscow will be active in the Middle East", "highlights": [[2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 7105, 7145]], "underlines": [[2, 9, 132], [2, 1230, 1328], [2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1335, 1352], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1393, 1522], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1537, 1655], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 2915, 3064], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3391, 3415], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4091, 4092], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4133, 4347], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4370, 4415], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4424, 4431], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 4441, 4484], [2, 5580, 5639], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5832, 5867], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 5897, 5931], [2, 6975, 7104], [2, 7105, 7145]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [7, 9], [15, 21], [21, 22], [23, 27]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-08"}, {"tag": "That turns case and offers no chance of reform", "cite": "Barmin 18 Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there.", ""], "id": "3ce728fb544578ca4e2586184951be1792bae27a88b9d921d2863d1a6304cc67", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

Russia\u2019s efforts to court Egypt, for example, have a different meaning in the White House and the Kremlin if the risk of a US-Russia conflict is \u201cgrowing,\u201d as does Moscow\u2019s new naval access agreement with Cyprus. Russia\u2019s arms sales to Iran \u2014 and US pursuit of the nuclear agreement \u2014 similarly take on additional flavor. Over time, this dynamic could increasingly lead Washington to lobby its partners in the Middle East to choose sides by limiting their cooperation with Moscow. (Since Russia is the weaker party and has comparatively limited leverage, it has little to gain from this approach and would more probably continue its attempts to exploit frustration with America to cultivate individual governments.) The United States would be in the strongest position to discourage interaction with Russia in dealing with the governments most dependent on its protection, for example, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. That said, if the United States looks less willing to exercise its power, its partners will be less dependent and less subject to such pressure. Conversely, as US military planners see a greater risk of conflict with Russia, they will generate pressure inside the US government to place greater value on existing alliance relationships and partnerships around the world. Here, governments hosting major military bases might find that they have new influence in dealing with Washington. In the Middle East, this would apply especially to countries with US naval and air bases that would be necessary to interdict Russian forces in any conflict (also the Arab Gulf nations) \u2014 again, recognizing that this is currently a remote possibility. During the Cold War, this dynamic generally reduced official US scrutiny of its partners\u2019 domestic practices, something both President Barack Obama and former President George W.

With its poor record on human rights and ongoing crackdowns on rights activists in the name of national security, China is hardly in a position to lecture others on injustice: under Xi Jinping\u2019s heavy thumb, torture remains a commonly used interrogation method, civil society organizations are being dismantled at a rapid pace, and freedom of the press is at an all-time low. It should come as no surprise that, at least for people whose human rights have been violated by Beijing and its partners, Wang\u2019s statement rang hollow. Unfortunately, China\u2019s hypocrisy is not limited to its own territory: Beijing has no scruple maintaining relationships with some of the most repressive regimes on the planet, empowering them to crush their own dissenters with its help. While Beijing\u2019s partnership with North Korea and Kim Jong-un is currently in the international spotlight, China has long gotten away with backing dictators in Africa with far less attention. The calculus is simple: in exchange for the resources required for China\u2019s sustained economic growth, the Chinese government provides cash, weapons, and even diplomatic cover for its oppressive African partners. All the while, Chinese government rhetoric claims to stand for historical justice and the betterment of third countries through development. Robert Mugabe is a trademark example of this dynamic at work. Despite Mugabe\u2019s appalling human rights record and repeated calls for him to stand trial for crimes against humanity in Zimbabwe, China has sought to foster a strong relationship with his regime. Beijing chooses to cozy up to the nonagenarian on account of his country\u2019s plentiful reserves of copper, platinum and diamonds. Given Mugabe\u2019s economic isolation and poisonous reputation among Western countries, this outside support could not be more vital to his regime. China invested $4 billion in Zimbabwe last year, and was Harare\u2019s largest trading partner in 2015. Meanwhile, Mugabe\u2019s policies have destroyed the economy and the living standards of average citizens. The poverty rate in Zimbabwe now stands at 63% but it can go as high as 90% among rural farming communities. While more than happy to highlight the plight of the Palestinians, Beijing has been suspiciously silent about the suffering of Zimbabweans. In fact, China describes itself as Zimbabwe\u2019s \u201call weather friend.\u201d On top of its steadfast support, China even has sought to stroke Mugabe\u2019s ego by awarding him the Confucius Prize, the Middle Kingdom\u2019s own bizarre version of the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2015. The Chinese government responds to accusations that it enables Mugabe\u2019s oppression with its trademark cynicism. By claiming to be \u201capolitical\u201d\u2014not getting involved in other countries\u2019 internal affairs\u2014Beijing absolves itself of all guilt. Indeed, China\u2019s foreign policy decisions are apparently guided solely by economic self-interest. Beijing\u2019s aid and investment model seeks to maximize profits by taking norms and values out of the equation. Unburdened by ethical concerns, China is happy to disregard crimes committed by the regimes it does business with, so long as the returns are substantial. This position was infamously epitomized by former Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong, who stated \u201cbusiness is business\u201d in response to international criticism that China\u2019s aid and investments in Africa only help to strengthen dictatorial regimes. Unsurprisingly, a growing number of African leaders look on the Chinese approach to aid and investment with relish. Even those who have established lucrative relationships with the West, like Djibouti, are willing to sign up for Chinese monetary incentives and collaborate with its geostrategic goals. Beijing has built its first military base abroad in Djibouti, choosing real estate in close proximity to an existing American naval facility. US concerns over this proximity have been ignored, perhaps because of China\u2019s conveniently-timed investment in a new $4 billion railway linkbetween Djibouti and Ethiopia. Washington is worried Beijing could use its base in the country to freeze out other powers and cement its strategic and economic foothold in the region, but China\u2019s generosity has already won over longtime leader Ismail Omar Guelleh. In addition to investing billions in Djibouti, China is the country\u2019s primary lender at non-concessional rates. With China\u2019s support, the autocratic President Guelleh has been emboldened to curb the democratic process and basic civil freedoms, attacking his political rivals with lethal force or otherwise forcing them into exile to maintain a firm grip on power. Thus far, things have gone well: with his opponents silenced, Guelleh was able to win a fourth term last year. Across Africa, this is becoming a pattern. By prioritizing profit and political expediency, Chinese government investments and partnerships actively enable democratic failures and rights abuses.

The illegitimacy of the current US State Department fits in well with the overall Constitution-circumventing empire that the American Republic has degenerated into.

Recently she issued a dangerously irresponsible \"warning\" to Venezuela and Bolivia regarding their stately relations with Iran. While America has the right to mediate its own associations with foreign nations, one is confounded trying to understand what gives America the right to dictate such associations to other sovereign nations. Of course, the self-declared imperial mandate the US State Department bestowed upon itself brings such \"warnings\" into perspective with the realization that the globalists view no nation as sovereign and all nations beholden to their unipolar \"international system.\" If only the US State Department's meddling was confined to hubris-filled statements given behind podiums attempting to fulfill outlandish mission statements, we could all rest easier.

Following the rhetorical claims of donors, most studies assume that donors will sanction all repressive states equally. In reality, aid sanctions are applied selectively to some human rights violators but not to others. Aid sanctions are rarely if ever applied to countries that are donor allies or have other strong political connections to donor countries. The theoretical literature has recognized that some states might avoid aid sanctions because of their connections to donors (Tomasevski 1997:21) but this insight has not informed quantitative studies of aid sanctions (for an exception, see Barratt 2008). The second misconception of the existing studies is that donors impose blanket sanctions that reduce all types of aid. Past scholarship has overlooked sanctions episodes by failing to recognize that donors typically withdraw aid for economic sectors but continue to extend aid for basic social services and human rights protection. The remainder of this section describes these two points in more detail. I start from a simple set of state-centered, rationalist assumptions to argue that aid donors will apply aid sanctions selectively. The literature linking human rights and foreign aid has largely avoided reference to the dominant theoretical trends of IR theory (for exceptions, see Lai 2003; Barratt 2008). Breaking with this tradition, I explicitly develop a rationalist theory of selective aid sanctions and contrast it to alternative explanations inspired by Constructivism. Starting from the assumption that aid donors are allocating aid in ways that serve their self-interest and security, I first identify situations where aid recipients will not face aid sanctions when they violate human rights. Most obviously, donors rarely apply aid sanctions to states with which they have important strategic ties, such as military alliances. The reason for this is intuitive; aid is often used to buy influence abroad (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith 2009) and withdrawing aid puts these important strategic relationships in jeopardy. Less formal political ties also protect some repressive states from aid sanctions, including the willingness of developing countries to trade United Nations votes for aid (Dreher, Sturm and Vreeland 2009). States that rotate onto the UN Security Council receive roughly 60% more US aid relative to other countries, presumably because of their enhanced ability to assist US interests (Kuziemko and Werker 2006). There are even circumstances where donors might increase aid to repressive allies. Regimes often violate human rights because they face increased pressure from political opposition (Davenport 2000; Vreeland 2008) so donors friendly to the regime may increase aid flows to help the allied regime stay in power. This leads to the first hypothesis."], "id": "7321baf9950a1136c9c7d239bf770773c1e5c8e7f3c3753d13e702b8e0a1ce64", "highlighted_text": "states avoid sanctions because of their connections to donors donors withdraw aid for economic sectors donors apply sanctions selectively. allocating aid in ways that serve self-interest and security donors rarely apply sanctions to states with important strategic ties, such as military alliances aid is used to buy influence abroad withdrawing aid puts important strategic relationships in jeopardy.

Yet, policy-oriented reflections on the record of sanctions turn out to be discouraging. Economic sanctions do not produce regime change, and entail certain potential and acknowledged disadvantages.23 Suffering as a result of economic sanctions could contribute to labour unrest, further repression and the like. Moreover, informed leaders, at various times, have expressed scepticism about sanctions. A prominent example is the opposition of President George H.W. Bush to economic sanctions against China in the aftermath of Tian\u2019anmen Square in 1989, on the grounds of their probable ineffectiveness.24 Consider the US\u2019s rate of success (i.e., change in policy by a target government) from applying sanctions: 1980\u20131989\u201414%; 1990\u20131999\u201426%.25 The figures for unilateral US implementation of economic sanctions are even lower. Longstanding cases like Cuba, Iran, and North Korea demonstrate that, whether regime change specifically or human rights in general are deemed most relevant, economic sanctions remain ineffective. Hufbauer and Oegg observe in particular that arms embargoes are \u2018debatable\u2019 as a means towards ending conflict. With a focus on state repression and economic sanctions, Wood analyses annual data for 157 states from 1976 to 2001,26 and finds that sanctions implemented by the US are associated with higher levels of government repression. Results from Peksen and Drury, meanwhile, link economic sanctions to lower levels of government respect for physical integrity rights and higher levels of repression over comparable periods.27 In short, it is difficult to envision economic sanctions, by the US alone or in conjunction with others, as an appropriate means towards greater respect for human rights abroad.

In this way, the war on terror is privatized, the American economy is bled dry, and the military-security industrial complex makes a killing \u2014 literally and figuratively speaking. The war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan has already cost taxpayers  and could go as high as $4.4 trillion before it\u2019s all over. At least $31 billion (and as much as $60 billion or more) of that $2 trillion was  by military contractors, who do everything from janitorial and food service work to construction, security and intelligence \u2014 jobs that used to be handled by the military. That translates to a loss of  since the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan. To put it another way, the government is spending more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety.

For those signing on for contractor work, many of whom are hired by private contracting firms after serving stints in the military, it is a lucrative, albeit dangerous, career path (private contractors are 2.75 times  than troops). Incredibly, while base pay for an American soldier hovers somewhere around $19,000 per year, contractors are reportedly pulling in between . The exact number of military contractors on the U.S. payroll is hard to pin down, thanks to sleight-of-hand accounting by the Department of Defense and its contractors. However, according to a Wartime Contracting Commission report released in August 2011, there are  in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than the number of ground troops .

Then there was the $300 million diesel power plant that was built despite the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be used regularly \u201cbecause its fuel cost more than the Afghan government could afford to run it regularly.\u201d RWA, a group of three Afghan contractors, was selected to build a 17.5 mile paved road in Ghazni province.

Riyadh's contentious policies\u2014like the war in Yemen and the rift with its neighbors\u2014have constrained its options and inadvertently reinforced Saudi Arabia's need for U.S. military and political support, including security cooperation and intelligence sharing. Prince Mohammed's legacy and perhaps even power is presently tied to two initiatives: The Yemen war and Vision 2030\u2014an ambitious program of social and economic reforms that Riyadh plans to institute to diversify its economy. Neither objective is apparently proceeding as the crown prince had hoped. And to succeed, they will likely require continued U.S. support. Until recently, President Trump was not inclined to use these developments as leverage. Instead, he stood by the crown prince even as U.S. military support to Saudi forces in Yemen\u2014including aerial refueling and advising on intelligence sharing and targeting procedures\u2014have come under attack in Congress and by international rights groups. Some have argued that the administration has emboldened Riyadh, giving it carte blanche to pursue its more assertive policies. New details pertaining to Khashoggi's murder have emerged, ostensibly tying the young Saudi monarch to the incident and leading to mounting congressional pressure. But the Trump administration has been willing to give the Saudis only a mere slap on the wrist without fundamentally altering the dynamics of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The Trump administration is unlikely to end its support for Saudi regional efforts or radically change its approach. But it could consider using its influence to encourage the Saudi leadership to moderate its assertive and damaging policies abroad. Rather than providing its assistance freely to Saudi Arabia, Washington could utilize it to extract concessions from the Saudi leadership to alter its behavior. Making U.S. support conditional to initiatives tied to Prince Mohammed's success provides Washington with a degree of sway over the brash monarch, who increasingly needs to produce a \u201cwin\u201d in light of the reputational harm the Khashoggi affair has done to the kingdom, his legacy and perhaps even his hold on power. This approach is not without risk\u2014the Saudi government could, for example, reduce intelligence sharing, or switch off the proverbial oil tap, like the OPEC states did in 1973. But 2018 is not 1973, and the United States is no longer as reliant on Saudi oil. More so, the Saudi government's assertive actions also pose operational and reputational risks to important U.S. interests, as the Khashoggi affair demonstrated, and therefore the benefits of this approach are likely to outweigh any costs Riyadh may seek to impose. On the surface, making U.S. support provisory may appear to be an unpalatable approach, one that legitimizes the crown prince. But wielded correctly, the White House can use this leverage to recalibrate the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Blanket support need not be granted in a way that emboldens Saudi behavior, leading to actions that are damaging to U.S. interests. Instead, the administration could consider also making conditional its support for the Saudi government's priority programs with the goal of altering and shaping its behavior. This includes making the Saudis take responsibility for Khashoggi's brutal death, putting an end to indiscriminate targeting practices in Yemen, altering the government's harsh response to opposition inside and outside of the Kingdom, and ending the rift with Qatar. Naysayers of such an approach might claim that it only deepens the transactionalism on which the U.S.-Saudi relationship is presently based. But it is worth recognizing that the partnership was founded on an explicit alignment of interests, not values. By acknowledging this, the United States would be better positioned to adopt an approach that best serves its own interests.

These revolutions are portrayed in the western media as popular democratic revolutions, in which the people of these respective nations demand democratic accountability and governance from their despotic leaders and archaic political systems.

It just so happens that \u201ctheir\u201d candidate is always the Western US-favoured candidate, whose campaign is often heavily financed by Washington; and who proposes US-friendly policies and neoliberal economic conditions. In the end, it is the people who lose out, as their genuine hope for change and accountability is denied by the influence the US wields over their political leaders. The soft revolutions also have the effect of antagonizing China and Russia, specifically, as it places US protectorates on their borders, and drives many of the former Warsaw Pact nations to seek closer political, economic and military cooperation.

Quite a few scholars and political leaders have found striking similarities between what took place in Europe before the First World War and what we are now witnessing in Asia. The current security situation in the Asia-Pacific -- with competing sovereignty claims, the rise of nationalism among both major and lesser countries, and great power rivalry -- increasingly resembles Europe a century ago. A world war is a very special kind of military conflict -- one which features a clash of two mighty coalitions led by great powers and possessing roughly comparable strategic resources, so that one side will not easily and swiftly prevail over the other. Are we going to see this sort of war breaking out in the Asia-Pacific? China is, of course, the rising power whose growing ambitions put it straight on a collision course with the incumbent hegemon -- the United States -- much like Anglo-German antagonism set the stage for the First World War. However, even if China becomes, as widely predicted, the No 1 economy and manages to close the military gap with the U.S., this will not be nearly enough to mount a viable challenge to U.S. hegemony. For China would have to confront not the U.S. alone but the U.S.-led bloc, counting, among others, Japan, Canada, Australia, and perhaps India. Beijing currently has just one formal ally -- North Korea, while Pakistan can be viewed as something of a de facto ally, at least vis-\u00e0-vis India. Although valuable to China, these countries can hardly be regarded as huge strategic assets. China lacks a dependable ally of a truly great power standing. The only plausible candidate is Russia. An alliance with Moscow would no doubt embolden Beijing. With Moscow as a close friend, China could be confident about the security of its northern borders and could count on unimpeded access to Russia's natural resources. Thus, Beijing would be much less vulnerable to naval blockades that the U.S. and its maritime allies would be sure to use in case of a serious confrontation. Should they form an entente, Moscow and Beijing could have Central Asia, as well as Mongolia, to themselves, effectively shutting out all external powers from the heart of Eurasia. An alliance with Moscow would also put Russia's military-industrial complex and its vast military infrastructure in Eurasia at Beijing's service. What might ultimately emerge is a Eurasian league, which, in controlling the continental heartland, would be reminiscent of the Central Powers alliance formed in the middle of Europe by Imperial Germany and the Habsburg empire. There is a strong tendency in the West to underestimate the potential for a Russia-China entente. A Sino-Russian strategic partnership is often portrayed as an \"axis of convenience\" founded on a shaky basis. Moscow, the argument goes, will be loath to form an alliance with Beijing because it distrusts and fears a rising China. The main problem with such thinking is that the U.S.-led West is seen by Moscow as a much bigger threat than China.

", "body": ["Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to power in Russia in 2012 signified a dramatic change in the country\u2019s foreign policy and military strategy. Scrapping the achievements of the Dmitry Medvedev era in the Kremlin, which was characterized by a thaw in relations with the West, Vladimir Putin opted for a more aggressive approach toward positioning the country in the international arena. Experts still argue what prompted this review of the country\u2019s foreign policy strategy, but the developments that likely had a major impact on Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy planning in 2012 included the war with Georgia in 2008, the Arab Spring protests, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) infamous military campaign in Libya, which brought down Russia\u2019s long-time ally Muammar Qaddafi. Contours of the new policy approach to the region started to emerge when Russia updated two of its key documents, the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation and the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.[i] The documents pronounced strategies based on protecting Russian national interests abroad, including militarily if need be, and increasing Moscow\u2019s role in maintaining global security. Quite notably, a more recent edition of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, signed by President Putin in November 2016, has a specific focus on the Middle East and names foreign meddling there as one of the causes of instability and extremism in the region that directly affect Russia.[ii] The statement that serves as de facto justification for the Russian military campaign in Syria became the first official document to elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East and North Africa. In the three years that divide the two concepts, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to foreign policy experienced an evolution and increasing securitization (the word \u201cterrorism\u201d figures 15 times in the 2013 Concept and 35 in its 2016 edition). The Foreign Policy Concept also spells out the Russian president\u2019s growing ambition to deal with instability where it originates before it reaches Russian borders. The rationale behind Russia\u2019s re-emergence as one of the leading powers in the Middle East was of a defensive nature and largely reactionary. The Arab Spring movement in the region was a painful reminder of the Color Revolutions that broke out across several post-Soviet states in the first half of the 2000s and, according to the Kremlin, led to the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself is of the belief that that the Arab Spring is a continuation of those Color Revolutions and that both are foreign-instigated.[iii] Coupled with a forced revolution in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi in what Russia declared was a violation of international law, this episode is often cited as a watershed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking.[iv] A wave of revolutions across Eurasia convinced the Russian leadership that the apparent domino effect of regime change would eventually target Russia. It is not a coincidence that the Russian president likens Color Revolutions and the Arab Spring protests to each other and often makes no distinction between them. Commenting on anti-corruption protests in Russia in March 2017, he went as far as to call them \u201can instrument of the Arab Spring.\u201d[v] Vladimir Putin sees Russia as a legitimate actor in designing a new power balance in the Middle East and as its integral part since security challenges originating in the region reverberate across the former Soviet space as well as in Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is an outsider in this region in the view of Russian officials. Criticism of the White House over its \u201cdestructive\u201d role in the Middle East is a central theme of many of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speeches, including the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly prior to launching his military campaign in Syria in September 2015. In those remarks, the Russian president accused the United States of being the source of problems in the Middle East.[vi] A gradual withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East under Barack Obama among other things meant that the region\u2019s \u201cpoliceman\u201d was no longer interested in maintaining order there, which arguably presented Moscow with numerous security challenges. Russia\u2019s re-emergence in the Middle East to a large extent happened to fill some of the void left by the retreating Obama administration. In some cases it happened effortlessly, such as in Egypt, where the US decision to cut aid to Cairo in 2013 led to the emergence of a budding Russia-Egypt alliance. In other contexts, most prominently in Syria, Russia had to invest significant diplomatic and military resources to marginalize the US in the war and in the peace process. What started out as an attempt to replace the United States where it was no longer interested in playing a leading role later transformed into an ambition to challenge the US even where it had no intention of retreating, for instance in the Gulf region. Russia\u2019s return to the Middle East differs from the Soviet experience: Today, Moscow is extending its reach without the baggage of Soviet ideology. The idea of using its arms exports to the Middle East in the ideological struggle against the West evaporated as soon as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) disintegrated and was replaced with the idea of making a profit for the cash-strapped budget. The Kremlin is looking to support its geopolitical claims with a strong pragmatic dimension. In the Middle East, Moscow to reinforce its influence there as well as offset the burden upon the Russian federal budget associated with the expenses of the Syrian campaign. Following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, Russia has used arms deals to reach out to Cold War\u2013era allies in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance. During the Cold War, Wynfred Joshua and Stephen P. Gilbert wrote that as more countries became recipients of Soviet military aid programs, there was a tendency for these countries to become greater political allies of the Soviet Union.[vii] And it seems that this argument is increasingly relevant today. According to SIPRI, in 2015 $5.5 billion in Russian arms exports were destined for clients in the Middle East, which was ten times more than all Russian experts to the region for all of the 1990s.[viii] With Vladimir Putin declaring victory over the Islamic State during his December 2017 visit to Syria, Russia is faced with a number of opportunities as well as challenges. Its military operation in Syria may have put Russia back on the radar in the Middle East; but in all certainty, it essentially solidified its position in the region. As Vladimir Putin is eyeing re-election as president in March 2018, foreign policy achievements, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, figure prominently in his election campaign rhetoric. One of the effects of Russia\u2019s assertive foreign policy has become an expectation from regional partners and opponents alike that Moscow will be active in the Middle East. However, the hard power that brought Russia to prominence in the region will not be a helpful tool to support long-term influence there and could, in fact, produce a negative impact for Russia\u2019s international standing. As a result, during his next term in office, Vladimir Putin will be faced with a challenge to depart from hard power, his preferred modus operandi, to embrace a spectrum of other tools in order to make Russia\u2019s presence in the region lasting and sustainable.", ""], "id": "654388f8b07fcbe0abc28eb2633f2e92909c615de84489db9cdec6a4c6c70c52", "highlighted_text": "Putin has a specific focus on the Middle East The statement elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East Putin sees Russia designing a new power balance in the Middle East gradual withdrawal of the United States Russia\u2019s re-emergence to fill the void Russia has used arms deals to Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria Moscow will be active in the Middle East", "highlights": [[2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 7105, 7145]], "underlines": [[2, 9, 132], [2, 1230, 1328], [2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1335, 1352], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1393, 1522], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1537, 1655], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 2915, 3064], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3391, 3415], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4091, 4092], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4133, 4347], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4370, 4415], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4424, 4431], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 4441, 4484], [2, 5580, 5639], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5832, 5867], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 5897, 5931], [2, 6975, 7104], [2, 7105, 7145]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [7, 9], [15, 21], [21, 22], [23, 27]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-08"}, {"tag": "That spreads authoritarianism and turns case", "cite": "Barmin 18 Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991). Such examples provide support that the United States rarely suspends military assistance in the face of its security imperatives.

The U.A.E.\u2019s leadership has also signaled its willingness, in principle, to accept a resolution to the country\u2019s civil war involving Bashar al-Assad, highlighting some distance between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh\u2019s positions. At the International Aviation and Space Salon in August 2015, held in Moscow one month before Russia launched its direct military intervention in Syria, Emirati and Russian officials coordinated meetings with their Egyptian and Jordanian counterparts to discuss regional security solutions. This year, with respect to Syria, Abu Dhabi certainly recognizes that the Kremlin is leading the negotiations while Moscow can open lines of communication between the Arab Gulf states and Tehran. In Egypt, the U.A.E. has joined Russia in backing President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s crackdown on Islamist groups. In Iraq, Abu Dhabi and Moscow have coordinated in the counterterrorism sphere by equipping Iraq\u2019s security forces in their fight against the Islamic State (ISIS). Libya is important for both countries, which are jointly concerned about the shattered country\u2019s future and are providing support to Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, who is aligned with the Egyptian-backed secular-learning government based in the eastern city of Tobruk, which rivals Libya\u2019s internationally-recognized Government of National Accord based in Tripoli. The U.A.E.\u2019s ambassador to Russia, Omar Ghobash, who deeply understands the Kremlin\u2019s interests, is a key player in this relationship. Ghobash has been vocal about the need for Russia\u2019s participation in settling regional issues and promoting stability. He often calls for Moscow\u2019s stepped up participation in confronting Middle Eastern security crises and promoting regional stability. Since 2008, Ghobash has been the vital interlocutor between Abu Dhabi and Moscow. U.A.E. investment in Russia has grown by $8 billion over the past few years, in no small part due to the ambassador\u2019s work. Russia sees Ghobash\u2019s ideas for fighting ISIS narratives as useful. He argues that combatting these extremists is a global responsibility and participation from all countries is necessary, particularly with regards to ideas, which resonates well with Russian scholars well-versed in Islam in Arab societies. Ghobash\u2019s view of Russia as a great Christian civilization fits Abu Dhabi\u2019s view of moderation, especially with the plight of ancient Christian minorities across the MENA region. His book, Letters to a Young Muslim, is generating considerable attention for boosting the fight against Islamist radicalization. The U.A.E. and Russia have also built a robust economic relationship. Russian exports to the Emirates are mainly commodities, such as precious metals and stones, steel, as well as ferrous metal products, machinery, equipment, vehicles, chemicals, food, wood, paper, and cardboard. Since the mid-2000s, Russian state-owned giants and private firms have done business in the Emirates and compete for some of the country\u2019s project tenders. For Russia, the U.A.E. represents an attractive business hub for Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Tourism has also strengthened bilateral relations with over 600,000 Russian tourists visiting the U.A.E. over the past two years. Meanwhile, the Gulf state has invested in Russia\u2019s gas, oil, real estate, infrastructure, and logistics sectors, and seeks to boost its presence in Russia\u2019s food production sector. Additionally, these two countries share natural resource extraction and are emerging trade centers in diamonds.

Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The war in Yemen is complex. Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah (\u201cSupporters of Allah\u201d) movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group. The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles. Ansar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border, launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sell on the black market. Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the  with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. Those who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy group, every day. Never mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it. The U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries. The Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies and hope for the best. Undermining the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement impossible. The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to fight this war with or without U.S. support.

Vowing to stand with U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, Trump cited lucrative foreign military sales and Iranian aggression among the reasons for his support. Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen has been met with a similar absence of criticism from the administration. However, the United States should do more than wring its hands about this war that has killed thousands and brought many more to the brink of starvation, by applying pressure on Saudi Arabia to change its course. The question is how? Walking away from supporting the Saudi-led war in Yemen and ending U.S. mid-air refueling might give Washington the moral high ground, but it will do little to stop the killing. The Saudis view the threat in Yemen as crucial to their interests, so U.S. pressure to end the war altogether will fall short of causing real change. To the Saudis, the threat of Iran establishing a foothold on their southern border is much more vital to their interests than procuring U.S. weapons. Rather than walk away from Yemen, they will buy Russian bombs or use less sophisticated weapons and tactics that will kill even more civilians. Americans will have washed our hands of a morally unacceptable situation, but civilian deaths and the threat of famine will actually get worse, and the world will look on and do nothing. The only approach worse than walking away is what the United States is currently doing\u2014giving the Saudis a blank check. Supporting the Saudis with intelligence, refueling, weaponry and minimal guidance on protecting civilians has failed at preventing civilian casualties. This policy was started by the Obama administration and put on steroids in the age of Trump. The theory was that by remaining engaged and involved, the United States could exercise some influence on Saudi Arabia and drive more responsible targeting and decision-making in Riyadh. It has not worked out this way. The Saudis continue to conduct the Yemeni war with insufficient regard for civilian lives and are contributing to a worsening humanitarian crisis. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no end to the war in sight. The U.S. administration had made clear there will be no consequences for this behavior when in September it certified to Congress that Saudis are doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties, despite obvious evidence to the contrary. Moreover, that certification was done despite objections from most of the State Department officials involved in the policy. Trump\u2019s full support of Saudi Arabia even after the Khashoggi murder highlights why America has been stuck with these terrible policy options in Yemen and why have Washington continued to support this quagmire. American support has not only led to a human catastrophe but also has done nothing to advance U.S. interests. The view inside the U.S. government has been that Saudi Arabia is too important to alienate and the United States does not have the leverage to change its behavior. Saudi Arabia is the largest global producer of oil in the world after the United States, a major investor in the U.S. economy, a purchaser of billions of dollars of weapons, and one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East\u2014a region where all of America\u2019s friends are imperfect. The Saudis know that even if Washington threatened and tried to convince them otherwise, America is unlikely to walk away from them over Yemen. But even if President Trump is unwilling to put additional pressure on the Kingdom, Saudi Arabia is still facing the real possibility that domestic political pressure in the West will lead other governments to walk away from them. Also, international businesses may curb their investments, and in the U.S. Congress\u2014many members of which disagree with Trump\u2019s support of Saudi Arabia\u2014could put harsh new restrictions on the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Moreover, many inside the Saudi royal family have balked at MBS\u2019s governing approach and may try to use this moment to sideline him, putting additional pressure on him to find a way out of the current diplomatic crisis that he and the people around him have created. The United States should use this moment to offer Saudi Arabia a take-it-or-leave-it deal that they may conceivably accept. Rather than suddenly withdrawing U.S. support for the conflict in Yemen, Washington should offer to remain in or even become more engaged but only if the Saudis change their approach entirely and bring the United States into the decisionmaking process. This starts with the Saudis sharing their strategic plans with the United States and taking on board American recommendations for how to shift to a strategy that is more viable and less dependent on airstrikes that harm civilians. Saudi Arabia must also mitigate some of the worst humanitarian impacts. Under closer guidance, the air war will be carried out similarly to how the United States conducted the air war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. American military personnel will have a seat at the table with their Saudi partners and an ability to veto strikes based on humanitarian or civilian casualty concerns. In exchange for being made a greater stakeholder, the United States will provide more support and get more engaged. This could potentially even include conducting certain air strikes and putting a limited number of military advisors on the ground. This will further ensure the Saudis meet a much higher standard when it comes to the laws of war. This approach is not without its tradeoffs. It comes with the real risk of further entangling America in the conflict in Yemen. Washington also has to accept the reality that the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria caused significant civilian casualties, and the United States will be blamed for similar casualties in Yemen. However, the approach we recommend and the one the United States has pursued elsewhere is more effective and humane than what the Saudis are doing in Yemen. American involvement could make a meaningful difference. Americans should also have realistic expectations. The Saudis are likely not to take Washington up on this offer, in which case the United States should suspend military aid and distance itself from the war in Yemen until the Saudis change their minds or take clear steps to end the war. But given the scrutiny they are under, the likelihood of a more flexible approach from the Crown Prince is much higher than it was two months ago. Even if Saudi Arabia is a key ally in the Middle East, the United States should not give it a blank check of support.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991).

Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The war in Yemen is complex. Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah (\u201cSupporters of Allah\u201d) movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group. The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles. Ansar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border, launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sell on the black market. Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the  with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.

Those who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy group, every day. Never mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it. The U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries.

We have few good options, but giving in to that temptation would be the worst thing to do. Everyone involved in this scandal has performed poorly, if not disgracefully. Saudi Arabia has been caught lying about Khashoggi\u2019s death. President Donald Trump has sided both with and against the Saudis, thereby earning brickbats from all sides. Turkey pretends to care about Khashoggi but imprisons more journalists than any other nation. And then there is Khashoggi himself. It\u2019s awkward to speak ill of the dead, but Khashoggi\u2019s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood was not a mere youthful flirtation. Just a year ago, he called on the Saudi leadership to cooperate with them, and to lead a unified Arab world to support the Palestinians in their fight against Israel. That doesn\u2019t justify killing him. Of the region\u2019s four major Muslim powers, Turkey has slid away from the West, Egypt just signed a strategic partnership with Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has hated the United States since 1979. That leaves only Saudi Arabia as a possible U.S. ally. Which is why Khashoggi\u2019s death has caused such a stir. Revealingly, at about the same time as the writer disappeared, France disrupted an Iranian bomb plot that would have killed tens, if not hundreds, of people in Paris. And yet it\u2019s Khashoggi\u2019s killing that has grabbed the headlines. That\u2019s because Khashoggi isn\u2019t just a victim; he\u2019s a proxy for a debate about U.S. policy. Obama-era veterans from Ben Rhodes to Michael McFaul have argued that Khashoggi\u2019s death proves that President Barack Obama\u2019s desire to sidle up to Iran at the expense of the Saudis was correct. This is nonsense. Obama\u2019s policy isn\u2019t the answer, it\u2019s a significant part of the problem. As I have written in this column before, most U.S. alliances are as much about restraining our allies as they are about deterring our enemies. When Obama tilted toward Tehran, he gave Saudi Arabia a reason to start writing its own insurance policy against Iran, its regional enemy. Predictably, the Saudis have made a mess of it. They wanted to secure their flanks, but their war in Yemen is endless and profitless, and their blockade of Qatar, though driven by understandable concern over Iranian influence, has achieved little. At home, the regime\u2019s so-called drive against corruption \u2014 like the parallel ones in Russia and China \u2014 is about centralizing power by eliminating opponents. The killing of Khashoggi, whether it was deliberate or a panicked bungle, is part of that drive \u2014 and it has backfired spectacularly. The problem for the United States is that Saudi behavior is destructive. But leaving the Saudis to go it alone would merely be more of the same policy that got us where we are today. Since 2011, when most U.S. forces left Iraq, declining U.S. influence has paralleled rising regional violence \u2014 and Iranian power. That violence isn\u2019t our fault \u2014 but given how rotten the regimes in the region are, we shouldn\u2019t have expected them to behave any better. Kicking Saudi Arabia to the curb now is tempting, but it will only quicken the descent by making it clear to the Saudis that they\u2019re on their own against the Iranians. Breaking this spiral won\u2019t be easy. It may not be possible. Yet we have to try to convince the Saudis that their actions, far from enhancing their security, are undermining it. Ironically, Khashoggi was right about that; the reaction to his death is proof of it. Our response to it should be guided not by self-righteous outrage, but by our interest in talking the Saudis down from their ledge.", ""], "id": "8d5259c0e3ffe1340beb23f3a67ef0aafccdefd86fe3996a8c22879b0e44954f", "highlighted_text": "Of the region\u2019s four major leaves only Saudi Arabia as a possible U.S. Obama\u2019s desire to sidle up to Iran at the expense of the Saudis was nonsense When Obama tilted toward Tehran, he gave Saudi Arabia a reason to start writing its own insurance policy against Iran the Saudis have made a mess Saudi behavior is destructive leaving the Saudis to go it alone would be more of the same policy that got us where we are today declining U.S. influence has paralleled rising regional violence and Iranian power Kicking Saudi Arabia to the curb quicken the descent by making it clear to the Saudis that they\u2019re on their own against the Iranians .", "highlights": [[2, 971, 977], [2, 978, 997], [2, 1182, 1188], [2, 1189, 1206], [2, 1207, 1225], [2, 1727, 1794], [2, 1812, 1820], [2, 2038, 2109], [2, 2110, 2142], [2, 2143, 2155], [2, 2190, 2217], [2, 2759, 2788], [2, 2794, 2833], [2, 2841, 2898], [2, 2945, 3009], [2, 3012, 3029], [2, 3169, 3201], [2, 3236, 3335], [2, 3335, 3336]], "underlines": [[2, 19, 28], [2, 58, 86], [2, 116, 167], [2, 971, 977], [2, 978, 997], [2, 998, 1107], [2, 1132, 1152], [2, 1158, 1159], [2, 1165, 1175], [2, 1177, 1181], [2, 1182, 1188], [2, 1189, 1206], [2, 1207, 1225], [2, 1226, 1230], [2, 1300, 1410], [2, 1424, 1432], [2, 1534, 1608], [2, 1610, 1628], [2, 1668, 1726], [2, 1727, 1794], [2, 1795, 1803], [2, 1812, 1820], [2, 1820, 1821], [2, 1822, 1893], [2, 1936, 1973], [2, 1974, 1996], [2, 1997, 2036], [2, 2038, 2109], [2, 2110, 2142], [2, 2143, 2155], [2, 2155, 2175], [2, 2177, 2189], [2, 2190, 2217], [2, 2759, 2788], [2, 2794, 2833], [2, 2841, 2898], [2, 2898, 2899], [2, 2900, 2910], [2, 2943, 2944], [2, 2945, 3009], [2, 3012, 3029], [2, 3031, 3060], [2, 3063, 3168], [2, 3169, 3201], [2, 3236, 3335], [2, 3401, 3509]], "emphasis": [[2, 116, 167], [2, 1189, 1206], [2, 1812, 1820], [2, 1820, 1821], [2, 1974, 1996], [2, 2110, 2142], [2, 2794, 2833], [2, 2841, 2898], [2, 2898, 2899], [2, 2943, 2944], [2, 2945, 3009], [2, 3236, 3335]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-10-21"}, {"tag": "Cutting aid to Saudi Arabia prevents the United States from checking Iran, increases violence in Yemen and opens the door to more Saudi abuses \u2013 turns case", "cite": "Cordesman 18  Anthony H.

Saudi Arabia is a critical American security partner in the Middle East BY ANTHONY CORDESMAN, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR \u2014 03/21/18 02:00 PM EDT https://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east", "body": ["Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that our strategy in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important single security partner. Israel\u2019s security is certainly a key American concern, but it does not play an active role in most of America\u2019s ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS and Al Qaeda. Saudi Arabia\u2019s role as a strategic partner has also been enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their own internal stability and their roles in the region have sharply diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major instability problems and are at war. Our European allies have declining power projection capabilities, and Turkey\u2019s role in the region is increasingly problematic. It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs the United States as much or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi military forces are steadily improving, but it is the U.S. presence in the region that create a balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and exercises also play a critical role in improving Saudi forces. But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia is now the most critical single security partner in ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf region. While the United States is largely eliminating its need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily increasing its dependence on the health and growth of the global economy and imports from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is that U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to increase in spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports. This is why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s visit to the White House. Saudi Arabia\u2019s reform and economic development plans are critical to its stability and the region\u2019s security. The kingdom needs U.S. encouragement and an understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot implement these plans effectively without outside support. The burden sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a source of ready money every time the United States has a need. It is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on security, which is three times the economic burden security places on the United States. This spending is too high given the kingdom\u2019s other needs, and the United States should be focusing on better ways to make its security partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and Jordan more efficient and less costly, not simply on spending more. At the same time, Iran is all too real a threat. Effective joint action in dealing with Iran\u2019s nuclear programs, its ballistic and cruise missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf shipping, and expending military influence in the region are all critical common U.S. and Saudi priorities. The United States also badly needs to find some common approach to dealing with Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and lasting stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as possible, and help stabilize relations with Turkey. There are no easy options in either case, but Saudi Arabia is the key potential Arab partner any such efforts. The United States, especially members of Congress, needs to remember that we have had at least as many military problems in fighting the Iraq and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have faced in fighting in Yemen. Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do little more that lead the Saudis to ignore the systems that the United States has helped set up to limit targeting of civilians and using unguided and more damaging air munitions. It raises a whole new round of questions about the U.S commitment to its partners in the region. We need to forge a common solution in Yemen, not a decoupling that leaves Saudi Arabia exposed. This would fail in both military and human rights terms, and leaves both the United States and Saudi Arabia with no options for dealing with the Houthi or Iran, seeking ways to end the war, dealing with Al Qaida or the other terrorist movements in Yemen, and without any means to help Yemen back to some form of stability and development. These challenges are also are reasons why the United States should do as much as possible to persuade Mohammed Bin Salman to end the divisions that have led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to split with Qatar, and to rising tensions with Oman. More unity between the southern Gulf states in dealing with Iran and terrorism can do far more to help the United states than more arms sales. Finally, more interoperability, common facilities and cooperation are key to countering Iran. We need to take this visit seriously, and stop focusing on pomp and deals. The United States is highly unlikely to find a better Saudi leader for reform and change in Saudi Arabia during the next decade, or one more committed to improving Saudi security in ways that serve the common interests of both the United States and Saudi Arabia.", ""], "id": "c230f2e052a7dd1bd938dd1edfb986112becb77eb0f0a216935aa64f14cd355c", "highlighted_text": "our strategy in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia Egypt and Algeria are focused on internal stability Iraq and Syria are at war U.S. arms shipments play a critical role in improving Saudi forces ignoring the role Saudi Arabia has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to check Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States should deal with M B S Iran is a threat. joint action in dealing with Iran\u2019s nuclear programs ballistic and cruise missile programs are common priorities.

Mohammed bin Salman is still the head of Saudi\u2019s Ministry of Defense, which gives him control of the state\u2019s military apparatus and aspects of its foreign policy, while also effectively leading the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG), which is an internal military force dedicated solely to protecting the royal family from coup attempts. Karasik also noted that MbS still has strong support from the country\u2019s technocrats, who back MbS\u2019 reform efforts. These positions, and not his presence at diplomatic meetings, are likely to be more accurate measurements of MbS\u2019 political power inside Saudi Arabia. \u201cMbS doesn't disappear if you keep track of the Arabic press. Ever since MBS became Deputy Crown Prince there has been a steady stream of Western reporting on major internal problems and Disappearing Acts as a sign of problems at the top of the Saudi hierarchy,\u201d Karasik added. Domestically, according to Karasik, MbS still appears to be a popular figure among those who support his plan to open the country up to foreign investment while leashing the country\u2019s notorious religious police. For his lack of high-profile public appearances, Saudi may simply be making a strategic calculation to limit his exposure. \u201cI don't think anyone can say anything with certainty but it may be that Mohammed bin Salman is keeping a lower public profile as he continues to consolidate power domestically and attempts to contain the fallout from the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d explained Kristian Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at the Baker Institute based out of Rice University. On a supposed internal rift between the king and MbS, Ulrichsen points out several occasions where MbS and the king have been seen together: \u201cI think it is safe to assume that Mohammed bin Salman retains the support of King Salman,\u201d he said. When it comes to anonymous sources with purported insider knowledge claiming MbS is on his way out or that the royal court is scheduling is replacement, there is reason to be skeptical. \u201cIf anyone is leaking information about the Crown Prince's position I would imagine it might be coming from members of Western intelligence communities who are alarmed at the volatility and unpredictability in aspects of Saudi regional and foreign policymaking,\u201d Ulrichsen argued, though Al Bawaba could not independently verify this claim. Karasik further explained that the anonymous leaks may be politically driven attempts to try and influence who becomes the next king. The country\u2019s current ruler, King Salman, has suffered from dementia for years and is likely to pass the reigns of the country on soon. \u201cSome sources want MbS out so bad that they will manipulate the press and leak articles almost to the minute in order to keep fake narratives alive,\u201d Karasik added. A protester wears a mask depicting MbS\u2019 face while demonstrating outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey (AFP/FILE) Understanding how Mohammed bin Salman is able to hold onto power in spite of global backlash is just as important to knowing how he abuses that power in the first place. That he ordered the hit on a famous American journalist speaks to one level of power he commands: to know how he can order such hits with impunity is similarly vital information, which speaks to another type of power he has captured. There is a real risk this information could get lost under the stampede of recurrent speculations by some media outlets regarding his supposedly ailing grasp on Saudi. Thinking he is vulnerable from the negative media coverage betrays the amount of power he actually has. As it appears now, he is withstanding the negative media coverage of his rule while he continues the Saudi\u2019s war in Yemen that he ordered in 2015 and tortures more dissidents and women\u2019s activists. The rumors that the royal court is grooming a replacement have so far not panned out. The underlying reason why he is able to persist as the country\u2019s de facto leader is because he has centralized power more effectively than any other Saudi leader: he has personalized the state\u2019s institutions around him while becoming the face of a fast-changing kingdom, all the while brutalizing those who stand in his way and exacerbating the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

Chris Murphy went further. Trump officials, he warned, \u201cmust quickly reorient their policy toward Saudi Arabia or Congress will do it for them.\u201d There is no question that Khashoggi\u2019s killing was a crime perpetrated by agents of the Saudi government. But the idea that the United States can magically disentangle Saudi Arabia from its crown prince is fanciful. If Mohammed bin Salman stays, Washington will not be able to sideline him without harming its own vital interests. First, King Salman took a huge step in appointing Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince in 2017. He promoted his son not just over many other candidates in the second and third generation of the Saud family but also over three of his older brothers, all of whom have impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. The king, an astute practitioner of royal politics since the early 1950s, would not have come to this decision lightly. All previous successions had followed a clear pattern of age and seniority among the sons of the founder. Having taken the momentous step of overturning that order, it would be inconceivable for the king to change his mind. Doing so would reopen the Pandora\u2019s box of intergenerational succession, which would destabilize the entire monarchy. Second, Mohammed bin Salman has proved a quick study of power politics himself. Since his appointment as crown prince, he has moved swiftly to consolidate power by bringing the most important internal security organs, including the domestic intelligence service and elite special forces, under his direct control. In the past, these bodies had been parceled out among several royal figures. Mohammed bin Salman also installed a loyalist as the head of the national guard and recently appointed his brother as vice minister of defense, which gives him effective control of all the kingdom\u2019s security institutions. Meanwhile, he has replaced many key royal governors with close allies. His control over so much of the Saudi state means that it would be virtually impossible for any faction within the royal family to organize against him, even if the United States did threaten to cut ties. Moreover, during times of crisis, the royal family has consistently rallied to\u2014not against\u2014the throne. Given that Saudi Arabia is an important ally of the United States, shunning Mohammed bin Salman won\u2019t likely serve U.S. interests. The crown prince\u2019s succession is thus virtually assured; his future and the future of Saudi Arabia are indissolubly intertwined. Given that Saudi Arabia is an important ally of the United States in terms of regulating global energy markets, security cooperation, and pushing back against Iranian expansionism, shunning Mohammed bin Salman won\u2019t likely serve U.S. interests. After all, for all the talk of the crown prince\u2019s brashness (former State Department officials Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky described the crown prince as a \u201cruthless, reckless, and impulsive leader\u201d), some of the changes he has brought to his country have benefitted the United States. Not least among them are his efforts to drastically curtail Wahhabi clerical influence at home by detaining dozens of radical clerics and drastically limiting the power of the religious police and to empower Saudi women by better integrating them into the workforce.", ""], "id": "3bd651a294ce46fac7eb296b2395054cb9fa8f74b5d8bc033c95252f8acaf19e", "highlighted_text": "It is entirely possible to sanction and shun the Saudi leader while still doing business with his regime \u201c[t]he Saudi royal family cannot afford a rupture with the U S the idea that the U S can magically disentangle Saudi from its crown prince is fanciful Washington will not be able to sideline him without harming its own vital interests All previous successions had followed a clear pattern of seniority it would be inconceivable for the king to change his mind Doing so would reopen the Pandora\u2019s box of succession, which would destabilize the monarchy. he has moved swiftly to consolidate power it would be virtually impossible for any faction to organize against him, even if the U S did threaten to cut ties during times of crisis, the family has rallied to the throne. shunning M b S won\u2019t serve U.S. interests", "highlights": [[2, 624, 647], [2, 668, 670], [2, 671, 748], [2, 776, 815], [2, 835, 855], [2, 861, 862], [2, 1134, 1153], [2, 1159, 1160], [2, 1166, 1197], [2, 1205, 1238], [2, 1270, 1353], [2, 1760, 1816], [2, 1825, 1834], [2, 1925, 1982], [2, 1984, 2026], [2, 2045, 2084], [2, 2092, 2101], [2, 2221, 2262], [2, 2841, 2889], [2, 2914, 2952], [2, 2958, 2959], [2, 2965, 2989], [2, 3001, 3028], [2, 3035, 3045], [2, 3059, 3069], [2, 3082, 3093], [2, 3161, 3171], [2, 3179, 3180], [2, 3183, 3184], [2, 3190, 3195], [2, 3203, 3223]], "underlines": [[2, 624, 647], [2, 668, 670], [2, 671, 748], [2, 776, 815], [2, 835, 855], [2, 861, 862], [2, 1134, 1153], [2, 1159, 1160], [2, 1166, 1197], [2, 1205, 1238], [2, 1270, 1353], [2, 1760, 1816], [2, 1825, 1834], [2, 1925, 1982], [2, 1984, 2026], [2, 2045, 2084], [2, 2092, 2101], [2, 2221, 2262], [2, 2841, 2889], [2, 2914, 2952], [2, 2958, 2959], [2, 2965, 2989], [2, 3001, 3028], [2, 3035, 3045], [2, 3059, 3069], [2, 3082, 3093], [2, 3161, 3171], [2, 3179, 3180], [2, 3183, 3184], [2, 3190, 3195], [2, 3203, 3223]], "emphasis": [[2, 624, 647], [2, 668, 670], [2, 671, 748], [2, 776, 815], [2, 835, 855], [2, 861, 862], [2, 1134, 1153], [2, 1159, 1160], [2, 1166, 1197], [2, 1205, 1238], [2, 1270, 1353], [2, 1760, 1816], [2, 1825, 1834], [2, 1925, 1982], [2, 1984, 2026], [2, 2045, 2084], [2, 2092, 2101], [2, 2221, 2262], [2, 2841, 2889], [2, 2914, 2952], [2, 2958, 2959], [2, 2965, 2989], [2, 3001, 3028], [2, 3035, 3045], [2, 3059, 3069], [2, 3082, 3093], [2, 3161, 3171], [2, 3179, 3180], [2, 3183, 3184], [2, 3190, 3195], [2, 3203, 3223]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-10-24"}, {"tag": "Saudi isn\u2019t the internal link to the US striking Iran\u2013 the NSC is filled with hawks", "cite": "Ward 19 Alex Ward, Staff writer covering international security and defense issues, as well as a co-host of Vox's \"Worldly\" podcast.

On September 6, Iranian-backed militants in Iraq shot three mortars into Baghdad\u2019s massive diplomatic compound, which is home to the US Embassy. Two days later, rockets shot by unknown attackers streaked toward the US consulate in Basra during anti-Iran protests in the city. Those strikes, which injured no one, led Bolton to have the National Security Council (NSC) ask the Defense Department for military plans to attack Iran, according to US officials and people familiar with the request \u2014 although it\u2019s unclear how close the US came to bombing the country. The sequence of events, which the Wall Street Journal first reported over the weekend, shows how seriously the Trump administration has considered escalating its policy toward Iran. Yet multiple US officials, including NSC spokesperson Garrett Marquis, told me Bolton\u2019s request was merely meant to ensure the president had all options presented to him \u2014 a key part of his job. \u201cThe NSC coordinates policy and provides the President with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats,\u201d Marquis said in an email. Still, the request caused some controversy in the Pentagon. Then-Defense Secretary James Mattis didn\u2019t even want to respond to the attacks with a strongly worded statement (let alone a military strike), alarming US officials across the government, a senior administration official told me. The White House eventually did issue a statement on September 11 declaring that \u201cthe United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States Government facilities.\u201d And Mattis had \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about Bolton\u2019s strike request, one US official told Axios on Sunday. The Pentagon eventually provided some military options to the White House \u2014 such as a strike on an Iranian military facility \u2014 but Mattis and other officials rejected the idea of a large-scale retaliatory attack. Mattis declined to comment for this article. Some US officials say Bolton\u2019s request is another example of his long-held animus toward Tehran. Both in and out of government, the top Trump aide has made clear his desire to see the current Iranian regime fall. But one person familiar with how the NSC operates told me that Bolton is using the council to bend US foreign policy to his will \u2014 and especially toward a much harder stance against Iran \u2014 all under President Trump\u2019s nose. \u201cThey do what they want,\u201d this person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said. \u201cIn any other administration they would be fired.\u201d That\u2019s troubling. While Bolton in this case may have just been doing his job, it still brings up the question about just how much he\u2019s using his power to pursue one his long-term objectives \u2014 regime change in Iran. How the Iran request came about The group Bolton leads \u2014 the National Security Council \u2014 coordinates national security policy across the sprawling US government. It collects input on major topics from the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and other agencies to provide the president with the best options at his disposal. On the Sunday after the attack on the Baghdad compound, the NSC\u2019s deputies committee, comprised mainly of No. 2s from the various bureaucracies, met to discuss those options. Mira Ricardel, then Bolton\u2019s deputy before a spat with first lady Melania Trump led to her ouster, at one point reportedly called the attacks \u201can act of war.\u201d What\u2019s unclear, though, is if the idea to strike Iran with force came from those meetings or if Bolton singlehandedly wanted the Pentagon to draw up some military options. Either way, one Pentagon official I spoke to didn\u2019t seem bothered by the ask. \u201cWe always have and discuss military options based on new circumstances,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe question of how close we were to striking \u2014 that no one knows.\u201d The White House, of course, agrees. \u201cThis incident showed the NSC process led by Bolton works,\u201d a senior administration official told me. Top Trump advisers \u2014 especially Bolton \u2014 are avid Iran hawks There are concerns that the NSC works in just the way Bolton wants it to \u2014 pursuing his own policy objectives, mainly an aggressive anti-Iran stance. Bolton has staffed up the NSC with people who share his views. Last week, he hired Richard Goldberg, a noted Iran hawk, to run the administration\u2019s pressure campaign against the country. He also added Charles Kupperman, a former Boeing executive and long-time confidante, to serve as his deputy. Together, they will help Bolton run America\u2019s foreign policy with little input from the president, some say.

This approach has deep roots in Wahhabi history. Mixed with Iran\u2019s expansive regional meddling, the combination is dangerous and explosive. Washington needs to exercise great care and not inflame the situation. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the kingdom\u2019s unique form of Islam, spent time in Basra in the middle of the 18th century. His exposure to Iraq\u2019s most Shiite city was formative to his ideas, according to Michael Crawford, the premier Western biographer of Wahhab. He became an extreme critic of Shiism, branding them polytheists and infidels. Saudi armies sacked Shiite cities in Iraq, destroyed Shiite shrines in Mecca and invaded Yemen to try to defeat its Zaydi Shiite tribes. Modern Saudi monarchs have had antagonistic relationships with Iran, both with the shah and the ayatollahs, but they have avoided direct confrontation and always kept communication channels open. King Faysal (who ruled from 1964-1975) detested the shah as an egomaniac, but worked with him to create the Organization of the Islamic Conference (now known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation). King Fahd (who ruled from 1982-2005) backed Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq War, but he used the Saudi power of the purse to force Saddam to accept a cease-fire to end the war. King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud (who ruled from 2005-2015) appointed a Saudi Shiite as ambassador to Tehran and kept open dialogue even as he sent troops across the King Fahd causeway to smash Shiite majority dissent in Bahrain seven years ago. The troops are still there. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have followed a much more confrontational approach. Their signature foreign policy initiative is the 3-year-old war in Yemen, which they portray as a necessary war to prevent the Iranians from taking over Yemen with the Zaydi Houthi rebels. The war has been marked by humanitarian disasters, like the bombing of a wedding party by the Saudi coalition April 22 and the mass starvation of the Yemeni people by the Saudi blockade. It is a sectarian conflict overplayed by a regional struggle for power by the Saudis and Iranians. The war costs the kingdom a fortune and the ayatollahs a pittance, but it\u2019s very popular with the Wahhabi establishment. At home, King Salman and Prince Mohammed have led a ruthless crackdown on Saudi Shiite dissidents in the Eastern Province of the kingdom. The city of Awamiyah has been pounded into rubble by the Saudi authorities. Satellite imagery shows whole neighborhoods destroyed. The execution of prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr led to the Saudis breaking of diplomatic relations with Iran. This, too, is popular with the Wahhabi clerical establishment. In Syria and Lebanon, the Saudis have sought to weaken the Bashar al-Assad regime and Hezbollah, but neither effort has worked. Iran is more firmly embedded in both states than ever before. The determination of the Donald Trump administration to pull America out of Syria has alarmed Riyadh. Its offer to send Saudi and other Arab troops, an old proposal repackaged, is hollow given the performance of Saudi ground forces in Yemen. Iraq is the exception that proves the rule. For a decade after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Saudi Arabia backed Sunni Arab resistance to the elected Shiite majority governments. The Wahhabi clerical establishment enthusiastically backed this approach, even as it benefited al-Qaeda in Iraq and ultimately the Islamic State. It was a bankrupt and counterproductive policy. It also became increasingly irrelevant, as the Sunni Arab community in Iraq lost its power and influence. So now the Saudis are trying to develop a positive relationship with Iraq\u2019s Shiites. The Saudis have belatedly opened an embassy in Baghdad, and they seek to open consulates in Basra and Najaf to add to one in Erbil. There is talk of the crown prince visiting Iraq. The border is opening up for trade; sporting events are underway. The Saudi policy initiative is a bright spot for Iraq and the kingdom. But there are still limits. Iraq is not a member of the Saudi-led Islamic Military Alliance, which is intended to confront Iran by the Saudis. The Iranians have many more assets in Iraq than the Saudis, and they are determined to maintain their hegemony. The Saudis have no counter to the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The optimal solution to de-escalate the sectarian conflict in the region is to start in Yemen. The existing United Nations process is a nonstarter because it is based on a UN Security Council resolution that is tilted deliberately toward Riyadh. Washington, London and Paris have tremendous influence as the suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia. They should work together to help find a face-saving way for the king and crown prince to end the war. It will take tough love. Iran is unlikely to help. The war in Yemen is a major strategic advantage for Tehran. It bogs the Saudis down at little cost to Iran. But it is also dangerous, especially now that the Iranians have helped the Houthis\u2019 missile capabilities. Riyadh is literally under fire. This is playing arsonist during a wildfire. The Iranians are particularly eager to humiliate Prince Mohammed, who has called Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a 21st-century Hitler. Iran calls the crown prince infantile. In this toxic environment, it makes no sense for the Trump administration to jettison the multinational nuclear agreement with Iran. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can be criticized for its shortcomings, but it is keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.

Without increased U.S. military aid, Egypt will be ill-equipped to counter the threat of IS, which will gain a crucial foothold that can expand into other parts of the Middle East. For its part, Egypt must integrate modern counter-terrorism techniques into its military doctrine. In the past year, IS has lost most of its territories in Iraq and Syria. But having established a powerful base in Egypt since 2013, IS shifted its attention from Iraq and Syria to Egypt. There has been a continuous Islamist insurgency in Northern Sinai led by more than 1,000 IS fighters. The Sinai insurgency has had drastic consequences: the take-down of a Russian passenger plane in 2015 that killed all 224 people on board; the attacks on the Multinational Force of Observers (MFO), including American personnel Task Force of Sinai; the killing of more than 250 people in the al-Rawda mosque bombing of November 2017, and the targeting of Egypt\u2019s Minister of Defense and Minister of Interior during their visit to al-Arish airport in December 2017. In February 2018, Egypt\u2019s military started Operation Sinai, involving land, naval and air forces, plus police and border guards, to target terrorist organizations in northern and southern Sinai. After two weeks of military operations, Mohamed Farid, chief of staff of the armed forces, asked President Sisi to extend the campaign by at least three months. Farid justified his request by noting the terrorist organizations\u2019 extensive possession of explosives and the hardships that Egypt\u2019s forces face in residential areas. In fact, the Egyptian Army has been incapable of countering IS expansion because it lacks advanced relevant training for its aircrews and enhanced ground forces training in urban combat. Current American aid to Egypt has strengthened Egypt\u2019s ability for conventional warfare, but has not enhanced the capabilities necessary to defeat IS in Sinai. The Egyptian army\u2019s failure underscores the need to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the $1.3 billion in annual U.S. military support. This aid started as compensation for Egypt\u2019s peace deal with Israel, by providing an alternative arms supplier to Cairo, and establishing a semi-military deterrence between Egypt and Israel. Today, however, the United States cannot and should not shoulder this responsibility alone. European nations, NATO, and Israel also have a vested interest in countering IS threats in this region, and should play an active role in increasing Egyptian counter-terrorism capability. To be sure, the United States finds it challenging to convince the Egyptian government to accept counter-terrorism training and its integration into its military doctrine. Nevertheless, the U.S. should reorient its military relations with Egypt and build more international support to counter the growing Islamist insurgency in Sinai. The U.S. should also persuade the European counterparts to conduct counter-insurgency training for the Egyptian ground and air forces. Egyptian-European military exercises are still limited to naval operations, which have historically played a role in Egypt\u2019s patrol of the southern Mediterranean Sea and the prevention of illegal immigration to Europe. In light of IS expansion into Northern Sinai, such naval cooperation is insufficient and broader cooperation is needed immediately. The Egyptian army has been skeptical of any pressure from the U.S. regarding Egypt\u2019s military operations. Egypt has always perceived U.S. military aid in its current form as compensation for the peace treaty with Israel, and would perceive any revision of U.S. military aid as an unfriendly act. But the current landscape offers the most opportune moment to restructure the Egyptian army for fighting the IS insurgency in Sinai, due to the Sisi regime\u2019s need for a quick win to reinvigorate its legitimacy among Egyptians. The U.S. can still pressure the Egyptian leadership to change its arm deals priorities to include the needed counter-terrorism tools.(Instead, to cite but two examples, Egypt has recently bought German submarines and two French amphibious helicopter landing vehicles last year, from national funds.)

The situation in Syria serves as a clear example of Russian meddling, but the actual challenge does not stop there. To take but one striking recent example: in December 2017, after signing the final contracts to establish the El Dabaa nuclear plant at a summit with the Egyptian president in Cairo, Putin stated that he was trying to create greater cooperation with Egypt and described the country as an old and reliable partner in the region. The relationship between Russia and Egypt revived after President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood regime in July 2013. Putin had viewed the Brotherhood regime with some suspicion and anxiety due to the Brotherhood\u2019s relations with Islamist groups in the northern Caucasus. However, while the Russian Supreme Court had included the Brotherhood on its terrorist list since 2006, this had not prevented Putin from searching for ways to cooperate with the Muslim Brotherhood in an attempt to resecure some role for Russia in Egypt. This was clearly demonstrated by Putin\u2019s support for Mohamed Morsi\u2019s role during the 2012 Gaza war, as well as by Putin's April 2013 reception of Morsi in Moscow. However, the situation has undoubtedly improved with Sisi\u2019s rise. In Sisi, Putin believes that he had found the right match for a military partnership. Sisi represents what Putin seeks in an ally: a military man who had risen up in politics and is trying to rule in difficult circumstances, in need of support and ready to offer concessions. Putin has not missed this opportunity to turn Egypt into a country revolving within the new Russian orbit. The most important aspects of this effort have been military, economic, and political. The Military Aspect: The overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood and the decline of democracy and human rights in Egypt created a sharp disagreement between the Sisi government and the former U.S. administration led by President Obama. As a result of this dispute, Washington suspended some military aid to Egypt and blocked delivery of military equipment and aircraft that had been in the United States for maintenance. In response, Russia immediately exploited this situation, sending both the foreign minister and defense minister to Cairo at the head of a high-level military delegation that also included the president of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation and the president of the Russian weapons export firm, Rosoboronexport. The delegation arrived ready to discuss a Russian arms deals for the Egyptian army, which depends in large part on American armaments. After this meeting, Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2014also the defense minister at the time\u2014and Egyptian foreign minister Nabil Fahmy traveled to Moscow to continue discussions with their Russian counterparts in what were known as the \"2+2\" meetings. The result was a Russian arms deal for Egypt with a value of more than three billion dollars, backed by Saudi and Emirati funding. Full deliveries, however, remain to be seen. It is worth noting that the Egyptian army currently obtains annual military aid from the United States of 1.3 billion dollars, in addition to economic aid, which totals hundreds of millions of dollars. Since this aid was first approved in the late 1970s, Egypt has obtained about 76 billion dollars from the United States. Within the military context, Russian and Egyptian forces carried out military exercises known as \u201cProtectors of Friendship\u201d in September 2017. Earlier the same year, some Russian special forces were deployed at a military base in the western region adjacent to the Libyan border in order to carry out operations and offer assistance to Khalifa Haftar\u2019s Libyan militias, which enjoy both Egyptian and Russian backing. Recently, the two sides agreed to prepare a cooperation document allowing Russia to use Egyptian skies and military bases for military operations. This level of military cooperation between the two sides was unprecedented in recent decades. The current situation almost calls to mind the cooperation that existed between Egypt and the Soviet Union in the 1960s before President Sadat expelled his Russian advisers in the summer of 1972.

Russia\u2019s arms sales to Iran \u2014 and US pursuit of the nuclear agreement \u2014 similarly take on additional flavor. Over time, this dynamic could increasingly lead Washington to lobby its partners in the Middle East to choose sides by limiting their cooperation with Moscow. (Since Russia is the weaker party and has comparatively limited leverage, it has little to gain from this approach and would more probably continue its attempts to exploit frustration with America to cultivate individual governments.) The United States would be in the strongest position to discourage interaction with Russia in dealing with the governments most dependent on its protection, for example, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. That said, if the United States looks less willing to exercise its power, its partners will be less dependent and less subject to such pressure. Conversely, as US military planners see a greater risk of conflict with Russia, they will generate pressure inside the US government to place greater value on existing alliance relationships and partnerships around the world. Here, governments hosting major military bases might find that they have new influence in dealing with Washington. In the Middle East, this would apply especially to countries with US naval and air bases that would be necessary to interdict Russian forces in any conflict (also the Arab Gulf nations) \u2014 again, recognizing that this is currently a remote possibility. During the Cold War, this dynamic generally reduced official US scrutiny of its partners\u2019 domestic practices, something both President Barack Obama and former President George W.

In this way, the war on terror is privatized, the American economy is bled dry, and the military-security industrial complex makes a killing \u2014 literally and figuratively speaking. The war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan has already cost taxpayers  and could go as high as $4.4 trillion before it\u2019s all over. At least $31 billion (and as much as $60 billion or more) of that $2 trillion was  by military contractors, who do everything from janitorial and food service work to construction, security and intelligence \u2014 jobs that used to be handled by the military. That translates to a loss of  since the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan. To put it another way, the government is spending more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Over the past , America has become increasingly dependent on military contractors in order to carry out military operations abroad (in fact, the government\u2019s extensive use of private security contractors has ). According to the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States  or respond to major disasters without heavy support from contractors. As a result, the U.S. employs at a minimum  deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq (that number increases dramatically when U.S. troop numbers decrease). For those signing on for contractor work, many of whom are hired by private contracting firms after serving stints in the military, it is a lucrative, albeit dangerous, career path (private contractors are 2.75 times  than troops). Incredibly, while base pay for an American soldier hovers somewhere around $19,000 per year, contractors are reportedly pulling in between . The exact number of military contractors on the U.S. payroll is hard to pin down, thanks to sleight-of-hand accounting by the Department of Defense and its contractors. However, according to a Wartime Contracting Commission report released in August 2011, there are  in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than the number of ground troops . As noted, that number increases dramatically when troops are withdrawn from an area, as we currently see happening in Iraq. Pratap Chatterjee of the Center for American Progress  that \u201cif the Obama administration draws down to 68,000 troops in Afghanistan by September 2012, they will need 88,400 contractors at the very least, but potentially as many as 95,880.\u201d With paid contractors often , the American war effort dubbed by George W. Bush as the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d has since evolved into the \u201ccoalition of the billing.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s Central Command  225,000 contractors working in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Between December 2008 and December 2010, the total number of private security contractors in Afghanistan  by 413% while troop levels increased 200%. Private contractors provide a number of services, including transport, construction, drone operation, and security. One military contractor, , is composed of former CIA operatives who go on secret missions to recover missing and captured US soldiers. Then there is the  which became famous for engaging in covert psychological operations by planting stories in the Iraqi press that glorified the U.S. mission.  guards the consulate in Basra for $401 million.  protects the US embassy for $974 million. Unfortunately, fraud, mismanagement and corruption have become synonymous with the U.S. government\u2019s use of military contractors.  \u201cfound that U.S. government funding for at least 15 large-scale programs and projects [in Afghanistan] grew from just over $1 billion to nearly $3 billion despite the government\u2019s questions about their effectiveness or cost.\u201d One program started off as a modest wheat program and \u201cballooned into one of America\u2019s biggest counterinsurgency projects in southern Afghanistan despite misgivings about its impact.\u201d Another multi-billion-dollar program resulted in the construction of schools, clinics and other public buildings that were so poorly built that they might not withstand a serious earthquake and will have to be rebuilt. Then there was the $300 million diesel power plant that was built despite the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be used regularly \u201cbecause its fuel cost more than the Afghan government could afford to run it regularly.\u201d RWA, a group of three Afghan contractors, was selected to build a 17.5 mile paved road in Ghazni province. They were paid $4 million between 2008 and 2010 before the with only 2/3 of a mile of road paved. Mind you, with the U.S. spending more than $2 billion a week in Afghanistan, these examples of ineptitude and waste represent only a fraction of what is being funded by American taxpayer dollars. (Investigative  reveal that large amounts of cash derived from U.S. aid and logistics spending are being flown out of the country on a regular basis by Afghan officials, including $52 million by the Afghan vice president, who was allowed to keep the money.)

A balance of power existed between aligned nations cloaked in vibrant, robust militaries ready to defend their countries. The enemies of peaceful nations knew the costs, as President John F. Kennedy echoed that sentiment during his famous inaugural address about defending freedom and defeating foes. Those days are now gone, however, they can be revived again using deterrence that keeps worldwide war at bay.  We are living in treacherous times, and war could break out anywhere on the seven continents across the world. Our current predicaments are beginning to make the early 1930s look pale in comparison to what is happening today, because deterrence has been allowed to linger and stall since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Collectively, we seem to have thought that history has stopped since the East and West German divide came down; but instead, we are witnessing a sharp upticks in wars, constant belligerence from the Middle East, the South China Sea dispute, and Mexico\u2019s unending drug war. New threats are doing away with the resources to cope with refugee problems, the spread of terrorism, but most importantly the embrace of negative constructivism to resolve conflict.  Foreign Affairs magazine describe ten hotspots for 2017, or flashpoints globally that if not dealt with swiftly and even harshly could lead to war. Interestingly enough, Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t mention China, North Korea, Russia or Iran. It can be argued that North Korea claiming they can fire an ICBM anytime and outgoing Secretary Kerry saying, \u201cthe U.S. may need more forceful ways of dealing with North Korea,\u201d is a hotter spot than Ukraine.  Deterrence is the best answer for dealing with those nations. The type of deterrence at the forefront of the Cold War, which had far-reaching geopolitical implications, otherwise the future is cloaked in profoundly destabilizing actions by those four nations.  Gambling with the four above-mentioned nations without proper deterrence won\u2019t work, but if done forcefully, then the other ten described foreign policy unknowns can be solved. If not, then jittery states from Europe to East Asia will begin to parse out safe real estate for their citizens if someone doesn\u2019t step up. Historically that has been the United States (U.S.) since World War II. The U.S. structured a system based upon mutually agreed upon principles between major powers to keep World War III at bay.  Certainly that order has been was in flux recently, and disagreements rage about how this new discombobulating order began. There isn\u2019t a correct answer. Moreover, add in the Rwanda genocide, the Yugoslavia breakup, and leaving Iraq after a brutal, tentative victory was achieved, and still there aren\u2019t answers, which is the problem. But this cooperative, championed order, leading to unprecedented prosperity and peace, is suffering its share of dire crisis unless deterrence is restored. And Washington\u2019s and NATO\u2019s retrenchment is only leading to what will eventually see Japan, South Korea, and the Sunni coalition led by the Saudis join the nuclear club.  Let\u2019s also not forget about India and Pakistan, who play a daily nuclear cat and mouse game in Kashmir. If Kashmir explodes, then does the U.S. intervene? China has an interest, and believes they can overtake India quickly. If China commits troops would other countries in the region follow suit? Another dangerous tightrope situation without a net while the basics of geopolitics continue forward wondering who will do the heavy lifting to sustain the international system.  Furthermore, will it be U.S. hard power or European soft power that restores deterrence? The perceived threats that the Iran nuclear deal were supposed to buffer haven\u2019t kept the Islamic Republic from buying uranium and keeping oil prices low by taking advantage of OPEC\u2019s weakness to boost their market share.  The Russians have seen fit to meddle in U.S., European, and former Soviet satellite elections at will while still threatening Ukraine. If Ukraine goes back to the Russians and out of NATO\u2019s orbit then Europe will have to grow NATO and American troop presence more than it has in recent years.  The echoes of Russian aggression will have returned to Cold War levels, but it\u2019s the correct move for deterrence to work, moving troops into Poland and Norway. The world wants peace, and this is a perfect example of military moves bolstering deterrence without a single shot being fired.  The European structure is being shaken as never before, and while some see a messy Brexit, that\u2019s not what the facts say. Recently it was reported Britain has the number one growing advanced economy in the world. Yet what happens if Germany, the Netherlands and France leave the EU based upon these facts? Can the world afford to lose the European voice, its large economy, and its reliance upon soft power? Will Europe become splintered and fractured at best, and at worst, allow regional historical rivalries to return, sparking conflicts that could make the proxy wars taking place in Syria, Iraq and Yemen seem tame. The balance Europe brings can\u2019t afford to be lost.  Here\u2019s why the international system needs robust deterrence without war. Terrorism is the pretense of a common enemy, but that model can\u2019t sustain itself. It is an illusion for nations to endlessly fight without a tactic to define a strategy. World War II was decisive, because there was a common, definable enemy that allowed for tactics and strategy leading to victory. Today\u2019s terrorism fight has none of those modalities in place.  Thriving on chaos will not lead to building blocks for a stable future. This type of tactical bargaining has no long-term strategy or common values within their policies. Maybe a Turkish-Russian rapprochement holds promise, but historical enmity more than likely will win over long-term solutions being offered in Syria through this false promise. Considering Beijing\u2019s war-like posture towards East Asia, the incoming Trump administration, Africa, and Latin America \u2013 what the world needs is overwhelming deterrence when dealing with China. Chaos can be managed, but only through deterrence.  Realpolitik and deal-making isn\u2019t a guide to stable long-term solutions. Economic sanctions were crippling Iran until they were removed, and can work again if world powers have the vision to do what is necessary. That is a great example of soft power deterrence backed by hard power. Yet deals, like fluid relationships, can be broken, and our world is now made up of diverse states with globalized, vested interests. It can\u2019t be stated enough that someone has to step up and keep the order with military-powered deterrence or with crippling economic sanctions to pull these nonstate actors and proxies off the world stage.  Many would say no single power could have singularity when it comes to controlling major powers or events. Manipulation can take place in the case of Libya when NATO, led somewhat by the U.S., bombed them into a fractured society. But real deterrence with military hard power had brought Gadhafi to his senses. He was working with the Americans, Europeans, and democratized Asian countries to denounce his nuclear program and terrorism. That only came about because he saw what happened to Saddam Hussein. That was lethal deterrence in force, and not a sanitized environment that brought Gadhafi to his senses.  Here\u2019s what should immediately happen for deterrence to be restored. First, build a large, lethal blue-water navy, as the incoming U.S. administration is proposing. Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea have to be checked globally, and a fully equipped naval presence from freedom-loving nations accomplishes that task. Next, other NATO alliance members should follow the example of Norway, and their policy of burden sharing toward Europe\u2019s collective defense. They pay their fair share when so many others don\u2019t. NATO led by the U.S. has to demand every alliance member dedicates 2% of their budget to their military, which assists keeping the NATO alliance intact. Economically, push infrastructure and energy portfolios led by fossil fuel with renewables in the background while they overcome their problems.  If developing nations pushed natural gas as soft power deterrence, and worked on infrastructure bottlenecks delivering inexpensive natural gas from the Marcellus shale in the U.S. to exporting LNG across the globe then the most basic component of modern life \u2013 cheap, scalable energy \u2013 is secured. Nations that thrive economically are less willing to interrupt their prosperity with war and hostility towards other nations.

These countries have so much at stake in the future of Iraq that it is natural they would seek to influence political developments in the country. Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians, Syrians, and others are very unlikely to go to war either to protect their own sect or ethnic group or to prevent one country from gaining the upper hand in Iraq. The reasons are fairly straightforward. First, Middle Eastern leaders, like politicians everywhere, are primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation. Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq. Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict. Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom. Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.

Russia\u2019s arms sales to Iran \u2014 and US pursuit of the nuclear agreement \u2014 similarly take on additional flavor. Over time, this dynamic could increasingly lead Washington to lobby its partners in the Middle East to choose sides by limiting their cooperation with Moscow. (Since Russia is the weaker party and has comparatively limited leverage, it has little to gain from this approach and would more probably continue its attempts to exploit frustration with America to cultivate individual governments.) The United States would be in the strongest position to discourage interaction with Russia in dealing with the governments most dependent on its protection, for example, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. That said, if the United States looks less willing to exercise its power, its partners will be less dependent and less subject to such pressure. Conversely, as US military planners see a greater risk of conflict with Russia, they will generate pressure inside the US government to place greater value on existing alliance relationships and partnerships around the world. Here, governments hosting major military bases might find that they have new influence in dealing with Washington. In the Middle East, this would apply especially to countries with US naval and air bases that would be necessary to interdict Russian forces in any conflict (also the Arab Gulf nations) \u2014 again, recognizing that this is currently a remote possibility.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991). Such examples provide support that the United States rarely suspends military assistance in the face of its security imperatives. The potential reverse causality between military aid and onesided violence is further discussed and tested in the empirical section of the article.", ""], "id": "e2a347ccd0c213d78a8c3154a6c723bbb183d91c43b026a50e3c8f32e7c14c37", "highlighted_text": "aid decrease one-sided violence rooted in effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost capacity to conduct targeted military operations aid increases recipient\u2019s will to comply to avoid becoming victim of other coercive policies signals an alliance that enhance recipient\u2019s international standing Pakistan assist U S overthrowing Taliban regime over becoming a target counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S Governments will lose legitimacy with increased victimization and will reinforce support for rebels aid provide governments with means to maintain legitimacy while conducting security operations, and minimiz reliance on civilian targeting aid help states overcome deficiencies that necessitated violence.

Figures from the Campaign Against Arms Trade reveal that last year the UK issued \u00a3221m worth of arms licences to defence companies exporting to Israel. This made Israel the UK\u2019s eighth largest market for UK arms companies, a huge increase on the previous year\u2019s figure of \u00a386m, itself a substantial rise on the \u00a320m worth of arms licensed in 2015. In total, over the past five years, Israel has bought more than \u00a3350m worth of UK military hardware. Licences issued to UK defence contractors exporting to Israel last year include those for targeting equipment, small arms ammunition, missiles, weapon sights and sniper rifles. In 2016 the UK issued licences for anti-armour ammunition, gun mountings, components for air-to-air missiles, targeting equipment, components for assault rifles, components for grenade-launchers and anti-riot shields.

Ending this aid along with U.S. aid to all foreign countries \u2014 call it the Rand Paul Doctrine \u2014 would actually leave Israel better off, he claimed to raised eyebrows. Criticism was quick, especially from Israel\u2019s supporters in the U.S. Said Senator Bill Nelson: \u201cIsrael needs the full assistance of the U.S. It\u2019s the only way Israel can remain secure.\u201d Said the National Jewish Democratic Council: \u201cSenator Paul\u2019s misguided views on aid to Israel are plain wrong.\u201d In fact, the Rand Paul Doctrine is eminently sensible and should be seen as such, including to Israel\u2019s supporters. Paul\u2019s assessment that U.S. \u201caid hampers Israel\u2019s ability to make its own decisions as it sees fit\u201d is indisputable, as is his assessment that the U.S. gift of military hardware represents lost contracts for Israel\u2019s defence industries. Fresh eyes on Israel\u2019s need for U.S. help would be salutary. For starters, let\u2019s dispense with the myth that, but for the grace of the U.S. government, Israel could never have survived against its much more populous and better-armed enemies. In the first decades following Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, the U.S was less friend than foe, generally siding with Israel\u2019s Arab neighbours, whom the U.S courted for their oil wealth and to keep them out of the Soviet sphere. The U.S. not only gave Israel little economic and no military aid in the early years \u2014 the first military grant wouldn\u2019t come until 1974, a quarter century after Israel\u2019s founding \u2014 it refused to even sell arms to help the fledgling state defend itself. Meanwhile, the U.S. not only sold arms to Israel\u2019s enemies, it also lavished them with economic and military aid through a Marshall-type plan for the Middle East. Worse, the U.S. used the full force of its diplomacy to undermine Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself. In 1956, after Egypt blockaded shipping into Israel and seized the Suez Canal, an international waterway owned by the U.K. and France, the three countries jointly invaded Egypt to restore their rights. Although U.S. president Eisenhower acknowledged that Egypt\u2019s \u201cgrave and repeated provocations\u201d had led to the invasion, he decided to curry friendship with the Arab world by forcing the invaders to withdraw. To bring to heel a resistant U.K., which was still destitute after its losses during World War II, Eisenhower threatened to financially cripple it, by selling U.K. bonds to devalue the pound and blocking a $1-billion IMF loan that the U.K. desperately needed. To get Israel to withdraw from territories captured in the war, which it refused to do without guarantees that Egypt would cease attacking its civilians and its ships, Eisenhower threatened Israel with expulsion from the UN, adding gravitas to his demands by making them in a radio and television address to the American people from the White House. The U.S. attitude toward Israel changed, and the military aid began, only after the U.S. realized that Israel had built a potent military that it could enlist in thwarting Soviet ambitions in the Middle East. Even then, from Israel\u2019s perspective the U.S. aid often amounted to compensation, to persuade Israel to act in what would otherwise have been against its own interests. For example, after Israel won the Sinai peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six Day War, the Sinai became a valuable asset of Israel\u2019s, partly because it served as a buffer to thwart future Egyptian attacks, partly because Israel discovered oil there, a commodity needed by both its military and economy. When Egypt failed to get the Sinai back in its 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, it decided to cut a deal with the U.S. \u2014 it would switch sides in the Cold War, abandoning the U.S.S.R. for the U.S., if the U.S. could persuade Israel to abandon the Sinai, along with the oil and military bases it had built there. The U.S. agreed to the deal, and obtained Israel\u2019s agreement by providing it with partial compensation. Subsequent large military grants were also tied to Israel\u2019s agreement to serve some U.S. geopolitical interest. In recent decades the U.S. has been more friend than foe, the two countries having developed a strong alliance, and U.S. military aid to Israel has grown to its current $3- billion per year level (Israel now receives no economic aid). But the common view by Israel\u2019s supporters and haters alike that Israel needs a $3-billion handout for its survival is nonsense. Israel has a powerhouse economy \u2014 the best performing in the developed world \u2014 that could easily absorb a $3-billion hit, which amounts to about 1% of its GDP. When Israel was poor, its military absorbed a whopping one-third of its GDP. As Israel became affluent and its military more efficient over the decades, the cost steadily dropped to 25% of GDP, then 20%, then 10%, then 7.5% and now approximately 6.5% of GDP. If Israel needed to assume the full cost of its military, the cost would merely revert to 7.5% temporarily before resuming its downward trajectory. That downward trajectory would likely speed up under a Rand Paul doctrine, which would also deny aid to Israel\u2019s neighbours. With Egypt and the Palestinians shorn of U.S. arms, Israel would be able to shrug off much of its defence burden, which today remains more than three times the Western world\u2019s average. Israel\u2019s defence spending would also drop because it wouldn\u2019t be as reliant on expensive U.S. arms \u2014 under terms of its military aid agreement with the U.S., about $2.25- billion of the $3-billion must be spent on U.S. arms suppliers, whose merchandise often needs to be retrofitted to meet Israeli needs. Paul\u2019s other arguments \u2014 that Israel\u2019s military industries would benefit once the Israeli government wasn\u2019t tied to buying American and that \u201cour money sometimes clouds the sovereignty of Israel\u201d \u2014 are, if anything, understatements. Although Israel\u2019s arms industry is one of the world\u2019s largest, it has been thwarted on numerous occasions by the U.S., which blocked Israeli arms sales to China and Russia, and stopped Israel from building military jets that could compete with America\u2019s.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991).

For example, while sub-Saharan Africa received $714 billion in development aid from 1960 to 2006 (Easterly 2008, 14), its per capita income grew by less than 1 percent per year over this period,2 and its poverty rate has scarcely changed (Chen and Ravallion 2004). These grim statistics beg the question: Why has develop-ment aid failed to achieve its goals? One possible answer is that it is simply not used for its intended purpose. Research shows that aid is fungible (Feyzioglu, Swaroop, and Zhu 1998): that is, aid given for one purpose allows governments to shift resources to other uses. If these other uses do not encourage economic growth or development, neither will aid. A recent New York Times article on Uganda illustrates this point.3 Although Uganda has received considerable foreign aid designated for health care, its hospitals remain starved for resources. This is because foreign aid has allowed the government to cut its own health care spending: specifically, for each additional aid dollar received, Uganda cut its health care spending by 57 cents (IHME 2010). Although it is not clear where the budgetary savings went, a concurrent rise in military spending suggests that Uganda exploited its development aid to reallocate funds from health care to the mili-tary. If so, it is no surprise that this aid did li le to improve the lives of Uganda\u2019s people. The Uganda example suggests that governments may, more generally, divert aid funds from developmental uses to military spending. This would be disturbing in at least two ways. First, military spending does not promote development: studies show that its impact on growth is nonexistent at best and negative at worst (Dunne and Uye 2009). Second, military resources are often used to repress domestic dissent. For example, in the \u201cArab Spring\u201d of 2011, governments across the Middle East and North Africa used their armed forces to intimidate prodemocracy protesters. If development aid is gener-ally diverted to military spending, it could thus have pernicious economic and political e\ufb00ects."], "id": "ae233e579844e043c854a66f66fdfc3549d85dc87666055e9013209cd3f814cb", "highlighted_text": "rich countries gave three trillion in development aid return has been poor: it is not used for its intended purpose Uganda received aid designated for health Uganda exploited its development aid to reallocate funds from health care to the mili-tary governments divert aid funds to military spending.", "highlights": [[2, 23, 42], [2, 63, 77], [2, 86, 104], [2, 111, 117], [2, 137, 151], [2, 673, 678], [2, 686, 719], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1770, 1791]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 22], [2, 23, 42], [2, 43, 62], [2, 63, 77], [2, 78, 85], [2, 86, 104], [2, 104, 110], [2, 111, 117], [2, 118, 136], [2, 137, 151], [2, 152, 254], [2, 254, 267], [2, 268, 287], [2, 591, 607], [2, 607, 611], [2, 612, 672], [2, 673, 678], [2, 679, 685], [2, 686, 719], [2, 719, 758], [2, 758, 767], [2, 767, 967], [2, 968, 1002], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1010, 1054], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1064, 1084], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1111, 1160], [2, 1369, 1480], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1571, 1572], [2, 1663, 1695], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1708, 1728], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1746, 1769], [2, 1770, 1791]], "emphasis": [[2, 23, 42], [2, 63, 77], [2, 86, 104], [2, 111, 117], [2, 137, 151], [2, 673, 678], [2, 686, 719], [2, 1003, 1009], [2, 1055, 1063], [2, 1085, 1110], [2, 1481, 1561], [2, 1562, 1571], [2, 1696, 1707], [2, 1729, 1745], [2, 1770, 1791]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 18], [19, 24]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-01"}, {"tag": "Removal of military assistance opens up the floodgates for sanctions \u2013 empirics prove.", "cite": "Nielsen writes- Richard A.

Following the rhetorical claims of donors, most studies assume that donors will sanction all repressive states equally. In reality, aid sanctions are applied selectively to some human rights violators but not to others. Aid sanctions are rarely if ever applied to countries that are donor allies or have other strong political connections to donor countries. The theoretical literature has recognized that some states might avoid aid sanctions because of their connections to donors (Tomasevski 1997:21) but this insight has not informed quantitative studies of aid sanctions (for an exception, see Barratt 2008). The second misconception of the existing studies is that donors impose blanket sanctions that reduce all types of aid. Past scholarship has overlooked sanctions episodes by failing to recognize that donors typically withdraw aid for economic sectors but continue to extend aid for basic social services and human rights protection. The remainder of this section describes these two points in more detail. I start from a simple set of state-centered, rationalist assumptions to argue that aid donors will apply aid sanctions selectively. The literature linking human rights and foreign aid has largely avoided reference to the dominant theoretical trends of IR theory (for exceptions, see Lai 2003; Barratt 2008). Breaking with this tradition, I explicitly develop a rationalist theory of selective aid sanctions and contrast it to alternative explanations inspired by Constructivism. Starting from the assumption that aid donors are allocating aid in ways that serve their self-interest and security, I first identify situations where aid recipients will not face aid sanctions when they violate human rights. Most obviously, donors rarely apply aid sanctions to states with which they have important strategic ties, such as military alliances. The reason for this is intuitive; aid is often used to buy influence abroad (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith 2009) and withdrawing aid puts these important strategic relationships in jeopardy. Less formal political ties also protect some repressive states from aid sanctions, including the willingness of developing countries to trade United Nations votes for aid (Dreher, Sturm and Vreeland 2009). States that rotate onto the UN Security Council receive roughly 60% more US aid relative to other countries, presumably because of their enhanced ability to assist US interests (Kuziemko and Werker 2006). There are even circumstances where donors might increase aid to repressive allies. Regimes often violate human rights because they face increased pressure from political opposition (Davenport 2000; Vreeland 2008) so donors friendly to the regime may increase aid flows to help the allied regime stay in power. This leads to the first hypothesis."], "id": "2cd9c276cf720f4ee666d6a0a1f95fdf4e8a123278ce686eac5b2b9645eef47e", "highlighted_text": "states avoid sanctions because of their connections to donors donors withdraw aid for economic sectors donors apply sanctions selectively. allocating aid in ways that serve self-interest and security donors rarely apply sanctions to states with important strategic ties, such as military alliances aid is used to buy influence abroad withdrawing aid puts important strategic relationships in jeopardy.

Yet, policy-oriented reflections on the record of sanctions turn out to be discouraging. Economic sanctions do not produce regime change, and entail certain potential and acknowledged disadvantages.23 Suffering as a result of economic sanctions could contribute to labour unrest, further repression and the like. Moreover, informed leaders, at various times, have expressed scepticism about sanctions. A prominent example is the opposition of President George H.W. Bush to economic sanctions against China in the aftermath of Tian\u2019anmen Square in 1989, on the grounds of their probable ineffectiveness.24 Consider the US\u2019s rate of success (i.e., change in policy by a target government) from applying sanctions: 1980\u20131989\u201414%; 1990\u20131999\u201426%.25 The figures for unilateral US implementation of economic sanctions are even lower. Longstanding cases like Cuba, Iran, and North Korea demonstrate that, whether regime change specifically or human rights in general are deemed most relevant, economic sanctions remain ineffective. Hufbauer and Oegg observe in particular that arms embargoes are \u2018debatable\u2019 as a means towards ending conflict. With a focus on state repression and economic sanctions, Wood analyses annual data for 157 states from 1976 to 2001,26 and finds that sanctions implemented by the US are associated with higher levels of government repression. Results from Peksen and Drury, meanwhile, link economic sanctions to lower levels of government respect for physical integrity rights and higher levels of repression over comparable periods.27 In short, it is difficult to envision economic sanctions, by the US alone or in conjunction with others, as an appropriate means towards greater respect for human rights abroad.

Even a small drawdown of U.S. military personnel would reverberate loudly there, as would moving \u2014 or even announcing a study of moving \u2014 any piece of the U.S. military presence out of Bahrain. Perhaps more important, there\u2019s a great struggle over whose \u201cnarrative\u201d will prevail in Bahrain: the government\u2019s, arguing that its crackdown is designed to oppose terrorism and maintain stability; or that of the opposition, arguing that the country is becoming increasingly repressive toward peaceful protests and human rights. If the United States were to side publicly, and loudly, with the opposition, the outcome of the argument would be affected. More public pressure might well force the royals to think harder about compromises, and strengthen the hand of those who are privately arguing for reform. Instead, the United States has not only remained largely silent on human rights abuses, but has acted in ways that can only convince the Bahraini government to ignore any quiet protests that are actually made. In 2012, when Congress objected to arms sales to Bahrain because of the repression there, the Obama administration used a loophole to continue the sales. As Foreign Policy reported, the State Department is required to formally notify Congress of any arms sales over $1 million. According to a congressional source, rather than going through the notification process, the administration divided up an arms sales package into multiple sales, each of which was less than $1 million \u2014 thereby dodging congressional oversight. That was 2012. In 2013, the Navy announced that it was adding five more coastal patrol ships to American forces in Bahrain. Last year, the Obama administration went forward with a more than half-billion-dollar expansion of the U.S. presence in Bahrain, which will cement the U.S. presence in the country for decades to come. Now, what signal does that send the royals? \u201cWith each passing day, the Bahrain government\u2019s self-fulfilling prophecy of a sectarian war is becoming more and more the reality,\u201d Reza Aslan wrote in 2013. \u201cIf that happens \u2014 if the Bahrain uprising descends into the kind of regional holy war between Sunni and [Shiite] \u2014 the United States will not be able to avoid the consequences.\u201d That message holds true for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, which makes one wonder why it is smart to assume that the facilities the United States has in Bahrain will in fact be available \u2014 or safe to use \u2014 in the coming decades. Meanwhile, the announcement of the expansion can only be read one way by the Bahraini authorities: The American protests about human rights conditions are not serious. It didn\u2019t have to be this way \u2014 nobody forced the United States to turn a blind eye to Bahrain\u2019s explosive domestic situation. Consider an alternative path: Suppose a top-level messenger, such as the chief of naval operations or chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had been sent to Bahrain to say, \u201cLook, I personally would like this base expansion. But there\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to happen until the repression stops. In fact, we are going to announce that naval facilities elsewhere in the Gulf will be examined for future expansion to replace Bahrain, because Bahrain is viewed as increasingly unstable. Guys, you\u2019ve got three months to start showing us something.\u201d Such a message \u2014 and if necessary, a public statement a few months later \u2014 would have had a huge impact. It would have shown the Bahraini government and its supporters the risks they face; it would have made the business community nervous, and perhaps more supportive of reform; and above all, it might have given additional ammunition to those in the royal family who favor reconciliation over repression. Instead, the Obama administration is sending the clear message that its loud protests are over, the president won\u2019t speak about Bahrain, and the monarchy can relax. In fact, no one should relax about Bahrain. It is on a path toward increasing instability, featuring growing Sunni extremism, growing Shiite outrage, and ever-widening sectarian divisions. The Fifth Fleet is a hostage, and the Obama administration is spending hundreds of millions of dollars there as if America\u2019s welcome will be permanent. That\u2019s a suspect assumption: As the majority of Bahrainis conclude that the United States is indifferent to the crackdown and siding with the most regressive elements of the royal family, support for the Fifth Fleet\u2019s presence will start to disappear. As will Bahrain\u2019s very sovereignty, as it is caught up in the regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Once upon a time, Bahrain was an outpost of civility and moderation in the Middle East. Now, it is coming to share the pathologies of its neighbors. That\u2019s tragic, and it is in part the result of weak American policy. By placing security matters \u2014 Bahrain\u2019s minuscule participation in the anti-Islamic State coalition and its hosting of the Fifth Fleet \u2014 above all other considerations, the Obama administration is putting that very security relationship at risk. Once upon a time, Bahrain was also an example of a sensible Obama human rights policy.

The congressional offices that led the charge to oppose the original Bahrain arms sales package are upset that the State Department has decided to move forward with the new package. The opposition to Bahrain arms sales is led by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), and also includes Senate Foreign Relations Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee chairman Robert Casey (D-PA), Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Benjamin Cardin (D-MD), and Marco Rubio (R-FL). Wyden and Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) have each introduced a resolution in their respective chambers to prevent the U.S. government from going through with the original sale, which would have included 44 armored, high-mobility Humvees and over 300 advanced missiles. The State Department has not released details of the new sale, and Congress has not been notified through the regular process, which requires posting the information on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) website. The State Department simply briefed a few congressional offices and is going ahead with the new sale, arguing it didn\u2019t meet the threshold that would require more formal notifications and a public explanation. At today\u2019s State Department press briefing, The Cable asked spokeswoman Victoria Nuland about the new sale. She acknowledged the new package but didn\u2019t have any details handy. Our congressional sources said that State is using a legal loophole to avoid formally notifying Congress and the public about the new arms sale. The administration can sell anything to anyone without formal notification if the sale is under $1 million. If the total package is over $1 million, State can treat each item as an individual sale, creating multiple sales of less than $1 million and avoiding the burden of notification, which would allow Congress to object and possibly block the deal. We\u2019re further told that State is keeping the exact items in the sale secret, but is claiming they are for Bahrain\u2019s \"external defense\" and therefore couldn\u2019t be used against protesters.

Over the next decades, that evolved into a much larger presence, with Bahrain eventually becoming the host for the headquarters of the United States Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet. The United Kingdom also had a military presence in Bahrain, but that ended in 1971, which is also the year that the United States established a diplomatic presence in the tiny Kingdom. The strategic interests that this island nation presents to the United States are quite significant. Geographically, it contains some ideal port facilities for the U.S. Navy to use as a strategic base for pursuing security interests throughout the region. Geo-politically, Bahrain is a worthy partner nation for the United States for a number of reasons. Due to its stature as a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Bahrain remains a very important ally for U.S. security interests in the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf. Second, Bahrain is a sectarian flash point between the Sunni-dominated and fellow-GCC members as Saudi Arabia, and Shia-dominated Iran, which exerts her influence in the region from across the waters of the gulf. Bahrain is ruled by a Sunni monarchy that is allied with its fellow Sunni monarchies in the GCC, but the majority of the population is Shia, raining great concern among its GCC partners and U.S. allies for the potential of Iranian influence and intrigue. 4 Security Assistance The U.S. provides security assistance to Bahrain through military training. Small amounts of International Military Education and Training funds (IMET) are provided to Bahrain. Along with improving Bahrain\u2019s defenses and their interoperability with US forces, other US goals are to inculcate principles of civilian control of the military and democracy. Bahrain was also part of the U.S. led allied coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. It allowed the stationing of 17,500 U.S. troops and 250 U.S. combat aircraft at Shaikh Isa Air Base that participated in the 1991 \u201cDesert Storm\u201d offensive against Iraqi forces. In March 2002, President George W. Bush designated Bahrain a \u201cmajor non-NATO-ally\u201d. That designation qualifies Bahrain to purchase certain U.S. arms, receive excess defense articles (EDA), and engage in defense research cooperation with the U.S. for which that it would not otherwise qualify.5 In recent years, the United States has continued to sell military arms to Bahrain. Most U.S. military assistance to Bahrain is Foreign Military Financing (FMF). In 2007, the United States sold Bahrain several hundred \u201cJavelin\u201d anti-armor missiles, 9 UH-60M Blackhawk helicopters, and 6 Bell search and recovery helicopters. In September 2011, the United States announced a sale to the Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) and Bahrain National Guard of 44 Humvee armored vehicles, and several hundred TOW missiles, including 50 \u201cbunker busters.\u201d In 2012, the United States announced the release of additional U.S. arms to the BDF, Ministry of Interior (MOI), and Bahrain\u2019s National Guard. Accordingly about 85% of Bahrain\u2019s defense equipment is of U.S.-origin. The United States also provides training to Bahrain\u2019s military and Ministry of Interior (MI).6 Security Cooperation According to the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Bahrain supports the United States operationally and logistically through its hosting of their Naval Forces Central Command. This enables the United States to lead a 30 nation military coalition that counters piracy and terrorism, and helps maintain the free flow of commerce and energy resources through the Strait of Hormuz. Bahrain supports U.S.-led military coalitions, including the current international effort against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (2016).7", ""], "id": "93b91ababa7a868a1628282ffcff2204f06a94c9241965b29dd80b0a7f09dbbe", "highlighted_text": "administration has been delaying its $53 million arms sale to Bahrain due to human rights concerns administration officials told congressional offices they will move forward with a different package of arms sales without notification to the public State is using a legal loophole to avoid notifying Congress The administration can sell anything to anyone without notification if the sale is under $1 million State can treat each item as an individual sale creating multiple sales of less than $1 million and avoiding the burden of notification Bahrain has been of strategic importance to the U S since 1948 Bahrain is a worthy partner nation Bahrain remains a very important ally for U.S. security interests in the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf The U.S. provides security assistance to Bahrain through military training Along with improving Bahrain\u2019s defenses and their interoperability with US forces , other US goals are to inculcate principles of civilian control of the military and democracy Bush designated Bahrain a \u201cmajor non-NATO-ally\u201d the U S has continued to sell military arms to Bahrain.

Bahrain can become one of Moscow\u2019s strongest allies in the region. The latest developments in the Middle East suggest that Moscow is trying to play on the changing attitudes of the countries in the region towards the United States. The behavior of the U.S. during the events of the Arab Spring, when Washington supported the protesters instead of its ally Hosni Mubarak, is pushing local countries to seek a more stable guarantor of security, which totally meets the interests of Moscow. In this situation, a small Bahrain can become a \u2018pressure point\u2019 for Russia vis-\u00e0-vis its rivals in the region. U.S. loses ground Bahrain is the main base for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th fleet. This naturally means that Washington has a major impact on decision-making in the wealthy country. Meanwhile, the U.S.\u2019s actions in recent years have forced Bahrain to start a review of its previous approaches to cooperation. The changing point was 2011, when during the Arab Spring Washington  the protesters in Egypt and refused to help its ally President Hosni Mubarak.  This fact combined with  in Bahrain raises a concern that in a crisis, Washington may abandon support for the current government in the island state. In addition, the United States in recent years has embarked on reducing its involvement in the Middle East. Therefore, not only Bahrain, even other Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf are losing confidence in Washington\u2019s ability and willingness to help resolve the Iranian problem. Russia, on the other hand, significantly increased its involvement in the region in the last two years. And since, unlike the White House, the Kremlin does not require compliance with human rights in exchange for the supply of weapons, for Bahrain relations with Russia are an alternative way of ensuring its own security. A mediator role For Russia, Bahrain is important because Manama is ready to become a mediator in Russia\u2019s negotiations with other Arab countries and particularly with Saudi Arabia over the handling of the Iranian problem. The willingness of Bahrain to become a mediator is confirmed by the fact that, according to the Ambassador of Bahrain to Russia this year Manama  a meeting of foreign ministers of Arab monarchies and Russia. This also suggests that the Arab States of the Persian Gulf  that Russia is today a force to be reckoned with in the region.

After the suppression of mass demonstrations in the kingdom led to casualties, France and the UK  their license for the supply of arms to Bahrain. In response, Manama  an agreement with Moscow for the supply of AK-103 assault rifles, and has launched a program to train the military of Bahrain.

Moreover, in November 2016 the King of Bahrain  Vladimir Putin to visit Bahrain, and in December 2016 the Russian state news agency Sputnik  that there is a list of companies from Bahrain ready to invest in Crimea.

These developments suggest that, despite the complicated relations of Moscow with Manama\u2019s allies, Bahrain and Russia continue to strengthen their relationship. Access to the arms market Despite a well-developed infrastructure, the most liberal legislation in the region and high level of economic development, the small size of Bahrain means it is not a big target for Russian businesses. At the same time, the country can be a convenient place to launch economic and political penetration in the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf.  First of all, in terms of sanctions and low oil prices, Russia  a lack of investment, so the Gulf countries are of direct interest. Bahrain  more than $50 million in retail, commercial real estate, mining and logistics services in Russia.

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there."], "id": "55bcc3899f3f68d5a78bd49c767053f5afb057839a6705093c1d425e1d952403", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

In\u00b6 the absence of such a policy statement every regional actor is hedging its bets and preparing for the worst in the future,\u00b6 a trend that most likely means intensified competition\u00b6 among the great, regional, and local powers for influence in\u00b6 Central Asia.\u00b6 ", ""], "id": "a06ac984abd09c301f0881ba6635768b80b76095b6fa20d379b8aa6f4679b6d8", "highlighted_text": "in light of fears for the stability every state, is jockeying for power in the region a vacuum will inevitably be filled by other actors every regional actor is hedging its bets and preparing for the worst that means intensified competition \u00b6", "highlights": [[2, 80, 82], [2, 87, 119], [2, 203, 215], [2, 232, 248], [2, 272, 291], [2, 1578, 1586], [2, 1649, 1690], [2, 1968, 2036], [2, 2061, 2065], [2, 2078, 2107], [2, 2107, 2108]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 67], [2, 69, 79], [2, 80, 82], [2, 83, 86], [2, 87, 119], [2, 146, 202], [2, 203, 215], [2, 232, 248], [2, 249, 271], [2, 272, 291], [2, 366, 369], [2, 375, 446], [2, 1339, 1387], [2, 1388, 1392], [2, 1578, 1586], [2, 1587, 1648], [2, 1649, 1690], [2, 1968, 2036], [2, 2055, 2060], [2, 2061, 2065], [2, 2066, 2077], [2, 2078, 2107], [2, 2107, 2108], [2, 2109, 2178], [2, 2179, 2184]], "emphasis": [[2, 80, 82], [2, 87, 119], [2, 203, 215], [2, 232, 248], [2, 249, 271], [2, 272, 291], [2, 1578, 1586], [2, 1649, 1690], [2, 1968, 2036], [2, 2061, 2065], [2, 2078, 2107]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-27"}, {"tag": "Russia is looking for more partners and views counternarcotics as key", "cite": "Stratfor 12 (Stratfor Worldview, \u201cRussian Counternarcotics Strategy in Central Asia\u201d ) / MM", "body": ["Officials seized 67 kilograms (147.7 pounds) of synthetic drugs in Tajikistan on May 22, one week after the head of Russia's Federal Drug Control Service, Viktor Ivanov, called drug production and trafficking in Central Asia a pressing issue. Ivanov said that up to 40 percent of Central Asian gross domestic product comes from criminal activities, especially from narcotics, and that Russia should fight the problem more actively. He added that Russia plans to implement 22 new counternarcotics programs in Central Asia to help protect its interests in the region. The flow of drugs from Central Asia into Russia is a significant problem for Moscow. Though completely eradicating drug trafficking is impossible, Moscow would like to gain as much control as it can over the illicit trade. This would let Moscow justify increasing its presence and influence in Central Asia, allowing it to counter U.S. activity there and preparing Russia for increased volatility in the region following the U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Several major drug trafficking routes begin in Afghanistan and enter Central Asia before moving north into Russia, northwest into Europe and east into China. Ninety percent of the drugs bound for Russia from Central Asia are not cultivated in the region, but rather in Afghanistan. Rampant drug abuse in Russia contributes to an already poor demographic situation and relatively low life expectancy. Significant numbers of men also fail to qualify for military duty due to failed drug tests and addiction. The government hopes to gain as much control of the trafficking networks as possible by removing organized criminal gangs that operate against Russian interests. Given the money to be made from drug trafficking, Moscow stands to profit from getting involved, something that the blurred lines between the Kremlin and Russian organized crime will facilitate. Counternarcotics efforts in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan offer Russia more than just money. Russia already wields significant influence in this crucial buffer zone, influence it would like to expand to offset the power of outside actors like the United States. U.S. activity in the region increased before and following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, when several Central Asian countries provided military bases for logistical assistance. While the United States has scaled back its military presence, Washington recently has become more active in counternarcotics efforts in Central Asia. Some of these efforts have been undertaken jointly with Russia. However, Russia did not respond warmly to a new joint program, the Central Asian Counternarcotics Initiative (CACI), which the United States proposed in February. CACI called for task forces in all five Central Asian countries to combat drug trafficking and share information with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but Moscow reportedly convinced the Central Asian countries not to participate. Ivanov said that while Washington and regional governments may welcome the program, Moscow considers it inconvenient. It is not that Russia objects to specific programs, though Moscow typically opposes any initiative not coordinated in advance with Russia. Instead, Moscow fears the programs could serve as a springboard for greater U.S. involvement in the region. An unnamed Russian official hinted at this in an interview with Kommersant, calling the CACI plan a new tool for infiltration into Central Asia and a means of strengthening U.S. military and political influence in the region. Greater involvement in counternarcotics efforts gives Russia a reason to expand its own presence in the region and to curb the power of other players such as the United States, which sometimes embeds intelligence assets in counternarcotics programs. Though Russia is set to increase its already sizable military and security presence in the region, particularly in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, this does not mean everything has gone Russia's way. For example, individual countries, especially Kyrgyzstan, continue to engage in bilateral counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. As recently as May 23, a counternarcotics checkpoint funded by the United States was set up on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Tajikistan has also rebuffed Russia's requests to let the Russian military resume patrolling the Tajik-Afghan border after the Tajik military replaced it in 2005. Even so, Russian advisers are still active on the border \u2014 a crucial crossing for regional smuggling routes \u2014 and Tajikistan has cooperated with Russia on border control in other areas, such as the Tajik-Uzbek border. Moscow also has assisted Dushanbe with security and counternarcotics sweeps within Tajikistan. Though increasing its counternarcotic efforts allows Russia to check outside powers and prepare for regional volatility following the NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan, going too far in these efforts carries risks, including angering traffickers and creating friction with regional governments. Given that Central Asia is seeing rising instability due to regional tensions and growing Islamist militancy, Russia will pursue its counternarcotics efforts with caution.", ""], "id": "1d9e183ce4ffde3543eb0ec0c2dcecb1a09f66480e5260e657b673b4dd2397e4", "highlighted_text": "Russia plans to implement new counternarcotics programs in Central Asia to help protect its interests in the region This let Moscow justify increasing its presence and influence in Central Asia, allowing it to counter U.S. activity there Moscow fears the programs could serve as a springboard for greater U.S. involvement in the region Russia is set to increase its military in the region Russia will pursue its counternarcotics efforts", "highlights": [[2, 446, 471], [2, 475, 564], [2, 789, 793], [2, 800, 916], [2, 3229, 3326], [2, 3811, 3840], [2, 3857, 3865], [2, 3888, 3901], [2, 5142, 5189]], "underlines": [[2, 104, 241], [2, 446, 471], [2, 472, 474], [2, 475, 564], [2, 564, 565], [2, 713, 788], [2, 789, 793], [2, 794, 799], [2, 800, 916], [2, 917, 1017], [2, 1687, 1782], [2, 2092, 2138], [2, 2139, 2176], [2, 3229, 3326], [2, 3554, 3730], [2, 3811, 3840], [2, 3841, 3856], [2, 3857, 3865], [2, 3866, 3887], [2, 3888, 3901], [2, 5142, 5189]], "emphasis": [[2, 446, 471], [2, 472, 474], [2, 475, 564], [2, 564, 565], [2, 1687, 1782], [2, 2092, 2138], [2, 2139, 2176], [2, 3229, 3326], [2, 5142, 5189]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 11]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-01"}, {"tag": "That triggers all of their impacts and turns case", "cite": "Seldin 18 (Jeff Seldin, Seldin works out of VOA\u2019s Washington headquarters and is national security correspondent specializing in Middle East peace negotiations.

The commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and of Operation Resolute Support, General John Nicholson, is scheduled to step down Sunday after serving in the position for more than two years. But before relinquishing command, he took time to cast doubts on Russia's intentions in the region, despite recent overtures from Moscow to help the Taliban reconcile with the Afghan government. \"We know that Russia is attempting to undercut our military gains and years of military progress in Afghanistan, and make partners question Afghanistan's stability,\" Nicholson said in an email to Voice of America, following on questions from his August 22 briefing with Pentagon reporters. \"It is no secret that Russia seeks any opportunity it can find to drive a wedge between the United States and our Central Asian partners, including Afghanistan,\" Nicholson added. Aid to Taliban U.S. and Afghan officials have previously accused Russia of meddling in Afghanistan by providing Taliban insurgents with both weapons and training. Moscow has rejected the allegations, saying it has only political ties with the Taliban. Still, Russia has faced growing suspicion from the U.S. and its allies, who say the Kremlin has been increasingly working to expand its influence in Afghanistan and beyond. Most recently, the U.S. and Russia have been competing over efforts to kick-start peace negotiations between the Taliban and the U.S.-backed Afghan government. Russia was set to host both parties, along with the U.S. and other countries, for talks starting September 4, but was forced to postpone after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani declined the invitation. The U.S. also has been hoping for talks between the government and the Taliban. \"We talk about an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned reconciliation process,\" U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said during a briefing with reporters this past week. \"We believe that the best way to get there is to ensure Taliban recognizes they can't win on the battlefield, they must negotiate.\" But while U.S. officials have touted what they see are signs of progress, including increased support for a peace process from various sectors of the Afghan population, the government's recent cease-fire offer to the Taliban appears to have fallen on deaf ears.

Since the start of its intervention in 2001, Washington and its drug war allies have tried every possible counter-narcotics option. All, without exception, have failed. The bulk of the US budget ($4.3 billion) was allocated to interdiction efforts, but ample funds were left for more experimental approaches, none of which seem to have worked. As much as Washington\u2019s drug policies failed, the UN efforts were, in Inspector Sopko\u2019s view, even less effective. During the first decade following its 2001 invasion, Washington was obsessed with counterterror operations and so outsourced the drug war to others.

Technological innovations can help in overcoming the first two challenges, but not the political ones.

Small drones in particular have a significant advantage over other forms of remote reconnaissance, since they can fly very low to identify drug crops grown under the cover of trees or interspersed with other plants. Drones can provide such intelligence in real time, and can be deployed over an area for a significant amount of time and thus monitor, for example, which drug traders are visiting the area to interact with which drug farmers. Another advantage of using drones for eradication instead of piloted airplanes is that there is no physical danger to the operating crew. Small drones that can maneuver among plants and distinguish between drug plants and legal crops promise precision of delivery and minimization of collateral damage.

The major components of U.S. strategy have been coca crop eradication, interdiction of cocaine, and alternative development programs, all with an eye to reducing the drug supply at its source. Successful eradication and interdiction efforts in the 1980s and 1990s in Peru and Bolivia\u2014then the largest suppliers\u2014inadvertently pushed cultivation to Colombia. Colombia has been the largest producer of both coca leaf and cocaine for more than a decade, but Colombia's portion of the world's coca cultivation declined from about 74% in 2000 to 43% in 2009, and continued to decline in 2010.45 As Colombia's coca cultivation has declined, however, the number of hectares under cultivation in Bolivia and particularly Peru has increased. Indeed, Peru's potential cocaine production of raw cocaine surpassed that of Colombia in 2010.46 These changes in production from one country back to another appear to provide evidence of the aforementioned balloon effect. Colombia's success in reducing its cultivation of coca and production of cocaine, with significant U.S. support, merits a close look. The framework for the current enforcement regime dates to 1999 when the government of President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana unveiled \"Plan Colombia.\" Plan Colombia was a strategy forged by Colombians in collaboration with U.S. advisors to end Colombia's decades-long armed conflict,47 combat drug trafficking, and promote economic development. Plan Colombia also aimed to reduce cultivation, processing, and distribution of illicit drugs by 50% over six years\u2014a goal not met for coca and cocaine,48 but met for opium and heroin, a newer, smaller, less entrenched component of the Colombian drug trade.49 More recent gains have brought down coca yields and estimates of potential production.50 Between FY2000 and FY2012, Congress provided more than $8 billion in support of Plan Colombia and its follow on plans through the U.S. State Department and DOD accounts. The Obama Administration asked for an additional $332 million in State Department funding for these programs in its FY2013 budget request. Aid to the Colombian military and police has been conditioned upon vetting requirements for trainees and meeting human rights conditions. The U.S.-Colombian partnership, initially focused on counternarcotics, shifted in 2002. Because narcotics trafficking and the guerrilla insurgency had become intertwined problems, the U.S. Congress granted the State Department and DOD flexibility to use U.S. counterdrug funds for a unified campaign to fight drug trafficking and terrorist groups. Congress capped the number of U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors that could be stationed in Colombia in support of that effort. President \u00c1lvaro Uribe (2002-2010) aggressively embraced Plan Colombia, and his \"democratic security\" policy successfully pushed back the FARC and ELN insurgencies. Uribe also negotiated an agreement with Colombia's rightwing paramilitaries organized under the AUC that led to the group's disbandment in 2006 after more than 31,000 of its members demobilized. The leftwing insurgencies were further weakened by numerous military, police, and intelligence operations, many of which were carried out with U.S. support. U.S. assistance also led to greater professionalization of the Colombian National Police and armed forces.51President Uribe modified Plan Colombia in 2007, with a strategy to consolidate state presence in marginal areas where violence by illegal armed groups, poverty, and illicit crop cultivation had historically converged. In 2009, this \"whole-of-government\" approach was modified and renamed the National Consolidation Plan (NCP). It is a sequenced process that integrates security, eradication, interdiction, and development. The parallel U.S. program, the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI), supports Colombia's initiative in remote, but strategically important, areas by increasing the presence of civilian state development institutions. The National Consolidation Plan was re-launched by President Juan Manuel Santos after his inauguration in August 2010 to focus on fewer municipalities and to increase the integration of the newly consolidated areas into Colombia's overall development plans. In 2008, the United States began turning over operational and financial responsibility for Plan Colombia programs to the Colombians in a process of nationalization. Over the last four years, as U.S. funding for Plan Colombia has gradually declined, several programs were successfully nationalized, including the Air Bridge Denial Program52 and several police and military aviation operations. The nationalization efforts are not intended to end U.S. assistance, but rather reduce it to pre-Plan Colombia levels adjusted for inflation.53 Most analysts agree that Plan Colombia has significantly improved security conditions in Colombia. Proponents and U.S. officials say that Plan Colombia dramatically reduced violence that once threatened to undermine the state, rolled back the power of the illegally armed groups that are funded by drug profits, and reduced the role of illegal narcotics in the Colombian economy.54 However, some observers, while acknowledging the gains made through manual eradication and advances against the FARC, maintain that aerial spraying has had detrimental effects. Those include the displacement of vulnerable populations, environmental damage, and the dispersal of coca cultivation.55 Critics also argue that the strategy has not rigorously promoted human rights, provided sustainable economic alternatives for drug crop farmers, or reduced the amount of drugs available in the United States. According to the State Department, Colombia still produces more than 95% of the cocaine seized in the United States.56", ""], "id": "43fd315d0f8917c034e42c94e82f454dcc67402b4eb9049bbd2e769e05691b2b", "highlighted_text": "Colombia's portion of the world's coca cultivation declined from 74% in 2000 to 43% in 2009, and continued to decline in 2010 also reduce cultivation, processing, and distribution for opium and heroin More recent gains have brought down coca yields and estimates of potential production Aid to the Colombian military and police has been conditioned upon vetting requirements for trainees and meeting human rights conditions .

He lived up to his reputation. During my one year at the airbase, he inappropriately touched and made indecent comments and sexually explicit jokes to me and my female colleagues. Although I was not physically assaulted, the psychological trauma from these experiences was unbearable. It is never easy to speak of sexual abuse, and I never reported him. Instead, I tried to erase this traumatic episode of my life from my memory - until recently. Last year, the revelations of pervasive sexual harassment and assault in the US film industry, and the consequent rise of the #MeToo movement, brought back these painful memories. Like other women across different industries and countries, I found the courage to speak out. Because armies are male-dominated - across the world men account for more than 90 percent of military staff - and are intrinsically associated with certain notions of masculinity and aggression, they are difficult workplaces for women to navigate. Furthermore, for centuries, armies have used rape as a weapon of war and some continue to do so. In recent years, there has also been growing evidence of the pervasiveness of sexual violence perpetrated by peacekeeping forces and of sexual assault committed within the military ranks across the world. Despite increasing media attention on sexual crimes perpetrated by troops, information and statistics on sexual crimes within the military are still difficult to come by. Few countries around the world publish official data on the subject, and what is publicly available often underrepresents the true extent of the problem. Israel, which mandates military service for both men and women, had 893 cases of sexual assault reported in the last year. The Pentagon estimates that 15,000 members of the US military have been sexually assaulted. In the British military, four in 10 military women are victims of sexual violence. A 2016 survey estimated that 27 percent of women in the Canadian armed forces face sexual abuse during their career. Official reports on sexual violence in the military are even harder to find in developing countries. In my country, Pakistan, there have not been any reports released by the military on sexual crimes committed within its ranks. In countries like India, Peru, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria, there have been only occasional media reports on sexual assault committed by troops or anecdotal evidence published in human rights reports. Across the world, sexual violence is very difficult for women in the military to address. Victims are often blamed for \"provoking\" the sexual abuse with their behaviour or dress. Reporting sexual harassment and assault can mean that the victim is labelled as a person of \"loose morals\" or as \"a liar\". In more conservative settings, virginity and notions of honour make reporting sexual violence even more difficult, as women fear bringing shame to their families and losing their chances of marriage. At times, military women also trivialise sexual harassment to fit into the masculine setting. They may also discourage other women from reporting their experiences. One of the biggest challenges in addressing sexual violence in the army is that military laws and procedures are different from civilian ones. Speaking to the media is prohibited and military institutions can hide behind legal loopholes or national security legislation to dodge accountability for crimes. Sexual violence cases are heard in male-dominated military courts that operate under military law, which makes it difficult for militaries to try abusive people in top leadership positions. Often perpetrators sit in the same chain of command that is supposed to act on the complaint, leaving survivors of sexual violence fearing retaliation if they report. There is a gap in evidence-based studies on the issue, but data from the US military suggest that more than 48 percent of survivors refuse to proceed with trial after reporting sexual violence. Solutions to the problem of sexual violence vary. Countries like Pakistan follow a strict policy of gender segregation to minimise interaction between men and women in the military. This is effective to an extent, given the conservative culture in the country. Norway has taken the exact opposite route of putting men and women together in dorms and this strategy also seems to be working in reducing sexual assault rate. Countries like the US, France, UK, Israel and Canada have made some efforts to reform reporting and response mechanisms for sexual violence crimes to ensure protection for the victims and a higher likelihood for the perpetrators to be held accountable. None of these efforts has been enough, however. To truly address sexual violence within the military, comprehensive changes must be implemented. These include: adapting practices to combat sexual harassment while keeping victims safe; developing action plans to prevent sexual harassment; training troops to report sexual harassment both as victims and as witnesses; creating safe and private channels of reporting sex crimes without fear of retaliation; amending military laws in countries that don't already classify sexual harassment as a specific crime to make it one; publicising the sexual harassment data and actions taken on them; and making provisions for victims to take sexual harassment cases to civil courts."], "id": "db58ea506fc7b3bd11e68ce75fcc66de89f9cb430036b46776817d896bf57f07", "highlighted_text": ".

The risk would be most acute if China or Russia launched non-nuclear attacks against dual-use U.S. C3I assets (including early-warning and communication satellites, as well as ground-based radars and transmitters). Even if conducted exclusively for the purpose of winning (or at least not losing) a conventional war, such non-nuclear attacks could be misinterpreted by Washington as preparations for nuclear use. As a result, Washington might come to believe (wrongly) that it was about to become the victim of a nuclear attack\u2014an effect termed misinterpreted warning. For example, China or Russia might attack U.S. early-warning satellites to enable their regional non-nuclear ballistic missiles (or, perhaps, non-nuclear ICBMs or boost-glide weapons in the future) to penetrate U.S. missile defenses. However, such an attack might be misinterpreted by the United States as an attempt to disable missile defenses designed to protect the homeland against limited nuclear strikes. Even if the United States did not believe that nuclear use by an adversary was imminent, it might still worry that non-nuclear strikes against its dual-use C3I assets could compromise its ability to limit the damage it would suffer if the war turned nuclear at some later point. Such damage-limitation operations, which are an acknowledged part of U.S. nuclear strategy, would probably involve nuclear or non-nuclear attacks on the adversary\u2019s nuclear forces backed up by missile defenses. To have any chance of success, these operations would require very sophisticated C3I capabilities (to target mobile missiles, for example). Attacks on\u2014or even perceived threats to\u2014these C3I assets (many of which are dual use) could lead to concerns in Washington that, unless it took action now, effective damage limitation might be impossible\u2014that is, the damage-limitation window might already have closed\u2014if the war turned nuclear. The United States might respond to either of these concerns in ways that could further escalate the crisis. Washington would probably take steps to protect surviving C3I capabilities. It might, for example, attack anti-satellite weapons that were seen as particularly threatening. Such strikes could prove especially escalatory if they were conducted deeper inside the adversary\u2019s borders than the United States had previously struck. Alternatively, or additionally, Washington might issue explicit or implicit nuclear threats against nuclear use or further attacks on C3I assets. In fact, the 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review even goes so far as to threaten to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks on C3I assets. Risk mitigation will likely prove challenging. China may not want to disentangle its nuclear and non-nuclear forces because doing so might weaken its ability to deter U.S. attacks against the latter and because such disentanglement might prove challenging organizationally for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force (which operates China\u2019s land-based nuclear forces). For Russia, the financial costs associated with disentanglement are likely to be a significant barrier. Moreover, inadvertent escalation is not generally regarded as a serious risk in China or Russia. Unfortunately, the belief that inadvertent escalation is unlikely actually makes it more probable because it leaves political and military leaders less inclined, in peacetime, to take steps that could mitigate the risks and more inclined, in wartime, to interpret ambiguous events in the worst possible light. Although there is more acceptance of the possibility of inadvertent escalation in the United States, there is little evidence that the U.S. government and military have fully factored the risks of entanglement into procurement policies and war planning.

nuclear forces modernization program has been portrayed to the public as an effort to ensure the reliability and safety of warheads in the US nuclear arsenal, rather than to enhance their military capabilities. In reality, however, that program has implemented revolutionary new technologies that will vastly increase the targeting capability of the US ballistic missile arsenal. This increase in capability is astonishing\u2014boosting the overall killing power of existing US ballistic missile forces by a factor of roughly three\u2014and it creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike. Because of improvements in the killing power of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles, those submarines now patrol with more than three times the number of warheads needed to destroy the entire fleet of Russian land-based missiles in their silos. US submarine-based missiles can carry multiple warheads, so hundreds of others, now in storage, could be added to the submarine-based missile force, making it all the more lethal. The revolutionary increase in the lethality of submarine-borne US nuclear forces comes from a \u201csuper-fuze\u201d device that since 2009 has been incorporated into the Navy\u2019s W76-1/Mk4A warhead as part of a decade-long life-extension program. We estimate that all warheads deployed on US ballistic missile submarines now have this fuzing capability. Because the innovations in the super-fuze appear, to the non-technical eye, to be minor, policymakers outside of the US government (and probably inside the government as well) have completely missed its revolutionary impact on military capabilities and its important implications for global security. Before the invention of this new fuzing mechanism, even the most accurate ballistic missile warheads might not detonate close enough to targets hardened against nuclear attack to destroy them. But the new super-fuze is designed to destroy fixed targets by detonating above and around a target in a much more effective way. Warheads that would otherwise overfly a target and land too far away will now, because of the new fuzing system, detonate above the target. FIGURE 1. The deployment of the new MC4700 arming, fuzing, and firing system on the W76-1/Mk4A significantly increases the number of hard target kill-capable warheads on US ballistic missile submarines. The result of this fuzing scheme is a significant increase in the probability that a warhead will explode close enough to destroy the target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead system has itself not improved. As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do. (See Figure 1.) This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has largely been concealed from the general public, has serious implications for strategic stability and perceptions of US nuclear strategy and intentions. Russian planners will almost surely see the advance in fuzing capability as empowering an increasingly feasible US preemptive nuclear strike capability\u2014a capability that would require Russia to undertake countermeasures that would further increase the already dangerously high readiness of Russian nuclear forces. Tense nuclear postures based on worst-case planning assumptions already pose the possibility of a nuclear response to false warning of attack. The new kill capability created by super-fuzing increases the tension and the risk that US or Russian nuclear forces will be used in response to early warning of an attack\u2014even when an attack has not occurred. The increased capability of the US submarine force will likely be seen as even more threatening because Russia does not have a functioning space-based infrared early warning system but relies primarily on ground-based early warning radars to detect a US missile attack. Since these radars cannot see over the horizon, Russia has less than half as much early-warning time as the United States. (The United States has about 30 minutes, Russia 15 minutes or less.) The inability of Russia to globally monitor missile launches from space means that Russian military and political leaders would have no \u201csituational awareness\u201d to help them assess whether an early-warning radar indication of a surprise attack is real or the result of a technical error. The combination of this lack of Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times, high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear situation. When viewed in the alarming context of deteriorating political relations between Russia and the West, and the threats and counter-threats that are now becoming the norm for both sides in this evolving standoff, it may well be that the danger of an accident leading to nuclear war is as high now as it was in periods of peak crisis during the Cold War. How the new accuracy-enhancing fuze works. The significant increase in the ability of the W76-1/Mk4A warhead to destroy hardened targets\u2014including Russian silo-based ICBMs\u2014derives from a simple physical fact: Explosions that occur near and above the ground over a target can be lethal to it. This above-target area is known as a \u201clethal volume\u201d; the detonation of a warhead of appropriate yield in this volume will result in the destruction of the target. The recognition that the killing power of the W76 warhead could be vastly increased by equipping it with a new fuze was discussed in a 1994 alternate warhead study conducted by the Defense and Energy departments. The study calculated the number of warheads that would be needed for the W76 to attack the Russian target base, if START II were implemented. At the time, W76/Mk4 warheads had a fixed height-of-burst fuze (meaning the fuze could not adjust its detonation at an optimal location if it were falling short or long of a target). With those fixed-height fuzes, submarine-launched nuclear missiles were mainly aimed at softer targets such as military bases. But the study found that an enhanced Mk4A reentry-body with a new fuze that provided for an adjustable height-of-burst as it arrives would have significant capabilities against harder targets, compared to warheads with the earlier fuzes. The study assumed that a smaller number of Mk4 nuclear warheads with higher killing power per warhead could cover the Russian target base and be more effective than multiple attacks on targets with less destructive warheads. In other words, an enhanced fuze would allow the United States to reduce the number of warheads on its ballistic missile submarines, but increase the targeting effectiveness of the fleet. Figure 2 illustrates the kill distribution of US submarine-launched nuclear missiles equipped with the earlier, fixed height-of-burst fuzes. The dome-shaped volume outlined in gray shows the lethal volume within which a 100-kiloton nuclear explosion will generate 10,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast pressure on the ground. In other words, if a target on the ground cannot survive a blast of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more, it will be destroyed if a 100-kt nuclear weapon detonates anywhere within that dome-shaped volume. To show the physical relationship of the lethal volume for a particular ground target of interest\u2014in this case a Russian SS-18 ICBM silo\u2014Figure 2 was drawn to scale. Also shown to scale is the approximate spread of warhead trajectories that correspond to a missile that is accurate to 100 meters, a miss distance roughly the same as what is achieved by the Trident II sea-launched ballistic missile. Miss distances are typically characterized in terms of a quantity called the \u201ccircular error probable,\u201d or CEP, which is defined as the radius of a circle around the aim point within which half of the warheads aimed at a target are expected to impact. In the case of a Trident II 100-kt W76-1 ballistic missile warhead, the lethal distance on the ground and the CEP are roughly equal. As a result, roughly half of the warheads equipped with the old, fixed-height fuze system could be expected to fall close enough to detonate on the ground within the lethal range. The new super-fuze for W76-1/Mk4A has a flexible height-of-burst capability that enables it to detonate at any height within the lethal volume over a target. Figure 3 shows how the new fuze vastly increases the chances that the target will be destroyed, even though the arriving warheads have essentially the same ballistic accuracy. The super-fuze is designed to measure its altitude well before it arrives near the target and while it is still outside the atmosphere. This measurement would typically be taken at an altitude of 60 to 80 kilometers, where the effects of atmospheric drag are very small. At this point, the intended trajectory is known to very high precision before the warhead begins to substantially slow from atmospheric drag. If the warhead altitude measured by the super-fuze at that time were exactly equal to the altitude expected for the intended trajectory, the warhead would be exactly on target. But if the altitude were higher than expected, the warhead could be expected to hit beyond the intended aim point. Likewise, if the altitude is lower than that expected, the warhead would likely hit short of the intended aim point. Testing has established the statistical shape and orientation of the expected spread of warhead locations as they fly towards the target. In the case of Trident II, the spread of trajectories around the intended trajectory is so small that the best way to increase the chances of detonating inside the lethal volume is to intentionally shift the aim point slightly beyond the location of the target. (Note that the intended trajectory in Figure 3 is shifted slightly down range.) By shifting the aim point down range by a distance roughly equal to a CEP, warheads that would otherwise fall short or long of the target using the conventional Mk4 fuze instead will detonate\u2014at different heights dictated by the super fuze\u2014within the lethal volume above a target. This shift in the down-range aim point will result in a very high percentage of warheads that overfly the target detonating in the lethal volume. The end result is that with the new Mk4A super-fuze, a substantially higher percentage of launched warheads detonate inside the lethal volume, resulting in a considerable increase in the likelihood that the target is destroyed. The ultimate effect of the super fuze\u2019s flexible burst-height capability is a significantly increased target kill probability of the new W76-1/Mk4A warhead compared with the conventional warhead of the same type. Figure 4 shows the probability that warheads will detonate close enough to destroy the ground-target for both the conventional fuze and the super-fuze. As can be seen from figure 4, the probability of kill using a submarine-launched warhead with the new super-fuze (W76-1/Mk4A) is about 0.86. This 86 percent probability is very close to what could be achieved using three warheads with conventional fuzes to attack the same target. To put it differently: In the case of the 100-kt Trident II warhead, the super fuze triples the killing power of the nuclear force it has been applied to. Many Russian targets are not hardened to 10,000 pounds per square inch blast overpressure. Figure 5 shows the same probability of kill curves for the case of a target that is only hard to 2,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast overpressure, which is the actual case for almost all targets hardened to nuclear attack\u2014ICBMs and supporting command posts, hardened structures at strategic airbases, submarines at pierside or in protected tunnels, hardened command posts at road mobile missile bases and elsewhere, etc. In this case, the super-fuze achieves a probability of kill of about 0.99\u2014or very near certainty. This case also is equivalent to achieving a probability of kill associated with using three warheads with a 0.83 probability to achieve a 0.99 probability of kill. The probability of kills revealed by figures 4 and 5 have enormous security ramifications. The US military assumes that Russian SS-18 and TOPOL missile silos are hardened to withstand a pressure of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more. Since with the new super-fuze, the probability of kill against these silos is near 0.9, the entire force of 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A Trident II warheads now \u201cqualifies\u201d for use against the hardest of Russian silos. This, in turn, means that essentially all of the higher-yield nuclear weapons (such as the W88/Mk5) that were formerly assigned to these Russian hard targets can now be focused on other, more demanding missions, including attacks against deeply-buried underground command facilities. In effect, the significant increase in the killing power of the W76 warhead allows the United States to use its submarine-based weapons more decisively in a wider range of missions than was the case before the introduction of this fuze. The history of the US super-fuze program. The super-fuze is officially known as the arming, fuzing and firing (AF&F) system. It consists of a fuze, an arming subsystem (which includes the radar), a firing subsystem, and a thermal battery that powers the system. The AF&F is located in the tip of the cone-shaped reentry body above the nuclear explosive package itself. The AF&F developed for the new W76-1/Mk4A is known as MC4700 and forms part of the W76 life-extension program intended to extend the service life of the W76\u2014the most numerous warhead in the US stockpile\u2014out to the time period 2040-2050. The new super-fuze uses a technology first deployed on the high-yield W88/Mk5 Trident II warhead. The Navy\u2019s Strategic Systems Program contracted with the Lockheed Missile and Space Corporation in the early 1980s to develop a new fuze that included \u201ca radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze \u2026 that could adjust for trajectory errors and significantly improve the ability to destroy a target. This was an early and sophisticated use of artificial intelligence in a weapon.\u201d It was the radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze\u2014combined with the increased accuracy of the Trident II missile\u2014that gave an SLBM the ability to hold a hardened target at risk. Efforts to incorporate the W88/Mk5 fuze capability into the W76/Mk4 was part of the Energy Department\u2019s Warhead Protection Program in the mid-1990s to permit \u201cMk5 fuzing functionality (including radar-updated path length fuzing, and radar proximity fuzing) as an option to replacement of the much smaller Mk4 AF&F,\u201d according to the partially declassified 1996 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (emphasis added). Apart from the inherent drive to improve military capabilities whenever possible, the motivation for increasing the target kill capability of the submarine-borne W76 was that the Air Force\u2019s hard-target killer, the MX Peacekeeper ICBM, was scheduled to be retired under the START II treaty. The Navy only had 400 W88 hard-target kill warheads, so a decision was made to add the capability to the W76. In an article in April 1997, Strategic Systems Program director Rear Adm. George P. Nanos publicly explained that \u201cjust by changing the fuze in the Mk4 reentry body, you get a significant improvement. The Mk4, with a modified fuze and Trident II accuracy, can meet the original D5 [submarine-borne missile] hard target requirement,\u201d . Later that same year, the Energy Department\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan formally described the objective of the fuze modernization program \u201cto enable W76 to take advantage of [the] higher accuracy of [the] D5 missile.\u201d By 1998, the fuze modernization effort became a formal project, with five SLBM flight tests planned for 2001-2008. Full-scale production of the super-fuze equipped W76-1/Mk4A began in September 2008, with the first warhead delivered to the Navy in February 2009. By the end of 2016, roughly 1,200 of an estimated 1,600 planned W76-1/Mk4As had been produced, of which about 506 are currently deployed on ballistic missile submarines. The implications. The newly created capability to destroy Russian silo-based nuclear forces with 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A warheads\u2014the most numerous in the US stockpile\u2014vastly expands the nuclear warfighting capabilities of US nuclear forces. Since only part of the W76 force would be needed to eliminate Russia\u2019s silo-based ICBMs, the United States will be left with an enormous number of higher-yield warheads that would then be available to be reprogrammed for other missions. Approximately 890 warheads are deployed on US ballistic missile submarines (506 W76-1/Mk4A and 384 W88/Mk5). Assuming that the 506 deployed W76-1s equipped with the super-fuze were used against Russian silo-based ICBMs, essentially all 136 Russian silo-based ICBMs could be potentially eliminated by attacking each silo with two W76-1 warheads\u2014a total of 272 warheads. This would consume only 54 percent of the deployed W76-1 warheads, leaving roughly 234 of the 500 warheads free to be targeted on yet other installations. And hundreds of additional submarine warheads are in storage for increasing the missile warhead loading if so ordered. The Trident II missiles that are deployed today carry an average of four to five W76-1 warheads each. However, each missile could carry eight such warheads if the US were to suddenly decide to carry a maximum load of W76 warheads on its deployed Trident II ballistic missiles. And the missile was tested with up to 12 warheads. Essentially all the 384 W88 \u201cheavy\u201d Trident II warheads, with yields of 455 kt, would also be available for use against deeply-buried targets. In addition, about 400 Minuteman III warheads, with yields of about 300 kt, could be used to target hardened Russian targets. In all, the entire Russian silo-based forces could potentially be destroyed while leaving the US with 79 percent of its ballistic missile warheads unused. Even after Russia\u2019s silo-based missiles were attacked, the US nuclear firepower remaining would be staggering\u2014and certainly of concern to Russia or any other country worried about a US first strike. Because of the new kill capabilities of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the United States would be able to target huge portions of its nuclear force against non-hardened targets, the destruction of which would be crucial to a \u201csuccessful\u201d first strike. One such mission would likely involve the destruction of road-mobile ICBMs that had left their garrisons to hide in Russia\u2019s vast forests in anticipation of attack. The garrisons and their support facilities would probably be destroyed quickly, and some of the dispersed road-mobile launchers would also be quickly destroyed as they were in the process of dispersing. To destroy or expose the remaining launchers, United States planners would have the nuclear forces needed to undertake truly scorched-earth tactics: Just 125 US Minuteman III warheads could set fire to some 8,000 square miles of forest area where the road-mobile missiles are most likely to be deployed. This would be the equivalent of a circular area with a diameter of 100 miles. Such an attack would be potentially aimed at destroying all road-mobile launchers either as they disperse or after they have taken up position some short distance from roads that give them access to forested areas. Many of the nearly 300 remaining deployed W76 warheads could be used to attack all command posts associated with Russian ICBMs. A very small number of Russia\u2019s major leadership command posts are deeply buried, to protect them from direct destruction by nuclear attack. The US military would likely reserve the highest-yield warheads for those targets. Figure 7 below shows an example of a structure that is roughly the size of the US Capitol building that is postulated to have rooms and tunnels as deep as 800 feet or more. Shelters that have rooms and tunnels at even greater depths could be sealed by using multiple nuclear warheads to crater every location where an entrance or exit might conceivably have been built."],

The sphere the President of Russia is referring to is artificial intelligence (AI) and his comments should give you a moment of pause. Addressing students at the beginning of our Labor Day weekend, Putin remarked \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,\u201d adding, \u201cIt comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict.\u201d For once, I find myself in agreement with the President of Russia, but just this once. Artificial Intelligence offers incredible promise and peril. Nowhere is this clearer than in the realm of national security. Today un-crewed systems are a fact of modern warfare. Nearly every country is adopting systems where personnel are far removed from the conflict and wage war by remote control. AI  to sever that ground connection. Imagine a fully autonomous Predator or Reaper drone. Managed by an AI system, the drone could identify targets, determine their legitimacy, and conduct a strike all without human intervention. Indeed, the Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom issued a press  in September that the country \u201cdoes not possess fully autonomous weapon systems and has no intention of developing them,\u201d and that its weapons systems \u201cwill always be under control as an absolute guarantee of human oversight and authority and accountability.\u201d Let\u2019s think smaller. Imagine a tiny insect-sized drone loaded with explosive. Guided by a , it could hunt down a specific target \u2014 a politician, a general, or an opposition figure \u2014 determine when to strike, how to strike, and if to strike based on its own learning. Howard Hughes Medical Center  attached a backpack to a genetically modified dragonfly and flew it remotely. These examples are, however, where humans are involved and largely control the left and right limits of AI. Yet, there are examples of AI purposely and independently going beyond programed parameters. Rogue algorithms led to a  of the British Pound. In 2016, in-game AIs created super AIs weapons and  human players, and AIs have  their own languages that were indecipherable to humans. AIs proved more effective than their human counterparts in producing and catching users in spear phishing programs. Not only did the AIs create more content, they successfully  more users with their deception. While seemingly simple and low stakes in nature, extrapolate these scenarios into more significant and risky areas and the consequences become much greater. Cybersecurity is no different. Today we are focused on the hackers, trolls, and cyber criminals (officially sanctioned and otherwise) who seek to penetrate our networks, steal our intellectual property, and leave behind malicious code for activation in the event of a conflict. Replace the individual with an AI and imagine how fast hacking takes place; networks against networks, at machine speed all without a human in the loop. Sound far-fetched? It\u2019s not. In 2016, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency held an AI on AI capture the flag contest called the  at the DEF CON event. AI networks against AI networks. In August of this year the founders of 116 AI and robotics companies signed a letter petitioning the United Nations  lethal autonomous systems. Signatories to this letter included Google DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and Elon Musk who, in response to Putin\u2019s quote , \u201cCompetition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo (sic)\u201d. AI is not some far off future challenge. It is a challenge today and one with which we must grapple. I am in favor of fielding any system that enhances our national security, but we must have an open and honest conversation about the implications of AI, the consequences of which we do not, and may not, fully understand. This is not a new type of bullet or missile. This is a potentially fully autonomous system that even with human oversight and guidance will make its own decisions on the battlefield and in cyberspace. How can we ensure that the system does not escape our control? How can we prevent such systems from falling into the hands of terrorists or insurgents? Who controls the source code? How and can we build in so-called impenetrable kill switches? AI and AI-like systems are slowly being introduced into our arsenal. Our adversaries, China, Russia, and others are also introducing AI systems into their arsenals as well. Implementation is happening faster than our ability to fully comprehend the consequences. Putin\u2019s new call spells out a new arms race. Rushing to AI weapon systems without guiding principles is a dangerous.

Designed to deter North Korea from launching a war while the United States was involved in fighting against Iran or Iraq (or vice versa,) the idea helped give form to the Department of Defense\u2019s procurement, logistical and basing strategies in the post\u2013Cold War, when the United States no longer needed to face down the Soviet threat. The United States backed away from the doctrine because of changes in the international system, including the rising power of China and the proliferation of highly effective terrorist networks. But what if the United States had to fight two wars today, and not against states like North Korea and Iran? What if China and Russia sufficiently coordinated with one another to engage in simultaneous hostilities in the Pacific and in Europe? Political Coordination Could Beijing and Moscow coordinate a pair of crises that would drive two separate U.S. military responses? Maybe, but probably not. Each country has its own goals, and works on its own timeline. More likely, one of the two would opportunistically take advantage of an existing crisis to further its regional claims. For example, Moscow might well decide to push the Baltic States if the United States became involved in a major skirmish in the South China Sea. In any case, the war would start on the initiative of either Moscow or Beijing. The United States enjoys the benefits of the status quo in both areas, and generally (at least where great powers are concerned) prefers to use diplomatic and economic means to pursue its political ends. While the U.S. might create the conditions for war, Russia or China would pull the trigger. Flexibility On the upside, only some of the requirements for fighting in Europe and the Pacific overlap. As was the case in World War II, the U.S. Army would bear the brunt of defending Europe, while the Navy would concentrate on the Pacific. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would play a supporting role in both theaters. Russia lacks the ability to fight NATO in the North Atlantic, and probably has no political interest in trying. This means that while the United States and its NATO allies can allocate some resources to threatening Russia\u2019s maritime space (and providing insurance against a Russian naval sortie,) the U.S. Navy (USN) can concentrate its forces in the Pacific. Depending on the length of the conflict and the degree of warning provided, the United States could transport considerable U.S. Army assets to Europe to assist with any serious fighting. The bulk of American carriers, submarines and surface vessels would concentrate in the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, fighting directly against China\u2019s A2/AD system and sitting astride China\u2019s maritime transit lanes. Long range aviation, including stealth bombers and similar assets, would operate in both theaters as needed. The U.S. military would be under strong pressure to deliver decisive victory in at least one theater as quickly as possible. This might push the United States to lean heavily in one direction with air, space and cyber assets, hoping to achieve a strategic and political victory that would allow the remainder of its weight to shift to the other theater. Given the strength of U.S. allies in Europe, the United States might initially focus on the conflict in the Pacific. Alliance Structure U.S. alliance structure in the Pacific differs dramatically from that of Europe. Notwithstanding concern over the commitment of specific U.S. allies in Europe, the United States has no reason to fight Russia apart from maintaining the integrity of the NATO alliance. If the United States fights, then Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom will follow. In most conventional scenarios, even the European allies alone would give NATO a tremendous medium term advantage over the Russians; Russia might take parts of the Baltics, but it would suffer heavily under NATO airpower, and likely couldn\u2019t hold stolen territory for long. In this context, the USN and USAF would largely play support and coordinative roles, giving the NATO allies the advantage they needed to soundly defeat the Russians. The U.S. nuclear force would provide insurance against a Russian decision to employ tactical or strategic nuclear weapons. The United States faces more difficult problems in the Pacific. Japan or India might have an interest in the South China Sea, but this hardly guarantees their participation in a war (or even the degree of benevolence of their neutrality.) The alliance structure of any given conflict would depend on the particulars of that conflict; any of the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or Taiwan could become China\u2019s primary target. The rest, U.S. pressure aside, might well prefer to sit on the sidelines. This would put extra pressure on the United States to establish dominance in the Western Pacific with its own assets.

With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!\" The President might need reminding that the top three oil-producing states in the country -- Texas, North Dakota, and Alaska -- all voted for him. Of the Top 25 oil-producing states, only California, New Mexico, Colorado, and Illinois (at No. 16) voted against him. Oil country is Trump country, and I would imagine he will hear from some constituents that they like high oil prices. Rising oil prices have enabled U.S. shale oil production to rebound from the decline it suffered in 2016. Further, it isn't true that there is still record amounts of oil \"all over the place.\" A couple of years ago, global inventories were indeed at record highs. There was also a tremendous amount of oil in floating storage -- the \"fully loaded ships at sea.\" That's no longer the case. The production cuts from OPEC have reduced crude oil inventories back into a normal range. This can be seen in the most recent Oil Market Report from the International Energy Agency: Once upon a time, when the U.S. imported 10 million barrels per day of crude oil, high oil prices were a serious drag on the U.S. economy. But with U.S. net exports plummeting toward zero, this situation is changing.

A significant rise in global temperatures, combined with more severe weather conditions, more frequent floods and droughts, are bringing a paradigm shift to the way we think about our relationship with the planet. For the first time in over 150 years policy makers are thinking seriously about decreasing dependency on fossil fuels and looking for alternatives that may be more expensive in the short and medium terms, but ultimately more sustainable. 7 All of this has happened at the same time as two other, related phenomena. The first is that the global population is reaching new highs and by 2040\u201050 will total over 9 billion people. Experts predict that 85% of the world\u2019s population will be located in the developing world, which will mean a rapidly growing demand for goods and for energy. Both of these factors will result in a need to increase energy efficiency as well as find new sources of energy. What\u2019s more, this massive jump in population will coincide not only with climate change but also with increasingly difficult conditions for hydrocarbons exploration and production. As most of the world\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d oil has already been discovered, oil companies and nation states are turning to alternatives such a non\u2010conventional oil reserves (tar sands, complex fields) and reserves that in the past would have been considered unrecoverable, such as in very deep ocean waters. Furthermore, political conditions in many of the world\u2019s oil rich regions are uncertain, unstable and often unfriendly to private oil companies and to the countries of the West. Climate change and natural disasters The urgency of finding alternatives to fossil fuels has been confirmed in recent years by mounting scientific evidence that we are undergoing a noticeable anthropogenic shift in the world\u2019s weather and temperature. Not only are a range of indicators showing that the planet is warming, but the retreat of the polar ice caps, the melting of glaciers, and most importantly in the short term extreme weather conditions and increased incidence of natural disasters have highlighted the consequences of maintaining the status quo in our patterns of energy consumption and industrial development. It is estimated that we have experienced a 1 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures over the past 100 years and that by the end of the current century global temperatures may have risen by as much 7 or 8 degrees. Even with the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that is contemplated by the most ambitious mitigation strategies, global temperatures may rise by as much as 6%. This would have a dramatic and disastrous impact on both developed and developing nations and will threaten the existence of both humans and animal and plant species. Though the connection between man\u2010made greenhouse gases and global warming was denied for many years by industry and governments alike, it has now been accepted that something must be done to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Given that 86% of all global energy comes from fossil fuels, and that these fossil fuels produce 27,000,000,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually, finding alternative sources of energy is a crucial component of climate change mitigation strategies", ""], "id": "36909691bbf6d58acf57b91d2d21046385653afd051dbfb132b79e4c70279113", "highlighted_text": "climate change crisis caused by fossil fuel urgency of finding alternatives to fossil fuels has been confirmed in recent years by mounting scientific evidence anthropogenic shift in the world\u2019s temperature global temperatures may rise by as much as 6%. disastrous impact on nations threaten the existence of humans species finding alternative sources of energy is a crucial component of climate change mitigation", "highlights": [[2, 57, 88], [2, 104, 115], [2, 1749, 1863], [2, 1900, 1919], [2, 1920, 1934], [2, 1947, 1958], [2, 2671, 2717], [2, 2749, 2769], [2, 2800, 2807], [2, 2817, 2825], [2, 2826, 2842], [2, 2848, 2854], [2, 2876, 2883], [2, 3289, 3331], [2, 3332, 3349], [2, 3350, 3378]], "underlines": [[2, 35, 56], [2, 57, 88], [2, 89, 103], [2, 104, 115], [2, 116, 139], [2, 142, 264], [2, 980, 1052], [2, 1235, 1529], [2, 1543, 1707], [2, 1749, 1863], [2, 1864, 1899], [2, 1900, 1919], [2, 1920, 1934], [2, 1935, 1946], [2, 1947, 1958], [2, 1975, 2122], [2, 2123, 2128], [2, 2129, 2133], [2, 2134, 2205], [2, 2357, 2378], [2, 2379, 2387], [2, 2388, 2552], [2, 2671, 2717], [2, 2736, 2748], [2, 2749, 2769], [2, 2770, 2799], [2, 2800, 2807], [2, 2808, 2816], [2, 2817, 2825], [2, 2826, 2842], [2, 2843, 2847], [2, 2848, 2854], [2, 2855, 2875], [2, 2876, 2883], [2, 2885, 3144], [2, 3287, 3288], [2, 3289, 3331], [2, 3332, 3349], [2, 3350, 3378], [2, 3379, 3389]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 7]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2010-01-01"}, {"tag": "Low oil prices lead to Venezuelan instability", "cite": "Hargreaves 13 \u2014 Steve Hargreaves, reporter for CNN, 7/18/13, CNN Money, \u201cFalling oil prices could spark global turmoil\u201d  / MM", "body": ["The pain won't be evenly spread.

But the crisis has a broader significance: It shows that Latin America has again become an arena in which rival great powers struggle for influence and advantage. As the U.S. faces surging geopolitical rivalry around the world, its position is also coming under pressure in its own backyard. The region has been the focus of global competition before, of course, from the Spanish-Portuguese rivalry of the 15th and 16th centuries to the Cold War between Washington and Moscow. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Latin America seemed \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 to have become a geopolitics-free zone. The retreat and disintegration of the Soviet Union left the U.S. with no challenger for predominant regional influence. Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba turned inward, consumed by a profound economic crisis. As countries democratized and embraced free markets, the region became essentially unipolar in an ideological sense, as well. By the early 2000s, however, the climate was shifting. First came a new generation of leaders who viewed neoliberal economics as the source of the region\u2019s persistent poverty and inequality. Governments led by the likes of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador coupled populist political appeals and economic programs with a penchant for illiberalism and, in some cases, outright authoritarianism. They challenged the U.S. diplomatically and rhetorically, while establishing close ties with Cuba. This created a bloc of regional actors that opposed American power \u2014 just as outside actors were beginning to assert, or reassert, their own influence in the region. As China\u2019s economy has boomed over the last two decades, its presence in Latin America has grown as well. Chinese trade and investment has surged nearly everywhere, not just countries run by radical populists. Chinese commerce and loans have provided a lifeline to illiberal rulers such as Chavez and now Nicolas Maduro by reducing their vulnerability to U.S. and Western pressure. Chinese military engagement followed, creating fears that Beijing may be trying to establish a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere. Although aspects of China\u2019s relationship with Latin American countries remain controversial \u2014 some Chinese infrastructure projects have been criticized because they often employ Chinese rather than Latin American workers, for instance \u2014 Beijing has undoubtedly become a player in the Western Hemisphere. Russia has provided economic and diplomatic support to Chavez, Maduro and other autocratic rulers such as Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega. It has sold jets, tanks and other weapons to populist governments, and resumed providing military technology and oil to Cuba. Much to the concern of the U.S. government, the Kremlin has also been working to establish a significant intelligence presence in Nicaragua. As the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace observes, \u201cMoscow\u2019s approach to Latin America today echoes Soviet outreach in the 1960s through 1980s.\u201d Russian and Chinese relations with Latin American countries are often described as simply transactional, and it is true that both Moscow and Beijing can drive hard bargains for their support. One price of Russia\u2019s continued backing of the Maduro regime has been a significant ownership stake in the Venezuelan oil industry. China, too, has seen Venezuela as an energy source, and its economic growth would have driven enhanced involvement in Latin America even in the absence of any geopolitical design. But for both countries, that involvement also has a deeply competitive logic. Reaching into Latin America is a way of keeping the U.S. off-balance by exerting influence in Washington\u2019s \u201cnear abroad.\u201d It helps augment Beijing\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s global influence and stature at a time of intensifying rivalry with Washington. Finally, supporting autocratic regimes such as those in Caracas and Managua \u2014 whether quietly, as in China\u2019s case, or more vocally, as in Russia\u2019s \u2014 is a way of making sure that the world remains ideologically safe for authoritarianism in Beijing and Moscow, as well. All this constitutes the backdrop to the Venezuelan crisis. The growth of Russian and Chinese influence in Latin America broadly, and Venezuela specifically, is a key reason the Trump administration has so uncharacteristically taken up the banner of human rights and democracy. By imposing harsh economic sanctions, calling for the military to desert Maduro, and backing the political opposition led by Juan Guiado, the Trump administration is seeking to deprive Moscow, Beijing and Havana of a critical partner in Latin America. And while Russia and China have responded very differently to this crisis, both are working, in their own ways, to protect that partner. The Chinese government has registered its opposition to the international campaign against Maduro\u2019s government; it has continued to recognize his embattled government even as dozens of democratic countries have thrown their support behind Guiado. Russia has been far more assertive, denouncing Washington for trying to \u201cengineer a coup d\u2019etat,\u201d in the words of its United Nations representative. It has warned against American military intervention, and symbolically dispatched two nuclear-capable strategic bombers to Venezuela. More concretely, Moscow has reportedly dispatched 400 mercenaries to reinforce Maduro\u2019s praetorian guard and pledged additional economic support. There is thus a certain Cold War feel to the current crisis, with the U.S. and its rivals lining up on opposite sides of a conflict over who should rule a key Latin American country. To be sure, there is an element of bluff in Moscow\u2019s position. It can project only very limited military power into Venezuela or any other part of Latin America. Still, by providing Maduro with moral and material support that he would otherwise lack, both Russia and China are making the current crisis more difficult to resolve. Is the U.S. ready for this new environment where local crises and global tensions once again interact in challenging ways? The Trump administration deserves some credit here. It has spoken candidly about the dangers Chinese and Russian influence present to both Latin America and the U.S. It has also worked closely with other Latin American governments \u2014 including Brazil\u2019s new and admittedly problematic president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 to coordinate the diplomatic pressure campaign against Maduro. There are also less helpful tendencies in U.S. policy. Trump\u2019s earlier hostility to NAFTA gave Mexico and other Latin American countries incentive to diversify their economic relations, with China a willing target. The administration has warned about the threats posed by Chinese investment in dire tones, without making clear where else Latin American countries should turn for resources. Then there are the president\u2019s offensive comments toward people of Hispanic descent, which have done little to endear him to Latin American audiences. In a 2015 Pew Research Center poll, a median of 66 percent of Latin Americans from seven different countries viewed the U.S. positively. Under Donald Trump, the number has fallen to 47 percent. Finally, developing a comprehensive strategy for dealing with Chinese and Russian influence will require consistent policies and cultivating key relationships \u2014 talents this administration has rarely displayed. Washington is increasingly waking up to the new struggle for advantage in Latin America.

The nation with the third-biggest nuclear stockpile, France, has \u201conly\u201d 300 or so (Kristensen and Norris 2017). If Russia and the United States fought an all-out nuclear war, it would upend human civilization. So it makes sense to begin any assessment of prospects for nuclear arms control and reduction measures at the bilateral level. But Washington and Moscow\u2019s bilateral process of gradual nuclear disarmament has been in serious disarray since 2014. With the two sides at loggerheads over Crimea, Ukraine more broadly, and Syria, the bilateral atmosphere has deteriorated badly. Indeed, the danger of military escalation between Washington and Moscow has increased significantly. US and Russian armed forces are operating in close proximity around Russia\u2019s Western border, especially in the Baltic region. The same is true in Syria \u2013 where, after the recent US airstrike against Syrian forces, Russia suspended an agreement (Filipov and Gearan 2017) that the two sides had reached regarding limited communications measures to reduce the risk of unintentional conflict. In Europe, risk reduction measures are still insufficient \u2013 even as the number of close military encounters has been disturbingly high (Task Force on Cooperation in Greater Europe 2015). Moreover, Washington and Moscow have expressed clearly divergent nuclear priorities over the last several years. Under the Obama administration, the United States proposed that each side cut its strategic arsenal by one-third \u2013 and bring tactical weapons into the bargain too. Moscow rebuffed this offer, calling instead for limits on US missile defense. It remains to be seen how the Trump administration will position itself, but it is safe to say that further bilateral nuclear reductions seem unlikely in the foreseeable future. Neither side can have an interest in allowing a conventional conflict to escalate to the nuclear level, but such escalation is nonetheless possible. In the last several years, both Moscow and Washington have engaged in some quite alarming rhetoric \u2013 as demonstrated by the Russian ambassador\u2019s language, quoted earlier, regarding Denmark. In the United States, when then\u2013 presidential candidate Donald Trump was asked whether he would consider using nuclear weapons in parts of Europe, he gave an extremely vague answer \u2013 saying that \u201cEurope is a big place\u201d and alluding to the possibility of \u201cvery deep, very difficult, very horrible negotiation[s]\u201d (Legum 2016). Such statements imply that a nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia is a possibility. The two sides\u2019 nuclear strategy and posture increase the risk of war. Russia, concerned about its inferiority in conventional arms, began in 2000 to maintain a national security strategy that explicitly contemplated using nuclear weapons if Russia were on the losing side in a conventional military confrontation (Russian Federation 2000). The wording was watered down somewhat in documents released in 2010 and 2014, but the nuclear option was still on the table for Moscow in case of \u201ca military conflict involving the utilization of conventional means of attack\u201d that might imperil \u201cthe very existence of the state\u201d (Colby 2016). This element of Russian nuclear doctrine is dangerously ambiguous \u2013 though, encouragingly, the declassified version of the 2015 national security strategy does not allude to such scenarios. Meanwhile, both sides keep their strategic nuclear systems on hair-trigger alert, which leaves leaders very little time to make \u201crational\u201d decisions about using nuclear weapons during a crisis. This problem is compounded by the questionable reliability of early warning systems. Early warning depends on the reliable performance of satellites, radar systems, communications systems, and computers \u2013 but nuclear history is full of false alarms and misinterpretations (Lewis, et al. 2014). Between 1977 and 1984 there were more than 1,100 \u201cmoderately serious\u201d false alarms in the United States alone (Cirincione 2013). All in all, the current climate is not conducive to further bilateral nuclear reductions.

But not in Russia. As the unrest in the Middle East bites into supplies, prices for crude approached $105 a barrel this week. That's helping drive windfall profits that are enabling the world's biggest energy exporter to finally emerge from recession triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008. But while that's good news for Russia's economy, Kremlin critics say rising energy prices are again shoring up the country's authoritarian government -- and that's bad for politics. Energy Savior Russia is using the crises in the Middle East and Japan to burnish its image as the world's energy superpower. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin -- who has predicted that Russia's GDP will equal its precrisis level by next year -- exchanged his usually stern demeanor for an uncharacteristically friendly manner last week and promised to help Japan, where the nuclear crisis has forced electricity blackouts. He predicted the effects of the earthquake and tsunami to energy supplies there will be long-term.  \"In that regard, we have to think of accelerating our plans to develop hydrocarbon-extraction projects -- particularly gas extraction -- in the Far East,\" he said. Putin offered to pump more gas to Europe by pipeline, freeing shipments of liquefied natural gas for Japan. He also proposed laying an electricity cable to Japan and offered Japanese companies stakes in Siberian gas fields. Moscow has issued more offers since, including encouragement for Japanese companies to invest in Russia's coal industry. But some analysts are warning Russia's heightened focus on its global energy role is eroding any -- already distant -- hopes the government would enact economic reform. The Kremlin vowed to diversify the country's economy after plummeting oil prices dealt the economy a body blow during the global financial crisis. Anti-Westernism Rising Political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky says the latest events in the Middle East are instead helping speed a return to Russia's precrisis situation, when peak oil prices flooded the country with cash. \"We're returning to the golden era of 2006 and 2007, with official propaganda slogans extolling a 'great energy power,'\" Piontkovsky says. \"It's very good for a very limited group of people for a very short time period, but certainly it's very bad for the country.\" Piontkovsky says the developments are reinforcing the \"general mentality\" of Russia's leaders, reflected in a return to the kind of strident anti-Western rhetoric that was especially loud during the precrisis oil boom. He points to President Dmitry Medvedev's comments this month in which he blamed Western countries for prompting the Middle East unrest, adding that \"they have prepared such a scenario for us.\" But it's Putin who's seen as Russia's supreme leader. He lashed out on March 22 in his strongest anti-Western comments in years, condemning the UN Security Council for authorizing force against Libya. He said last week's resolution enabled Western countries to take action against a sovereign state \"under the guise of protecting the civilian population.\" \"It actually resembles medieval calls for crusades when someone called on others to go to a certain place and liberate it,\" Putin said. Redefining Foreign Policy But the atmosphere in Moscow is more nuanced then the rhetoric suggests. Medvedev rejected Putin's comments, calling them \"unacceptable.\" And despite Putin's displeasure, Russia declined to veto the resolution when it came to a vote last week, instead choosing to abstain. Fyodr Lukyanov, editor of the journal \"Russia in Global Affairs,\" sees that decision as more significant than the tough talk. \"It's not typical,\" he says. \"Russia used to take stands for or against, particularly when it comes to issues such as intervention in other countries.\" He says foreign policy isn't being driven by rising oil prices. \"It's about the gradual refocusing of Russian interests and redefining of Russian foreign-policy identity from a global one to a more regional one.\" That change, he says, reflects a \"much more rational calculation of priorities.\" \"It doesn't mean Russia is more pro-Western,\" Lukyanov says. \"Russia is becoming less global, which means that, for example, the idea to challenge Washington everywhere and over everything isn't relevant anymore.\" Russia's Resources Card Boosting energy exports is among the priorities, as Putin's latest salesmanship reflects. But maintaining current levels won't be as easy as it may appear. Economist Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution says the key question for Russia's future economic success will be how it responds to demand in resource-hungry China. Whatever the rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, he says, Russia has little chance of competing in any other sector. \"You can dream all you want about diversification and blame Putin or whoever for not diversifying or praise them because they want to diversify,\" Gaddy says, \"but it doesn\u2019t make very much sense. Russia's comparative, competitive advantage is not in anything except resources, so the smart thing to do is play that card.\" For now, Gaddy sees few long-term effects for Russia from the Middle East unrest, saying oil prices were predicted to rise to $105 to $108 this year even before it began, while commodity prices are expected to continue rising for the foreseeable future. That's depressing news for Putin's critics. Many believe the prime minister plans to return to the presidency in an election next year, and -- if elected again -- he could remain in office for the next 12 years.

It was the economic stagnation of the former Soviet Union that led to its political downfall. Similarly, Medvedev and Putin, both intimately acquainted with their nation's history, are unquestionably alarmed at the prospect that Russia's economic crisis will endanger the nation's political stability, achieved at great cost after years of chaos following the demise of the Soviet Union. Already, strikes and protests are occurring among rank and file workers facing unemployment or non-payment of their salaries. Recent polling demonstrates that the once supreme popularity ratings of Putin and Medvedev are eroding rapidly. Beyond the political elites are the financial oligarchs, who have been forced to deleverage, even unloading their yachts and executive jets in a desperate attempt to raise cash. Should the Russian economy deteriorate to the point where economic collapse is not out of the question, the impact will go far beyond the obvious accelerant such an outcome would be for the Global Economic Crisis. There is a geopolitical dimension that is even more relevant then the economic context. Despite its economic vulnerabilities and perceived decline from superpower status, Russia remains one of only two nations on earth with a nuclear arsenal of sufficient scope and capability to destroy the world as we know it. For that reason, it is not only President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin who will be lying awake at nights over the prospect that a national economic crisis can transform itself into a virulent and destabilizing social and political upheaval. It just may be possible that U.S. President Barack Obama's national security team has already briefed him about the consequences of a major economic meltdown in Russia for the peace of the world. After all, the most recent national intelligence estimates put out by the U.S. intelligence community have already concluded that the Global Economic Crisis represents the greatest national security threat to the United States, due to its facilitating political instability in the world. During the years Boris Yeltsin ruled Russia, security forces responsible for guarding the nation's nuclear arsenal went without pay for months at a time, leading to fears that desperate personnel would illicitly sell nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations.

Critical to this unique standing has been Saudi maintenance of a cushion of \"spare capacity,\" now estimated at about two million barrels a day. For much of the recent period, the kingdom has refrained from tapping into all or most of its spare capacity.  Within oil industry circles in places like Houston, the Saudi power has also carried a somewhat ominous connotation. Faced with growing production from the U.K., Mexico and other non-OPEC countries in the mid-1980s, Saudi Arabia flooded the market in an effort to drive out high-cost production and reassert its dominant market share.  The 1986 oil price crash ushered in more than 15 years of mostly-lower crude prices, instilling a memory of economic hardship on the western oil industry that continues to be reflected in Big Oil's caution during these heady times. The shift to lower petroleum prices also impeded the development of renewable energy for about two decades.  In his book, The Prize, Daniel Yergin compared the Saudi tactic in the 1980s to power plays by John Rockefeller and other heavyweights in the history of oil who have used a \"good sweating\" to drive out competitors.  \"No one is worrying about over-supply,\" Yergin said in an interview. Instead, the market is preoccupied with meeting growth in China, India and other fast-developing economies.  \"What (the Saudis) have discovered is that the tolerance level in consumers is higher than they thought,\" said Thomas Lippman, an adjunct scholar at the  Middle East Institute, a Washington research institute.  Given the specter of higher demand in Asia and the increased cost of bringing on new oil production, many analysts believe the long-term price of oil is in the $45-$60 a barrel range. Recent comments by Naimi suggest the Saudi official sees an even higher floor than that.  \"A line has been drawn now below which prices will not fall,\" Naimi said in March in an interview with PetroStrategies, a French energy publication. Citing the marginal costs of biofuels and Canadian tar-sands, Naimi defined the floor as \"probably between $60 or $70.\"  Naimi in April said Saudi Arabia was putting off a plan to expand oil capacity beyond 12.5 million barrels because of concerns about demand growth. \"Unless we see really genuine demand, we have to pause right now and see what happens,\" Naimi told Petroleum Argus.  Some energy analysts say the Saudi move suggested a more sober outlook on oil prices. \"If they see a lot of risk on the demand side then you could see very low prices and potentially a lot of underutilized capacity down the road,\" said Ken Medlock, a fellow at Rice's Baker Institute.

The process of consolidation of the regime has been long and tortuous, and probably is not yet concluded; the central government lacks the resources to impose an effective control over the whole national territory and order in the peripheral region is maintained through informal deals with local strongmen and powerbrokers. Drug mafias, as we have seen, are powerful political-economic actors, and president Rahmon cannot take the risk of starting an open conflict against them. Together with these interdependencies between the central regime and peripheral strongman, the poor capacities of Tajik law-enforcement agencies is another key factor which has contributed to the expansion of the drug business in post-conflict Tajikistan. The reorganization of the security sector has been an extremely difficult task for all post-Soviet states. After 1991 their rulers had to nationalize law-enforcement agencies and army structures, and to take control of borders, which during Soviet times were mere administrative divisions among units of the same state. In Tajikistan, the civil war complicated and slowed down these processes. Inadequate resources have been allocated for the reform and renovation of the security sector, and as a result law-enforcement agencies and border troops lack the equipment and skills to tackle the activities of criminal groups. In addition, their staff is underpaid, so that it is easy for mafias to bribe officials. Five different bodies carry out counter-narcotics activities in Tajikistan: the Ministry of Interior, the National Security Committee (Security Services), the Customs department of the 132 F. De Danieli Ministry for State Revenues and Taxation, the Drug Control Agency (DCA), and the State Border Protection Committee (the border troops). Most of these agencies are severely underfunded. Their equipment is obsolete, and the personnel lack training in modern interdiction techniques. As I was told by an official of the Drug Control Agency, \u2018not only do police and militaries not have at their disposal specialized equipment such as night-viewers, passport readers, x-ray devices, but they are also running short of basic equipment such as vehicles, gasoline or winter clothes\u2019.12 At the same time, collaboration and coordination between different law-enforcement agencies is very weak, as competences are not clearly defined, and specific interests of single agencies often prevail over national priorities.13 Lack of coordination between central headquarters and peripheral outposts is another major problem.14 Corruption also seriously hinders the effectiveness of counter-narcotics measures. On the one hand top politicians are colluding with criminal networks, while on the other soldiers and policemen earn very low salaries and thus they have every incentive to turn a blind eye on criminal activities in exchange for a reward. A number of drug scandals which involved high-profile figures of the regime suggest that there are close connections between criminal and institutional actors in Tajikistan. The Tajik ambassador to Kazakhstan and his staff were implicated in the most sensational of such scandals, when, in May 2000, Kazakh authorities discovered 62 kg of heroin concealed in secret compartments of the ambassador\u2019s car.15 Similarly, in 2005, the commander and two senior officials of the State Border Protection Committee unit deployed in Shurobod District, one of the major entry points along the Tajik \u2013Afghan border, were detained for drug trafficking.16 However, in order to give a comprehensive picture, we need to stress how in parallel with high-profile collusions, petty corruption is also widespread. Tajik policemen, soldiers and civil servants earn very small salaries, ranging from US$10 to US$30 a month, hence they have every incentive to accept a bribe and turn a blind eye when they discover a drug shipment.17 According to official sources, 800 civil servants were arrested on charges of drug trafficking between 2000 and 2005.18 Thus the political backing that drug mafias enjoy, together with their actual power to bribe individual soldiers and civil servants, have allowed them to continue their illegal business with impunity throughout the post-conflict period. Problems of under-funding for law-enforcement agencies, lack of coordination and corruption have precluded the development of a coherent national counter-narcotic policy in Tajikistan. Some operations against drug traffickers have been carried out in the last 10 years, but no major smuggling network has been brought to trial so far. International counter-narcotics assistance: donors, implementing agencies and beneficiaries Security assistance is one of the major fields of commitment for foreign donors in Tajikistan. Neighbouring states, regional powers and Western countries are involved in a multiplicity of initiatives aimed at assisting the Tajik government in its control and border-management efforts. Between 1996 and 2003 17 international treaties and agreements (six multilateral and 11 bilateral) have been signed by the Tajik government on drug-related issues.19 Russia was the main partner of the Tajik government in the field of security during the first phase of the country\u2019s independence. When the civil war broke out Moscow decided that it would have to keep its soldiers on the borders of Tajikistan with China and Afghanistan. Between 11,000 and 16,500 Russian soldiers remained deployed along those frontiers. The decision to maintain a large contingent of armed forces in Tajikistan was taken mainly for broader geopolitical reasons. Given the situation of instability in Tajikistan, Moscow could not risk that those former USSR external borders remained un-patrolled (Jonson 1998, 2006). Central Asian Survey 133 Thus, also in the security sector, Russia maintained its role as major partner of the Tajik government during the 1990s. But after 9/11, Central Asia has also become an area of key strategic interest for Western governments. Since 2001 the US and its allies have sought to increase their commitment in the region, and, as they recognized the drug trade as a major security threat to regional stability, funding for counter-narcotics and border-management assistance has considerably augmented. For example in 2007, of the US$45.2 million of total assistance by the US government to Tajikistan, 20.34 million were destined for law enforcement and security assistance.20 Projects funded by the US are carried out both at bilateral and multilateral level. The Department of State is the main contributor in terms of bilateral assistance, while at the multilateral level the United Nations Office for Drug and Crime (UNODC), the International Organization for Migrations (IOM), and the Open Society Institute (OSI) receive funding from Washington for narcotics interdiction, border management and drug-demand-reduction projects.21 The European Union is also directly involved in counter-narcotics assistance: two major projects, the Border Mangement in Central Asia (BOMCA) programme, and the Central Asia Drug Addiction Programme (CADAP) were launched in 2003. Between 2003 and 2007 the European Commission committed E43 million for the implementation of these two projects.22", ""], "id": "5e30b9146d8b3c2316cbf68b79b226ad9c895a51345059e1e5e13e446fde0fee", "highlighted_text": "Corruption seriously hinders the effectiveness Russia was the main partner of the Tajik government in the field of security The decision to maintain a large contingent of armed forces in Tajikistan was taken mainly for broader geopolitical reasons Russia maintained its role as major partner of the Tajik government The E U is also directly involved in counter-narcotics assistance", "highlights": [[2, 2672, 2682], [2, 2688, 2723], [2, 5241, 5317], [2, 5597, 5720], [2, 5937, 6004], [2, 7029, 7034], [2, 7042, 7043], [2, 7048, 7105]], "underlines": [[2, 4, 34], [2, 504, 589], [2, 686, 735], [2, 736, 738], [2, 739, 757], [2, 1241, 1468], [2, 1953, 2041], [2, 2101, 2336], [2, 2376, 2484], [2, 2672, 2682], [2, 2683, 2687], [2, 2688, 2723], [2, 2724, 2753], [2, 4741, 4883], [2, 5241, 5317], [2, 5597, 5720], [2, 5937, 6004], [2, 6127, 6303], [2, 6305, 6394], [2, 7029, 7034], [2, 7034, 7035], [2, 7035, 7041], [2, 7042, 7043], [2, 7043, 7047], [2, 7048, 7105]], "emphasis": [[2, 1241, 1468], [2, 2672, 2682], [2, 2688, 2723], [2, 5241, 5317], [2, 5597, 5720], [2, 5937, 6004], [2, 7029, 7034], [2, 7034, 7035], [2, 7042, 7043], [2, 7048, 7105]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 13]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2011-03-01"}, {"tag": "That turns case and offers no chance of reform", "cite": "Barmin 18 Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed.

The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there.", "", ""], "id": "6e7d8d556bb8618a43b81a0389a01e79527650046ec60960380fd6dade04b24e", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

March 1, 2018. https://www.georgetownjournalofinternationalaffairs.org/online-edition/2018/3/1/drug-trafficking-in-tajikistan-a-very-deep-but-not-incurable-evil)", "body": ["For many years, Tajikistan has been gravely affected by drug trafficking. At least 15-20 tons of opium and between 75 and 80 metric tons of heroin are smuggled into the country each year from Afghanistan either for local consumption or for transfer to Russia and Europe. Despite an official Tajik government policy to fight illicit drug trafficking in cooperation with foreign governments and international organizations, trafficking continues to increase. The volume of drug transit through Tajikistan is now equivalent to 30 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. So far, the success of domestic Tajik policies and international assistance has been minimal. Trafficking is a product of numerous complex factors, including large-scale opium production in Afghanistan, a growing economic and social crisis in Tajikistan, and complicity within the Tajik administration. Faced with these realities, the international community must revise its anti-drug policy in Tajikistan and better calibrate it to domestic Tajik issues in two ways. First, it must attack illicit drug trade and distribution networks by reducing corruption and poverty; second, it must reduce drug use through prevention and treatment programs. In the fifteen years since NATO forces committed to combating drug production in Afghanistan, drug production in the country has increased. This has had a significant impact on Tajikistan, one of the main export routes. It is estimated that at least 20 percent of Afghan drugs move through the country. Traffickers increasingly exploit the Central Asian route through Tajikistan to reach Russia and China, where drug use has been steadily increasing in recent years. Moreover, the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) in 2014 has opened up the region by loosening the borders between its member states and made it easier for drug traffickers to reach Europe once they make it past the porous, 810-mile-long Afghan-Tajik border and through Tajikistan. Should Tajikistan join the EEU, which has no border controls among its member states \u2014 comprised of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan \u2014 traffickers will have an even easier time moving drugs through the country. Since the 1990s, the international community has consistently invested in the fight against drug trafficking into and through Tajikistan. China and Russia have engaged in bilateral and multilateral cooperation under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The United States has spent nearly $200 million since 2001 on security assistance for Tajikistan, focused on training and equipping special military and police units. The EU-funded Border Management for Central Asia program, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\u2019s Border Management Staff College, and the UN International Organization for Migration border projects together spent $83 million between 2005 and 2013 in this effort. Many individual donor nations also continue to invest in border facilities, outposts, and equipment. Responsibility for the increase in drug trafficking has often been assigned to Afghanistan, Islamist groups such as the Taliban, and local and regional Islamist networks, including the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. This narrative, favored by Tajik authorities, makes it easier for them to raise anti-trafficking funding by emphasizing the links to terrorism. However, other factors also contribute to the problem. While the growth of production in Afghanistan continues to feed drug trafficking in Tajikistan, the trafficking increase also stems from the internal political, economic and social context in Tajikistan. Drug trafficking has developed in Tajikistan partly through the efforts of small traffickers, for whom it provides a means of daily survival. For the past several years, Tajikistan has also been experiencing a serious social crisis caused by dwindling economic resources, government resistance to reform, corruption and misappropriation of revenues. More recently, this difficult economic situation has been compounded by the economic crisis in Russia, a country which has been a major destination for at least 1.15 million Tajik migrant workers. Their remittances, making up approximately 49 percent of Tajikistan's GDP, have declined considerably in the last three years. Arrest statistics in Tajikistan show an increasing number of individuals who have been willing to transport drugs to meet their basic needs. However, most of the drug trafficking is organized by criminal groups. These are usually run by local drug barons and are often indirectly supported by parts of the local population. These groups step in where the government has failed, providing social welfare in poor regions of the country. Furthermore, some government officials allow local drug barons or local administrative officials \u2013 who are sometimes one and the same \u2013 to develop illicit drug rings that permit them to get rich in exchange for political allegiance and assistance in maintaining social stability. Official involvement is one of the main difficulties international organizations face in fighting drug trafficking in Tajikistan. On-site research shows that some law enforcement officials oversee trafficking, provide traffickers with drugs seized during arrests, protect allied dealers and arrest their competitors. This system exists quite openly, with dealers operating in full view of state structures. The presidential family and its close circles are believed to be among the main beneficiaries of these activities. President Emomali Rahmon has steadily consolidated his financial base by placing family members in key government positions. In particular, his eldest son Rustam has held several official positions, including head of the customs service, and is suspected of taking bribes to allow cross-border traffic. Beyond the President's official speeches at international summits or meetings, Tajik authorities have shown little initiative in implementing the many programs proposed by international organizations, as they may reduce the profits that some officials derive from trafficking. The complicity of these local officials explains in part why less than 5 percent of the drugs passing through Tajikistan are seized by law enforcement, and why few major traffickers are arrested. On the rare occasions when large-scale trafficking is uncovered, it typically settles a score amongst elite commercial and political rivals. The main targets of the security services are small traffickers, whose arrests allow authorities to inflate the statistics of seizures they provide to international organizations, and to exculpate themselves from their complicity. In this way, the international community sometimes helps corrupt officials eliminate their drug-trafficking competition. There is no easy solution to the problem of drug trafficking in Tajikistan. First and foremost, as long there is no real willingness on the part of state structures to fight drug trafficking, border security and training initiatives will not have a serious impact. Moreover, the international community's commitment to Tajikistan cannot be truly effective unless it places greater emphasis on concrete implementation of programs, as opposed to allowing their use as public relations rhetoric by political authorities. Secondly, international and regional cooperation has erroneously focused on upstream security and border issues, and neglected downstream development and health factors. Meanwhile, domestic drug use has increased steadily over the past decade in Tajikistan; it is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people inject drugs. Treatment centers are poorly equipped and oriented towards abstinence. Moreover, the tendency to criminalize drug addicts complicates the implementation of effective prevention strategies. International efforts to combat drug trafficking from Afghanistan could be more effective if they focused more on demand reduction, treatment and prevention campaigns. Finally, serious social and governance problems in Tajikistan will continue to feed drug trafficking in a society that publicly criticizes, but practically accepts, corruption and trafficking. The impact of the international community will remain limited as long as state officials fighting this illicit trade receive low wages, which are often less than $150 per month. In Tajikistan, wealthy traffickers have become objects of admiration for an increasing number of idle youth. Drug trafficking will not significantly decrease without socio-economic development and poverty reduction. Such a long-term perspective calls for strong commitment from the international community, matched by local political authorities determined to end corruption, nepotism and cronyism.", ""], "id": "c1d3ab6a9dbb90f8a1493b66ecd9f886cb86bdb6e14c5ec248bc794385e496e8", "highlighted_text": "Trafficking is a product of numerous complex factors, including large-scale opium production in Afghanistan, a growing economic and social crisis in Tajikistan, and complicity the international community must revise its anti-drug policy in two ways.

Less debated is the spread and depth of Russia\u2019s contemporary presence and profile in Africa. There was a strong Russian influence in Africa during the heyday of the Soviet Union. The post-independence governments of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Benin at some point all received diplomatic or military support from the Soviet Union. But this began to change after the superpower started to collapse in December 1991. More than a quarter of a century later Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin seems to have new aspirations in Africa. This is in line with his desire to restore Russia to great power status. Trade and investment between Russia and Africa has grown exponentially by 185% from 2005 to 2015. Putin places a high premium on geopolitical relations and the pursuit of Russian assertiveness in the global arena. This includes reestablishing Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, which extends to the African continent. Like Beijing, Moscow\u2019s method of trade and investment in Africa is without the prescriptions or conditionalities of actors like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia is gradually increasing its influence in Africa through strategic investment in energy and minerals. It\u2019s also using military muscle and soft power. Increasingly, the pressing question is: is the relationship between China and Africa as good for Africa as it is for China? The same question applies to Russia-Africa relations. Energy and minerals Interaction between Russia and Africa has grown exponentially this century, with trade and investment growing by 185% between 2005 and 2015. Economically, much of Russia\u2019s focus in Africa centers on energy. Key Russian investments in Africa are in the oil, gas and nuclear power sectors. The fact that 620 million people in Africa don\u2019t have electricity provides Russia\u2019s nuclear power industry with potential markets. Several Russian companies, such as Gazprom, Lukoil, Rostec and Rosatom are active in Africa. Most activity is in Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Nigeria and Uganda.

", "body": ["Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to power in Russia in 2012 signified a dramatic change in the country\u2019s foreign policy and military strategy. Scrapping the achievements of the Dmitry Medvedev era in the Kremlin, which was characterized by a thaw in relations with the West, Vladimir Putin opted for a more aggressive approach toward positioning the country in the international arena. Experts still argue what prompted this review of the country\u2019s foreign policy strategy, but the developments that likely had a major impact on Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy planning in 2012 included the war with Georgia in 2008, the Arab Spring protests, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) infamous military campaign in Libya, which brought down Russia\u2019s long-time ally Muammar Qaddafi. Contours of the new policy approach to the region started to emerge when Russia updated two of its key documents, the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation and the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.[i] The documents pronounced strategies based on protecting Russian national interests abroad, including militarily if need be, and increasing Moscow\u2019s role in maintaining global security. Quite notably, a more recent edition of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, signed by President Putin in November 2016, has a specific focus on the Middle East and names foreign meddling there as one of the causes of instability and extremism in the region that directly affect Russia.[ii] The statement that serves as de facto justification for the Russian military campaign in Syria became the first official document to elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East and North Africa. In the three years that divide the two concepts, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to foreign policy experienced an evolution and increasing securitization (the word \u201cterrorism\u201d figures 15 times in the 2013 Concept and 35 in its 2016 edition). The Foreign Policy Concept also spells out the Russian president\u2019s growing ambition to deal with instability where it originates before it reaches Russian borders. The rationale behind Russia\u2019s re-emergence as one of the leading powers in the Middle East was of a defensive nature and largely reactionary. The Arab Spring movement in the region was a painful reminder of the Color Revolutions that broke out across several post-Soviet states in the first half of the 2000s and, according to the Kremlin, led to the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself is of the belief that that the Arab Spring is a continuation of those Color Revolutions and that both are foreign-instigated.[iii] Coupled with a forced revolution in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi in what Russia declared was a violation of international law, this episode is often cited as a watershed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking.[iv] A wave of revolutions across Eurasia convinced the Russian leadership that the apparent domino effect of regime change would eventually target Russia. It is not a coincidence that the Russian president likens Color Revolutions and the Arab Spring protests to each other and often makes no distinction between them. Commenting on anti-corruption protests in Russia in March 2017, he went as far as to call them \u201can instrument of the Arab Spring.\u201d[v] Vladimir Putin sees Russia as a legitimate actor in designing a new power balance in the Middle East and as its integral part since security challenges originating in the region reverberate across the former Soviet space as well as in Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is an outsider in this region in the view of Russian officials. Criticism of the White House over its \u201cdestructive\u201d role in the Middle East is a central theme of many of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speeches, including the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly prior to launching his military campaign in Syria in September 2015. In those remarks, the Russian president accused the United States of being the source of problems in the Middle East.[vi] A gradual withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East under Barack Obama among other things meant that the region\u2019s \u201cpoliceman\u201d was no longer interested in maintaining order there, which arguably presented Moscow with numerous security challenges. Russia\u2019s re-emergence in the Middle East to a large extent happened to fill some of the void left by the retreating Obama administration. In some cases it happened effortlessly, such as in Egypt, where the US decision to cut aid to Cairo in 2013 led to the emergence of a budding Russia-Egypt alliance. In other contexts, most prominently in Syria, Russia had to invest significant diplomatic and military resources to marginalize the US in the war and in the peace process. What started out as an attempt to replace the United States where it was no longer interested in playing a leading role later transformed into an ambition to challenge the US even where it had no intention of retreating, for instance in the Gulf region. Russia\u2019s return to the Middle East differs from the Soviet experience: Today, Moscow is extending its reach without the baggage of Soviet ideology. The idea of using its arms exports to the Middle East in the ideological struggle against the West evaporated as soon as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) disintegrated and was replaced with the idea of making a profit for the cash-strapped budget. The Kremlin is looking to support its geopolitical claims with a strong pragmatic dimension. In the Middle East, Moscow to reinforce its influence there as well as offset the burden upon the Russian federal budget associated with the expenses of the Syrian campaign. Following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, Russia has used arms deals to reach out to Cold War\u2013era allies in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance. During the Cold War, Wynfred Joshua and Stephen P. Gilbert wrote that as more countries became recipients of Soviet military aid programs, there was a tendency for these countries to become greater political allies of the Soviet Union.[vii] And it seems that this argument is increasingly relevant today. According to SIPRI, in 2015 $5.5 billion in Russian arms exports were destined for clients in the Middle East, which was ten times more than all Russian experts to the region for all of the 1990s.[viii] With Vladimir Putin declaring victory over the Islamic State during his December 2017 visit to Syria, Russia is faced with a number of opportunities as well as challenges. Its military operation in Syria may have put Russia back on the radar in the Middle East; but in all certainty, it essentially solidified its position in the region. As Vladimir Putin is eyeing re-election as president in March 2018, foreign policy achievements, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, figure prominently in his election campaign rhetoric. One of the effects of Russia\u2019s assertive foreign policy has become an expectation from regional partners and opponents alike that Moscow will be active in the Middle East. However, the hard power that brought Russia to prominence in the region will not be a helpful tool to support long-term influence there and could, in fact, produce a negative impact for Russia\u2019s international standing. As a result, during his next term in office, Vladimir Putin will be faced with a challenge to depart from hard power, his preferred modus operandi, to embrace a spectrum of other tools in order to make Russia\u2019s presence in the region lasting and sustainable.", ""], "id": "c7e4a68e2cd28b87198fc5ab4f34ec1e4e564d95dd62741881dc8f15c8c2a26a", "highlighted_text": "Putin has a specific focus Putin sees Russia designing a new power balance gradual withdrawal of the United States Russia\u2019s re-emergence to fill the void Russia has used arms deals to Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance .

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there."], "id": "499c9c9a5c97e4a83203e796c60073145d7e6912c172174aba5dfd59dd9c7403", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

Violence has buffeted the Muslim-led nation of Sudan and mostly Christian and animist South Sudan, the world's newest independent state. Humanitarian agencies say that clashes since South Sudan asserted its independence have led more than 350,000 Sudanese to flee into the new country from the Khartoum-administrated north. Media reports say thousands have been killed there. There are also simmering disputes between the countries over oil revenue. Increased fighting in Somalia after an incursion by Kenya aimed at subduing Al-Shabaab militants has displaced tens of thousands of Somalis, disrupted the movement of goods and delayed planting of staple crops. Meanwhile inside Kenya, frequent security sweeps and strident rhetoric by Kenyan leaders about suspected Al-Shabaab militants in their midst has led to intense scrutiny of Somali immigrant communities like Eastleigh, a predominately Muslim enclave of Nairobi. The Islamic militant group has long used Kenya as a base, and strong ties exist between the armed group and Somali immigrants. A series of kidnappings and grenade attacks against Kenyan civilians since the invasion has heightened tensions. \"The Kenyan intervention may itself sow seeds of radicalization if every Somali immigrant is accused of terrorism or if it attempts to create a Kenyan colony in Somalia,\" said Comfort Ero, the Africa Program director for the International Crisis Group in Nairobi. The recent clashes in Nigeria, as well as in Sudan and Somalia, also have spotlighted the risk of some of the more sophisticated militant groups joining forces. As the U.S. withdraws troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, security officials say the Horn of Africa is emerging as the next battleground in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates. In a Friday speech, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said al Qaeda no longer has the capability to stage a 9/11-style attack and that its leadership has been \"decimated.\" \"But we need to continue that pressure,\" he said. \"We need to keep going after them wherever they go, whether it's Yemen or Somalia or North Africa.\" Ms. Ero, of International Crisis Group, said sectarian tensions have risen in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.

From southern Africa in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, and even Zimbabwe to the long wars in the Horn in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan to the Great Lakes wars in Rwanda and Uganda, the typical armed conflict in Africa involved two major, territory-holding armies fighting each other for state control. Today's wars typically are smaller. They most often involve small insurgencies of factionalised rebels on the peripheries of states. Today's wars also play out differently. They exhibit cross-border dimensions, and rather than drawing funding from big external states they depend on illicit trade, banditry, and international terrorist networks. Typical of today's wars are the rebels in Casamance, in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, various armed groups in Darfur, and the Lord's Resistance Army. The latter typifies an emerging trend of trans-national insurgents. The LRA moves across multiple states in the Great Lakes region. Northern Mali is another case in point \u2013 prior to seizing control of the north, the Islamists moved across multiple countries in the Sahel. Once they gained territorial control in 2012, they attracted fighters from Nigeria and across North Africa. Moreover, these are not non-ideological wars, as Gettleman claims.

For years, its army has served as a proxy force for the US War on Terror in Eastern and Central Africa. During the 1990s, the Ugandan military, with US support, fought dirty wars in Sudan, Rwanda, and Zaire in order to ensure Central Africa\u2019s estimated $24 trillion in coltan, uranium, gold, and other mineral riches remained in the West\u2019s sphere of influence. Today, more than 6,000 US-supported Ugandan troops are battling the Islamist group Al Shabaab in Somalia and thousands more serve as guards in Iraq. President Donald Trump\u2019s Arab allies are now reportedly negotiating the recruitment of thousands of Ugandans to join the ghastly quagmire in Yemen. In exchange for Uganda\u2019s military favors, Washington has long turned a blind eye to grave human-rights abuses committed by its leader Yoweri Museveni\u2014who has held power for 32 years through brute force, election rigging, and corruption. But with Museveni\u2019s most recent attacks on opposition figures, the United States is now ignoring one of the most evil and blatant recent assaults on democracy anywhere in the world. In February 2016, Museveni was declared winner of Uganda\u2019s seventh presidential election. The poll had been marred, like others, by police raids on opposition rallies, the arrest of opposition candidates, the killing of unarmed opposition supporters, and electoral fraud. At the time, Uganda\u2019s Constitution limited the age of presidential candidates to 75, making Museveni, who claims to be 73, ineligible to run in the next election, scheduled for 2021. However, during the summer of 2017, a back-bencher from Museveni\u2019s party named Raphael Magyezi began drafting a bill to remove the age limit from the Constitution. If passed, it would enable Museveni to rule indefinitely. Reputable polls found some 80 percent of Ugandans opposed lifting the age limit, but all Museveni needed was the support of a two-thirds majority of Uganda\u2019s 427 MPs. Museveni\u2019s political machine runs on a war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars, much of it stolen from the Treasury and foreign-aid programs. This ensures his party has a comfortable parliamentary majority, so that if Magyezi\u2019s bill were to be voted on, it would surely pass. Nevertheless, MPs like Nambooze who opposed the amendment were emboldened by the knowledge that Uganda\u2019s people were behind them and launched a campaign to block it. Known as Togikwatako, or \u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d\u2014a common parental warning to Ugandan children\u2014the campaign organized demonstrations against the age-limit amendment around the country. Museveni\u2019s forces responded by shooting student demonstrators and arresting activists passing out Togikwatako leaflets and MPs making Togikwatako speeches. On September 19, the day Magyezi\u2019s bill was to be introduced, tanks were deployed around Parliament and police carrying military-grade weapons closed off surrounding streets to prevent demonstrations. But as soon as the session was called to order, Togikwatako MPs donned red headbands\u2014the symbol of their campaign\u2014and began trying to filibuster the bill by singing Uganda\u2019s national anthem over and over while waving copies of the Constitution. Uganda\u2019s formidable Parliamentary Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, in black robes and white-horsehair judicial wig glared down at them from the dais and closed the session without introducing Magyezi\u2019s bill. Afterward, the Togikwatako MPS danced and sang in the hallways, punching their fists in the air in triumph. Nambooze received the \u201cthey will break your back\u201d threat from her colleague the following Monday. Since joining politics in 2000, she\u2019d been arrested numerous times and even breastfed two of her children in jail. Though worried, she attended the sitting the next day anyway. The filibuster stunts resumed under Speaker Kadaga\u2019s expressionless gaze. At one point, a scuffle broke out when Museveni loyalist Ronald Kibuule brandished a gun at Togikwatako MP Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda, and, according to Ssemujju, told him to prepare for a bullet in his nervous system. Again the session ended without the introduction of Magyezi\u2019s bill. That night, operatives from Museveni\u2019s elite special forces snuck into Parliament, checking the routes in and out of the central chamber and identifying the locations of security cameras. Speaker Kadaga opened Parliament the following afternoon by announcing the suspension of 25 mostly Togikwatako MPs, including Nambooze. Kadaga then departed the chamber as dozens of operatives in business attire streamed in via Museveni\u2019s private entrance and began violently arresting the MPs Kadaga had named. Images of what looked like MPs throwing chairs, fencing with microphone stands, pirouetting on tables, and waving the Ugandan flag like toreadors were broadcast on the Internet and even evoked merriment on Trevor Noah\u2019s The Daily Show. But off camera, something horrible was happening. While attempting to assist a fellow MP who had been slugged by an army officer, Nambooze found herself face to face with about six of the burly intruders. They led her to a small room without security cameras where two of them grabbed her from behind and began squeezing her shoulders and arms together. Then one of them shoved a knee into her back, and Nambooze felt something break. The pain was so intense, she thought she might die. Her assailants were dressed like women, but she told a local reporter that she had her doubts: \u201cI could not see them, because they held me from behind but the hands were so hairy and I doubt that they were actually women.\u201d Nambooze was rescued when a female member of the Parliamentary police force that routinely patrols the building burst in. \u201cWhy are you killing Hon Nambooze?\u201d she recalled the officer shouting. Her tormentors released her, but she was no longer able to stand unaided and fell to the ground. In November she was flown to India where surgeons performed a six-hour operation in which metal implants were inserted in her spine so she could walk again. After the raid, attendance at Parliament dwindled and the filibusters ceased. But Togikwatako demonstrations continued around the country, and in October, police shot dead three unarmed demonstrators. Several NGOs that had been supporting community education about the age-limit amendment were shut down by the police, and explosives were thrown at the homes of some Togikwatako MPs. The presidential-age-limit amendment passed on December 20, 2017. Early in the New Year, Nambooze\u2019s health began deteriorating, and by spring the pain had become unbearable. She arranged to travel to India to consult her surgeon, planning to fly out on June 15. But on June 8, masked men on motorcycles gunned down Ibrahim Abiriga, a ruling-party MP whom Nambooze had once teased for always wearing yellow\u2014signifying his loyalty to Museveni. Such drive-by motorcycle murders have become increasingly frequent in Uganda; a police commander, a senior prosecutor, several Muslim sheiks, and many others have been killed in this way in recent years. While Abiriga\u2019s killers are not known, his constituents rioted before his burial, shouting, \u201cWe don\u2019t want yellow!\u201d and blamed the government for his death. In a Facebook message of condolence to Abiriga\u2019s family, Nambooze wrote, \u201cUganda will be better not through elimination of those we don\u2019t agree with, but because of our effort to put up systems that will work for us all irrespective of our political beliefs. Every life must be respected and every murder must be condemned.\u201d Her message also lamented that Abiriga had allowed himself to become a \u201cloud speaker\u201d for Museveni and his henchmen\u2014\u201cwho have chosen to love power more than the future of our Uganda\u201d\u2014a sentiment shared by thousands of Ugandans on Twitter. Three days later, Nambooze was arrested on charges of \u201coffensive communication,\u201d in connection with the Facebook post. She paid bail and was released, but during a budget speech the next day, Museveni announced that bail for murder suspects would be scrapped. Nambooze was immediately rearrested, and for two days she lay in a bare jail cell on a wooden bench, unable to sit up or stand. She was then taken to a hospital, but on the way a police vehicle rammed into the ambulance, further damaging her spine and severely injuring her knee. While it\u2019s impossible to prove, Nambooze suspects the collision was deliberate and intended to further physically traumatize her. Doctors later determined that one of the metal screws implanted in her back had been dislodged and was pressing on a major nerve. Demonstrations broke out around the country, and she was finally released on bond and flown to India for another round of surgery on July 4. In recent years, Uganda\u2019s security forces have manipulated elections, tortured nonviolent political activists, and shot dead roughly 100 unarmed people\u2014including 14 children in a traditional palace in western Uganda. Government security forces have also thrown countless peasants off their land to make way for politically connected investors such as Total, which is constructing an oil pipeline, and General Electric, which is building a refinery in western Uganda As Uganda\u2019s largest foreign-aid donor\u2014with over $500 million in grants per year, plus an unknown amount of classified military aid\u2014the US government has the leverage to rein Museveni in. Much of our aid pays for medical and other humanitarian projects, which should continue, but US tax dollars also flow through the World Bank directly into Uganda\u2019s treasury, where much of it is looted to fund Museveni\u2019s repression. Suspending aid to Museveni might also help quell tensions in Uganda\u2019s war-torn neighborhood. For far too long, gullible US national-security officials have relied on Museveni to interpret Central Africa\u2019s complex regional conflicts, including the wars in South Sudan and Congo, even as Museveni himself has exacerbated those conflicts by arming one side or the other, while pretending to be a peacemaker.

The move was one of Trump\u2019s harshest yet as he escalates a confrontation with Mexico and Central America over a surge in irregular migration, largely involving children and families seeking asylum. Trump has already warned that he could close the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 or at least large stretches of it \u2014 in the coming week unless Mexico takes further steps to halt the northward flow of migrants.

Some Trump administration officials thought the program had failed to achieve enough results and in recent months have been looking into alternatives. But the president\u2019s decision to cut off the remaining funds appeared to take many people by surprise.

The number of apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border has been soaring, with more than 76,000 migrants taken into U.S. custody in February, most of them from Central America.

President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the caravan has been to militarize the border, attempt to change the laws regulating asylum seeking, and threaten that \u201cno more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately\u201d if the group is not turned back. These responses are additional examples of the U.S. government\u2019s increasingly hardline but shortsighted stance to the problems faced by Central America. In the last year, the United States has pushed for increased criminal prosecution of immigration offenses, including the separation of children from their parents at the border. We have also seen the elimination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, and repeated threats to cut foreign aid to the region. These policies are intended to curb illegal immigration, but could in fact do the opposite. Honduras faces serious challenges, including a high homicide rate, weak rule of law, and limited employment opportunities. This migrant caravan demonstrates Hondurans\u2019 frustration with those problems. Although Honduras remains a difficult place for many, progress has been made in Honduras in important areas such as education, health, violence reduction, and corruption. This progress is significant but fragile, as political and economic elites who have pushed back. Without firm and sustained international support, hard-won advances in Honduras could quickly be overturned. Threats to cut foreign aid put both reform efforts and those who promote them at risk. Now is not the time for the United States to blink, to cut off aid to Honduras, or to try to double our defense on the one-yard line. Now is the time to increase support for the real progress that has been made both in reducing violence and corruption. Fragile Progress in Violence and Organized Crime In 2011 Honduras\u2019 homicide rate was 86.5 per 100,000\u2014the highest in the world. Six years later, in 2017, it was 43.6 per 100,000, nearly a 50 percent drop in just six years. This drop can be attributed to a concerted effort of civil society, international donors, and government actors. For example, the Coalition against Impunity, comprised mostly of human rights organizations, has fiercely critiqued government inaction on anti-corruption and human rights matters, thereby holding judicial officials\u2019 feet to the fire. The Alliance for Peace and Justice offers critiques of the government but is also willing to work with officials who show good faith. Both the Coalition and the Alliance serve as civil society\u2019s version of a carrot and stick, to incentivize authorities to improve the justice system. In 2016, after the New York Times released the names of Honduran police officers accused of colluding with drug traffickers, President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez appointed a police purge commission made up of members of civil society. This commission has removed over 5,000 individuals from the 11,000-member force, replacing them with 8,000 new recruits trained through a year-long, rigorous program that relies on important investments from the United States, Switzerland, and the Inter-American Development Bank. Both local and international organizations have worked closely with the Attorney General\u2019s office helping to build capacity to fight drugs, organized crime, and corruption. An extradition agreement with the United States signed in 2012 was used for the first time in 2014, and since then 43 drug traffickers have been extradited or have turned themselves in to U.S. law enforcement, dismantling major criminal organizations in the country. Since 2015, the Honduran Attorney General\u2019s office has seized over $1.5 billion in assets following arrests for drug trafficking and organized crime. There is much more to be done in Honduras, and many significant challenges. Corruption remains an issue in the police, the courts, and the Attorney General\u2019s office. Homicides have dropped but they remain high, and issues like gang extortion and domestic violence still are drastically underreported. But progress is being made. Honduras\u2019 President and Attorney General have put their support behind these positive changes because of both pressure and support from civil society and the international community. Foreign aid helps to tip the cost-benefit analysis for politicians and leaders, showing them that if they do the right thing, the United States will have their back. Cutting aid to Honduras not only halts the positive change we are beginning to see; such a move also leaves those who have bravely taken on substantial risk to bring about change without the protection and international support that this aid provides. Fragile Progress in Corruption and Transparency Civil society involvement has also led to significant but fragile change in the arenas of anti-corruption and transparency, including important reforms in public education, medicine procurement in the public health sector, and the establishment of an international anti-corruption body. Transformemos Honduras, a coalition of religious and nonprofit organizations, has exposed corruption in teachers\u2019 unions and substantially reduced corruption and clientelism in the hiring of teachers and education administrators. Transformemos Honduras released evidence that 26 percent of Honduran teachers on the payroll were not in their assigned classrooms, and that Honduran schools managed just 125 class days per year. Those investigations led to reforms that resulted in returning teachers to their classrooms and increasing the school year to more than 200 days. Transformemos Honduras also uncovered serious corruption in government procurement of medicine that resulted in the theft of an estimated 30\u201340 percent of the government budget for medicine. Their report led the Honduran government to create a system under which the United Nations Office of Project Services now purchases all medicines through a Honduran government trust fund, reducing loss and corruption in the purchasing process. In 2015, the National Anti-Corruption Council, another civil society anti-corruption organization, began working on a corruption case involving over $300 million stolen from the Honduran social security system. The scandal spawned massive protests. One result of these protests was the establishment of the Support Mission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH, in Spanish), part of the OAS\u2019s secretariat for political affairs and special missions, and comprised of international experts brought in to investigate emblematic corruption cases in Honduras. The MACCIH has spearheaded several key corruption investigations, including one against former First Lady Rosa Elena de Lobo, and the \u201cPandora\u201d case, which implicates high-ranking members of Congress in acts of corruption. These cases have prompted fierce pushback by members of the elite, including a challenge to the constitutionality of the MACCIH, and legal reforms making it significantly more difficult to prosecute corruption. Extradition, asset seizure, and preventative detention had previously been applied to drug traffickers and gang members without much pushback from Honduran elites, but once the MACCIH and Attorney General\u2019s office began to focus on well-connected officials, prominent political and business elites reacted with force. One law approved by Congress in the wake of MACCIH\u2019s cases required corruption cases to be first handled by an administrative auditing commission with a 7\u201310 year backlog of audits. This law virtually assures that new corruption cases will not make it to criminal court. While the political pushback is frustrating, it is, ironically, an encouraging sign of progress. Corrupt government officials clearly feel threatened by the coordinated anti-corruption work led by civil society and supported by the international community and key government actors, such as the Attorney General\u2019s office, the Anti-Corruption Unit of the Attorney General\u2019s office (UFECIC), and the MACCIH. Sustained Support Is Needed Honduras\u2019 progress against violence and corruption is currently in a vulnerable place. Civil society has lost some battles against corruption and violence, minority groups and activists continue to be in serious danger, and threats to human rights continue. The MACCIH survived this last fight to be eliminated but did not emerge unscathed; it continues its work under some burdensome new requirements. It needs support, nationally and internationally, so that it can continue to battle the corruption of powerful elites. The United Nations is leading the country in a dialogue process after a controversial election in November 2017, but the process has been bogged down by political infighting and has made little progress. Meanwhile, under President Hern\u00e1ndez, the executive branch has concentrated power and the country\u2019s military continues to grow, with a budget increase of approximately 660 percent in five years, compared to a judiciary budget increase of only 160 percent.[2] Despite these challenges, there is good news in Honduras. Brave civil society groups are advocating for and seeing institutional reforms which have resulted in real-life changes: halving the homicide rate, nearly doubling the days of school, and improving transparency in the purchase of medicines. Civil society leaders are putting themselves at risk. And they need international support as they work for advances that are in the best interest of both Honduras and the United States \u2013 confronting drug trafficking and criminal groups, and improving the lives and livelihoods of Hondurans who are so desperate that they would walk across a continent to try to make a better life elsewhere. We can achieve a safer and more just Honduras. But this requires sustained investment in rule of law, anti-corruption, and systemic reform measures. Making progress toward these objectives requires international interest and accountability as well as a sign from the United States that it will stand by those who work on behalf of these reforms.", ""], "id": "bd7776c767c8da23cae84cf3243e17b5e340f2def16cb8549458d8f113584b34", "highlighted_text": "no aid to Honduras are increasingly hardline but shortsighted stance to the problems progress has been made in Honduras in important areas such as education, health, violence reduction, and corruption.

Not because we\u2019re a great and magnanimous country, though we are; but rather because helping Hondurans mitigate the push factors of migration is manifestly in the U.S. interest. In our April article we made the case that, with the help of international and especially U.S. assistance and a vibrant civil society, things are slowly getting better in Honduras. The murder rate has been more than halved; progress has been made on addressing impunity and corruption; and drug traffickers continue to be arrested and extradited to the United States. But, we warned, an unholy alliance of corrupt politicians and criminal elements were fighting back against reform, seeking to take Honduras backwards into lawlessness and dysfunction. In short, the empire was striking back. Since then, through sustained effort by Honduran leaders and their civil society and international partners, some of these threats to progress have been beaten back. The MACCIH, an Organization of American States-sponsored body that fights corruption, was on the verge of being declared unconstitutional by the Honduran Supreme Court, for obvious reasons. In the end, under strong pressure from Hondurans backed by the weight of the international community, particularly the United States, the Court backed down and declared the MACCIH constitutional. And the appointment of a new head for MACCIH, stalled for months, was approved earlier this month. Four years ago the Honduran Congress approved an asset seizure law and it has been successfully used against dozens of drug traffickers and gang kingpins. But when it was used against the former First Lady and congressmen, the Honduran Congress tried to eliminate the law. Again, under heavy pressure from civil society and the international community, President Hern\u00e1ndez vetoed the change. Meanwhile, the same former First Lady, from the ruling National Party, has been jailed for corruption. Five members of the National Congress have been indicted and another 140 former and sitting members are under investigation, an extraordinary number given that the Honduran Congress has 128 representatives. In the last month, 38 government officials have been indicted for the theft of 11 million dollars from the Ministry of Agriculture. Last week, two more Members of Congress and a national party mayor were indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges, and the number of those already extradited or self-surrendered in the last four years is over 40. The Government of Honduras continues to cooperate closely with the United States on narcotrafficking and corruption investigations. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, a cynical attempt by politicians to elect a corruption-friendly Attorney General to replace incumbent Oscar Chinchilla was defeated, again in part due to pressure from civil society and the international community. Some argue that the process by which Chinchilla was re-elected was irregular, but it is very hard to argue that he hasn\u2019t been the most effective Attorney General in Honduras\u2019 history and the authority behind the investigations and indictments of corrupt politicians, and that his re-election sends a strong message regarding impunity and corruption.

The U.S. president has pledged to build a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border to curb illegal immigration. The bulk of migrants stopped trying to cross the border are now from those three violent and impoverished Central American nations. Since Trump became president, Hernandez said the United States had shown great willingness to work on combating street gangs known as maras that have menaced Central America. But it was less ready to support the region financially, he noted. Under a scheme to strengthen Central America launched in 2014 known as the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, the United States pledged to put forward a dollar for every four invested by Honduras, Hernandez said. But that commitment has not materialized, he added. \"That will obviously have repercussions,\" he told Reuters. \"Because the whole idea of the Alliance for Prosperity ... was to attack the migration problem at the root.\" Between 2016 and 2018, combined U.S. foreign aid for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador declined by more than one third to $195 million, according to official U.S. data. Adding to the challenges facing the region, the Trump administration announced earlier this year it would end temporary immigration protection for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Salvadorans living in the United States. Meanwhile, China is strengthening ties with Central America. Last month, El Salvador broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favor of China, citing economic reasons and following on the heels of Panama in 2017. Honduras is one of a dwindling number of countries that still has formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Hernandez said China's growing diplomatic presence posed a \"quandary\" for the region, but also \"an opportunity for all,\" provided there are \"clear rules.\" Other countries would likely follow the lead of El Salvador and Panama soon, he added. \"We see that things are changing in Central America.

As a nation receives more Chinese aid, its military increases its violence against civilians (including bombing them). State leaders and regimes further use this aid to finance their hold on power by repressing political competitors, such as other political parties and opponents, through tactics such as increased , , , and . In countries that receive different and varying levels of Chinese and Western aid, receipt of Chinese aid is followed by increases in police and military violence. Western aid is not followed by any such increase in violence. That\u2019s not because China funds countries that were already violent. Chinese aid does not disproportionately go to countries that typically have high rates of repression, such as dictatorships or countries well-endowed with natural resources. China\u2019s political agenda shapes who gets aid. For example, African states that recognize Taiwan will not receive any aid from China. How do we study Chinese aid and violence against civilians? We use conflict data from the , which makes it possible to distinguish the different rates, types and perpetrators of violence. We then compare those rates between states with different combinations of Western and Chinese aid flows. ACLED is the most comprehensive public collection of real-time political violence data for developing states, and is intended for policy, academic, and media users. Because it produces information on the specific dates and locations of political violence, the types of events, the groups involved, fatalities, and changes in territorial control, it is flexible to make comparisons across countries and aid types. The frequency of conflict and different types are mapped over the levels of Chinese aid to African states in the figure below (Chinese Aid data extend to 2011). So why does Chinese aid increase violence? To understand why Chinese aid increases African conflict while Western aid does not, it\u2019s important to understand who perpetrates political violence. When countries receive large amounts of unrestricted aid, that may attract opponents who want to get their hands on those funds. How a government distributes aid can be unequal and biased. If groups and regions believe they have not received a fair share, they can riot or attack their rivals for those funds. But while greedy opposition forces may be a problem, the most critical issue is, how a government and its security forces respond to aid. , which has been criticized for human rights abuses and for forcing the migration of people living in the Eastern area. The government is insisting on that exodus so it can develop large infrastructure for solar, wind, and water energy projects, with the goal of positioning itself as a major power producer.

China has helped Venezuela to create a factory to assemble drilling rigs to develop its oil, as well as other joint ventures for producing cars and cell phones. The PRC has also launched a telecommunication satellite for Venezuela in 2008, and has become an important telecom infrastructure provider. In addition, the PRC sells the country [Venezuela] increasingly sophisticated military end items, including air surveillance radars and military aircraft [2]. Ecuador and Bolivia have followed Venezuela\u2019s lead with respect to military purchases from the PRC. Ecuador, which had previously leased two MA-60 transport aircraft from the Chinese in 2007, is negotiating to purchase four more (El Universo, August 23), as well as taking delivery of two Chinese radars for evaluation, and purchasing four more, to be delivered by the first quarter of 2011 (El Universo, August 23). Bolivia, which previously received trucks, small boats and night vision goggles from the PRC, is now working with them to launch a satellite (Los Tiempos [Bolivia], July 22) and purchasing six K-8 aircraft for counter-narcotics missions after being denied access to U.S. and European planes (El Universo, October 2). In addition to providing resources, technical support and military goods that have contributed to the survival of the \u201ccaudillo socialist block,\u201d the PRC has also been contributing to Brazil\u2019s ascendancy as a regional power broker. Brazilian economic performance has been driven, in part, by its export-oriented iron and soy industries, for which China is a key customer. Indeed, the global recession emphasized and magnified the importance of China to Brazil. While Brazilian exports to the United States fell 37.8 percent in the first quarter of 2009, exports to the PRC increased by 62.7 percent (La Jornada [Nicaragua], May 4) thanks in part to a Chinese stimulus package that included $740 billion in infrastructure projects (Brazzil Magazine [Brazil], January 15), thus maintaining high levels of Chinese demand for factor inputs such as iron, purchased from Brazilian suppliers such as CVRD. Consequently, in the first half of 2009, China became Brazil\u2019s number one export destination (Xinhua News Agency [China], April 3). China has also emerged as a key financier as Brazil reaches out for the $174 billion that it requires to develop newly discovered deepwater oil reserves in the Campos and Santos basins. In discussing a $10 billion loan from China Development Bank to Brazil (La Nacion [Argentina], May 28), the president of Petrobras, Sergio Gabrielli, noted, \u201cThere isn\u2019t [sic] someone in the U.S. government that we can sit down with and have the kinds of discussions we\u2019re having with the Chinese\u201d (The Wall Street Journal, May 18). The PRC is also an increasingly important partner in technology transfer for Brazil. The two nations are pursuing a range of important joint ventures, including joint production of mid-sized business jets, the China-Brazil Earth Research Satellite (CBERS) program and other space cooperation programs (Xinhua News Agency, May 19). Brazil\u2019s expanding trade with China is also giving Brasilia reasons to become more interested in the affairs of its neighbors. In cities such as Manaus in the interior of Brazil, the economics of importing factory inputs from the PRC is greatly facilitated by routes linking the Brazilian Amazon to Pacific ports. Projects currently underway include highway corridors from the Amazon River over the Andes Mountains to the Peruvian ports of Paita and Ilo, as well as a possible multimodal corridor linking the Brazilian city of Manus, with its free trade zone, to the Ecuadorian port of Manta. In a similar fashion, Brazil\u2019s growing commerce with China also heightens its stake in the trade policy and political stability of its pacific neighbors, as well as major infrastructure projects affecting the economics of that trade such as the expansion of the Panama Canal. In addition to sustaining the caudillo socialist block and contributing to the rise of Brazil, in a broader sense, Chinese investment and aid in Latin America is undermining the primacy of the United States\u2019 role as an economic and social actor in the region. This can be seen in the re-orientation of Latin America\u2019s trade structure away from the United States, Latin American efforts to either please or avoid offending China, and in the declining power of the United States as a \u201creference model\u201d for economic development and democracy. With respect to trade structure, PRC financial deals to facilitate commerce, such as the $10.2 billion debt swap with Argentina in March 2009 (La Nacion, March 31), represent an expanding challenge to the primacy of the dollar as an international reserve currency (Nacion [Costa Rica], March 31). Brazilian President Lula explicitly argued for working with China to move away from the dollar during his trip to China in May 2009 (Xinhua News Agency, May 22). Even before such challenges to the primacy of the dollar, however, the lure of China as a market was arguably one factor that helped to permanently derail the proposed \u201cFree Trade Area of the Americas.\u201d Chinese bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile and Peru, and FTA negotiations with Costa Rica can have the effect of moving the region away from a structure of trade relationships and incentives focusing the region on the United States, to a world in which Latin American states are more independent global actors. At the individual country level, such influence can be seen in Chile, the foreign economic policy of which focuses on positioning the country as a gateway between Asia and Latin America. A similar enthusiasm can be seen in Peru, which hosted the 2008 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and in which the PRC has made important investment commitments in the oil and gas sector, purchases of fishing fleets and fishmeal processing facilities, and mines in Toromocho, Rio Blanco and Maracona. It is also evidenced in the desire of countries such as Colombia and Costa Rica to tie themselves more closely to the Pacific economic community by joining APEC. In the realm of what has been called \u201csoft power,\u201d the United States is also losing influence in the region where U.S. initiatives conflict with Latin America\u2019s desires to maintain a positive relationship with the PRC for economic reasons. The decision by the Ecuadorian regime of Rafael Correa not to renew the agreement giving the U.S. access to Manta was a necessary step in inviting the Chinese to develop the airport into a hub for trans-pacific flights, even though the two were probably never explicitly connected by the Chinese. In the future, as Latin American regimes contemplate whether to allow potentially intrusive cooperation with U.S. law enforcement in areas such as counternarcotics, telecommunications, or banking, the impact of such cooperation on attracting investment from partners such as the Chinese will cast a growing shadow over their decisions. The desire of Latin American leaders to court, please, or avoid offending the PRC, is becoming increasingly evident. When Costa Rican President Oscar Arias switched his country\u2019s diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC in May 2007, a key factor was his belief that the emergence of the PRC as a global power made being on the \u201cright side\u201d of the China/Taiwan issue in Costa Rica\u2019s interest [3]. The importance that Latin American leaders place on China can be discerned by the number of its presidents who have led delegations to the PRC in recent years: in addition to the six trips to China by Hugo Chavez (La Estrella [Panama], April 6) and multiple trips by Rafael Correa and Evo Morales, virtually all the rest, including President Lula of Brazil, Alvaro Uribe, Felipe Calderon, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1squez, and Oscar Arias. To date, the PRC has limited its attempts to exert influence over its Latin American partners to areas tied to core Chinese interests, such as their recognition of Taiwan or Tibet, the opening of their markets to Chinese goods, and favorable or neutral positions with respect to China in forums such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Trade Organization.

The CRG is a registered non-profit organization in the province of Quebec, Canada. In addition to the Global Research websites, the Centre is involved in book publishing, support to humanitarian projects as well as educational outreach activities including the organization of public conferences and lectures.

One example pertains to Iraq in 2004 when Blackwater employees entered into the city of Fallujah and \u201cunder the pretense of looking for terrorists, [they] had carried out nighttime raids, mistreated women and children, and tortured and murdered local men and teenage boys.\u201d [4] Due to this, the local Iraqis took the law into their own hands and killed the Blackwater employees. However, whether one agrees with what the Iraqi people did or not, what occurred would have been the only justice the employees received for their crimes. It is extremely hard to investigate PMCs due to the secrecy that is guaranteed by government contracts, as well as the fact that they are not accountable to the US military and \u201creceive their orders directly from the Pentagon, and both the Department of Defense and the headquarters of the companies concerned keep their lips strictly sealed.\u201d [5] The secrecy begins with the contracts themselves where the government leaves out certain legal passages that specify exactly what the companies are supposed to do, how they are supposed to go about doing it, and if they will be held legally responsible for anything that occurs under their watch. Uesseler cites an example of this, one that should be quoted at length: DynCorp received a contract for more than a million dollars from the US State Department to organize the Iraqi criminal justice system. In June 2004, four of their employees, heavily armed and in battle gear, led Iraqi police on a raid of the former Iraqi leader in exile, Ahmed Chalabi. It is doubtful whether this action was in keeping with the spirit of the original contract. But that fact that DynCorp did not receive an official warning suggests that the contract is vague enough to allow for such \u201cviolations.\u201d [6] The fact that the contracts are so vague as to the point where companies can virtually decide what they want to do has the potential to create serious problems, one example private companies doing night raids which result in the deaths of civilians and thus aggravating the local population and whipping up anti-American sentiment. That would make the job of US solders that much harder because they would bear the brunt of the backlash, not the employees that created the situation in the first place. The situation gets worse, however, when one goes to the national levels. In the United States, no one is able to hold any private companies accountable. The parties that \u201cissue the contracts are barely capable of doing much in the way of monitoring, because, for example, they are tied down in Washington, and the state military, which would have the capabilities, has little interest in babysitting private soldiers that aren\u2019t part of its chain of command.\u201d [7] Thus the military cannot do it and Congress isn\u2019t much better as they don\u2019t allocate funds to the oversight of private companies. This allows them to \u201cexist in a state of near anarchy and arbitrariness.\u201d Private companies and their personnel are not \u201csubject to strict regulations that determine to whom they are ultimately accountable.\u201d Private corporations only have to go as far as declarations of intent in which they \u201cmaintain that they instruct their personnel to respect national laws and international human rights standards.\u201d [8] Even if major crimes are done, the state cannot do anything as mercenaries enjoy significant protection. \u201cIn passing Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 of June 2003, the Iraqi provisional government granted exemption from prosecution to all personnel action on behalf of the coalition- including PMC employees.\u201d [9] This allows for PMCs to go about and do literally whatever they please, without fear of any consequences whatsoever and could potentially have the employees do things that they wouldn\u2019t have done so before if they were under the law, like torturing and killing civilians for example. Internationally, things have the potential to get complicated quickly. The Geneva Convention clearly distinguishes between civilians and armed combatants. However, the employees of private companies aren\u2019t civilians \u201csince they are involved in the machinery of war, are employed by governments, and frequently carry arms.\u201d Combatants are defined by the Geneva Convention \u201cas people directly and actively involved in hostilities,\u201d yet new forms of warfare muddle this definition. \u201cTo take an illustrative question: Is a private solider in Florida who presses a button launching a carpet bomb attack in Afghanistan only indirectly involved in war, while a regular soldier delivering supplies there is directly engaged in hostilities?\u201d [10] The legality issues of private soldiers need to be solved on an international level as they currently occupy a gray area in the legal system. However, the US government needs to hold these companies accountable for any crimes that their employees are involved in, if not, then situations like the one mentioned at the beginning of this topic will continue."], "id": "027a2e6c37d2170d5cc1ad90471a1072b057c1f2ea6ce1522d1b88cfc507a7fe", "highlighted_text": "In passing Coalition Provisional Authority Order , the Iraqi provisional government granted exemption from prosecution including PMC employees The legality issues of private soldiers need to be solved they currently occupy a gray area in the legal system", "highlights": [[2, 3524, 3572], [2, 3588, 3657], [2, 3710, 3733], [2, 4762, 4819], [2, 4849, 4902]], "underlines": [[2, 3524, 3572], [2, 3588, 3657], [2, 3710, 3733], [2, 4762, 4819], [2, 4849, 4902]], "emphasis": [[2, 3524, 3572], [2, 3588, 3657], [2, 3710, 3733], [2, 4762, 4819], [2, 4849, 4902]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 14], [15, 17]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2011-05-22"}, {"tag": "Biological death comes first \u2013 it forecloses the ability for their theory to take action and is a lexical pre-requisite", "cite": "Paterson 03 \u2013 Department of Philosophy, Providence College, Rhode Island (Craig, \u201cA Life Not Worth Living?\u201d, Studies in Christian Ethics, http://sce.sagepub.com)", "body": ["Contrary to those accounts, I would argue that it is death per se that is really the objective evil for us, not because it deprives us of a prospective future of overall good judged better than the alter- native of non-being.

Such an evil need not be consciously experienced in order to be an evil for the kind of being a human person is. Death is an evil because of the change in kind it brings about, a change that is destructive of the type of entity that we essentially are. Anything, whether caused naturally or caused by human intervention (intentional or unintentional) that drastically interferes in the process of maintaining the person in existence is an objective evil for the person. What is crucially at stake here, and is dialectically supportive of the self-evidency of the basic good of human life, is that death is a radical interference with the current life process of the kind of being that we are. In consequence, death itself can be credibly thought of as a \u2018primitive evil\u2019 for all persons, regardless of the extent to which they are currently or prospectively capable of participating in a full array of the goods of life.81  In conclusion, concerning willed human actions, it is justifiable to state that any intentional rejection of human life itself cannot therefore be warranted since it is an expression of an ultimate disvalue for the subject, namely, the destruction of the present person; a radical ontological good that we cannot begin to weigh objectively against the travails of life in a rational manner.

Such factors may well play a role in motivating aggression or in serving as a means for generating fear and manipulating public opinion. The reality, however, is that while some of these may have more potential to contribute to war than others, there may well be an infinite set of motivating factors, or human wants, motivating aggression. It is not the independent existence of such motivating factors for war but rather the circumstances permitting or encouraging high risk decisions leading to war that is the key to more effectively controlling war. And the same may also be true of democide. The early focus in the Rwanda slaughter on \"ethnic conflict,\" as though Hutus and Tutsis had begun to slaughter each other through spontaneous combustion, distracted our attention from the reality that a nondemocratic Hutu regime had carefully planned and orchestrated a genocide against Rwandan Tutsis as well as its Hutu opponents.I1 Certainly if we were able to press a button and end poverty, racism, religious intolerance, injustice, and endless disputes, we would want to do so.

In fact, realist theory can hardly be recognized in the feminist caricature of it. Take the idea of the innate human propensity for conflict. Although some realist thinkers such as Hans Morgenthau have confused the matter (often under the influence of Reinhold Niebuhr) with misleading talk of \"original sin,\" the controlling idea of realism is that there is an ineradicable potential for conflict between human beings--\"men\" in the inclusive, gender-neutral sense-- when they are organized in groups. Realism is not about conflict between individual men, that is, males; if it were, it would be a theory of barroom brawls or adolescent male crime. It is about conflict between rival communities, and those communities include women and men alike. Feminist critics of realism, then, begin by attacking a straw man, or a straw male. Even worse, they tend to indulge in the stereotypes that they otherwise abhor: aggression is \"male,\" conciliation is \"female.\" To their credit, most feminist theorists are aware of this danger, ever mindful of their dogma that all sexual identity is socially constructed, ever fearful that they will hear the cry of \"Essentialist!\" raised against them. Thus Enloe, in an earlier book called Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics, struggles with how to answer what she calls \"the `What about Margaret Thatcher?' taunt.\" Her answer is that women like Margaret Thatcher and Jeane Kirkpatrick reinforce the patriarchy by making international conflict look \"less man-made, more people-made and thus more legitimate and harder to reverse.\" Enloe applies this analysis consistently--right-wing women like Phyllis Schlafly are pawns of the patriarchal-militarist power structure, while left-wing women like the Greenham Common Women are disinterested proponents of the good of humanity. Still, Enloe is troubled enough to return to the question: \"some women's class aspirations and their racist fears lured them into the role of controlling other women for the sake of imperial rule.\" Admit that, however, and you are close to conceding the point about collective human behavior made by realists. Then there is \"the state.\" Here, too, there is nothing in realism that cannot accommodate many feminine observations about the particular patriarchal features of particular historic states. The realist definition of \"the state\" as a sovereign entity with an existence and a strategy distinct from that of individuals is very broad, including medieval duchies and ancient empires-- and, perhaps, female biker gangs. Realist theory holds no preference for the modern nation-state, though a word might be spoken in its defense. Again and again in feminist writings one encounters the claim that the modern nation- state is inherently \"gendered,\" as though its predecessors--feudal dynastic regimes, theocratic empires, city-states, tribal amphictyonies--were not even more rigidly patriarchal. Completely missing from such an analysis is any acknowledgement that the successes of feminism have been largely based on appeals to the universal norms governing citizens of the impersonal, bureaucratic nation-state. Those appeals would have made no sense in any previous political system. Notwithstanding this, feminist scholars tend to join free marketeers, multiculturalists and Wilsonians in their approval of the (mostly imaginary) dissolution of the nation-state in a new world order. If the nation-state is \"gendered,\" Enloe reasons, then perhaps the post-national nonstate need not be: \"Perhaps effective u.n. soldiering will call for a new kind of masculinity, one less reliant on misogyny, less insecure about heterosexual credentials.\" (If the recent \"peacekeeping\" of u.n. forces in Bosnia and Somalia shows anything, however, it is that a little more of the old masculinity may be necessary to prevent mass slaughter--and mass rape, too.) Though realist theory can survive, and perhaps even accommodate, many of the arguments of feminism with respect to collective conflict and state sovereignty, realism must reject the third aspect of the feminist criticism: the redefinition of security to mean social justice. From the Marxist left, feminists have picked up the argument that interstate violence is just one genre of \"structural violence,\" which includes the economic oppression of lower classes by upper classes (Marxism) and the subordination of women to men by custom and by violence (feminism). But this notion merely disguises a change of subject as a change of approach. To say that mass rape by soldiers in wartime and wife-beating in societies at peace (excuse me, at \"peace\") are parts of the same phenomenon is to abandon any pretense of engaging in serious thinking about international relations. The result may be feminist theory, but it is not a theory of world politics. It is a theory of human society in general. When, as in \"ecofeminism,\" the mistreatment of women by men in all societies, in peace and at war, is fused, as a subject of analysis, with the mistreatment of the ecosystem by humanity, one has a theory of everything, and a theory of everything is usually not very much. If you don't know where you are going, as the old saw has it, any road will get you there. Hence Enloe's decision to understand the Gulf war by beginning with the experiences of Filipina maids in Kuwait. \"I might get back to George Bush, Fran\ufffdois Mitterrand, King Fahd and Saddam Hussein eventually.\" Or maybe not. The results of combining an abandonment of the idea of international politics as something that can be understood by abstracting certain aspects of reality from the blooming, buzzing confusion of fact with an abandonment of a \"positivist\" effort to establish chains of causation are amply on display in The Morning After, as in the earlier Bananas, Beaches and Bases. These rambling exercises in free association have less in common with a monograph on a diplomatic or military subject than with the associative and politicized writings of, say, Adrienne Rich; they amount to a compendium of vignettes linked only by vague humanitarian sentiment and the writer's consciousness. Enloe is grandiose in her employment of \"I\": \"I've become aware now of the ways in which men have used nationalism to silence women....\" \"Those like myself who believe that militarism is separable from masculinity are especially interested in conscription....\" \"For instance, I realize now that I know nothing--nothing--about Kurdish women.\" (Such personal observations, one must admit, are refreshing compared to sentences like these: \"Sexual practice is one of the sites of masculinity's--and femininity's--daily construction. That construction is international. It has been so for generations.\" Or: \"Thinking about militarism in this way reminds us that we all can be militarized, as girlfriends, fathers, factory workers or candidates.\") Resolutely ignoring the world of high politics--dictators, presidents, chanceries, general staffs--Enloe devotes attention to various feminist political groupuscles far out of proportion to their actual significance in shaping events. Thus she dwells on a Serbian women's party that \"called for respect for cultural diversity within Yugoslavia.\" She salutes Danish women for voting against Maastricht and coalitiian women for working to depose the Shah. \"Women Against Fundamentalism is a group formed in Britain by women who included Jews, Arab and Asian Muslims, Hindus, white and Afro-Caribbean Protestants and Irish Catholics. It was formed in 1989, in the turbulently gendered wake of the threats against Salman Rushdie's life....\" \"The first National Conference of Nicaraguan Women was held in January 1992....\" This recurrent focus on little sisterhoods, mobilizing against \"gendered\" nation-states, multinational capitalism and racial and religious prejudice, owes a lot to the Marxist dream of a transnational fraternity of workers (in a new form, as a transnational sorority of feminists) and even more to the hope of early twentieth-century peace crusaders such as Jane Addams that the women of the world can unite and put an end to war and exploitation. Enloe tries to justify the attention paid to quite different groups of women in various countries with the claim that \"no national movement can be militarized\"--or demilitarized?--\"without changing the ways in which femininity and masculinity infuse daily life.\" Even if \"militarization,\" however defined, does result in certain kinds of gender relations, it does not follow that altering masculine and feminine roles will, in itself, do much to reverse the process. Something may, after all, be an effect without being a cause. Rejecting the feminist approach to international relations does not mean rejecting the subjects or the political values of feminist scholars. Differing notions of masculinity and femininity in different societies, the treatment of women and homosexuals of both sexes in the armed forces, the exploitation of prostitutes by American soldiers deployed abroad, the sexual division of labor both in advanced and developing countries: all of these are important topics that deserve the attention that Enloe awards them. She shows journalistic flair as well as scholarly insight in detailing what abstractions like the Caribbean Basin Initiative mean in the lives of women in particular Third World countries. Still, such case studies, however interesting, do not support the claim of feminist international relations theorists that theirs is a new and superior approach. One thing should be clear: commitment to a feminist political agenda need not entail commitment to a radical epistemological agenda. Ideas do not have genders, just as they do not have races or classes. In a century in which physics has been denounced as \"Jewish\" and biology denounced as \"bourgeois,\" it should be embarrassing to denounce the study of international relations as \"masculinist.\" Such a denunciation, of course, will not have serious consequences in politics, but it does violence to the life of the mind. The feminist enemies of empiricism would be well-advised to heed their own counsel and study war no more.", ""], "id": "e9bc197b0656cd131bcbb303f511eecaf4db51561c03db0648c72ccd3c0ff6a8", "highlighted_text": "the feminist critique of realism is by no means incompatible with realism Realism is not about individual men It is about conflict in feminist writings one encounters the claim that the modern nation- state is inherently \"gendered, the successes of feminism have been largely based on appeals to the bureaucratic nation-state Rejecting the feminist approach to international relations does not mean rejecting values of feminist scholars", "highlights": [[2, 40, 43], [2, 44, 75], [2, 87, 124], [2, 649, 669], [2, 687, 701], [2, 796, 801], [2, 802, 816], [2, 2847, 2947], [2, 3166, 3233], [2, 3288, 3313], [2, 8846, 8928], [2, 8959, 8977], [2, 8978, 8986]], "underlines": [[2, 40, 43], [2, 44, 75], [2, 87, 124], [2, 649, 669], [2, 670, 686], [2, 687, 701], [2, 701, 702], [2, 796, 801], [2, 802, 816], [2, 817, 894], [2, 1337, 1342], [2, 1447, 1748], [2, 1793, 1919], [2, 1920, 1928], [2, 1929, 1994], [2, 2194, 2204], [2, 2215, 2332], [2, 2496, 2720], [2, 2847, 2947], [2, 2947, 2975], [2, 3057, 3140], [2, 3161, 3165], [2, 3166, 3233], [2, 3288, 3313], [2, 3313, 3314], [2, 5316, 5553], [2, 5554, 5562], [2, 5563, 5951], [2, 7051, 7097], [2, 7150, 7203], [2, 7204, 7215], [2, 7216, 7284], [2, 7869, 8017], [2, 8846, 8928], [2, 8929, 8958], [2, 8959, 8977], [2, 8978, 8986], [2, 8986, 8987]], "emphasis": [[2, 40, 43]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2005-01-01"}, {"tag": "Russia fills in", "cite": "Barmin 18 Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

", "body": ["Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to power in Russia in 2012 signified a dramatic change in the country\u2019s foreign policy and military strategy. Scrapping the achievements of the Dmitry Medvedev era in the Kremlin, which was characterized by a thaw in relations with the West, Vladimir Putin opted for a more aggressive approach toward positioning the country in the international arena. Experts still argue what prompted this review of the country\u2019s foreign policy strategy, but the developments that likely had a major impact on Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy planning in 2012 included the war with Georgia in 2008, the Arab Spring protests, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) infamous military campaign in Libya, which brought down Russia\u2019s long-time ally Muammar Qaddafi. Contours of the new policy approach to the region started to emerge when Russia updated two of its key documents, the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation and the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.[i] The documents pronounced strategies based on protecting Russian national interests abroad, including militarily if need be, and increasing Moscow\u2019s role in maintaining global security. Quite notably, a more recent edition of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, signed by President Putin in November 2016, has a specific focus on the Middle East and names foreign meddling there as one of the causes of instability and extremism in the region that directly affect Russia.[ii] The statement that serves as de facto justification for the Russian military campaign in Syria became the first official document to elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East and North Africa. In the three years that divide the two concepts, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to foreign policy experienced an evolution and increasing securitization (the word \u201cterrorism\u201d figures 15 times in the 2013 Concept and 35 in its 2016 edition). The Foreign Policy Concept also spells out the Russian president\u2019s growing ambition to deal with instability where it originates before it reaches Russian borders. The rationale behind Russia\u2019s re-emergence as one of the leading powers in the Middle East was of a defensive nature and largely reactionary. The Arab Spring movement in the region was a painful reminder of the Color Revolutions that broke out across several post-Soviet states in the first half of the 2000s and, according to the Kremlin, led to the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself is of the belief that that the Arab Spring is a continuation of those Color Revolutions and that both are foreign-instigated.[iii] Coupled with a forced revolution in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi in what Russia declared was a violation of international law, this episode is often cited as a watershed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking.[iv] A wave of revolutions across Eurasia convinced the Russian leadership that the apparent domino effect of regime change would eventually target Russia. It is not a coincidence that the Russian president likens Color Revolutions and the Arab Spring protests to each other and often makes no distinction between them. Commenting on anti-corruption protests in Russia in March 2017, he went as far as to call them \u201can instrument of the Arab Spring.\u201d[v] Vladimir Putin sees Russia as a legitimate actor in designing a new power balance in the Middle East and as its integral part since security challenges originating in the region reverberate across the former Soviet space as well as in Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is an outsider in this region in the view of Russian officials. Criticism of the White House over its \u201cdestructive\u201d role in the Middle East is a central theme of many of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speeches, including the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly prior to launching his military campaign in Syria in September 2015. In those remarks, the Russian president accused the United States of being the source of problems in the Middle East.[vi] A gradual withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East under Barack Obama among other things meant that the region\u2019s \u201cpoliceman\u201d was no longer interested in maintaining order there, which arguably presented Moscow with numerous security challenges. Russia\u2019s re-emergence in the Middle East to a large extent happened to fill some of the void left by the retreating Obama administration. In some cases it happened effortlessly, such as in Egypt, where the US decision to cut aid to Cairo in 2013 led to the emergence of a budding Russia-Egypt alliance. In other contexts, most prominently in Syria, Russia had to invest significant diplomatic and military resources to marginalize the US in the war and in the peace process. What started out as an attempt to replace the United States where it was no longer interested in playing a leading role later transformed into an ambition to challenge the US even where it had no intention of retreating, for instance in the Gulf region. Russia\u2019s return to the Middle East differs from the Soviet experience: Today, Moscow is extending its reach without the baggage of Soviet ideology. The idea of using its arms exports to the Middle East in the ideological struggle against the West evaporated as soon as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) disintegrated and was replaced with the idea of making a profit for the cash-strapped budget. The Kremlin is looking to support its geopolitical claims with a strong pragmatic dimension. In the Middle East, Moscow to reinforce its influence there as well as offset the burden upon the Russian federal budget associated with the expenses of the Syrian campaign. Following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, Russia has used arms deals to reach out to Cold War\u2013era allies in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance. During the Cold War, Wynfred Joshua and Stephen P. Gilbert wrote that as more countries became recipients of Soviet military aid programs, there was a tendency for these countries to become greater political allies of the Soviet Union.[vii] And it seems that this argument is increasingly relevant today. According to SIPRI, in 2015 $5.5 billion in Russian arms exports were destined for clients in the Middle East, which was ten times more than all Russian experts to the region for all of the 1990s.[viii] With Vladimir Putin declaring victory over the Islamic State during his December 2017 visit to Syria, Russia is faced with a number of opportunities as well as challenges. Its military operation in Syria may have put Russia back on the radar in the Middle East; but in all certainty, it essentially solidified its position in the region. As Vladimir Putin is eyeing re-election as president in March 2018, foreign policy achievements, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, figure prominently in his election campaign rhetoric. One of the effects of Russia\u2019s assertive foreign policy has become an expectation from regional partners and opponents alike that Moscow will be active in the Middle East. However, the hard power that brought Russia to prominence in the region will not be a helpful tool to support long-term influence there and could, in fact, produce a negative impact for Russia\u2019s international standing. As a result, during his next term in office, Vladimir Putin will be faced with a challenge to depart from hard power, his preferred modus operandi, to embrace a spectrum of other tools in order to make Russia\u2019s presence in the region lasting and sustainable.", ""], "id": "d77ed070c6a926fc8058cd297a40d23dcb5aa0e57aa9bcbe073cd90f88d29de9", "highlighted_text": "Putin has a specific focus on the Middle East The statement elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East Putin sees Russia designing a new power balance in the Middle East gradual withdrawal of the United States Russia\u2019s re-emergence to fill the void Russia has used arms deals to Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria Moscow will be active in the Middle East", "highlights": [[2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 7105, 7145]], "underlines": [[2, 9, 132], [2, 1230, 1308], [2, 1309, 1328], [2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1335, 1352], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1393, 1522], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1537, 1655], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 2915, 3064], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3391, 3415], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4091, 4092], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4133, 4347], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4370, 4415], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4424, 4431], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 4441, 4484], [2, 5580, 5639], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5832, 5867], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 5897, 5931], [2, 6975, 7070], [2, 7071, 7104], [2, 7105, 7145]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [7, 9], [15, 21], [21, 22], [23, 27]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-08"}, {"tag": "Pulling out leaves the oppressed hopeless as they pray for internal reform", "cite": "Jadoon 17 (Amira Jadoon is an assistant professor at the Combating Terrorism Center and the Department of Social Sciences at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as well as the CTC\u2019s General John P.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991). Such examples provide support that the United States rarely suspends military assistance in the face of its security imperatives.

For those signing on for contractor work, many of whom are hired by private contracting firms after serving stints in the military, it is a lucrative, albeit dangerous, career path (private contractors are 2.75 times  than troops). Incredibly, while base pay for an American soldier hovers somewhere around $19,000 per year, contractors are reportedly pulling in between . The exact number of military contractors on the U.S. payroll is hard to pin down, thanks to sleight-of-hand accounting by the Department of Defense and its contractors.

It might seem obvious that human extinction would be a very bad thing, both because of the loss of potential future lives, and because of the loss of the scientific and artistic progress that we would make in the future. But the issue is at least unclear. The continuation of the human race would be a mixed bag: inevitably, it would involve both upsides and downsides. And if one regards it as much more important to avoid bad things happening than to promote good things happening then one could plausibly regard human extinction as a good thing.For example, one might regard the prevention of bads as being in general more important that the promotion of goods, as defended historically by G. E. Moore,185 and more recently by Thomas Hurka.186 One could weight the prevention of suffering as being much more important that the promotion of happiness. Or one could weight the prevention of objective bads, such as war and genocide, as being much more important than the promotion of objective goods, such as scientific and artistic progress. If the human race continues its future will inevitably involve suffering as well as happiness, and objective bads as well as objective goods. So, if one weights the bads sufficiently heavily against the goods, or if one is sufficiently pessimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to achieve good outcomes, then one will regard human extinction as a good thing.187 However, even if we believe in a moral view according to which human extinction would be a good thing, we still have strong reason to prevent near-term human extinction. To see this, we must note three points. First, we should note that the extinction of the human race is an extremely high stakes moral issue. Humanity could be around for a very long time: if humans survive as long as the median mammal species, we will last another two million years. On this estimate, the number of humans in existence in the The future, given that we don\u2019t go extinct any time soon, would be [over 20 quadrillion]. So if it is good to bring new people into existence, then it\u2019s very good to prevent human extinction. Second, human extinction is by its nature an irreversible scenario. If we continue to exist, then we always have the option of letting ourselves go extinct in the future (or, perhaps more realistically, of considerably reducing population size). But if we go extinct, then we can\u2019t magically bring ourselves back into existence at a later date. Third, we should expect ourselves to progress, morally, over the next few centuries, as we have progressed in the past. So we should expect that in a few centuries\u2019 time we will have better evidence about how to evaluate human extinction than we currently have. Given these three factors, it would be better to prevent the near-term extinction of the human race, even if we thought that the extinction of the human race would actually be a very good thing. To make this concrete, I\u2019ll give the following simple but illustrative model. Suppose that we have 0.8 credence that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 0.2 certain that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people; and the degree to which it is good to produce new people, if it is good, is the same as the degree to which it is bad to produce new people, if it is bad. That is, I\u2019m supposing, for simplicity, that we know that one new life has one unit of value; we just don\u2019t know whether that unit is positive or negative. And let\u2019s use our estimate of 2\u00d710^14 people who would exist in the future, if we avoid near-term human extinction. Given our stipulated credences, the expected benefit of letting the human race go extinct now would be (.8-.2)\u00d7(2\u00d710^14) = 1.2\u00d7(10^14). Suppose that, if we let the human race continue and did research for 300 years, we would know for certain whether or not additional people are of positive or negative value. If so, then with the credences above we should think it 80% likely that we will find out that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 20% likely that we will find out that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people. So there\u2019s an 80% chance of a loss of 3\u00d7(10^10) (because of the delay of letting the human race go extinct), the expected value of which is 2.4\u00d7(10^10). But there\u2019s also a 20% chance of a gain of 2\u00d7(10^14), the expected value of which is 4\u00d7(10^13). That is, in expected value terms, the cost of waiting for a few hundred years is vanishingly small compared with the benefit of keeping one\u2019s options open while one gains new information.", ""], "id": "02d1b964e21807901c794cfcf89023ad6d7d3783d8ca84d5a382222e4a1c8948", "highlighted_text": "The human race might go extinct asteroids, supervolcanoes , climate change all pose risks human extinction would be bad because of the loss of potential future lives, and the loss of the scientific progress that we would make we have strong reason to prevent near-term extinction .

One reason for this is that a lot of scholarship on disasters is practically oriented, for obvious reasons, and the social sciences have a deep-seated suspicion of practical work. This is especially true in sociology. Tierney (2007b) has treated this topic at length, so there is no reason to repeat the point here. There is another, somewhat unappreciated reason that work on disaster is seen as narrow, a reason that holds some irony for the main thrust of my argument here: disasters are unusual and the social sciences are generally biased toward phenomena that are frequent. Methods textbooks caution against using case stud- ies as representative of anything, and articles in mainstreams journals that are not based on probability samples must issue similar obligatory caveats. The premise, itself narrow, is that the only way to be certain that we know something about the social world, and the only way to control for subjective influences in data acquisition, is to follow the tenets of probabilistic sampling. This view is a correlate of the central way of defining rational action and rational policy in academic work of all varieties and also in much practical work, which is to say in terms of probabilities. The irony is that probabilistic thinking has its own biases, which, if unacknowledged and uncorrected for, lead to a conceptual neglect of extreme events. This leaves us, as scholars, paying attention to disasters only when they happen and doing that makes the accumulation of good ideas about disaster vulnerable to issue-attention cycles (Birkland, 2007). These conceptual blinders lead to a neglect of disasters as \"strategic research sites\" (Merton, 1987), which results in learning less about disaster than we could and in missing opportunities to use disaster to learn about society (cf. Sorokin, 1942). We need new conceptual tools because of an upward trend in frequency and severity of disaster since 1970 (Perrow, 2007), and because of a growing intellectual attention to the idea of worst cases (Clarke, 2006b; Clarke, in press). For instance, the chief scientist in charge of studying earthquakes for the US Geological Service, Lucile Jones, has worked on the combination of events that could happen in California that would constitute a \"give up scenario\": a very long-shaking earthquake in southern California just when the Santa Anna winds are making everything dry and likely to burn. In such conditions, meaningful response to the fires would be impossible and recovery would take an extraordinarily long time. There are other similar pockets of scholarly interest in extreme events, some spurred by September 11 and many catalyzed by Katrina. The consequences of disasters are also becoming more severe, both in terms of lives lost and property damaged. People and their places are becoming more vulnerable. The most important reason that vulnerabilities are increasing is population concentration (Clarke, 2006b). This is a general phenomenon and includes, for example, flying in jumbo jets, working in tall buildings, and attending events in large capacity sports arenas. Considering disasters whose origin is a natural hazard, the specific cause of increased vulnerability is that people are moving to where hazards originate, and most especially to where the water is. In some places, this makes them vulnerable to hurricanes that can create devastating storm surges; in others it makes them vulnerable to earthquakes that can create tsunamis. In any case, the general problem is that people concentrate themselves in dangerous places, so when the hazard comes disasters are intensified. More than one-half of Florida's population lives within 20 miles of the sea. Additionally, Florida's population grows every year, along with increasing development along the coasts. The risk of exposure to a devastating hurricane is obviously high in Florida. No one should be surprised if during the next hurricane season Florida becomes the scene of great tragedy. The demographic pressures and attendant development are wide- spread. People are concentrating along the coasts of the United States, and, like Florida, this puts people at risk of water-related hazards. Or consider the Pacific Rim, the coastline down the west coasts of North and South America, south to Oceania, and then up the eastern coast- line of Asia. There the hazards are particularly threatening. Maps of population concentration around the Pacific Rim should be seen as target maps, because along those shorelines are some of the most active tectonic plates in the world. The 2004 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, which killed at least 250,000 people, demonstrated the kind of damage that issues from the movement of tectonic plates. (Few in the United States recognize that there is a subduction zone just off the coast of Oregon and Washington that is quite similar to the one in Indonesia.) Additionally, volcanoes reside atop the meeting of tectonic plates; the typhoons that originate in the Pacific Ocean generate furiously fatal winds. Perrow (2007) has generalized the point about concentration, arguing not only that we increase vulnerabilities by increasing the breadth and depth of exposure to hazards but also by concentrating industrial facilities with catastrophic potential. Some of Perrow's most important examples concern chemical production facilities. These are facilities that bring together in a single place multiple stages of production used in the production of toxic substances. Key to Perrow's argument is that there is no technically necessary reason for such concentration, although there may be good economic reasons for it. The general point is that we can expect more disasters, whether their origins are \"natural\" or \"technological.\" We can also expect more death and destruction from them. I predict we will continue to be poorly prepared to deal with disaster. People around the world were appalled with the incompetence of America's leaders and orga- nizations in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Day after day we watched people suffering unnecessarily. Leaders were slow to grasp the importance of the event. With a few notable exceptions, organi- zations lumbered to a late rescue. Setting aside our moral reaction to the official neglect, perhaps we ought to ask why we should have expected a competent response at all? Are US leaders and organiza- tions particularly attuned to the suffering of people in disasters? Is the political economy of the United States organized so that people, espe- cially poor people, are attended to quickly and effectively in noncri- sis situations? The answers to these questions are obvious. If social systems are not arranged to ensure people's well-being in normal times, there is no good reason to expect them to be so inclined in disastrous times. Still, if we are ever going to be reasonably well prepared to avoid or respond to the next Katrina-like event, we need to identify the barriers to effective thinking about, and effective response to, disasters. One of those barriers is that we do not have a set of concepts that would help us think rigorously about out-sized events. The chief toolkit of concepts that we have for thinking about important social events comes from probability theory. There are good reasons for this, as probability theory has obviously served social research well. Still, the toolkit is incomplete when it comes to extreme events, especially when it is used as a base whence to make normative judgments about what people, organizations, and governments should and should not do. As a complement to probabilistic thinking I propose that we need possibilistic thinking. In this paper I explicate the notion of possibilistic thinking. I first discuss the equation of probabilism with rationality in scholarly thought, followed by a section that shows the ubiquity of possibilis- tic thinking in everyday life. Demonstrating the latter will provide an opportunity to explore the limits of the probabilistic approach: that possibilistic thinking is widespread suggests it could be used more rigorously in social research.

This is why, from the standpoint of politics\u2014as opposed to religion\u2014pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with \u201cgood\u201d may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of \u201cgood\u201d that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one\u2019s goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways.

Rather, death in itself is an evil to us because it ontologically destroys the current existent subject \u2014 it is the ultimate in metaphysical lightening strikes.80 The evil of death is truly an ontological evil borne by the person who already exists, independently of calculations about better or worse possible lives. Such an evil need not be consciously experienced in order to be an evil for the kind of being a human person is. Death is an evil because of the change in kind it brings about, a change that is destructive of the type of entity that we essentially are. Anything, whether caused naturally or caused by human intervention (intentional or unintentional) that drastically interferes in the process of maintaining the person in existence is an objective evil for the person. What is crucially at stake here, and is dialectically supportive of the self-evidency of the basic good of human life, is that death is a radical interference with the current life process of the kind of being that we are. In consequence, death itself can be credibly thought of as a \u2018primitive evil\u2019 for all persons, regardless of the extent to which they are currently or prospectively capable of participating in a full array of the goods of life.81  In conclusion, concerning willed human actions, it is justifiable to state that any intentional rejection of human life itself cannot therefore be warranted since it is an expression of an ultimate disvalue for the subject, namely, the destruction of the present person; a radical ontological good that we cannot begin to weigh objectively against the travails of life in a rational manner. To deal with the sources of disvalue (pain, suffering, etc.) we should not seek to irrationally destroy the person, the very source and condition of all human possibility.82 "], "id": "9768d6ef62f2a04ef107a5f5b90dc257dc5277e5510f48fac58a0f29afe5c433", "highlighted_text": "death is evil not because it deprives us of a future Rather, death in itself is evil because it ontologically destroys the subject independently of calculations about better or worse possible lives.

We also employ a set of control variables derived from prior research on human rights (Poe and Tate 1994; Poe at al. 1999) including: (1) level of democracy; (2) per capita GNP; (3) logged population; (4) leftist government dummy variable; (5) military dictatorship dummy variable; (6) British colonial influence; (7) involvement in international war; (8) involvement in civil war; (9) organized nonviolent rebellion; and (10) organized violent rebellion. The results are available upon request. Here we simply describe the relationships we find between the use of force and human rights. We use three different measures of the US use of force. The first is measured simply as the occurrence of any US use of military force. The second is measured as a major level US use of force. The third is measured as a use of military force involving deployment of US ground forces. We employ the latter two variables to determine if a stronger commitment of the US military is needed to affect human rights. Major military actions are those that involve multiple units of air, land and/or sea forces that would be expected to provide a more visible and assertive US military presence. We would also expect that in instances where presidents ordered the deployment of US ground forces that the US government would possess greater leverage over the policies of the target regime. Ground forces are in a much stronger position to affect change in a target country when they are used to secure a peace, patrol, and protect lives and property. Therefore, we expect that the more force used and the deployment of ground forces would be more associated with an increase in the protection of human rights, Each of these three, binary variables was lagged one-year, two-years and three-years to determine the length of time needed for force to actually influence, if at all, respect for human rights. The effects of the three measures of uses of force on human rights are largely negligible. In the first set of measures we examined the effects of all uses of force irrespective of size or type. Regardless of how many years we lag the occurrence of a use of force(to allow time for human rights practices to change within a country), the coefficients for the use of force variables never attain statistical significance. Interestingly, the coeffects at two- and three-year lags are positive. The impact of uses of force would appear to change over time. At first, the use of force may lead to an increase in respect for human rights, but later and perhaps after US forces have departed the scene, the target nation experiences increasing violations. One could imagine several possible scenarios associated with a use of force. If US forces have left the target nation, that regime may be returning to its previous and poor human rights policies, which may have triggered the use of force. Whatever positive influence US military forces may have on human rights may depend entirely on their continuing presence.

SHS TG", "body": ["Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to power in Russia in 2012 signified a dramatic change in the country\u2019s foreign policy and military strategy. Scrapping the achievements of the Dmitry Medvedev era in the Kremlin, which was characterized by a thaw in relations with the West, Vladimir Putin opted for a more aggressive approach toward positioning the country in the international arena. Experts still argue what prompted this review of the country\u2019s foreign policy strategy, but the developments that likely had a major impact on Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy planning in 2012 included the war with Georgia in 2008, the Arab Spring protests, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) infamous military campaign in Libya, which brought down Russia\u2019s long-time ally Muammar Qaddafi. Contours of the new policy approach to the region started to emerge when Russia updated two of its key documents, the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation and the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.[i] The documents pronounced strategies based on protecting Russian national interests abroad, including militarily if need be, and increasing Moscow\u2019s role in maintaining global security. Quite notably, a more recent edition of the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, signed by President Putin in November 2016, has a specific focus on the Middle East and names foreign meddling there as one of the causes of instability and extremism in the region that directly affect Russia.[ii] The statement that serves as de facto justification for the Russian military campaign in Syria became the first official document to elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East and North Africa. In the three years that divide the two concepts, Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to foreign policy experienced an evolution and increasing securitization (the word \u201cterrorism\u201d figures 15 times in the 2013 Concept and 35 in its 2016 edition). The Foreign Policy Concept also spells out the Russian president\u2019s growing ambition to deal with instability where it originates before it reaches Russian borders. The rationale behind Russia\u2019s re-emergence as one of the leading powers in the Middle East was of a defensive nature and largely reactionary. The Arab Spring movement in the region was a painful reminder of the Color Revolutions that broke out across several post-Soviet states in the first half of the 2000s and, according to the Kremlin, led to the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself is of the belief that that the Arab Spring is a continuation of those Color Revolutions and that both are foreign-instigated.[iii] Coupled with a forced revolution in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi in what Russia declared was a violation of international law, this episode is often cited as a watershed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking.[iv] A wave of revolutions across Eurasia convinced the Russian leadership that the apparent domino effect of regime change would eventually target Russia. It is not a coincidence that the Russian president likens Color Revolutions and the Arab Spring protests to each other and often makes no distinction between them. Commenting on anti-corruption protests in Russia in March 2017, he went as far as to call them \u201can instrument of the Arab Spring.\u201d[v] Vladimir Putin sees Russia as a legitimate actor in designing a new power balance in the Middle East and as its integral part since security challenges originating in the region reverberate across the former Soviet space as well as in Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is an outsider in this region in the view of Russian officials. Criticism of the White House over its \u201cdestructive\u201d role in the Middle East is a central theme of many of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speeches, including the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly prior to launching his military campaign in Syria in September 2015. In those remarks, the Russian president accused the United States of being the source of problems in the Middle East.[vi] A gradual withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East under Barack Obama among other things meant that the region\u2019s \u201cpoliceman\u201d was no longer interested in maintaining order there, which arguably presented Moscow with numerous security challenges. Russia\u2019s re-emergence in the Middle East to a large extent happened to fill some of the void left by the retreating Obama administration. In some cases it happened effortlessly, such as in Egypt, where the US decision to cut aid to Cairo in 2013 led to the emergence of a budding Russia-Egypt alliance. In other contexts, most prominently in Syria, Russia had to invest significant diplomatic and military resources to marginalize the US in the war and in the peace process. What started out as an attempt to replace the United States where it was no longer interested in playing a leading role later transformed into an ambition to challenge the US even where it had no intention of retreating, for instance in the Gulf region. Russia\u2019s return to the Middle East differs from the Soviet experience: Today, Moscow is extending its reach without the baggage of Soviet ideology. The idea of using its arms exports to the Middle East in the ideological struggle against the West evaporated as soon as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) disintegrated and was replaced with the idea of making a profit for the cash-strapped budget. The Kremlin is looking to support its geopolitical claims with a strong pragmatic dimension. In the Middle East, Moscow to reinforce its influence there as well as offset the burden upon the Russian federal budget associated with the expenses of the Syrian campaign. Following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, Russia has used arms deals to reach out to Cold War\u2013era allies in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria to consolidate a new power balance. During the Cold War, Wynfred Joshua and Stephen P. Gilbert wrote that as more countries became recipients of Soviet military aid programs, there was a tendency for these countries to become greater political allies of the Soviet Union.[vii] And it seems that this argument is increasingly relevant today. According to SIPRI, in 2015 $5.5 billion in Russian arms exports were destined for clients in the Middle East, which was ten times more than all Russian experts to the region for all of the 1990s.[viii] With Vladimir Putin declaring victory over the Islamic State during his December 2017 visit to Syria, Russia is faced with a number of opportunities as well as challenges. Its military operation in Syria may have put Russia back on the radar in the Middle East; but in all certainty, it essentially solidified its position in the region. As Vladimir Putin is eyeing re-election as president in March 2018, foreign policy achievements, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, figure prominently in his election campaign rhetoric. One of the effects of Russia\u2019s assertive foreign policy has become an expectation from regional partners and opponents alike that Moscow will be active in the Middle East. However, the hard power that brought Russia to prominence in the region will not be a helpful tool to support long-term influence there and could, in fact, produce a negative impact for Russia\u2019s international standing. As a result, during his next term in office, Vladimir Putin will be faced with a challenge to depart from hard power, his preferred modus operandi, to embrace a spectrum of other tools in order to make Russia\u2019s presence in the region lasting and sustainable.", ""], "id": "c87f2a81a46003653cc367f6f1c55083b8bf124fd78ee7ab250661c3d6e1033f", "highlighted_text": "Putin has a specific focus on the Middle East The statement elucidate the country\u2019s ambition to play a bigger role in the Middle East Putin sees Russia designing a new power balance in the Middle East gradual withdrawal of the United States Russia\u2019s re-emergence to fill the void Russia has used arms deals to Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria Moscow will be active in the Middle East", "highlights": [[2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 7105, 7145]], "underlines": [[2, 9, 132], [2, 1230, 1328], [2, 1329, 1334], [2, 1335, 1352], [2, 1353, 1392], [2, 1393, 1522], [2, 1523, 1536], [2, 1537, 1655], [2, 1656, 1729], [2, 2915, 3064], [2, 3373, 3390], [2, 3391, 3415], [2, 3416, 3464], [2, 4091, 4092], [2, 4093, 4132], [2, 4133, 4347], [2, 4348, 4369], [2, 4370, 4415], [2, 4416, 4423], [2, 4424, 4431], [2, 4432, 4440], [2, 4441, 4484], [2, 5580, 5639], [2, 5802, 5831], [2, 5832, 5867], [2, 5868, 5896], [2, 5897, 5931], [2, 6975, 7104], [2, 7105, 7145]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [7, 13], [19, 25], [25, 26], [27, 31]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-08"}, {"tag": "That spreads authoritarianism \u2013 it turns all of their offense and things get infinitely worse", "cite": "Barmin writes Yuri Barmin. 3/08/2018.

SHS TG", "body": ["Experts who had argued that authoritarianism in the Middle East would maintain stability and keep extremism at bay were proven wrong by the events of the Arab Spring.[xxxv] The Russian leadership, however, still projects its vision of \u201cautocratic stability\u201d onto the region. And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there."], "id": "3530b9b95055e741ee186856217b5a09f0cb8b1dfe86b895c4a549da87ea5ffd", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991).

So far, 2018 looks on track to be lower still. The university\u2019s Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) program found there were 10,900 terrorist attacks around the world last year, which killed a total of 26,400 people, including perpetrators. That was a drop from 2016, which was in turn a drop from 2015. Right now, the number of terrorist attacks and deaths from terrorism appears to have peaked in 2014, when there were nearly 17,000 attacks and more than 45,000 victims.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the country had foiled 13 Islamist terrorism plots and four far-right plots since March 2017, when last year\u2019s attack near the Houses of Parliament occurred. On a global scale, however, the answer is clear. Though there was a surge in terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, most attacks still occur in the Middle East and Africa, and those regions saw a big decline in 2017. The number of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa dropped by 38 percent year on year according to START; the number of victims declined by 44 percent.

In our theory, we address how a change in the security concerns of the United States in a region can lead to aid being used as a counterterrorism tool through the aforementioned channels. Once aid takes on this form, we then expect the composition of aid to shift as well. When terrorist groups either initiate or expand operations in a new region, states in that area will increase in salience to the United States (Aning, 2010; Bell, Clay & Martinez Machain, 2016). This is particularly true in the case of al-Qaeda and its affiliate groups, which explicitly aim to target the United States and its allies and pose a threat to the interests of the United States (Elworthy & Rogers, 2002; Aning, 2010). These groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations that seek independence, for example (Cronin, 2006). Thus, as al-Qaeda increases its presence in one state, the United States will have an incentive to bolster the counterterrorism efforts of not only that state, but its neighbors as well. We argue that because these terrorist groups are not necessarily identified with a particular state, but rather move into areas that provide them the opportunity to operate more freely, security concerns will have a geographical spillover effect (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). This may happen either because the United States will be concerned that the terrorists will move into neighboring countries or because the United States will find that it is most effective to fight the terrorist group by increasing the counterterrorism efforts of neighboring countries (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). Figure 1 presents the (log-scaled) relative magnitude of the different types of aid that the United States gives to sub-Saharan Africa. In the post-9/11 era, there has been a clear upward trend of increases in not only military aid, but also civil society and total development aid.6 Figure 1 about here These trends are reflective of the increased prominence of sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to US foreign aid allocation. We will begin by focusing on military aid. When foreign aid is used as a tool of counterterrorism, it is more likely to be channeled directly through to the executive branch of the recipient country, which generally controls military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement and is able to implement the preferred policies of the donor, in exchange for the resources received (Scahill, 2013). Other actors in the recipient state, such as foreign non-governmental organizations, the news media, or civil society associations that do not have control over the state\u2019s security forces clearly lack the capacity to actually carry out counterterrorism operations.7 We thus argue that when the United States wants the recipient state to engage in counterterrorism, it will give more foreign aid that takes the form of military aid that will actually carry out the counterterrorism policy. Our first hypothesis suggests that states that experience direct attacks by al-Qaeda or affiliates will receive increased military aid: Hypothesis 1: As al-Qaeda carries out attacks in a state, the recipient state will receive more military aid.", ""], "id": "8d3f5c21f0a39bf826d387403dd21e2b5ef03c089a0a39c39bd29191831f08e2", "highlighted_text": "When aid is used as a counterterrorism tool, it bolster the capabilities of a state that is fighting or to buy counterterrorism cooperation groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations the U S will have an incentive to bolster the counterterror efforts of its neighbors as well. focusing on military aid military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement the form of military aid carry out counterterror policy.", "highlights": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 48, 69], [2, 70, 122], [2, 123, 133], [2, 134, 172], [2, 173, 216], [2, 282, 438], [2, 525, 667], [2, 956, 961], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1021, 1043], [2, 1079, 1126], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1133, 1138], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1140, 1145], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1197, 1200], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1212, 1236], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 1274, 1505], [2, 2266, 2282], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2309, 2490], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 2556, 2656], [2, 2674, 2709], [2, 2871, 2938], [2, 2960, 3047], [2, 3048, 3069], [2, 3070, 3080], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3106, 3124], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3135, 3138], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3152, 3155], [2, 3156, 3163]], "emphasis": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8], [9, 15]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "Enviro", "cite": "Roberts writes David Roberts, writer on energy and climate change for Vox, formerly of Grist, citing Robert Keohane and David Victor, \u201cThe argument for incrementalism in international climate negotiations,\u201d 5/26/16, \t", "body": ["But most people (some more grudgingly and despairingly than others) are coming around to the realization that a binding global treaty just isn't in the cards, and the quest to achieve it is standing in the way of more small-scale, concrete steps.\u00b6 The clearest articulation I've seen of the latter school of thought was just published in Nature Climate Change by Robert Keohane of Princeton and David Victor of UC San Diego, in a paper entitled \"Cooperation and discord in global climate policy.\"\u00b6 It's part of a larger package of papers on \"the role of society in energy transitions,\" which is an overdue focus for academic attention. There's tons of great stuff in it, but it's all behind a paywall, which is really a damn shame. So I'll just briefly summarize the Keohane-Victor argument.\u00b6 The structure of climate change resists collective action\u00b6 Climate change is a global commons problem. The costs of action are localized, but the benefits accrue globally, over long time periods. A safe climate is a public good, and \"public goods are typically underprovided in the absence of a governing authority,\" write Keohane and Victor, \"because each actor has an incentive to free-ride \u2014 to gain a beneficial climate while failing to pay its share.\"\u00b6 Because of this malign incentive structure, it has proven extremely difficult to achieve the deep cooperation that will be required to solve the problem. To get beyond shallow coordination requires more trust, reciprocity, and international governing authority than currently exists.\u00b6 Coordination is easy, cooperation is hard\u00b6 Keohane and Victor's analysis turns on a distinction between coordination and cooperation. They explain the distinction this way:\u00b6 Collaboration can take many forms along a continuum from coordination to cooperation. In situations of coordination, agreements are self-enforcing, that is, once an agreement has been made, the parties do not have incentives to defect from it. For instance, once everyone in the United States understands that Americans drive on the right-hand side of the road, no rational driver has an incentive to drive on the left, and vice versa for drivers in the United Kingdom. Cooperation, by contrast, is not self-enforcing. In the famous game of \u2018Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma\u2019, for instance, each player has an incentive to confess, implicating his partner in crime in return for a lighter sentence. The deep coordination needed between states to provide public goods has a similar structure.\u00b6 Moving from coordination to cooperation requires relationships of trust and institutions that can counter this incentive to free-ride, through rewards or punishments. And for a global public good like climate mitigation, the problem is particularly severe, since there are dozens of big emitters, which all have strong domestic incentives to free-ride. Success is only possible with near-universal cooperation, and there is, as yet, no central authority for global governance. (The UNFCCC itself has virtually no power to sanction or reward its members.)\u00b6 Keohane and Victor offer this simple matrix to divide international agreements into four types, based on two variables. One is whether the level of agreement is self-reinforcing (coordination) or not (cooperation). The other is the level of \"joint gains\" that could potentially be achieved through agreements. Here's a chart:\u00b6 They run through examples of international agreements that fit in all four boxes. For our purposes, the problem is that international climate action has long been stuck in the lower left box \u2014 because collaboration is relatively shallow, only a modest amount of joint gains are being achieved. Last year's US-China climate accord and the Paris agreement are good examples; both amount to codifying their respective members' national interests. There's little to push countries beyond their immediate interests, so the joint gains (in terms of climate mitigation) remain far lower than what's possible. International climate change agreements need to be lifted to the upper-left box.\u00b6 As an example of international collaboration that has made that ascent, Keohane and Victor cite trade.

There's tons of great stuff in it, but it's all behind a paywall, which is really a damn shame. So I'll just briefly summarize the Keohane-Victor argument.\u00b6 The structure of climate change resists collective action\u00b6 Climate change is a global commons problem. The costs of action are localized, but the benefits accrue globally, over long time periods. A safe climate is a public good, and \"public goods are typically underprovided in the absence of a governing authority,\" write Keohane and Victor, \"because each actor has an incentive to free-ride \u2014 to gain a beneficial climate while failing to pay its share.\"\u00b6 Because of this malign incentive structure, it has proven extremely difficult to achieve the deep cooperation that will be required to solve the problem. To get beyond shallow coordination requires more trust, reciprocity, and international governing authority than currently exists.\u00b6 Coordination is easy, cooperation is hard\u00b6 Keohane and Victor's analysis turns on a distinction between coordination and cooperation. They explain the distinction this way:\u00b6 Collaboration can take many forms along a continuum from coordination to cooperation. In situations of coordination, agreements are self-enforcing, that is, once an agreement has been made, the parties do not have incentives to defect from it. For instance, once everyone in the United States understands that Americans drive on the right-hand side of the road, no rational driver has an incentive to drive on the left, and vice versa for drivers in the United Kingdom. Cooperation, by contrast, is not self-enforcing. In the famous game of \u2018Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma\u2019, for instance, each player has an incentive to confess, implicating his partner in crime in return for a lighter sentence. The deep coordination needed between states to provide public goods has a similar structure.\u00b6 Moving from coordination to cooperation requires relationships of trust and institutions that can counter this incentive to free-ride, through rewards or punishments. And for a global public good like climate mitigation, the problem is particularly severe, since there are dozens of big emitters, which all have strong domestic incentives to free-ride. Success is only possible with near-universal cooperation, and there is, as yet, no central authority for global governance. (The UNFCCC itself has virtually no power to sanction or reward its members.)\u00b6 Keohane and Victor offer this simple matrix to divide international agreements into four types, based on two variables. One is whether the level of agreement is self-reinforcing (coordination) or not (cooperation). The other is the level of \"joint gains\" that could potentially be achieved through agreements. Here's a chart:\u00b6 They run through examples of international agreements that fit in all four boxes. For our purposes, the problem is that international climate action has long been stuck in the lower left box \u2014 because collaboration is relatively shallow, only a modest amount of joint gains are being achieved. Last year's US-China climate accord and the Paris agreement are good examples; both amount to codifying their respective members' national interests. There's little to push countries beyond their immediate interests, so the joint gains (in terms of climate mitigation) remain far lower than what's possible. International climate change agreements need to be lifted to the upper-left box.\u00b6 As an example of international collaboration that has made that ascent, Keohane and Victor cite trade. More open trade began with smaller, bi- and multi-lateral agreements to lower or remove the worst, costliest tariffs, actions clearly in participating countries' interests. As countries worked together and developed reciprocal relationships, they built up the trust needed to create institutions like the WTO, which provided a level of central governance that enabled greater cooperation and greater joint gains.\u00b6 In other words, it was not enough merely to agree on the abstract desirability of more trade.

The former movement advises women to turn away from existing means of wielding public power. Since large-scale institutions are, by definition, irredeemably patriarchal and exploitative, women are called away from existing positions of public power (Plant 1989:187). Instead, all feminists (men as well as women) are enjoined to retreat into separatist, autonomous communities. Marxist eco-feminists do not demand such hermetic exclusion, but their philosophy too calls ultimately for struggle against rather than participation within capitalist society. Since institutional science, corporations, and large public institutions are, despite radicals\u2019 fondest hopes, well entrenched, such withdrawal risks disempowering women still further. A refusal to seek positions in such imperfect institutions as presently exist would relegate women to the role of sideline critics, undermining their opportunity to be participants\u2014and indeed leaders\u2014in the ongoing restructuring of society. In its effort to avoid the appearance of cultural imperialism, radical eco-feminism also flirts with an ethical relativism that could conceivably undermine the feminist agenda at the global scale. To posit that \"[what counts as sexism, racism, or classism may vary cross-culturally\" (K. Warren r990:139) is to ignore a huge array of deeply sexist practices existing in numerous non-Western cultures. Finally, the successful realization of the radical eco-feminist dream would threaten women in a very immediate sense.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows. Other countries, which continued to receive comparable levels of military assistance or increased levels despite civilian killings, include Burma (2002\u20132006), Brazil (2005\u20132006), Guatemala (1989 and 1995), Haiti (1991\u20131994), Indonesia (1996\u20131999), Jordan (1992\u20131993), Kenya (2007\u20132009), Mali (1990\u20131992), Niger (1989\u20131990), Sri Lanka (1989\u20131991), and Uganda (1990\u20131991). Such examples provide support that the United States rarely suspends military assistance in the face of its security imperatives. The potential reverse causality between military aid and onesided violence is further discussed and tested in the empirical section of the article.", ""], "id": "411039587922cce745f35e4835d4ae0e0a8ddbf0d9042e6b2b8dfba2a793b03c", "highlighted_text": "aid decrease one-sided violence rooted in effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost capacity to conduct targeted military operations aid increases recipient\u2019s will to comply to avoid becoming victim of other coercive policies signals an alliance that enhance recipient\u2019s international standing Pakistan assist U S overthrowing Taliban regime over becoming a target counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S Governments will lose legitimacy with increased victimization and will reinforce support for rebels aid provide governments with means to maintain legitimacy while conducting security operations, and minimiz reliance on civilian targeting aid help states overcome deficiencies that necessitated violence.

The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there.", ""], "id": "1b9edfcfa3eccc500d1bbe7254244a12b1d0d747d815b018747bc4ac1d040b24", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

Riyadh's contentious policies\u2014like the war in Yemen and the rift with its neighbors\u2014have constrained its options and inadvertently reinforced Saudi Arabia's need for U.S. military and political support, including security cooperation and intelligence sharing. Prince Mohammed's legacy and perhaps even power is presently tied to two initiatives: The Yemen war and Vision 2030\u2014an ambitious program of social and economic reforms that Riyadh plans to institute to diversify its economy. Neither objective is apparently proceeding as the crown prince had hoped. And to succeed, they will likely require continued U.S. support. Until recently, President Trump was not inclined to use these developments as leverage. Instead, he stood by the crown prince even as U.S. military support to Saudi forces in Yemen\u2014including aerial refueling and advising on intelligence sharing and targeting procedures\u2014have come under attack in Congress and by international rights groups. Some have argued that the administration has emboldened Riyadh, giving it carte blanche to pursue its more assertive policies. New details pertaining to Khashoggi's murder have emerged, ostensibly tying the young Saudi monarch to the incident and leading to mounting congressional pressure. But the Trump administration has been willing to give the Saudis only a mere slap on the wrist without fundamentally altering the dynamics of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The Trump administration is unlikely to end its support for Saudi regional efforts or radically change its approach. But it could consider using its influence to encourage the Saudi leadership to moderate its assertive and damaging policies abroad. Rather than providing its assistance freely to Saudi Arabia, Washington could utilize it to extract concessions from the Saudi leadership to alter its behavior. Making U.S. support conditional to initiatives tied to Prince Mohammed's success provides Washington with a degree of sway over the brash monarch, who increasingly needs to produce a \u201cwin\u201d in light of the reputational harm the Khashoggi affair has done to the kingdom, his legacy and perhaps even his hold on power. This approach is not without risk\u2014the Saudi government could, for example, reduce intelligence sharing, or switch off the proverbial oil tap, like the OPEC states did in 1973. But 2018 is not 1973, and the United States is no longer as reliant on Saudi oil. More so, the Saudi government's assertive actions also pose operational and reputational risks to important U.S. interests, as the Khashoggi affair demonstrated, and therefore the benefits of this approach are likely to outweigh any costs Riyadh may seek to impose. On the surface, making U.S. support provisory may appear to be an unpalatable approach, one that legitimizes the crown prince. But wielded correctly, the White House can use this leverage to recalibrate the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Blanket support need not be granted in a way that emboldens Saudi behavior, leading to actions that are damaging to U.S. interests. Instead, the administration could consider also making conditional its support for the Saudi government's priority programs with the goal of altering and shaping its behavior. This includes making the Saudis take responsibility for Khashoggi's brutal death, putting an end to indiscriminate targeting practices in Yemen, altering the government's harsh response to opposition inside and outside of the Kingdom, and ending the rift with Qatar. Naysayers of such an approach might claim that it only deepens the transactionalism on which the U.S.-Saudi relationship is presently based. But it is worth recognizing that the partnership was founded on an explicit alignment of interests, not values. By acknowledging this, the United States would be better positioned to adopt an approach that best serves its own interests. At this point, the Saudi government needs U.S. support more than the White House needs Saudi Arabia.", ""], "id": "a75bd8f2ff871999fbf4bbc68d5d2304cc67639602e84039e6e1a2e00113f69d", "highlighted_text": "the U S could encourage the Saudi leadership to moderate its assertive and damaging policies Rather than providing its assistance freely to Saudi Arabia, Washington could utilize it to extract concessions from Saudi This includes making the Saudis take responsibility for Khashoggi , putting an end to indiscriminate targeting practices in Yemen, altering the government's harsh response to opposition , and ending the rift with Qatar.", "highlights": [[5, 58, 63], [5, 69, 70], [5, 1668, 1673], [5, 1706, 1784], [5, 1793, 1909], [5, 1914, 1919], [5, 3334, 3399], [5, 3414, 3533], [5, 3567, 3600]], "underlines": [[5, 0, 57], [5, 58, 63], [5, 63, 68], [5, 69, 70], [5, 70, 116], [5, 1665, 1667], [5, 1668, 1673], [5, 1706, 1784], [5, 1785, 1792], [5, 1793, 1909], [5, 1914, 1919], [5, 2942, 3333], [5, 3334, 3399], [5, 3399, 3414], [5, 3414, 3533], [5, 3567, 3600], [5, 3775, 3942], [5, 3943, 4079]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1980-01-01"}, {"tag": "They say military aid increases terror, but military aid is key to counter-terror operations.", "cite": "Heinrech writes [Tobias, University of Southern California, Carla Martinez Machain, Kansas State University, Jared Oestman, Rice University, \u201cDoes counterterrorism militarize foreign aid?

In our theory, we address how a change in the security concerns of the United States in a region can lead to aid being used as a counterterrorism tool through the aforementioned channels. Once aid takes on this form, we then expect the composition of aid to shift as well. When terrorist groups either initiate or expand operations in a new region, states in that area will increase in salience to the United States (Aning, 2010; Bell, Clay & Martinez Machain, 2016). This is particularly true in the case of al-Qaeda and its affiliate groups, which explicitly aim to target the United States and its allies and pose a threat to the interests of the United States (Elworthy & Rogers, 2002; Aning, 2010). These groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations that seek independence, for example (Cronin, 2006). Thus, as al-Qaeda increases its presence in one state, the United States will have an incentive to bolster the counterterrorism efforts of not only that state, but its neighbors as well. We argue that because these terrorist groups are not necessarily identified with a particular state, but rather move into areas that provide them the opportunity to operate more freely, security concerns will have a geographical spillover effect (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). This may happen either because the United States will be concerned that the terrorists will move into neighboring countries or because the United States will find that it is most effective to fight the terrorist group by increasing the counterterrorism efforts of neighboring countries (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). Figure 1 presents the (log-scaled) relative magnitude of the different types of aid that the United States gives to sub-Saharan Africa. In the post-9/11 era, there has been a clear upward trend of increases in not only military aid, but also civil society and total development aid.6 Figure 1 about here These trends are reflective of the increased prominence of sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to US foreign aid allocation. We will begin by focusing on military aid. When foreign aid is used as a tool of counterterrorism, it is more likely to be channeled directly through to the executive branch of the recipient country, which generally controls military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement and is able to implement the preferred policies of the donor, in exchange for the resources received (Scahill, 2013). Other actors in the recipient state, such as foreign non-governmental organizations, the news media, or civil society associations that do not have control over the state\u2019s security forces clearly lack the capacity to actually carry out counterterrorism operations.7 We thus argue that when the United States wants the recipient state to engage in counterterrorism, it will give more foreign aid that takes the form of military aid that will actually carry out the counterterrorism policy. Our first hypothesis suggests that states that experience direct attacks by al-Qaeda or affiliates will receive increased military aid: Hypothesis 1: As al-Qaeda carries out attacks in a state, the recipient state will receive more military aid."], "id": "7cb5f85e283c4cc1a07a29896bd78608f8fcbdd2593ed7885b0ee7cbe1577670", "highlighted_text": "When aid is used as a counterterrorism tool, it bolster the capabilities of a state that is fighting or to buy counterterrorism cooperation groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations the U S will have an incentive to bolster the counterterror efforts of its neighbors as well. focusing on military aid military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement the form of military aid carry out counterterror policy.", "highlights": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 48, 69], [2, 70, 122], [2, 123, 133], [2, 134, 172], [2, 173, 216], [2, 282, 438], [2, 525, 667], [2, 956, 961], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1021, 1043], [2, 1079, 1126], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1133, 1138], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1140, 1145], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1197, 1200], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1212, 1236], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 1274, 1505], [2, 2266, 2282], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2309, 2490], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 2556, 2656], [2, 2674, 2709], [2, 2871, 2938], [2, 2960, 3047], [2, 3048, 3069], [2, 3070, 3080], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3106, 3124], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3135, 3138], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3152, 3155], [2, 3156, 3163]], "emphasis": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8], [9, 15]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "Freedom violations are inevitable \u2013 imagining a world of perfection discourages material reform to ACTUALLY stop freedom violations", "cite": "Kidner 2k professor of psychology at Nottingham Trent University and internationally renowned scholar on nature-culture relationships.

Just as science has been reluctant to recognize the holistic qualities of nature, so we have been slow to appreciate that the power of industrialism and its resultant near-hegemony in the modern world is largely the result of its ability to integrate science, politics, and everyday social life within a structure that appears complete and self-sufficient. This structure cannot be challenged without reference to alternative structures. To celebrate choice and free play without also celebrating the frames of meaning within which they take place is simply to guarantee our assimilation to and absorption within industrialism, and so represents a philosophy of surrender. For example, \u201cfreedom\u201d has little meaning in the absence of a framework of democratic laws which protect the vulnerable against the \u201cfreedom\u201d of the powerful to exploit, intimidate, and mislead. Similarly, my freedom to explore an area of wilderness is negated if energy companies and off-road vehicle clubs also have the freedom to use the area as they see fit. Freedom is all to often interpreted as the absence of structure; and structure gives meaning and implies responsibilities and limitations. One of the most insidious aspects of the colonization of the world is industrialism's silent but lethal elimination of structures that could challenge it. The widespread lack of appreciation within academia of the way in which postmodern approaches involving deconstruction promote this insidious conceptual assimilation to industrialism is an index of the urgent need to develop a psychocultural dimension to our environmental understanding. Finally, we should not ignore the possibility that an emphasis on language serves particular defensive functions for the social scientist. Noam Chomsky has noted that it\u201dit's too hard to deal with real problems,\u201d some academics tend to \u201cgo off on wild goose chases that don't matter . . . [or] get involved in academic cults that are very divorced from any reality  and that provide a defense against dealing with the world as it actually is.\u201d71 An emphasis on language can serve this sort of defensive function; for the study of discourse enables one to stand aside from issues and avoid any commitment to a cause or idea, simply presenting all sides of a debate and pointing out the discursive strategies involved. As the physical world appears to fade into mere discourse, so it comes to seem less real than the language used to describe it; and environmental issues lose the dimensions of urgency and tragedy and become instead the proving grounds for ideas and attitudes. Rather than walking in what Aldo Leopold described as a \u201cworld of wounds,\u201d the discursive theorist can study this world dispassionately, safely insulated from the emotional and ecological havoc that is taking place elsewhere. Like experimentalism, this is a schizoid stance that exemplifies rather than challenges the characteristic social pathology of out time; and it is one that supports Melanie Klein's thesis that the internal object world can serve as a psychotic substitute for an external \u201creal\u201d world that is either absent or unsatisfying.72 Ian Craib's description of social construction as a \u201csocial psychosis\u201d73 therefore seems entirely apt. But what object relations theorists such as Klein fail to point out is the other side of this dialectic: that withdrawing from the external world and substituting an internal world of words or fantasies, because of the actions that follow from this state of affairs, makes the former even less satisfying and more psychologically distant, so contributing to the vicious spiral that severs the \u201chuman from the \u201cnatural\u201d and  abandons nature to industrialism.", ""], "id": "07abfd720222e58596bb926a469ba74aab62a899f2868445c3dc0f7af44ffe87", "highlighted_text": "discursive approaches limits capacity to challenge politics, and everyday social life lack of appreciation within academia promote conceptual assimilation to industrialism it's too hard to deal with real problems, academics \u201cgo off on wild goose chases that don't matter or] get involved in academic cults that are divorced from reality An emphasis on language can serve this function issues lose dimensions of urgency and tragedy the discursive theorist can study this world safely insulated from the emotional havoc that is taking place elsewhere", "highlights": [[2, 40, 68], [2, 75, 96], [2, 396, 430], [2, 1481, 1517], [2, 1585, 1592], [2, 1608, 1618], [2, 1619, 1648], [2, 1924, 1928], [2, 1929, 1965], [2, 1972, 1981], [2, 1990, 2036], [2, 2044, 2087], [2, 2093, 2106], [2, 2111, 2118], [2, 2200, 2238], [2, 2257, 2265], [2, 2617, 2628], [2, 2633, 2666], [2, 2806, 2850], [2, 2868, 2903], [2, 2919, 2955]], "underlines": [[2, 13, 39], [2, 40, 68], [2, 69, 74], [2, 75, 96], [2, 97, 135], [2, 221, 395], [2, 396, 430], [2, 431, 762], [2, 1466, 1480], [2, 1481, 1517], [2, 1518, 1584], [2, 1585, 1592], [2, 1593, 1607], [2, 1608, 1618], [2, 1619, 1648], [2, 1649, 1753], [2, 1891, 1920], [2, 1921, 1924], [2, 1924, 1928], [2, 1929, 1965], [2, 1965, 1971], [2, 1972, 1981], [2, 1982, 1989], [2, 1990, 2036], [2, 2037, 2044], [2, 2044, 2087], [2, 2088, 2092], [2, 2093, 2106], [2, 2107, 2110], [2, 2111, 2118], [2, 2120, 2196], [2, 2200, 2238], [2, 2239, 2256], [2, 2257, 2265], [2, 2265, 2266], [2, 2617, 2628], [2, 2629, 2632], [2, 2633, 2666], [2, 2806, 2850], [2, 2851, 2867], [2, 2868, 2903], [2, 2904, 2918], [2, 2919, 2955], [2, 2955, 2956]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2065-07-01"}, {"tag": "Aff causes PMC shift", "cite": "Whitehead 12.

In this way, the war on terror is privatized, the American economy is bled dry, and the military-security industrial complex makes a killing \u2014 literally and figuratively speaking. The war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan has already cost taxpayers  and could go as high as $4.4 trillion before it\u2019s all over. At least $31 billion (and as much as $60 billion or more) of that $2 trillion was  by military contractors, who do everything from janitorial and food service work to construction, security and intelligence \u2014 jobs that used to be handled by the military. That translates to a loss of  since the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan. To put it another way, the government is spending more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety.

As a result, the U.S. employs at a minimum  deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq (that number increases dramatically when U.S. troop numbers decrease). For those signing on for contractor work, many of whom are hired by private contracting firms after serving stints in the military, it is a lucrative, albeit dangerous, career path (private contractors are 2.75 times  than troops). Incredibly, while base pay for an American soldier hovers somewhere around $19,000 per year, contractors are reportedly pulling in between . The exact number of military contractors on the U.S. payroll is hard to pin down, thanks to sleight-of-hand accounting by the Department of Defense and its contractors. However, according to a Wartime Contracting Commission report released in August 2011, there are  in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than the number of ground troops . As noted, that number increases dramatically when troops are withdrawn from an area, as we currently see happening in Iraq.

Then there was the $300 million diesel power plant that was built despite the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be used regularly \u201cbecause its fuel cost more than the Afghan government could afford to run it regularly.\u201d RWA, a group of three Afghan contractors, was selected to build a 17.5 mile paved road in Ghazni province.

I argue that the effects of U.S. military aid and international development aid to states can be better understood in terms of two distinct effects on state actors\u2014persuasion and predation. U.S. military aid has a persuasion effect on state actors, which decreases states\u2019 incentives and necessity to target civilians while enhancing their capacity to identify and target rebels more precisely. In contrast, development aid flows have a predation effect on state actors. Development aid flows create adverse incentives for resource capturing in recipient states, which exacerbate conflict and governments\u2019 use of collective violence. Framing the effects as persuasion and predation is useful to draw out the causal mechanisms by which recipient states\u2019 existing motivations to target civilians interact with donors\u2019 security objectives and the effects of aid, to result in observable changes in state perpetrated civilian killings. U.S. Military aid and One-Sided Violence The United States frequently uses military aid to pressure governments in counterinsurgency efforts, and to influence the \u201cbehavior and capabilities of their partners to achieve a specific outcome.\u201d 28 I argue that military aid results in states\u2019 decreased use of one-sided violence STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 779 due to a persuasion effect. This is rooted in its effectiveness to incentivize governments as well as boost their capacity to conduct more targeted military operations. Examples from Pakistan are particularly useful in illustrating the persuasion effects of U.S. military aid. They help in drawing out theoretically how military aid can shape state actors\u2019 behavior in underdeveloped and conflict-ridden states where there is a presence of rebels that pose both a domestic and international security concern. Pakistan also represents a political environment where external states are likely to intervene through foreign aid than direct intervention. It exemplifies situations where recipient governments must balance external pressure with domestic objectives and where local militants hold strategic utility for recipient governments in proxy wars, as is the case in many ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and Africa. Given that Pakistan has been receiving U.S. military aid over an extended period of time, it\u2019s a particularly useful case to examine closely. Incentivizing Recipients In terms of incentives, provision of military aid increases a recipient\u2019s political will to comply, first in order to avoid becoming a victim of other coercive policies by the donor. Second, it signals an alliance between donors and recipients that can enhance the recipient\u2019s international standing and legitimacy. Thus, as supported by previous studies, U.S. military aid can induce governments to cooperate.29 For example, after 9/11, Pakistan opted to assist the United States in overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the alternative of becoming a target of the United States.30 Pakistan\u2019s Musharraf was portrayed as an international hero on various media outlets, with inflows of aid indicating that Pakistan was no longer a pariah state.30 Subsequently, Pakistan arrested militants on its soil especially targeting Al Qaeda and foreign fighters who posed the biggest threats to the United States32 as well as rebels that threatened the Pakistani government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). While Pakistan frequently turns a blind eye to many militant groups for its own interests, many of its counterterrorism efforts have been prompted by U.S. assistance to Pakistan\u2019s national security agencies.33 Donor-Recipient Security Objectives Additionally, where donors seek to counter nonstate actors located in another state through military assistance, there is likely to be some overlap in the security objectives of both donors and recipients. Militant groups in Pakistan pose a security threat not just to the United States and other countries, but also to Pakistan itself, which saw a 48 percent increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 2008 and 2009.34 Even though Pakistan is rightly criticized for not targeting all rebels, it\u2019s still conducting operations against rebels that have directly challenged the writ of the state such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). Therefore, the higher levels of congruence in the security objectives of donors and recipients of military aid, as far as addressing domestic security threats is concerned, is generally suggestive of a more cooperative approach. Governments that increase military operations against internal security threats have their own strong incentives to avoid use of collective punishment. Targeting civilians is likely to be counterproductive if the government has coercive objectives as opposed to brute force objectives.35 The goal of suppressing internal opposition in a state is a \u201cmoderately coercive\u201d objective implying that the state requires its target to acquiesce to prevail. It must use force persuasively to establish peace within its territorial borders especially to increase popular 780 A. JADOON support.36 This is precisely why the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan were encouraged by leaders in 2009 to exercise \u201ccourageous restraint\u201d to achieve strategic success.37 Thus, in asymmetric conflicts, information flows, collaboration, and support of civilians are key for success from a utilitarian perspective. In the absence of sufficient capability though, governments may resort to civilian targeting as a cheaper mechanism to fight guerilla warfare. Indeed, weaker governments are more likely to employ tactics of civilian targeting to undermine their opponent\u2019s capacity.38 In the Pakistan case, where the army made use of collective violence in targeting local and foreign fighters by demolishing private residences (e.g., in Operation Kalosha II), it triggered multiple attacks against army bases and enraged locals.39 Similarly, where government militias in Iraq have engaged in revenge killings, many civilians have lost trust in them and prefer the ISIS despite disagreeing with the latter\u2019s brutality and interpretation of Islam.40 Governments will lose legitimacy if their penetration is associated with increased civilian victimization and will reinforce civilian support for rebels.41 Military aid can thus provide governments with the means to maintain their legitimacy while conducting internal security operations, and offset costs associated with minimizing reliance on civilian targeting. Building Coercive Capacity Beyond enhancing incentives, U.S. military aid\u2019s persuasion effect is also rooted in its capacity effect. Military aid includes a wide variety of military support including weapons, technology, and intelligence capability. Governments use collective punishment against communities perceived to be supportive of rebel groups, or to counter guerrilla warfare that is more difficult and expensive to tackle through conventional means.42 Strategic explanations of one-sided violence argue that armed actors employ violence against civilians to change their strategic environment43 and that shifts in the capability balance between actors triggers changes in actors\u2019 tactics in war. For example, the Pakistani army relied on the use of excessive force for counterinsurgency operations where it lacked logistical and precision abilities and had shortcomings in technical intelligence.44 General Tarik Khan, who has led the fight against the TTP, has said, \u201cany kind of military operation that seeks to take out individuals is an intelligence-driven operation that requires a lot of technology, a lot of surveillance capacity.\u201d 45 As such, military aid will help states overcome the capability deficiencies that previously may have necessitated the use of collective violence. Improved counterinsurgency ability allows governments to target rebels more precisely, offset costs of increased efforts against rebels, harden soft targets and thus engage in more selective violence. U.S. military funding to Pakistan has identified priority areas such as precision strike capability, air mobility, combat search and rescue, counter improvised explosive device and survivability, battlefield communications and night operations.46 The Pakistani military has used F-16s for precise targeting of rebels in civilian areas47 and intelligence-based operations have helped the state preempt backlash against military operations in North Waziristan.48 Although, such improvements are not expected to completely eliminate the use of civilian targeting by governments, they will reduce the need to do so if governments are better able to locate legitimate targets. It should also be noted that military aid compared to development aid is less fungible, and thus less susceptible to leakage through rent-seeking behavior and corruption. And because it is provided for a specific purpose such as targeting and capturing rebels rather than being STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM 781 linked to broad development goals, its threatened withdrawal by the donor is also a more realistic threat for recipients. U.S. military aid flows can thus enhance recipient states\u2019 military capability to use force in a way, which is in line with their overall moderately coercive objectives of countering internal rebel activity. Overall, military aid not only increases the political will of governments to increase efforts against rebel strongholds, it also enhances the capacity of governments to target rebels and avoid civilian killings. This leads to the following hypothesis: H1a: Higher levels of U.S. military aid flows will be associated with lower levels of civilian killings by recipient state actors Alternatively, it may be argued that recipient governments may reduce their use of civilian targeting to ensure continued flows of U.S. military aid. This would be likely if the United States was willing to withhold aid on the basis of human rights violations or civilian killings by governments, despite its security objectives. However, prior research provides strong evidence that the United States largely provides military aid on the basis of its own national security interests, despite human rights violations within states.49 Studies have shown a lack of a relationship between recipients\u2019 human rights records and the allocation of U.S. aid or the magnitude of assistance provided.50 Indeed, Sandholtz has recently shown that U.S. military assistance in 150 countries over thirty years links with worse performance on human rights.51 Although, the Leah Law requires the United States to suspend military assistance flows in cases of civilian abuses by military units, it does not technically require an end to extrajudicial killings or a suspension of overall aid. Instead, it requires the recipient to take effective measures to hold accountable the specific military units responsible for civilian abuses. In practice, there are numerous examples where recipients have continued to receive U.S. aid despite civilian killings. In Colombia, 30,000 extrajudicial killings have been committed since 2000, but U.S. officials did not freeze its assistance under the Leah Law52 and military assistance continues at high levels. The Philippines is another case in point. The Philippines is a close U.S. ally, and received more than $507 million in U.S. military assistance between 2001\u20132010. International efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have largely been ineffective in severing aid, with aid flows rising to $30 million in 2012.53 Human rights violations by the Philippines military have not affected the regularity or scale of U.S. aid flows.

And even though Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the post-war period, the Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy movements in the Middle East. After all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia\u2019s own \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d The consolidation of power in the hands of the national leader as well as the securitization of the political agenda have characterized the Russian political system throughout the last 17 years Vladimir Putin has been in power. And they continue to guide him in how he sees regimes in the Middle East. Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain it, not least due to Moscow\u2019s financial and military support. The fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody Syrian conflict, to a large extent due to Russia\u2019s aid, solidifies the idea that authoritarianism in the Middle East guarantees stability and puts a cap on \u201ctoxic\u201d democratic values imposed from the outside. In Moscow\u2019s view, authoritarian tendencies are indigenous to the region, much like they are to Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly managed. Russia\u2019s idea of \u201cauthoritarian stability\u201d in the Middle East may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped America\u2019s agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. The distinct security focus of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy toward the region has emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical ambitions. The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus, likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.[xxxvi] In Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles critical of the government\u2019s policies. Western powers sharply rebuked Erdo\u011fan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass detentions\u2014but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world leader who gave a call to Erdo\u011fan to tell him Moscow supports his campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d[xxxvii] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup, during which Erdo\u011fan explained that Vladimir Putin\u2019s call to him was an important move, \u201ca kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey solidarity,\u201d as the Turkish president described the situation.[xxxviii] All this occurred just weeks after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s late June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 jet over Syria; and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit. Egypt is going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army\u2019s grip on power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of stability in the country. Sisi\u2019s fight to eradicate extremism in the Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt reemerged as Russia\u2019s key partner in the Middle East, including in crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and infrastructure.[xxxix] With the turmoil and regular attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least due to the military and security background of the political elites of the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdo\u011fan will almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the 2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral relations with both Cairo and Ankara. The cases of Egypt and Turkey illustrate that Vladimir Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies. Putin\u2019s support for autocratic tendencies will hardly find any resistance among other powers in the region and will almost certainly be embraced. Syria\u2019s recovery from the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of democratic institutions and freedom, but will probably lead to the creation of a strong regime with an inflated security apparatus to shield a fragile government and keep extremist tendencies at bay. Iraq\u2019s increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar trend. And as Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government fails to establish control over much of the country\u2019s territory, Libyan National Army Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar represents the type of leader the Kremlin would presumably like to see for a post\u2013civil war Libya. If Russia\u2019s Syria policy is any indication, a highly centralized system will be Moscow\u2019s remedy for extremism throughout the wider region. The fear of a new wave of extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new repressive regimes. In other words Russia\u2019s leadership in the Middle East may significantly lengthen and reinforce the era of authoritarianism there.", ""], "id": "f576331d2390f5cf99a6244752441f1292bd3ac416e1956b096a5d6d4d0a0876", "highlighted_text": "Russian leadership still projects autocratic stability\u201d onto the region Russian government is unlikely to become a supporter of democracy position of Russia is likely to resonate with governments that put on airs of liberalization Putin is likely to encourage authoritarian \u201cstability\u201d across the region through skewed security-heavy policies.

But his national security Cabinet, which now seems to be finding its feet, is in keeping with American foreign-policy traditions. In international affairs, Trump relies on two of the leading general officers of their generation, James Mattis and H.R. McMaster;\u00a0a pillar of America\u2019s globalist-corporate establishment, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson; and the former president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, who has led a so-far-successful effort to check the mercantilist instincts of White House advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro.\u00a0The internationalists have an ally in Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and key adviser, who takes a pragmatic view of U.S. policy priorities.\u00a0For all the focus on Trump\u2019s personality, his unorthodox presidency may yield a more traditional focus on deploying American power for broader ends. Obama decried American exceptionalism, emphasized \u201cnation-building at home,\u201d and pursued a dedicated policy of retracting American power\u00a0from pivotal theaters like the Middle East,\u00a0enabling revisionist regional powers to go on the offensive. He did not do enough as the humanitarian tragedy of Syria played out in slow motion, destabilizing not only the Middle East but also Europe, dividing and weakening Washington\u2019s closest ally in world affairs.\u00a0His rhetorical \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia left U.S. allies wanting more American presence and leadership than they got.\u00a0Trump\u00a0remains at odds with much of Washington\u2019s bipartisan foreign-policy establishment. He has yet to embrace the trade leadership that makes the world\u2019s biggest economy more competitive and dynamic, and Americans more prosperous. But\u00a0his willingness to employ limited military force \u2014 including ramping up military action\u00a0against the Islamic State in Syria and Afghanistan \u2014\u00a0and to stand up to the regional power plays of revisionist states, creates opportunities to more effectively manage complex conflicts, from the Levant to the Korean Peninsula. It is telling that a modest set of missile strikes against a remote Syrian airbase represents the boldest use of American military power against the murderous regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It is also telling that the tangible threat of U.S. military action against North Korea is on the table after eight years of a policy the Obama administration termed \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d which created a window of opportunity that Pyongyang used to continue to perfect its intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons programs while America looked away. Even\u00a0China and Russia look off-balance after early fears in Washington that an inexperienced president would appease the leaders of these countries. Chinese President\u00a0Xi\u00a0Jinping\u00a0came to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate\u00a0bearing concessions\u00a0designed to fend off an American trade war. At their inaugural summit, Trump was clear with Xi that the quality of U.S.-China relations would be tied to Beijing\u2019s cooperation in tightening economic pressure on North Korea. Having secured strategic gains during the Obama presidency, and given the five-year leadership plenum approaching this fall,\u00a0Xi would be wise to exercise strategic restraint during Trump\u2019s first term, and demonstrate China\u2019s utility by tightening the pressure on its ally North Korea to deter further nuclear tests. Given that Trump wants to manage trade with what he sees as a mercantilist superpower that does not play by the rules, China would also be prudent to pursue the kind of voluntary export restraint agreements that Japan struck with the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when trade frictions with Tokyo peaked.\u00a0Trump\u2019s threat to use trade barriers\u00a0as leverage to move China to assume a tougher posture with its client in Pyongyang clearly\u00a0has gotten Beijing\u2019s attention\u00a0and may even yield dividends. Ironically, Trump is likely to be the first American president since the end of the Cold War not to pursue a \u201creset\u201d in relations with Russia. The ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russian agents of influence severely restrict the ability of this administration to pursue any kind of improvement in relations with a regime that invades democratic neighbors, threatens NATO allies with nuclear attack, attempts as a matter of state policy to subvert Western elections, and murders political opponents. Indeed, the mounting domestic opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s autocratic rule \u2014 as manifested in popular protests in cities across Russia \u2014 creates a new pressure point that the United States could leverage through a heightened force posture in Europe and more robust campaign for Russia to conform to international law by severing dealings with the outlaw Syrian regime.

The theory of pluralized \u2018subject-effects\u2019 gives an illusion of undermining subjective sovereignty while often providing a cover for this subject of knowledge. Although the history of Europe as Subject is narrativized by the law, political economy, and ideology of the West, this concealed Subject pretends it has \u2018no geo-political determinations.\u2019 The much publicized critique of the sovereign subject thus actually inaugurates a Subject. . . . This S/subject, curiously sewn together into a transparency by denegations, belongs to the exploiters\u2019 side of the international division of labor. It is impossible for contemporary French intellectuals to imagine the kind of Power and Desire that would inhabit the unnamed subject of the Other of Europe. It is not only that everything they read, critical or uncritical, is caught within the debate of the production of that Other, supporting or critiquing the constitution of the Subject as Europe. It is also that, in the constitution of that Other of Europe, great care was taken to obliterate the textual ingredients with which such a subject could cathect, could occupy (invest?) its itinerary \u2014 not only by ideological and scienti\ufb01c production, but also by the institution of the law. . . . In the face of the possibility that the intellectual is complicit in the persistent constitution of Other as the Self\u2019s shadow, a possibility of political practice for the intel- lectual would be to put the economic \u2018under erasure,\u2019 to see the economic factor as irreducible as it reinscribes the social text, even as it is erased, however imperfectly, when it claims to be the \ufb01nal determinant or the transcendental signi\ufb01ed. The clearest available example of such epistemic violence is the remotely orchestrated, fareflung, and heterogeneous project to constitute the colonial subject as Other. This project is also the asymetrical obliteration of the trace of that Other in its precarious Subjectivity. It is well known that Foucault locates epistemic violence, a complete overhaul of the episteme, in the rede\ufb01nition of sanity at the end of the European eighteenth century. But what if that particular rede\ufb01nition was only a part of the narrative of history in Europe as well as in the colonies? What if the two projects of epistemic overhaul worked as dislocated and unacknowledged pans ofa vast two-handed engine? Perhaps it is no more than to ask that the subtext of the palimpsestic narra- tive of imperialism be recognized as \u2018subjugated knowledge,\u2019 \u2018a whole set of knowledges that have been disquali\ufb01ed as inadequate to their task or insuf\ufb01- ciently elaborated: naive knowledges, located low down on the hierarchy, beneath the required level of cognition or scienti\ufb01city\u2018 (Foucault I980: 82). This is not to describe \u2018the way things really were\u2019 or to privilege the narrative of history as imperialism as the best version of history. It is, rather, to offer an account of how an explanation and narrative of reality was established as the normative one. . . . Let us now move to consider the margins (one can just as well say the silent, silenced center) of the circuit marked out by this epistemic violence, men and women among the illiterate peasantry, the tribals, the lowest strata of the urban subproletariat. According to Foucault and Deleuze (in the First World, under the standardization and regimentation of socialized capital, though they do not seem to recognize this) the oppressed, if given the chance (the problem of representation cannot be bypassed here), and on the way to solidarity through alliance politics (a Marxist thematic is at work here) can speak and know their conditions. We must now confront the following question: On the other side of the international division of labor from socialized capital, inside and outside the circuit of the epistemic violence of imperialist law and education supplementing an earlier economic text, can the subaltern speak? . . .

Originating in the psychological literature, the term can be misleading in a non-clinical context, and indeed many people who favor such warnings prefer to call them \u201ccontent warnings\u201d for that reason. It\u2019s not just trauma survivors who may be distracted or derailed by shocking or troubling material, after all. It\u2019s any of us, and a significant part of the distraction comes not from the material itself but from the context in which it\u2019s presented. In the original cut of the 1933 version of the film \"King Kong,\" there was a scene (depicting an attack by a giant spider) that was so graphic that the director removed it before release. He took it out, it\u2019s said, not because of concerns about excessive violence, but because the intensity of the scene ruined the movie \u2014 once you saw the sailors get eaten by the spider, the rest of the film passed by you in a haze. A similar concern provides a big part of the impetus for content warnings. These warnings prepare the reader for what\u2019s coming, so their attention isn\u2019t hijacked when it arrives. Even a pleasant surprise can be distracting, and if the surprise is unpleasant the distraction will be that much more severe. I write quite a bit online, and I hardly ever use content warnings myself. I respect the impulse to provide them, but in my experience a well-written title and lead paragraph can usually do the job more effectively and less obtrusively.

The importance of the discursive struggles over the standards that distinguish legitimate and illegitimate forms of expression has also eluded thorough analysis. Critical theorists must recognize the practical discursive struggles of social agents. The actual symbolic practices of agents must be understood if we are to analyze how logical types become invested with authority. The establishment of authority may preclude participation in the field and marginalize those who could or should have a say. Field theory is better conceptualized by considering argument fields as social arenas of struggle, accounting for the key elements and factors that make fields dynamic. Toulmin, while recognizing the role of argumentative conflict in the establishment of authority, originally employed an evolutionary model in his explanation of the development of disciplinary fields. In Human Understanding, he argues that forums of competition allow the best warrants of a field to become accepted. The dominant war rants, he believes, did not develop from an \u201carbitrary authority or contest for power.\u201d His evolutionary perspective embraces the metaphor of change as progress. Condensing this, Robert Rowland explains, \u201cThe theories which best meet a discipline\u2019s needs will survive.\u201d The work of Thomas Kuhn, however, amply demonstrates the limits of such an evolutionary perspective of epistemic development. And although Toulmin now would not embrace the container model of knowledge accumulation, the original discussion of fields lacked an emphasis on the dynamics of social struggles for symbolic legitimacy, which may explain the current limitations in understanding how authority is produced and articulated in social space. The shared purposes of social agents also has been offered as a useful descriptor of argument fields Rowland argues a conception of fields based on the shared purpose of the agents operating within the field. Zarefsky summarizes this notion, indicating that \u201ctwo arguers are in the same field if they share a common purpose, and \u2026 the arguments they produce will differ in important ways from arguments which derive from a different purpose.\u201d In short, participants argue over what constitute the \u201cbest way\u201d to engage in activities within the area of inquiry. This conception of fields begins to define a social arena based on an agent\u2019s participation in a struggle over the instrumental means and terminal states of a social field. It should be recognized that participants also share in the struggle for scarce resources-be they economic, cultural, political or symbolic. These agents argue over the legitimate perspective on what should constitute a claim to know, so they share in a struggle for epistemic legitimacy. The resolution of this struggle determines what types of argumentative proof are legitimated in the field. Extending from Toulmin\u2019s work, many scholars recognize that the symbolic negotiation of authority within social fields is ongoing. Such negotiation requires a discursive struggle in which arguments are presented and then accepted or rejected by the community of participants. Charles Kneuper notes that \u201csocial fields are strongly influenced by rhetorical practice in both their continuation and change.\u201d  Furthermore, James Klumpp suggests that \u201cwhen a community encounter an experience there are normally multiple understandings of it. Through communication the community works out its choice of ways to respond (that is, its definition of the situation) and then sanctions \u2026 appropriate action.\u201d Social actors categorize events in order to respond to those events in appropriate ways. This categorization is based, primarily, on the language practices of the social field. For example, welfare policies frame cultural myths of an \u201cunderclass\u201d and may exacerbate the problems of social members of lower economic status. The connotations associated with the term \u201cunderclass,\u201d such as chronic laziness, stigmatize members of the group. The policies that are formulated, therefore, are based on the perceived \u201ccharacter\u201d of the members of the underclass, rather than the larger social, historical, and economic causes of their economic status. The implication is that action is often based on the successful symbolic struggles which categorize events, rather than on \u201cgood reasons.\u201d Since new ideas are filtered through taken-for-granted social assumptions, there is a general conservative social orientation toward argument. This helps explain how argument fields are maintained. Craig Dudezak, while recognizing that struggles take place within disciplines, claims that overall participants \u201cmaintain general disciplinary assumptions.\u201d Wenzel writes that \u201cargument fields exhibit a persistence over time\u201d and for Charles Willard \u201cfields exist \u2026 through the ongoing defining activities\u201d and the \u201crecurring themes in a group\u2019s practices.\u201d  In other words, certain symbolic forms of authority are reproduced and others are limited socially. Certain forms of argumentative support are celebrated and other forms are dismissed based on the social forms of authority previously established by the agents participating in the field. But fields are not always stable. Postmodern scholars remind us that diversity and differences are the norm. Hence, attention must be paid to the diversity of discursive struggles that challenge traditional forms of social authority. Communities of memory, necessary for social negotiation, are partially established through discursive practices. But within the community, conflict is ever-present. So, what is the relationship between the community and the conflict within the field? Furthermore, what are the implications of the struggle? Hanson argues that the forums of field disputes can serve to \u201cexclude\u201d an individual \u201cfrom further discussions.\u201d He is certainly correct; However. It is more than just a forum that excludes individuals and perspectives from participation and consideration in social fields. Despite these contributions, there has been insufficient discussion of the pragmatic struggles in which agents are engaged. The community of argument scholars will be served by a general theory of social fields in order to evaluate particular examples. Over a decade ago, Zarefsky contended that \u201cwe need an account of the growth and demuse of fields against which we can check individual claims.\u201d What the current discussion lacks, specifically, is a consideration of the role that symbolic struggles of categorization of \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d forms of authority plays in the stability and change of a social field\u2019s assumptions, which serve as the basis for the subsequent social structuring of practices. Current field theory fails to account adequately for social power and the conflict over scarce symbolic resources at the base of that social power. The study of such struggle is important because it relates to the stability and legitimacy of the dominant forms of discourse. Subsequently, there has been little attention to the real world implications of marginalizing alternative arguments within fields. For example, Nancy Fraser argues that the conceptual framing of social welfare policies excludes meaningful interpretation of social needs from a feminist perspective. The social forms of authority surrounding the welfare debate are defined by political \u201cprofessionals.\u201d Consequently, the interpretation of a welfare recipient\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d are considered primarily from the dominant political perspective. Excluded from the political debate are alternative voices and arguments. Lack of attention to the symbolic means of exclusion, such as this, is troubling. Rhetorical scholars need a theory which can help explain how and why certain arbitrary expressions are celebrated, while others are excluded altogether due to discursive struggles within dynamic social fields. Furthermore, scholars should be encouraged to explore the symbolic means agents employ to challenge traditionally dominant forms of argumentative authority.

The appeal to the sentimentality, morality, the moral abstraction/distraction of equality\u2014both as a political command and its anthropological requisite\u2014complicate the most obvious consequence of anti-Black racism, namely violence.

But this project supposes an erroneous view of the white racist which occludes the reality of white supremacy and anti-Black racism. As Robert F.

She rewrites history, pens morality, and embodies the post-racial civil rights subject. As such, racism, the milieu of the white racist is not the exposed pathological existence of the white race, but rather valorized in white individuality, the individuality that conceptualizes their racism as a normative aspiration of what the world should look like, and even more damning, an aspiration that can be supported and propagated in the world. The white racist recognizes the deliberateness of the structures, relations, and systems in a white supremacist society and seeks like their colonial foreparents to claim them as their own.

Just as science has been reluctant to recognize the holistic qualities of nature, so we have been slow to appreciate that the power of industrialism and its resultant near-hegemony in the modern world is largely the result of its ability to integrate science, politics, and everyday social life within a structure that appears complete and self-sufficient. This structure cannot be challenged without reference to alternative structures. To celebrate choice and free play without also celebrating the frames of meaning within which they take place is simply to guarantee our assimilation to and absorption within industrialism, and so represents a philosophy of surrender. For example, \u201cfreedom\u201d has little meaning in the absence of a framework of democratic laws which protect the vulnerable against the \u201cfreedom\u201d of the powerful to exploit, intimidate, and mislead. Similarly, my freedom to explore an area of wilderness is negated if energy companies and off-road vehicle clubs also have the freedom to use the area as they see fit. Freedom is all to often interpreted as the absence of structure; and structure gives meaning and implies responsibilities and limitations. One of the most insidious aspects of the colonization of the world is industrialism's silent but lethal elimination of structures that could challenge it. The widespread lack of appreciation within academia of the way in which postmodern approaches involving deconstruction promote this insidious conceptual assimilation to industrialism is an index of the urgent need to develop a psychocultural dimension to our environmental understanding. Finally, we should not ignore the possibility that an emphasis on language serves particular defensive functions for the social scientist. Noam Chomsky has noted that it\u201dit's too hard to deal with real problems,\u201d some academics tend to \u201cgo off on wild goose chases that don't matter . . . [or] get involved in academic cults that are very divorced from any reality  and that provide a defense against dealing with the world as it actually is.\u201d71 An emphasis on language can serve this sort of defensive function; for the study of discourse enables one to stand aside from issues and avoid any commitment to a cause or idea, simply presenting all sides of a debate and pointing out the discursive strategies involved. As the physical world appears to fade into mere discourse, so it comes to seem less real than the language used to describe it; and environmental issues lose the dimensions of urgency and tragedy and become instead the proving grounds for ideas and attitudes. Rather than walking in what Aldo Leopold described as a \u201cworld of wounds,\u201d the discursive theorist can study this world dispassionately, safely insulated from the emotional and ecological havoc that is taking place elsewhere. Like experimentalism, this is a schizoid stance that exemplifies rather than challenges the characteristic social pathology of out time; and it is one that supports Melanie Klein's thesis that the internal object world can serve as a psychotic substitute for an external \u201creal\u201d world that is either absent or unsatisfying.72 Ian Craib's description of social construction as a \u201csocial psychosis\u201d73 therefore seems entirely apt. But what object relations theorists such as Klein fail to point out is the other side of this dialectic: that withdrawing from the external world and substituting an internal world of words or fantasies, because of the actions that follow from this state of affairs, makes the former even less satisfying and more psychologically distant, so contributing to the vicious spiral that severs the \u201chuman from the \u201cnatural\u201d and  abandons nature to industrialism.", ""], "id": "889f1e073286b229124270f5606e498c3f4daa5a399b52e24745f60a6629447a", "highlighted_text": "discursive approaches limits capacity to challenge politics, and everyday social life lack of appreciation within academia promote conceptual assimilation to industrialism it's too hard to deal with real problems, academics \u201cgo off on wild goose chases that don't matter or] get involved in academic cults that are divorced from reality An emphasis on language can serve this function issues lose dimensions of urgency and tragedy the discursive theorist can study this world safely insulated from the emotional havoc that is taking place elsewhere", "highlights": [[2, 40, 68], [2, 75, 96], [2, 396, 430], [2, 1481, 1517], [2, 1585, 1592], [2, 1608, 1618], [2, 1619, 1648], [2, 1924, 1928], [2, 1929, 1965], [2, 1972, 1981], [2, 1990, 2036], [2, 2044, 2087], [2, 2093, 2106], [2, 2111, 2118], [2, 2200, 2238], [2, 2257, 2265], [2, 2617, 2628], [2, 2633, 2666], [2, 2806, 2850], [2, 2868, 2903], [2, 2919, 2955]], "underlines": [[2, 13, 39], [2, 40, 68], [2, 69, 74], [2, 75, 96], [2, 97, 135], [2, 221, 395], [2, 396, 430], [2, 431, 762], [2, 1466, 1480], [2, 1481, 1517], [2, 1518, 1584], [2, 1585, 1592], [2, 1593, 1607], [2, 1608, 1618], [2, 1619, 1648], [2, 1649, 1753], [2, 1891, 1920], [2, 1921, 1924], [2, 1924, 1928], [2, 1929, 1965], [2, 1965, 1971], [2, 1972, 1981], [2, 1982, 1989], [2, 1990, 2036], [2, 2037, 2044], [2, 2044, 2087], [2, 2088, 2092], [2, 2093, 2106], [2, 2107, 2110], [2, 2111, 2118], [2, 2120, 2196], [2, 2200, 2238], [2, 2239, 2256], [2, 2257, 2265], [2, 2265, 2266], [2, 2617, 2628], [2, 2629, 2632], [2, 2633, 2666], [2, 2806, 2850], [2, 2851, 2867], [2, 2868, 2903], [2, 2904, 2918], [2, 2919, 2955], [2, 2955, 2956]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2065-07-01"}, {"tag": "Debate should deal with discussions of real-world oppression, and the aff avoids that", "cite": "Curry 14 Dr. Tommy J. Curry The Cost of a Thing: A Kingian Reformulation of a Living Wage Argument in the 21st Century. 2014", "body": ["Despite the pronouncement of debate as an activity and intellectual exercise pointing to the real world consequences of dialogue, thinking, and (personal) politics when addressing issues of racism, sexism, economic disparity, global conflicts, and death, many of the discussions concerning these ongoing challenges to humanity are fixed to a paradigm which sees the adjudication of material disparities and sociological realities as the conquest of one ideal theory over the other. In \u201cIdeal Theory as Ideology,\u201d Charles Mills outlines the problem contemporary theoretical-performance styles in policy debate and value-weighing in Lincoln-Douglass are confronted with in their attempts to get at the concrete problems in our societies. At the outset, Mills concedes that \u201cideal theory applies to moral theory as a whole (at least to normative ethics as against metaethics); [s]ince ethics deals by definition with normative/prescriptive/evaluative issues, [it is set] against factual/descriptive issues.\u201dAt the most general level, the conceptual chasm between what emerges as actual problems in the world (e.g.: racism, sexism, poverty, disease, etc.) and how we frame such problems theoretically\u2014the assumptions and shared ideologies we depend upon for our problems to be heard and accepted as a worthy \u201cproblem\u201d by an audience\u2014is the most obvious call for an anti-ethical paradigm, since such a paradigm insists on the actual as the basis of what can be considered normatively. Mills, however, describes this chasm as a problem of an ideal-as-descriptive model which argues that for any actual-empirical-observable social phenomenon (P), an ideal of (P) is necessarily a representation of that phenomenon. In the idealization of a social phenomenon (P), one \u201cnecessarily has to abstract away from certain features\u201d of (P) that is observed before abstraction occurs. This gap between what is actual(in the world), and what is represented by theories and politics of debaters proposed in rounds threatens any real discussions about the concrete nature of oppression and the racist economic structures which necessitate tangible policies and reorienting changes in our value orientations. As Mills states: \u201cWhat distinguishes ideal theory is the reliance on idealization to the exclusion, or at least marginalization, of the actual,\u201d so what we are seeking to resolve on the basis of \u201cthought\u201d is in fact incomplete, incorrect, or ultimately irrelevant to the actual problems which our \u201ctheories\u201d seek to address. Our attempts to situate social disparity cannot simply appeal to the ontologization of social phenomenon\u2014meaning we cannot suggest that the various complexities of social problems (which are constantly emerging and undisclosed beyond the effects we observe) are totalizable by any one set of theories within an ideological frame be it our most cherished notions of Afro-pessimism, feminism, Marxism, or the like. At best, theoretical endorsements make us aware of sets of actions to address ever developing problems in our empirical world, but even this awareness does not command us to only do X, but rather do X and the other ideas which compliment the material conditions addressed by the action X. As a whole, debate (policy and LD) neglects the need to do X in order to remedy our cast-away-ness among our ideological tendencies and politics. How then do we pull ourselves from this seeming ir-recoverability of thought in general and in our endorsement of socially actualizable values like that of the living wage? It is my position that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s thinking about the need for a living wage was a unique, and remains an underappreciated, resource in our attempts to impose value reorientation be it through critique or normative gestures) upon the actual world. In other words, King aims to reformulate the values which deny the legitimacy of the living wage, and those values predicated on the flawed views of the worker, Blacks, and the colonized (dignity, justice, fairness, rights, etc.) used to currently justify the living wages in under our contemporary moral parameters.", ""], "id": "d55040eafca0219fbaf0590db34ec6ffbfdd8b70e5afaa9f94e3d4d17f2ab4e5", "highlighted_text": "debate sees the adjudication of material disparities as the conquest of one ideal theory over the other the chasm between actual problems and how we frame such problems This gap threatens any real discussions about the concrete nature of oppression we cannot suggest that various complexities of social problems are totalizable by one set of theories within an ideological frame", "highlights": [[2, 29, 35], [2, 357, 402], [2, 430, 480], [2, 1031, 1034], [2, 1046, 1059], [2, 1076, 1082], [2, 1083, 1091], [2, 1152, 1155], [2, 1156, 1182], [2, 1868, 1876], [2, 1995, 2025], [2, 2026, 2035], [2, 2036, 2051], [2, 2052, 2065], [2, 2626, 2648], [2, 2653, 2692], [2, 2771, 2774], [2, 2775, 2786], [2, 2787, 2789], [2, 2794, 2797], [2, 2798, 2841]], "underlines": [[2, 29, 35], [2, 357, 402], [2, 430, 480], [2, 1031, 1034], [2, 1046, 1059], [2, 1076, 1082], [2, 1083, 1091], [2, 1105, 1151], [2, 1152, 1155], [2, 1156, 1182], [2, 1868, 1876], [2, 1995, 2025], [2, 2026, 2035], [2, 2036, 2051], [2, 2052, 2065], [2, 2626, 2648], [2, 2653, 2692], [2, 2771, 2774], [2, 2775, 2786], [2, 2787, 2789], [2, 2794, 2797], [2, 2798, 2841]], "emphasis": [[2, 2036, 2051], [2, 2794, 2797]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2014-01-01"}, {"tag": "Base", "cite": "Ferguson 11/26 Niall Ferguson is a British historian and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, BostonGlobe, 11-26-2018, [\"Has Trump peaked?\", https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/11/26/has-trump-peaked/O5hgSLNpAOfU2QcY4DVPmJ/story.html] bcr 12-5-2018", "body": ["Thanksgiving is a wonderful festivity. Unlike Christmas, it has somehow eluded commercialization. The formula remains the time-honoured one: Get your family together, eat turkey, count your blessings. Asked on Thursday what he was thankful for, President Trump replied: \u201cFor having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country. . . . This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Now, not everyone thinks this ludicrous. In the most recent Economist/YouGov poll, 40 percent of respondents said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president, of whom 24 percent said they \u201cstrongly approved\u201d of his performance. Among Republican voters in the same poll, 62 percent expressed strong approval. He still has his base. Yet it is impossible not to sense a change in the air. On the day that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate as the newest Supreme Court justice \u2014 a day many Republicans celebrated as a tremendous victory over their Democratic opponents \u2014 I offered the following thought to my wife: \u201cThis is peak Trump.\u201d That was on Oct. 6. Nothing that has happened in the intervening seven weeks has led me to change my mind. Since then, it has been all downhill. First, take another look at the results of the congressional midterm elections. Now that all but a handful of races have been settled, it is clear that this was a serious defeat for the president\u2019s party. In the House of Representatives, the Democrats gained 37 seats, more than enough to give them control for the next two years. The most concerning trends for Republican strategists must be their poor performance with women voters, particularly those with college degrees, and with younger voters. According to exit polls, college-educated women preferred Democratic candidates by a margin of 59 to 39. Clear majorities of voters ages 18 to 29 (67 percent) and 30 to 44 (58 percent) favored the Democrats. Partly because of these demographic differentials, Republican candidates lost in key districts in two of the states that decided the 2016 presidential election in Trump\u2019s favour: Michigan and Pennsylvania. Second, let\u2019s talk about the economy. By most standard measures, it\u2019s in robust health. The International Monetary Fund expects that growth this year will be just under 3 percent, the highest since 2005. The official unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since December 1969, when Richard Nixon was president. (More about him later.) Yet only Republican voters give Trump any credit for the economy\u2019s strength. According to the polls, around 70 percent of Democrats disapprove of his handling of the economy. That helps explain why the economy didn\u2019t help Republican candidates in the midterms. Immediately prior to the vote, pollsters found that health care beat the economy into second place as the most important issue. You may recall the Republicans\u2019 epic failure to reform or repeal Obamacare. Now ask yourself what would happen if the economy took a turn for the worse. For investors in both stocks and bonds, that has already happened. On the day before Thanksgiving, the S&P closed at just under 2,650, 1.3 percent below where it began the year. Bond yields have risen significantly this year, from below 2.5 percent to above 3 percent, inflicting losses on bondholders. It is hard to see where respite could come from. The Federal Reserve seems on course to keep raising interest rates and unwinding the expansion of its balance sheet that occurred in response to the financial crisis. The Republicans gave the economy the fiscal equivalent of a sugar rush with the tax cuts they passed this time last year. The glucose level in the bloodstream is now falling and the full scale of the fiscal irresponsibility is beginning to sink in. Third, President Trump and his inner circle are about to be hit not just by the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, but also by a barrage of attacks from congressional committees soon to be chaired by Democrats. Control of the House gives Trump\u2019s political foes two powerful weapons. First, congressional committees have an arsenal of investigative tools that the majority party can wield. The most important is Congress\u2019s subpoena power to compel the production of documents or the sworn testimony of witnesses in furtherance of a congressional investigation. Second, Congress has the power to make public the results of any investigation. In short, you can expect 2019 to feel a lot like 1973, as every liberal legislator and journalist sets out to reenact Watergate, casting Trump in the role of Nixon. For a time, it seemed to me that Trump might be able to transcend all these threats with foreign policy successes based on his primal, intuitive grasp of the relative weaknesses of America\u2019s foes. I no longer believe he has the discipline or patience necessary to exploit this advantage. Policy on North Korea is a mess: Kim Jong Un now openly flouts the constraints that were supposedly placed on him in Singapore. Policy on Iran is an even bigger mess: The administration\u2019s cack-handed defense of its Saudi ally\u2019s murder of Jamal Khashoggi has been shameful. And policy on China may well become a mess if the president opts for a photo opportunity rather than meaningful concessions on trade when he meets Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. Finally, a caveat. I have called \u201cpeak Trump\u201d before and been wrong. In January 2016, I foolishly predicted that he would flop in the Republican primaries. So I could be wrong again. One of the things that make me thankful to live in America is that this country is so wildly unpredictable.

(That's Veteran's Day). But it turns out America's military has quite a bit to celebrate this year\u2014in large part thanks to President Trump. When Donald Trump first took office, \"Americans really didn't know if this guy was going to get us into a war,\" says Real Clear Politics pollster Sean Trende. \"There was real worry about how risky it was to elect him president.\" Among military hawks, the concern was Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric leading to U.S. withdrawal from the world, with less support for the Defense Department and its mission. Instead, this Memorial Day America's military's budget is bursting at its seams, soldiers' paychecks are getting bigger, its Special Forces are deployed in record numbers, and U.S. troops are on the ground in significant numbers in Afghanistan and Syria. For a foreign policy establishment that once worried Mr. Trump might abandon NATO and pull troops from abroad, this is a major turnaround. When asked to describe the mood at the Pentagon thus far during the Trump presidency, longtime DOD reporter Jamie McIntyre says \"they're keeping their heads down, but they're happy.\" McIntyre, now the author of the Daily on Defense newsletter, says the DoD is \"very happy with the budget President Trump signed -- they feel like that was absolutely vital. And they're also happy with the role he has given [Defense] Secretary Mattis on the world stage.\" That budget deal pumped an additional $165 billion into the Defense Department over the next two years, a \"huge win for defense hawks,\" according to Mackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute. And it seems to signal a solid shift by President Trump into the defense-policy mainstream. Voters who wanted a Trump presidency to usher in a Rand Paul foreign policy are clearly disappointed. Enthusiastic Trump fan Ann Coulter, for example, criticized Trump's decision earlier this year to bomb Syria-- \"a country 7k miles away and of zero strategic interest\"\u2014in response to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. Trump's support for the military makes sense given how they've supported him. Veterans supported Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton 60-34 percent in 2016, and, according to polling, continue to support the president at far higher numbers than the overall electorate. And while polling of active-duty military members is rare, one such poll last October found 44 percent have a favorable view of the president at a time when his overall approval rating was around 38 percent. Interestingly, Trump's approval was highest among the rank-and-file soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines (48 percent), and lowest among officers (30 percent). Still, President Trump has had his share of stumbles on military and veterans, most notably the failed nomination of would-be VA Secretary Dr. Ronny Jackson. And some complain that President Trump has not moved as swiftly on veterans' issues as he promised, even as problems like long wait times remain. And according to McIntyre, the lack of public DoD briefings during the Trump era reflects concerns by the Pentagon brass of being caught up in the president's political slipstream. \"Press briefings with generals used to happen all the time,\" McIntyre said. \"Not anymore. Nobody wants to see their name in the president's Twitter feed at 6 in the morning.\" Overall, however, the president remains relatively popular. His pick of acting VA Secretary Robert Wilkie has been met with approval by the American Legion and AMVETS, and Mr. Trump is about to sign a sweeping new VA reform bill, the MISSION Act, expanding private-sector healthcare access to veterans, a move also backed by veterans groups. Veterans are key part of Trump's base and, like his evangelical and Second-Amendment supporters, Trump treats them with special care. Is it really a coincidence that President Trump has focused on the NFL protests? While kneeling during the national anthem is unpopular among all Americans, veterans are even more offended. At the same time, video of President Trump shaking the hand of every one of this year's 1,042 Naval Academy graduates went viral on the Right. This may be mere symbolism, but symbolism is often simply smart politics. According to a Zogby poll from last year, veterans are part of what he calls the \"hidden Trump vote,\" almost half saying they are reluctant to admit their support for the president. In other words, President Trump's margin among vets may be even higher than it appears.

February 26, 2016. https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/foreign-military-sales-remain-an-important-tool-of-u-s-national-security/", "body": ["As still the world\u2019s sole superpower, the United States possesses an unequaled array of instruments to support its foreign and defense strategies. With so much attention being focused on the conflicts in the Middle East, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and Chinese efforts to assert its hegemony in the Western Pacific, the fact that the United States employs a wide range of non-military, or at least non-kinetic tools in pursuing its national interests is lost. Most recently, for example, the United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade sanctions on North Korea in response to that country\u2019s test of a long-range ballistic missile. One of the most important of these tools is foreign military sales (FMS). The complex role of FMS is reflected, in part, in the fact that the program is run by the Department of State and not the Department of Defense. One reason for this unusual management approach is that the FMS program involves sales by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign governments. As a result, such sales reflect the views of the U.S. government with respect to the recipient country, its relationships with others in the region and the overall approach this country takes to mitigating the threat of regional or global conflict. The FMS program serves many other purposes. The sales of U.S. arms and related items to foreign countries helps reduce the cost of those systems to our own military. FMS sales help to ensure the ability of U.S. allies to defend themselves and support the maintenance of stable regional military balances. Equally important, FMS sales over time establish enduring relationships between foreign governments and their militaries and the U.S. When the U.S. military trains alongside those of allies equipped with the same hardware, it helps to cement the bonds between our countries. Moreover, it improves communications and understanding among these militaries, often helping to inculcate U.S. values related to the use of military force. Foreign militaries dependent on access to U.S. hardware, spare parts, software upgrades and training are more likely to listen to this country when there is a dispute regarding regional politics or defense issues. FMS has been particularly important as an instrument for influencing foreign governments and shaping regional balances of power in the Middle East. Following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the United States completely reequipped the Egyptian military. The Egyptian-Israeli border has been remarkably stable ever since. Sales of military aircraft, missile defense systems and precision munitions to the nations of the Persian Gulf have been instrumental in ensuring a stable balance of forces in that area. Pakistan has been a recipient of U.S. arms. FMS sales have been extremely important to U.S. efforts to ensure Pakistan\u2019s reliability as an ally in the war on terror. Congress has appropriated about $3.6 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Pakistan since 2001. The kind of equipment provided ranges from radios, transport aircraft and unmanned systems to F-16 fighters. Recently, the State Department approved the sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan. Pakistan intends to use these aircraft in its fight against domestic terrorists. The U.S. and other regional allies have found the F-16 to be an effective platform for conducting precision strikes against terrorist targets. In addition, India is pursuing a major Air Force modernization program. The sale of F-16s to Pakistan would help to maintain the balance of power in the subcontinent. Unfortunately, Senator Rand Paul has filed a Joint Resolution of Disapproval for this sale, something that hasn\u2019t happened since the 1980s. The effort to block this sale is a mistake. It will serve only to weaken the relationship between our two countries even as the fight against the Taliban continues and intensifies in Afghanistan. In addition, it leaves the way open for Pakistan to acquire aircraft from other suppliers, such as China or Russia. The only practical effect that disapproval of this sale will have is to weaken Washington\u2019s hand at a time when it needs all the policy instruments it can muster.

Concerns that Moscow and Beijing are actively trying to reshape the balance of power are not new and have been a focus of the new U.S. national security and defense strategies. But while top military officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about Russian and Chinese activities in other parts of the world, from Europe to Asia to Africa, there is a sense that not enough attention has been paid to what both countries have been able to do in South and Central America. \"We can't just pay attention to what they're doing in Europe or in the South China Sea,\" warned Admiral Kurt Tidd, the commander of U.S. Southern Command. \"Right here, far closer to home, there is competition going on,\" Tidd told reporters Thursday in Washington. \"It's competition for influence and the single-most important thing we can do is compete ourselves.\" Russia, in particular, has been increasingly aggressive in re-establishing a military presence, sending ships to the region to make port calls while also boosting its intelligence-gathering platforms and operations, according to officials. Defense ties Moscow has also worked to repair or cement defense ties with former allies in the region, selling them advanced weaponry like military jets and air defense systems. \"The country that has benefited most from Russian military sales has been Venezuela, a significant number of high-tech systems that clearly are not warranted from the security threats in the area,\" Tidd said. U.S. Southern Command points to Nicaragua as another beneficiary of the Russian military push, saying the country recently took delivery of refurbished tanks. Other countries looking to modernize or upgrade their military capabilities are also being targeted, often being lured with lower prices. In January, during a visit by Argentinian President Mauricio Macri to Moscow, the counties signed a memorandum of understanding to boost uranium production in Argentina, and Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to sell Macri rocket engines. Russia has also been exploring deals with Brazil, which bought Russian-made MANPADS [man-portable air defense systems] last year and has expressed interest in Russia's Pantsir surface-to-air missile system. Yet U.S. officials also accuse Russia of using information campaigns to gain an advantage, in one case scuttling a possible sale of U.S. armored vehicles to Peru. \"Some, I think, very unhelpful propaganda came out of Russia talking about undercutting and underselling the ability of the [U.S.-made] Stryker to do its job,\" Tidd said. \"And then they roll in with some refurbished BTR's [armored personnel carriers] at a cut-rate price.\" But some analysts think the concern may be overstated. \"Two, three years ago you saw that sort of propaganda,\" Stratfor Latin America Analyst Paulo Gregoire told VOA. \"You do not see that sort of propaganda lately.\" Lack money for military A big reason, Gregoire said, is that countries across Latin America do not have the money to spend on military hardware like they did even a few years ago. That is not to say that Russia does not have other advantages. \"Governments in Latin America like to deal with other governments directly and get things done government-to-government,\" Gregoire said, something they can do more easily with Russia and China. \"With the U.S., you talk to the government but actually have to talk to [defense] companies,\" he said, adding there are persistent concerns that any arms deal could be blocked by the U.S. Congress. China's inroads in South and Central America, while equally worrisome to U.S. officials, have focused less on military sales and more on economic development. One country of particular concern is Panama. China is already the world's second-largest user of the Panama Canal, according to Panamanian officials, and the two countries are set to begin a new round of trade negotiations next month. While U.S. military officials are not yet worried Beijing's efforts will have any immediate impact on the ability of the U.S. to move military vessels and materiel through the region, they are wary given China's ability to move quickly from economic ventures to military ones. \"I'm thinking of Djibouti,\" U.S. Southern Command's Tidd told reporters Thursday, referencing China's first foreign military base in Africa. \"How quickly they've ramped that up and established a fairly major presence.\"", ""], "id": "644712e7cfce8e54cc77d8fa0a418a4d2ccde36d39820c3bfc5fcb0d6674a723", "highlighted_text": "Russia and China are making steady progress in reshaping the current international order trying to reshape the balance of power not enough attention has been paid to what both do in South and Central America.

If they were to accomplish their aims of establishing hegemony in their desired spheres of influence, the world would return to the condition it was in at the end of the 19th century, with competing great powers clashing over inevitably intersecting and overlapping spheres of interest. These were the unsettled, disordered conditions that produced the fertile ground for the two destructive world wars of the first half of the 20th century. The collapse of the British-dominated world order on the oceans, the disruption of the uneasy balance of power on the European continent due to the rise of a powerful unified Germany, combined with the rise of Japanese power in East Asia all contributed to a highly competitive international environment in which dissatisfied great powers took the opportunity to pursue their ambitions in the absence of any power or group of powers to unite in checking them. The result was an unprecedented global calamity. It has been the great accomplishment of the U.S.-led world order in the 70 years since the end of the Second World War that this kind of competition has been held in check and great power conflicts have been avoided. The role of the United States, however, has been critical. Until recently, the dissatisfied great and medium-size powers have faced considerable and indeed almost insuperable obstacles to achieving their objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the order itself and of its principal promoter and defender. The American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as \u201csituations of strength\u201d in their regions that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously and in most respects to defer serious efforts to disrupt the international system. The system has served as a check on their ambitions in both positive and negative ways. They have been participants in and for the most part beneficiaries of the open international economic system the United States created and helped sustain and, so long as that system was functioning, have had more to gain by playing in it than by challenging and overturning it. The same cannot be said of the political and strategic aspects of the order, both of which have worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy of democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of Soviet communism have posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions, including especially the geographical advance close to their borders, as an existential threat\u2014and with reason. The continual threat to the basis of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported order has made them hostile both to the order and to the United States. However, it has also been a source of weakness and vulnerability. Chinese rulers in particular have had to worry about what an unsuccessful confrontation with the United States might do to their sources of legitimacy at home. And although Vladimir Putin has to some extent used a calculated foreign adventurism to maintain his hold on domestic power, he has taken a more cautious approach when met with determined U.S. and European opposition, as in the case of Ukraine, and pushed forward, as in Syria, only when invited to do so by U.S. and Western passivity. Autocratic rulers in a liberal democratic world have had to be careful. The greatest check on Chinese and Russian ambitions, however, has come from the combined military power of the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia. China, although increasingly powerful itself, has had to contemplate facing the combined military strength of the world\u2019s superpower and some very formidable regional powers linked by alliance or common strategic interest, including Japan, India, and South Korea, as well as smaller but still potent nations like Vietnam and Australia. Russia has had to face the United States and its NATO allies. When united, these military powers present a daunting challenge to a revisionist power that can call on no allies of its own for assistance. Even were the Chinese to score an early victory in a conflict, they would have to contend over time with the combined industrial productive capacities of some of the world\u2019s richest and most technologically advanced nations. A weaker Russia would face an even greater challenge. Faced with these obstacles, the two great powers, as well as the lesser dissatisfied powers, have had to hope for or if possible engineer a weakening of the U.S.-supported world order from within. This could come about either by separating the United States from its allies, raising doubts about the U.S. commitment to defend its allies militarily in the event of a conflict, or by various means wooing American allies out from within the liberal world order\u2019s strategic structure. For most of the past decade, the reaction of American allies to greater aggressiveness on the part of China and Russia in their respective regions, and to Iran in the Middle East, has been to seek more reassurance from the United States. Russian actions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria; Chinese actions in the East and South China seas; Iranian actions in Syria, Iraq, and along the littoral of the Persian Gulf\u2014all have led to calls by American allies and partners for a greater commitment. In this respect, the system has worked as it was supposed to.

The democratic waves that ebbed and flowed between the 19th and 20th centuries appear to be receding once more. The signs of pushback against liberal values and democratic institutions are not just visible in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, but also in the strongholds of Western Europe and North America. After triumphantly declaring the \"end of history\" in 1989, scholars like Francis Fukuyama now fear that the world is moving from a \"democratic recession\" toward a \"democratic depression.\" With illiberalism on the rise, there are fears that this could be the year the global liberal order dies. The order consists of a dense network of international agreements, trade arrangements and military alliances. Drawing on enlightenment era values of liberty and reason, it was constructed by U.S. President Roosevelt and the Western allies in 1945. Its express purpose was to prevent the recurrence of war and the economic nationalism that inspired conflict to begin with. While the order has come under criticism in the past, it has never experienced anything quite like the assault of the present. At the centre of the global liberal order are a clutch of organizations designed to defend democratic governance, open economies and common security. Among them are the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (all founded in 1945), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that later became the World Trade Organization (in 1995), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in 1949) and others. Taken together, their express goal is to generate positive sum, or win-win, solutions. While critics routinely grumbled about their legitimacy, effectiveness and overstretch, on balance, they have helped preserve stability, extend democracy and expand economic opportunity. While the global liberal democratic order is most certainly down, it is far from out. According to the Polity Project which tracks trends in autocracy and democracy, democratic governance is still spreading. In 1989, at the time of Mr. Fukuyama's pronouncement, there were 52 democracies. By 2009, at the start of the Obama administration, the number had risen to 87. Today there are at least 103, accounting for over 60 per cent of the world's population. Even China and Russia are less repressive to their own populations than in the past. It is true that some democracies in parts of Western and Eastern Europe have experienced set-backs and a spike in reactionary nationalism, but these are nevertheless remarkable achievements. So what explains the fears of a democratic deficit and the decline of the global liberal order? According to columnist Edward Luce, a big part of the story has to do with the spectacular rise of China. The country's economic growth is nothing short of breathtaking: Its GDP grew from $950-billion (U.S.) in 2000 to $22-trillion in 2016. What's more, China benefited from three geopolitical windfalls over this period \u2013 the Iraq War in 2003, the 2008 global financial meltdown and the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Each of these developments bolstered the appeal of China's alternative, and authoritarian, pathway to development, emboldening autocrats who may have previously been swayed by the political and economic dividends of liberalism.", ""], "id": "4af930fe69158530fc056b3aca77074e660e2f6e83b8b4ca4e2f6190cfb0a6d8", "highlighted_text": "For the first time in over half a century democracy is in retreat signs of pushback against democratic institutions are visible in strongholds of Western Europe and North America this could be the year the global liberal order dies the rise of China and the election of Trump. these bolstered the appeal of authoritarian autocrats", "highlights": [[2, 0, 41], [2, 50, 73], [2, 191, 216], [2, 236, 259], [2, 260, 263], [2, 273, 283], [2, 341, 388], [2, 630, 682], [2, 2782, 2785], [2, 2798, 2811], [2, 3087, 3094], [2, 3100, 3111], [2, 3119, 3125], [2, 3134, 3139], [2, 3153, 3176], [2, 3202, 3215], [2, 3253, 3262]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 41], [2, 50, 73], [2, 191, 216], [2, 236, 259], [2, 260, 263], [2, 273, 283], [2, 341, 388], [2, 630, 682], [2, 2782, 2785], [2, 2798, 2811], [2, 3087, 3094], [2, 3100, 3111], [2, 3119, 3125], [2, 3134, 3139], [2, 3153, 3176], [2, 3202, 3215], [2, 3253, 3262]], "emphasis": [[2, 0, 41], [2, 50, 73], [2, 191, 216], [2, 236, 259], [2, 260, 263], [2, 273, 283], [2, 341, 388], [2, 630, 682], [2, 2782, 2785], [2, 2798, 2811], [2, 3087, 3094], [2, 3100, 3111], [2, 3119, 3125], [2, 3134, 3139], [2, 3153, 3176], [2, 3202, 3215], [2, 3253, 3262]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [7, 11]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-01-12"}, {"tag": "Aid provides an incentive to democratize which is a stronger internal link to the aff \u2013 empirics go neg.", "cite": "Schenoni and Mainwaring 18 [Luis, University of Notre Dame, Scott, Harvard University, \u201cUS Hegemony and regime change in Latin America, published 2018, accessible online at ] / MM", "body": ["This section aims to show that US foreign policy on the ground as proxied by foreign aid had a significant impact in the probability of a democratic transition, controlling for other relevant variables. We use survival analysis to test for the impact of US foreign aid policy in the average Latin American country. We replicate the main models in Mainwaring and P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n,57 replacing their measure of US support for democracy (Figure 1) with a country specific measure of US foreign economic and military aid. Two observations are pertinent regarding the way in which Mainwaring and P\u00e9rezLi\u00f1\u00e1n coded US support for democracy in Latin America. First, their variable provides one value per year for the whole region. It therefore fails to reflect the US stance vis-\u00e0-vis specific Latin American countries, which probably biases the regression results in a conservative way by overlooking country-to-country variation. Second, measuring public statements may raise validity issues because actual policies, which are the result of complex political and bureaucratic processes, can be at odds with the statements of individual officials. Country-specific statements could be used to proxy signals, but not agency on the ground.58 We look at foreign aid instead. Almost all cases of effective US pressure on behalf of democracy involved the use of foreign aid, so it should provide a good proxy for US support for regime change. We look at both economic and military aid channelled by any US government agency, department, and office (US Overseas Loans and Grants Greenbook) as a per capita measure. We consider broader trends in aid to capture a larger set of uses. For instance, US support for authoritarian coups was often channelled through military assistance, and USAID was only one among many agencies and organizations through which pro-democratic funding was channelled.59 This variable ranges from zero to 210 US dollars per capita, with over 95% of the observations concentrating below the 100 US dollars per capita threshold. In Tables 1 and 2, we analyse the correlation of US foreign assistance with the probability of a democratic transition among authoritarian regimes (Table 1) and of a democratic breakdown among democracies (Table 2) for the 1945\u20132005 period. We replicate the main survival models in Mainwaring and P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n, using their models 4.4.5 and 4.2.5 as a baseline (first column) that we then modify by introducing the variable for US aid.60 The positive coefficients for US foreign assistance are consistent with the case studies. The US offered aid to authoritarian governments on the condition that they were making progress toward democratization. The US cut aid to authoritarian regimes that were not moving toward democracy. Thus, greater US aid is associated with a greater probability of a transition to democracy. The second column in Table 1 shows that when US foreign assistance proxies for US pro-democracy policies, the association between regional diffusion and US policy preferences, on the one hand, and democratic transitions, on the other, disappears. As measured by the p-value, US policy as proxied by foreign aid has a stronger association with democratic transitions than the regional diffusion variable. In column 3, we take out the variables for regional diffusion and US policy preferences and retain US foreign assistance. Compared to the original model (column 1), the model in column 3 slightly increases explanatory power despite being a bit more parsimonious. Finally, column 4 shows that, as measured by the p-value, the US aid variable was statistically more significant than domestic actors\u2019 preferences in the 1977\u20132005 period. Table 2 applies the same procedure to the survival of democracy. In line with the qualitative findings in the last section, the association of US policy with democratic breakdowns is less impressive. The second column shows that the predictive power of regional diffusion per se is not overcome by adding the variable for US aid. Column 3 shows that overall (1945\u20132005) greater US foreign assistance is associated with a reduced probability of a democratic breakdown. The US did not consistently support democracy in the 1948\u201376 period, so in Column 4 there is more variance in the association of foreign aid with democratic breakdown, resulting in much larger standard errors. The conclusion from these tables is that US foreign assistance is strongly associated with the third wave of democratization in Latin America. US aid or its lack thereof did not cause regime change by itself, but it served as a proxy for US support for democracy and opposition to authoritarianism. Using this proxy, from 1977 to 2005 hegemonic effects were significantly associated with authoritarian breakdown and democratic stability in Latin America. Conversely, results for 1948\u20131976 do not support the idea that the US systematically bolstered authoritarian regimes. Although it goes beyond the goals of this article to explain the waves of authoritarianism from 1948 to 1954 and 1964 to 1977, the polarizing effects of the Cold War, especially after the Cuban revolution, loom large in any understanding of these regional trends. The US was the main actor in the Guatemalan coup of 1954 and it strongly influenced other outcomes, but the evidence suggests that it did not unleash the waves of authoritarianism that began in 1948 and 1964.", ""], "id": "61acff782f5a2bc467352a6f51b546dcffee35151ad12c118a6d3847af524576", "highlighted_text": "US aid had a significant impact Almost all cases of effective US pressure on behalf of democracy involved the use of foreign aid, The US offered aid to authoritarian governments on the condition that they were making progress toward democratization. greater US aid is associated with a greater probability of a transition US foreign assistance is associated with a reduced probability of a democratic breakdown US aid served as a proxy", "highlights": [[2, 31, 33], [2, 85, 113], [2, 1260, 1357], [2, 2561, 2635], [2, 2636, 2680], [2, 2766, 2837], [2, 4069, 4157], [2, 4512, 4518], [2, 4585, 4602]], "underlines": [[2, 31, 33], [2, 34, 84], [2, 85, 113], [2, 114, 159], [2, 1260, 1357], [2, 1597, 1662], [2, 2471, 2474], [2, 2475, 2496], [2, 2497, 2559], [2, 2561, 2635], [2, 2636, 2680], [2, 2766, 2837], [2, 2838, 2850], [2, 2892, 3026], [2, 3045, 3071], [2, 3581, 3587], [2, 3597, 3665], [2, 3920, 4019], [2, 4061, 4068], [2, 4069, 4157], [2, 4410, 4459], [2, 4478, 4493], [2, 4512, 4518], [2, 4585, 4602], [2, 4603, 4666]], "emphasis": [[2, 31, 33], [2, 85, 113], [2, 1260, 1357], [2, 2561, 2635], [2, 2636, 2680], [2, 2766, 2837], [2, 4069, 4157], [2, 4512, 4518], [2, 4585, 4602]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 26]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-01-01"}, {"tag": "Democracy solves a laundry list of impacts \u2013 independently an alt cause to the aff.", "cite": "Kasparov 17 [Garry Kasparov, Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, former World Chess Champion, \u201cDemocracy and Human Rights: The Case for U.S. Leadership,\u201d Testimony Before The Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, February 16th, https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/021617_Kasparov_%20Testimony.pdf]", "body": ["As one of the countless millions of people who were freed or protected from totalitarianism by the United States of America, it is easy for me to talk about the past.

American skepticism about America\u2019s role in the world deepened in the long, painful wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and their aftermaths. Instead of applying the lessons learned about how to do better, lessons about faulty intelligence and working with native populations, the main outcome was to stop trying. This result has been a tragedy for the billions of people still living under authoritarian regimes around the world, and it is based on faulty analysis. You can never guarantee a positive outcome\u2014 not in chess, not in war, and certainly not in politics. The best you can do is to do what you know is right and to try your best. I speak from experience when I say that the citizens of unfree states do not expect guarantees. They want a reason to hope and a fighting chance. People living under dictatorships want the opportunity for freedom, the opportunity to live in peace and to follow their dreams. From the Iraq War to the Arab Spring to the current battles for liberty from Venezuela to Eastern Ukraine, people are fighting for that opportunity, giving up their lives for freedom. The United States must not abandon them. The United States and the rest of the free world has an unprecedented advantage in economic and military strength today. What is lacking is the will. The will to make the case to the American people, the will to take risks and invest in the long-term security of the country, and the world. This will require investments in aid, in education, in security that allow countries to attain the stability their people so badly need. Such investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the cycle of terror, war, refugees, and military intervention that results when America leaves a vacuum of power. The best way to help refugees is to prevent them from becoming refugees in the first place. The Soviet Union was an existential threat, and this focused the attention of the world, and the American people. There existential threat today is not found on a map, but it is very real. The forces of the past are making steady progress against the modern world order. Terrorist movements in the Middle East, extremist parties across Europe, a paranoid tyrant in North Korea threatening nuclear blackmail, and, at the center of the web, an aggressive KGB dictator in Russia. They all want to turn the world back to a dark past because their survival is threatened by the values of the free world, epitomized by the United States. And they are thriving as the U.S. has retreated. The global freedom index has declined for ten consecutive years. No one like to talk about the United States as a global policeman, but this is what happens when there is no cop on the beat. American leadership begins at home, right here. America cannot lead the world on democracy and human rights if there is no unity on the meaning and importance of these things. Leadership is required to make that case clearly and powerfully. Right now, Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades. It is an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America great begins with believing America can be great. The Cold War was won on American values that were shared by both parties and nearly every American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat, Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a Republican, Reagan. This bipartisan consistency created the decades of strategic stability that is the great strength of democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for long-range planning. In contrast, dictators can operate only tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by the balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival. This is why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability to move quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable news. The fear of making things worse has paralyzed the United States from trying to make things better. There will always be setbacks, but the United States cannot quit. The spread of democracy is the only proven remedy for nearly every crisis that plagues the world today. War, famine, poverty, terrorism\u2013all are generated and exacerbated by authoritarian regimes. A policy of America First inevitably puts American security last. American leadership is required because there is no one else, and because it is good for America. There is no weapon or wall that is more powerful for security than America being envied, imitated, and admired around the world. Admired not for being perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try to be better.

It certainly resonates with the view that many vulnerabilities still exist \u2013 the good times have not been used as productively as they might to address these issues, leaving the global economy exposed to the next cyclical downturn. Regional challenges vary, but most intriguing is that unemployment was identified in the report as the single biggest risk on a global basis. At first glance this seems somewhat counterintuitive. Unemployment has, after all, been falling in most regions, with the US now at a 49-year low, UK at a 43-year low, Japan a 25-year low and even the euro zone now at a cycle low. What this means, however, is that it is increasingly difficult to find qualified recruits. And while companies may see low unemployment as a risk to their hiring plans, low unemployment also masks the fear and discontentment that pervades the workforce in most regions. Clearly the combination of glacial wage growth, automation and outsourcing have eroded worker morale and helped fuel populism. Though Amazon has hit the headlines by boosting their minimum wage to $15 an hour, income inequality remains a key concern in most regions and needs to be addressed more comprehensively to help bolster economic and social resilience.

Policy concessions can be considered in areas ranging from security and politics to diplomacy and the economy. In this study, we focus on economic policy concessions. We argue that the United States provides most of its aid to recipient countries willing to accept policy concessions that increase business and economic freedom. In other words, recipient countries must be willing to open up their economy, maintain sound budget spending, and create an environment that is business friendly for international investors. This set of policies is often called the Washington Consensus, which is consistent with policy prescriptions that primary aid donor institutions, such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund, recommend for recipient countries; the promotion of economic and business freedom by the United States is in line with the Washington Consensus. These policies are sometimes designed as an official condition for aid and are believed to be the foundation in creating a \u201cfirst-stage policy reform\u201d and enhancing both stability and integration in the world economy (Williamson 1990). The United States continues to emphasize business and economic freedom through the Washington Consensus by encouraging policies such as liberalization in finance and trade. It is believed that these neoliberal reforms can enhance the interests of the United States as a whole, especially during the last several decades.2 For potential recipient countries, whose policy concessions American firms or certain interest groups consider lucrative, foreign aid is disbursed as side payments. Although the amount of aid is typically small, it is generally sufficient for the recipient countries to adopt the first-stage policy reform (Tarnoff and Lawson 2011). It remains debatable whether economic growth is realized as a result of such policy concessions as proponents of Washington Consensus would anticipate. However, it is clear that aid programmes that are tied to economic policy concessions can produce economic and political winners in the United States. Such policy reforms may directly lead to an increase in American exports or indirectly improve the trade and investment environment for the United States. Unless the aid amount is small and there are other ways to domestically use aid money \u2013 public goods to voters or private or club goods to interest groups \u2013 helping poor countries can work as a \u201cbang-for-the-buck\u201d policy. This way, foreign aid can serve as a useful instrument for domestic political support.3 Furthermore, evidence shows that the United States promotes economic freedom through foreign aid, for example, in the guidelines of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC): \u201cMCC evaluates performance in three areas \u2013 Ruling Justly, Investing in People, and Encouraging Economic Freedom\u201d (MCC 2013). While MCC is a specific form of US foreign aid, it reflects whether recipient countries accept specific economic policies that the United States has attempted to expand on the pretext of economic freedom. In sum, we argue that economic policy concessions desired by a donor country influences which country receives aid and how much. This implies that foreign aid allows donor countries to maximize their interests and extract valuable policy concessions from recipient countries, although whether recipient countries effectively use aid for their development remains a different question to ask. The amount of foreign aid primarily depends on the recipients\u2019 policy salience and the actual need for foreign aid might be secondary. Finally, our theory leads us to construct the following hypothesis.4 Donor hypothesis: The United States is likely to increase the amount of foreign aid if the recipient country makes policy concessions that increase economic and business freedom.", ""], "id": "df0ee7ad873a505b44178272daf5abb5df8668297c31e5624a5dc825dfb13826", "highlighted_text": "the U S provides most of its aid to countries willing to accept policy concessions that increase business and economic freedom to open up their economy policies are designed as an official condition for aid enhancing stability and integration economic and political winners directly lead to an increase in exports or indirectly improve trade and investment aid allows donor countries to maximize their interests and extract valuable policy concessions", "highlights": [[2, 254, 259], [2, 265, 266], [2, 272, 299], [2, 310, 400], [2, 454, 478], [2, 945, 957], [2, 968, 1009], [2, 1094, 1103], [2, 1109, 1134], [2, 2080, 2110], [2, 2157, 2188], [2, 2198, 2219], [2, 2220, 2227], [2, 2232, 2252], [2, 3256, 3350]], "underlines": [[2, 73, 182], [2, 199, 210], [2, 211, 238], [2, 254, 259], [2, 259, 264], [2, 265, 266], [2, 266, 271], [2, 272, 299], [2, 300, 309], [2, 310, 400], [2, 418, 453], [2, 454, 478], [2, 829, 937], [2, 939, 944], [2, 945, 957], [2, 958, 967], [2, 968, 1009], [2, 1010, 1061], [2, 1063, 1088], [2, 1090, 1093], [2, 1094, 1103], [2, 1104, 1108], [2, 1109, 1134], [2, 1135, 1155], [2, 1671, 1688], [2, 1712, 1714], [2, 1715, 1735], [2, 1736, 1766], [2, 1767, 1802], [2, 2008, 2011], [2, 2012, 2022], [2, 2023, 2079], [2, 2080, 2110], [2, 2111, 2131], [2, 2133, 2156], [2, 2157, 2188], [2, 2189, 2197], [2, 2198, 2219], [2, 2220, 2227], [2, 2228, 2231], [2, 2232, 2252], [2, 2253, 2286], [2, 2631, 2657], [2, 2658, 2674], [2, 2675, 2682], [2, 2683, 2694], [2, 3248, 3255], [2, 3256, 3350], [2, 3351, 3375]], "emphasis": [[2, 254, 259], [2, 265, 266], [2, 272, 299], [2, 310, 400], [2, 454, 478], [2, 945, 957], [2, 968, 1009], [2, 1094, 1103], [2, 1109, 1134], [2, 2080, 2110], [2, 2157, 2188], [2, 2198, 2219], [2, 2220, 2227], [2, 2232, 2252], [2, 3256, 3350]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 15]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-06-01"}, {"tag": "Economic growth key to check every world crisis", "cite": "Ferrara 14 [Peter, Director of Entitlement for the Heartland Institute, \u201cWhy economic growth is exponentially more important than income inequality\u201d, published 2014, accessible online at ] // BBM", "body": ["Such economic growth has produced dramatic improvements in personal health as well. Throughout most of human history, a typical lifespan was 25 to 30 years, as Moore and Simon report. But \u201cfrom the mid-18th century to today, life spans in the advanced countries jumped from less than 30 years to about 75 years.\u201d Average life expectancy in the U.S. has grown by more than 50% since 1900. Infant mortality declined from 1 in 10 back then to 1 in 150 today. Children under 15 are at least 10 times less likely to die, as one in four did during the 19th century, with their death rate reduced by 95%. The maternal death rate from pregnancy and childbirth was also 100 times greater back then than today. Moore and Simon further recount, \u201cJust three infectious diseases \u2013 tuberculosis, pneumonia, and diarrhea \u2013 accounted for almost half of all deaths in 1900.\u201d Today, we have virtually eliminated or drastically reduced these and other scourges of infectious disease that have killed or crippled billions throughout human history, such as typhoid fever, cholera, typhus, plague, smallpox, diphtheria, polio, influenza, bronchitis, whooping cough, malaria, and others. Besides the advances in the development and application of modern health sciences, this has resulted from the drastic reduction in filthy and unsanitary living conditions that economic growth has made possible as well. More recently, great progress is being made against heart disease and cancer. Also greatly contributing to the well-being of working people, the middle class, and the poor in America has been the dramatically declining cost of food resulting from economic growth and soaring productivity in agriculture. As Moore and Simon report, \u201cAmericans devoted almost 50 percent of their incomes to putting food on the table in the early 1900s compared with 10 percent in the late 1900s.\u201d While most of human history has involved a struggle against starvation, today in America the battle is against obesity, even more so among the poor. Moore and Simon quote Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, \u201cThe average consumption of protein, minerals, and vitamins is virtually the same for poor and middle income children, and in most cases is well above recommended norms for all children. Most poor children today are in fact overnourished.\u201d That cited data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. As a result, poor children in America today \u201cgrow up to be about 1 inch taller and 10 pounds heavier than the GIs who stormed the beaches of Normandy in World War II.\u201d That has resulted from a U.S. agricultural sector that required 75% of all American workers in 1800, 40% in 1900, and just 2.5% today, to \u201cgrow more than enough food for the entire nation and then enough to make the United States the world\u2019s breadbasket.\u201d Indeed, today, \u201cThe United States feeds three times as many people with one-third as many total farmers on one-third less farmland than in 1900,\u201d in the process producing \u201calmost 25 percent of the world\u2019s food.\u201d Moreover, it is economic growth that has provided the resources enabling us to dramatically reduce pollution and improve the environment, without trashing our standard of living. Moore and Simon write that at the beginning of the last century, \u201cIndustrial cities typically were enveloped in clouds of black soot and smoke. At this stage of the industrial revolution, factories belched poisons into the air\u2014and this was proudly regarded as a sign of prosperity and progress. Streets were smelly and garbage-filled before the era of modern sewage systems and plumbing.\u201d Not any of these truly dramatic advances for the poor, working people and the middle class could have been achieved by redistribution from \u201cthe rich.\u201d Only economic growth could achieve these results. Nor would it have been worth sacrificing any of these world shattering gains for greater economic \u201cequality.\u201d And Barack Obama\u2019s leftist protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, economists have long recognized the conflict between economic equality and maximizing economic growth. Put most simply, penalizing investors, successful entrepreneurs, and job creators with higher taxes, to reward the less productive with government handouts, to make everyone more equal, is a sure fire way to get less productivity, fewer jobs, lower wages, and reduced economic growth. The above history, and the future prospects below, are why to most benefit the poor, working people, and the middle class, our nation\u2019s overriding goal must be to maximize economic growth. Consider, if total real compensation, wages and benefits, grow at just 1% a year, after 20 years the real incomes of working people would be only 22% greater. After 40 years, a generation, real incomes would be 50% more. But with sustained real compensation growth of 2%, after just 20 years the real incomes and living standards of working people would be nearly 50% greater, and after 40 years they would be 120% greater, more than doubled. At sustained 3% growth in wages and benefits, after 20 years the living standards of working people will have almost doubled, and after 40 years they will have more than tripled. The U.S. economy sustained a real rate of economic growth of 3.3% from 1945 to 1973, and achieved the same 3.3% sustained real growth from 1982 to 2007. (Note that this 3.3% growth rate for the entire economy includes population growth. Real wages and benefits discussed above is a per worker concept). It was only during the stagflation decade of 1973 to 1982, reflecting the same Keynesian economics that President Obama is pursuing today, that real growth fell to only half long term trends. If we could revive and sustain that same 3.3% real growth for 20 years, our total economic production (GDP) would double in that time. After 30 years, our economic output would grow by 2 and two-thirds. After 40 years, our prosperity bounty would grow by 3 and two-thirds. If we are truly following growth maximizing policies, we could conceivably do even better than we have in the past. At sustained real growth of 4% per year, our economic production would more than double after 20 years. After 30 years, GDP would more than triple. After 40 years, a generation, total U.S. economic output would nearly quadruple. America would by then have leapfrogged another generation ahead of the rest of the world. Achieving and sustaining such economic growth should be the central focus of national economic policy, for it would solve every problem that plagues and threatens us today. Such booming economic growth would produce surging revenues that would make balancing the budget so much more feasible. Surging GDP would reduce the national debt as a percent of GDP relatively quickly, particularly with balanced budgets not adding any further to the debt. Sustained, rapid economic growth is also the ultimate solution to poverty, as after a couple of decades or so of such growth, the poor would climb to the same living standards as the middle class of today. With sustained, robust, economic growth, maintaining the most powerful military in the world, and thereby ensuring our nation\u2019s security and national defense, will require a smaller and smaller percentage of GDP over time.

And he has cast doubt on existing US security guarantees by suggesting that he will force America\u2019s allies to pay for more of their own defense. If Trump is serious about putting \u201cAmerica first,\u201d his administration will shift US geopolitical strategy toward isolationism and unilateralism, pursuing only the national interests of the homeland. When the US pursued similar policies in the 1920s and 1930s, it helped sow the seeds of World War II. Protectionism \u2013 starting with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which affected thousands of imported goods \u2013 triggered retaliatory trade and currency wars that worsened the Great Depression. More important, American isolationism \u2013 based on a false belief that the US was safely protected by two oceans \u2013 allowed Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world. With the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US was finally forced to take its head out of the sand. Today, too, a US turn to isolationism and the pursuit of strictly US national interests may eventually lead to a global conflict. Even without the prospect of American disengagement from Europe, the European Union and the eurozone already appear to be disintegrating, particularly in the wake of the United Kingdom\u2019s June Brexit vote and Italy\u2019s failed referendum on constitutional reforms in December. Moreover, in 2017, extreme anti-Europe left- or right-wing populist parties could come to power in France and Italy, and possibly in other parts of Europe. Without active US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in. Russia is already challenging the US and the EU in Ukraine, Syria, the Baltics, and the Balkans, and it may capitalize on the EU\u2019s looming collapse by reasserting its influence in the former Soviet bloc countries, and supporting pro-Russia movements within Europe. If Europe gradually loses its US security umbrella, no one stands to benefit more than Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s proposals also threaten to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. He has said that he will make America energy independent, which entails abandoning US interests in the region and becoming more reliant on domestically produced greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels. And he has maintained his position that Islam itself, rather than just radical militant Islam, is dangerous. This view, shared by Trump\u2019s incoming National Security Adviser, General Michael Flynn, plays directly into Islamist militants\u2019 own narrative of a clash of civilizations. Meanwhile, an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach under Trump will likely worsen the longstanding Sunni-Shia proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran. And if the US no longer guarantees its Sunni allies\u2019 security, all regional powers \u2013 including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt \u2013 might decide that they can defend themselves only by acquiring nuclear weapons, and even more deadly conflict will ensue. In Asia, US economic and military primacy has provided decades of stability; but a rising China is now challenging the status quo. US President Barack Obama\u2019s strategic \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia depended primarily on enacting the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump has promised to scrap on his first day in office. Meanwhile, China is quickly strengthening its own economic ties in Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America through its \u201cone belt, one road\u201d policy, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank (formerly known as the BRICS bank), and its own regional free-trade proposal to rival the TPP. If the US gives up on its Asian allies such as the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, those countries may have no choice but to prostrate themselves before China; and other US allies, such as Japan and India, may be forced to militarize and challenge China openly. Thus, an American withdrawal from the region could very well eventually precipitate a military conflict there. As in the 1930s, when protectionist and isolationist US policies hampered global economic growth and trade and created the conditions for rising revisionist powers to start a world war, similar policy impulses could set the stage for new powers to challenge and undermine the American-led international order. An isolationist Trump administration may see the wide oceans to its east and west, and think that increasingly ambitious powers such as Russia, China, and Iran pose no direct threat to the homeland. But the US is still a global economic and financial power in a deeply interconnected world. If left unchecked, these countries will eventually be able to threaten core US economic and security interests \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 especially if they expand their nuclear and cyberwarfare capacities. The historical record is clear: protectionism, isolationism, and \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies are a recipe for economic and military disaster.", ""], "id": "5fe0c52582c24bed52b7adf6a51ace0793dce741b595c22cda1ee9f98e07b19c", "highlighted_text": "policies that hinder trade helped sow the seeds of World War II.

But one issue could bring Democrats and Republicans together: infrastructure. A bipartisan bill that invests in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, especially its public transit systems, would have wide-ranging benefits for workers, businesses and the economy. For U.S. commuters and communities, underfunded roads, bridges and public transit systems aren\u2019t a matter of political opinion \u2014 they\u2019re a fact of life. In its latest Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) graded the nation\u2019s bridges a meager C+. In fact, for every 27 miles of U.S. highway, there is one structurally deficient bridge. Americans cross faulty interstate bridges 60 million times a day. Our roads are in even worse shape, earning a D from the civil engineers. One in every five miles of U.S. highway is crumbling. These poorly maintained roads are one reason why Americans spend 6.9 billion hours a year sitting in traffic at a cost of $160 billion in wasted time and fuel. But the most urgent transportation crisis involves our public transit systems. Years of underinvestment have resulted in an inadequate public transit infrastructure that garnered a D-, the lowest grade received in any category. Thirty-seven percent of public transportation stations need to be modernized. The same is true of 35 percent of track and fixed guideways. Add it all up, and America faces a public transit maintenance backlog of more than $90 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That\u2019s just for modernization. It doesn\u2019t include investment in the new public transportation services and facilities that our growing country needs. And because of these underfunded public transit systems, chronic commuting delays have made workers less productive, suppressing economic growth in the process. Indeed, the public transit maintenance backlog is expected to cost the country $180 billion in lost gross national product through 2023. . Fortunately, Congress and the administration have both expressed interest in addressing our nation\u2019s infrastructure. In March 2017, President Donald J. Trump called for a $1 trillion infrastructure package. He has since increased that figure to $1.7 trillion. The American Public Transportation Association has identified at least $232 billion in projects that could be addressed through a new infrastructure bill. Democrats are just as enthusiastic. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have called infrastructure a top priority for the new Congress. And new House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., is pushing for \u201creal money, real investment\u201d to address infrastructure issues by July. Republicans in Congress are also on board. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last November that he\u2019s willing to find a bipartisan solution to America\u2019s infrastructure woes. Investing in America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure is one of the few areas where the administration and Congress can find common ground.

This is the area, though, where the change in House majority may give the Democrats the fewest realistic opportunities. Because of the fractious nature of the Republican caucus in recent years, the Republican leadership has never been confident in their ability to pass spending bills without substantial Democratic support. Too many \u201cTea Party\u201d or \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201d Republican members have been unwilling to accept compromise outcomes pulling them off their ideological starting points on issues like defense spending, funding for Obamacare and other entitlement programs, and appropriations related to immigration and enforcement, including President Trump\u2019s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. As a result, Democrats have been relatively successful in protecting core appropriations interests from the minority. It is likely the President who sees the most improved tactical opportunities with the flip of the House. For the first two budget cycles of his Presidency, he has been unable to deliver on campaign promises including funding the wall and defunding Obamacare despite Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. He has often been happy to disparage members and even other leaders of his own party and even triggered a very brief and partial government shutdown in 2018, but the stark fact of Republican majorities has limited his ability to pass blame for unfulfilled promises. With Democrats now in control of the House, he may see advantages in taking hard line positions and risking more severe shutdowns, banking on conventional wisdom that the legislative party fares worse in the politics of failed budget negotiations. President Trump may also have openings to highlight divisions within the Democratic majority on national security issues. While some Democrats look for cuts to defense budgets, others will not want to be seen as weak on defense or unsupportive of the military. In a different vein, while there has historically been broad bipartisan support for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Democrats have been critical of the reckless way Trump did it. Trump may be able to use proposals for funding Embassy construction to claim a bipartisan mantle for the move. Democrats will likely look to do three things to address the conundrum of having new apparent responsibility with little new real power on budgetary issues. First, they will focus on their most important priorities. Most of these will be domestic, related to protecting entitlement spending. The priorities most closely related to foreign affairs will involve immigration, and especially limiting funds available for President Trump to pursue policies the Democrats see as anathema to American values, such as family separations at the border and the border wall. Second, they will play defense against Republican charges of extremism and intransigence, carefully building a public case that their desired budget outcomes better reflect public desires than Trump\u2019s unpopular priorities, like defunding Obamacare. At the same time, they will want to document their willingness to compromise on less existential issues in order to deflect blame for failed budget bills, government shutdowns, and other dramas voters tend to find distasteful. Finally, they will look for chances to use their control of the budget drafting process to score smaller wins. For example, the budget passed in September 2018 includes $65 million for a new low-yield nuclear weapons system despised by most progressive experts. Democrats may try to defund this kind of program in a broader campaign to highlight public concerns about President Trump\u2019s trustworthiness in managing his nuclear weapons authorities. Similarly, the House is likely to try to use budgetary and oversight powers to press the Administration to spend appropriations the Administration does not want, like fully staffing the State Department and providing traditional levels of support for international organizations.", ""], "id": "958f97abee0a5ceb29d2d59125de9fe275e371629801ac3449ae0566cc907281", "highlighted_text": "many Republican have been unwilling to accept compromise pulling them off ideological starting points on issues like defense spending With Democrats in control of the House , the legislative party fares worse Trump may highlight divisions within the Dem majority on national security some Democrats look for cuts to defense budgets, others will not want to be seen as weak on defense Dem s will likely focus on their priorities.

Crumbling water systems that are unreliable can shut down production lines. Congested highways mean late deliveries, production loss, increased fuel and wage costs and excessive wear on assets. Port congestion, lock delays and the penalty associated with not having infrastructure in place to handle larger ships make American products more expensive. Before I address the benefits of an infrastructure upgrade, let\u2019s take a look at the state of our aging infrastructure: Water and Sewer Beneath most major cities, our current water and sewer distribution systems are from 50 to 150 years old\u2014mostly beyond their design life and in need of replacement. The old systems are leaking an estimated 20 to 25% of our public water every year. Washington D.C. alone sees an average of 400 to 500 water main breaks per year, and an estimated 240,000 water main breaks occur every year in the U.S. The EPA estimates that upgrading the public water system will require $335 billion over 20 years, and upgrading the sewer systems will require $298 billion over 20 years. Bridges According to the Society of Civil Engineers, more than 9% of U.S. bridges are structurally deficient. There have been 600 bridge failures in the U.S. since 1989, several of them deadly. The federal government estimates the cost of a backlog of planned bridge rehabilitation projects at $123 billion per year. Highways The U.S. Department of Transportation says that over two thirds of our roads are in \u201cdire need of repair and upgrades.\u201d Traffic jams and congestion cost commuters 4.2 billion hours and about 2.8 million gallons of gasoline per year. In the past, we relied mostly on the Highway Trust Fund\u2014which supplies 80% of highway funds\u2014but the highway fund is running out of money. The gas tax has not been increased since 1973 and since 2008, the trust fund has spent $103 billion more than it has collected. Spending in 2018 alone is expected to exceed revenues by $9 billion. In addition, the 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 Infrastructure Report Card shows funding gaps for airports, inland waterways, dams, electricity, schools, rail, public parks, levees and hazardous waste. This adds up to a whopping $3.5 trillion in unfunded infrastructure costs. \u201cDoing nothing on infrastructure,\" says the ASCE, would mean a loss of $3.9 trillion in GDP and the loss of 2.5 million jobs by 2025\u201d. Public/Private Investment In a 2017 speech to Congress, President Trump said he wanted a $1.5 trillion investment in infrastructure rebuilding because it would create \"millions of new jobs\". His plan is to use federal funding for 20% of project costs. An additional $1.3 trillion would come from the states and private investors. \u201cFor too long, lawmakers have invested in infrastructure inefficiently, ignored critical needs, and allowed it to deteriorate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs a result, the United States has fallen further and further behind other countries.\u201d This public/private funding plan is still very vague and could include purchasing public assets. It would allow private investors to build, own and operate airports, bridges, tunnels, treatment plants, drinking water systems, highway rest stops, and dams. It could also increase highway tolls, and, of course, the private firms would be able to increase fees to the consumers to cover their costs. Trump has also said that any infrastructure plan must be revenue-neutral, meaning it cannot add to the federal deficit, and not require a tax increase. That raises the question: Where will the public money come from? Depending on private funds is also not especially practical. In our current economic trend toward financialization of the economy and short-term profits, the financial sector does not look favorably on investing in long-term profits. Some of these projects are very large and could take 10 to 15 years to complete. Financial investors do not like waiting years to get their money back. Plus, there is a question about project risks if something goes wrong with the project. Many private investors will want their projects underwritten by the government and have assurance that the U.S. taxpayers will bail them out, just like they bailed out the big banks in 2007. One idea being bounced around by administration is the idea of offering private investor tax credits. This has never been tried before and comes with significant risks. Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, and Peter Navarro, head of the national Trade Council, have recommended that the government allocate $137 million in tax credits for private investors to underwrite infrastructure projects. They estimated that these credits would spur $1 trillion in investment. But, there is considerable skepticism from free-market-oriented investors who want quicker returns and revenue streams during the project. Business and labor executives told a House transportation committee in February of 2017 that \u201cprivate investment won\u2019t provide nearly enough to address America\u2019s infrastructure woes.\u201d What might help get infrastructure rebuilding off the ground would be to raise the gas tax. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, would like to see a 25-cent increase in the gas tax, which has not increased since 1993. This tax increase would generate $394 billion in new revenue. But the Koch brothers and other hard-right GOP leaders in Congress are against any tax increases. So if the Trump infrastructure plan cannot raise taxes and must be revenue-neutral, where will the money come from? So far, the Trump infrastructure rebuilding program does not have a funding solution and does not yet offer specifics or priorities in infrastructure spending. Trump wants $1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure, and Congress has, so far, only allocated $21 billion. This is about 1% of the president\u2019s request. So Trump\u2019s proposed public/private infrastructure plan has become fake news. Infrastructure Investment Is a Big Opportunity Despite the political and economic backsliding, rebuilding our infrastructure is perhaps the best economic investment we could make in the 21st Century. In no other major economic investment could we achieve the number of new jobs, increased GDP growth, and immediate safety gains. Dan DiMicco, chairman emeritus of Nucor steel and a trade advisor to President Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, said it best a few years ago. \u201cI know that Americans are worried about the national debt I know they worry about government waste,\u201d DiMicco said. \u201cBut infrastructure is not waste. In the context of competing globally, the supposed costs are quickly overshadowed by the benefits. The investment is going to pay off not just 5 to 19 years from now, but 30 or 40 years from now as well.\u201d A 2014 study by the University of Maryland for the National Association of Manufacturers concluded that an \u201c$83 billion infrastructure investment package\u2014the equivalent of approximately 0.6 percent of GDP\u2014would create 1.7 million jobs in the first three years, accounting for both direct and indirect employment effects.\u201d In the shorter term, the manufacturing sector would directly benefit from supplying the materials for the infrastructure upgrade: concrete and asphalt for highways, pipes for drinking and wastewater, new towers for electrical grids, etc. A study by the Economic Policy Institute suggests that a debt-financed $250 billion annual investment in infrastructure would boost GDP by $400 billion and overall employment by 3 million net new jobs by the end of the first year. Now that Congress has just increased the Federal deficit by passing corporate tax cuts, there will be pushback against any kind of government spending. But we need to ask ourselves, why is it that we had enough money to fund the corporate tax cut in 2018 ($1.5 trillion), the Iraq War ($2. 4 trillion), and bank bailout ($4.4 trillion), but do not have the money to invest in our own country? This is an opportunity to modernize the country for all citizens, businesses, and economic sectors.

But one issue could bring Democrats and Republicans together: infrastructure. A bipartisan bill that invests in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, especially its public transit systems, would have wide-ranging benefits for workers, businesses and the economy. For U.S. commuters and communities, underfunded roads, bridges and public transit systems aren\u2019t a matter of political opinion \u2014 they\u2019re a fact of life. In its latest Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) graded the nation\u2019s bridges a meager C+. In fact, for every 27 miles of U.S. highway, there is one structurally deficient bridge. Americans cross faulty interstate bridges 60 million times a day. Our roads are in even worse shape, earning a D from the civil engineers. One in every five miles of U.S. highway is crumbling. These poorly maintained roads are one reason why Americans spend 6.9 billion hours a year sitting in traffic at a cost of $160 billion in wasted time and fuel. But the most urgent transportation crisis involves our public transit systems. Years of underinvestment have resulted in an inadequate public transit infrastructure that garnered a D-, the lowest grade received in any category. Thirty-seven percent of public transportation stations need to be modernized. The same is true of 35 percent of track and fixed guideways. Add it all up, and America faces a public transit maintenance backlog of more than $90 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That\u2019s just for modernization. It doesn\u2019t include investment in the new public transportation services and facilities that our growing country needs. And because of these underfunded public transit systems, chronic commuting delays have made workers less productive, suppressing economic growth in the process. Indeed, the public transit maintenance backlog is expected to cost the country $180 billion in lost gross national product through 2023. . Fortunately, Congress and the administration have both expressed interest in addressing our nation\u2019s infrastructure. In March 2017, President Donald J. Trump called for a $1 trillion infrastructure package. He has since increased that figure to $1.7 trillion. The American Public Transportation Association has identified at least $232 billion in projects that could be addressed through a new infrastructure bill. Democrats are just as enthusiastic. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have called infrastructure a top priority for the new Congress. And new House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., is pushing for \u201creal money, real investment\u201d to address infrastructure issues by July. Republicans in Congress are also on board. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last November that he\u2019s willing to find a bipartisan solution to America\u2019s infrastructure woes. Investing in America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure is one of the few areas where the administration and Congress can find common ground. It will take bipartisanship to deliver better roads, bridges, and public transit systems. To achieve the long-overdue infrastructure improvements America needs, Congressional lawmakers and the administration will need to do some traveling of their own\u2014across the aisle."], "id": "429379ba770bb9ae87192dbff5528f1f0f58c1cb36c6c1f7e8319079f6b49fe8", "highlighted_text": "A bill that invests in infrastructure would have wide-ranging benefits for workers, businesses and the economy.

This is the area, though, where the change in House majority may give the Democrats the fewest realistic opportunities. Because of the fractious nature of the Republican caucus in recent years, the Republican leadership has never been confident in their ability to pass spending bills without substantial Democratic support. Too many \u201cTea Party\u201d or \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201d Republican members have been unwilling to accept compromise outcomes pulling them off their ideological starting points on issues like defense spending, funding for Obamacare and other entitlement programs, and appropriations related to immigration and enforcement, including President Trump\u2019s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. As a result, Democrats have been relatively successful in protecting core appropriations interests from the minority. It is likely the President who sees the most improved tactical opportunities with the flip of the House. For the first two budget cycles of his Presidency, he has been unable to deliver on campaign promises including funding the wall and defunding Obamacare despite Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. He has often been happy to disparage members and even other leaders of his own party and even triggered a very brief and partial government shutdown in 2018, but the stark fact of Republican majorities has limited his ability to pass blame for unfulfilled promises. With Democrats now in control of the House, he may see advantages in taking hard line positions and risking more severe shutdowns, banking on conventional wisdom that the legislative party fares worse in the politics of failed budget negotiations. President Trump may also have openings to highlight divisions within the Democratic majority on national security issues. While some Democrats look for cuts to defense budgets, others will not want to be seen as weak on defense or unsupportive of the military. In a different vein, while there has historically been broad bipartisan support for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Democrats have been critical of the reckless way Trump did it. Trump may be able to use proposals for funding Embassy construction to claim a bipartisan mantle for the move. Democrats will likely look to do three things to address the conundrum of having new apparent responsibility with little new real power on budgetary issues. First, they will focus on their most important priorities. Most of these will be domestic, related to protecting entitlement spending. The priorities most closely related to foreign affairs will involve immigration, and especially limiting funds available for President Trump to pursue policies the Democrats see as anathema to American values, such as family separations at the border and the border wall. Second, they will play defense against Republican charges of extremism and intransigence, carefully building a public case that their desired budget outcomes better reflect public desires than Trump\u2019s unpopular priorities, like defunding Obamacare. At the same time, they will want to document their willingness to compromise on less existential issues in order to deflect blame for failed budget bills, government shutdowns, and other dramas voters tend to find distasteful. Finally, they will look for chances to use their control of the budget drafting process to score smaller wins.

If it\u2019s real, that is. I was trained as a physician and molecular biologist, and I have no idea which models or measures of temperature trends to trust. What I do know is that even if the earth is warming, and even if it\u2019s due to human activities, any significant lowering of emissions will be too costly, too little and too late. Reductions in the burning of fossil fuels sufficient to have even a modest impact would stifle economic growth and plunge the world into chaos. In any case, discernible effects on warming would be decades away. Actions to reduce emissions should only be undertaken if they\u2019re likely to be cost-effective, and they should be limited to measures that have desirable secondary effects as well; an example would be a shift from fossil fuels to nuclear power. Often it\u2019s wiser to try to adapt to or mitigate a problem than to try to remove its causes. Consider, for example, the solution that the U.K. adopted to prevent the flooding of London by surge tides that occur under certain meteorological conditions and because tide levels have been rising two feet per century. Rather than trying to eliminate the source of these tides, between 1974 and 1984 the U.K. constructed the Thames Barrier, an innovative monumental system of movable floodgates that prevents the flooding. Similarly, in the short term, we should focus our efforts and resources on becoming more resilient and adaptive. An insightful article in the journal Nature by University of Colorado Environmental Studies Professor Roger Pielke Jr. and his collaborators pointed out that \u201cvulnerability to climate-related impacts on society is increasing for reasons that have nothing to do with greenhouse-gas emissions, such as rapid population growth along coasts and in areas with limited water supplies.\u201d Nevertheless, the authors observe that many activists regard adaptation as being necessary only because we aren\u2019t sufficiently aggressive in preventing greenhouse-gas emissions. And they are completely correct in saying that because \u201cmost projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change are marginal increases on already huge losses,\u201d applying adaptation only to that narrow margin makes no sense. They cite the example of the Philippines, where policymakers are wringing their hands about a possible gradual climate-change-mediated rise in sea level from 1 to 3 millimeters per year while ignoring the primary cause of enhanced flood risk. The reason for the rise in sea level: \u201cexcessive groundwater extraction, which is lowering the land surface by several centimeters to more than a decimeter [about 4 inches] per year.\u201d Perhaps more attention should be paid to ways to reduce groundwater extraction, such as desalination, wastewater treatment and recycling, collection of rainwater and the cultivation of crops that require less irrigation.In a similar vein, the authors observe that \u201cnon-climate factors are by far the most important drivers of increased risk to tropical disease,\u201d although such risk \u201cis repeatedly invoked by climate-mitigation advocates as a key reason to curb emissions.\u201d They cite a study that found that without factoring in the effects of climate change, \u201cthe global population at risk from malaria would increase by 100% by 2080, whereas the effect of climate change would increase the risk of malaria by at most 7%.\u201dPielke and his colleagues criticize \u201cthe political obsession with the idea that climate risks can be reduced by cutting emissions,\u201d because it \u201cdistracts attention\u201d from other, more cost-effective approaches. (They might have added that the economic and humanitarian costs would be astronomical, perhaps unprecedented in history.) However, for many activists, emissions reduction has become an article of faith in the church of radical environmentalism: Al Gore dismissed adaptation as \u201ca kind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins.He couldn\u2019t be more wrong. For example, a cheap, highly effective, timely\u2013and adaptive\u2013approach to malaria (and other mosquito-borne diseases) is available. The key is the elimination of the mosquito, but fundamental shortcomings in public policy have made unavailable the most potent weapon in our arsenal: DDT, an inexpensive and effective pesticide once widely deployed to kill disease-carrying insects. In 1972, on the basis of data on toxicity to fish and migrating birds (but not to humans), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned virtually all uses of DDT.Not only did government regulators underplay scientific evidence of the effectiveness and relative safety of DDT, they also failed to appreciate the distinction between its large-scale use in agriculture and more limited application for controlling carriers of human disease. Although DDT is a (modestly) toxic substance, there is a world of difference between applying large amounts of it in the environment\u2013as farmers did before it was banned\u2013and applying it carefully and sparingly to fight mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects.Doctrinaire activism and command-and-control policymaking are inimical to resilience; they jeopardize our survival as individuals and our success as a society. There is plenty of blame to go around. Politicians tend to be short-term thinkers, their purview often limited to the next election, and many of them seem to care less about the public interest than about scoring political points. Moreover, many of them are just not very smart, and they\u2019re particularly challenged in the realms of science and logic. If individually and collectively we are to meet economic, environmental and public health challenges, we need plenty of options and opportunities for innovation\u2013and the wealth to pursue them. In society, as in biology, survival demands adaptation. But in large and small ways, unimaginative, shortsighted politicians and venal activists have conspired to limit our options, constrain economic growth and make real solutions elusive.

That new reality naturally conjures up painful thoughts of two more years of fighting rather than fixing, two more years of partisan acrimony, and two more years of gridlock. But none of that has to be the case. In fact, Congress has operated well in the past when its power was divided between the two major political parties. After all, checks and balances are what the Founders desired. The reason may be that a divided Congress forces the parties to work together and share responsibility. Some of the most impactful legislation enacted by Congress in our lifetimes \u2013 the Cold War response to the Soviet threat, our federal highway system, civil rights legislation, tax reform, Social Security reform, welfare reform, the post-9/11 response to terror -- came from bipartisan leadership. In fact, one could argue that enduring legislation is unlikely without bipartisan support. So to those who argue that Congress will inevitably slide down a rut of inaction, remember that inaction/gridlock is a choice \u2013 and for Congress, it\u2019s the worst one. Congress \u2013 regardless of who controls it \u2013 is today less popular than the flu. The reason is simple: It routinely fails to address the nation\u2019s priorities because it consistently chooses party and ideology over problem-solving. We the people have grown numb to Congress failing to fulfill its basic responsibilities \u2013 not passing budgets, not working together on national security and intelligence matters and not discharging its responsibilities in a fair and thoughtful way. If the 116th Congress wants to succeed, it will have to prove to voters it can do the basic work entrusted to it by the Constitution, and address the intractable problems of the nation. Where is the agenda that will stimulate and animate a respected, responsible and productive Congress? Look first for areas where there is real agreement between the parties, even though they don\u2019t acknowledge it. For example, our nation\u2019s infrastructure is a mess \u2013 roads, bridges, rail, airports and seaports are overstressed and under-capitalized. We need an infrastructure overhaul, and both parties have good reasons to support one. The incoming Congress could also take on the issue of privacy and technology \u2013 an area where most Americans and both parties are right to demand more accountability from big technology companies. Congress could also produce sensible and bipartisan immigration reform, if the majority of members have the will. For too long, the extremes in both parties have defined the debate over immigration for their political benefit. And yet, majorities in both parties support a balanced package that could pass. The details will matter, and there will be many moments when emotions will rule the day, but this much is clear: Most Americans are tired of our broken immigration and citizenship system and would welcome reform. None of this is possible without leadership, beginning with the White House. President Trump will have to play a mediating role \u2013 tamping down the harsh rhetoric he has deployed against political opponents. Can he do it? That\u2019s up to him. But I\u2019ve never met a president preparing for a tough re-election who didn\u2019t care what the public wants [ -- and if exit polls are to be believed, the independents who sided with Democratic candidates want a softening of his rhetoric at the very least]. If Americans demand a productive, bipartisan Congress, the president can help make it happen. President Trump is not the only one who has to change. For too long, leaders in both parties have grown accustomed to hyper-partisanship. It can seem from the sound of things that our nation\u2019s political leaders are trained to achieve one goal \u2013 to hurt the other side. That\u2019s not what they were chosen to do. There are whole armies of enablers to this culture of dislike \u2013 not just members of Congress, but their staff, single-issue partisans and the many media pundits. There\u2019s good money to be made from Washington\u2019s civil wars, even though it comes at the expense of the entire nation. But I am confident that the president, working with leaders at the top of each party, can build a new culture in Washington, if they want to. That culture would make room for debate and disagreement, but ultimately would lead to collaboration and coordination on important issues that matter to all Americans. We need a Congress that takes seriously, for example, its Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense, to hold committee hearings on judicial nominees that don\u2019t devolve into screaming matches, and to hold discussions of new problems that afflict our nation, such as the opioid epidemic. The future of America depends on constructive action on these important problems. We can expect differences of opinion but we cannot accept partisan and mutual denigration. Americans have seen Congress function reasonably well in the past, so we know there is a better way to do the people\u2019s business. It\u2019s time for Congress \u2013 both parties \u2013 to do it."], "id": "6400b64d5e294d0b3ac6f9a9ba2eb46cb3efc150645dc3ac56f4171021f9bffa", "highlighted_text": "America will have divided government But Congress has operated well when power was divided federal highway system civil rights legislation came bipartisan We need an overhaul, and both parties support one leaders have grown accustomed to hyper-partisanship But the president with leaders of each party, can build a new culture", "highlights": [[2, 28, 35], [2, 45, 49], [2, 55, 59], [2, 62, 80], [2, 343, 346], [2, 389, 415], [2, 428, 432], [2, 437, 454], [2, 788, 810], [2, 812, 836], [2, 926, 930], [2, 936, 946], [2, 2229, 2239], [2, 2255, 2281], [2, 2303, 2314], [2, 3687, 3694], [2, 3711, 3754], [2, 4207, 4210], [2, 4231, 4244], [2, 4254, 4266], [2, 4278, 4316]], "underlines": [[2, 28, 35], [2, 45, 49], [2, 55, 59], [2, 62, 80], [2, 343, 346], [2, 389, 415], [2, 428, 432], [2, 437, 454], [2, 662, 787], [2, 788, 810], [2, 810, 811], [2, 812, 836], [2, 836, 925], [2, 926, 930], [2, 931, 935], [2, 936, 946], [2, 947, 958], [2, 1888, 1898], [2, 1899, 1908], [2, 1923, 1930], [2, 1971, 1979], [2, 2014, 2016], [2, 2105, 2108], [2, 2118, 2132], [2, 2229, 2239], [2, 2255, 2281], [2, 2303, 2314], [2, 3687, 3694], [2, 3711, 3754], [2, 4207, 4210], [2, 4231, 4244], [2, 4254, 4266], [2, 4278, 4316]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 3], [4, 13], [13, 41], [41, 45]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-11-07"}, {"tag": "No empirical examples of collapse solving \u2013 short term collapse leads to outlash of dirty fascists and sparks EVEN MORE GROWTH", "cite": "Kassiola 90 (Joel, Prof of Poli-Sci @ Brooklyn College, \u201cThe death of industrial civilization,\u201d p. 194, jam)", "body": ["Moreover, as a result of disappointment, Wildean tragedy, and value erosion, the postindustrial elite (the current members of the beneficiary class within the dominant, postindustrial social paradigm and structure) might come to a realization unique in history.

Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who is expected to chair the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee when Democrats assume the House majority next year, has a goal: producing a major infrastructure bill providing $500 billion for highways and transit, plus additional funding for airports and water projects. Democrats\u2019 gains in the Nov. 6 elections have quickly revived talk about infrastructure legislation. President Trump and Senate Democrats both floated big infrastructure investment plans early this year but Congress didn't act on them. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is seeking to be the next House Speaker, has said she wants to pursue a significant infrastructure measure in the new Congress. President Trump has said infrastructure might be one area that both political parties can agree on. As the head of the \u201cT&I\u201d committee, which has jurisdiction a wide range of types of infrastructure, DeFazio is likely to be a key player in such legislation. \u201cInfrastructure has been delayed too long,\u201d said DeFazio, a 31-year T&I member. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it done.

We\u2019ve got to modernize it and we\u2019ve got to move people and goods more efficiently.\u201d DeFazio wants to get an infrastructure package through the House in the first six months of 2019. But the key to advancing any major infrastructure measure is finding a way to pay for it that Congress can agree to. DeFazio noted that it would be up to the Ways and Means Committee to come up with a revenue plan. But in March 2017, he did introduce a plan of his own, the \u201cPenny for Progress\u201d bill, which would provide $500 billion for surface transportation over 13 years. Under the proposal, the Treasury would raise the $500 billion by issuing a new type of 30-year bonds. They would be repaid by increasing the federal gasoline and diesel taxes to account for highway construction cost inflation and from lower fuel usage because of federal fuel-economy standards. The bill hasn\u2019t moved in the current Congress. DeFazio isn\u2019t wedded to the Penny for Progress approach. \u201cI\u2019m open to any and all options on how we get real funds for infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has to be real money.\u201d By \"real money,\" he means direct federal revenue, not private-sector dollars, which were a major element of Trump's plan."], "id": "1181d03fac963bc93c87477dc935cb91835213b807ef1226f6f800a6a9933121", "highlighted_text": "Ichniowski 11-7 DeFazio expected to chair the Infrastructure Committee has a goal a infrastructure bill DeFazio is likely to be a key player wants an infrastructure package through the House in the first six months of 2019 DeFazio it would be up to Ways and Means Committee to introduce a plan the \u201cPenny for Progress\u201d bill, would provide $500 billion billion by issuing new 30-year bonds repaid by increasing gasoline taxes", "highlights": [[2, 4, 14], [2, 41, 45], [3, 11, 18], [3, 36, 47], [3, 48, 53], [3, 54, 57], [3, 77, 91], [3, 92, 101], [3, 154, 164], [3, 176, 177], [3, 184, 203], [3, 929, 936], [3, 937, 965], [3, 1212, 1217], [3, 1225, 1250], [3, 1251, 1300], [3, 1419, 1426], [3, 1438, 1455], [3, 1460, 1487], [3, 1543, 1552], [3, 1553, 1559], [3, 1572, 1602], [3, 1609, 1635], [3, 1732, 1750], [3, 1753, 1756], [3, 1765, 1778], [3, 1794, 1814], [3, 1827, 1835], [3, 1847, 1852]], "underlines": [[3, 11, 18], [3, 36, 47], [3, 48, 53], [3, 54, 57], [3, 77, 91], [3, 92, 101], [3, 154, 164], [3, 176, 177], [3, 184, 203], [3, 929, 936], [3, 937, 965], [3, 1212, 1217], [3, 1225, 1250], [3, 1251, 1300], [3, 1419, 1426], [3, 1438, 1455], [3, 1460, 1487], [3, 1543, 1552], [3, 1553, 1559], [3, 1572, 1602], [3, 1609, 1635], [3, 1732, 1750], [3, 1753, 1756], [3, 1765, 1778], [3, 1794, 1814], [3, 1827, 1835], [3, 1847, 1852]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2006-01-01"}, {"tag": "A2 Gridlock Thumps", "cite": "Zachary Halaschak, Washington Examiner 4-14-2019 [\"Trump, Pelosi agree to huddle on bipartisan infrastructure package available online at:  https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-pelosi-agree-to-huddle-on-bipartisan-infrastructure-package accessed - 4-17-2019]cdm", "body": ["In a political climate thick with gridlock, there might be some compromise in the near future.

Despite the fact that the two houses of Congress will be controlled by different parties, some are hoping that the president's self-professed dealmaking skills might help avoid legislative stasis over the next two years. \"The one good thing as far as legislative progress goes is that Mr Trump does not have any deep philosophical policy principles that would prevent him striking a deal if he thought it was good for him,\" said Mark Peterson, professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the possibilities for Mr Trump would be to resurrect proposed legislation that would allow for a huge increase in public spending on infrastructure such as rail and roads. Under plans he unveiled this year, the government would spend more than $US200 billion over the next 10 years repairing parks, building roads and improving public transport. That bill died as campaign politics took over, with the administration becoming distracted by other matters and the Democrats unwilling to give the president a victory so close to the vote. Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, said: \"Divided government sometimes creates opportunities that were not as substantial as during one-party government, and I think infrastructure would be at the top of the list.\" Agreeing funding for the plan, however, is likely to be the biggest hurdle, with fiscal hawks in the Republican party already concerned about the rapidly rising federal deficit.

Pelosi, at a press conference during the Democrats\u20192019 Issues Conference, said she hopes to find common ground with Trump on immigration as well as Infrastructure spending and prescription drug pricing. The president wants to deport illegal immigrants, further restrict access to asylum seekers and cut down categories of family-based visas available for immigrants to enter the country legally. Democrats want to continue to welcome migrants seeking refuge into the country and find a path for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country to stay here legally. It\u2019s a wide gap to bridge on a topic that Trump clearly wants to use to highlight differences between him and his eventual Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential contest. There\u2019s little reason to believe Republicans and Democrats could work together on even the smallest of immigration matters \u2014 let alone a massive overhaul \u2014 before then. But Pelosi believes it\u2019s possible. \u201cI\u2019m always optimistic,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cAnd this has to happen. It\u2019s inevitable. Again, it\u2019s inevitable to some, inconceivable to others. We have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable.\u201d Despite expressing hope that the president will come to the table for bipartisan immigration talks, Pelosi also acknowledged that he\u2019s used the topic for political purposes. \u201cThe president is a fearmonger. He fueled the flame of insecurity about globalization, about immigration in the campaign. \u2026 But if the economy is better for some of these people, I think that fear tactic will be diminished,\u201d she said. Democrats\u2019 strategy in the 2018 midterms was to largely ignore the GOP\u2019s immigration fearmongering and to focus on economic issues like health care, infrastructure and job creation. Pelosi says that\u2019s all part of laying the groundwork for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which she noted is the \u201cbest thing we can do to grow the economy.\u201d \u201cOur view of how we go forward is if we can change people\u2019s financial security \u2026 if we can give people confidence, end some of their insecurities about their own economic situation, I think there will be a better atmosphere among some who are opposed to immigration in the country,\u201d she said. The speaker said that the bipartisan, bicameral fiscal 2019 spending package Congress passed and Trump signed in February contained the formula for the president to \u201cbring order to the border.\u201d But she contends he\u2019s not tapped those financial resources, much of them were focused on the humanitarian challenges stemming from the growing number of asylum seekers and other migrants trying to cross the border. \u201cHe has not utilized what is in that specifically to the border,\u201d Pelosi said. Trump recently threatened to close the border because of his frustration about the influx of migrants, but he backed off that amid broad, bipartisan opposition to the idea. \u2018Of course there\u2019s room\u2019 The president has continued his harsh rhetoric about immigrants. Last week, as he visited the border, Trump said the system was too full to accept anyone new. \u201cWe don\u2019t have room,\u201d he said. Pelosi was aghast at that remark. \u201cMy God, I thought it was Mary and Joseph at Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no room. There is no room at the inn. What is this? Of course there\u2019s room.\u201d One of the largest obstacles to Democrats and Republicans finding common ground on immigration is Trump\u2019s insistence on building out a wall along the southern border, which Democrats object to as immoral. Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders during the shutdown when Pelosi told him bluntly that Democrats wouldn\u2019t provide any funding for a wall. Pelosi says she has spoken to Trump about immigration since then, but just to say \u201cthat we have to do comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d She did not characterize his response. What Pelosi and Trump have spoken more frequently about is working together to lower prescription drug prices and invest in the nation\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cLeft to his own devices, I think sometimes the president would be agreeable to these things,\u201d Pelosi said. Although the speaker noted, she \u201cpoo-pooed\u201d his $200 billion proposed federal investment for an infrastructure package. Pelosi is looking for a minimum of five times that amount, saying an infrastructure package \u201chas to be at least $1 trillion\u201d of federal funding. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be closer to $2 trillion,\u201d she said, but noted it\u2019s all about how you leverage the money. \u201cWhatever number is agreed upon, we have to stretch it to the limit.\u201d", ""], "id": "d7aba3a84887221d6bf2e553035d747834e45b7763a328715d9a8b41811acbc5", "highlighted_text": "Pelosi expressed optimism that her party can work on a comprehensive immigration overhaul Pelosi, hopes to find common ground on immigration Infrastructure spending and drug pricing Pelosi believes it\u2019s possible this has to happen.

States awarded implementation grants would be able to funnel funding to specific local and tribal governments. The legislation would also create a 15-person committee to review grants and resiliency plans, and keep tabs on how states are spending the grants.

It's too soon to know whether Braun will carry on his predecessor's tradition of reaching across the aisle. It's no surprise, though, that Young was ninth in the Lugar/McCourt Senate rankings. Though he has customarily lined up with his party and President Donald Trump during his first two years in the Senate, Young on occasion takes on causes that transcend political parties and ideologies.

Administration officials said they would alert Congress that the money, which had already been approved, would not be spent to fix water systems, clear rubble or dig up unexploded mines in Syrian cities and towns that have been devastated by the war. Those repairs were seen as vital to persuading hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to return home \u2014 people the Trump administration has largely barred from resettling in the United States. The unspent funds are part of nearly $3 billion in foreign aid \u2014 money allocated last year by Congress with broad bipartisan support \u2014 that the administration has so far refused to spend and could rescind or send back to the Treasury. In the case of the Syria money, the administration has decided to spend it on other yet-to-be-determined priorities, not return it to the Treasury, officials said. The languishing billions are a reflection of President Trump\u2019s belief that the rest of the world needs to be weaned off its reliance on aid from the United States. The decision on the Syria money will disappoint European and Persian Gulf allies, and the dominant position of Russia and Iran in Syria will be strengthened by a reduced American commitment. Pentagon officials have quietly expressed exasperation over the decision, fearing that any failure to stabilize Syria will leave fertile ground for the Islamic State or other extremists to return. The administration said that the move did not represent any pullback on American goals in Syria, and emphasized that other countries had committed $300 million to the Syrian stabilization effort, including $100 million from Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe president has made clear that we are prepared to remain in Syria until the enduring defeat of ISIS, and we remain focused on ensuring the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their proxies,\u201d said the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert.

Crumbling water systems that are unreliable can shut down production lines. Congested highways mean late deliveries, production loss, increased fuel and wage costs and excessive wear on assets. Port congestion, lock delays and the penalty associated with not having infrastructure in place to handle larger ships make American products more expensive. Before I address the benefits of an infrastructure upgrade, let\u2019s take a look at the state of our aging infrastructure: Water and Sewer Beneath most major cities, our current water and sewer distribution systems are from 50 to 150 years old\u2014mostly beyond their design life and in need of replacement. The old systems are leaking an estimated 20 to 25% of our public water every year. Washington D.C. alone sees an average of 400 to 500 water main breaks per year, and an estimated 240,000 water main breaks occur every year in the U.S. The EPA estimates that upgrading the public water system will require $335 billion over 20 years, and upgrading the sewer systems will require $298 billion over 20 years. Bridges According to the Society of Civil Engineers, more than 9% of U.S. bridges are structurally deficient. There have been 600 bridge failures in the U.S. since 1989, several of them deadly. The federal government estimates the cost of a backlog of planned bridge rehabilitation projects at $123 billion per year. Highways The U.S. Department of Transportation says that over two thirds of our roads are in \u201cdire need of repair and upgrades.\u201d Traffic jams and congestion cost commuters 4.2 billion hours and about 2.8 million gallons of gasoline per year. In the past, we relied mostly on the Highway Trust Fund\u2014which supplies 80% of highway funds\u2014but the highway fund is running out of money. The gas tax has not been increased since 1973 and since 2008, the trust fund has spent $103 billion more than it has collected. Spending in 2018 alone is expected to exceed revenues by $9 billion. In addition, the 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 Infrastructure Report Card shows funding gaps for airports, inland waterways, dams, electricity, schools, rail, public parks, levees and hazardous waste. This adds up to a whopping $3.5 trillion in unfunded infrastructure costs. \u201cDoing nothing on infrastructure,\" says the ASCE, would mean a loss of $3.9 trillion in GDP and the loss of 2.5 million jobs by 2025\u201d. Public/Private Investment In a 2017 speech to Congress, President Trump said he wanted a $1.5 trillion investment in infrastructure rebuilding because it would create \"millions of new jobs\". His plan is to use federal funding for 20% of project costs. An additional $1.3 trillion would come from the states and private investors. \u201cFor too long, lawmakers have invested in infrastructure inefficiently, ignored critical needs, and allowed it to deteriorate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs a result, the United States has fallen further and further behind other countries.\u201d This public/private funding plan is still very vague and could include purchasing public assets. It would allow private investors to build, own and operate airports, bridges, tunnels, treatment plants, drinking water systems, highway rest stops, and dams. It could also increase highway tolls, and, of course, the private firms would be able to increase fees to the consumers to cover their costs. Trump has also said that any infrastructure plan must be revenue-neutral, meaning it cannot add to the federal deficit, and not require a tax increase. That raises the question: Where will the public money come from? Depending on private funds is also not especially practical. In our current economic trend toward financialization of the economy and short-term profits, the financial sector does not look favorably on investing in long-term profits. Some of these projects are very large and could take 10 to 15 years to complete. Financial investors do not like waiting years to get their money back. Plus, there is a question about project risks if something goes wrong with the project. Many private investors will want their projects underwritten by the government and have assurance that the U.S. taxpayers will bail them out, just like they bailed out the big banks in 2007. One idea being bounced around by administration is the idea of offering private investor tax credits. This has never been tried before and comes with significant risks. Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, and Peter Navarro, head of the national Trade Council, have recommended that the government allocate $137 million in tax credits for private investors to underwrite infrastructure projects. They estimated that these credits would spur $1 trillion in investment. But, there is considerable skepticism from free-market-oriented investors who want quicker returns and revenue streams during the project. Business and labor executives told a House transportation committee in February of 2017 that \u201cprivate investment won\u2019t provide nearly enough to address America\u2019s infrastructure woes.\u201d What might help get infrastructure rebuilding off the ground would be to raise the gas tax. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, would like to see a 25-cent increase in the gas tax, which has not increased since 1993. This tax increase would generate $394 billion in new revenue. But the Koch brothers and other hard-right GOP leaders in Congress are against any tax increases. So if the Trump infrastructure plan cannot raise taxes and must be revenue-neutral, where will the money come from? So far, the Trump infrastructure rebuilding program does not have a funding solution and does not yet offer specifics or priorities in infrastructure spending. Trump wants $1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure, and Congress has, so far, only allocated $21 billion. This is about 1% of the president\u2019s request. So Trump\u2019s proposed public/private infrastructure plan has become fake news. Infrastructure Investment Is a Big Opportunity Despite the political and economic backsliding, rebuilding our infrastructure is perhaps the best economic investment we could make in the 21st Century. In no other major economic investment could we achieve the number of new jobs, increased GDP growth, and immediate safety gains. Dan DiMicco, chairman emeritus of Nucor steel and a trade advisor to President Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, said it best a few years ago. \u201cI know that Americans are worried about the national debt I know they worry about government waste,\u201d DiMicco said. \u201cBut infrastructure is not waste. In the context of competing globally, the supposed costs are quickly overshadowed by the benefits. The investment is going to pay off not just 5 to 19 years from now, but 30 or 40 years from now as well.\u201d A 2014 study by the University of Maryland for the National Association of Manufacturers concluded that an \u201c$83 billion infrastructure investment package\u2014the equivalent of approximately 0.6 percent of GDP\u2014would create 1.7 million jobs in the first three years, accounting for both direct and indirect employment effects.\u201d In the shorter term, the manufacturing sector would directly benefit from supplying the materials for the infrastructure upgrade: concrete and asphalt for highways, pipes for drinking and wastewater, new towers for electrical grids, etc. A study by the Economic Policy Institute suggests that a debt-financed $250 billion annual investment in infrastructure would boost GDP by $400 billion and overall employment by 3 million net new jobs by the end of the first year. Now that Congress has just increased the Federal deficit by passing corporate tax cuts, there will be pushback against any kind of government spending. But we need to ask ourselves, why is it that we had enough money to fund the corporate tax cut in 2018 ($1.5 trillion), the Iraq War ($2. 4 trillion), and bank bailout ($4.4 trillion), but do not have the money to invest in our own country? This is an opportunity to modernize the country for all citizens, businesses, and economic sectors.

If the United States wants the international system to continue to reflect its interests and values -- a system, for example, in which the global commons are protected, trade is broad-based and extensive, and armed conflicts among great nations are curtailed -- it needs to sustain not just resolve, but relative power. That, in turn, will require acknowledging the uncomfortable truth that global power and wealth are shifting at an unprecedented pace, with profound implications. Moreover, many of the challenges America faces are exacerbated by vulnerabilities that are largely self-created, chief among them fiscal policy. Much more quickly and comprehensively than is understood, those vulnerabilities are reducing America's freedom of action and its ability to influence others. Preserving America's international position will require it to restore its economic vitality and make policy choices now that pay dividends for decades to come. America has to prioritize and to act.

Although all of these constitute potential or actual threats, the biggest challenges facing the US are its burgeoning debt, crumbling infrastructure, second-rate primary and secondary schools, outdated immigration system, and slow economic growth \u2013 in short, the domestic foundations of American power. Readers in other countries may be tempted to react to this judgment with a dose of schadenfreude, finding more than a little satisfaction in America\u2019s difficulties. Such a response should not be surprising. The US and those representing it have been guilty of hubris (the US may often be the indispensable nation, but it would be better if others pointed this out), and examples of inconsistency between America\u2019s practices and its principles understandably provoke charges of hypocrisy. When America does not adhere to the principles that it preaches to others, it breeds resentment. But, like most temptations, the urge to gloat at America\u2019s imperfections and struggles ought to be resisted. People around the globe should be careful what they wish for. America\u2019s failure to deal with its internal challenges would come at a steep price. Indeed, the rest of the world\u2019s stake in American success is nearly as large as that of the US itself. Part of the reason is economic. The US economy still accounts for about one-quarter of global output. If US growth accelerates, America\u2019s capacity to consume other countries\u2019 goods and services will increase, thereby boosting growth around the world. At a time when Europe is drifting and Asia is slowing, only the US (or, more broadly, North America) has the potential to drive global economic recovery. The US remains a unique source of innovation. Most of the world\u2019s citizens communicate with mobile devices based on technology developed in Silicon Valley; likewise, the Internet was made in America. More recently, new technologies developed in the US greatly increase the ability to extract oil and natural gas from underground formations. This technology is now making its way around the globe, allowing other societies to increase their energy production and decrease both their reliance on costly imports and their carbon emissions. The US is also an invaluable source of ideas. Its world-class universities educate a significant percentage of future world leaders. More fundamentally, the US has long been a leading example of what market economies anddemocratic politics can accomplish. People and governments around the world are far more likely to become more open if the American model is perceived to be succeeding. Finally, the world faces many serious challenges, ranging from the need to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction, fight climate change, and maintain a functioning world economic order that promotes trade and investment to regulating practices incyberspace, improving global health, and preventing armed conflicts. These problems will not simply go away or sort themselves out. While Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d may ensure the success of free markets, it ispowerless in the world of geopolitics. Order requires the visible hand of leadership to formulate and realize global responses to global challenges. Don\u2019t get me wrong: None of this is meant to suggest that the US can deal effectively with the world\u2019s problems on its own. Unilateralism rarely works. It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective responses stand a good chance of succeeding. But multilateralism is much easier to advocate than to design and implement. Right now there is only one candidate for this role: the US. No other country has the necessary combination of capability and outlook. This brings me back to the argument that the US must put its house in order \u2013 economically, physically, socially, and politically \u2013 if it is to have the resources needed to promote order in the world. Everyone should hope that it does: The alternative to a world led by the US is not a world led by China, Europe, Russia, Japan, India, or any other country, but rather a world that is not led at all. Such a world would almost certainly be characterized by chronic crisis and conflict. That would be bad not just for Americans, but for the vast majority of the planet\u2019s inhabitants.", ""], "id": "0ea09d60d1b5e1068c704120246281c59e6a72102f4720fe971469ea19e26ecf", "highlighted_text": "the biggest challenges facing the US are slow economic growth America\u2019s failure to deal with internal challenges would come at a steep price The US economy accounts for one-quarter of global output.

The greatest threat posed by the spread of nuclear weapons is nuclear war. The more states in possession of nuclear weapons, the greater the probability that somewhere, someday, there will be a catastrophic nuclear war. 23 To date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945, the United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the sixty-five-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear weapons are unusable, but it would be na\u00efve to think that nuclear weapons will never be used again simply because they have not been used for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide economic downturns like the great depression were a thing of the past, only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade and the Great Recession of the late Naughts.49 This author, for one, would be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his lifetime. Before reaching a state of MAD, new nuclear states go through a transition period in which they lack a secure-second strike capability. In this context, one or both states might believe that it has an incentive to use nuclear weapons first. For example, if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a secure, secondstrike capability. Even though it is believed to have a large arsenal, given its small size and lack of strategic depth, Israel might not be confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and respond with a devastating counterstrike.

Rather, this title goes to the ongoing, slow-motion catastrophe of anthropogenic climate change \u2014 a phenomenon that threatens not just the future prosperity of the U.S., but the survival of the entire global village. The fact is that climate change will result in a range of catastrophic consequences, including extreme heat waves, the spread of infectious disease, megadroughts, coastal flooding, desertification, food supply disruptions, widespread biodiversity loss (e.g., the sixth mass extinction), mass migrations, social unrest and political instability \u2014 to name just a few. And multiple high-ranking U.S. officials have affirmed a causal connection between climate change and terrorism. For example, John Brennan, the current Director of the CIA, recently stated that \u201cthe impact of climate change\u201d is one of the \u201cdeeper causes of this rising instability\u201d in countries like Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Yemen and Libya. Similarly, Chuck Hagel, the former secretary of defense, describes climate change as a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d that \u201chas the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today \u2014 from infectious disease to terrorism.\u201d And the Department of Defense notes in a 2015 report that \u201cGlobal climate change will aggravate problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions that threaten stability in a number of countries.\u201d Consider some recent data that underline the fact that climate change is a \u201cclear and present danger.\u201d As of this writing, the hottest month on record was last February. It completely \u201cobliterated\u201d the previous \u201call-time global temperature record\u201d set by \u2014 take a guess \u2014 January 2016. And January 2016 beat the previous records set by October, November and December 2015. Similarly, the hottest 16 years on record have all occurred since 2000, with only a single exception (1998). The current record-holder is 2015, followed by 2014, 2010 and 2013, but it appears that 2016 could be even hotter than 2015. This being said, climate change isn\u2019t just a \u201cpresent\u201d danger with implications for human well-being this century. As a 2016 paper published in Nature points out, the fossil fuels that we\u2019re burning right now could affect future generations for up to 10,000 years. We are, in other words, \u201cimposing adverse changes on more humans than have ever existed.\u201d To quote the study, co-authored by more than 20 scientists from around the world, at length: \u201cThe next few decades offer a brief window of opportunity to minimize large-scale and potentially catastrophic climate change that will extend longer than the entire history of human civilization thus far.

Climate scientists have been  that the area of the Gulf Coast where Hurricane Harvey hit would be especially vulnerable to a major storm. A combination of a warming climate and poor city planning left Houston especially susceptible to the kind of natural disaster currently unfolding \u2014 and showed that we\u2019re not doing nearly enough when it comes to climate adaptation, or mitigation, to avoid similar disasters in the future. Hurricane Harvey is a natural disaster, but it\u2019s also a political issue, one that lays bare the risks associated with denying the threat of climate change while building increasingly vulnerable cities. As with any extreme weather event, the question is not whether climate change caused Hurricane Harvey; the question is whether climate change helped turn what would be an otherwise natural event into the kind of unprecedented disaster now unfolding. In this case, it seems clear that climate change  in two major ways: by intensifying the rainfall associated with the storm, and by creating larger and more dangerous storm surge along the coastline. To start, the waters in the Gulf of Mexico, over which Harvey formed, were five degrees higher than average. Warmer waters both intensify wind speeds associated with the storm, and allow the air to take up more water, which will then eventually fall as rain. Second, climate change fuels sea level rise, which in turn means higher and more dangerous  In some areas, Hurricane Harvey produced a storm surge of  above normally dry land. Even in a world without climate change, storms like Hurricane Harvey would form \u2014 but climate scientists are clear that human-caused warming certainly makes storms more dangerous. \u201cThe storm is a bit more intense, bigger and longer lasting than it otherwise would be,\u201d Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an email to ThinkProgress. Response to climate change is often divided into two actions: mitigation, or taking steps to reduce the amount of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere, and adaptation, or taking steps to adapt society to the consequences inherent in a changed climate. Harvey is an example of what happens when neither mitigation nor adaptation are implemented effectively. If anything, Houston \u2014 a low-lying city with clear vulnerability to intense precipitation events \u2014 has done the opposite.

Rather, this title goes to the ongoing, slow-motion catastrophe of anthropogenic climate change \u2014 a phenomenon that threatens not just the future prosperity of the U.S., but the survival of the entire global village. The fact is that climate change will result in a range of catastrophic consequences, including extreme heat waves, the spread of infectious disease, megadroughts, coastal flooding, desertification, food supply disruptions, widespread biodiversity loss (e.g., the sixth mass extinction), mass migrations, social unrest and political instability \u2014 to name just a few. And multiple high-ranking U.S. officials have affirmed a causal connection between climate change and terrorism. For example, John Brennan, the current Director of the CIA, recently stated that \u201cthe impact of climate change\u201d is one of the \u201cdeeper causes of this rising instability\u201d in countries like Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Yemen and Libya.

Similar results are reported by NASA in the US and the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. The 2011 Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature study further confirmed the patterns of temperature increase.6 If the world continues to emit GHGs along a \"business as usual\" path, concentrations of GHGs could rise to the region of 750 ppm CO2 by around the end of the century. At these levels of GHG concentrations, some climate models suggest a median temperature increase over the next one or two centuries of about 4\u00b0C or more, with substantial probabilities of well above 4\u00b0C.7 The physical and human geography of the planet would likely be transformed with temperature increases of 4\u00b0C or more: deserts, coast-lines, rivers, rainfall patterns\u2014the reasons we live where we do\u2014would be redrawn. One way of trying to grasp what might happen with global increases in temperature is to look at past periods of changes in CO2 concentrations or temperature. In the period following the industrial revolution beginning approximately 200 years ago, the intensifying use of fossil fuels has rapidly increased CO2 concentrations in the atmo-sphere. Before this, CO2 concentrations were driven according to naturally occurring processes on timescales of many thousands or even millions of years. The planet has not seen CO2 levels as high as the current 400 ppm for at least 800,000 years' and likely not for around 3 million years. Global mean temperatures regularly exceeding 4\u00b0C above preindustrial have likely not been seen for at least 10 million years, perhaps much more.\" The last time CO2 levels exceeded 750 ppm, with surface temperatures well beyond 4\u00b0C above preindustrial figures, was likely about 35 million years ago during the Eocene epoch, when the planet was entirely ice-free. Today that would drive a sea level rise of 70 meters. Modern Homo sapiens is probably no more than 250,000 years old and has not experienced anything like this. Our own civilizations, living in villages and towns, appeared after the last ice age during the Holocene period. The early Holocene, between around 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, saw rapid changes in ice sheets, sea levels, and temperature.\" Following this transition, over the last seven or eight millennia, temperatures have been remarkably stable, fluctuating in a range of plus or minus 1.5\u00b0C around an average.' These Holocene temperatures allowed our societies to develop: grasses were cultivated to become cereals, thus requiring sedentary populations to tend and protect crops until harvest, and allowing both surplus and storage. This provided time and opportunity to develop villages and towns and much of the skills of civilization, culture, and ways of life as we know them. We are already on the upper edge of that range of Holocene temperature fluctuation, in large measure as a result of changes brought about by humans. A temperature increase of 3-4\u00b0C would be well outside that range. It seems possible that we have not seen sustained temperatures around 3\u00b0C above preindustrial for around 3 million years.

This follows months of challenging weather, which often left devastation in its wake. The past several years have many asking if we are seeing long-predicted results of climate change, partially caused by man-made (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions. Superstorm Sandy devastated major urban centers in the Northeast, including New York City. The Midwest drought continues to stress food prices and barge traffic on the Mississippi River. The summer heatwave of 2012 brought temperatures in excess of 105-110 degrees Fahrenheit to an unprecedented area of the United States, including major urban centers like Chicago, St. Louis, and the I-95 urban corridor. Several recent studies and statements by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the American Meteorological Society (AMS), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that such seemingly biblical scale events are not necessarily random or attributable to weather variability alone. These groups point out that the natural weather and a backdrop of climate warming and change is now enhancing climate variability. Our climate is essentially on \u201csteroids.\u201d Scientists who study weather and climate generally agree that humans are now altering the climate though some popular media outlets, blogs and political forums may give a different impression. Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges we face today and this will not change in the years to come. In 2004, the Congressional Black Congress Foundation (CBCF) issued a report entitled, \u201cAfrican Americans and Climate Change: An Unequal Burden\u201d and more recent studies continue to sound this warning to the African American community. One can only look to Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans to get a glimpse of this reality. But why is climate change affecting African Americans disproportionately? For a few reasons: Where We Live: 2012 was possibly the warmest year in the U.S. record, according to NOAA. The majority of African Americans live in urban areas. The combination of climate warming, heatwaves, and the urban heat island effect (which causes temperatures in major cities to be warmer than suburban and rural areas) renders many Blacks at risk of suffering heat-related health issues. A 2008 study by The Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative found heat-related deaths among Blacks occur at a 150 to 200 percent greater rate than for non-Hispanic Whites. Cities also tend to have more air pollution and smog----which leads to an array of health complications like asthma (which affects Blacks at a 36 percent higher rate of incidence than Whites) and other upper respiratory issues. Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges we face today and this will not change in the years to come. Social Vulnerability: A number of studies (such as this one) show that socially vulnerable groups such as the elderly, lower income, racial minorities, and women were more likely than other income groups to perceive greater risks from natural disasters but be less likely to respond to warnings about disasters; to suffer disproportionately from the physical and psychological impacts of disasters; experience injuries or higher mortality rates; and find it more difficult to recover after disasters. Water-borne disease, post-traumatic stress, loss of jobs or hours, and infrastructure damage also have lasting effects on the African-American community. Job and Energy Disparities: Market forces responding to climate change (e.g., cap and trade policies, regulation) will drive supply, demand, and price for commodities and services that adversely affect traditionally lower-earning communities. In the South, lower income African-Americans and Hispanics are employed as wage laborers either directly or indirectly in the agricultural industry, which is particularly sensitive to weather and climate variability, especially drought. Energy policy and climate are also linked. African American households are particularly vulnerable to shifts in energy or fuel prices. The CBCF study also pointed out that African-Americans, per capita, have smaller carbon emissions than White populations, even though they are more significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change. Darryl Matthews, Executive Director at the National Medical Association notes \u201cit is clearly evident during these extreme weather events that our communities are extremely vulnerable due to the highly technological developments (power, ATMs, electronic transactions) on which we have come to depend.\u201d Dr. Cassandra Johnson, U.S. Forest Service social scientist, further suggests that \u201ccommunity groups consider actions to help mitigate changing climate like creating more green space.\u201d African-Americans are not strangers to environmental justices issues like brownfields (land with environmental problems that may leave it vacant or underused), industrial pollution, and water pollution. However, like a many people of all races, climate change is often not perceived as an immediate threat or may even be viewed as unsettled or theory. Scientists understand what is at stake; now, our community must as well. \t\t", "", "!

The report\u2019s authors warned of a \u201cgrowing risk \u2026 to human security\u201d with the potential for \u201csystemic disruption\u201d and so-called Black Swan events \u2013 major unexpected changes. They called for an international \u201cemergency response mechanism\u201d to be created to help deal with crises as they arise and an increase in emergency food stocks. Urgent action should also be taken to improve \u201cweak and ageing\u201d infrastructure in major crop-producing regions such as Russia, Ukraine and the US, the report added. Global warming is expected to produce more violent storms and increased flooding in some areas, which could damage roads, railways and ports. And, as the temperature and rainfall change, this could also affect crop yields. The report, called Chokepoints and Vulnerabilities in Global Food Trade, said international trade had enabled certain areas to specialise in certain types of food production, which had maximised productivity and reduced prices, but warned this food system was now \u201ccoming under increasing strain\u201d. \u201cWhile market forces have largely adjusted adequately until now, the capacity of international trade to correct for supply disruptions in a climate-changed world is less certain,\u201d the report said. \u201cClimate change will suppress growth in crop yields and make harvests more variable. \u201cIt will threaten the reliability and integrity of the infrastructure on which international trade depends. \u201cIn addition to more regular and more severe weather-induced damage to roads, railways, ports and inland waterways, climate change will have a multiplying effect on security and political hazards affecting the infrastructural backbone of international trade.\u201d Experts highlighted 14 chokepoints around the world \u2013 such as the Panama and Suez canals, the US rail network and its inland waterways, Brazil\u2019s roads and the Turkish Straits \u2013 that are vitally important to the continued flow of food. Just three regions, the US, Brazil and the Black Sea area, account for 53 per cent of global exports of wheat, rice, maize and soybean. The first three crops make up 60 per cent of the food we eat, while soybean is 65 per cent of animals\u2019 protein feed. The report said the chokepoints were the \u201cpotential epicentres of systemic disruption\u201d. \u201cA serious interruption at one or more of these chokepoints could conceivably lead to supply shortfalls and price spikes, with systemic consequences that could reach beyond food markets,\u201d it said. \u201cIn an increasingly unpredictable world, ensuring the resilience of populations and critical infrastructure to compound and cascading supply chain disruptions, and to \u2018black swan\u2019 events, will become increasingly vital yet ever more challenging. \u201cWithout significant investment in new approaches \u2026 food trade chokepoints will pose a material and growing risk to systemic stability and to human security, chiefly in the world\u2019s most food-insecure and politically volatile regions.\u201d The report found 10 per cent of global trade in cereals, soybeans and fertilisers passed through a maritime chokepoint for which there was \u201cno viable alternative\u201d. \u201cOver the past 15 years, all but one of the 14 critical chokepoints has been subject to closure or to restrictions on traffic,\u201d it added. The rapid melting of ice the Arctic is opening up new shipping routes between the northern Atlantic and Pacific but the authors said this was \u201cunlikely to relieve pressure on existing shipping routes before the second half of the century\u201d. One of the authors, Laura Wellesley, said the oil industry had been \u201cmapping this sort of risk for years but it has been woefully overlooked in discussions of food security\u201d. \u201cPast events, including floods in Brazil and the Southern US, and the export bans on wheat from the Black Sea countries that contributed in part to the Arab Spring, give us a flavour of the sort of disruptions that can occur when chokepoints are closed,\u201d she said. She said governments had a tendency to make decisions in their own \u201cshort-term, national interests in mind\u201d. But these could \u201cexacerbate the global problem, and undermine systemic resilience\u201d. \u201cWe need a new, collaborative approach to mapping and mitigating the growing threat we all face,\u201d Ms Wellesley said. Robin Willoughby, Oxfam head of food and climate policy and campaigns, said climate change was \"the single greatest threat to our chances of winning the fight against hunger\". And he added: \"The global food system is woefully unprepared to cope with its savage impacts. \u201cSmall-scale farmers and poor urban consumers are on the front lines of increased weather and food price volatility. \u201cThey need major new support to adapt to the changing climate \u2013 from improved irrigation schemes, crop insurance and agricultural research and development to stronger social protection. \u201cAs the Paris Agreement failed to provide these new resources, responsible leaders in rich and poor countries alike should start to plug the gap immediately.\u201d", "", "!

Above two degrees \u2013 which we have already locked in \u2013 the world\u2019s food harvest is going to become increasingly unreliable, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned this week. That means mid-century famines in places like India, China, the Middle East and Africa. But what scientists cannot predict is how humans living in the tropics and subtropics will respond to this form of stress. So let us turn to the strategic and military think tanks, who like to explore such scenarios, instead. The Age of Consequences study by the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies says that under a 2.6 degree rise \u201cnations around the world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and pernicious challenges, such as pandemic disease. The internal cohesion of nations will be under great stress\u2026as a result of a dramatic rise in migration and changes in agricultural patterns and water availability. The flooding of coastal communities around the world\u2026 has the potential to challenge regional and even national identities. Armed conflict between nations over resources\u2026 is likely and nuclear war is possible. The social consequences range from increased religious fervour to outright chaos.\u201d Of five degrees \u2013 which the world is on course for by 2100 if present carbon emissions continue \u2013 it simply says the consequences are \"inconceivable\". Eighteen nations currently have nuclear weapons technology or access to it, raising the stakes on nuclear conflict to the highest level since the end of the Cold War. At the same time, with more than 4 billion people living in the world\u2019s most vulnerable regions, scope for refugee tsunamis and pandemic disease is also large. It is on the basis of scenarios such as these that scientists like Peter Schellnhuber \u2013 science advisor to German President Angela Merkel \u2013 and Canadian author Gwynne Dyer have warned of the potential loss of most of the human population in the conflicts, famines and pandemics spinning out of climate impacts. Whether that adds up to extinction or not rather depends on how many of the world\u2019s 20,000 nukes are let off in the process. These issues all involve assumptions about human, national and religious behaviour and are thus beyond the remit of scientific bodies like the IPCC, which can only hint at what they truly think will happen.

This grim assessment begs the question, What are the projected long-term consequences for the ecological condition of the ocean if we continue with business as usual? Predicting the future is, at best, a highly uncertain enterprise. Nevertheless, I believe we have a sufficient basic understanding of the ecological processes involved to make meaningful qualitative predictions about what will happen in the oceans if humans fail to restrain their style of exploitation and consumption. Failure to stop overfishing will push increasing numbers of species to the brink of extinction\u2014perhaps irreversibly as for Newfoundland cod\u2014except for small, opportunistic species. Unrestrained runoff of nutrients and toxins, coupled with rising temperatures, will increase the size and abundance of dead zones and toxic blooms that may merge all along the continents. Even farmed seafood will be increasingly toxic and unfit for human consumption unless grown in isolation from the ocean. Outbreaks of disease will increase. Failure to cap and reduce emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases will increase ocean temperatures and intensify acidification. Warmer and lighter surface waters will inhibit vertical mixing of the ocean, eventually leading to hypoxia or anoxia below the thermocline as in the Black Sea. Biogeochemical cycles will be perturbed in uncertain ways as they have been in the past (94).

If the Stockholm Paradigm reflects a fundamentally correct explanation of the evolution of inter- specific associations, then reactive management policies for dealing with emerging diseases cannot be economically sustainable. This implies that an additional strategy that could be employed in conjunction with those reactive tactics is being proactive. We can use our knowledge of what has happened in the past to help us anticipate the future. It is a kind of evolutionary risk assessment. Just as we cannot stop climate change, we cannot stop these emerging diseases. We believe, however, that proactive risk management [36,62] is less expensive and thus more effective, than responding after the crisis. A broader macroevolutionary picture for general processes of expansion and invasion is emerging, which links historical and contemporary systems. Historical conservatism is pervasive, and it is evident that equivalent mechanisms have structured faunal assembly in the biosphere and that episodes of expansion and isolation have alternated over time. Fine- scale (landscape) processes as a mosaic within larger events, while important, are idiosyncratic and more strongly influ- enced by chance and founder events. Thus, in contemporary associations, under the influence of accelerating change, we cannot always predict which components of the biota will come into proximity or contact, the duration of these events or the temporal order in which faunal mixing occurs. In these instances, the importance of adaptation may be diminished, whereas the persistence of parasites and pathogens through broad sloppy fitness space can be seen as the capacity to use rapidly changing resources without narrow restriction to any particular ecological/environmental setting. Climate and disturbance-driven taxon pulses coupled with oscillations in host range can be expected to influence the frequency of EID, because they create episodes of geographical range shifts and expansions. The episodes, in turn, increase biotic mixing and the opportunities for EF [ecological fitting] to occur. The current EID crisis is \u2018new\u2019 only in the sense that this is the first such event that scientists have witnessed directly. Previous episodes through earth history of global climate change and ecological perturbation, broadly defined, have been associated with environmental disruptions that led to EID [16,17,62]. From an epidemiological standpoint, episodes of global climate change should be expected to be associated with the origins of new host \u2013 parasite associations and bursts of EID. The combination of taxon pulses and EF suggests that host and parasite species with the greatest ability to disperse should be the primary sources of EID [58,62 \u2013 64]. Palaeontological studies suggest that species with large geographical ranges and with high ability to disperse are most successful at surviving large-scale environmental perturbation and mass extinctions [65]. Thus, the species most successful at surviving global climate changes will be the primary sources of EID, so host extinction will not limit the risk of EID. The planet is thus an evolutionary and ecological minefield of EID through which millions of people, their crops and their livestock wander daily.", ""], "id": "5b22932a9c8d2c22f1c318dab92b6c32393f38dcec23c157e4019ffe9ac13124", "highlighted_text": "reactive management policies cannot be sustainable proactive risk management is effective Climate influence the frequency of EID , create episodes of geographical range shifts and expansions . increase biotic mixing and opportunities for [ecological fitting] to occur Previous climate change have been associated with environmental disruptions that led to EID species most successful at surviving climate changes will be the primary sources so host extinction will not limit the risk The planet is an evolutionary and ecological minefield of EID through which millions wander daily", "highlights": [[2, 274, 302], [2, 338, 347], [2, 361, 372], [2, 744, 769], [2, 778, 780], [2, 810, 819], [2, 1918, 1925], [2, 2021, 2051], [2, 2051, 2052], [2, 2066, 2125], [2, 2125, 2126], [2, 2150, 2176], [2, 2181, 2198], [2, 2202, 2231], [2, 2358, 2366], [2, 2408, 2422], [2, 2469, 2536], [2, 3115, 3151], [2, 3159, 3202], [2, 3211, 3213], [2, 3214, 3229], [2, 3230, 3253], [2, 3262, 3275], [2, 3281, 3283], [2, 3284, 3321], [2, 3322, 3351], [2, 3395, 3407]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 63], [2, 65, 70], [2, 92, 104], [2, 119, 130], [2, 274, 302], [2, 338, 347], [2, 361, 372], [2, 678, 716], [2, 718, 728], [2, 730, 737], [2, 739, 743], [2, 744, 769], [2, 778, 780], [2, 810, 819], [2, 1643, 1917], [2, 1918, 1925], [2, 1949, 2020], [2, 2021, 2051], [2, 2061, 2065], [2, 2066, 2125], [2, 2127, 2139], [2, 2150, 2176], [2, 2177, 2180], [2, 2181, 2198], [2, 2199, 2201], [2, 2202, 2231], [2, 2233, 2356], [2, 2358, 2366], [2, 2367, 2407], [2, 2408, 2422], [2, 2423, 2450], [2, 2469, 2536], [2, 2895, 2911], [2, 2912, 3098], [2, 3105, 3114], [2, 3115, 3151], [2, 3152, 3158], [2, 3159, 3202], [2, 3203, 3210], [2, 3211, 3213], [2, 3214, 3229], [2, 3230, 3253], [2, 3254, 3260], [2, 3262, 3275], [2, 3276, 3280], [2, 3281, 3283], [2, 3284, 3321], [2, 3322, 3351], [2, 3352, 3394], [2, 3395, 3407], [2, 3407, 3408]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 4], [5, 13], [14, 20], [21, 27], [27, 49], [57, 64], [64, 66]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2015-02-16"}, {"tag": "Peacekeeping", "cite": "SAM 18 [A citizen\u2019s guide to US security and defense assistance].

But as I discuss in a new report for the Council on Foreign Relations, the United States makes other multidimensional contributions to peace operations on the continent. Washington exercises influence over the strategic direction of many peace operations; it runs a variety of \u201ctrain and equip\u201d programs; and some of its personnel participate directly in these missions. I draw on the findings of the report to answer four basic questions about U.S. support for peace operations in Africa: 1. How does the United States support peace operations in Africa? The United States plays a key role in shaping the strategic direction and design of peace operations on the continent. Washington\u2019s permanent seat on the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council grants significant leverage on many issues, including shaping mission mandates and the ability to veto any proposed peace operation it does not support. Likewise, both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations have played leading roles in authorizing the expansion of peace operations in Africa. The United States also used its influence to push for institutional peacekeeping reforms at the United Nations. One major institutional reform is still ongoing: the development of operational standards for U.N. peacekeepers. The United States also supported the Senior Advisory Group process, which in 2012 called for longer troop rotations to preserve institutional memory, reductions in reimbursement to countries whose peacekeepers deploy without necessary equipment, financial premiums for countries providing critical enabling capabilities (such as engineering or aviation units), and provision of danger pay to troops in high-risk areas. 2. What financial assistance does the U.S. provide? The United States is the largest financial supporter of U.N. and African peace operations. It is responsible for 22 percent of the regular U.N. budget (which covers special political missions) and 28.4% of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. Some of these costs are recouped by U.S. businesses, which win a significant portion of contracts supporting U.N. missions. Washington also provides direct financial support to the African Union\u2019s activities as well as contributing countries involved in peace operations.

This has always been true: when bronze implements supplanted those made of stone, the ancient world got scythes and awls, but also swords and battle-axes. The novelty of our present situation is that modern technology can provide small groups of people with much greater lethality than ever before. We now have to worry that private parties might gain access to weapons that are as destructive as\u2014or possibly even more destructive than\u2014 those held by any nation-state. A handful of people, perhaps even a single individual, could have the ability to kill millions or even billions. Indeed, it is possible, from a technological standpoint, to kill every man, woman, and child on earth. The gravity of the situation is so extreme that getting the concept across without seeming silly or alarmist is challenging. Just thinking about the subject with any degree of seriousness numbs the mind. The goal of this essay is to present the case for making the needed changes before such a catastrophe occurs. The issues described here are too important to ignore. Failing nation-states\u2014like North Korea\u2014which possess nuclear weapons potentially pose a nuclear threat. Each new entrant to the nuclear club increases the possibility this will happen, but this problem is an old one, and one that existing diplomatic and military structures aim to manage. The newer and less understood danger arises from the increasing likelihood that stateless groups, bent on terrorism, will gain access to nuclear weapons, most likely by theft from a nation-state. Should this happen, the danger we now perceive to be coming from rogue states will pale in comparison. The ultimate response to a nuclear attack is a nuclear counterattack. Nation states have an address, and they know that we will retaliate in kind. Stateless groups are much more difficult to find which makes a nuclear counterattack virtually impossible. As a result, they can strike without fear of overwhelming retaliation, and thus they wield much more effective destructive power. Indeed, in many cases the fundamental equation of retaliation has become reversed. Terrorists often hope to provoke reprisal attacks on their own people, swaying popular opinion in their favor. The aftermath of 9/11 is a case in point. While it seems likely that Osama bin Laden and his henchmen hoped for a massive overreaction from the United States, it is unlikely his Taliban hosts anticipated the U.S. would go so far as to invade Afghanistan. Yes, al-Qaeda lost its host state and some personnel. The damage slowed the organization down but did not destroy it. Instead, the stateless al-Qaeda survived and adapted. The United States can claim some success against al-Qaeda in the years since 9/11, but it has hardly delivered a deathblow. Eventually, the world will recognize that stateless groups are more powerful than nation-states because terrorists can wield weapons and mount assaults that no nationstate would dare to attempt. So far, they have limited themselves to dramatic tactical terrorism: events such as 9/11, the butchering of Russian schoolchildren, decapitations broadcast over the internet, and bombings in major cities. Strategic objectives cannot be far behind.

The United States is still Saudi Arabia's most effective security support, but if Washington distances itself from regional matters, the gradual entrance of new players into the Gulf is inevitable. The question of Saudi acquisition of a nuclear deterrent is more relevant than ever when both enemies and friends of the United States are looking at a possible regional drawdown on Washington's part as well as a lack of support for the pro-Western regimes that remain in place. If the U.S. government provides Riyadh with formal security guarantees, it would be natural for it to demand that the kingdom forego its strategic goals. But Riyadh's inclusion under a U.S. defense umbrella is not a given and depends both on the quality of relations between the two countries and other Saudi considerations. Riyadh remains skeptical over Washington's willingness to come to its aid and may thus seek to purchase a nuclear deterrent, which would provide it with more freedom vis-\u00e0-vis its stronger ally. Under present circumstances, it is not unreasonable for Riyadh to rely on other states for its defense in addition to Washington for the simple reason that it has done so in the past. Likewise, it is more than likely that the Saudis will not act transparently because they have acted in secret previously. After Iran, Saudi Arabia is the number one candidate for further nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. Open source evidence remains circumstantial, but perhaps more than any other regional player, Riyadh has the requisite ideological and strategic motives as well as the financial wherewithal to act on the option. The kingdom may conclude that its security constraints as well as the attendant prestige and influence generated by having a bomb outweigh the political and economic costs it will pay. The difficulty in stopping Tehran's dogged quest for a nuclear capability coupled with Riyadh's doubts about the reliability of Washington is liable to encourage Riyadh to shorten timetables for developing an independent nuclear infrastructure, as well as to opt to purchase a turnkey nuclear system, an off-the-shelf product, or to enter into a security compact of one sort with another power. Sunni-majority Pakistan has emerged as the natural candidate for such an arrangement. Heavy U.S. pressure is likely to be brought to bear on the Saudis not to acquire nuclear capabilities. Indeed, it seems that, at present, the price Riyadh is likely to pay should it acquire military nuclear capabilities might outweigh the advantages of such a move. But strategic interest, motivated by considerations of survival, could have the upper hand.

The last thing the United States needs in the Middle East is an offensive missile race, which could quickly lead the antagonists into a deadly military confrontation that drags Washington and Moscow into war. Missiles are inherently destabilizing weapons because of their potential to quickly escalate conflicts. Their flight times can be very short, and new technologies are dramatically improving their accuracy and lethality. As if that were not scary enough, the nuclear future of the Middle East is also increasingly uncertain, now that the United States has withdrawn from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal that limited Iran\u2019s nuclear development in exchange for sanctions relief. At the same time, at least half a dozen regional powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and Qatar see peaceful nuclear energy as a long-term solution to their fossil-fuel dependence. The growth of nuclear power generation in the region could exacerbate the risk of nuclear proliferation, as the same technologies and materials are required to develop both nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Should Middle East civilian nuclear development become militarized, possession of fleets of offensive missiles\u2014arguably the most effective delivery vehicle for nuclear warheads\u2014could magnify the potential danger. [THEIR CARD ENDS HERE] Like Israel, some Gulf countries are heading toward a stronger deterrent posture\u2014through a broader mix of offensive technologies, including missiles\u2014because missile defense on its own does not seem to be the answer to the Iranian missile problem. Furthermore, missile defense is expensive and comes with its own set of challenges. While the best missile defense system would be one that is regionally integrated, any hope of establishing such a system in the Gulf is now gone because of the ongoing feud Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, and Bahrain are having with Qatar. With US influence in the Gulf seemingly declining, it is unlikely that Washington\u2019s preferences will register as strongly in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi as they did in the past. To be sure, the drive for autonomy in national-security decision making has its limits, given the Gulf countries\u2019 military dependence on Wa\tshington, but US weapons are not the only game in town, with both Russia and China making inroads into the region lately. Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may not be able to buy offensive missiles from the United States and other countries that are members of the Missile Technology Control Regime, but they will find China and Pakistan\u2014who are not part of the regime\u2014to be ready sellers. Saudi Arabia would not have to start from scratch, given that since 1987 it has possessed a (likely small) number of medium-range Chinese ballistic missiles. It paraded them for the first time in 2014, possibly to put Iran on notice and send a message to Washington of displeasure with US policy. It is only a matter of time before Saudi Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammed Bin Salman issues an order to build up the country\u2019s Strategic Rocket Force. America has long wished that its partners in the Middle East would step up and share the burden of regional security. But for this approach to end well, one crucial variable is required: American leadership, which currently is uncertain at best and nonexistent at worst. The Middle East is headed into an offensive missile race, and the only actor that can stop or at least manage the situation, by promoting arms control, is the United States.

From 1919 to 1940, all were independent nations, but in 1940 all were subsumed into the Soviet Union. The Nazis conquered them, but the Soviets took them back and reintegrated them into the USSR. During the process, the Baltic peoples fought a vast and prolonged anti-Communist guerrilla warthat lasted into the mid-1950s, a heroic struggle that remains all but unknown in the West: \"Proportionally, the partisan movement in the post-war Baltic states was of a similar size as the Viet Cong movement in South Vietnam.\" Tens of thousands perished. The Soviets then regained their power, and the Baltic Republics shared the ups and downs of the post-Stalin USSR, During that time, the republics were (by Soviet standards) relatively prosperous and Westernized, and they never lost their national identity. In 1991, all three resumed their independence. Crucially for the present argument, they entered wholesale into Western and European identities. All joined NATO, which means that NATO allies have an obligation to defend them if they are attacked or invaded. They joined the European Union, and accepted the Euro currency, aligning them with the core nations moving towards full European union. To that extent, they are as European as Italy or the Netherlands. It might be useful here to give a sense of the scale of territory we are talking about. If you look at a map of the Baltic sea, you will see the three nations I have mentioned, and also to their west, a small patch of land (to which I shall return shortly), which is the small detached Russian territory of Kaliningrad. Taking the four lands together makes up about 74,000 square miles, roughly the size of Nebraska. About 6.5 million people inhabit these lands. Assume that Vladimir Putin or a likely successor decides to appropriate some or all of the Baltic states, applying the same methods that worked so swimmingly in Ukraine. The potential for such action is extremely encouraging, especially in terms of Russian minorities who can be represented as victims in urgent need of protection. During the Soviet years, many ethnic Russians took up residence in the Baltic lands, and their descendants remain - around one million in all. All three nations thus have sizable Russian minorities: Latvia 26%, Estonia 25% and Lithuania 6%. Some of these populations are heavily concentrated in particular regions close to a Russian frontier, as in the far north east of Estonia, and the eastern portions of Latvia, around the nation's second city of Daugavpils. If I were Vladimir Putin, I would be viewing these regions greedily as the core of a future secessionist and pro-Russian land, whose inhabitants were clamouring for reunion with Mother Russia. The sizable Russian population around the capital of Riga itself poses a special difficulty for Latvia, which would be the obvious target for a Ukraine-style assault. Presumably, we would see the same 2014-style script, of ethnic Russian movements and groups, supported by Little Green Men. We can also more or less write the propaganda surrounding the campaign, which would likely focus on charges of Nazi sympathies among the leadership of the Baltic states. Given the extraordinary technological orientation of nations like Estonia, the Russians might be harder pressed to launch successful cyber-warfare, but they would certainly attempt it. In the non-electronic world, Estonians and other Baltic peoples have formed militias and private armies ready to resist a Soviet occupation, as they did back in the 1940s. What about that mysterious bit of ground called Kaliningrad? It was formerly known as Koenigsberg, best known as the home of Immanuel Kant. When the Baltics seceded in 1991, this area became an oblast, a physical territory belonging to Russia, although separated physically from the nearest Russian soil by some four hundred miles. It thus presently stands between Poland and Lithuania. It matters so enormously because it is the centre of Russia's still potent Baltic Fleet, which has major ice-free ports at Kaliningrad itself, and at Baltiysk. In the event of a secession crisis in the Baltic republics, Russia has excellent means to intervene directly should it so choose, and (more likely) to deny the area to assistance from Western forces. An awful lot has been written in late years of Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD), and the Russians are very good at it. A Russian move against the Baltic republics would pay multiple dividends. Most essentially, it would reassert Putin's most heartfelt goal of restoring the Soviet Union, with himself as unquestioned master, the heir to Stalin. But it would also provide a critical strategic test for the two institutions that most conspicuously stand in the way of Russian expansion, namely NATO and the European Union. If the West failed to respond to such a direct attack on a member of both circles, it would effectively leave Europe detached from the United States, and largely dependent on Russian good will. Always recall the old semi-joke about NATO's chief functions: it is there to keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down. The Baltic gambit would defeat two of those goals at a stroke. No less significant, such a move would pose very limited risks for the Russians. If the Baltic secessionists won, it would be wonderful news for the Kremlin. If they lost and were suppressed, well, we Russians had nothing to do with them, and they were a purely internal Latvian or Estonian matter. We deny everything. Low risk, high potential gain. Why not try it? It's a question of when rather than if. The only slight caveat here is that the Ukraine outcome has been somewhat more time-consuming and difficult than Putin first imagined, which might encourage a degree of caution in the Baltic. Where a Baltic move would be irresistible would be if the United States and NATO were totally focused on some other global confrontation - say, with North Korea or Iran. In that case, the world's media would have little attention to spare on the Baltics. For the sake of argument, imagine that a Ukraine-style crisis developed in Latvia, with intensive use of hybrid warfare. What would NATO do? What would Europe do? This situation would be radically different from Ukraine because now we are dealing with a nation bound to Western nations by close formal ties of treaty and law. Ukraine was not. Baltic leaders have said repeatedly that they would regard the appearance of Little Green Men on their territory as demanding the invocation of the NATO Treaty's Article 5, so that other nations (including the United States) would be required to come to their defence. At the same time, one could argue that this was not a genuine Article 5 situation, because Latvia was not facing an actual Russian invasion, but rather an entirely spontaneous and autonomous upsurge by disaffected citizens and minority groups. And who really knows who those Little Green Men might really be? (They are of course Russian soldiers and special forces, but let's say that very quietly, or we might end up having to go to war.) Adding to the pressure on Western nations would be the unspoken Russian nuclear threat. In recent exercises, Russian forces have made dummy nuclear runs against Warsaw and Stockholm, while threatening nuclear attacks on Copenhagen. Last year, the Russians moved nuclear-capable Iskander missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave, within easy reach of multiple EU capitals. Ultimately, then, any decision to resist an effective Russian re-annexation of Latvia - and then the other two republics - would be a matter for policymakers and political leaders within the United States, the only nation with the possible ability to face down the Russians.

Any sensible discussion of what a hypothetical World War III might look like needs to begin with the sheer size and force of America\u2019s military assets. For all that China and Russia are arming up on various measures, US commanders have the power to dominate escalating crises and counter opposing forces before they can be used. Take missile warfare alone. The US Navy already has 4,000 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and the Navy and Air Force are currently taking delivery of 5,000 JASSM conventional cruise missiles with ranges from 200-600 miles. Barely visible to radar, these are designed to destroy \u201chardened\u201d targets such as nuclear missile silos. Russia and China, by contrast, have nothing of equivalent quantity or quality with which to threaten the US mainland. The same holds true when it comes to maritime forces. While much is made of Russia\u2019s two frigates and smaller vessels stationed off the Syrian coast, France alone has 20 warships and an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean \u2013 and US standing forces in the area include six destroyers equipped with scores of cruise missiles and anti-missile systems.

Meanwhile, China\u2019s aggressively expansionist behaviour in the South China Sea is reported alongside stories of its first aircraft carrier and long-range ballistic missiles. But for all that the Chinese navy is large and growing, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, it\u2019s still only numerically equivalent to the combined fleets of Japan and Taiwan, while the US boasts 19 aircraft carriers worldwide if its marine assault ships are included. But overhanging all this, of course, is the nuclear factor. Out of the sky The US, Russia and China are all nuclear-armed; Vladimir Putin recently unveiled a new fleet of nuclear-capable missiles which he described as \u201cinvincible in the face of all existing and future systems\u201d, and some have suggested that China may be moving away from its no-first-use policy. This is all undeniably disturbing. While it has long been assumed that the threat of nuclear weapons acts as a deterrent to any war between the major powers, it\u2019s also possible that the world may simply have been riding its luck. But once again, the US\u2019s non-nuclear capabilities are all too often overlooked. US leaders may in fact believe they can remove Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent with an overwhelming conventional attack backed up by missile defences. This ability was cultivated under the Prompt Global Strike programme, which was initiated before 9/11 and continued during the Obama years. Organised through the US Air Force\u2019s Global Strike Command, it is to use conventional weapons to attack anywhere on Earth in under 60 minutes. This is not to say the task would be small. In order to destroy Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles before they can be launched, the US military would need to first blind Russian radar and command and communications to incoming attack, probably using both physical and cyber attacks. It would then have to destroy some 200 fixed and 200 mobile missiles on land, a dozen Russian missile submarines, and Russian bombers. It would then need to shoot down any missiles that could still be fired. Russia is not well positioned to survive such an attack. Its early warning radars, both satellite and land-based, are decaying and will be hard to replace. At the same time, the US has and is developing a range of technologies to carry out anti-satellite and radar missions, and it has been using them for years. (All the way back in 1985, it shot down a satellite with an F15 jet fighter.) That said, the West is very dependent on satellites too, and Russia and China continue to develop their own anti-satellite systems. The air war Russia\u2019s bomber aircraft date back to the Soviet era, so despite the alarm they provoke when they nudge at Western countries\u2019 airspace, they pose no major threat in themselves. Were the Russian and US planes to face each other, the Russians would find themselves under attack from planes they couldn\u2019t see and that are any way out of their range. US and British submarine crews claim a perfect record in constantly shadowing Soviet submarines as they left their bases throughout the Cold War. Since then, Russian forces have declined and US anti-submarine warfare has been revived, raising the prospect that Russian submarines could be taken out before they could even launch their missiles. The core of the Russia\u2019s nuclear forces consists of land-based missiles, some fixed in silos, others mobile on rail and road. The silo-based missiles can now be targeted by several types of missiles, carried by US planes almost invisible to radar; all are designed to destroy targets protected by deep concrete and steel bunkers. But a problem for US war planners is that it might take hours too long for their missile-carrying planes to reach these targets \u2013 hence the need to act in minutes. One apparently simple solution to attacking targets very quickly is to fit quick nuclear ballistic missiles with non-nuclear warheads. In 2010, Robert Gates, then serving as secretary of defence under Barack Obama, said that the US had this capability. Intercontinental ballistic missiles take just 30 minutes to fly between the continental US\u2019s Midwest and Siberia; if launched from well-positioned submarines, the Navy\u2019s Tridents can be even quicker, with a launch-to-target time of under ten minutes. From 2001, the US Navy prepared to fit its Trident missiles with either inert solid warheads \u2013 accurate to within ten metres \u2013 or vast splinter/shrapnel weapons. Critics have argued that this would leave a potential enemy unable to tell whether they were under nuclear or conventional attack, meaning they would have to assume the worst. According to US Congressional researchers, the development work came close to completion, but apparently ceased in 2013. Nonetheless, the US has continued to develop other technologies across its armed services to attack targets around the world in under an hour \u2013 foremost among them hypersonic missiles, which could return to Earth at up to ten times the speed of sound, with China and Russia trying to keep up. Missile envy The remainder of Russia\u2019s nuclear force consists of missiles transported by rail. An article on Kremlin-sponsored news outlet Sputnik described how these missile rail cars would be so hard to find that Prompt Global Strike might not be as effective as the US would like \u2013 but taken at face value, the article implies that the rest of the Russian nuclear arsenal is in fact relatively vulnerable. Starting with the \u201cScud hunt\u201d of the First Gulf War, the US military has spent years improving its proficiency at targeting mobile ground-based missiles. Those skills now use remote sensors to attack small ground targets at short notice in the myriad counter-insurgency operations it\u2019s pursued since 2001. If the \u201csword\u201d of Prompt Global Strike doesn\u2019t stop the launch of all Russian missiles, then the US could use the \u201cshield\u201d of its own missile defences. These it deployed after it walked out of a treaty with Russiabanning such weapons in 2002. While some of these post-2002 missile defence systems have been called ineffective, the US Navy has a more effective system called Aegis, which one former head of the Pentagon\u2019s missile defence programs claims can shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles. Some 300 Aegis anti-ballistic missiles now equip 40 US warships; in 2008, one destroyed a satellite as it fell out of orbit. War mentality In advance of the Iraq war, various governments and onlookers cautioned the US and UK about the potential for unforeseen consequences, but the two governments were driven by a mindset impervious to criticism and misgivings. And despite all the lessons that can be learned from the Iraq disaster, there\u2019s an ample risk today that a similarly gung-ho attitude could take hold. Foreign casualties generally have little impact on domestic US politics. The hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who died under first sanctions and then war did not negatively impact presidents Clinton or George W. Bush. Neither might the prospect of similar casualties in Iran or North Korea or other states, especially if \u201chumanitarian\u201d precision weapons are used. But more than that, an opinion poll run by Stanford University\u2019s Scott Sagan found that the US public would not oppose the preemptive use of even nuclear weapons provided that the US itself was not affected. And nuclear Trident offers that temptation. The control of major conventional weapons as well as WMD needs urgent attention from international civil society, media and political parties. There is still time to galvanise behind the Nobel-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and the nuclear ban treaty, and to revive and globalise the decaying arms control agenda of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which played a vital part in bringing the Cold War to a largely peaceful end. Like the Kaiser in 1914, perhaps Trump or one of his successors will express dismay when faced with the reality a major US offensive unleashes. But unlike the Kaiser, who saw his empire first defeated and then dismembered, perhaps a 21st-century US president might get away with it."], "id": "2b89723d36ceb7feee7dd0ade46f36e0db4c94a13c85f0541681949d098ee6ae", "highlighted_text": "US commanders have the power to dominate escalating crises and counter opposing forces before they can be used.

This has been driven by Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambition to restore Russia\u2019s hard power and supported by the revenues that flowed into the Kremlin\u2019s coffers between 2004 and 2014, when the price of oil was high. The modernization programs encompass all parts of the Russian military, including strategic nuclear, nonstrategic nuclear and conventional forces. The United States has to pay attention. Russia may be a power in long-term decline, but it retains the capacity to make significant trouble. Moreover, in recent years the Kremlin has shown a new readiness to use military force. But not all aspects of the modernization program are equally worrisome. STRATEGIC NUCLEAR Russia is modernizing the three legs of its strategic triad. It is procuring eight Borei-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), and is halfway through a ten-year program to build four hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). It is also updating its Tu-160 Blackjack bombers, and officials have reportedly considered reopening the Blackjack production line. Placed in context, however, the strategic modernization program appears less worrisome. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian economy went into free fall for most of the ensuing decade. The defense budget received little in comparison to Soviet times, and most programs, including strategic nuclear forces, were starved for funds. That only began to change in the mid-2000s. The strategic modernization program is replacing a lot of old systems, systems that the Russian military would have preferred to retire earlier had it been able to pay to do so. For example, a large number of Russia\u2019s strategic warheads sit atop SS-18, SS-19 and SS-25 ICBMs, all of which are scheduled to be retired by 2020. If the military had had the resources, it would have retired and replaced the SS-18s and SS-19s years ago. Four hundred ICBMs and SLBMs constitute a major program, but the number seems appropriate for a Russian strategic force that, under the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), looks like it will deploy 400\u2013450 strategic missiles. The Borei-class submarines will replace Delta-class submarines, all of which were built prior to 1991. A combination of reliability and resource concerns has meant that most of the older boats performed deterrence patrols at dockside rather than at sea. That may change as more Boreis become operational. In comparison, the U.S. Navy normally maintains about half of its fourteen Ohio-class SSBNS at sea. The fact that Moscow is considering reopening the production line for its aging Blackjack bomber is interesting. Russia currently flies only a dozen of these aircraft (in addition to some sixty older Bear bombers). A decision to resume production of Blackjacks would indicate problems and delays with the next generation PAK-DA bomber, which was originally scheduled to have its first flight by the end of this decade. NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR Moscow\u2019s nonstrategic nuclear weapons are more worrisome. To begin with, there is Russia\u2019s violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile to intermediate range. While such a missile likely will not pose a direct threat to the United States, it constitutes a treaty violation and would threaten U.S. allies, as well as other countries, in Europe and Asia. The outside world has less visibility regarding Russia\u2019s nonstrategic arsenal than Russia\u2019s strategic forces. It appears, however, that the military has developed a range of nonstrategic nuclear capabilities, including cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and aircraft. By contrast, the United States has steadily reduced the number and types of weapons in its nonstrategic nuclear arsenal, which now consists solely of the B61 nuclear bomb. Of particular concern is Russia\u2019s apparent focus on low-yield nuclear weapons\u2014which one official has referred to as a \u201cnuclear scalpel\u201d\u2014coupled with its nuclear \u201cde-escalation\u201d doctrine. That doctrine envisages escalating to de-escalate, that is, using low-yield nuclear weapons as a means to terminate a conventional conflict on terms favorable to the Kremlin. Russia\u2019s unclassified national security strategy says that nuclear weapons would be used only in the event of an attack with weapons of mass destruction on Russia or one of its allies, or in the event of an attack on Russia with conventional forces in which the fate of the state is at stake. The \u201cde-escalation\u201d doctrine, Putin\u2019s references to nuclear weapons in his public statements and the broad modernization of Russia\u2019s nonstrategic nuclear forces suggest that the classified strategy could envisage use of those weapons in wider circumstances. That risks lowering the nuclear threshold. And once a nuclear weapon\u2014any nuclear weapon\u2014is used, the possibility of catastrophic escalation would increase dramatically.", ""], "id": "f095a5ada45f3f9c60b0fa2590dd645ee1870d98fba04e515fc2507759dea957", "highlighted_text": "Russia is in the midst of a major modernization of its armed forces.

Heavily mechanized and salted with combat veterans, the U.S. Army and Russian Ground Forces have spent the better part of the last fifteen years not only chasing guerrillas from Afghanistan to Syria, but also fighting conventional-style wars in Iraq and Georgia. Now, as tensions between the NATO and Russia place U.S. and Russian ground pounders in the same country (Syria) or just across the border from one another (the Baltics), the question is: in a head to head matchup, which side would prevail? The backbone of U.S. Army infantry is the infantry squad. In light infantry\u2014including air assault, airborne and mountain units\u2014a squad consists of nine soldiers that further divide into a squad leader and two fire teams. Each fire team of four soldiers consists of a fire team leader, rifleman, grenadier, and an automatic rifleman equipped with two M4 carbines, an M4 carbine equipped with the  and the M249 squad automatic weapon. Individual soldiers will carry single-shot  as issued. In mechanized infantry units, the nine-man squad consists of the two- or three-man  or crew, plus six soldiers that dismount to fight on foot. A mechanized infantry squad can put fewer soldiers on the ground, but it also has the benefit of vastly increased mobility and firepower in the form of the Bradley\u2019s 25mm M242 Bushmaster autocannon, TOW antitank missiles, and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. Strykers are currently armed with M2 .50 caliber machine guns but Europe-based units are receiving a new turret upgrade that includes a 30mm cannon or . The mechanized dismount team also has its own M4 carbines, a M320 grenade launcher, one M249 squad automatic weapon and a Javelin shoulder-fired medium range antitank missile, capable of defeating the heaviest Russian armor at ranges of up to 2,187 yards. Mechanized infantry platoons consist of three mechanized squads without additional firepower, although a Stryker platoon will have a weapons squad with two M240B machine guns. Each platoon has four M2s or four Strykers. Light infantry platoons consist of three infantry squads and add additional firepower via a weapons squad. The weapons squad is made up by a squad leader and nine soldiers armed with two M240B machine guns and two Javelin antitank missiles, and allows the platoon commander, typically a lieutenant, to parcel out this firepower to the squads that will likely need it the most. A new addition to the weapons squad is the 84mm , versatile antipersonnel, antifortification, and antiarmor weapons system first introduced in 1946. The result: an infantry platoon with two antipersonnel and two antiarmor weapons, and a fifth weapon that can function as both. The Russian fields motor rifle (mechanized) squads and light infantry equivalent squads in the airborne forces. A typical Russian motor rifle squad will consist of a  infantry fighting vehicle or  wheeled armored personnel carrier, a three man crew, and a seven man dismount team armed with AK-74M assault rifles, two PKM machine guns and a . The GP-30 grenade launcher, the Russian equivalent of the M320, is fitted to some AK-74Ms. The PKP \u201cPecheneg\u201d will eventually replace the PKM but for now the Russian army has plenty of the older weapons. The Russian motor rifle squad is nearly identical to the U.S. Army mechanized infantry squad except it does not have a medium range antitank guided missile launcher in the same category as the Javelin. Just like in American squads, single shot, disposable RPG-18 light antitank weapons are issued as needed. Russian airborne infantry squads are similar to motor rifle squads, built around a ,,  airborne armored vehicles. Airborne squads are smaller owing to the smaller personnel carrying capacity of BMD and BTR-D vehicles. Despite having fewer troops, Russian airborne forces are much more mobile than their American counterparts. The BMD-3, which has a 30mm autocannon and BMD-4, which has a 30mm autocannon and 100mm cannon, are both armed with the . At the platoon level, Russian motor rifle forces add no additional firepower except for a single designated marksman armed with a , nor does it add additional vehicles. A motor rifle or airborne platoon of three squads consists of three vehicles plus dismounts. Russian infantry have some advantages over their American counterparts. Three vehicle platoons means the Russian Ground Forces, man for man and vehicle for vehicle, can field twenty five percent more platoons than the U.S. Army. Theoretically this gives a commander more tactical options on the battlefield. Russian airborne forces, owing to their mechanization, have much greater tactical mobility than foot-mobile American paratroopers. Moscow\u2019s parachutists can also airdrop farther from their objectives, making their way to them in their vehicles, helping keep vulnerable air transports loaded with soldiers at a distance from lethal enemy air defenses. Still, U.S. Army infantry have a decisive edge over their Russian counterparts. One reason is organizational resiliency: if a Russian platoon loses a vehicle, it loses one third of its combat power. If an American platoon loses a vehicle, it only loses a quarter of its firepower. A Russian platoon that loses two vehicles is reduced to a single vehicle. U.S. mechanized vehicles are also superior to their Russian counterparts. While both the Bradley and the BMP can carry seven soldiers, mount a 25 to 30mm autocannon and are armed with antitank missiles, the Bradley is better armored, has a digital battle management system, and carries twice as many antitank missiles ready to fire. The BMP is inferior in all respects. The American Stryker and Russian BTR-82A wheeled armored vehicles, on the other hand are roughly the same. Both are set to receive updates, the Stryker with a 30mm autocannon or Javelin turret and the BTR-82A a turret with a 57mm gun. Dismounted firepower is where U.S. forces truly shine. Against armored threats, an American platoon can bring three Javelin missiles, a M3 recoilless rifle, and numerous AT4 short-range antitank rockets to bear against enemy armor, engaging enemies at ranges of up to 2,000 yards. Their Russian comrades-in-arms could bring only unguided RPG-16 and RPG-18 rockets against enemies at a maximum effective range of about 300 yards. Against infantry, American forces bring six light and two medium machine guns and a M3 recoilless rifle to bear, versus three medium machine guns and a SVD designated marksman rifle for the Russians. American and Russian infantry would never fight alone. Both would fight as part of an integrated team with armor, mortars, heavy artillery, air support, and electronic warfare all contributing to win the battle.

The sphere the President of Russia is referring to is artificial intelligence (AI) and his comments should give you a moment of pause. Addressing students at the beginning of our Labor Day weekend, Putin remarked \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,\u201d adding, \u201cIt comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict.\u201d For once, I find myself in agreement with the President of Russia, but just this once. Artificial Intelligence offers incredible promise and peril. Nowhere is this clearer than in the realm of national security. Today un-crewed systems are a fact of modern warfare. Nearly every country is adopting systems where personnel are far removed from the conflict and wage war by remote control. AI  to sever that ground connection. Imagine a fully autonomous Predator or Reaper drone. Managed by an AI system, the drone could identify targets, determine their legitimacy, and conduct a strike all without human intervention. Indeed, the Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom issued a press  in September that the country \u201cdoes not possess fully autonomous weapon systems and has no intention of developing them,\u201d and that its weapons systems \u201cwill always be under control as an absolute guarantee of human oversight and authority and accountability.\u201d Let\u2019s think smaller. Imagine a tiny insect-sized drone loaded with explosive. Guided by a , it could hunt down a specific target \u2014 a politician, a general, or an opposition figure \u2014 determine when to strike, how to strike, and if to strike based on its own learning. Howard Hughes Medical Center  attached a backpack to a genetically modified dragonfly and flew it remotely. These examples are, however, where humans are involved and largely control the left and right limits of AI. Yet, there are examples of AI purposely and independently going beyond programed parameters. Rogue algorithms led to a  of the British Pound. In 2016, in-game AIs created super AIs weapons and  human players, and AIs have  their own languages that were indecipherable to humans. AIs proved more effective than their human counterparts in producing and catching users in spear phishing programs. Not only did the AIs create more content, they successfully  more users with their deception. While seemingly simple and low stakes in nature, extrapolate these scenarios into more significant and risky areas and the consequences become much greater. Cybersecurity is no different. Today we are focused on the hackers, trolls, and cyber criminals (officially sanctioned and otherwise) who seek to penetrate our networks, steal our intellectual property, and leave behind malicious code for activation in the event of a conflict. Replace the individual with an AI and imagine how fast hacking takes place; networks against networks, at machine speed all without a human in the loop. Sound far-fetched? It\u2019s not. In 2016, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency held an AI on AI capture the flag contest called the  at the DEF CON event. AI networks against AI networks. In August of this year the founders of 116 AI and robotics companies signed a letter petitioning the United Nations  lethal autonomous systems. Signatories to this letter included Google DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and Elon Musk who, in response to Putin\u2019s quote , \u201cCompetition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo (sic)\u201d. AI is not some far off future challenge. It is a challenge today and one with which we must grapple. I am in favor of fielding any system that enhances our national security, but we must have an open and honest conversation about the implications of AI, the consequences of which we do not, and may not, fully understand. This is not a new type of bullet or missile. This is a potentially fully autonomous system that even with human oversight and guidance will make its own decisions on the battlefield and in cyberspace. How can we ensure that the system does not escape our control? How can we prevent such systems from falling into the hands of terrorists or insurgents? Who controls the source code? How and can we build in so-called impenetrable kill switches? AI and AI-like systems are slowly being introduced into our arsenal. Our adversaries, China, Russia, and others are also introducing AI systems into their arsenals as well. Implementation is happening faster than our ability to fully comprehend the consequences. Putin\u2019s new call spells out a new arms race. Rushing to AI weapon systems without guiding principles is a dangerous. It risks an escalation that we do not fully understand and may not be able to control. The cost of limiting AI intelligence being weaponized  all of our nuclear proliferation efforts to date.

Within the continuum of blurred lines between war and peace is a new form of non-linear, or hybrid, warfare, in which all elements of the state are continually engaged, with greater or lesser emphasis.7 A recent NATO report unpacked this doctrine and the implications for Russia\u2019s new approach to warfare, and in particular hybrid warfare, noting: Such a war, they argue, goes way beyond the frames of the traditional understanding of these wars. They include political intrigues, fights over resources and financial flows, and irreconcilable civilizational conflicts. On the battlefield in these wars, regular forces act alongside a number of new actors\u2014irregular forces of rebels and fighters, criminal gangs, international terrorist networks, private military companies, and legions of foreign mercenaries, units of spetsnaz and intelligence formations from different countries, military contingents of peacekeepers from international organizations, and even non-governmental and humanitarian organizations and structures, representatives from printed and electronic mass media, volunteers, and activists from civil society.8 Viewed through the prism of this doctrine, Russia\u2019s activities in Latin America come into clearer focus. While the U.S. position remains preeminent\u2014due to geographic proximity, cultural ties, and trade ties\u2014Russia has advanced further and faster as a competitive adversary than is often understood. A review of Russia\u2019s activities in the region shows that, despite limited resources, the Gerasimov Doctrine is being implemented through a policy that incorporates multiple elements of soft power, coupled with military training and hardware, to directly displace U.S. influence. This includes counternarcotics and disaster relief, as well as engagement in regional Latin American forums created by the Bolivarian Alliance for the express purpose of excluding the United States and Canada. Diverse Forms of Engagement Russia\u2019s desire to establish a stronger foothold in Latin America is evidenced by the constant high-level government visits with its Latin American allies. In addition to more recent visits by senior officials\u2014including to Ecuador and Suriname\u2014an analysis of visits by senior Russians to Latin American countries from 2015 to 2017, (including a vist from president Putin in November 2016 to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru), demonstrates a far greater level of engagement between high-level (the equivalent of an assistant secretary or above) officials of Latin American and Russian governments than that of the United States.9 As demonstrated in news articles and official government statements, Latin American officials from an estimated 20 countries visited Russia 44 times during those three years.10 Additionally, high-ranking Russian officials visited six Latin American countries on 11 occasions. This high-level presence decreased after 2017, with president Putin only visiting Latin America once in 2018, and even then only because the G20 summit was held in Argentina.11 Admittedly, U.S. engagement with the region extends far beyond high-level or state visits, so this record does not suggest that Russian influence now exceeds that of the United States, but it does provide a useful point of reference. Equally important, experts widely agree that Russia\u2019s domestic political and economic troubles will likely prevent it from fully displacing the preeminent position that U.S. economic, security, and aid partnerships currently hold in the region. Nevertheless, these visits indicate that Russia is actively seeking partners in Latin America and is finding many countries in the region that are willing to consider such overtures. Although still dwarfed by weapons sales from the United States and elsewhere, Russia has made significant inroads in recent years throughout Latin America, primarily with friendly countries, to expand its arms sales in the region. A recent NATO report noted the significant military purchases of Russian equipment by the Maduro regime, as well as President Ortega in Nicaragua: Since 2005, Venezuela has purchased $11 billion worth of equipment from Russia, including fighter jets, helicopters and rifles. Moscow provided loans to Caracas to help purchase the S-300VM anti-ballistic missile system to protect Venezuelan waters in 2013. The recent acquisition made Venezuela the second biggest importer of Russian arms between 2012 and 2015, after India. Lately, Russia also sent warships to the Caribbean to perform drug patrols. Colombians were outraged in October 2013, when two Russian supersonic bombers, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, flew from Venezuela to Nicaragua over San Andres, disputed territory between Colombia and Nicaragua. In March 2015, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered the major military exercise \u201cBolivarian shield,\u201d with Russian participation, as a response to U.S. sanctions against seven Venezuelan officials.12 The Russian news agency TASS recently reported that since 2000, the Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport has sold $10 billion in weaponry and military equipment to Latin American nations.13 The company is working with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru to broker deals for both ground and air equipment, in particular Ural trucks and motor vehicles. In addition to Rosoboronexport, the Russian companies Rostec and Irkut Aircraft Corporation are also known to be operating in the region, including attending military expositions in Latin America. Although producing few tangible results, Russia has also publicly expressed its willingness to partner on nuclear projects in Latin America. In October 2016, Russia and Paraguay announced a new Pacific nuclear energy partnership, which begins a new wave of investments and technology sharing between the two countries.14 Similarly, in January 2018 Argentina announced a recent memorandum of understanding with Russia\u2019s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which covered uranium exploration in Argentina as well as assistance in the construction of nuclear power plants.15 Russia has also made a concerted effort to deepen its partnerships with Bolivia, recently announcing that it would assist Bolivia in building a \u201cnuclear center to research radiation technologies applied in agriculture, medicine and various industries.\u201d16 After announcing that he had met with a number of Russian officials, and was considering additional partnerships in a number of other areas\u2014including lithium production\u2014Bolivian President Evo Morales, who recently visited Russia, commented warmly on the growing Russian presence in the region.17 Organized Crime and Money Laundering Structures In his discussion of Russian foreign policy in June 2018, Admiral Tidd noted that the arrival of a Russian diplomatic presence anywhere in the world is almost immediately followed by the presence of Russian organized crime, which often allies itself with existing transnational criminal networks.18 These criminal activities are often sanctioned by the Russian government and are considered among the tools of statecraft under the Gerasimov Doctrine. There have been several cases in Latin America recently where the Russian state and transnational criminal networks have merged to the mutual benefit and profit of both. Perhaps the most notorious case of such collaboration came to light in February 2018, when Argentine authorities seized approximately 400 kilograms of cocaine destined for Russia, which they discovered housed in an annex of the Russian embassy. Former Russian diplomatic officials, as well as Argentine police, were among those arrested as part of the operation, which aimed to move the cocaine in diplomatic luggage to Moscow.19 The head of the criminal network identified as \u201cMr. K,\u201d Andrey Kovalchuck, was reported to have a relationship with the Russian ambassador in Argentina.20 He was arrested in Germany in March 2018.21 Testimony from one of the men arrested in the case, Ali Abyanov, indicated that the Russian embassy in Uruguay was heavily involved in the drug smuggling operation, which Abyanov said has been running for years.22"], "id": "1f9e5658bdb4ddda30cef077a627ca67a40e86a0a5e0007a74c6770fb28c3e2d", "highlighted_text": "While the U.S. position remains preeminent due to ties Russia has advanced further and faster as a competitive adversary the Gerasimov Doctrine is being implemented through a policy that incorporates military training and hardware, to directly displace U.S. influence.

It should disabuse Riyadh of any notion that the White House is willing or able to protect Saudi Arabia from congressionally-imposed sanctions, if the Saudis continue to stonewall international efforts to get to the bottom of the matter. In this context, Thursday\udbc0\udf5bs announcement that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had cancelled his participation in next week\udbc0\udf5bs Saudi investment summit is an appropriate and necessary signal. The U.S. cannot turn a blind eye to state-sponsored murder or allow it to pass without consequences. As a matter of principle, Washington should support free speech, a free press, and respect for the rule of law. It cannot give Saudi Arabia a free pass. If guilt is established, then it must hold the Saudis accountable. There must be real consequences for such a horrific act. Saudi officials found responsible for criminal acts should be removed from their positions and prosecuted. But until guilt has been established through a full investigation, it would be premature for U.S. officials to impose punitive measures against Saudi Arabia. Washington should not overreact by torpedoing the alliance , which could trigger even more dangerous actions by Saudi Arabia and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries, such as Iran, Russia, and China. If proven to have occurred, it is likely the murder of Khashoggi was motivated by a sense of insecurity and vulnerability.

During the span of the Bush and Obama administrations, total U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia increased by nearly 97 percent. The U.S. has offered $115 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia during the Obama administration. Over the last three years alone \u2014 since the start of negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program \u2014 America has sold nearly $36 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. These sales are certainly in the commercial interests of the United States and the American firms that manufacture the weapons . They create jobs , generate corporate profits , and improve the U.S. balance of trade . But whether the massive sale of American arms to the Saudis serves U.S. geopolitical interests is a much more debatable proposition. U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia is a mere tool of American policy toward the Kingdom, not an end in itself. As such, it should serve broader objectives in the relationship. It should influence the Saudi government to make decisions that support American interests and priorities in the relationship and in the region more broadly. The key question is this: What does the United States want from the Saudis, and how does U.S. military assistance to the Kingdom help or hurt its ability to achieve these goals? For years, the U.S.-Saudi relationship was underpinned by the deal of U.S. security in exchange for Saudi oil. But the United States currently buys very little oil from Saudi Arabia and is no longer dependent on Middle Eastern oil. The increase in U.S. oil and gas production means that Saudi Arabia is no longer even the key swing producer able to stabilize prices. Flexible U.S. producers now fulfill that function, without any government action. While Saudi Arabia is still one of the most important oil producers and continues exert its influence on the price of oil, changes in the energy market combined with Saudi Arabia\udbc0\udf5bs own financial situation mean the Saudi government is no longer able to use the oil price as a strategic weapon to either support or oppose U.S. policy. What remains is the idea that U.S. military assistance buys access to Saudi decision-making, but access is not the same as influence. The Saudis, in a form of reverse leverage, have often been able to use the American preoccupation with access to pursue more weapons deals . On the evidence, there is no basis for the belief that U.S. military assistance has led the Saudis to take actions that they would otherwise not have taken. And in the case of Yemen, there is clear evidence that this assistance has empowered the Saudis to take actions that are not in American interests.", "", ""], "id": "b41a9dceec6136526e7684659a4b65387decb17d811c0a2e6eeea25dfcaf4462", "highlighted_text": "the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia is big business Over the last three years America nearly $36 billion in arms sales are in the commercial interests of the U S that U.S. military assistance buys access to Saudi decision-making The Saudis have been able to use the American preoccupation with access to pursue more weapons deals", "highlights": [[2, 50, 61], [2, 67, 103], [2, 327, 352], [2, 428, 435], [2, 445, 471], [2, 495, 504], [2, 515, 551], [2, 557, 558], [2, 2164, 2230], [2, 2273, 2283], [2, 2316, 2320], [2, 2327, 2405], [2, 2406, 2411]], "underlines": [[2, 50, 61], [2, 62, 66], [2, 67, 103], [2, 103, 142], [2, 143, 228], [2, 327, 352], [2, 353, 358], [2, 428, 435], [2, 436, 444], [2, 445, 471], [2, 472, 494], [2, 495, 504], [2, 505, 514], [2, 515, 551], [2, 551, 556], [2, 557, 558], [2, 558, 607], [2, 608, 617], [2, 618, 629], [2, 630, 636], [2, 637, 645], [2, 656, 665], [2, 666, 697], [2, 698, 703], [2, 2139, 2163], [2, 2164, 2230], [2, 2273, 2283], [2, 2316, 2320], [2, 2321, 2326], [2, 2327, 2405], [2, 2406, 2411]], "emphasis": [[2, 50, 61], [2, 67, 103], [2, 327, 352], [2, 428, 435], [2, 445, 471], [2, 495, 504], [2, 515, 551], [2, 557, 558], [2, 2164, 2230], [2, 2273, 2283], [2, 2316, 2320], [2, 2327, 2405], [2, 2406, 2411]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2016-10-26"}, {"tag": "Arms deals critical to US defense base \u2013 Saudi Arabia is a vital market", "cite": "Ghoshal 15--- Debalina, Research Associate, Delhi Policy Group, \u201cThe softening of Saudi Arabia towards the Iranian nuclear deal would yield positive results in US-Saudi relations\u201d  MM", "body": ["", "Of course, while the Saudi Arabians might have mellowed down when it comes to the nuclear deal, this does not necessarily mean that they are attempting to improve relations with Iran.

Riyadh is the capital of its oil, and touching this would affect oil production before any other vital commodity. It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure to commit to producing 7.5 million barrels. If the price of oil reaching $80 angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure.

All of this will throw the Middle East, the entire Muslim world, into the arms of Iran, which will become closer to Riyadh than Washington. This is all when it comes to oil, but Saudi Arabia is not just about oil, it is a leader in the Muslim world with its standing and geographical importance. And perhaps trusted exchange of information between Riyadh and America and Western countries will be a thing of the past after it had contributed to the protection of millions of Westerners, as testified by senior Western officials themselves. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u2019s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. It will not be strange that Riyadh would stop buying weapons from the US. Riyadh is the most important customer of US companies, as Saudi Arabia buys 10 percent of the total weapons that these US companies produce, and buys 85 percent from the US army which means what\u2019s left for the rest of the world is only five percent; in addition to the end of Riyadh\u2019s investments in the US government which reaches $800 billion.

The high prices of the 1970s threw the world into a recession where absolute demand growth for oil did not just slow, but shrunk; global oil demand growth was 7.7 percent in 1972, but this number moved to negative territory in 1974 and 1975, and contracted again by nearly 4 percent in 1980 after the Iranian revolution and Saudi unrest 1979. Particularly at a time when people are actively debating \u201cpeak oil demand\u201d and alternative energies are becoming more affordable, the Saudis should be loath to give the world a further strong shove away from oil. Moreover, the reforms of the crown prince are, as would be expected, creating hardship for Saudis who have never had to think about employment or wasting energy. Taking action to cut oil production and, presumably, to accept lower revenues would constrain the ability of the Saudi government to manage its reform agenda and would create more opposition to it than the crown prince is already facing.

In his first news conference on Tuesday at the Pentagon as acting defense secretary, Shanahan said he plans to continue to oversee the space reorganization that started last year when he was deputy secretary of defense. He mentioned Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson as his closest collaborators. \u201cThe space effort is one area where I\u2019ll continue to work with Secretary Griffin and Dr. Wilson,\u201d said Shanahan. \u201cI won\u2019t be traveling as much.\u201d A proposal for the establishment of a U.S. Space Force is being finalized and will be sent to the White House for approval before it goes to Capitol Hill along with the budget request for fiscal year 2020. Inside the Pentagon, meanwhile, discussions continue on how to structure a Space Development Agency to be led by Griffin. \u201cInternally, the focus is on \u2018How do we go faster with delivering capability?\u2019\u201d Shanahan said. For the first time Shanahan confirmed that the Pentagon is proposing to establish a Space Force within the Department of the Air Force. He suggested that this is the most efficient option to add a new branch without running up overhead costs. \u201cWhen I go to the Hill to talk to members about where they have concerns or where their interests are, they are very focused on how do we not grow a bureaucracy, how do we not generate unnecessary cost.\u201d A White House policy memo agrees with the Pentagon\u2019s recommendation to place the Space Force in the Department of the Air Force but directs DoD to continue to plan for the creation of a separate Department of the Space Force. Shanahan is expecting some members of Congress to argue that the United States cannot afford the cost of standing up a new military service. \u201cI think about the discussions we\u2019re going to have over the next five to six months,\u201d he said. His response to lawmakers\u2019 concerns will be that the Space Force will be organized in a way that minimizes cost. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be small, as small as possible a footprint,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s been recommended it sits under the Air Force.\u201d The Pentagon has not revealed any estimates of the potential size or cost of a Space Force. An independent study by the Center for Naval Analyses suggested a Space Force would have 16,000 to 19,000 combined active duty and military personnel. By comparison, the smallest military service today, the Marine Corps, has 186,000 active-duty troops and is organized under the Department of the Navy. The thinking is that the Space Force will be small in size but heavy in technological might. Shanahan has been insistent that his immediate priority is to create a Space Development Agency to help inject innovation into military space programs and speed up the application of commercially available technology. At the press conference, Shanahan did drop a bit of news: A four-star nominee has been selected to lead a new combatant command for space. \u201cWe do have a person that we\u2019re going to move through,\u201d he said, although he would not disclose the name of the nominee or the proposed location of the new command. President Trump in a Dec. 18 memo instructed the Pentagon to establish a United States Space Command as a \u201cfunctional Unified Combatant Command.\u201d In opening remarks, Shanahan said the transition from deputy secretary to acting Pentagon chief has been seamless. After 29 days on the job, he said, \u201cthe terrain is not different or new.\u201d", ""], "id": "b4a01715db9b9c4902fb4b00d739ea2578a214a0bd0fa3755cdc2989b28623c0", "highlighted_text": "ERWIN 1/29 Shanahan anticipates months of negotiations with Congress Shanahan plans to continue to oversee A proposal for the Space Force being finalized before it goes to Capitol Hill Shanahan is expecting some members of Congress to argue his immediate priority is to create a Space Development Agency Shanahan said the transition has been seamless.", "highlights": [[3, 0, 10], [4, 46, 54], [4, 63, 74], [4, 75, 84], [4, 96, 108], [4, 109, 113], [4, 125, 133], [4, 272, 280], [4, 289, 297], [4, 298, 317], [4, 702, 720], [4, 745, 756], [4, 760, 765], [4, 766, 775], [4, 825, 855], [4, 1798, 1853], [4, 2807, 2810], [4, 2811, 2829], [4, 2830, 2869], [4, 3462, 3470], [4, 3471, 3490], [4, 3538, 3556]], "underlines": [[4, 13, 45], [4, 46, 54], [4, 55, 62], [4, 63, 74], [4, 114, 124], [4, 134, 186], [4, 272, 280], [4, 281, 288], [4, 289, 297], [4, 318, 406], [4, 702, 720], [4, 721, 744], [4, 745, 756], [4, 757, 759], [4, 760, 765], [4, 776, 824], [4, 856, 907], [4, 1168, 1260], [4, 1572, 1604], [4, 1798, 1853], [4, 2034, 2206], [4, 2286, 2377], [4, 2807, 2810], [4, 2830, 2869], [4, 2870, 2991], [4, 3462, 3470], [4, 3471, 3490], [4, 3491, 3537], [4, 3538, 3556]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local"}, {"tag": "Aid termination swamps upper leadership and muddles politics \u2013 multiple warrants for tradeoff", "cite": "SELVA 18 Paul J.

Tactical and operational successes do not possess intrinsic value but are worthwhile only to 24 the extent that they support larger policy aims. Yet historically the translation of military success into acceptable and sustainable outcomes has been one of the most difficult elements of campaigning. The problem is not merely conceptual. Commanders and their staffs must account for the changes in the political and public atmosphere that commonly take place in the period between the apparent military victory and a true consolidation of gains. In the flush of hard-won triumph, the Joint Force, USG, and American public have in the past experienced some combination of impatience, exuberant optimism, and division about what further aims to pursue. To varying extents, these problems impeded successful follow through in the aftermath of all major conflicts in U.S. history. By their nature, these currents are both unpredictable and largely beyond the control of military commanders. It is possible, however, for the Joint Force to anticipate these shifts and to seek to begin the consolidation of gains as early as possible in order to guard against changes. Commanders and staffs should assume that the withdrawal of resources, imposition of political constraints, and lack of focus will make it more rather than less difficult to achieve acceptable outcomes in the wake of armed conflict. The other consistent theme in history is that by virtue of their size and unique capabilities military forces will continue to play a major role, even if another USG department is in the lead. Wars disrupt political, social, and economic structures, networks, and institutions to the point it is often difficult for them to simply return to their pre-conflict state.

I can personally attest to this: While I was commander of the International Space Station in 2015, we had to maneuver our spaceship to avoid debris left over from a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile demonstration. The threat, however, is only going to get worse. The United States must proactively ensure its ability to operate and defend itself in space \u2014 which is why Congress needs to act to finalize the U.S. Space Force as a sixth independent branch of our armed forces. It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of space in our military operations and civilian life. Though the United States is the world\u2019s leader in space, China and Russia have made it clear they are not willing to accept the status quo. They already have access to weapons that threaten our assets in space, either by destroying them in orbit or by crippling ground control through cyberattacks or radio jamming. Since the Trump administration\u2019s recent announcement of plans to create a Space Force, there has been a fair amount of criticism stemming from a lack of understanding about what such a force would be. It wouldn\u2019t, of course, be a collection of \u201cStar Wars\u201d troops fighting battles in outer space. We cannot even call it a militarization of space \u2014 which already occurred in the 1950s when the Soviet army launched Sputnik and the U.S. Navy launched Vanguard. But the Space Force could address serious shortcomings in how effectively our military is organized. As the administration , the first steps toward creating a Space Force would include creating a subunified Space Command, a Space Operations Force that would initially recruit from the ranks of current military members and a Space Development Agency tasked with procuring space hardware. Though these steps can be taken without major congressional legislation, the final and most important step in creating the Space Force  of the U.S. Code, which outlines the role of armed forces. The last major rewrite was undertaken when the Air Force was created after World War II. Why should Congress make the Space Force a reality? Because space is important and unique enough to deserve its own place at the Defense Department table to ensure rightful allocation of budget resources and power. Our military uses a principle known as \u201cmultidomain warfare,\u201d meaning that when tasked with combat, different services all work jointly across the five domains \u2014 air, sea, land, space and cyber. However, in peacetime, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard only \u201corganize, train and equip\u201d by their specific domain. Space as a domain is now mature enough to stand alone. Today, there are officers who \u201cgrew up\u201d in Air Force Space Command, beginning as second lieutenants and making their way through the ranks to four-star general. It simply defies logic to keep that domain in the Air Force \u2014 akin to having the infantry in the Navy. Air and space are completely unrelated domains, and the equipment, techniques and culture required to operate airplanes are entirely different from those required to launch and operate in space. Though creating a Space Force makes sense from a theoretical point of view, there are legitimate practical concerns. The president wants a Space Force by 2020, a very ambitious timeline. However, the tight deadline serves to light a fire under the sprawling Pentagon bureaucracy, helping to prevent this initiative from floundering over a longer period. There would also be significant initial costs to standing up a new Space Force. In the long run, however, it would become more efficient as duplication across services was reduced. The devil is in the details. What exactly would the Space Force entail? I recommend that such a branch consolidate missions that launch and control satellites in orbit; that develop and procure space-related equipment; and that maintain our land-based nuclear missiles as well as our land-based missile-defense system (for example, to protect us from North Korean missiles). I would also consolidate cyberforces into the Space Force. Though cyber is also its own domain, it is not yet mature enough to warrant a separate Cyber Force. This would also be a sound decision from both an organizational efficiency and a cultural point of view. The 21st century will present continuous challenges to the United States, and we must realize that there is no \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d that guarantees our status as world leader. Now is the time to show leadership and vision by properly realigning our military with the reality that space is an essential and unique domain of modern warfare."], "id": "4d80d5c8676e3a306ea44d4e3ae992af2c61fd8861e3c21f557d8b6f6acc6203", "highlighted_text": "The threat is going to get worse The U S must proactively ensure its ability to operate in space China and Russia are not willing to accept the s quo Space as a domain is now mature enough to stand alone. 2020 tight deadline serves to light a fire under the Pentagon The 21st will present continuous challenges Now is time to lead", "highlights": [[2, 269, 279], [2, 290, 292], [2, 298, 316], [2, 318, 323], [2, 329, 330], [2, 336, 382], [2, 401, 409], [2, 681, 697], [2, 722, 753], [2, 759, 762], [2, 2618, 2623], [2, 2624, 2672], [2, 3286, 3290], [2, 3332, 3337], [2, 3338, 3379], [2, 3390, 3398], [2, 4306, 4314], [2, 4323, 4357], [2, 4480, 4486], [2, 4491, 4498], [2, 4504, 4508]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 51], [2, 316, 317], [2, 318, 323], [2, 323, 328], [2, 329, 330], [2, 330, 335], [2, 336, 382], [2, 383, 400], [2, 401, 409], [2, 531, 680], [2, 681, 697], [2, 698, 721], [2, 722, 753], [2, 753, 758], [2, 759, 762], [2, 800, 939], [2, 1285, 1397], [2, 1402, 1497], [2, 1859, 1920], [2, 1922, 1980], [2, 2130, 2283], [2, 2347, 2479], [2, 2618, 2623], [2, 2624, 2672], [2, 2983, 3131], [2, 4101, 4137], [2, 4148, 4151], [2, 4166, 4199], [2, 4306, 4314], [2, 4315, 4322], [2, 4323, 4357], [2, 4405, 4478], [2, 4499, 4503], [2, 4508, 4518], [2, 4538, 4544], [2, 4562, 4605], [2, 4617, 4642]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-08-23"}, {"tag": "Deterrence through strength prevents space wars \u2013 the impact is societal collapse", "cite": "PAOLETTA 17 Rae Paoletta, is the Senior Editor at Inverse, overseeing the space science vertical.

Their advice was seemingly bolstered by a Hill article penned by two national security experts this week, which reminded Americans that North Korea could in theory use a satellite weapon to send an electromagnetic pulse over the United States, triggering widespread blackouts and ultimately, societal collapse. It seems like all those Cold War fears Baby Boomers have repressed for decades are finally getting their chance! \u201cJust as nuclear assets deter aggression by convincing potential adversaries there\u2019s just no benefit to the attack, we have to maintain a space posture that communicates the same strategic message,\u201d US Navy Vice Admiral Charles A. Richard, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), said on March 22nd during a conference in Washington, D.C., as reported by Space.com. \u201cI submit [that] the best way to prevent war is to be prepared for war, and we\u2019re going to make sure that everyone knows we\u2019re going to be prepared to fight and win wars in all domains, to include space.\u201d As if that wasn\u2019t unsettling enough, a few weeks earlier, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein told Washington Post writer David Ignatius that his branch of military is working toward \u201cspace superiority,\u201d which he explained as \u201cfreedom from attack and freedom to maneuver.\u201d While Richard and Goldfein\u2019s comments might seem out of the blue, there\u2019s actually a long history of policy\u2014and action\u2014about space as a battleground. In 1967, toward the beginning of the Space Race, the United Nation\u2019s Outer Space Treaty banned the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction from being used anywhere in outer space. But that didn\u2019t stop Cold War powers from propagating the idea that an all-out space war was nigh\u2014in 1983, President Ronald Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also known as Star Wars, which was a plan to launch an anti-ballistic missile system into space to protect Americans from a Soviet attack. Similarly, Russians entertained the idea of creating \u201csuicide satellites,\u201d which were essentially spacecrafts with rapid-fire cannons attached to them. Like SDI, the idea was eventually scrapped. Then, in the early 2000s under the tenure of President George W. Bush, the notion of bringing our battles beyond Earth resurfaced again. \u201cThe idea of \u2018space war\u2019 lived primarily in science fiction realms for many years, but became a serious part of US policy discussions with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who talked about the inevitability of space warfare\u2014 because war had occurred in other domains of air, land and sea,\u201d Joan Johnson Freese, Professor and former Chair of National Security Affairs at the US Naval War College told Gizmodo. \u201c[He talked about] even a \u2018space Pearl Harbor.\u2019\u201d Things got a little more real in 2007, when China used an antisatellite weapon from Earth to blow apart one of its own weather satellites in space. Shortly after, the New York Times reported that arms control experts called the test a \u201ctroubling development that could foreshadow an antisatellite arms race.\u201d Once president Obama took office, there was a short cooling down period until 2013, when China launched a rocket that was ostensibly for a science mission; reportedly, some researchers were concerned that this was a practice run for future antisatellite weapons. Gizmodo has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment and will update this post if and when we hear back. \u201cWith the 2013 Chinese launch the consensus on strategic restraint began to unravel,\u201d Freese said. \u201cThe launch, coming soon after both Russia and China testing maneuverable satellites in low Earth orbit\u2014a capability that, until recently, had been demonstrated only by the United States\u2014led to something of a \u2018quiet panic\u2019 within the US national space security community.\u201d So while the fear of a space war is nothing new, this perennial anxiety doesn\u2019t get any easier to deal with. While recent comments from military officials might seem aggressive and sort of alarmist, Freese said that all things considered, they\u2019ve dialed it back quite a bit. To be fair, a shooting war in space could be disastrous for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), communications satellites, and by extension, the rest of us here on Earth. The human toll from an EMP attack that blacks out the electrical grid is also no laughing matter\u2014although claims that such an attack would kill 9 out of every 10 Americans may be a gross exaggeration. \u201cAir Force General and STRATCOM commander John Hyten has toned down that muscular rhetoric, now seemingly advocating deterrence to avoid conflict, because conflict will damage or destroy the space environment critical to US military and civilian daily operations,\u201d Freese said. \u201cThis more prudent approach makes much more sense\u2014in terms of achieving US space goals of stability, assured access and protection of the environment\u2014than saber rattling.\u201d"], "id": "6c5dd004df1ac8a42079d7a7e349553b6a859152a05d4a7aebab23923d3099d5", "highlighted_text": "North Korea could use a satellite weapon to e m p the U S triggering societal collapse space posture communicates strategic message the best way to prevent war is to be prepared we\u2019re going to make sure everyone knows we\u2019re going t fight and win a shooting war in space could be disastrous on Earth conflict will damage or destroy military and civilian operations", "highlights": [[2, 316, 333], [2, 344, 369], [2, 378, 379], [2, 385, 386], [2, 394, 395], [2, 405, 410], [2, 416, 417], [2, 424, 434], [2, 472, 489], [2, 742, 755], [2, 761, 773], [2, 783, 800], [2, 1004, 1049], [2, 1063, 1087], [2, 1093, 1121], [2, 1138, 1151], [2, 4282, 4314], [2, 4315, 4325], [2, 4452, 4460], [2, 4818, 4849], [2, 4887, 4908], [2, 4915, 4925]], "underlines": [[2, 82, 128], [2, 316, 333], [2, 334, 343], [2, 344, 369], [2, 370, 377], [2, 379, 385], [2, 386, 393], [2, 395, 404], [2, 405, 410], [2, 410, 415], [2, 416, 417], [2, 417, 423], [2, 435, 471], [2, 489, 603], [2, 605, 741], [2, 742, 755], [2, 756, 760], [2, 761, 773], [2, 774, 782], [2, 783, 800], [2, 800, 802], [2, 1050, 1062], [2, 1063, 1087], [2, 1088, 1092], [2, 1093, 1121], [2, 1121, 1137], [2, 1138, 1151], [2, 1152, 1191], [2, 2934, 3242], [2, 4104, 4193], [2, 4234, 4268], [2, 4462, 4542], [2, 4543, 4558], [2, 4780, 4817], [2, 4818, 4849], [2, 4850, 4886], [2, 4887, 4908], [2, 4909, 4914], [2, 4915, 4925], [2, 4969, 4974], [2, 4985, 4990], [2, 4991, 5012], [2, 5031, 5056], [2, 5057, 5060], [2, 5061, 5071], [2, 5072, 5090]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 11]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-03-30"}, {"tag": "***U \u2013 Top", "cite": "Topshelf uniqueness \u2013 Shanahan is making tangible strides on the proposal but it\u2019s due in 10 days and congressional support isn\u2019t locked", "body": ["WEISGERBER 2/12 Marcus Weisgerber, Marcus Weisgerber is the global business editor for Defense One, where he writes about the intersection of business and national security.

A separate space policy directive being prepped for Trump\u2019s signature, known as SPD-4, also describes the Space Force as being part of the Air Force. Under the proposal, Wilson would oversee the Space Force, just as Navy Secretary Richard Spencer oversees the Marine Corps. The proposal also calls for creating a Space Force undersecretary below Wilson, along with two four-star billets: a chief of staff who would be a member of the Joint Chiefs, and a vice chief of staff. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford were also said to share Wilson\u2019s reluctance to create a full separate service. But in the past few months, several defense and administration officials acknowledged a larger embracing of the issues, largely because the proposal limits the creation of new bureaucracy.

While I felt that eventually, we would need to create something like a Space Force given the growing economic and military importance of space, it seemed like too much change at once. Ideally, one would gradually transition to a Space Corps within the Air Force and then eventually to an independent Space Force, as previous studies have recommended. But Washington politics is not conducive to multi-phase reorganizations. If Congress passes legislation for an initial reorganization, there is no guarantee it will ever get around to finishing the job. We risk being left with a partial solution indefinitely. The cost of creating the Space Force is also a legitimate concern. In a , the Air Force estimates it would cost nearly $13 billion over five years to stand up both the Space Force and Space Command. To arrive at such a lofty figure, the Air Force assumed the broadest possible scope for the Space Force, even encompassing parts of NASA and the Department of Commerce. It also threw in a billion-dollar new headquarters building and assumed 13,000 new personnel would be needed. A Space Force that encompasses all of the space-related organizations in DoD and the intel community at the size they are today would likely be (roughly 50,000 active duty and civilian personnel). It therefore stands to reason that the new personnel needed to staff the Space Force\u2019s headquarters would be similar in size to the Coast Guard\u2019s headquarters staff (roughly 2,600 personnel, or about 5 percent of the total workforce), and all other Space Force personnel would be drawn from the existing space workforce spread across the Services and intel community. Using the same cost assumptions as the Air Force\u2019s estimate, the additional cost of standing up the Space Force would be less than $3 billion over five years. This is a small price to pay for the many problems a Space Force would help address. Space capabilities are already an indispensable component of U.S. military power, and the threats posed to U.S. space systems by China, Russia, and others are growing by the day. While reorganizing will certainly be disruptive in the short-term, it will be even more disruptive the longer we wait.

The reactions reveal a broad misunderstanding of what a Space Force would do or what it would look like. The most common critique was that the president had suddenly militarized space. He hadn\u2019t. That process began decades ago under President Eisenhower. In the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, President Eisenhower and the Congress created NASA to control all U.S. space activities except those \u201cpeculiar to or primarily associated with the development of weapons, military space operations, or the defense of the United States.\u201d That military job was handed to the Department of Defense. That same year, DoD created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA then, Defense ARPA or DARPA now) specifically to prevent the kind of technological surprise that Sputnik represented. ARPA quickly became the lead for all military space activities. While work actually took place in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, ARPA guided it; and over the next decade, just about every military mission we do today in space was birthed and tested. While in a classic sense many of those missions did not appear to be military weapons, they quickly became an integral part of the way the U.S. planned to execute war, specifically nuclear war. And in the nation\u2019s first space policy, National Security Council Planning Board memo 5814, Eisenhower envisioned that \u201cThe effective use of outer space\u2026will enhance [our] military capabilities. Military uses of outer space would include anti-ballistic missiles; communications, weather and navigation; defensive outer space vehicles; and even bombardment from space. Space has been militarized from the very beginning. And that\u2019s a good thing. Over the decades, those military space missions have saved tens of thousands of American, allied, and non-combatant lives, led to dramatic decreases in collateral damage, and allowed the U.S. and others to provide swift and timely responses to humanitarian needs and security crises worldwide.

From the scheming of lone extremists with no apparent connections to terrorist groups, like the ricin plots, to fighters aligned with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda in more than two dozen countries, terrorist threats are as complex and diverse as ever, American and other Western intelligence officials said in interviews. The Islamic State, in particular, is adapting to setbacks and increasingly using the tools of globalization \u2014 including Bitcoin and encrypted communications \u2014 to take their fight underground and rally adherents around the world. \u201cIf you look across the globe, the cohesive nature of the enterprise for ISIS has been maintained,\u201d Russell Travers, the acting head of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s not been any breaking up, at least not as yet,\u201d Mr. Travers said. \u201cThe message continues to resonate with way too many people.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s latest defense strategy elevates Russia and China above terrorism in the hierarchy of national threats. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met late last month with the four-star commanders of American Special Operations forces and troops in Africa to discuss options for halving the number of counterterrorism forces on the continent over the next three years, and assigning them new missions. Yet many counterterrorism specialists voiced concern that refocusing resources and political capital could go too far and give violent extremists time and space to regroup and rebound \u2014 much as the Islamic State did in 2013, emerging from the ashes of Al Qaeda in Iraq. \u201cTerrorist networks have spread,\u201d said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism to President Trump\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cI fear that without continuing counterterrorism pressure, where there are ungoverned spaces used as sanctuaries, there will be resurgent threats,\u201d said Mr. Costa, now the executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. American allies are echoing similar fears. \u201cEurope faces an intense, unrelenting and multidimensional international terrorist threat,\u201d Andrew Parker, the head of Britain\u2019s domestic spy service, MI5, said in a rare address in Berlin in May. The ledger on the Islamic State is a mix of glaring weaknesses and stubborn offsetting strengths. The Islamic State has lost nearly all of the territory it seized in 2014 in Iraq and Syria, but it still controls about 1,000 square miles, or roughly twice the size of Los Angeles, according to American officials. \u201cThere\u2019s still hard fighting ahead,\u201d Mr. Mattis told reporters last week. Many of the group\u2019s senior leaders have been killed. But American intelligence and military officials warn that the Islamic State still holds sway with a potent appeal on social media for adherents, from Europe to the Philippines, to carry out attacks wherever they are. Thousands of the roughly 40,000 fighters from more than 120 countries who joined the Islamic State in battle since 2014 died in Syria and Iraq, American and other Western officials said. But many thousands more probably slipped away to conflicts in Libya, Yemen or the Philippines, or went into hiding in countries like Turkey, the officials said. \u201cI worry about very seasoned fighters who will pop up periodically,\u201d said Mr. Travers, who noted that the continuing turmoil in Syria makes it harder for spy agencies to monitor terrorists on the run. \u201cSome are being tracked, some aren\u2019t.\u201d Even Islamic State fighters who have been caught pose a dilemma. The United States military is spending about $1 million to help detain thousands of Islamic State fighters and their family members in makeshift camps run by Kurdish militias in northern Syria, drawing the Pentagon deeper into the war-zone detention operations that it has sought to avoid. Critics fear the facilities could become breeding grounds for extremists and repeat a key security miscue of the Iraq war. The recently resumed offensive in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, called Operation Roundup, has swelled the number of people held in converted schools and office buildings to about 600 Islamic State fighters from more than 40 countries, military officials said. Only one country has agreed to repatriate its citizen-fighters, and American officials have refused to identify it, fearing the publicity would dissuade any other takers. New evidence of Islamic extremism has spread to countries that have not dealt with it before, like Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, a group that alternates between the names al-Sunnah wa Jama\u2019ah, Swahili Sunna or al\u2011Shabab, has unleashed a series of attacks on an impoverished region bordering Tanzania. Local officials said the group has no formal links with the Islamic extremist group Shabab in Somalia, but has copied many of their tactics. Since they appeared last October, the Mozambican Shabab have attacked police stations, government buildings and local villages. Last month alone, nearly 40 people died in the brutal attacks and more than 1,000 were displaced as the militants burned homes, stores and other buildings. The group\u2019s motivations for the attacks remain unknown. It has made no public statements, nor has it claimed credit for the attacks. But military and intelligence officials said it was most likely formed in reaction to the extreme poverty in Mozambique\u2019s only predominantly Muslim region. \u201cWe are at an inflection point in the broader campaign against terrorism,\u201d said Laith Alkhouri, a senior director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York, assessing the global terrorist threat. Over the past month alone, and armed with new authorities from Mr. Trump, American Special Operations forces continue to hunt Islamic State and Qaeda operatives. In June, Mr. Trump nominated a former member of the Navy SEALs, Vice Adm. Joseph Maguire, to be the next director of the National Counterterrorism Center. On June 6, an American Reaper drone killed four Islamic State fighters near Bani Walid, Libya, about 110 miles southeast of Tripoli, Libya\u2019s capital. A week later, another Reaper killed a Qaeda operative 50 miles southeast of Bani Walid. Ten days later, in central Yemen, American airstrikes attacked Qaeda fighters in the contested central Hadramout region. The risks of these missions was laid bare on June 8, when an American Special Operations soldier was killed and four others were wounded in an attack in southwestern Somalia against Shabab fighters. Even away from the battlefield, extremists on social media and the internet are proving to be potent. French authorities foiled a ricin plot by an Egyptian-born student in May after intercepting messages on the secure social media platform Telegram. And in Cologne, Germany, authorities acting on information from American intelligence agencies last month arrested a Tunisian man who tried to buy 1,000 castor bean seeds and a coffee grinder online. The shell of the castor bean is highly poisonous and can be used to make ricin. Plots involving ricin are not new. In 2011, for instance, American counterterrorism officials voiced increasing concern that Al Qaeda\u2019s most dangerous regional affiliate \u2014 its branch in Yemen \u2014 was trying to produce ricin, to be packed around small explosives for attacks against the United States. The threat never materialized. Now, officials worry that the know-how from these specialized battlefield plots and operations is seeping into everyday social media conduits, where they are available for aspiring terrorists and even lone actors in their own lethal plans. Mr. Travers declined to elaborate on the German plot. But, \u201cit does appear that the possibility of this kind of use is growing,\u201d he said, speaking broadly of extremists\u2019 use of chemical weapons and other poisons. \u201cAnd that is a concern to all of us.\u201d", ""], "id": "7302bc41e69ab9d8f5421d1ecc4c9a20352f8255307f295a247fc6de9ca3fb9a", "highlighted_text": "From the scheming of lone extremists to fighters aligned with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda terrorist threats are complex The Islamic State is adapting to setbacks without continuing counterterrorism pressure there will be resurgent threats The Islamic State has lost nearly all of the territory it seized in 2014 But American intelligence officials warn that the Islamic State still holds sway continuing turmoil in Syria makes it harder for spy agencies to monitor terrorists We are at an inflection point in the broader campaign against terrorism American Special Operations forces continue to hunt operatives", "highlights": [[4, 235, 271], [4, 344, 398], [4, 433, 454], [4, 458, 465], [4, 557, 574], [4, 591, 614], [4, 1960, 2004], [4, 2061, 2092], [4, 2523, 2595], [4, 2865, 2890], [4, 2904, 2958], [4, 3537, 3619], [4, 5677, 5748], [4, 5968, 6019], [4, 6044, 6054]], "underlines": [[4, 235, 271], [4, 272, 343], [4, 344, 398], [4, 399, 432], [4, 433, 454], [4, 458, 465], [4, 557, 574], [4, 591, 614], [4, 615, 747], [4, 1793, 1898], [4, 1960, 2004], [4, 2061, 2092], [4, 2185, 2227], [4, 2523, 2595], [4, 2596, 2661], [4, 2812, 2864], [4, 2865, 2890], [4, 2891, 2903], [4, 2904, 2958], [4, 2959, 3081], [4, 3537, 3619], [4, 3620, 3633], [4, 3633, 3669], [4, 5677, 5748], [4, 5748, 5749], [4, 5968, 6019], [4, 6020, 6043], [4, 6044, 6054], [4, 6054, 6055], [4, 7634, 7867]], "emphasis": [[4, 1960, 2004], [4, 2061, 2092], [4, 3537, 3619], [4, 3620, 3633], [4, 5677, 5748], [4, 5748, 5749]], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local"}, {"tag": "Terror causes extinction", "cite": "Jaspal 12 (Zafar Nawaz, Associate Professor at the School of Politics and International Relations, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan; \u201cNuclear/Radiological Terrorism: Myth or Reality?\u201d Journal of Political Studies, Vol. 19.1, 91-111)", "body": ["The misperception, miscalculation and above all ignorance of the ruling elite about security puzzles are perilous for the national security of a state. Indeed, in an age of transnational terrorism and unprecedented dissemination of dual-use nuclear technology, ignoring nuclear terrorism threat is an imprudent policy choice. The incapability of terrorist organizations to engineer fissile material does not eliminate completely the possibility of nuclear terrorism. At the same time, the absence of an example or precedent of a nuclear/ radiological terrorism does not qualify the assertion that the nuclear/radiological terrorism ought to be remained a myth. Farsighted rationality obligates that one should not miscalculate transnational terrorist groups \u2014 whose behavior suggests that they have a death wish \u2014 of acquiring nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological material producing capabilities. In addition, one could be sensible about the published information that huge amount of nuclear material is spread around the globe. According to estimate it is enough to build more than 120,000 Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs (Fissile Material Working Group, 2010, April 1). The alarming fact is that a few storage sites of nuclear/radiological materials are inadequately secured and continue to be accumulated in unstable regions (Sambaiew, 2010, February). Attempts at stealing fissile material had already been discovered (Din & Zhiwei, 2003: 18). \u00b6 Numerous evidences confirm that terrorist groups had aspired to acquire fissile material for their terrorist acts. Late Osama bin Laden, the founder of al Qaeda stated that acquiring nuclear weapons was a \u201creligious duty\u201d (Yusufzai, 1999, January 11). The IAEA also reported that \u201cal-Qaeda was actively seeking an atomic bomb.\u201d Jamal Ahmad al-Fadl, a dissenter of Al Qaeda, in his trial testimony had \u201crevealed his extensive but unsuccessful efforts to acquire enriched uranium for al-Qaeda\u201d (Allison, 2010, January: 11). On November 9, 2001, Osama bin Laden claimed that \u201cwe have chemical and nuclear weapons as a deterrent and if America used them against us we reserve the right to use them (Mir, 2001, November 10).\u201d On May 28, 2010, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a Pakistani nuclear scientist confessed that he met Osama bin Laden. He claimed that \u201cI met Osama bin Laden before 9/11 not to give him nuclear know-how, but to seek funds for establishing a technical college in Kabul (Syed, 2010, May 29).\u201d He was arrested in 2003 and after extensive interrogation by American and Pakistani intelligence agencies he was released (Syed, 2010, May 29). Agreed, Mr. Mahmood did not share nuclear know-how with Al Qaeda, but his meeting with Osama establishes the fact that the terrorist organization was in contact with nuclear scientists. Second, the terrorist group has sympathizers in the nuclear scientific bureaucracies. It also authenticates bin Laden\u2019s Deputy Ayman Zawahiri\u2019s claim which he made in December 2001: \u201cIf you have $30 million, go to the black market in the central Asia, contact any disgruntled Soviet scientist and a lot of dozens of smart briefcase bombs are available (Allison, 2010, January: 2).\u201d \u00b6 The covert meetings between nuclear scientists and al Qaeda members could not be interpreted as idle threats and thereby the threat of nuclear/radiological terrorism is real. The Defense Secretary Robert Gates admitted in 2008 that \u201cwhat keeps every senior government leader awake at night is the thought of a terrorist ending up with a weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear (Mueller, 2011, August 2).\u201d Indeed, the nuclear deterrence strategy cannot deter the transnational terrorist syndicate from nuclear/radiological terrorist attacks. Daniel Whiteneck pointed out:\u00b6 \u201cEvidence suggests, for example, that al Qaeda might not only use WMD simply to demonstrate the magnitude of its capability but that it might actually welcome the escalation of a strong U.S. response, especially if it included catalytic effects on governments and societies in the Muslim world. An adversary that prefers escalation regardless of the consequences cannot be deterred\u201d (Whiteneck, 2005, Summer: 187)\u00b6 Since taking office, President Obama has been reiterating that \u201cnuclear weapons represent the \u2018gravest threat\u2019 to United States and international security.\u201d While realizing that the US could not prevent nuclear/radiological terrorist attacks singlehandedly, he launched 47an international campaign to convince the international community about the increasing threat of nuclear/ radiological terrorism. He stated on April 5, 2009: \u201cBlack market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold (Remarks by President Barack Obama, 2009, April 5).\u201d He added: \u201cOne terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe\u201d (Remarks by President Barack Obama, 2009, April 5). In July 2009, at the G-8 Summit, President Obama announced the convening of a Nuclear Security Summit in 2010 to deliberate on the mechanism to \u201csecure nuclear materials, combat nuclear smuggling, and prevent nuclear terrorism\u201d (Luongo, 2009, November 10). President Obama\u2019s nuclear/radiological threat perceptions were also accentuated by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1887 (2009). The UNSC expressed its grave concern regarding \u2018the threat of nuclear terrorism.\u201d It also recognized the need for all States \u201cto take effective measures to prevent nuclear material or technical assistance becoming available to terrorists.\u201d The UNSC Resolution called \u201cfor universal adherence to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and its 2005 Amendment, and the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\u201d (UNSC Resolution, 2009)"], "id": "03ce32d13047e2ba838c08b16c358bfc3d1aa7e62b4e37021b47d23d38e21af8", "highlighted_text": "ignoring terrorism is an imprudent policy choice. rationality obligates that one not miscalculate groups \u2014 whose behavior suggests a death wish nuclear material is spread around the globe to build more than 120,000 bombs storage sites are inadequately secured in unstable regions Attempts had already been discovered the group has sympathizers in nuclear scientific bureaucracies. any disgruntled scientist and dozens of briefcase bombs are available \u201cEvidence suggests al Qaeda might use WMD simply to demonstrate its capability it might welcome escalation of a strong U.S. response, especially catalytic effects An adversary that prefers escalation regardless of consequences cannot be deterred\u201d One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.", "highlights": [[2, 261, 269], [2, 278, 287], [2, 295, 325], [2, 672, 702], [2, 710, 726], [2, 751, 783], [2, 799, 811], [2, 994, 1037], [2, 1074, 1100], [2, 1125, 1130], [2, 1212, 1225], [2, 1260, 1284], [2, 1316, 1335], [2, 1364, 1372], [2, 1402, 1429], [2, 2803, 2806], [2, 2817, 2842], [2, 2847, 2880], [2, 3055, 3070], [2, 3078, 3091], [2, 3101, 3110], [2, 3117, 3146], [2, 3758, 3776], [2, 3796, 3810], [2, 3820, 3849], [2, 3867, 3881], [2, 3891, 3899], [2, 3909, 3916], [2, 3921, 3969], [2, 3985, 4002], [2, 4053, 4103], [2, 4108, 4140], [2, 5023, 5095]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 158], [2, 261, 269], [2, 278, 287], [2, 295, 325], [2, 326, 329], [2, 672, 702], [2, 703, 709], [2, 710, 726], [2, 727, 750], [2, 751, 783], [2, 784, 798], [2, 799, 811], [2, 812, 906], [2, 979, 993], [2, 994, 1037], [2, 1037, 1038], [2, 1061, 1073], [2, 1074, 1100], [2, 1101, 1124], [2, 1125, 1130], [2, 1180, 1211], [2, 1212, 1225], [2, 1226, 1259], [2, 1260, 1284], [2, 1285, 1315], [2, 1316, 1335], [2, 1364, 1372], [2, 1373, 1401], [2, 1402, 1429], [2, 1458, 1679], [2, 1710, 1785], [2, 2728, 2794], [2, 2803, 2806], [2, 2807, 2816], [2, 2817, 2842], [2, 2843, 2846], [2, 2847, 2880], [2, 2978, 3054], [2, 3055, 3070], [2, 3071, 3077], [2, 3078, 3091], [2, 3092, 3100], [2, 3101, 3110], [2, 3111, 3116], [2, 3117, 3146], [2, 3179, 3353], [2, 3412, 3488], [2, 3489, 3562], [2, 3591, 3726], [2, 3758, 3776], [2, 3776, 3795], [2, 3796, 3810], [2, 3811, 3819], [2, 3820, 3849], [2, 3850, 3866], [2, 3867, 3881], [2, 3882, 3890], [2, 3891, 3899], [2, 3900, 3908], [2, 3909, 3916], [2, 3917, 3920], [2, 3921, 3969], [2, 3985, 4002], [2, 4053, 4103], [2, 4104, 4107], [2, 4108, 4140], [2, 4236, 4329], [2, 4604, 4958], [2, 5023, 5095], [2, 5096, 5178]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2012-01-01"}, {"tag": "Link \u2013 General", "cite": "Heinrech et al. 17 [Tobias, University of Southern California, Carla Martinez Machain, Kansas State University, Jared Oestman, Rice University, \u201cDoes counterterrorism militarize foreign aid?

In our theory, we address how a change in the security concerns of the United States in a region can lead to aid being used as a counterterrorism tool through the aforementioned channels. Once aid takes on this form, we then expect the composition of aid to shift as well. When terrorist groups either initiate or expand operations in a new region, states in that area will increase in salience to the United States (Aning, 2010; Bell, Clay & Martinez Machain, 2016). This is particularly true in the case of al-Qaeda and its affiliate groups, which explicitly aim to target the United States and its allies and pose a threat to the interests of the United States (Elworthy & Rogers, 2002; Aning, 2010). These groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations that seek independence, for example (Cronin, 2006). Thus, as al-Qaeda increases its presence in one state, the United States will have an incentive to bolster the counterterrorism efforts of not only that state, but its neighbors as well. We argue that because these terrorist groups are not necessarily identified with a particular state, but rather move into areas that provide them the opportunity to operate more freely, security concerns will have a geographical spillover effect (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). This may happen either because the United States will be concerned that the terrorists will move into neighboring countries or because the United States will find that it is most effective to fight the terrorist group by increasing the counterterrorism efforts of neighboring countries (Drakos & Gofas, 2006). Figure 1 presents the (log-scaled) relative magnitude of the different types of aid that the United States gives to sub-Saharan Africa. In the post-9/11 era, there has been a clear upward trend of increases in not only military aid, but also civil society and total development aid.6 Figure 1 about here These trends are reflective of the increased prominence of sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to US foreign aid allocation. We will begin by focusing on military aid. When foreign aid is used as a tool of counterterrorism, it is more likely to be channeled directly through to the executive branch of the recipient country, which generally controls military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement and is able to implement the preferred policies of the donor, in exchange for the resources received (Scahill, 2013). Other actors in the recipient state, such as foreign non-governmental organizations, the news media, or civil society associations that do not have control over the state\u2019s security forces clearly lack the capacity to actually carry out counterterrorism operations.7 We thus argue that when the United States wants the recipient state to engage in counterterrorism, it will give more foreign aid that takes the form of military aid that will actually carry out the counterterrorism policy. Our first hypothesis suggests that states that experience direct attacks by al-Qaeda or affiliates will receive increased military aid: Hypothesis 1: As al-Qaeda carries out attacks in a state, the recipient state will receive more military aid."], "id": "dff51a87996f3e935c9904e822db50b3e3a7b90173e335fa240c61849f13a386", "highlighted_text": "When aid is used as a counterterrorism tool, it bolster the capabilities of a state that is fighting or to buy counterterrorism cooperation groups have wider aims than other terrorists organizations the U S will have an incentive to bolster the counterterror efforts of its neighbors as well. focusing on military aid military operations, intelligence gathering, and law enforcement the form of military aid carry out counterterror policy.", "highlights": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 48, 69], [2, 70, 122], [2, 123, 133], [2, 134, 172], [2, 173, 216], [2, 282, 438], [2, 525, 667], [2, 956, 961], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1021, 1043], [2, 1079, 1126], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1133, 1138], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1140, 1145], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1197, 1200], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1212, 1236], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 1274, 1505], [2, 2266, 2282], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2309, 2490], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 2556, 2656], [2, 2674, 2709], [2, 2871, 2938], [2, 2960, 3047], [2, 3048, 3069], [2, 3070, 3080], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3106, 3124], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3135, 3138], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3152, 3155], [2, 3156, 3163]], "emphasis": [[2, 0, 47], [2, 70, 122], [2, 134, 172], [2, 962, 995], [2, 996, 1006], [2, 1007, 1020], [2, 1128, 1133], [2, 1139, 1140], [2, 1146, 1197], [2, 1201, 1211], [2, 1237, 1259], [2, 2283, 2307], [2, 2491, 2555], [2, 3081, 3105], [2, 3125, 3134], [2, 3139, 3152], [2, 3156, 3163]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8], [9, 18]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "Link \u2013 Chad", "cite": "Eizenga 18 Daniel Eizenga is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science and a research associate with the Sahel Research Group based at the University of Florida.

When the group became violent in 2009, the Chadian government viewed it as a Nigerian problem, but inevitably the conflict began to spill over the border. Beginning in 2014, Nigerian refugees began seeking shelter from Boko Haram in Chad\u2019s Lac Region, which comprises the Chadian territory around Lake Chad. Boko Haram targeted these communities of people, connected through ethnicity and a long history of economic trade, as it established its so-called \u2018caliphate\u2019 in northeastern Nigeria. The first attack by Boko Haram in Chad took place against Nigerian refugees in the small village of Dubawa (Menner, 2014). Attacks significantly increased in the Lac Region over the course of 2015 resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Chadians (Map 2). In light of the growing instability across the lake in Nigeria, the Chadian military took action to root out Boko Haram from its stronghold in Borno State where Boko Haram had focused a disproportionate number of its attacks (Van Den Hoek, 2017). The Chadian military deployed 2,500 soldiers after Boko Haram massacred the Nigerian village of Baga, during which some 2,000 people were killed (BBC, 2015). The deployment sent Chadian soldiers around Lake Chad crossing into Niger and Cameroon simultaneously to enter Nigeria as part of a co-ordinated operation to remove Boko Haram from an area roughly the size of Belgium. Boko Haram responded to the deployment of the Chadian military by attacking villages throughout the larger region of the Lake Chad Basin destroying Nigerian, Cameroonian, and Chadian villages resulting in over 28 000 deaths from 2009 to 2016 according to ACLED data (ACLED, 2017) and 2.4 million displaced persons as of March 2017 according to the World Food Programme (WFP, 2017). This widespread insecurity in the Lac Region alone caused the Chadian National Assembly to establish a state of emergency in the region, effectively placing it under military administration in November 2015. Since then the state of emergency has been renewed by the National Assembly several times. Boko Haram\u2019s retaliation against Chadian security forces also took place outside of the Lac Region. In June 2015, suicide bombers on motorcycles simultaneously attacked the police headquarters and the national police academy in N\u2019Djamena, killing 37 people and wounding more than 100 others. At least four of the dead were suspected Boko Haram fighters. These co-ordinated suicide bombings were the first of their kind to take place in N\u2019Djamena. The following day, two men tried to detonate suicide bombs outside the central police station but were intercepted and arrested. These attacks spurred a significant crackdown by security forces in N\u2019Djamena, which implemented several checkpoints throughout the city. However, a police operation investigating a suspected Boko Haram cell in N\u2019Djamena resulted in the death of five police officers and six Boko Haram militants who detonated a suicide bomb upon being discovered. In July 2015, another suicide attack claimed the lives of at least 15 people and wounded over 70 others after an explosion took place near the capital\u2019s central market (BBC, 2015b). These deteriorating conditions led the Chadian government to increase its police presence in the capital, ban the burqa, and reinstate the death penalty for terrorist crimes by the end of 2015 (BBC, 2015c). The Chadian military mission against Boko Haram successfully sent the violent extremist organization into hiding around the swamps and islands of Lake Chad as well as in the Mandara Mountains between Nigeria and northern Cameroon. It also led to the rejuvenation of the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) with its headquarters based in N\u2019Djamena and which co-ordinates military efforts between Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Niger to fight Boko Haram. During 2017, Chadian soldiers continued to play a significant role providing security in the Lake Chad Basin through the MNJTF. The Chadian military also established additional headquarters in Baga Sola to protect refugees in the Lac Region, where a state of emergency, restrictive anti-terror laws and a curfew were established in a bid to restore security for the Chadian region. Initially, the increased presence of the military resulted in a rise in suicide attacks from Boko Haram militants targeting the newly arrived security forces. Recently, however, attacks on Chadian soil appear to be in decline (Dowd, 2018) as Boko Haram seems to have re-focused its targets on Maiduguri and surrounding towns in northern Nigeria. However, many analysts continue to warn against the presence of Boko Haram fighters around Lake Chad and their potential to provoke further insecurity in Chad as well as in neighbouring countries. This is especially the case due to the rising number of civilian victims in the most recent attacks claimed by Boko Haram. In October 2017, Chadian troops providing security against Boko Haram in the Diffa region of northeastern Niger were moved to northwestern Chad near the border with southern Libya following reports of increased Chadian rebel activity in that area. Shortly thereafter, on 19 October 2017, three Chadian rebels were arrested in Agadez, Niger, after crossing the Nigerien border with southern Libya. If conflict in southern Libya were to spill over into Chad or Niger, another counter-terrorism front could open up in this already destabilised region.2", ""], "id": "ec88e9c87aba6ad83e6120728bead79b533bfc69751bc2d612e9351ba446215e", "highlighted_text": "the regional role of the Chadian military is most important in the conflict against Boko Haram Chadian military deployed 2,500 soldiers after Boko Haram massacred The mission sent the violent organi z ation into hiding attacks in decline as Boko Haram re-focused its targets analysts continue to warn against the presence and their potential to provoke further insecurity in Chad as well as in neighbouring countries", "highlights": [[2, 7, 51], [2, 60, 74], [2, 75, 109], [2, 1108, 1175], [2, 3474, 3477], [2, 3495, 3502], [2, 3535, 3551], [2, 3562, 3568], [2, 3568, 3569], [2, 3569, 3586], [2, 4495, 4502], [2, 4532, 4542], [2, 4556, 4569], [2, 4584, 4606], [2, 4677, 4723], [2, 4764, 4835], [2, 4836, 4848], [2, 4849, 4858]], "underlines": [[2, 7, 51], [2, 52, 59], [2, 60, 74], [2, 75, 109], [2, 417, 601], [2, 1104, 1107], [2, 1108, 1175], [2, 1176, 1248], [2, 1262, 1393], [2, 1394, 1406], [2, 1407, 1478], [2, 3267, 3459], [2, 3474, 3477], [2, 3478, 3494], [2, 3495, 3502], [2, 3503, 3521], [2, 3522, 3534], [2, 3535, 3551], [2, 3552, 3561], [2, 3562, 3568], [2, 3568, 3569], [2, 3569, 3586], [2, 3587, 3703], [2, 3948, 4061], [2, 4495, 4502], [2, 4503, 4531], [2, 4532, 4542], [2, 4543, 4555], [2, 4556, 4569], [2, 4570, 4583], [2, 4584, 4606], [2, 4607, 4661], [2, 4672, 4676], [2, 4677, 4723], [2, 4724, 4763], [2, 4764, 4835], [2, 4836, 4848], [2, 4849, 4858], [2, 5380, 5510], [2, 5511, 5523], [2, 5524, 5530]], "emphasis": [[2, 60, 74], [2, 3535, 3551], [2, 3552, 3561], [2, 3562, 3568], [2, 3568, 3569], [2, 3569, 3586]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-02-01"}, {"tag": "The aff cuts key communication networks and kills key alliances", "cite": "Quist-Arcton 17 - Ofeibea Quist-Arcton (award-winning broadcaster from Ghana and NPR's Africa Correspondent), 4-17-2017, \"Amid Aid Uncertainty, U.S. Counterterrorism Cooperation Continues In Africa,\" NPR.org, https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/04/17/521400443/amid-aid-uncertainty-u-s-counter-terrorism-cooperation-continues-in-africa WJ recut", "body": ["Along the Chari and Logone rivers separating Cameroon from Chad's capital, four flat-bottomed boats, mounted with machine guns, brimming with Chadian and other special forces, round the curve as they approach the riverbank. Forming an assault force, heavily armed soldiers leap out of the vessels and race up a slope to take up positions while backup forces have their machine guns at the ready. It's all part of a military exercise that simulates going after a high-value target \u2013 a leader from the ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram insurgency, who's taken up residence in a huddle of huts on the far side of the riverfront, a terrorist safe haven. The assault force demonstrates crucial military steps before capturing and eliminating him. Three weeks of U.S.-led counterterrorism exercises, known as Flintlock 2017, ended last month in Chad, which, along with surrounding countries, has been targeted in deadly violence by Boko Haram. The Flintlock exercises take place each year in a different African country. Boko Haram's 8-year-old uprising began in northeastern Nigeria, to the west of Chad, and has spilled over its borders, killing thousands of people and driving almost 3 million from their homes across the region. The war left a humanitarian catastrophe in its wake. The Trump administration's budget blueprint pledges to boost U.S. military spending by 10 percent \u2014 but also promises deep cuts in foreign aid. It's not yet clear what that might mean for U.S. counterterrorism efforts here or elsewhere in Africa, though the White House has boosted the U.S. military's authority to carry out strikes in Somalia against al-Shabaab militants linked to al-Qaida. At the same time, the U.S. \u2014 the biggest donor to the United Nations \u2014 is making the case for cuts in U.N. funding and wants to see changes in U.N. peacekeeping operations, most of which take place in Africa. \"We need to show results,\" U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said earlier this month. \"We need to find value.\" Support for foreign nations' counterterrorism efforts, as opposed to big American deployments, were a key tool of the Obama administration. Last year, the U.S. gave $156 million for military support, training and border security in the region straddling Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, known as the Lake Chad Basin. The military officer in charge of Flintlock 2017, Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, has called this region \"Ground Zero\" when it comes to fighting extremism in Africa. Bolduc, the Special Operations commander in Africa, says for now, the U.S. military is continuing to pursue its objectives. But the prospect of aid cuts worries many, as the region's humanitarian situation risks deteriorating. The U.N. warns there is a risk of famine in Nigeria's northeast, exacerbating a humanitarian disaster that has already seen children, especially those under the age of 5, dying of malnutrition, hunger and starvation. The U.S. has given more than $321 million since last year to help those in the Lake Chad Basin, including more than $175 million in emergency food aid. \"Our assistance to this area is critical for promoting stability,\" said Matt Nims of the U.S. Agency for International Development, speaking at a House subcommittee hearing earlier this month. 'The military can't do it by itself' U.S. special operations troops don't typically deploy in large numbers to help African security forces work together and fight Boko Haram, but local officials say they're useful in serving as the glue that helps everything stick together. For Flintlock 2017, forces from 27 countries took part at seven training sites across west and central Africa. \"Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger \u2013 unfortunately, the entire region, we are facing the same reality,\" said Cameroonian police commander Gilbert Nagassou, in charge of the border post at Kousseri, just across the river separating Chad and Cameroon. \"That's why we must join forces and together confront terrorism.\" When it comes to fighting Boko Haram's threats to the Lake Chad Basin, \"The military can't do it by itself,\" Bolduc told NPR in Ndjamena, Chad's capital. \"Regionalize all the efforts, work closely together in an effective military construct ... and then bring in the police, the civil administration, religious leaders and include anybody working to bring the stability necessary to the local villages.\" A U.S. special forces commander involved in Flintlock, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons, says the challenges shouldn't be underestimated. \"We have a regional issue of Boko Haram, [which] easily exploits the seams between international boundaries \u2013 especially when you have something like a river way that separates two nations,\" he says. \"And they currently use islands in this pretty broad [Chari and Logone] river to hide out in. It's an easy area to have ungoverned and hard to police and patrol.\" Members of U.S. military and, for the first time, law enforcement agencies are working with African security forces to enhance their techniques, said Billy Alfano, a special agent with the State Department's law enforcement arm, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. \"Interoperability\" \u2013 groups and forces working well together \u2014 is the current buzzword. \"It's critical for our African partner nations to work together and more and more important for police to collaborate with the military, to conduct joint investigations and to truly counter the terrorism threat in the region, with law enforcement in those communities,\" Alfano said. Law enforcement agents are often first responders after an attack, he explained, so training them in forensics and skills like fingerprinting also helps \"attack the terrorist network.\" Alfano said this year's more broadly focused exercises reflected an emphasis on governance and rule of law, \"making a transition from a military-controlled area to training the police to more effectively take over when the military has moved on.\" And there was what he called \"a mass migration training,\" to teach rural communities how to respond to potential terrorists who may cross porous borders where large numbers of people are already traveling. Cross-border cooperation During Flintlock, training scenarios involved agents from across the region simulating the aftermath of a terrorist bombing, as well as chasing and apprehending hostage-taking terrorist suspects. \"Terrorism knows no boundaries or borders,\" warned Nagassou, the Cameroonian police commander. Deadly Boko Haram bomb blasts and suicide bombing raids have targeted all four countries battling the terrorist network, he said. \"Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to Islamic State,\" he said, \"so geographic frontiers mean nothing to this group or other terrorist networks and their regional allies. Borders are simply a joke to them \u2014 they have connections and communications.\" Terrorists, he said, easily slip across. \"If there's intelligence from Nigeria and it's relayed to Chad, then Cameroon must also be made aware,\" said Nagassou. \"And Niger also needs to be informed, so that together we can nip Boko Haram's nefarious plans in the bud and stop them attacking our people.\" Battle-hardened Chadian special forces are already familiar with this problem. For the past few years, they've been taking on Boko Haram extremists since violence spread across the border from northeastern Nigeria. They also were a critical force that helped end the occupation of northern Mali by al-Qaida-linked extremist fighters in 2013. \"Chadian military history has demonstrated our experience and know-how. It's not today that the Chadian army is learning how to capture and destroy the enemy. Chadian forces are used to pursuing Boko Haram,\" said Lt. Col. Brahim Mahamat Dahab, Chad's chief of staff for the Flintlock 2017 exercises. He says the river scenario assault force exercise shows that Chad is capable of working with Americans, Italians \"and the military from any given country, as well as our neighbors, reinforcing capacity. That's what we want to demonstrate. We need to share that knowledge with others who are also fighting Boko Haram,\" Brahim told NPR passionately.", ""], "id": "732ed743952867b1c660b1cd95b66f90f71d267614b1a6841b583b2420911ac4", "highlighted_text": "Chad has been targeted in deadly violence by Boko Haram Boko Haram's 8-year-old spilled over its borders, killing thousands The Trump administration's budget blueprint pledges deep cuts in foreign aid the U.S. gave $156 million for the region Ground Zero\" when it comes to fighting extremism in Africa the prospect of aid cuts worries many military can't do it by itself' U.S. troops don't deploy in large numbers Boko Haram easily exploits the seams It's an easy area to have ungoverned and hard to police and patrol Members of U.S. military are working to enhance their techniques Chadian special forces are already familiar they've been taking on Boko Haram extremists Chad is capable of working with Americans We need to share that knowledge with others", "highlights": [[2, 832, 836], [2, 879, 929], [2, 1008, 1031], [2, 1101, 1144], [2, 1273, 1324], [2, 1391, 1415], [2, 2131, 2161], [2, 2212, 2222], [2, 2399, 2457], [2, 2587, 2624], [2, 3253, 3284], [2, 3285, 3289], [2, 3309, 3321], [2, 3332, 3355], [2, 4543, 4553], [2, 4563, 4588], [2, 4808, 4874], [2, 4877, 4901], [2, 4952, 4963], [2, 4993, 5020], [2, 7164, 7207], [2, 7251, 7295], [2, 7851, 7892], [2, 8029, 8072]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 19], [2, 20, 26], [2, 27, 222], [2, 224, 394], [2, 832, 836], [2, 879, 929], [2, 1008, 1031], [2, 1032, 1070], [2, 1093, 1100], [2, 1101, 1144], [2, 1145, 1154], [2, 1273, 1324], [2, 1325, 1390], [2, 1391, 1415], [2, 1980, 2118], [2, 2131, 2161], [2, 2212, 2222], [2, 2223, 2254], [2, 2269, 2297], [2, 2375, 2399], [2, 2399, 2457], [2, 2583, 2586], [2, 2587, 2624], [2, 2624, 2684], [2, 3056, 3119], [2, 3248, 3252], [2, 3253, 3284], [2, 3285, 3289], [2, 3290, 3308], [2, 3309, 3321], [2, 3322, 3331], [2, 3332, 3355], [2, 3356, 3522], [2, 3636, 3733], [2, 4103, 4349], [2, 4515, 4542], [2, 4543, 4553], [2, 4553, 4562], [2, 4563, 4588], [2, 4589, 4702], [2, 4808, 4874], [2, 4877, 4901], [2, 4902, 4951], [2, 4952, 4963], [2, 4964, 4992], [2, 4993, 5020], [2, 5709, 5941], [2, 6887, 6994], [2, 6995, 7003], [2, 7003, 7145], [2, 7164, 7207], [2, 7208, 7225], [2, 7251, 7295], [2, 7296, 7361], [2, 7851, 7892], [2, 7945, 8028], [2, 8029, 8072], [2, 8073, 8105]], "emphasis": [[2, 2583, 2586], [2, 2587, 2624], [2, 2624, 2684], [2, 4808, 4874]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [6, 12], [13, 15]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-04-17"}, {"tag": "Boko Haram can get nukes", "cite": "Porter 16 Rc Porter, 3-26-2016, \"Terrorist Groups Like The Islamic State, Boko Haram, al-Qaeda Have The 'Means, Knowledge, And Information' To Create A Nuclear Bomb Says Head Of U.N.'s Atomic Agency,\" Fortuna's Corner,  / MM", "body": ["*Brackets in original article", "Imogen Calderwood writes on the March 25, 2016 website of London\u2019s The Daily Mail Online, that \u201cterrorists have the means, knowledge and information to create a nuclear bomb.\u201d This, according to Yukiya Amano, the Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \u201cTerrorism is spreading, and the possibility of [them] using nuclear material in some deadly and malicious way cannot be excluded,\u201d Dr. Amano told Agency France Presse (AFP). \u201cMember states eed to have sustained interest in strengthening nuclear security.\u201d Dr. Amano\u2019s comments come as 50 world leaders are about to gather in Washington D.C. for a summit on March 31, 2016, to discuss ways to address [nuclear security issues at 1,000 atomic facilities worldwide.

One of the more notable examples of Saudi Arabia\u2019s increasingly important role in combatting terrorism was the foiled 2010 AQAP cargo plane bomb plot. According to a story in the New York Times, Saudi intelligence provided the critical tipoff to the American and European intelligence officials that allowed British and Emirati security personnel to intercept the expertly concealed bombs that were already en route to the United States.[12] The last minute intelligence was the product of long-running Saudi intelligence operations to infiltrate AQAP.[13] The Saudi connection was probably decisive as the concealed explosives had already cleared multiple security screenings before the timely Saudi warning initiated the successful multilateral worldwide search.[14] In addition to these human intelligence capabilities within jihadist circles (not easily matched by Western intelligence), Saudi Arabia also plays a central role in the U.S. campaign against AQAP in Yemen by hosting a base for drone and other attacks in Yemen according to the BBC.[15] The Islamic State, like Al Qaeda, is also considered a top security threat by the Saudi regime. The Islamic State has declared Saudi Arabia to be its enemy, and its propaganda shows its black flag flying above Mecca. Islamic State terrorists have attacked Shi\u2019a Muslim mosques in the Kingdom and Saudi security officials. The Islamic State also called on Saudi subjects to assassinate senior Saudi leaders. More broadly, the Islamic State threatens the regime\u2019s legitimacy, claiming that it \u2013 rather than the Kingdom \u2013 is the true embodiment of a state under God\u2019s law. It has called the royal family \u201cslaves of the Crusaders and allies of the Jews\u201d and derided them for abandoning Muslims around the world.[16] The Saudi government response to the Islamic State has been strong. The government has taken steps to stop Saudis from travelling abroad to support the Islamic State and other groups, including the arrest of those who traveled abroad to fight with radical groups. In addition, it has arrested more than 1,600 suspected Islamic State supporters in the Kingdom and reportedly foiled several attacks.[17] U.S. Treasury officials have declared the Saudis see \u201ceye to eye\u201d with the United States in stopping Islamic State fundraising, and the Kingdom has stepped up its monitoring of social media.[18] Senior religious officials with close ties to the royal family have also denounced the Islamic State (and Al Qaeda).[19] The Kingdom announced it was forming an \u201cIslamic\u201d military alliance, headquartered in Saudi Arabia, to fight terrorism."], "id": "b514d136caf76272983a49a99dcaaab37daa543fb7e61bee1e1f9e08f4db1f04", "highlighted_text": "The current Crown Prince led the campaign against Al Qaeda the Kingdom embraced intelligence cooperation with the U S the U S provides advisors to assist on security measures Saudi officials are vital counterterrorism allies Saudi role foiled 2010 AQAP cargo plane bomb plot Saudi plays a central role in the U.S. campaign by hosting a base for attacks in Yemen The Saudi government response to the I S has been strong it has arrested more than 1,600 supporters and foiled several attacks U.S . officials have declared the Saudis see \u201ceye to eye\u201d with the U S in stopping I S", "highlights": [[2, 257, 315], [2, 403, 459], [2, 465, 466], [2, 807, 812], [2, 818, 819], [2, 825, 842], [2, 868, 898], [2, 961, 980], [2, 985, 1014], [2, 1366, 1371], [2, 1404, 1408], [2, 1441, 1479], [2, 2222, 2227], [2, 2240, 2281], [2, 2304, 2325], [2, 2342, 2358], [2, 3097, 3135], [2, 3142, 3143], [2, 3148, 3163], [2, 3374, 3405], [2, 3430, 3440], [2, 3456, 3459], [2, 3471, 3493], [2, 3499, 3502], [2, 3502, 3503], [2, 3513, 3527], [2, 3528, 3575], [2, 3581, 3582], [2, 3588, 3601], [2, 3608, 3609]], "underlines": [[2, 257, 315], [2, 403, 459], [2, 465, 466], [2, 807, 812], [2, 818, 819], [2, 825, 842], [2, 868, 898], [2, 961, 980], [2, 985, 1014], [2, 1366, 1371], [2, 1404, 1408], [2, 1441, 1479], [2, 2222, 2227], [2, 2240, 2281], [2, 2304, 2325], [2, 2342, 2358], [2, 3097, 3135], [2, 3142, 3143], [2, 3148, 3163], [2, 3374, 3405], [2, 3430, 3440], [2, 3456, 3459], [2, 3471, 3493], [2, 3499, 3502], [2, 3502, 3503], [2, 3504, 3512], [2, 3513, 3527], [2, 3528, 3575], [2, 3575, 3580], [2, 3581, 3582], [2, 3582, 3587], [2, 3588, 3601], [2, 3601, 3607], [2, 3608, 3609], [2, 3609, 3613]], "emphasis": [[2, 257, 315], [2, 403, 459], [2, 465, 466], [2, 807, 812], [2, 818, 819], [2, 825, 842], [2, 868, 898], [2, 961, 980], [2, 985, 1014], [2, 1366, 1371], [2, 1404, 1408], [2, 1441, 1479], [2, 2222, 2227], [2, 2240, 2281], [2, 2304, 2325], [2, 2342, 2358], [2, 3097, 3135], [2, 3142, 3143], [2, 3148, 3163], [2, 3374, 3405], [2, 3430, 3440], [2, 3456, 3459], [2, 3471, 3493], [2, 3499, 3502], [2, 3513, 3527], [2, 3528, 3575], [2, 3581, 3582], [2, 3588, 3601], [2, 3608, 3609]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2016-05-24"}, {"tag": "Link \u2013 UAE", "cite": "Karam 18 Joyce Karam  [Washington Bureau Chief for Al-Hayat Newspaper], \"US-UAE counter-terrorism operations on the rise in Yemen,\" National, 3-25-2018 https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/us-uae-counter-terrorism-operations-on-the-rise-in-yemen-1.715962", "body": ["On a visit to Oman this month, US defence secretary James Mattis called US-UAE joint counter-terrorism operations against Al Qaeda in Yemen a model for American troops being present in the war-ravaged country. He then cited the battle to recapture the southern port of Mukalla, which had been held by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \"The United Arab Emirates, with some American help \u2014 intelligence help principally, had gone in, organized the local tribes to take it away and Mukalla Port fell in 36 hours after being held for a year. And so we're there to help that sort of an effort,\" Mr Mattis said. Mukalla was recaptured in April, 2016. US-UAE efforts against AQAP have since intensified, liberating Shabwa recently, Abyan, Ahwar, and other towns around Hadramawt province. Experts who spoke to The National credited military effectiveness, strategic alignment and local elements, behind the strengthened US-UAE bond in the war. For the US, Yemen\u2019s strategic importance is its geographical location \"on one of the busiest highways for international maritime trade in the entire world\", said Nicholas Heras, a senior fellow at the Centre for New American Security in Washington, where he focuses on Yemen issues. \"Whatever instability that occurs in Yemen has the potential to threaten or jam up vital global trade routes.\" The importance of Yemen to the US also lies in the recent past. \"Al Qaeda's strongest local branch is located in Yemen and has used this position to plan attacks against the US,\" Mr Heras said. The attack on the USS Cole destroyer in 2000, the attempt of shoe bomber Richard Reid on an American Airlines flight in 2001, the attack on the US embassy in Sanaa in 2008, and the foiled ink cartridges plot in 2010 are examples of Aqap's threat to American interests. While the Pentagon only admits to \"a small number\" of American troops being in Yemen, Mr Heras considers the US military to be \"deeply involved in the Yemen conflict, in ways that would surprise the American people\". \"It is not overstating it to say that Yemen is the hottest war being fought by US soldiers in the Middle East that Americans have never heard about,\" he said. Mr Mattis last week successfully urged Congress to block a bill that would have required any American forces not involved in fighting Al Qaeda in Yemen to leave the country within 30 days. But when it comes to fighting Aqap and ISIL in Yemen, the level of US-UAE co-operation is now so close that the US military \"has agreed to conduct joint kinetic operations with Emirati forces\", according to Mr Heras. That's something \"American generals only sign off on for the most competent partner militaries\", such as Nato, he said. John Arterbury, a Yemen analyst at the Navanti Group, a research and analysis company, told The National that the narrow focus of the US mission in Yemen is \"fighting Aqap and ISIL, while also pushing for a halt to the civil war and an increase in aid\" has helped its success. \"Aqap is on the back foot. UAE-backed local forces have systematically driven the group from towns and cities, and are now pursuing it into more remote areas across south Yemen,\" Mr Arterbury said, \"securing rural valleys over the past month in Hadramawt and Shabwa provinces being prime examples of this.\" The US sees the UAE as a state with capable armed forces and an abiding interest in southern Yemen, Mr Arterbury said. \"These complementary aims and abilities make the US and UAE natural partners in regards to pursuing counter-terrorism efforts in the country\u2019s south.\" On the ground \"the UAE works with tribes and other local networks, providing lucrative incentives to collaborate against Aqap\".", ""], "id": "4e9e8fcbb26fc257a0249ddf9a72a7e4e5da3024aad8d3b91e03b000edc8e1d8", "highlighted_text": "US-UAE joint counter-terrorism operations against Al Qaeda in Yemen a model The U A E with American intelligence help organized the local tribes and Mukalla Port fell in 36 hours after being held for a year efforts against A QAP have since intensified Yemen\u2019s strategic importance is its geographical location \"on one of the busiest highways for international trade Al Qaeda's strongest local branch is located in Yemen and has used this position to plan attacks against the US The USS Cole the shoe bomber attack on the US embassy and foiled ink cartridges plot are examples of Aqap's threat US military agreed to conduct joint operations with Emirati forces the narrow focus of the US mission in Yemen is \"fighting Aqap and ISIL an increase in aid\" has helped its success", "highlights": [[2, 72, 139], [2, 140, 147], [2, 337, 342], [2, 348, 349], [2, 353, 354], [2, 363, 367], [2, 373, 381], [2, 389, 406], [2, 433, 442], [2, 443, 459], [2, 476, 537], [2, 653, 670], [2, 670, 673], [2, 674, 696], [2, 950, 1057], [2, 1067, 1072], [2, 1397, 1480], [2, 1481, 1508], [2, 1526, 1529], [2, 1544, 1552], [2, 1572, 1575], [2, 1587, 1598], [2, 1656, 1680], [2, 1699, 1702], [2, 1707, 1733], [2, 1742, 1757], [2, 1758, 1764], [2, 1765, 1771], [2, 2472, 2483], [2, 2489, 2498], [2, 2499, 2512], [2, 2521, 2551], [2, 2807, 2863], [2, 2864, 2868], [2, 2869, 2877], [2, 2930, 2932], [2, 2933, 2960], [2, 2961, 2972]], "underlines": [[2, 72, 139], [2, 140, 147], [2, 148, 208], [2, 337, 342], [2, 348, 349], [2, 353, 354], [2, 363, 367], [2, 373, 381], [2, 382, 388], [2, 389, 406], [2, 407, 418], [2, 418, 432], [2, 433, 442], [2, 443, 459], [2, 460, 475], [2, 476, 537], [2, 646, 652], [2, 653, 670], [2, 670, 673], [2, 674, 696], [2, 696, 732], [2, 733, 738], [2, 738, 781], [2, 950, 1057], [2, 1058, 1066], [2, 1067, 1072], [2, 1073, 1094], [2, 1397, 1480], [2, 1481, 1508], [2, 1526, 1529], [2, 1530, 1543], [2, 1544, 1552], [2, 1553, 1571], [2, 1572, 1575], [2, 1576, 1586], [2, 1587, 1598], [2, 1599, 1655], [2, 1656, 1680], [2, 1681, 1698], [2, 1699, 1702], [2, 1703, 1706], [2, 1707, 1733], [2, 1734, 1741], [2, 1742, 1757], [2, 1758, 1764], [2, 1765, 1771], [2, 1772, 1793], [2, 2364, 2389], [2, 2390, 2394], [2, 2395, 2471], [2, 2472, 2483], [2, 2484, 2488], [2, 2489, 2498], [2, 2499, 2512], [2, 2521, 2551], [2, 2551, 2553], [2, 2577, 2673], [2, 2807, 2863], [2, 2864, 2868], [2, 2869, 2877], [2, 2877, 2929], [2, 2930, 2932], [2, 2933, 2960], [2, 2961, 2972], [2, 2975, 2979], [2, 2980, 3083]], "emphasis": [[2, 140, 147], [2, 389, 406], [2, 407, 418], [2, 2499, 2512], [2, 2521, 2551], [2, 2551, 2553], [2, 2933, 2960]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-25"}, {"tag": "Link \u2013 Egypt", "cite": "Soliman 18 (Mohamed, Mohamed Soliman is a Huffington Fellow at the Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, where he focuses on US strategy in the Middle East.

While the U.S. State Department has traditionally administered most foreign military aid, since the onset of the \"War on Terror\" the Defense Department has taken on increasing responsibility for military aid. And although the U.S. State Department for the most part observes a policy of \"parity\" in aid to the two countries, the Department of Defense has been less cautious in maintaining a balance. Baku has benefited in particular from two Pentagon aid programs, known as Section 1004 and Section 1206, which are subject to less Congressional oversight and less stringent public reporting requirements. Azerbaijan has gotten $8.5 million since 2005 in funding from Section 1004, which provides counternarcotics assistance, and $11.5 million from Section 1206, which provides counterterrorism aid. Armenia, by contrast, has gotten just $41,000 in Section 1004 funding and no Section 1206 money, according to data collected by the Washington advocacy group Security Assistance Monitor, which maintains a database of the various U.S. military assistance programs. Much of the money for Azerbaijan has been targeted toward naval forces, to reduce the risk that it could be used against Armenia (which is landlocked) and because of the U.S.'s interest in protecting Caspian energy infrastructure. The U.S. forces has focused particularly on Azerbaijan's 641st Special Warfare Naval Unit with a curriculum that has included \"Diving and Floating Mine Response.\" But not all of the training went to naval forces. In 2013, U.S. special forces soldiers conducted two month-long counternarcotics training programs for 50 members of Azerbaijan's Ministry of National Security counterterrorism unit, at a cost of $916,000. (It's not clear whether the same 50 troops were trained in both programs, or whether it was a new group of soldiers in the second training.) Two years later, that unit would be disbanded along with the entire ministry as part of an internal power struggle that also sent many senior officials to prison. And State Department programs can also benefit soldiers both from Armenia and Azerbaijan who may end up fighting one another. One senior Azerbaijani special forces commander who was killed in the April violence between the two countries known as the \"four-day war,\" Vugar Yusifov, took part in an army intelligence course (run through the State Department) in 2007 at Ft. Huachuca, in Arizona, according to Azerbaijani news reports. According to State Department records, just one Azerbaijani officer took such a course in 2007, which lasted five months and which cost the U.S. $23,582. (Credit goes to journalist/analyst Emil Sanamyan for catching Yusifov's U.S. connection.) Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have taken part in training in Romania by the U.S. Marine Corps Black Sea Rotational Force where the curriculum includes training ground forces in \"close-quarters, combat marksmanship to build proficiency and develop interoperability in counterinsurgency\" and \"close quarters combat, marksmanship skills and designated marksmanship training.\" U.S. policy has been to attempt to be even-handed by restricting aid to Armenia equally. The Departments of State and Defense, in their annual report on military aid to Congress in 2008, wrote that \"Section 907 previously prohibited most U.S. assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan and as part of a policy of even-handedness, the previous Administration extended this prohibition to security assistance to Armenia.\" But the Pentagon aid programs clearly throw off that balance in Azerbaijan's favor. Although the $20 million that Azerbaijan has gotten is small even by regional standards -- Kyrgyzstan, for example, has gotten $118 million from the same programs over the same period -- it does represent a substantial portion of what might be the U.S.'s \"hard\" military aid (like weapons and training, as opposed to \"softer\" programs like counterproliferation and English-language courses). Aid to Armenia and Azerbaijan from the primary State Department \"hard\" aid program, Foreign Military Financing, has declined steadily over the last ten years but has tended to range between $2 and $4 million per year -- and to be allocated in identical amounts to both countries. Last month's flareup in fighting between the two countries over the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh -- the worst violence since a ceasfire was signed in 1994 -- has revived debate about U.S. military aid in the region. U.S. law, in particular another \"Section\" -- 907 -- has restricted U.S. aid to Azerbaijan since 1992, but since 2001 those restrictions have been waived every year. The most recent waiver was issued April 21, when the State Department affirmed that U.S. aid to Azerbaijan: Is necessary to support United States efforts to counter international terrorism; Is necessary to support the operational readiness of United States Armed Forces or coalition partners to counter international terrorism; Is important to Azerbaijan's border security; and Will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia.", ""], "id": "32e162710a20e0b965bd97399ed425028b44708565cca7d19f7db868e6f4a056", "highlighted_text": "Azerbaijan has gotten $20 million in military aid from the D o D $11.5 million provides counterterrorism aid Azerbaijan have taken part in training by the U.S. Marine Corps to develop interoperability in counterinsurgency the $20 million represent a substantial portion of weapons and training aid to Azerbaijan Is necessary to counter international terrorism Is n ecessary to support readiness of U S Armed Forces or coalition partners to counter international terrorism", "highlights": [[2, 0, 58], [2, 64, 65], [2, 75, 76], [2, 78, 79], [2, 926, 939], [2, 965, 973], [2, 974, 994], [2, 2907, 2945], [2, 2957, 2981], [2, 3102, 3104], [2, 3127, 3172], [2, 3774, 3789], [2, 3960, 3994], [2, 4046, 4066], [2, 4917, 4934], [2, 4936, 4951], [2, 4985, 5016], [2, 5018, 5022], [2, 5022, 5041], [2, 5058, 5072], [2, 5078, 5079], [2, 5085, 5122], [2, 5123, 5154]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 58], [2, 64, 65], [2, 75, 76], [2, 78, 79], [2, 802, 823], [2, 926, 939], [2, 959, 964], [2, 965, 973], [2, 974, 994], [2, 994, 995], [2, 1713, 1801], [2, 2890, 2906], [2, 2907, 2945], [2, 2946, 2956], [2, 2957, 2981], [2, 2982, 3101], [2, 3102, 3104], [2, 3105, 3126], [2, 3127, 3172], [2, 3774, 3789], [2, 3790, 3816], [2, 3955, 3959], [2, 3960, 3994], [2, 3995, 4045], [2, 4046, 4066], [2, 4877, 4916], [2, 4917, 4934], [2, 4936, 4951], [2, 4952, 4984], [2, 4985, 5016], [2, 5016, 5017], [2, 5018, 5022], [2, 5022, 5041], [2, 5042, 5057], [2, 5058, 5072], [2, 5072, 5077], [2, 5078, 5079], [2, 5079, 5084], [2, 5085, 5122], [2, 5123, 5154], [2, 5154, 5155]], "emphasis": [[2, 974, 994], [2, 994, 995], [2, 3127, 3172], [2, 4985, 5016], [2, 5016, 5017], [2, 5018, 5022], [2, 5123, 5154], [2, 5154, 5155]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2016-05-17"}, {"tag": "That snowballs - ending US support even if it is only in border security results in less cooperation", "cite": "Ramani 16 Samuel Ramani, St. Anthony\u2019s College, University of Oxford (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/20/3-reasons-the-u-s-wont-break-with-azerbaijan-over-its-violations-of-human-rights-and-democratic-freedoms/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a0dfc85ec4bb)  ", "body": ["Azerbaijan works with the West against terrorism.

The war may be over soon, but peace is by no means assured in Afghanistan. There are real short and long-term risks of a resumption of civil war. Other international experience and Afghanistan\u2019s own history suggest that the Taliban will be difficult to eradicate as a fighting force and political influence. Indeed, as we currently see in Afghanistan, many Taliban leaders and rank and file fighters have simply switched sides, reverting to their former \u201cAfghan\u201d rather than \u201cTalib\u201d identities. They have not necessarily shed their beliefs or commitment to a religiously based rather than secular society. Irrespective of the present agreements on the structure of a new government, support for a new project of state building will be thinly rooted and fragile. There will be little tolerance for inevitable mistakes unless there is some appreciable and immediate improvement in the lives of the general population. In addition, many former Mujaheddin fighters and leaders linked with the Northern Alliance have been left out of the new interim government recently formed in Bonn. Some of these leaders, such as General Abdur Rashid Dostum, and former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, have considerable support in Central Asia. Uzbekistan has served as Dostum\u2019s patron, while Russia has supported Rabbani and other ethnic Tajik leaders, using Tajikistan as a base for contacts. Neither is likely to withdraw this support in the immediate future, thus bolstering their proxies in opposition to the new government and contributing to the fracturing of Afghan politics. This could be particularly difficult in the case of Dostum, who has been restored to power in his former regional stronghold in Mazar-e-Sharif near the border with Uzbekistan. If Dostum\u2019s past conduct is anything to judge by, he will likely govern Mazar-e-Sharif as his personal fiefdom, forging ties with Tashkent rather than Kabul, and encouraging the continued fragmentation rather than consolidation of the Afghan state. If stability is to be ensured in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Russia and other Central Asian actors will have to relinquish their ties to these old leaders and give their full support to the new government in Kabul. The third priority\u2014and closely linked to the second\u2014is \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d that has produced and supported radical militant groups in Central and South Asia. This is fostered by weak central government and the disintegration of state institutions, a collapsed economy, crushing poverty and the absence of a social safety net, high birthrates, high unemployment, poor and inadequate education, widespread illiteracy, the erosion of traditional social institutions and the infiltration of radical ideologies, free flows of drugs and illicit weapons, and isolation from all but the most immediate of neighbors. The Central Asian states, particularly Tajikistan, have many of the same elements that Afghanistan possessed in facilitating the rise of the Taliban and ultimately becoming a haven to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Without an approach to the reconstruction and development of the region that encompasses Central Asia as well as Afghanistan, we may simply see the shift of the current problems from the south to the north, and the emergence of Taliban and Al Qaeda-like movements in Central Asia itself.

But that dream turned into a nightmare July 29, when, in a deliberate act, a dark sedan smashed through the group. The men inside got out and attacked the cyclists with knives. Four of the tourists \u2014 an American couple, a Swiss citizen and a Dutch national \u2014 were killed; the others \u2014 one Swiss, one Dutch and one French \u2014 were injured. On July 30, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault through its Amaq news service. In a statement, it said the attackers \"were soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the attack in response to calls to target the citizens of the coalition countries.\" On July 31, Amaq released a video that it claimed featured the five young Tajik attackers claiming allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Although the video made no specific mention of the bicyclists, the youths denounced the Tajik government, said the country was \"occupied by unbelievers\" and made vows to attack. Tajik authorities played down the Islamic State claim and blamed the attack on the exiled Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan. Authorities say they have found the damaged vehicle and have arrested or killed several suspects. However, the poorly planned and executed attack appears to be the work of grassroots jihadists, and not trained operatives. While Tajikistan appears to be stable on the surface, underlying tensions that are held together by suppression by the government under President Emomali Rakhmon could rupture. However, like the rest of Central Asia, Tajikistan is a country in transition, and it will be important to keep a close eye on jihadism and the threat it poses to the country's shaky peace. Outside their country, Tajiks have been active participants in jihadist struggles and suicide bombings. Tajik officials say that about 1,400 of their citizens have traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with the Islamic State. And research from the International Center for Counterterrorism at The Hague for 2015-16, indicated that Tajik involvement in suicide bombings was disproportionately high when compared with other nationalities. Tajik jihadists have joined Islamic State's Wilayat Khorasan in Afghanistan and have taken part in suicide bombings in Kabul. They have also been involved in plotting terrorist attacks in Russia and Europe. Despite all this, terrorist acts, especially those directed against foreigners, are relatively rare inside Tajikistan. Indeed, despite its shared border with Afghanistan, the low amount of terrorist activity inside the country has led Stratfor to rate the country as only a medium threat for terrorism. However, Tajikistan remains a fragile and vulnerable state. It is a poor country in a bad neighborhood awash with weaponry and radical ideologies. Of the former Soviet states, it has the lowest per-capita gross domestic product and the highest percentage of people living in poverty. Many Tajiks travel to Russia or elsewhere abroad to find work, and remittances account for over 30 percent of GDP. Drug smuggling is also a significant part of the economy. Tajiks are heavily involved in processing Afghan opium gum into heroin and in smuggling Afghan heroin into Russia and Europe \u2014 often working with the Afghan Taliban to do so. On top of this, the country's growing population is skewed heavily toward youth \u2014 over half of its people are younger than 25. A map shows the location of Tajikistan in Central Asia. Autocratic President Emomali Rakhmon, who has ruled the country since 1992, has suppressed opposition since the brutal civil war ended in 1997, but significant regional, clan and religious divisions remain. Rakhmon has imposed a degree of stability by applying pressure to keep those divisions from splitting open. But his ability to do so indefinitely remains in doubt. The government's heavy-handed approach to stifling opposition and religious activity has created a strong sense of resentment among certain segments of the population. Many Tajiks, as well as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), have joined the Khorasan Province, the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State. Meanwhile, the power of the Taliban in Afghanistan is growing. These developments raise concerns about the possibility that militants could take root in Tajikistan, developing into a threat to the government. So, was the July 29 attack a sign of a growing movement? The answer lies in looking closely at the assault itself. The tactics in the assault seem to be consistent with those typically used by grassroot jihadists. Evidence that it was a grassroots effort can also be seen in the wording for the Islamic State's claim for the attack, which said the men were soldiers who had responded to its call. This language is typically used for jihadists inspired by the Islamic State or directed by its members through online forums. The language it uses for operatives from franchise groups or for members sent out to conduct attacks, such as the cell responsible for the Paris and Brussels attacks, is different. In addition, the assault itself had not been planned or executed well. It's hard to imagine a more vulnerable target than a group of bicyclists on a rural stretch of highway. Yet, the attack succeeded in killing only four of them. Furthermore, it was carried out before an array of witnesses, including one who recorded it on a cellphone video. The method of attack, a vehicular assault followed by an armed attack, corresponds exactly to tactics that the Islamic State has encouraged its grassroots supporters to employ. Similar assaults have taken place in London and in Barcelona. The choice to carry out this type of attack in the United Kingdom or Spain, where it is somewhat difficult to get firearms, makes logical sense. But weapons are much easier to obtain in Tajikistan, especially for any professional operative with connections to either the Islamic State or the Taliban. Finally, the assault doesn't reflect the capabilities of trained operatives. Many of the Taliban's older operational leaders have been at war since 1979, and the younger ones have known warfare all their lives. They have survived 17 years of combat with U.S. and NATO troops, probably the best trained and equipped forces on the planet. That combat experience has honed the Taliban's military capabilities, including a sophisticated ability to carry out armed assaults and ambushes. They have also become quite adept at terrorist attacks, including assassinations. The Taliban and Islamic State militants in the region are capable killers and would be able to plan a much more effective attack against a group of foreign cyclists, choosing a moment of greater vulnerability, such as when they were asleep in their tents, to strike. Within Tajikistan, jihadist activity has remained weak for several reasons. First, the Taliban remain focused on Afghanistan and do not have a larger regional agenda. Second, the Tajik government has created a pervasive security apparatus that aggressively pursues any perceived opposition, including religious extremism. Thousands of Russian troops stationed at the 201st military base back up those domestic security forces. Third, Tajikistan's long secular communist tradition also means that jihadism does not hold the same widespread appeal that it does in Afghanistan. These factors make Tajikistan a hostile operating environment for jihadists, especially those operating in formal hierarchical groups. In many ways, this has created an operational environment similar to those seen in Europe or North America \u2014 where grassroots terrorists working alone or in small cells are better able to avoid the government's attention than professional cadres linked to groups. In some ways, Tajikistan resembles Libya under Moammar Gadhafi. The strongman was able to suppress dissent, including that by jihadists, and to keep regional and tribal fractures in check through the use of force. Once Gadhafi's control slipped, the country spiraled into civil war. Like Libya, Tajikistan is quite brittle. Government oppression, combined with a young and impoverished population, could eventually result in an increase in jihadist adherents inside the country. And if Tajikistan were to fracture, it could open up another space for extremists to operate in Central Asia.", ""], "id": "74f92afb4940b9c9f318b37649ff7ca808ed08634a23f3479792c0eb55bf3530", "highlighted_text": ", Tajiks have been active participants in jihadist struggles and suicide bombings about 1,400 of their citizens fight with the I S Tajik involvement in suicide bombings was disproportionately high They have also been involved in plotting terrorist attacks in Russia and Europe.

From March 27 to April 7, about 100 Tajik and 150 US troops participated in drills that took place at various locations in Tajikistan. Military co-operation with the US is key for Tajikistan, said Saifullo Safarov, first deputy director of the Strategic Research Centre under the President of Tajikistan. \"The US is helping Tajikistan in its fight against international terrorism, especially in Afghanistan,\" Safarov told Caravanserai. \"Threats that come out of Afghanistan are also threats to the US. That's why we need to co-ordinate against the Afghan [threat].\" \"We are unable to ensure our security without US co-operation,\" he added. The US is committed to help Tajikistan because both are members of the C5+1, a consortium of the US and the five Central Asian states that addresses challenges like terrorism, Dushanbe-based security analyst Abdumannon Azizov told Cararavanserai. \"Tajikistan has designated the fight against terrorism ... as a priority,\" said Azizov, noting that radicalisation of migrant workers and the build-up of Central Asian insurgents in Afghanistan near the Tajik border \"are influencing the situation\". US trainers can bring Tajik military units up to US standards, he said. Equipment is another avenue of potential US aid, he said. \"All of our military equipment is Soviet made,\" he said. \"Given the situation in northern Afghan provinces, it would be beneficial if the US could ... provide military and technical support for border guards,\" he said. Benefits of cooperation Placed in a dangerous neighbourhood, Tajikistan needs all the help it can get, say observers. Tajikistan co-operates with all countries to fight terrorism, Abdulkhalim Gafforov, an MP affiliated with the Socialist Party, told Caravanserai. \"We should take advantage of all opportunities [to co-operate],\" he said. \"Such co-operation is in the interests of security and national stability.\" The US has provided more than $260 million (1.7 billion TJS) in security assistance in 25 years of full relations, Dushanbe-based regional security analyst Abdulmalik Kodirov told Caravanserai. Tajikistan used those funds to build border check-points, transport and electrical systems and training grounds, as well as to conduct military training inside and outside the country, he said. \"Most of the money the US sends goes to preventing threats from Afghanistan,\" said Kodirov. \"We also run programmes to fight drug trafficking. Tajikistan can't fight these threats alone.\" He urged more Tajiks in the security sector to learn English. \"That will increase the number of Tajik experts who undergo counter-terrorism training in the US,\" he said. Tajikistan chooses to have an open-door policy, which makes international co-operation necessary for its security, said Shokirjon Khakimov, deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party. \"There's no doubt that military co-operation, joint training sessions and joint projects will help us fight trans-national terrorism,\" he told Caravanserai. \"We'll also be able to contribute to fighting international terrorism.\" Strengthening relations The recent training consisted of previously agreed-upon scenarios, a Tajik security official who requested anonymity told Caravanserai. \"Tajik soldiers worked with their American colleagues to develop counter-terrorism tactics,\" said the source. \"They learned how to fight in close quarters with terrorists.\" Co-operation with the US has been growing, remarked the source. One sign of that tightening bond was the exchange of telegrammes between the countries' presidents in February to mark the 25th anniversary of their diplomatic relations, he added. US President Donald Trump wrote of the countries' \"common goals of regional security and stability\" in his message, while Tajik President Emomali Rahmon cited his \"optimism\" about the course of future relations.

Rogue states led by sociopaths and religious zealots continually threaten the peace and global stability, while free nations, led by the United States, continue to dither. For some reason, we have trouble putting it all together. It's nearly impossible to believe Pyongyang developed its nuclear capabilities and missile program all by itself. It had to have help, mostly likely from other regimes whose stated objective is to destroy the United States. Yet policymakers and military planners within the Pentagon continue to employ the same kinds of conventional responses while indicating they are unwilling to back up any tough talk they can muster with force if necessary. Given the 17-year presence in Afghanistan, as well as the continuing commitment to Iraq, that's understandable \u2013 but also potentially fatal. New dangers arise every day that America is ill-equipped to face, while few have the courage to propose new ways to fight the next war. The biggest threat of all comes from the so-called radical Islamic terror groups that use \u2013 abuse, really \u2013 the religious beliefs of the poor and disenfranchised throughout North Africa and the Gulf region to recruit allies to their cause. They're engaged in a holy war that justifies any tactic in the pursuit of victory. The use of nuclear weapons, as far as they are concerned, is not off the table. America's efforts to prevent this, as symbolized by the deal the Obama administration and assorted European powers made with Iran, have been at best half-hearted in attempts to prevent it. How we respond to this threat may determine our future as well as the world's. Meanwhile, the problem gets worse. At the beginning of August, Yusuf-Garaad Omar, the Somali minister of foreign affairs, wrote U.S. Ambassador Stephen Schwartz of the dangers posed by the newly-reconstituted al-Shabaab terror group which, Omar wrote, has now \"captured critical surface exposed uranium deposits in the Galmudug region and are strip mining triuranium octoxide for transport to Iran.\" In an accompanying intelligence brief, the Somalis indicated these materials could be extracted \"fairly quickly, without the use of advanced mining equipment\" and, because of its inherent stability, can easily be shipped \"to Iran, and then on to Iran's suspected customers, notably North Korea.\" \"The potential for nuclear proliferation is real, immediate, and pressing,\" the analysis said, putting the need to stop it squarely within the zone defining the boundaries of the United States' national security interests. \"Only the United States has the capacity to identify and smash al-Shabaab elements operating within our country,\" Omar wrote Schwartz. \"The time for surgical strikes and limited engagement has passed, as Somalia's problems have metastasized into the World's problems. Every day that passes without intervention provides America's enemies with additional material for nuclear weapons.\" He's not wrong, but clearly the sentiment for doing anything about it does not yet exist in Washington. America was burned badly during its previous intervention in Somalia. The situation on the ground is little improved despite the election of a pro-U.S. president in 2017 and no one is eager to jump a second time into the same fire. The danger of Somali uranium falling into the hands of Iran or North Korea changes the calculation. The U.S. must step up its activities \u2013 diplomatic, economic and military \u2013 in order to curtail the shipments the diplomatic message indicates are ongoing. This may not require a significant military presence, as has been requested, but may require taking the issue to the United Nations, the formal recognition that Iran may be in violation of the anti-proliferation agreement it just made, and the use of blockades and other interventions to seize materials in the pipeline between Africa and the Gulf. No one can now say we have not been warned. Something must be done, even if not at the level of what the Somalis have apparently asked for. The global terror threat is highly mobile. The United States must develop new strategies to deal with what amounts to a multi-front war where the opposition works in an integrated fashion that prevents traditional tactics from being successful. Somalia is but one piece of a very complex puzzle the enemies of America must never be allowed to fully assemble.", ""], "id": "be0a9c027878a35f25d52e64e892776f1ebf361ad3b87f25e89279879de88468", "highlighted_text": "the world is an unstable place .

So far, 2018 looks on track to be lower still. The university\u2019s Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) program found there were 10,900 terrorist attacks around the world last year, which killed a total of 26,400 people, including perpetrators. That was a drop from 2016, which was in turn a drop from 2015. Right now, the number of terrorist attacks and deaths from terrorism appears to have peaked in 2014, when there were nearly 17,000 attacks and more than 45,000 victims. What explains the downward trend? In Western Europe, where the number of attacks increased slightly in 2017 \u2014 but the number of victims dropped by 65 percent \u2014 it may be matters of policing and counterintelligence. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the country had foiled 13 Islamist terrorism plots and four far-right plots since March 2017, when last year\u2019s attack near the Houses of Parliament occurred. On a global scale, however, the answer is clear. Though there was a surge in terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, most attacks still occur in the Middle East and Africa, and those regions saw a big decline in 2017.

This has always been true: when bronze implements supplanted those made of stone, the ancient world got scythes and awls, but also swords and battle-axes. The novelty of our present situation is that modern technology can provide small groups of people with much greater lethality than ever before. We now have to worry that private parties might gain access to weapons that are as destructive as\u2014or possibly even more destructive than\u2014 those held by any nation-state. A handful of people, perhaps even a single individual, could have the ability to kill millions or even billions. Indeed, it is possible, from a technological standpoint, to kill every man, woman, and child on earth. The gravity of the situation is so extreme that getting the concept across without seeming silly or alarmist is challenging. Just thinking about the subject with any degree of seriousness numbs the mind. The goal of this essay is to present the case for making the needed changes before such a catastrophe occurs. The issues described here are too important to ignore. Failing nation-states\u2014like North Korea\u2014which possess nuclear weapons potentially pose a nuclear threat. Each new entrant to the nuclear club increases the possibility this will happen, but this problem is an old one, and one that existing diplomatic and military structures aim to manage. The newer and less understood danger arises from the increasing likelihood that stateless groups, bent on terrorism, will gain access to nuclear weapons, most likely by theft from a nation-state. Should this happen, the danger we now perceive to be coming from rogue states will pale in comparison. The ultimate response to a nuclear attack is a nuclear counterattack. Nation states have an address, and they know that we will retaliate in kind. Stateless groups are much more difficult to find which makes a nuclear counterattack virtually impossible. As a result, they can strike without fear of overwhelming retaliation, and thus they wield much more effective destructive power. Indeed, in many cases the fundamental equation of retaliation has become reversed. Terrorists often hope to provoke reprisal attacks on their own people, swaying popular opinion in their favor. The aftermath of 9/11 is a case in point. While it seems likely that Osama bin Laden and his henchmen hoped for a massive overreaction from the United States, it is unlikely his Taliban hosts anticipated the U.S. would go so far as to invade Afghanistan. Yes, al-Qaeda lost its host state and some personnel. The damage slowed the organization down but did not destroy it. Instead, the stateless al-Qaeda survived and adapted. The United States can claim some success against al-Qaeda in the years since 9/11, but it has hardly delivered a deathblow. Eventually, the world will recognize that stateless groups are more powerful than nation-states because terrorists can wield weapons and mount assaults that no nationstate would dare to attempt. So far, they have limited themselves to dramatic tactical terrorism: events such as 9/11, the butchering of Russian schoolchildren, decapitations broadcast over the internet, and bombings in major cities. Strategic objectives cannot be far behind.

Indeed, in an age of transnational terrorism and unprecedented dissemination of dual-use nuclear technology, ignoring nuclear terrorism threat is an imprudent policy choice. The incapability of terrorist organizations to engineer fissile material does not eliminate completely the possibility of nuclear terrorism. At the same time, the absence of an example or precedent of a nuclear/ radiological terrorism does not qualify the assertion that the nuclear/radiological terrorism ought to be remained a myth. Farsighted rationality obligates that one should not miscalculate transnational terrorist groups \u2014 whose behavior suggests that they have a death wish \u2014 of acquiring nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological material producing capabilities. In addition, one could be sensible about the published information that huge amount of nuclear material is spread around the globe. According to estimate it is enough to build more than 120,000 Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs (Fissile Material Working Group, 2010, April 1). The alarming fact is that a few storage sites of nuclear/radiological materials are inadequately secured and continue to be accumulated in unstable regions (Sambaiew, 2010, February). Attempts at stealing fissile material had already been discovered (Din & Zhiwei, 2003: 18). \u00b6 Numerous evidences confirm that terrorist groups had aspired to acquire fissile material for their terrorist acts. Late Osama bin Laden, the founder of al Qaeda stated that acquiring nuclear weapons was a \u201creligious duty\u201d (Yusufzai, 1999, January 11). The IAEA also reported that \u201cal-Qaeda was actively seeking an atomic bomb.\u201d Jamal Ahmad al-Fadl, a dissenter of Al Qaeda, in his trial testimony had \u201crevealed his extensive but unsuccessful efforts to acquire enriched uranium for al-Qaeda\u201d (Allison, 2010, January: 11). On November 9, 2001, Osama bin Laden claimed that \u201cwe have chemical and nuclear weapons as a deterrent and if America used them against us we reserve the right to use them (Mir, 2001, November 10).\u201d On May 28, 2010, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a Pakistani nuclear scientist confessed that he met Osama bin Laden. He claimed that \u201cI met Osama bin Laden before 9/11 not to give him nuclear know-how, but to seek funds for establishing a technical college in Kabul (Syed, 2010, May 29).\u201d He was arrested in 2003 and after extensive interrogation by American and Pakistani intelligence agencies he was released (Syed, 2010, May 29). Agreed, Mr. Mahmood did not share nuclear know-how with Al Qaeda, but his meeting with Osama establishes the fact that the terrorist organization was in contact with nuclear scientists. Second, the terrorist group has sympathizers in the nuclear scientific bureaucracies. It also authenticates bin Laden\u2019s Deputy Ayman Zawahiri\u2019s claim which he made in December 2001: \u201cIf you have $30 million, go to the black market in the central Asia, contact any disgruntled Soviet scientist and a lot of dozens of smart briefcase bombs are available (Allison, 2010, January: 2).\u201d \u00b6 The covert meetings between nuclear scientists and al Qaeda members could not be interpreted as idle threats and thereby the threat of nuclear/radiological terrorism is real. The Defense Secretary Robert Gates admitted in 2008 that \u201cwhat keeps every senior government leader awake at night is the thought of a terrorist ending up with a weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear (Mueller, 2011, August 2).\u201d Indeed, the nuclear deterrence strategy cannot deter the transnational terrorist syndicate from nuclear/radiological terrorist attacks. Daniel Whiteneck pointed out:\u00b6 \u201cEvidence suggests, for example, that al Qaeda might not only use WMD simply to demonstrate the magnitude of its capability but that it might actually welcome the escalation of a strong U.S. response, especially if it included catalytic effects on governments and societies in the Muslim world. An adversary that prefers escalation regardless of the consequences cannot be deterred\u201d (Whiteneck, 2005, Summer: 187)\u00b6 Since taking office, President Obama has been reiterating that \u201cnuclear weapons represent the \u2018gravest threat\u2019 to United States and international security.\u201d While realizing that the US could not prevent nuclear/radiological terrorist attacks singlehandedly, he launched 47an international campaign to convince the international community about the increasing threat of nuclear/ radiological terrorism. He stated on April 5, 2009: \u201cBlack market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold (Remarks by President Barack Obama, 2009, April 5).\u201d He added: \u201cOne terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe\u201d (Remarks by President Barack Obama, 2009, April 5).

Rather, death in itself is an evil to us because it ontologically destroys the current existent subject \u2014 it is the ultimate in metaphysical lightening strikes.80 The evil of death is truly an ontological evil borne by the person who already exists, independently of calculations about better or worse possible lives. Such an evil need not be consciously experienced in order to be an evil for the kind of being a human person is. Death is an evil because of the change in kind it brings about, a change that is destructive of the type of entity that we essentially are. Anything, whether caused naturally or caused by human intervention (intentional or unintentional) that drastically interferes in the process of maintaining the person in existence is an objective evil for the person. What is crucially at stake here, and is dialectically supportive of the self-evidency of the basic good of human life, is that death is a radical interference with the current life process of the kind of being that we are. In consequence, death itself can be credibly thought of as a \u2018primitive evil\u2019 for all persons, regardless of the extent to which they are currently or prospectively capable of participating in a full array of the goods of life.81  In conclusion, concerning willed human actions, it is justifiable to state that any intentional rejection of human life itself cannot therefore be warranted since it is an expression of an ultimate disvalue for the subject, namely, the destruction of the present person; a radical ontological good that we cannot begin to weigh objectively against the travails of life in a rational manner. To deal with the sources of disvalue (pain, suffering, etc.) we should not seek to irrationally destroy the person, the very source and condition of all human possibility.82 "], "id": "f1610b61cd8aedf7ad73d4bc3fc5013c2a68996f37cb04e9275e3896c1f093f2", "highlighted_text": "death is evil not because it deprives us of a future Rather, death in itself is evil because it ontologically destroys the subject independently of calculations about better or worse possible lives.

This is why, from the standpoint of politics\u2014as opposed to religion\u2014pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with \u201cgood\u201d may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of \u201cgood\u201d that generates evil.

It might seem obvious that human extinction would be a very bad thing, both because of the loss of potential future lives, and because of the loss of the scientific and artistic progress that we would make in the future. But the issue is at least unclear. The continuation of the human race would be a mixed bag: inevitably, it would involve both upsides and downsides. And if one regards it as much more important to avoid bad things happening than to promote good things happening then one could plausibly regard human extinction as a good thing.For example, one might regard the prevention of bads as being in general more important that the promotion of goods, as defended historically by G. E. Moore,185 and more recently by Thomas Hurka.186 One could weight the prevention of suffering as being much more important that the promotion of happiness. Or one could weight the prevention of objective bads, such as war and genocide, as being much more important than the promotion of objective goods, such as scientific and artistic progress. If the human race continues its future will inevitably involve suffering as well as happiness, and objective bads as well as objective goods. So, if one weights the bads sufficiently heavily against the goods, or if one is sufficiently pessimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to achieve good outcomes, then one will regard human extinction as a good thing.187 However, even if we believe in a moral view according to which human extinction would be a good thing, we still have strong reason to prevent near-term human extinction. To see this, we must note three points. First, we should note that the extinction of the human race is an extremely high stakes moral issue. Humanity could be around for a very long time: if humans survive as long as the median mammal species, we will last another two million years. On this estimate, the number of humans in existence in the The future, given that we don\u2019t go extinct any time soon, would be [over 20 quadrillion]. So if it is good to bring new people into existence, then it\u2019s very good to prevent human extinction. Second, human extinction is by its nature an irreversible scenario. If we continue to exist, then we always have the option of letting ourselves go extinct in the future (or, perhaps more realistically, of considerably reducing population size). But if we go extinct, then we can\u2019t magically bring ourselves back into existence at a later date. Third, we should expect ourselves to progress, morally, over the next few centuries, as we have progressed in the past. So we should expect that in a few centuries\u2019 time we will have better evidence about how to evaluate human extinction than we currently have. Given these three factors, it would be better to prevent the near-term extinction of the human race, even if we thought that the extinction of the human race would actually be a very good thing. To make this concrete, I\u2019ll give the following simple but illustrative model. Suppose that we have 0.8 credence that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 0.2 certain that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people; and the degree to which it is good to produce new people, if it is good, is the same as the degree to which it is bad to produce new people, if it is bad. That is, I\u2019m supposing, for simplicity, that we know that one new life has one unit of value; we just don\u2019t know whether that unit is positive or negative. And let\u2019s use our estimate of 2\u00d710^14 people who would exist in the future, if we avoid near-term human extinction. Given our stipulated credences, the expected benefit of letting the human race go extinct now would be (.8-.2)\u00d7(2\u00d710^14) = 1.2\u00d7(10^14). Suppose that, if we let the human race continue and did research for 300 years, we would know for certain whether or not additional people are of positive or negative value. If so, then with the credences above we should think it 80% likely that we will find out that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 20% likely that we will find out that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people. So there\u2019s an 80% chance of a loss of 3\u00d7(10^10) (because of the delay of letting the human race go extinct), the expected value of which is 2.4\u00d7(10^10).

First, it accomplished the complete demonization of other nations and national groups. Initially, state-controlled propaganda machines broadcast stories of the \u201cother\u2019s\u201d inhumanity. Overtime many witnesses and victims of acts of great cruelty began to tell their story \u2013 and their neighbours listened. Second, war hastened physical national segregation. People who had been forced to leave their villages and cities because of their national background now crowded into new cities, creating new enclaves of \u201ctheir own people.\u201d Segregation exploited and reinforced otherness. Finally, war closed the ranks. People throughout the former Yugoslavia were forced to decide who they were among three narrow choices: Serb, Croat, or Muslim. This left four categories of people without an identity: those of mixed parentage or marriage; those who were of another national identity, such as Albanian or Hungarian; those who wanted to identify themselves as something else, either above the nation, such as European, or below the nation, such as a member of a particular neighbourhood or organisation; and those who wanted out of the labelling process altogether. Those who failed to make a choice usually left the country (if they could) or fell silent; a few stubbornly fought back, despite the extreme backlash against anything different and potentially challenging to the nation. II. Characteristics of Conflicts with Racial Dimension: Roles of Racism The above discussion demonstrates a primary characteristic of conflicts with a racial dimension. Political mobilisation linked to real and imagined group differences arises where the state\u2019s administrative structures and legal institutions distribute scarce resources based on ethnic/national differences. The problem is particularly acute where, as in Rwanda and Yugoslavia, lead positions in military and police forces are distributed based on group identity.20 Yugoslavia and Rwanda are textbook examples of cases in which the controlling entity (the state, the party, the colonial entity) \u201cfor its own administrative convenience and in order to improve control over local \u00e9lites, may select certain ethnic \u00e9lites and organisations as collaborators or channels for the transmission of 7 government patronage.\u201d21 This favouritism based on group identity serves to polarise societies and, additionally, to institutionalise and make acceptable intra-group suspicion and hatred. In Rwanda and Kosovo, polarisation and racism played a role, not as the root cause of conflict, but as a tool of \u00e9lites. In both Rwanda and Kosovo, many of those who participated in the propaganda inciting racism, were intellectuals.22 It is characteristic of conflicts with a racist dimension that \u00e9lites have the ability to manipulate racism because of other conditions in-country, such as: structural poverty, unmet human development needs, comparative deprivation of one group to another, media manipulation of misunderstandings among the general populace, and the absence of human rights, the rule of law and civil and political institutions encouraging citizen participation. Where a group perceives a threat to its interests and values, rising counter-\u00e9lites find playing the racist/nationalist/ chauvinist card a particularly useful tool to assert a right to rule to protect the \u201ctrue\u201d national or ethnic interest. In Rwanda and Kosovo, extremist \u00e9lites played upon the deep fears and frustrations of the populace.

Consider the fact that in 1925-1926, there were two college policy topics, one for men and one for women. Men got to debate child labor laws, and women had to debate divorce law. On the truth-testing view, the women debating the women\u2019s topic would be barred from discussing the inherent sexism of the topic choice and the division of topics to begin with. Or consider the retracted 2010 November Public Forum topic, \u201cResolved: An Islamic cultural center should be built near Ground Zero.\u201d Many debaters would feel uncomfortable arguing that resolution, just like they did on the 2012 January/February LD topic about domestic violence. We both know individuals who felt the domestic violence topic was so triggering that they did not want to compete at all. We can draw two conclusions from examples like these. First, there are good reasons to not debate a particular topic. These reasons have been spelled out over decades of debate scholarship ranging from Broda-Bahm and Murphy (1994) to Varda and Cook (2007) to Vincent (2013). Second, truth-testing prevents either team from making the argument that the topic is offensive or harmful. A hypothetical case, such as a resolution including an offensive racial epithet, makes the problem more obvious. Maybe the idea behind the resolution is good, but there\u2019s something left out by analysis that stops there and ignores the use of a derogatory slur. Truth-testing makes irrelevant the words in the topic and the words used by the debaters. Thus, it fails to capture the reasons that any good person would \u201cnegate\u201d or even refuse to debate an offensive topic. Clearly, there are elements of a topical advocacy beyond its truth that are worthy of questioning. Nebel (2015) acknowledges that some past resolutions were potentially harmful to debate (1.2, para. 5). Rather than exclude affected students as \u2018not following the rules\u2019 of semantics or truth-testing, we conclude that they should not be required to debate the topic. Nebel grapples with harmful topics in the following passage: I don\u2019t think there is a magic-bullet response to critiques of the topic\u2026I think they must be answered on a case-by-case basis, in their own terms\u2026The question boils down to whether or not the topic is harmful for students to debate, and whether those harms justify breaking, or making an exception to, the topicality rule (1.2, para. 5) This statement is hard to square with Nebel\u2019s thesis that semantic interpretations of the resolution come \u201clexically prior\u201d (in other words, they always come first). He wants to allow exceptions, but doing so proves that harmfulness concerns can and do trump the topicality rule. As Nebel\u2019s struggle with the critique of topicality illustrates, every article that claims to espouse a comprehensive view of debate must allow some exceptions to comply with our intuitions. The exceptions do not prove the rule. They prove there is a high level of concern in debate for affording dignity and respect to different kinds of arguments and modes of argumentation. There is no one principle of proper debate. Once the door is open for external factors like harmfulness, the inference to the priority of pragmatics is an easy one to make. If we care about the effects of debating the resolution on the students debating it, then other values like exclusion, education, and fairness start to creep in. If we can justify avoiding discussion of a bad topic on pragmatic grounds, we can also justify promoting discussion of a good topic. Any advantage to allowing discursive kritiks, performances, and roles of the ballot further justifies this pragmatic view against truth-testing. NDT champion Elijah Smith (2013) warns that without these argument forms, we \u201cdistance the conversation from the material reality that black debaters are forced to deal with every day\u201d. Christopher Vincent (2013) built on that idea, arguing that universal moral theory \u201cdrowns out the perspectives of students of color that are historically excluded from the conversation\u201d (para. 3). While we don\u2019t agree wholesale with these authors, their work unequivocally demonstrates the value of departures from pure truth-testing. While we may not convince our opposition that they should presume value in kritik-based strategies, they should remain open to them. In a recent article for the Rostrum, Pittsburgh debate coach Paul Johnson (2015) extolled the \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach. Let the debaters test whether the arguments have merit, rather than deciding beforehand: In a debate round, one may argue the impertinence of theses about structural racism with regards to a particular case\u2026But when we explicitly or implicitly suggest such theses have little to no value by deciding in advance that they are inaccurate, we are forswearing the hard, argumentative work of subjecting our own beliefs to rigorous testing and interrogation (p. 90) Suggesting that non-topical, race-based approaches are \u201cvigilantist\u201d and \u201cself-serving\u201d \u201cadventure[s]\u201d is to demean the worth of these arguments before the debate round even starts (Nebel 2015, 1.1, para. 2). The claim that they \u2018break the rules\u2019 or exist \u2018outside the law\u2019 otherizes the debaters, coaches, and squads that pursue non-traditional styles. Especially given that many of these students are students of color, we should reject the image of them as lawless, self-interested vigilantes. Students work hard on their positions, often incorporating personal elements such as narrative or performance. To defend a view of debate that excludes their arguments from consideration devalues their scholarship and the way they make debate \u201chome.\u201d That\u2019s unacceptable. Branse notes \u201cthe motivation for joining the activity substantially varies from person to person\u201d yet excludes some debaters\u2019 motivations while promoting others (5, para. 4). We agree with Smith on the very tangible effects of such exclusion: \u201cIf black students do not feel comfortable participating in LD they will lose out on the ability to judge, coach, or to force debate to deal with the truth of their perspectives\u201d (para. 5). Of course, we do not believe that Nebel or Branse intend their views to have these effects, but they are a concern we need to take seriously. III. Changing the Rules In Round One thought is that rejecting truth-testing is the wrong solution. Instead, we should create a better topic-selection process or an NSDA-approved topic change when the resolution is particularly bad. These solutions, however, are not exclusive of a rejection of truth-testing. An offensive topic might be reason to reform the selection process and to stop debating it immediately. Good role of the ballot arguments are the best solution because they pinpoint exactly why a debater finds the resolution inadequate. They highlight the problems of the proposed topic of discussion, and outline reasons why a different approach is preferable. While Branse believes these examples of in-round rule-making are problematic, we think debate rounds are an excellent location for discussing what debate should be. The first reason is the failure of consensus. Because there are a wide variety of supported methods to go about debating, we should be cautious about paradigmatic exclusion. While we don\u2019t defend the relativist conclusion that all styles of debate are equally valuable, there is significant disagreement that our theories must account for. Truth-testing denies a number of ways to debate that many find valuable. The second reason is the internalization of valuable principles. Even people who do not think kritiks are the right way to debate have taken important steps like removing gendered language from their positions. NDT champion Elijah Smith (2013) identified hateful arguments and comments \u201cyou expect to hear at a Klan rally\u201d as commonplace in LD rounds and the community (para. 2). We\u2019d like to think those instances are at least reduced by the argumentation he\u2019s encouraged. For instance, the much-maligned \u201cyou must prove why oppression is bad\u201d argument now sees little play in high-level circuit rounds. Truth-testing forecloses this kind of learning from the opposition. Roles of the ballot and theory interpretations are examples of how in-round argumentation creates new rules of engagement. We welcome these strategies, and debaters should be prepared to justify their proposed rules against procedural challenges. The arguments we have made thus far are objections to truth-testing as a top-down worldview used to exclude from the get-go, not in-round means of redress against certain practices. There is a major difference between a topicality argument in a high school debate round and a prominent debate coach and camp director\u2019s glib dismissal of non-topical argument as follows: [Y]ou can talk about whatever you want, but if it doesn\u2019t support or deny the resolution, then the judge shouldn\u2019t vote on it (Nebel 2015, 1.2, para. 4) Branse is equally ideological: Within the debate, the judge is bound by the established rules. If the rules are failing their function, that can be a reason to change the rules outside of the round. However, in round acts are out of the judge\u2019s jurisdiction (2, para. 12) We take issue with debate theorists\u2019 attempts to define away arguments that they don\u2019t like. At one point, Jason Baldwin (2009) actually defended truth-testing for its openness, praising the values of the free market of ideas: That\u2019s how the marketplace of ideas is supposed to work. But it is supposed to be a free marketplace where buyers (judges) examine whatever sellers (debaters) offer them with an open mind, not an exclusive marketplace where only the sellers of some officially approved theories are welcome (p. 26) Unfortunately for the truth-tester, debate has changed, and it will change again. What was once a model that allowed all the arguments debaters wanted to make \u2013 a prioris, frameworks, and meta-ethics \u2013 is now outdated in the context of discursive kritiks, performance, and alternative roles of the ballot. IV. Constitutivism, Authority, and the Nature of Debate Branse\u2019s goal is to derive substantive rules for debate from the \u2018constitutive features\u2019 of debate itself and the roles of competitors and judges. We\u2019ll quote him at length here to get a full view of the argument: [P]ragmatic benefits are constrained by the rules of the activity\u2026.education should not be promoted at the expense of the rules since the rules are what define the activity. LD is only LD because of the rules governing it \u2013 if we changed the activity to promoting practical values, then it would cease to be what it is (2, para. 7) Internal rules of an activity are absolute. From the perspective of the players, the authority of the rules are non-optional. (2, para. 12) The resolution, in fact, offers one of the only constitutive guidelines for debate. Most tournament invitations put a sentence in the rules along the lines of, \u201cwe will be using [X Resolution].\u201d Thus, discussion confined to the resolution is non-optional (3, para. 5) [T]he delineation of an \u201caffirmative\u201d and a \u201cnegative\u201d establishes a compelling case for a truth testing model\u2026two debaters constrained by the rules of their assignment \u2013 to uphold or deny the truth of the resolution\u2026[J]udging the quality of the debaters requires a reference to their roles. The better aff is the debater who is better at proving the resolution true. The better neg is the debater who is better at denying the truth of the resolution. The ballot requests an answer to \u201cwho did a comparatively better job fulfilling their role\u201d, and since debaters\u2019 roles dictate a truth-testing model, the judge ought to adjudicate the round under a truth testing model of debate. The judge does not have the jurisdiction to vote on education rather than truth testing (3, para. 7-8) Once a judge commits to a round in accordance with a set of rules\u2026the rules are absolute and non-optional (4, para. 4) Similarly, Nebel uses contractual logic \u2013 appealing to the tournament invitation as binding agreement \u2013 to justify truth-testing: \u201cThe \u201csocial contract\u201d argument holds that accepting a tournament invitation constitutes implicit consent to debate the specified topic\u2026.given that some proposition must be debated in each round and that the tournament has specified a resolution, no one can reasonably reject a principle that requires everyone to debate the announced resolution as worded. This appeals to Scanlon\u2019s contractualism (1.1, para. 2) This approach is attractive because it seeks to start from principles we all seem to agree on and some very simple definitions. The primary problem is that the starting point is very thin, but the end point includes very robust conclusions. The terms \u201caffirmative\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d are insufficient to produce universal rules for debate, and certainly do not imply truth-testing (Section I, paragraph 3.) Branse does some legwork in footnoting several definitions of \u201caffirm\u201d and \u201cnegate,\u201d but does little in the way of linguistic analysis. We won\u2019t defend a particular definition but point out that there are many definitions that vary and do not all lend themselves to truth-testing. On a ballot the words \u201cspeaker points\u201d are as prominently displayed as the words \u201caffirmative\u201d or \u201cnegative,\u201d but neither Branse nor Nebel attempt to make any constitutive inference from their existence. Further, to find the constitutive role of a thing, one needs to look at what the thing actually is, rather than a few specific words on a ballot. Looking at debates now, we see that they rarely conform to the truth-testing model. It is simply absurd to observe an activity full of plans, counterplans, kritiks, non-topical performances, theory arguments, etc. and claim that its \u2018constitutive nature\u2019 is to exclude these arguments. Not only that, but the truth-testing family has been heavily criticized in both the policy and LD communities (Hynes Jr., 1979; Lichtman & Rohrer, 1982; Mangus, 2008; Nelson, 2008; O\u2019Donnell, 2003; O\u2019Krent, 2014; Palmer, 2008; Rowland, 1981; Simon, 1984; Snider, 1994; Ulrich, 1983). The empirical evidence also points toward argumentative inclusion in three important ways. The first is argument trends. The popularity of kritiks, a prioris, meta-ethics, etc. confirm that at different times the community at large has very different views of what constitutes not only a good argument but also a good mode of affirming or negating. The second is argument cycles. An alternate view would suggest that debate evolves and leaves bad arguments by the wayside. Nevertheless, we see lots of arguments pop in and out of the meta-game, suggesting that we have not made a definitive verdict on the best way to debate. The third is judge deference. While people\u2019s views on proper modes of debate shift, we retain a strong deference to a judge\u2019s decision. Judges have different views of debate; if there were some overarching principle that all judges should follow, we would expect tournament directors to enforce such a rule. In sum, there is no way to view debate as a whole and see truth-testing as the general principle underlying our practices. The existence of a judge and a ballot are also insufficient to produce universal rules for debate. Branse thinks \u201c[t]he ballot requests an answer to \u2018who did a comparatively better job fulfilling their role.\u2019\u201d While that may be a valid concern, it is dependent on what the judge views the roles of debaters to be. The absence of any sort of instruction other than determining the \u2018better debating\u2019 or the \u2018winner\u2019 most naturally lends itself to a presumption of openness. In fact, many practices very explicitly deviate from the constitutive roles Branse lays out. Some counterplans (PICs, PCCs, topical CPs and the like) may do more to prove the resolution than disprove it, yet are generally accepted negative arguments. Another type of objection to Branse\u2019s view is an application of David Enoch\u2019s \u201cagency shmagency\u201d argument. Enoch (2011) summarizes in his paper \u201cShmagency revisited\u201d: [E]ven if you find yourself engaging in a kind of an activity\u2026inescapably\u2026and even if that activity is constitutively governed by some norm or\u2026aim, this does not suffice for you to have a reason to obey that norm or aim at that aim. Rather, what is also needed is that you have a reason to engage in that activity\u2026Even if you somehow find yourself playing chess, and even if checkmating your opponent is a constitutive aim of playing chess, still you may not have a reason to (try to) checkmate your opponent. You may lack such a reason if you lack a reason to play chess. The analogy is clear enough: Even if you find yourself playing the agency game, and even if agency has a constitutive aim, still you may not have a reason to be an agent (for instance, rather than a shmagent) (p. 5-6) The application to chess helps us see the application to debate. Truth-testing may be the constitutive aim of doing debate, but it does not follow that our best reasons tell us to test the truth of the resolution. In fact, you may have no reasons to be a truth-testing debater in the first place. If \u201caffirmative\u201d means \u201cthe one who proves the resolution true,\u201d we\u2019ve demonstrated times when it\u2019s better to be \u201cshmaffirmative\u201d than \u201caffirmative.\u201d Finally, we think one of the most important (perhaps constitutive) features of debate is its unique capacity to change the rules while playing within the rules. Education-based arguments and non-topical arguments are just arguments \u2013 they\u2019re pieces on the chess board to be manipulated by the players. Branse concedes that in APDA debate, the resolution is \u201ccontestable through a formal, in-round mechanism (3, para. 9). LD and policy debate also have this mechanism through theory arguments, kritiks, and alternative roles of the ballot. Branse is right that in soccer and chess, there is no way to kick a ball or move a chess piece that would legitimately change the rules of the game. Debate is different. While soccer and chess have incontrovertible empirical conditions for victory (checkmates, more goals at fulltime), debate does not. In fact, discussing the win conditions is debating! Whenever a debater reads a case, they assume or justify certain win conditions and not others. This deals with Branse\u2019s \u201cself-defeatingness\u201d objection because debate about the rules does not create a \u201cfree-for-all\u201d \u2014 it creates a debate (6, para. 1). The truth-testing judge does not get to pick and choose what makes a good debate; to do so is necessarily interventionist. This demonstrates truth-testing is more arbitrary and subjective [2] than the education position Branse criticizes (4, para. 4; 5, para. 2, 5). To be truly non-interventionist, we should accept them as permissible arguments until proven otherwise in round. Of course, not all rules are up for debate. There is a distinction between rules like speech times (call these procedural rules) and rules like truth-testing (call these substantive rules). The former are not up for the debate in the sense that the tournament director could intervene if a debater refused to stop talking. The latter are debate-able and have been for some time. No tournament director enforces their pet paradigm. Because the tournament director, not the judge, has ultimate authority, we liken her to the referee in soccer. On this view, the judge is not the referee tasked with enforcing \u201cthe rules\u201d; she should decide only on the basis of arguments presented in the debate. Tournaments are not subject to any form of higher authority and are not obligated to follow NSDA rules, TOC guidelines, or anything else to determine a winner. Something is only a procedural rule if it is enforced by the tournament, and truth-testing has not and shouldn\u2019t be enforced in this manner. To our knowledge, no bid tournament director has ever imposed a truth-testing burden on all competitors. If anything is a binding contract, it is the judge paradigm. Judge philosophies or paradigms are explicitly agreed to in writing because each judge establishes their own, and there is no coercion at play. Most tournaments mandate or strongly encourage written paradigms, have time to review them, and accept judge services instead of payment for hiring a judge. These norms establish a clearer contractual agreement in favor of judge deferral than universal truth-testing. We have tested the constitutive and contractual arguments by considering how truth-testing is not a procedural rule like speech times. As such, it cannot accrue the benefits of bindingness, authority, and non-arbitrariness. We can also test the argument in the opposite direction. There are some rules that seem even more \u201cconstitutive\u201d of debate than the resolution but are not examples of procedural rules. For instance, every judge and debate theorist would likely reject completely new arguments in the 2AR, but there is nothing within Branse\u2019s constitutive rules (speech times, the resolution, the aff and neg) to justify the norm. The no-new-arguments rule does not need to be written in a rulebook to have a lot of force. V. Pragmatic Justifications for Truth-testing With the priority of pragmatics established and constitutive arguments well addressed, we turn to some hybrid arguments that attempt to justify truth-testing by appealing to pragmatics. Nebel argues that the advantages stemming from truth-testing must be weighed against all exceptions to it and that the advantages of debating the \u2018true meaning\u2019 of the topic nearly always outweigh: It would be better if everyone debated the resolution as worded, whatever it is, than if everyone debated whatever subtle variation on the resolution they favored. Affirmatives would unfairly abuse (and have already abused) the entitlement to choose their own unpredictable adventure, and negatives would respond (and have already responded) with strategies that are designed to avoid clash\u2026people are more likely to act on mistaken utility calculations and engage in self-serving violations of useful rules (1.1, para. 2) However, the advantages of topicality for the semantic/truth-testing view hold on the pragmatic view as well. We agree that the reasons to debate the meaning of the topic are strong. The only difference is that the pragmatic theory can explain the possibility of exceptions to the rule without interpretive contortion. It makes much more sense to understand that strict topicality is just a very good practice than to tout it as an absolute, lexically prior, constitutively- and contractually-binding rule. Ultimately, all benefits to topicality and debating something other than the resolution are weighed on the same scale, so we should adopt the theory that explicitly allows that scale. We are unconvinced that direct appeals to pragmatic considerations would be worse on pragmatic grounds than an external and absolute rule like \u2018always be topical.\u2019 If topicality is as important and beneficial as Nebel says it is, then it should be easy to defend within a particular debate, avoiding the worst slippery slope scenarios. Nebel also argues that the pragmatic view \u201cjustifies debating propositions that are completely irrelevant to the resolution but are much better to debate\u201d (1.1, para. 5). Branse makes the same claim about education: \u201cEducation as a voting issue legitimizes reading positions and debating topics that have no association with the resolution\u201d (5, para. 3). This alarmism we\u2019ve answered with our discussion of harmful resolutions. There is no empirical indication of a slippery slope to a world where no one discusses the topic. The disadvantages to one debate round departing from topical debate are quite small, and we have no problem biting the bullet here. Sometimes (and it may be very rare), it\u2019s better not to debate the resolution. There may also be reasons to debate something else even when the resolution is very good. Black students should not have to wait for a reparations topic to talk about race in America. As conversations about racial oppression and police brutality grow louder and louder, it becomes increasingly unreasonable to defend a view of debate that ignores their relevance to the everyday lives of our students. It should be clear that the pragmatic view takes no absolute stance on topicality or burdens. A debate practice may be pragmatic in one context but not another. For that reason, we reject the narrowness of truth-testing."], "id": "452635c2139d56bc02897400dbad9286758f4726f5a6b292fcc09c81b284d2f6", "highlighted_text": "to allow exceptions, proves that concerns can trump the topicality rule Any advantage to allowing kritiks , performances, and roles of the ballot justifies this when we implicitly suggest such theses have no value devalues the way they make debate \u201chome in-round argumentation creates new rules of engagement debaters should be prepared to justify proposed rules affirmative\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d are insufficient to produce universal rules It is absurd to observe plans, kritiks theory arguments, etc. and claim its \u2018constitutive nature\u2019 is to exclude these at different times the community has very different views Shmagency it does not follow reasons tell us to test the truth of the resolution one constitutive) features of debate is its capacity to change the rules While soccer and chess have incontrovertible empirical conditions debate does not discussing win conditions is debating Something is only procedural if it is enforced by the tournament", "highlights": [[2, 2686, 2706], [2, 2720, 2731], [2, 2744, 2756], [2, 2764, 2789], [2, 3636, 3661], [2, 3673, 3680], [2, 3680, 3719], [2, 3728, 3742], [2, 4763, 4770], [2, 4785, 4820], [2, 4831, 4833], [2, 4834, 4839], [2, 5697, 5705], [2, 5728, 5758], [2, 8347, 8401], [2, 8436, 8474], [2, 8481, 8495], [2, 12861, 12877], [2, 12878, 12932], [2, 13727, 13732], [2, 13740, 13757], [2, 13778, 13784], [2, 13799, 13806], [2, 13834, 13866], [2, 13872, 13917], [2, 14403, 14435], [2, 14445, 14469], [2, 16138, 16147], [2, 17079, 17097], [2, 17112, 17163], [2, 17416, 17419], [2, 17451, 17490], [2, 17498, 17526], [2, 18107, 18172], [2, 18223, 18238], [2, 18249, 18259], [2, 18264, 18290], [2, 19777, 19794], [2, 19797, 19807], [2, 19813, 19848]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 132], [2, 313, 489], [2, 946, 1008], [2, 1034, 1080], [2, 1167, 1273], [2, 1275, 1386], [2, 1536, 1624], [2, 2511, 2633], [2, 2677, 2685], [2, 2686, 2706], [2, 2707, 2719], [2, 2720, 2731], [2, 2732, 2743], [2, 2744, 2756], [2, 2757, 2763], [2, 2764, 2789], [2, 2789, 2790], [2, 3168, 3339], [2, 3503, 3634], [2, 3636, 3661], [2, 3662, 3672], [2, 3673, 3680], [2, 3680, 3719], [2, 3720, 3727], [2, 3728, 3742], [2, 3743, 3779], [2, 3825, 3838], [2, 3855, 3964], [2, 4641, 4762], [2, 4763, 4770], [2, 4771, 4784], [2, 4785, 4820], [2, 4821, 4830], [2, 4831, 4833], [2, 4834, 4839], [2, 4840, 5012], [2, 5222, 5365], [2, 5510, 5696], [2, 5697, 5705], [2, 5706, 5727], [2, 5728, 5758], [2, 5761, 5780], [2, 6026, 6084], [2, 6085, 6087], [2, 6088, 6202], [2, 7107, 7192], [2, 7240, 7366], [2, 7534, 7700], [2, 7701, 7708], [2, 7709, 7816], [2, 8212, 8279], [2, 8347, 8401], [2, 8436, 8474], [2, 8475, 8480], [2, 8481, 8495], [2, 8496, 8525], [2, 9359, 9413], [2, 9738, 9838], [2, 9883, 9927], [2, 10209, 10217], [2, 10218, 10355], [2, 10597, 10644], [2, 12765, 12848], [2, 12850, 12861], [2, 12861, 12877], [2, 12878, 12932], [2, 12933, 12985], [2, 13148, 13291], [2, 13506, 13642], [2, 13727, 13732], [2, 13733, 13739], [2, 13740, 13757], [2, 13758, 13777], [2, 13778, 13784], [2, 13785, 13798], [2, 13799, 13806], [2, 13806, 13833], [2, 13834, 13866], [2, 13867, 13871], [2, 13872, 13917], [2, 13918, 13927], [2, 14304, 14351], [2, 14352, 14359], [2, 14359, 14362], [2, 14363, 14370], [2, 14370, 14402], [2, 14403, 14435], [2, 14436, 14444], [2, 14445, 14469], [2, 14470, 14560], [2, 15270, 15367], [2, 16138, 16147], [2, 17016, 17078], [2, 17079, 17097], [2, 17098, 17111], [2, 17112, 17163], [2, 17248, 17362], [2, 17362, 17376], [2, 17376, 17395], [2, 17416, 17419], [2, 17420, 17450], [2, 17451, 17490], [2, 17491, 17497], [2, 17498, 17526], [2, 17527, 17557], [2, 17559, 17698], [2, 18107, 18172], [2, 18173, 18222], [2, 18223, 18238], [2, 18249, 18259], [2, 18260, 18263], [2, 18264, 18290], [2, 18666, 18730], [2, 18923, 18965], [2, 19113, 19244], [2, 19302, 19463], [2, 19777, 19794], [2, 19795, 19796], [2, 19797, 19807], [2, 19808, 19812], [2, 19813, 19848], [2, 19848, 19916], [2, 24032, 24124], [2, 24126, 24342]], "emphasis": [[2, 313, 489], [2, 1536, 1624], [2, 5761, 5780], [2, 8212, 8279], [2, 12850, 12861], [2, 12861, 12877], [2, 12878, 12932], [2, 12933, 12985], [2, 18249, 18259], [2, 18260, 18263], [2, 18264, 18290], [2, 24032, 24124]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 22]], "filename": "JANFEB19_-_Disads_and_Case.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2015-09-10"}, {"tag": "TJFs", "cite": "1NC \u2013 Util Normal", "body": ["Nagel 86 Thomas Nagel 86, The View from Nowhere, HUP, 1986: 156-168. / MM BRACKETS FOR GENDERED LANGUAGE**", "I shall defend the unsurprising claim that sensory pleasure is good and pain bad, no matter who they are. The point of the exercise is to see how the pressures of objectification operate in a simple case. Physical pleasure and pain do not usually depend on activities or desires which themselves raise questions of justification and value. They are just sensory experiences in relation to which we are fairly passive, but toward which we feel involuntary desire or aversion. Almost everyone takes the avoidance of [their] own pain and the promotion of [their] own pleasure as subjective reasons for action in a fairly simple way; they are not back up by any further reasons. On the other hand if someone pursues pain or avoids pleasure, either it as a means to some end or it is backed up by dark reasons like guilt or sexual masochism. What sort of general value, if any, ought to be assigned to pleasure and pain when we consider these facts from an objective standpoint? What kind of judgment can we reasonably make about 2these things when we view them in abstraction from who we are? We can begin by asking why there is no plausibility in the zero position, that pleasure and pain have no value of any kind that can be objectively recognized. That would mean that I have no reason to take aspirin for a severe headache, however I may in fact be motivated; and that looking at it from outside, you couldn't even say that someone had a reason not to put his hand on a hot stove, just because of the pain. Try looking at it from the outside and see whether you can manage to withhold that judgment. If the idea of objective practical reason makes any sense at all, so that there is some judgment to withhold, it does not seem possible. If the general arguments against the reality of objective reasons are no good, then it is at least possible that I have a reason, and not just an inclination, to refrain from putting my hand on a hot stove. But given the possibility, it seems meaningless to deny that this is so. Oddly enough, however, we can think of a story that would go with such a denial. It might be suggested that the aversion to pain is a useful phobia\u2014having nothing to do with the intrinsic undesirability of pain itself\u2014which helps us avoid or escape the injuries that are signaled by pain. (The same type of purely instrumental value might be ascribed to sensory pleasure: the pleasures of food, drink, and sex might be regarded as having no value in themselves, though our natural attraction to them assists survival and reproduction.) There would then be nothing wrong with pain in itself, and someone who was never motivated deliberately to do anything just because he knew it would reduce or avoid pain would have nothing the matter with him. [They] would have involuntary avoidance reactions, otherwise it would be hard to say that [they] felt pain at all. And [they] would be motivated to reduce pain for other reasons\u2014because it was an effective way to avoid the danger being signaled, or because interfered with some physical or mental activity that was important to [them]. He just wouldn't regard the pain as itself something he had any reason to avoid, even though he hated the feeling just as much as the rest of us. (And of course he wouldn't be able to justify the avoidance of pain in the way that we customarily justify avoiding what we hate without reason\u2014that is, on the ground that even an irrational hatred makes its object very unpleasant!) There is nothing self-contradictory in this proposal, but it seems nevertheless insane. Without some positive reason to think there is nothing in itself good or bad about having an experience you intensely like or dislike, we can't seriously regard the common impression to the contrary as a collective illusion. Such things are at least good or bad for us, if anything is. What seems to be going on here is that we cannot from an objective standpoint withhold a certain kind of endorsement of the most direct and immediate subjective value judgments we make concerning the contents of our own consciousness. We regard ourselves as too close to those things to be mistaken in our immediate, nonideological evaluative impressions.

Robert Nozick, for example, argues that \u201cto use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has.\u201d But why is this not equally true of all those whom we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, we fail to sufficiently respect and take account of the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction. In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? A morally good agent recognizes that the basis of all particular duties is the principle that \u201crational nature exists as an end in itself\u201d. Rational nature as such is the supreme objective end of all conduct. If one truly believes that all rational beings have an equal value, then the rational solution to such a dilemma involves maximally promoting the lives and liberties of as many rational beings as possible. In order to avoid this conclusion, the non-consequentialist Kantian needs to justify agent-centered constraints. As we saw in chapter 1, however, even most Kantian deontologists recognize that agent-centered constraints require a non- value-based rationale. But we have seen that Kant\u2019s normative theory is based on an unconditionally valuable end. How can a concern for the value of rational beings lead to a refusal to sacrifice rational beings even when this would prevent other more extensive losses of rational beings? If the moral law is based on the value of rational beings and their ends, then what is the rationale for prohibiting a moral agent from maximally promoting these two tiers of value? If I sacrifice some for the sake of others, I do not use them arbitrarily, and I do not deny the unconditional value of rational beings.

The point of the exercise is to see how the pressures of objectification operate in a simple case. Physical pleasure and pain do not usually depend on activities or desires which themselves raise questions of justification and value. They are just sensory experiences in relation to which we are fairly passive, but toward which we feel involuntary desire or aversion. Almost everyone takes the avoidance of [their] own pain and the promotion of [their] own pleasure as subjective reasons for action in a fairly simple way; they are not back up by any further reasons. On the other hand if someone pursues pain or avoids pleasure, either it as a means to some end or it is backed up by dark reasons like guilt or sexual masochism. What sort of general value, if any, ought to be assigned to pleasure and pain when we consider these facts from an objective standpoint? What kind of judgment can we reasonably make about 2these things when we view them in abstraction from who we are? We can begin by asking why there is no plausibility in the zero position, that pleasure and pain have no value of any kind that can be objectively recognized. That would mean that I have no reason to take aspirin for a severe headache, however I may in fact be motivated; and that looking at it from outside, you couldn't even say that someone had a reason not to put his hand on a hot stove, just because of the pain. Try looking at it from the outside and see whether you can manage to withhold that judgment. If the idea of objective practical reason makes any sense at all, so that there is some judgment to withhold, it does not seem possible. If the general arguments against the reality of objective reasons are no good, then it is at least possible that I have a reason, and not just an inclination, to refrain from putting my hand on a hot stove. But given the possibility, it seems meaningless to deny that this is so. Oddly enough, however, we can think of a story that would go with such a denial. It might be suggested that the aversion to pain is a useful phobia\u2014having nothing to do with the intrinsic undesirability of pain itself\u2014which helps us avoid or escape the injuries that are signaled by pain. (The same type of purely instrumental value might be ascribed to sensory pleasure: the pleasures of food, drink, and sex might be regarded as having no value in themselves, though our natural attraction to them assists survival and reproduction.) There would then be nothing wrong with pain in itself, and someone who was never motivated deliberately to do anything just because he knew it would reduce or avoid pain would have nothing the matter with him. [They] would have involuntary avoidance reactions, otherwise it would be hard to say that [they] felt pain at all. And [they] would be motivated to reduce pain for other reasons\u2014because it was an effective way to avoid the danger being signaled, or because interfered with some physical or mental activity that was important to [them]. He just wouldn't regard the pain as itself something he had any reason to avoid, even though he hated the feeling just as much as the rest of us. (And of course he wouldn't be able to justify the avoidance of pain in the way that we customarily justify avoiding what we hate without reason\u2014that is, on the ground that even an irrational hatred makes its object very unpleasant!) There is nothing self-contradictory in this proposal, but it seems nevertheless insane. Without some positive reason to think there is nothing in itself good or bad about having an experience you intensely like or dislike, we can't seriously regard the common impression to the contrary as a collective illusion. Such things are at least good or bad for us, if anything is. What seems to be going on here is that we cannot from an objective standpoint withhold a certain kind of endorsement of the most direct and immediate subjective value judgments we make concerning the contents of our own consciousness. We regard ourselves as too close to those things to be mistaken in our immediate, nonideological evaluative impressions.

It might seem obvious that human extinction would be a very bad thing, both because of the loss of potential future lives, and because of the loss of the scientific and artistic progress that we would make in the future. But the issue is at least unclear. The continuation of the human race would be a mixed bag: inevitably, it would involve both upsides and downsides. And if one regards it as much more important to avoid bad things happening than to promote good things happening then one could plausibly regard human extinction as a good thing.For example, one might regard the prevention of bads as being in general more important that the promotion of goods, as defended historically by G. E. Moore,185 and more recently by Thomas Hurka.186 One could weight the prevention of suffering as being much more important that the promotion of happiness. Or one could weight the prevention of objective bads, such as war and genocide, as being much more important than the promotion of objective goods, such as scientific and artistic progress. If the human race continues its future will inevitably involve suffering as well as happiness, and objective bads as well as objective goods. So, if one weights the bads sufficiently heavily against the goods, or if one is sufficiently pessimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to achieve good outcomes, then one will regard human extinction as a good thing.187 However, even if we believe in a moral view according to which human extinction would be a good thing, we still have strong reason to prevent near-term human extinction. To see this, we must note three points. First, we should note that the extinction of the human race is an extremely high stakes moral issue. Humanity could be around for a very long time: if humans survive as long as the median mammal species, we will last another two million years. On this estimate, the number of humans in existence in the The future, given that we don\u2019t go extinct any time soon, would be [over 20 quadrillion]. So if it is good to bring new people into existence, then it\u2019s very good to prevent human extinction. Second, human extinction is by its nature an irreversible scenario. If we continue to exist, then we always have the option of letting ourselves go extinct in the future (or, perhaps more realistically, of considerably reducing population size). But if we go extinct, then we can\u2019t magically bring ourselves back into existence at a later date. Third, we should expect ourselves to progress, morally, over the next few centuries, as we have progressed in the past. So we should expect that in a few centuries\u2019 time we will have better evidence about how to evaluate human extinction than we currently have. Given these three factors, it would be better to prevent the near-term extinction of the human race, even if we thought that the extinction of the human race would actually be a very good thing. To make this concrete, I\u2019ll give the following simple but illustrative model. Suppose that we have 0.8 credence that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 0.2 certain that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people; and the degree to which it is good to produce new people, if it is good, is the same as the degree to which it is bad to produce new people, if it is bad. That is, I\u2019m supposing, for simplicity, that we know that one new life has one unit of value; we just don\u2019t know whether that unit is positive or negative. And let\u2019s use our estimate of 2\u00d710^14 people who would exist in the future, if we avoid near-term human extinction. Given our stipulated credences, the expected benefit of letting the human race go extinct now would be (.8-.2)\u00d7(2\u00d710^14) = 1.2\u00d7(10^14). Suppose that, if we let the human race continue and did research for 300 years, we would know for certain whether or not additional people are of positive or negative value. If so, then with the credences above we should think it 80% likely that we will find out that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 20% likely that we will find out that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people. So there\u2019s an 80% chance of a loss of 3\u00d7(10^10) (because of the delay of letting the human race go extinct), the expected value of which is 2.4\u00d7(10^10).

The point of the exercise is to see how the pressures of objectification operate in a simple case. Physical pleasure and pain do not usually depend on activities or desires which themselves raise questions of justification and value. They are just sensory experiences in relation to which we are fairly passive, but toward which we feel involuntary desire or aversion. Almost everyone takes the avoidance of [their] own pain and the promotion of [their] own pleasure as subjective reasons for action in a fairly simple way; they are not back up by any further reasons. On the other hand if someone pursues pain or avoids pleasure, either it as a means to some end or it is backed up by dark reasons like guilt or sexual masochism. What sort of general value, if any, ought to be assigned to pleasure and pain when we consider these facts from an objective standpoint? What kind of judgment can we reasonably make about 2these things when we view them in abstraction from who we are? We can begin by asking why there is no plausibility in the zero position, that pleasure and pain have no value of any kind that can be objectively recognized. That would mean that I have no reason to take aspirin for a severe headache, however I may in fact be motivated; and that looking at it from outside, you couldn't even say that someone had a reason not to put his hand on a hot stove, just because of the pain. Try looking at it from the outside and see whether you can manage to withhold that judgment. If the idea of objective practical reason makes any sense at all, so that there is some judgment to withhold, it does not seem possible. If the general arguments against the reality of objective reasons are no good, then it is at least possible that I have a reason, and not just an inclination, to refrain from putting my hand on a hot stove. But given the possibility, it seems meaningless to deny that this is so. Oddly enough, however, we can think of a story that would go with such a denial. It might be suggested that the aversion to pain is a useful phobia\u2014having nothing to do with the intrinsic undesirability of pain itself\u2014which helps us avoid or escape the injuries that are signaled by pain. (The same type of purely instrumental value might be ascribed to sensory pleasure: the pleasures of food, drink, and sex might be regarded as having no value in themselves, though our natural attraction to them assists survival and reproduction.) There would then be nothing wrong with pain in itself, and someone who was never motivated deliberately to do anything just because he knew it would reduce or avoid pain would have nothing the matter with him. [They] would have involuntary avoidance reactions, otherwise it would be hard to say that [they] felt pain at all. And [they] would be motivated to reduce pain for other reasons\u2014because it was an effective way to avoid the danger being signaled, or because interfered with some physical or mental activity that was important to [them]. He just wouldn't regard the pain as itself something he had any reason to avoid, even though he hated the feeling just as much as the rest of us. (And of course he wouldn't be able to justify the avoidance of pain in the way that we customarily justify avoiding what we hate without reason\u2014that is, on the ground that even an irrational hatred makes its object very unpleasant!) There is nothing self-contradictory in this proposal, but it seems nevertheless insane. Without some positive reason to think there is nothing in itself good or bad about having an experience you intensely like or dislike, we can't seriously regard the common impression to the contrary as a collective illusion. Such things are at least good or bad for us, if anything is. What seems to be going on here is that we cannot from an objective standpoint withhold a certain kind of endorsement of the most direct and immediate subjective value judgments we make concerning the contents of our own consciousness. We regard ourselves as too close to those things to be mistaken in our immediate, nonideological evaluative impressions. No objective view we can attain could possibly overrule our subjective authority in such cases.

Such an evil need not be consciously experienced in order to be an evil for the kind of being a human person is. Death is an evil because of the change in kind it brings about, a change that is destructive of the type of entity that we essentially are. Anything, whether caused naturally or caused by human intervention (intentional or unintentional) that drastically interferes in the process of maintaining the person in existence is an objective evil for the person. What is crucially at stake here, and is dialectically supportive of the self-evidency of the basic good of human life, is that death is a radical interference with the current life process of the kind of being that we are. In consequence, death itself can be credibly thought of as a \u2018primitive evil\u2019 for all persons, regardless of the extent to which they are currently or prospectively capable of participating in a full array of the goods of life.81  In conclusion, concerning willed human actions, it is justifiable to state that any intentional rejection of human life itself cannot therefore be warranted since it is an expression of an ultimate disvalue for the subject, namely, the destruction of the present person; a radical ontological good that we cannot begin to weigh objectively against the travails of life in a rational manner. To deal with the sources of disvalue (pain, suffering, etc.) we should not seek to irrationally destroy the person, the very source and condition of all human possibility.82 "], "id": "6803eb9431674524f3940324d4f08cfa798980e791a903c7c2d2c92acae5009a", "highlighted_text": "death is evil not because it deprives us of a future Rather, death in itself is evil because it ontologically destroys the subject independently of calculations about better or worse possible lives.

It might seem obvious that human extinction would be a very bad thing, both because of the loss of potential future lives, and because of the loss of the scientific and artistic progress that we would make in the future. But the issue is at least unclear. The continuation of the human race would be a mixed bag: inevitably, it would involve both upsides and downsides. And if one regards it as much more important to avoid bad things happening than to promote good things happening then one could plausibly regard human extinction as a good thing.For example, one might regard the prevention of bads as being in general more important that the promotion of goods, as defended historically by G. E. Moore,185 and more recently by Thomas Hurka.186 One could weight the prevention of suffering as being much more important that the promotion of happiness. Or one could weight the prevention of objective bads, such as war and genocide, as being much more important than the promotion of objective goods, such as scientific and artistic progress. If the human race continues its future will inevitably involve suffering as well as happiness, and objective bads as well as objective goods. So, if one weights the bads sufficiently heavily against the goods, or if one is sufficiently pessimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to achieve good outcomes, then one will regard human extinction as a good thing.187 However, even if we believe in a moral view according to which human extinction would be a good thing, we still have strong reason to prevent near-term human extinction. To see this, we must note three points. First, we should note that the extinction of the human race is an extremely high stakes moral issue. Humanity could be around for a very long time: if humans survive as long as the median mammal species, we will last another two million years. On this estimate, the number of humans in existence in the The future, given that we don\u2019t go extinct any time soon, would be [over 20 quadrillion]. So if it is good to bring new people into existence, then it\u2019s very good to prevent human extinction. Second, human extinction is by its nature an irreversible scenario. If we continue to exist, then we always have the option of letting ourselves go extinct in the future (or, perhaps more realistically, of considerably reducing population size). But if we go extinct, then we can\u2019t magically bring ourselves back into existence at a later date. Third, we should expect ourselves to progress, morally, over the next few centuries, as we have progressed in the past. So we should expect that in a few centuries\u2019 time we will have better evidence about how to evaluate human extinction than we currently have. Given these three factors, it would be better to prevent the near-term extinction of the human race, even if we thought that the extinction of the human race would actually be a very good thing. To make this concrete, I\u2019ll give the following simple but illustrative model. Suppose that we have 0.8 credence that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 0.2 certain that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people; and the degree to which it is good to produce new people, if it is good, is the same as the degree to which it is bad to produce new people, if it is bad. That is, I\u2019m supposing, for simplicity, that we know that one new life has one unit of value; we just don\u2019t know whether that unit is positive or negative. And let\u2019s use our estimate of 2\u00d710^14 people who would exist in the future, if we avoid near-term human extinction. Given our stipulated credences, the expected benefit of letting the human race go extinct now would be (.8-.2)\u00d7(2\u00d710^14) = 1.2\u00d7(10^14). Suppose that, if we let the human race continue and did research for 300 years, we would know for certain whether or not additional people are of positive or negative value. If so, then with the credences above we should think it 80% likely that we will find out that it is a bad thing to produce new people, and 20% likely that we will find out that it\u2019s a good thing to produce new people. So there\u2019s an 80% chance of a loss of 3\u00d7(10^10) (because of the delay of letting the human race go extinct), the expected value of which is 2.4\u00d7(10^10). But there\u2019s also a 20% chance of a gain of 2\u00d7(10^14), the expected value of which is 4\u00d7(10^13). That is, in expected value terms, the cost of waiting for a few hundred years is vanishingly small compared with the benefit of keeping one\u2019s options open while one gains new information."], "id": "e59f221e67f34294196b92322ac88c26538040bdbbacc16e88521233474e369d", "highlighted_text": "The human race might go extinct asteroids, supervolcanoes , climate change all pose risks human extinction would be bad because of the loss of potential future lives, and the loss of the scientific progress that we would make we have strong reason to prevent near-term extinction .

Looking at the world as a whole, however, the situation is more dangerous than ever before. The number of nations possessing nuclear weapons\u00a0has increased by two, with the addition of Pakistan\u00a0and India. The level of control over the weapons of the former Soviet Union has been reduced. The level of control over fissionable material from which nuclear bombs can be made has also been reduced. With each passing year, the amount of fissionable material in the world increases. With each passing year, the resentment of the world\u2019s poor nations and cultures for the rich nations increases, as they realize that they will never catch up. With each passing year, the anger of Islamic\u00a0nations and cultures against Western culture grows. Terrorism is increasing.

Total collapse of industrial civilization inevitable with the exhaustion of fossil fuels by 2050 \u2013 continuing industrial civilization only means further destruction of the biosphere and extinction", "Caldwell, Economic Growth Supervisor with a PhD in Mathematical Statistics, 2003", "What The Economist article fails to point out is that what happens to small states when their national oil reserves run out is much the same as will happen to big states when global oil reserves run out. By the year 2050, global oil reserves will be exhausted, and industrial civilization will collapse worldwide. But there is a very significant \u2013 and very tragic \u2013 difference between the situation when small states run out of oil and when the world runs out of oil. When small states run out of oil, the population will simply return to what they did before, or they will migrate, or they will beg for food from the rest of the world. Life goes on, for them and the rest of the planet, pretty much as before. When the world runs out of oil, however, global human population will collapse and, unless a significant intervention occurs, the biosphere will have been destroyed by the petroleum age. As the energy inputs of oil (mechanization, irrigation, insecticides and other modern high-energy inputs) cease to flow, there will be a massive drop in global food production. World human population will drop from over six billion people to a few hundred million, since that is all that the current-solar-energy budget of the planet will support in the long term. The death of more than six billion people is not the real tragedy, however, since everyone must someday die. The great tragedy is that oil-fed global industrialization is destroying the biosphere \u2013 causing the extinction of an estimated 30,000 species a year. If industrial civilization continues until global oil supplies run out, what will remain will be a ruined planet, with far less biological diversity than before oil. Because of global warming, the petroleum age may even cause a greenhouse death of the planet, with the extinction of mankind along with all other large plant and animal species. Mankind is now in the process of causing the extinction of all kinds of large animals \u2013 tigers, rhinoceros, beluga sturgeon, pandas, apes, orangutans, lemurs, chimpanzees \u2013 just to name a few. When the petroleum age is over, many of these species will be gone \u2013 forever. When the world returns to a current-solar-energy-supported lifestyle, if mankind survives at all it will inhabit a desolate place, devoid of the wonderful variety of other large animals. Because of oil and global industrialization, African and Asian populations have exploded, and the current generation of Africans and Asians is now killing all of the other primates, to eat as \u201cbush meat,\u201d or to use their habitat for firewood or farmland, or to sell as pets to animal collectors or zoos in other parts of the world. When the industrial age is over and Africa and Asia return to a current-solar-energy lifestyle, they will find it a lonely place to be for the next several billion years. And who killed cock robin? It was the petroleum age, it was technology, it was industrialization, it was economic development \u2013 it was civilization that killed cock robin. A 100-year drunken binge of incredibly profligate production and consumption \u2013 made possible by the one-time windfall of fossil fuel -- will have caused the death of nature as we know it, as it evolved over billions of years.

Population projections from various sources suggest that, barring a major change of some kind, the population will continue to soar, to nine billion or more by the year 2050. In the past half-century \u2013 less than a lifetime -- the population of the US\u00a0has exploded from about 150 million to over 270 million. This explosive growth occurred despite the fact that fertility\u00a0rates in the US dropped to low levels \u2013 it is the result of uncontrolled immigration. The tremendous global population\u00a0increase has been brought about by the development of technology to utilize the energy\u00a0stored in fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Petroleum and gas reserves will be exhausted, however, by about 2050, and coal reserves will not last much beyond that date if industrial development continues to expand worldwide. Look around you. If you live in the US\u00a0or other economically developed country, every man-made thing you see or see happening is a product of the expenditure of energy, and most of that energy is derived from fossil fuels. To establish and maintain our present lifestyle requires prodigious amounts of energy \u2013 an amount equivalent to about 8,000 kilograms of oil\u00a0annually for each man, woman, and child living in the country. Pre-agricultural man lived \u201coff the land,\u201d consuming only the bounty of nature. Agricultural man could produce about 10 calories of energy with the expenditure of about one calorie of energy. Industrial man, it has been estimated, uses over ten calories of energy to produce a single calorie of food! The present system is not only exquisitely wasteful, but it is completely unsustainable. Most of what you see in the industrial world is a transitory illusion made possible by a one-time windfall supply of energy from fossil fuels that were accumulated over millions of years. When the fossil fuel reserves deplete in about 50 years, the modern world will simply disappear along with them. Whatever age you are, if you were raised in a town or a small city, go back to where you lived as a child and observe what has happened to the nearest natural field you played in. Chances are it is now urban sprawl \u2013 pavement, concrete, and steel. For each immigrant admitted to the US\u00a0\u2013 legal or illegal \u2013 about an acre of natural land is permanently destroyed, by roads, buildings, parking lots, houses, schools, and other structures that take the land out of production \u2013 both for wildlife and for agriculture. Last year the US admitted 1.2 million more immigrants. That represents the complete destruction of another .6 million acres of farmland, forest, and pastureland. Who cares? Certainly not the people in charge \u2013 they want more people because it makes more money, and they are not particularly concerned with the concomitant destruction of the environment! Industrial activity at the massive scale of the present is causing substantial changes to Earth\u2019s environment. By now, everyone knows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases produced by industrial activity is increasing substantially every year, and that the planet\u2019s climate and weather are controlled by these concentrations. Large-scale industrial activity is causing substantial changes to the planet\u2019s environment \u2013 land, air, water, and ecology. In view of the established relationship of the planet\u2019s climate and ecosystem to these concentrations, it is possible that man\u2019s industrial activity could cause dramatic changes in the sea level, and trigger another ice age or create a lifeless \u201chothouse.\u201d And for what good reason? What is the good purpose of burning all the planet\u2019s fossil fuels\u00a0as fast as possible, when it risks the destruction not only of mankind but of much other life on the planet as well? The answer is \u201cNone.\u201d This activity cannot continue at current levels without risking dire consequences, even apart from the issue of depletion of fossil fuel reserves and other nonrenewable resources. To continue to do so is the height of folly.

Already subjected to multiple human-induced stressors, most seriously overfishing, the resilience of the oceans and their consequent ability to adapt to change is decreasing. Yet it is this very resilience that scientists argue is vital if the oceans are to survive the onslaught of global climate change. Current threats The most immediate and significant threat to the oceans is overfishing. The demand for fish is exceeding the oceans\u2019 ecological limits with devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. Scientists are warning that overfishing results in profound changes in our oceans, perhaps permanently. Despite some alterations to the way fisheries are managed, there is little ground for optimism; 77% of all fish stocks are now either fully or over-exploited 1; fishermen are bringing home smaller and smaller catches despite technological advances; fish-size, abundance and genetic diversity has plummeted; high-value species are being replaced by so-called \u201ctrash\u201d fish; and habitat degradation is widespread and increasing2. Destructive practices and overfishing have diminished the sea\u2019s ability to renew its resources, with consequences for the more than one billion people in the world who rely on fish as their primary source of protein. The reality of modern fishing is an industrialisation that far outstrips nature\u2019s ability to replenish. Ships operate as floating factories, containing fish processing and packing plants, huge freezing systems and powerful engines to drag enormous fishing gear through the oceans \u2013 everything required to suck as much fish out of the oceans as quickly as possible and to despatch it for consumption. This wholesale damage and destruction is compounded by many other stressors exerted on the ocean from pollution to extraction. The cumulative result is that the resilience of the oceans \u2013 both individually and as a global network providing major services to the planet \u2013 is degenerating.  ", "", "(Christian Science Monitor, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, Staff Writer, \u201cHow Overfishing Can Alter An Entire Ecosystem,\u201d June 19, ) ", "Scientists have documented versions of this story around the world. Overfishing has shifted entire ecosystems with often surprising, and occasionally unpleasant, results. In the tropics, seaweed often dominates where coral once reigned. Around the world, jellyfish and algae proliferate where finfish previously dominated. With big predators often gone or greatly depleted, organisms lower on the food web grow more abundant, reducing their own prey in turn. Some say this is worrisome evidence of a greatly changed and simplified marine ecosystem. Like investment portfolios with few holdings, simple ecosystems are prone to collapse; and collapsed or rearranged ecosystems don\u2019t necessarily provide what humans expect. Increasingly mindful of marine ecosystems\u2019 complexity \u2013 and wary of their collapse \u2013 some people are calling for a holistic approach to managing ecosystems, one that aims to manage for the health of the entire system rather than that of a single stock. Just 4 percent of the world\u2019s oceans remains free from human impact, according to a 2008 study in the journal Science. Forty percent of this is heavily impacted.

Rev. 155, Winter)", "Declines in fishing stocks and the economic chaos that results when a fishery collapses have driven much of the interest in restoring the oceans - or at least in restoring the fishing stocks. Restoration efforts, however, depend on identifying the cause of the degradation. Although anthropogenic stresses to the oceans are many - pollution, destruction of habitat for coastal construction, and global warming - scientists consistently identify overfishing as the primary cause of \u00a0[*163]\u00a0 both depleted fisheries stocks and destruction of ecosystem biodiversity generally.  As for fishery stocks, more than two-thirds of the commercially fished stocks worldwide are currently either overfished or on the brink of becoming overfished.  Moreover, many commercially important stocks of marine species have suffered spectacular collapses, leaving economic chaos in their wakes. Some famous examples include salmon in the United States's Pacific Northwest;  cod in the northeastern United States, eastern Canada, and Scandinavia;  whales throughout the world;  and sea turtles in the Caribbean and Hawaii.  However, intensive fishing worldwide has also affected marine ecosystems more generally. In the fished stocks, \"fish diminish in size and number or disappear altogether.\"  When so reduced, these species cannot properly perform their roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, a condition known as ecological extinction.  Most directly, the reduction in number and size of commercially important species affects marine food webs: species that the overfished species consumed tend to increase in number, while species that consumed the overfished species tend to decrease in number  or shift their diets. When hunters came close to exterminating sea otters from the northern Pacific kelp forests, for example, the orcas that had formerly preyed on otter turned their attention to seals and sea lions, \"which are in drastic decline\" as a result.

Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the importance of the ocean to humanity's well-being: \"The ocean is the cradle of life on our planet, and it remains the axis of existence, the locus of planetary biodiversity, and the engine of the chemical and hydrological cycles that create and maintain our atmosphere and climate.\"  Ocean and coastal ecosystem services have been calculated to be worth over twenty billion dollars per year, worldwide.  In addition, many people assign heritage and existence value to the ocean and its creatures, viewing the world's seas as a common legacy to be passed on relatively intact to future generations.  Traditionally, land-bound humans have regarded the ocean as an inexhaustible resource and have pursued consumptive and extractive uses of the seas, such as fishing, with little thought of conservation.  In the last two or three centuries, however, humanity has overstressed the world's oceans, proving that the ocean's productivity is limited.  Degradation of the marine environment is becoming increasingly obvious: Scientists have mounting evidence of rapidly accelerating declines in once-abundant populations of cod, haddock, flounder, and scores of other \u00a0[*162]\u00a0 fish species, as well as mollusks, crustaceans, birds, and plants.

The new species, or \"posthuman,\" will likely view the old \"normal\" humans as inferior, even savages, and fit for slavery or slaughter. The normals, on the other hand, may see the posthumans as a threat and if they can, may engage in a preemptive strike by killing the posthumans before they themselves are killed or enslaved by them. It is ultimately this predictable potential for genocide that makes species-altering experiments potential weapons of mass destruction, and makes the unaccountable genetic engineer a potential bioterrorist. It is also why cloning and genetic modification is of species-wide concern and why an international treaty to address it is appropriate. 38 Such a treaty is necessary because existing laws on cloning and inheritable genetic alterations, although often well-intentioned, have serious limitations.", "\n", "Wang \u20181 (Andrea, J.D.

L. & POL'Y 165, L/N)", "Genetic diversity in humans helps to alleviate prejudice against out-groups because there is no one standard of \"normal.\" The remainder of this section shows that if the eugenic ends discussed above 161 come to fruition, we will become a more genetically homogenized society. Because of the expense, cloning will be utilized by the wealthy, dominant class and the stigmatizing effect will be felt by poorer, marginalized groups. 162 Thus, an increase in the use of cloning for genetic control will further solidify a societal definition of \"normalcy.\" As the class of \"normal\" becomes more and more narrow, parents who belong to out-groups may even choose, for the sake of their children, to have clones that will fit the societal definition of normalcy. 163 \"Individual choices are not made in a social vacuum, and unless changes in social attitudes keep pace with the proliferation of genetic tests, we can anticipate that many future prospective parents, acting to avoid misery for potential children, will have to bow to social attitudes they  [*186]  reject and resent.\" 164 Examples of minority group member parents who concede to the dominant culture because of perceived advantages for their children have come up in other areas of reproductive technology. For example, a black South African woman (with a white husband) who could not conceive with her eggs, requested that the egg donor be white. 165 She did so because she felt that a white child would have a better life than would a child of a mixed race. 166 The more this standard of \"normal\" is reinforced, the greater the psychological injury to members of out-groups. 167 In addition to the psychological injury of being deemed inferior as a function of genetic traits, is the concomitant discrimination at a societal level. Once certain traits are identified as desirable from a utilitarian and aesthetic framework, those who lack these traits will likely be discriminated against both in educational and employment settings. 168 Scientist Judith Swazey, in the context of \"genetic health,\" has articulated this concern: \"some of the uses of genetics reflect, and reinforce, a value system that contains an intolerance of \"imperfection.'\" 169 With a focus on an individual's genetic makeup, comes a shift to a greater acceptance of notions of biological determinism. 170 This theory provides the background for the justification of stereotype use and the resulting discrimination. Nelkin and Tancredi warn of the social power of biological information and speculate on its misuse: \"What is to be defined as normal or abnormal, able or disabled, healthy or diseased? And whose yardstick should prevail? ... We risk increasing the number of people defined as unemployable, uneducable,  [*187]  or uninsurable. We risk creating a biological underclass.\" 171 2. Biodiversity - Socio-Cultural Ramifications Genetic diversity, in addition to ameliorating the marginalization and oppression of out-groups, also benefits humans as a whole. Genetic diversity aids society through \"endowing people with physical and behavioral differences that enrich social interactions, political debates, literary works and music.\" 172 Such a cultural exchange has been deemed necessary for human survival: Each individual owes his survival and general well-being partly to his own limited assortment of characters and partly to the benefits received through cultural interchange with other individuals representing other assortments... Every man in a sense must become his brother's keeper, but the emphasis is on keeping and expanding what both hold in common, not on converting one brother to the ideal image held by the other. 173 The Rio Declaration, which emphasizes the intrinsic value of biodiversity, indicates the extent to which the international community recognizes these \"fruits\" as essential to the enjoyment of the right to life: The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, ... working towards international agreements which respect the interests of all and protect the integrity of the global environmental and developmental system, recognizing the integral and interdependent nature of the Earth, our home, proclaims that: ... States should cooperate to strengthen endogenous capacity-building for sustainable development by improving scientific understanding through exchanges of scientific and technological knowledge, and by enhancing the development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer of technologies, including new and innovative technologies. 174 Biodiversity as an essential component to the right to life 175 comes not only from the need for human consumption of biodiversity in non-human life forms (i.e. sources of nutritional, pharmaceutical, and  [*188]  agricultural resources), but also from a recognition of the value of diversity in the human population. 176 International environmental law has recognized biodiversity as intrinsically valuable. 177 The Council of Europe has linked this diversity with freedom: \"[because] a naturally occurring genetic recombination is likely to create more freedom for the human being than a predetermined genetic make up, it is in the interest of all persons to keep the essentially random nature of the composition of their own genes.\" 178 3. Biodiversity - Biological Advantages Even if one believes that a homogenous gene pool will not lead to tolerance problems or a loss of variation in cultural and technological innovations, one area where diversity does have an indisputable effect is in the genetic fitness of a population. 179 \"Genetic diversity within and among populations plays a key role in the health and development of the species.\" 180 This phenomenon has been demonstrated in nearly all forms of life. 181 Accordingly, \"preserving genetic diversity is important, because the prevalence of one particular genotype would make humans more susceptible to disease, rendering the species susceptible to the risk of extinction caused by a plague of global proportions.\" 182 As parents are able to exercise their genetic preference, and the genetic diversity of humans decreases, so too does the fitness of our population.", "\n", "Posthuman tech gives rise to eugenic authoritarianism ", "Lynn \u20181(Richard, Prof. Psychology at the Economic and Social Research Institute @ Ulster, \u201cEugenics: A Reassessment\u201d, p. 302-303, 306)", "Cloning could be used to considerable effect by authoritarian eugenic states as a means of reproducing their scientific, military, and political elites. As compared with embryo selection, one advantage of cloning is that a eugenic state could attempt to reproduce its elites immediately, with a fair chance of success. The cloning of elites would not require any knowledge of the genes and alleles responsible for intelligence or the complex set of personality traits necessary for creativity and high-level achievement, such as would be required before embryos selection could be used for eugenic purposes. All that cloning requires is the perfection of the techniques, and now that a number of mammals have been cloned, this should be relatively straightforward for humans. It has sometimes been objected that cloning has encountered a large number of failures before a success is achieved and that this rules out the cloning of humans. This objection is not persuasive because the eugenic state could afford a number of failures. In any case, technological progress in cloning is likely to reduce the failure rate. Eugenic states would be expected to confine cloning to the reproduction of quite small numbers of their scientific, military, and political elites. We cannot envision the scenario set out by Aldous Huxley (1932) in Brave New World in which the whole population was reproduced by cloning. For most of the population, embryo selection would be a preferable eugenic technique because it would enable nearly the whole population to have their own biological children with more desirable genetic combinations than those of either of their parents. This would retain the goodwill of the population more effectively than cloning the best individuals in each occupation and having them reared by adoptive parents. For the quite small numbers of its elites that eugenic states could be expected to reproduce by cloning, it would be necessary to find couples willing to rear the clone. In some cases, these would be the couples from one of whom the clone was taken. These couples would give the clones the advantages of their own knowledge and experience. Most of the clones would be reared by adoptive parents ho would be selected as likely to provide good rearing environments. Suitable women would have to be found who were willing to have the cloned embryos implanted, to carry them to term, and to rear them. This should not be a problem for the eugenic state. Only a few thousand children would be likely to be required for an elite cloning program. Sufficient numbers of women willing to bear and rear clones could probably be recruited as volunteers from enthusiasts for the eugenic program. If this proved not to be the case, they could be sufficiently well paid for this service to produce the required number of women. The cloning of elites would give eugenic states a large advantage over the Western democracies in the development of national economic, scientific, and military power. Important scientific advances are typically made by small numbers of highly gifted individuals who have hitherto appeared as a result of very unusual combinations of genes and favorable environmental conditions. Authoritarian eugenic states could produce hundreds or thousands of replicas of these highly gifted individuals by cloning and could have them reared in the most favorable family and educational environments. The cloning of political and military elites would make it possible for power to be transmitted from capable elites to their clones and would solve the succession problem that has so frequently led to the downfall of oligarchies. The cloning of elites would give authoritarian eugenic states considerable advantages because, as noted in Chapter 19, it cannot be envisioned that elites would be cloned in the Western democracies.He Continues\u2026In general terms, the situation is similar to that in the 1930s when nuclear physics had developed to the state at which it became feasible to construct an atom bomb. Once this point had been reached, it became inevitable that some country or countries would embark on a research program to make the bomb and would then use it, or threaten to use it, to gain a military advantage. In the event, it was the United States that developed the bomb and used it in 1945 to force Japan to surrender. For the next four years, until the Soviet Union developed the bomb, the United States was the only country to possess the atom bomb and could have used it to take control of the world. It was inevitable that it made no attempt to take advantage of this opportunity because in a democracy the internal opposition to an endeavor of this kind is too strong for it to be politically feasible. Authoritarian states are not constrained by internal opposition, which can easily be suppressed. An authoritarian eugenic state that used its genetically enhanced population to develop a decisive military advantage would be likely to use it to establish world domination.", "", "Rejecting racism is a moral imperative", "Memmi 2000 (Albert, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ U of Paris, Naiteire, Racism, transl.  Steve Martinot, p.  163-165, GAL)", "The struggle against racism will be long difficult without intermission, without remission, probably never achieved.  Yet for this very reason, it is a struggle to be undertaken without surcease and without concessions.  One cannot be indulgent toward racism; one must not even let the monster in the house, especially not in a mark.  To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other people, which is to diminish what is human.  To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to endorse fear, injustice and violence.  It is to accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely live.  It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim (and which [person] man is not [themselves] himself an outsider relative to someone else?).  Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is, it illuminates in a certain sense the entire human condition.  The anti-racist struggle, difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity.  In that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge. However, it remains true that one\u2019s moral conduct only emerges from a choice; one has to want it.  It is a choice among other choices and always debatable in its foundations and its consequences.  Let us say, broadly speaking, that the choice to conduct oneself morally is the condition for the establishment of a human order for which racism is the very negation.  This is almost a redundancy.  One cannot found a moral order, let alone a legislative order, on racism, because racism signifies the exclusion of the other and his or her subjection to violence and domination.  From an ethical point of view, if one can deploy a little religious language, racism is \u201cthe truly capital sin.\u201d  It is not an accident that almost all of humanity\u2019s spiritual traditions counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers.  It is not just a question of theoretical counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers.  It is not just a question of theoretical morality and disinterested commandments.  Such unanimity in the safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility of such sentiments.  All things considered, we have an interest in banishing injustice, because injustice engenders violence and death. Of course, this is debatable.  There are those who think that if one is strong enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible.  But no one is ever sure of remaining the strongest.  One day, perhaps, the roles will be reversed.  All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of its own death.  It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so that they treat you with respect.  \u201cRecall,\u201d says the bible \u201cthat you were once a stranger in Egypt,\u201d which means both that you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you risk becoming once again someday.  It is an ethical and practical appeal \u2013 indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it might be.  In short, the refusal of racism is the condition for all theoretical and practical morality.  Because, in the end, the ethical choice commands the political choice, a just society must be a society accepted by all.

The Strategic Defense Initiative, proposed by the Reagan administration, was an attempt to design such a shield against the threat of a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. But as Arthur C. Clarke, who was privy to discussions about the project, observed: \"Though it might be possible, at vast expense, to construct local defense systems that would 'only' let through a few percent of ballistic missiles, the much touted idea of a national umbrella was nonsense. Luis Alvarez, perhaps the greatest experimental physicist of this century, remarked to me that the advocates of such schemes were 'very bright guys with no common sense.'\" Clarke continued: \"Looking into my often cloudy crystal ball, I suspect that a total defense might indeed be possible in a century or so. But the technology involved would produce, as a by-product, weapons so terrible that no one would bother with anything as primitive as ballistic missiles.\"  InEngines of Creation, Eric Drexler proposed that we build an active nanotechnological shield - a form of immune system for the biosphere - to defend against dangerous replicators of all kinds that might escape from laboratories or otherwise be maliciously created. But the shield he proposed would itself be extremely dangerous - nothing could prevent it from developing autoimmune problems and attacking the biosphere itself.  Similar difficulties apply to the construction of shields against robotics and genetic engineering. These technologies are too powerful to be shielded against in the time frame of interest; even if it were possible to implement defensive shields, the side effects of their development would be at least as dangerous as the technologies we are trying to protect against. These possibilities are all thus either undesirable or unachievable or both.

Immortality, while perhaps the original, is certainly not the only possible utopian dream. I recently had the good fortune to meet the distinguished author and scholar Jacques Attali, whose bookLignes d'horizons (Millennium, in the English translation) helped inspire the Java and Jini approach to the coming age of pervasive computing, as previously described in this magazine. In his new bookFraternit\u00e9s, Attali describes how our dreams of utopia have changed over time: \"At the dawn of societies, men saw their passage on Earth as nothing more than a labyrinth of pain, at the end of which stood a door leading, via their death, to the company of gods and to Eternity. With the Hebrews and then the Greeks, some men dared free themselves from theological demands and dream of an ideal City where Liberty would flourish. Others, noting the evolution of the market society, understood that the liberty of some would entail the alienation of others, and they sought Equality.\" Jacques helped me understand how these three different utopian goals exist in tension in our society today. He goes on to describe a fourth utopia, Fraternity, whose foundation is altruism. Fraternity alone associates individual happiness with the happiness of others, affording the promise of self-sustainment. This crystallized for me my problem with Kurzweil's dream. A technological approach to Eternity - near immortality through robotics - may not be the most desirable utopia, and its pursuit brings clear dangers. Maybe we should rethink our utopian choices. Where can we look for a new ethical basis to set our course? I have found the ideas in the book Ethics for the New Millennium, by the Dalai Lama, to be very helpful. As is perhaps well known but little heeded, the Dalai Lama argues that the most important thing is for us to conduct our lives with love and compassion for others, and that our societies need to develop a stronger notion of universal responsibility and of our interdependency; he proposes a standard of positive ethical conduct for individuals and societies that seems consonant with Attali's Fraternity utopia. The Dalai Lama further argues that we must understand what it is that makes people happy, and acknowledge the strong evidence that neither material progress nor the pursuit of the power of knowledge is the key - that there are limits to what science and the scientific pursuit alone can do. Our Western notion of happiness seems to come from the Greeks, who defined it as \"the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope.\"  Clearly, we need to find meaningful challenges and sufficient scope in our lives if we are to be happy in whatever is to come. But I believe we must find alternative outlets for our creative forces, beyond the culture of perpetual economic growth; this growth has largely been a blessing for several hundred years, but it has not brought us unalloyed happiness, and we must now choose between the pursuit of unrestricted and undirected growth through science and technology and the clear accompanying dangers.", "", "", "", "", ""], "id": "76d7115c1ad97a68065e0dcbab19201343cdbab1e76bbe624bd549b49219df5c", "highlighted_text": "Blodgett 03 the next generation of heavy ion colliders may create mini black holes.

War could wipe out mankind. Not small wars, such as the scores of small conflicts that continue year after year. Not even big wars, such as the First and Second World Wars. But a really big war, involving thousands of nuclear weapons. That can make a real difference. Furthermore, it can bring an immediate halt to the high level of industrial activity that is destroying the planet. It can reduce human numbers to the point where they no longer have a significant Impact on the planet\u2019s ecology. The famous astronomer and writer Sir Fred Hoyle once observed that mankind will have only one chance to do something worthwhile with the energy from fossil fuel and the minerals at the Earth\u2019s surface: if it ends up destroying the planet it will never have a second chance. Global industrialization is causing the destruction that Hoyle referred to. Global nuclear war could bring that process to a halt. This section has identified a number of phenomena that might bring a halt to mankind\u2019s destruction of the biosphere. Some of them, such as asteroids or volcanoes, are beyond mankind\u2019s control, and their occurrence has nothing to do with its large numbers and high industrial production / energy use. Of the anthropogenic factors that might reduce mankind\u2019s destruction of the biosphere \u2013 famine, plague, and war \u2013 it appears that famine and plague would have little effect on stopping the mass species extinction. They may cause a temporary reduction in human numbers, but the population would rebound, and high levels of industrial production would continue, and damage to the biosphere would continue. The industrial nations of the world, which account for most of the global energy use, would likely continue in numbers and in industrial activity pretty much as before. These eventualities would do little to stop the destruction of the biosphere and the mass species extinction. But war is different. The main difference is not that it may reduce human numbers faster or to a greater degree than famine or plague, but that it can cause a catastrophic decrease in the level of industrial production, which is the major cause of environmental destruction. Also, it can occur at any time \u2013 it does not have to wait until fossil fuels run out, after many more species have been destroyed. It can occur tomorrow, and prevent the species loss that would otherwise occur over the last half century of the petroleum age. By reducing industrial activity by a large amount, it could reduce the current horrific rate of consumption of fossil fuels, leaving some for many future generations to take advantage of \u2013 to use for mankind\u2019s benefit, rather than for a few generations\u2019 mindless pleasure. (Of course, economics does not distinguish between production spent on war or video games or tourism or religion or art or philosophy, and the discounted \u201cpresent value\u201d of things in the far distant future is negligible, so this argument is of little consequence in today\u2019s world.)

Yet Sagan predicted \"the extinction of the human species \" as temperatures plummeted 35 degrees C and\u00a0 the world froze in the aftermath of\u00a0 a nuclear holocaust.\u00a0 Last year, Sagan's cohort tried\u00a0 to reanimate the ghost in a machine anti-nuclear activists invoked in the depths of the Cold War, by re-running equally arbitrary scenarios on a modern\u00a0 interactive Global Circulation Model. But the Cold War is history in more ways than one. It is a credit to post-modern computer climate simulations that  of what Sagan oxymoronically termed \"a sophisticated one dimensional model.\" The subzero 'baseline case'\u00a0 has melted down into a tepid 1.3 degrees of average cooling-. What remains is just not the stuff that\u00a0 End of the World myths are made of. It is hard to exaggerate\u00a0 how seriously \" nuclear winter \"was once taken by policy analysts who\u00a0 ought to\u00a0 have known better.

The workaround is to inject the imaginary aerosol at truly Himalayan elevations -\u00a0 pressure altitudes of 300 millibar and higher , where the\u00a0 computer model's vertical transport function modules pass it off to their even higher neighbors in the stratosphere , where it does not rain and particles linger..

The answer is simple- the modelers intervened.\u00a0 Turning off vertical transport algorithms\u00a0 may make Al Gore happy- he has bet on reviving the credibility Sagan's ersatz apocalypse , but there is no denying that in some of these scenarios human desire, not physical forces accounts for the vertical\u00a0 hoisting of\u00a0 millions of tons of mass ten vertical kilometers into the sky.to the level at which the models take over , with results at once predictable --and arbitrary.\u00a0 This is not physics, it is computer gamesmanship carried over to a new generation of\u00a0 X-Box.", "\n", "\n", "Nuclear war would not bring about the end of the world, though it would be horribly destructive. The truth is, many prominent physicists have condemned the nuclear winter hypothesis. Nobel laureate Freeman Dyson once said of nuclear winter research, \"It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight.\" Professor Michael McElroy, a Harvard physics professor, also criticized the nuclear winter hypothesis. McElroy said that nuclear winter researchers \"stacked the deck\" in their study, which was titled \"Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions\" (Science, December 1983). Nuclear winter is the theory that the mass use of nuclear weapons would create enough smoke and dust to blot out the sun, causing a catastrophic drop in global temperatures. According to Carl Sagan, in this situation the earth would freeze. No crops could be grown. Humanity would die of cold and starvation. In truth, natural disasters have frequently produced smoke and dust far greater than those expected from a nuclear war. In 1883 Krakatoa exploded with a blast equivalent to 10,000 one-megaton bombs, a detonation greater than the combined nuclear arsenals of planet earth. The Krakatoa explosion had negligible weather effects. Even more disastrous, going back many thousands of years, a meteor struck Quebec with the force of 17.5 million one-megaton bombs, creating a crater 63 kilometers in diameter. But the world did not freeze. Life on earth was not extinguished. Consider the views of Professor George Rathjens of MIT, a known antinuclear activist, who said, \"Nuclear winter is the worst example of misrepresentation of science to the public in my memory.\" Also consider Professor Russell Seitz, at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, who says that the nuclear winter hypothesis has been discredited. Two researchers, Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider, debunked the nuclear winter hypothesis in the summer 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs. Thompson and Schneider stated: \"the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishingly low level of probability.\"", "\n", "Thompson and Schneider, 1986", "The land surface temperature of the 30-50''N latitude zone for two cases having different assumed war durations, each of which produces a total of 60 million tons (teragrams. Tg) of smoke. The \"one-day\" war, allowing for some delay in fires, actually produces smoke over two days. The \"ten-day\" protracted war produces smoke continually over ten days, but at a lower rate than the one-day case. Despite the fact that smoke is continually being removed in each case, the slower rate of smoke input in the ten-day case actually worsens the climatic effects when compared to the faster war.", "Cosmos, Oct 13, 2008 \u201cnuclear autumn\u201d", "Overall, he and Alan Robock, also of Rutgers University, calculate that the average global temperature would dip by more than 1.1 \u00b0C and would stay below normal for a decade. Rainfall would also decline, by about 10 per cent.That might not sound like a large temperature change, but it's more than the cumulative effect of global warming since the dawn of industrial civilisation. It's enough, Robock says, to have a radical effect on growing seasons in regions like Europe and the American Midwest. Even countries that didn't participate in the war could see their growing seasons reduced by 10 to 30 days \u2013 a major factor because farmers wouldn't have planted the right crops for the new conditions. Even in the tropics, the change would strain agricultural productivity. \"This would not be nuclear winter,\" Robock said, \"but it would be a substantial disruption.\" ", "Their impact evidence assumes a 20 degree drop in temperature", "Life on Earth is exquisitely dependent on the climate (see Appendix A). The average surface temperature of the Earth\u2014 averaged, that is, over day and night, over the seasons, over latitude, over land and ocean, over coastline and continental interior, over mountain range and desert\u2014is about 13\u00b0C, 13 Centigrade degrees above the temperature at which fresh water freezes. (The corresponding temperature on the Fahrenheit scale is 55\u00b0F.) It's harder to change the temperature of the oceans than of the continents, which is why ocean temperatures are much more steadfast over the diurnal and seasonal cycles than are the temperatures in the middle of large continents. Any global temperature change implies much larger local temperature changes, if you don't live near the ocean. A prolonged global temperature drop of a few degrees C would be a disaster for agriculture; by 10\u00b0C, whole ecosystems would be imperiled; and by 20\u00b0C, almost all life on Earth would be at risk.* The margin of safety is thin.", "Chemical changes in the atmosphere won\u2019t cause a significant climate change", "Martin, 1982 (Brian, associate professor in Science, Technology and Society at the University of Wollongong, \u201cThe Global Health Effects of Nuclear War,\u201d Current Affairs, December 7, www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/82cab/index.html#explosive)", "", "Another possibility is that decreases in ozone or increases in oxides of nitrogen levels in the stratosphere, caused by nuclear war, could lead to climatic change. A reduction in ozone levels by a factor of two could cause a decrease in surface temperature of one half to one degree Centigrade, but including oxides of nitrogen in the calculation reduces this effect. Whether or not a change in temperature at the earth's surface by this amount for a few years could cause irreversible climatic change is hard to assess. The National Academy of Sciences study concluded that the effects of dust and oxides of nitrogen injection into the stratosphere 'would probably lie within normal global climatic variability, but the possibility of climatic changes of a more dramatic nature cannot be ruled out'.[39] Since the Academy assumed a nuclear war with the explosion of many more high-yield weapons than are presently deployed, the danger of climatic change from dust or oxides of nitrogen is almost certainly less than assessed in their report.", "Radioactivity doesn\u2019t affect the climate", "Your study predicts mass cooling. With all the heat and radioactivity of the explosions, why wouldn't nuclear war warm the planet? It has nothing to do with the radioactivity of the explosions \u2014 although that would be devastating to nearby populations. The explosions would set off massive fires, which would produce plumes of black smoke. The sun would heat the smoke and lift it into the stratosphere \u2014 that's the layer above the troposphere, where we live \u2014 where there is no rain to clear it out. It would be blown across the globe and block the sun. The effect would not be a nuclear winter, but it would be colder than the little ice age [in the 17th and 18th centuries] and the change would happen very rapidly \u2014 over the course of a few weeks. ", "And what would the results be for humanity? We calculated that there would be a shortening of the growing season in the mid-latitudes \u2014 that includes Europe and America in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 by a couple of weeks. The growing season is defined as the period between the last frost in spring and first frost in the fall. Some crops that need the whole growing season would not reach fruition and there would be no yield. Others would grow more slowly and produce a small yield. In addition there would be less precipitation and it would be darker, also damaging yield. You compound that with [the shutdown of] the current global network of food trading \u2014 countries would likely stop shipping food and focus on feeding their own populations \u2014 and it's a big crisis. We don't have the resources to do detailed analyses on the impacts of crops in different farming regimes but this suggests it could be a very serious problem.  How confident are you that your modeling is correct?  We used ModelE, designed by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and one of the models used to produce the results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The model does an excellent job of simulating climate change that resulted from volcanic eruptions in the past. That gave us confidence. What's more, a group repeated the calculations for the Pakistan-India scenario with a different model at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the results almost exactly agreed. Their research showed how the smoke from the fires would open up holes in the ozone, which would cause even more problems for humanity. We'd like other people to test the calculations with their models, but we're pretty confident that they'll get the same answer.  So we get a clue of the climatic effects of nuclear war from volcanic eruptions?  Yes. 1816 was known as the \"year without summer.\" It followed the Tambora Volcano eruption in Indonesia in 1815. It was sudden climate change on a similar scale, and it resulted in a severe famine in Europe, food riots and mass emigrations. Volcanic aerosols have a lifetime of about a year in the stratosphere. The lifetime of soot from nuclear fires is about five years. It's obviously much harder for a society to recover from such an extended cooling.

Because raging city firestorms are needed to inject huge amounts of smoke into the stratosphere and thus, according to one discredited theory, prevent almost all solar heat from reaching the ground, the Soviets changed their descriptions of how a modern city will burn if blasted by a nuclear explosion. Figure 1.6 pictures how Russian scientists and civil defense officials realistically described - before the invention of \"nuclear winter\" - the burning of a city hit by a nuclear weapon. Buildings in the blasted area for miles around ground zero will be reduced to scattered rubble - mostly of concrete, steel, and other nonflammable materials - that will not burn in blazing fires. Thus in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory translation (ORNL-TR-2793) of Civil Defense. Second Edition (500,000 copies), Moscow, 1970, by Egorov, Shlyakhov, and Alabin, we read: \"Fires do not occur in zones of complete destruction . . . that are characterized by an overpressure exceeding 0.5 kg/cm2 [- 7 psi]., because rubble is scattered and covers the burning structures.

In particular, we do not think that all environmental effects should once again be considered as \"secondary.\" Important environmental and widespread societal effects of nuclear war remain quite probable and do suggest further scientific and policy considerations. Our current understanding of environmental effects will be reviewed and then used to bolster arguments for strengthened strategic stability, not necessarily excluding newer strategic systems, but at significantly reduced levels of arsenals. It is reasonable to ask why the scientific basis of the theory of nuclear winter still provokes such divergent scientific opinions. The answer involves both the complexity of the problems and the severity of predicted effects. It is important to remember that the widespread radioactive fallout and ozone effects, although substantial, were never really thought by knowledgeable researchers to have a doomsday potential. In contrast, the original nuclear winter results showed truly catastrophic consequences arising from general war scenarios in the best available calculations. Thus, this new hypothesis could not be readily dismissed. Moreover, the problem of nuclear winter involves more scientific disciplines and more crucial areas of uncertainty than the earlier environmental problems. In particular, estimates of smoke production cannot be made from old nuclear test data and cannot be well bounded theoretically. Initially, the scientific basis of nuclear winter rested exclusively with the TTAPS group and their first calculations.'** After the original discovery that smoke could pose the most serious environmental threat of a nuclear war,\" the TTAPS group began to use a computer model to study the effects of war generated smoke and dust on the earth's climate. The model was one-dimensional; that is, it did not take into account north south and east-west directions, but instead treated the earth as a homogeneous all-land sphere having a temperature that depended only on the up-down direction (atmospheric altitude). Thus, the model had no geography, no winds, no seasons, instantaneous spread of smoke to the hemispheric scale, and no feedback of atmospheric circulation changes on the rate of smoke washout by rainfall. Despite these limitations, the TTAPS calculations did offer state-of-the-art estimates of the sunlight and infrared radiation absorption of a given amount of smoke and dust in a vertical column of the atmosphere.", "The theory that smoke from burning cities and forests and dust from nuclear explosions would cause worldwide freezing temperatures was conceived in 1982 by the German atmospheric chemist and environmentalist Paul Crutzen, and continues to be promoted by a worldwide propaganda campaign. This well funded campaign began in 1983 with televised scientific-political meetings in Cambridge and Washington featuring American and Russian scientists. A barrage of newspaper and magazine articles followed, including a scaremongering article by Carl Sagan in the October 30, 1983 issue of Parade, the Sunday tabloid read by millions. The most influential article was featured in the December 23,1983 issue of Science (the weekly magazine of the American Association for the Advancement of Science): \"Nuclear winter, global consequences of multiple nuclear explosions,\" by five scientists, R. P. Turco, O. B. Toon, T. P. Ackerman, J. B. Pollack, and C. Sagan. Significantly, these activists listed their names to spell TTAPS, pronounced \"taps,\" the bugle call proclaiming \"lights out\" or the end of a military funeral.Until 1985, non-propagandizing scientists did not begin to effectively refute the numerous errors, unrealistic assumptions, and computer modeling weakness' of the TTAPS and related \"nuclear winter\" hypotheses. A principal reason is that government organizations, private corporations, and most scientists generally avoid getting involved in political controversies, or making statements likely to enable antinuclear activists to accuse them of minimizing nuclear war dangers, thus undermining hopes for peace. Stephen Schneider has been called a fascist by some disarmament supporters for having written \"Nuclear Winter Reappraised,\" according to the Rocky Mountain News of July 6, 1986. Three days later, this paper, that until recently featured accounts of unsurvivable \"nuclear winter,\" criticized Carl Sagan and defended Thompson and Schneider in its lead editorial, \"In Study of Nuclear Winter, Let Scientists Be Scientists.\" In a free country, truth will out - although sometimes too late to effectively counter fast-hitting propaganda. Effective refutation of \"nuclear winter\" also was delayed by the prestige of politicians and of politically motivated scientists and scientific organizations endorsing the TTAPS forecast of worldwide doom. Furthermore, the weakness' in the TTAPS hypothesis could not be effectively explored until adequate Government funding was made available to cover costs of lengthy, expensive studies, including improved computer modeling of interrelated, poorly understood meteorological phenomena.", "\n ", "Johnston \u20183 /Wm.

For the purposes of illustration it is assumed that a war resulted in mid-1988 from military conflict between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. This is in some ways a worst-case scenario (total numbers of strategic warheads deployed by the superpowers peaked about this time; the scenario implies a greater level of military readiness; and impact on global climate and crop yields are greatest for a war in August). Some details, such as the time of attack, the events leading to war, and the winds affecting fallout patterns, are only meant to be illustrative. This applies also to the global geopolitical aftermath, which represents the author's efforts at intelligent speculation.  There is much public misconception concerning the physical effects of nuclear war--some of it motivated by politics. Certainly the predictions described here are uncertain: for example, casualty figures in the U.S. are accurate perhaps to within 30% for the first few days, but the number of survivors in the U.S. after one year could differ from these figures by as much as a factor of four. Nonetheless, there is no reasonable basis for expecting results radically different from this description--for example, there is no scientific basis for expecting the extinction of the human species. Note that the most severe predictions concerning nuclear winter have now been evaluated and discounted by most of the scientific community.  Sources supplying the basis for this description include the U.S. Defense Nuclear Agency manual on nuclear weapon effects, scientific papers describing computer simulations of long-term effects published by groups ranging from the U.S. government to left-leaning scientific organizations, and research by a similar variety of groups on weapons characteristics and strategy.  ", "\n", "Rather than \"higher standards of evidence,\" Mr. Sagan merely provided testimonials.  He had sent return mail questionnaires to the nearly 100 participants at the April meeting, and edited the replies down to his favorite two-dozen quotations.  What became of the hard copy of the less enthusiastic reports remains a mystery, but it is evident from subsequent comments by their authors that TTAPS received less than the unanimous endorsement of \"a large number of scientists.\"  Prof. Victor Weisskopf of MIT, sized up the matter in early 1984:  \"Ah! Nuclear Winter!  The science is terrible, but, perhaps the psychology is good.\"  Many scientists were reluctant to speak out, perhaps for fear of being denounced as reactionaries or closet Strangeloves.  For example, physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton was privately critical in early 1984.  As he put it, \"It's (TTAPS) an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight....Who wants to be accused of being in favor of nuclear war?\" Most of the intellectual tools necessary to demolish TTAPS's bleak vision were already around then, but not the will to use them.  From respected scientists one heard this:  \"You know, I really don't think these guys know what they're talking about\" (Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman); \"They stacked the deck\" (Prof. Michael McElroy, Harvard); and, after a journalist's caution against four-letter words, \"'Humbug' is six [letters]\" (Prof. Jonathan Katz, Washington University). In 1985, a series of unheralded and completely unpublicized studies started to appear in learned journals -- studies that, piece by piece, started to fill in the blanks in the climate-modeling process that had previously been patched over with \"educated\" guesses. The result was straightforward:  As the science progressed and more authentic sophistication was achieved in newer and more elegant models, the postulated effects headed downhill.  By 1986, these worst-case effects had melted down from a year of arctic darkness to warmer temperatures than the cool months in Palm Beach!  A new paradigm of broken clouds and cool spots had emerged.  The once global hard frost had retreated back to the northern tundra.  Mr. Sagan's elaborate conjecture had fallen prey to Murphy's lesser known Second Law:  If everything MUST go wrong, don't bet on it. By June 1986 it was over:  In the Summer 1986 Foreign Affairs, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) scientists Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider declared, \"...on scientific grounds the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishingly low level of probability.\" Yet the activist wing of the international scientific establishment had already announced the results of the first generations of interdisciplinary ecological and climatological studies based on Nuclear Winter.  Journalists paid more attention to the press releases than the substance of these already obsolescent efforts at ecological modeling, and proceeded to inform the public that things were looking worse than ever.  Bold headlines carried casualty estimates that ran into the proverbial \"billions and billions.\"  This process culminated in the reception given the 1985 report of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).  Stressing the uncertainties that plagued the calculations then and now, it scrupulously excluded the expression \"Nuclear Winter\" from its 193 pages of sober text, but the report's press release was prefaced \"Nuclear Winter...'Clear Possibility.'\"  Mr. Sagan construed the reports to constitute an endorsement of the theory.  But in February 1986, NCAR's Dr. Schneider quietly informed a gathering at the NASA-Ames Laboratory that Nuclear Winter had succumbed to scientific progress and that, \"in a severe\" 6,500-megaton strategic exchange, \"The Day After\" might witness July temperatures upwards of 50- plus degrees Fahrenheit in mid-America.  The depths of Nuclear Winter could no longer easily be distinguished from the coolest days of summer.", "Nuclear winter\u2019s discredited \u2013 all real scientists call it nuclear autumn", "\u00b0 Myth: Unsurvivable \"nuclear winter\" surely will follow a nuclear war. The world will be frozen if only 100 megatons (less than one percent of all nuclear weapons) are used to ignite cities. World-enveloping smoke from fires and the dust from surface bursts will prevent almost all sunlight and solar heat from reaching the earth's surface. Universal darkness for weeks! Sub-zero temperatures, even in summertime! Frozen crops, even in the jungles of South America! Worldwide famine! Whole species of animals and plants exterminated! The survival of mankind in doubt! \u00b0 Facts: Unsurvivable \"nuclear winter\" is a discredited theory that, since its conception in 1982, has been used to frighten additional millions into believing that trying to survive a nuclear war is a waste of effort and resources, and that only by ridding the world of almost all nuclear weapons do we have a chance of surviving. Non-propagandizing scientists recently have calculated that the climatic and other environmental effects of even an all-out nuclear war would be much less severe than the catastrophic effects repeatedly publicized by popular astronomer Carl Sagan and his fellow activist scientists, and by all the involved Soviet scientists. Conclusions reached from these recent, realistic calculations are summarized in an article, \"Nuclear Winter Reappraised\", featured in the 1986 summer issue of Foreign Affairs, the prestigious quarterly of the Council on Foreign Relations. The authors, Starley L. Thompson and Stephen H. Schneider, are atmospheric scientists with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They showed \" that on scientific grounds the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishing low level of probability.\" Their models indicate that in July (when the greatest temperature reductions would result) the average temperature in the United States would be reduced for a few days from about 70 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 50 degrees. (In contrast, under the same conditions Carl Sagan, his associates, and the Russian scientists predicted a resulting average temperature of about 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, lasting for many weeks!)", "\n", "Given a plausible war scenario, perhaps the single most uncertain area of the nuclear winter problem is the determination of how much smoke would be produced, how \"black\" the smoke would be, and how much would be rained out immediately. Studies are in progress now to narrow these uncertainties. One recent estimate indicates that the amount of smoke initially produced in a major nuclear war may have been overestimated by roughly a factor of two to four in the NAS report.'*^' The blackness of the smoke (determined by the percentage of black carbon soot in the smoke), however, can be just as important as the amount of smoke in determining atmospheric effects. Indeed, an effective amount of smoke can be defined as the product of the total amount of smoke and the smoke blackness. It is possible that current appraisals underestimate the blackness of typical smoke from urban fires. This potential error could substantially compensate for a downward revision in estimates of total smoke produced. Potential rainout of smoke near the fires (like the \"black rain\" that followed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the subsequent conflagration) controls the amount of smoke that can eventually spread and cause climatic effects. The estimates of rapid rainout of smoke in large thunderstorms associated with city fires are very problematic, but ambitious recent calculations indicate that even under ideal rainout conditions a substantial amount of smoke would probably remain in the atmosphere. ^\"^ State-of-the-art assessments of the climatic effects of nuclear winter are based on results from fully three-dimensional models that simulate the evolving patterns of global weather on an earth having realistic geography.^^ The simulations recently performed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have used a model which resolves the atmosphere from the surface to about 30 kilometers altitude (the middle stratosphere) and which resolves geographic features at about 5\u00b0 latitude by 7\u00b0 longitude resolution.^'* The model includes transport by winds, removal of particles from the atmosphere by rainfall and other processes, and detailed calculations of sunlight transmission and infrared \"greenhouse\" effects\u2014all for both smoke and dust, although smoke is by far the larger contributor to climatic effects. In contrast, recall that the TTAPS calculations had no geographic resolution, and hence could not adequately predict the global spread or removal of smoke from the atmosphere. Of course, even the most sophisticated models include simplifying internal assumptions; thus we anticipate that present quantitative results will change somewhat as improvements continue to be made. In the recent NCAR research, we have not adopted any particular detailed war scenario other than the obvious assumption that the smoke and dust would come from the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries.^^ In fact, there is no general consensus on the amount and blackness of smoke that would exist in the atmosphere a few days after the start of a major nuclear exchange like the 6,500-megaton war the NAS study used as a baseline. Given this large range of uncertainty, we have used three different amounts of moderately black smoke\u201420, 60 and 180 million tons\u2014to bracket what is currently thought to be a reasonable range of smoke amount and blackness for a large nuclear war. It should be pointed out that the NAS baseline smoke amount estimate (180 million tons) now appears to lie closer to the plausible upper limit of effective smoke amount than it once was thought to. The war is assumed to take place during a typical day in July, with smoke generated for the first two days.^ The land surface temperatures produced by the three smoke cases are shown in Figure 1. This figure shows that the average temperature changes for the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes are considerably smaller than the original estimates of one-dimensional models, and are about two-thirds of the temperature changes found in our original three-dimensional calculations. These temperature changes more closely describe a nuclear \"fall\" than a nuclear winter. The reasons for the moderation of temperature compared to the original calculations are well understood: first, the oceans have a large heat capacity, which ameliorates the cooling over land. Second, about three-fourths of the smoke is removed from the model's atmosphere over the course of 30 days. Third, the infrared \"greenhouse\" effect of the smoke, which was not included in earlier three-dimensional models, does produce a significant mitigation of the surface cooling.^^ We must stress that our results are for July, the month in which the temperature changes are likely to be largest. Similar calculations for January show much less effect simply because at that time it is already winter in the northern hemisphere.", "\n", "Newest research proves soot clouds would be outweighed by co2 from burning stuff", "Just when you might have thought it was ethically sound to unleash a nuclear attack on a nearby city, along comes a pesky scientist and points out that atomic warfare is bad for the climate. According to a  in the journal  & Environmental Science, even a very limited nuclear exchange, using just a thousandth of the weaponry of a full-scale nuclear war, would cause up to 690m tonnes of CO2 to enter the atmosphere \u2013 more than UK's annual total. The upside (kind of) is that the conflict would also generate as much as 313m tonnes of soot. This would stop a great deal of sunlight reaching the earth, creating a significant regional cooling effect in the short and medium terms \u2013 just like when a major volcano erupts. Ultimately, though, the CO2 would win out and crank up global temperatures an extra few notches. The paper's author, Mark Z Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, calculated the emissions of such a conflict by totting up the burn rate and carbon content of the fabric of our cities. \"Materials have the following carbon contents: plastics, 38\u201392%; tyres and other rubbers, 59\u201391%; synthetic fibres, 63\u201386%; woody biomass, 41\u201345%; charcoal, 71%; asphalt, 80%; steel, 0.05\u20132%. We approximate roughly the carbon content of all combustible material in a city as 40\u201360%.\"", "The explosion of fifty 15 kt nuclear devices (a total of 1.5 MT, or 0.1% of the yields proposed for a full-scale nuclear war) during a limited nuclear exchange in megacities could burn 63\u2013313 Tg of fuel, adding 1\u20135 Tg of soot to the atmosphere, much of it to the stratosphere, and killing 2.6\u201316.7 million people. The soot emissions would cause significant short- and medium-term regional cooling. Despite short-term cooling, the CO2 emissions would cause long-term warming, as they do with biomass burning. The CO2 emissions from such a conflict are estimated here from the fuel burn rate and the carbon content of fuels. Materials have the following carbon contents: plastics, 38\u201392%; tires and other rubbers, 59\u201391%; synthetic fibers, 63\u201386%; woody biomass, 41\u201345%; charcoal, 71%; asphalt, 80%; steel, 0.05\u20132%. We approximate roughly the carbon content of all combustible material in a city as 40\u201360%. Applying these percentages to the fuel burn gives CO2 emissions during an exchange as 92\u2013690 Tg CO2. The annual electricity production due to nuclear energy in 2005 was 2768 TWh yr\u22121. If one nuclear exchange as described above occurs over the next 30 yr, the net carbon emissions due to nuclear weapons proliferation caused by the expansion of nuclear energy worldwide would be 1.1\u20134.1 g CO2 kWh\u22121, where the energy generation assumed is the annual 2005 generation for nuclear power multiplied by the number of yr being considered. This emission rate depends on the probability of a nuclear exchange over a given period and the strengths of nuclear devices used. Here, we bound the probability of the event occurring over 30 yr as between 0 and 1 to give the range of possible emissions for one such event as 0 to 4.1 g CO2 kWh\u22121.

Many disciplines deem a two order of magnitude crack-up grounds for publishing a retraction- not this one - instead we are seeing stonewalling in defense of the original exercise in semantic aggression.

Toon says most of the huge US and Russian nuclear warheads are aimed, in a first strike, at missile silos in wilderness or suburban military installations. There is not much to burn, and after the first warhead hits, subsequent explosions do not release much additional smoke. Urban firestorm By contrast, a regional exchange where adversaries target each others' megacities would ignite huge urban firestorms. Toon calculates the smoke released per kilotonne of explosive yield would be 100 times greater than in the Cold War scenarios.", "", "Thompson and Schneider \u201886", "If one accepts the idea of a threshold for nuclear winter for the sake of strategic argument, then the question of how to quantify it becomes important. Given the substantial uncertainties in defining a threshold, and the potentially grave consequences of exceeding it, the argument was made for deriving a threshold based on a worst-case smoke-producing assumption of targeting. Taken in this light, the strategically dubious \"100- megaton war\" can be seen as a worst-case assumption serving to delineate a prudent threshold. The 100-megaton scenario used 1,000 warheads, but it was never suggested that the threshold would be very well defined. For example, in his Foreign Affairs article, Sagan set a crude threshold of around 500 to 2,000 warheads, primarily attributing the uncertainty to assumptions of targeting and weapon yields. Ironically, just when the strategic implications of the threshold concept were starting to be debated in the strategic policy community, the strongest scientific arguments against the concept emerged. To understand why the threshold concept is not scientifically persuasive, one must be aware of the limitations inherent in the models that do not take account of geography. It is tempting to interpret a calculation in which surface temperature is represented as a single global number in terms of a dramatic physical threshold, e.g., the freezing point. But such calculations cannot capture the true geographical and seasonal heterogeneity of climate. A global model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research studied the inclusion of north-south and east-west dimensions and how such improvements would modify the results of one-dimensional models.'^ We found that the oceans, with their vast storage of heat, would reduce the magnitude of average continental cooling by a factor of two in the summer, compared to the cooling calculated by assuming a land-covered planet. The estimated cooling effect in winter was smaller by a factor of ten than the TTAPS annual estimate, because northern hemisphere midlatitude land areas are already cold in winter. Even when we assumed a uniform smoke cloud to exist over the middle part of the northern hemisphere, the surface temperature reduction was unevenly distributed\u2014much less along western coasts and even more than one-dimensional mode! results in some midcontinental cold-weather fluctuations in summertime. In short, simulations using geographically realistic models produced such a wide range of consequences for any given war scenario that it became clear that the elegant and strategically compelling idea of a threshold was an artifact of a simplified model. \" This observation remains true.

We find column ozone losses in excess of 20% globally, 25\u201345% at midlatitudes, and 50\u201370% at northern high latitudes persisting for 5 years, with substantial losses continuing for 5 additional years. Column ozone amounts remain near or <220 Dobson units at all latitudes even after three years, constituting an extratropical \u201cozone hole.\u201d The resulting increases in UV radiation could impact the biota significantly, including serious consequences for human health. The primary cause for the dramatic and persistent ozone depletion is heating of the stratosphere by smoke, which strongly absorbs solar radiation. The smoke-laden air rises to the upper stratosphere, where removal mechanisms are slow, so that much of the stratosphere is ultimately heated by the localized smoke injections. Higher stratospheric temperatures accelerate catalytic reaction cycles, particularly those of odd-nitrogen, which destroy ozone. In addition, the strong convection created by rising smoke plumes alters the stratospheric circulation, redistributing ozone and the sources of ozone-depleting gases, including N2O and chlorofluorocarbons. The ozone losses predicted here are significantly greater than previous \u201cnuclear winter/UV spring\u201d calculations, which did not adequately represent stratospheric plume rise. Our results point to previously unrecognized mechanisms for stratospheric ozone depletion.", "\u00b0 Myth: Blindness and a disastrous increase of cancers would be the fate of survivors of a nuclear war, because the nuclear explosions would destroy so much of the protective ozone in the stratosphere that far too much ultraviolet light would reach the earth's surface. Even birds and insects would be blinded. People could not work outdoors in daytime for years without dark glasses, and would have to wear protective clothing to prevent incapacitating sunburn. Plants would be badly injured and food production greatly reduced.\u00b0 Facts: Large nuclear explosions do inject huge amounts of nitrogen oxides (gasses that destroy ozone) into the stratosphere. However, the percent of the stratospheric ozone destroyed by a given amount of nitrogen oxides has been greatly overestimated in almost all theoretical calculations and models. For example, the Soviet and U.S. atmospheric nuclear test explosions of large weapons in 1952-1962 were calculated by Foley and Ruderman to result in a reduction of more than 10 percent in total ozone. (See M. H. Foley and M. A. Ruderman, 'Stratospheric NO from Past Nuclear Explosions\", Journal of Geophysics, Res. 78, 4441-4450.) Yet observations that they cited showed no reductions in ozone. Nor did ultraviolet increase. Other theoreticians calculated sizable reductions in total ozone, but interpreted the observational data to indicate either no reduction, or much smaller reductions than their calculated ones.", "If significant ozone reduction did occur, the most important direct effect on humans would be an increase in skin cancer. However, this is seldom lethal, and could be avoided by reducing exposure to sunlight. Potentially more serious would be effects on crops.[32] Some of the important grains, for example, are sensitive to uv. Whether the net effects on crop yields would be significant is hard to estimate. But whatever the reduction in ozone, ozone levels would return pretty much to normal after a few years.[9] It seems unlikely that in the context of a major nuclear war the changes in uv alone would be of serious concern. In particular, the threat of human extinction raised by Jonathan Schell in The Fate of the Earth,[33] based mostly on effects of increased uv from ozone reduction, seems very small indeed. It is sometimes claimed that nuclear war could destroy ozone to such an extent that humans and animals would be blinded by excess uv. Even if large numbers of high-yield weapons were exploded, this possibility seems very unlikely except for a contribution to snow blindness in the far north. Stratospheric ozone can never be completely removed, but at most reduced greatly. Even if a 50 per cent or more reduction in ozone occurred - and as noted this seems improbable with present nuclear arsenals - protection from uv for humans could be obtained from sunglasses or just ordinary glasses, which absorb uv. For animals, the following considerations are relevant. Ozone levels vary considerably from place to place and from time to time, both seasonally and daily (sometimes by up to 50 per cent). Sunlight at the equator typically passes through only half as much ozone as at the mid-latitudes, yet animals at the equator are not known to go blind more often than elsewhere. Furthermore, most ozone reductions from a nuclear war would be in the mid and high latitudes, where ozone levels are higher to start with and where the 'path length' of sunlight through ozone is increased due to its oblique angle of incidence. But this does not mean complacency is warranted, as the concerns of John Hampson illustrate.", "", "A realistic simplified estimate of the increased ultraviolet light dangers to American survivors of a large nuclear war equates these hazards to moving from San Francisco to sea level at the equator, where the sea level incidence of skin cancers (seldom fatal) is highest- about 10 times higher than the incidence at San Francisco. Many additional thousands of American survivors might get skin cancer, but little or no increase in skin cancers might result if in the post-attack world deliberate sun tanning and going around hatless went out of fashion. Furthermore, almost all of today's warheads are smaller than those exploded in the large- weapons tests mentioned above; most would inject much smaller amounts of ozone-destroying gasses, or no gasses, into the stratosphere, where ozone deficiencies may persist for years. And nuclear weapons smaller than 500 kilotons result in increases (due to smog reactions) in upper tropospheric ozone.

Only one large-scale field survey of Anarctic phytoplankton has been carried out so far [Smith et.al _Science_1992] ; they found a 6-12% drop in phytoplankton productivity once their ship entered the area of the spring-time ozone hole. Since the hole only lasts from 10-12weeks this translates into a 2-4% loss overall, a measurable but not yet catastrophic loss. Both plants and phytoplankton vary widely in their sensitivity to UV-B. When over 200 agricultural plants were tested, more than half showed sensitivity to UV-B light. Other plants showed neglible effects or even a small increase in vigor.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, scares about stratospheric ozone developed, culminating in 1982 in the release of Jonathan Schell's book The Fate of the Earth.[4] Schell painted a picture of human annihilation from nuclear war based almost entirely on effects from increased ultraviolet light at the earth's surface due to ozone reductions caused by nuclear explosions. Schell's book was greeted with adulation rarely observed in any field. Yet by the time the book was published, the scientific basis for ozone-based nuclear extinction had almost entirely evaporated. The ongoing switch by the military forces of the United States and the Soviet Union from multi-megatonne nuclear weapons to larger numbers of smaller weapons means that the effect on ozone from even the largest nuclear war is unlikely to lead to any major effect on human population levels, and extinction from ozone reductions is virtually out of the question.[3]", "Ultraviolet levels are over 1,000 times higher at the equator than at the polar regions so it is presumed that marine life at the equator is much better adapted to the higher environmental UV light than organisms in the polar regions.

New research confirms a theory that plankton can indirectly create clouds that block some of the Sun's harmful UV rays. The study was conducted by Dierdre Toole of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and David Siegel of the University of California (UCSB).  The study found that when the Sun beats down on the top layer of ocean where plankton live, harmful rays in the form of ultraviolet (UV) radiation bother the little plants. When they are stressed, plankton try to protect themselves by producing a compound called dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Though no one knows for sure, some scientists believe DMSP helps strengthen the plankton's cell walls. This chemical gets broken down in the water by bacteria, and it changes into another substance called dimethylsulfide (DMS). DMS then filters from the ocean into the air, where it reacts with oxygen, to form different sulfur compounds. Sulfur in the DMS sticks together in the air and creates tiny dust-like particles. These particles are just the right size for water to condense on, which is the beginning of how clouds are formed. So, indirectly, plankton help create more clouds, and more clouds mean less direct light reaches the ocean surface. This relieves the stress put on plankton by the Sun's UV rays. ", "DMS levels peak from June through the end of September. During the season, the study found that a whopping 77 percent of the changes in amounts of DMS were due to exposure to UV radiation. \"For someone studying marine biology and ecology, this type of variation is absolutely incredible,\" Siegel said. The researchers were also surprised to find that the DMS molecules completely refresh themselves after only three to five days. That means the plankton may react to UV rays quickly enough to impact their own weather. Toole and Siegel were surprised by the lightning-fast rate of turnover for DMS. To give an example for comparison, when carbon dioxide gets into the atmosphere where it acts as a greenhouse gas and traps heat, it may last for decades. Toole adds that the cycles that break down DMS scream along at these very fast rates, even though overall amounts over the course of the year remain pretty stable with a slow increase over summer and a gradual decline over winter. ", "It is not serious at all. While the Antarctic ozone hole is genuine and will continue as a temporary thinning of the layer every October, it has stabilized and may diminish in the future. Ozone depletion at our latitudes has been less than five percent and has stopped altogether since 1992. The depletion is small in relation to the natural fluctuations, which can reach some 100 percent from day to day. No steady increase of average solar ultraviolet radiation has been measured on the ground so far.  But even if it did increase, a ten percent increase would correspond in exposure to moving about 100 miles towards the equator. UV exposures in Florida are some 200 to 300 percent greater than in New York.

We find column ozone losses in excess of 20% globally, 25\u201345% at midlatitudes, and 50\u201370% at northern high latitudes persisting for 5 years, with substantial losses continuing for 5 additional years. Column ozone amounts remain near or <220 Dobson units at all latitudes even after three years, constituting an extratropical \u201cozone hole.\u201d The resulting increases in UV radiation could impact the biota significantly, including serious consequences for human health. The primary cause for the dramatic and persistent ozone depletion is heating of the stratosphere by smoke, which strongly absorbs solar radiation. The smoke-laden air rises to the upper stratosphere, where removal mechanisms are slow, so that much of the stratosphere is ultimately heated by the localized smoke injections. Higher stratospheric temperatures accelerate catalytic reaction cycles, particularly those of odd-nitrogen, which destroy ozone. In addition, the strong convection created by rising smoke plumes alters the stratospheric circulation, redistributing ozone and the sources of ozone-depleting gases, including N2O and chlorofluorocarbons. The ozone losses predicted here are significantly greater than previous \u201cnuclear winter/UV spring\u201d calculations, which did not adequately represent stratospheric plume rise. Our results point to previously unrecognized mechanisms for stratospheric ozone depletion. ", "Aftermath Michael Mills from the University of Colorado reckons that such a nuclear war in South Asia would decay about 40 percent of the ozone layer in the middle latitudes and 70 percent in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. \"The models show this magnitude of ozone loss would persist for five years, and we would see substantial losses continuing for at least another five years,\" says Mills. Mills extracted his results from computer models.Previous models were created during the 1980s, however those investigations revealed that impact of the nuclear detonations would be much more moderate. This might be because the old models do not take into consideration the columns of soot rising at altitudes of 80 kilometers into Earth's atmosphere, as Mills considers. Once the soot is released into the upper atmosphere, it would block and absorb most of the solar energy, thus determining a heating of the surrounding atmosphere, process that facilitates the reaction between nitrogen oxides and ozone", "", "Spiegel, 11/23/2007 ", "The more recent meltdown at the reactor in Chernobyl in 1986 reminded the world of the dangers of the atom. The incident was referred to as \"nuclear genocide,\" and the press wrote of \"forests stained red\" and of deformed insects. The public was bombarded with images of Soviet cleanup crews wearing protective suits, bald-headed children with cancer and the members of cement crews who lost their lives in an attempt to seal off the cracked reactor with a concrete plug. Fifteen years after the reactor accident, the German newsmagazine Focus concluded that Chernobyl was responsible for \"500,000\" deaths. Was all this just doomsday folklore? There is no doubt that large sections of the countryside were contaminated by the accident in the Ukraine. In the ensuing decades, up to 4,000 cleanup workers and residents of the more highly contaminated areas died of the long-term consequences of radiation exposure. But the six-figure death counts that opponents of nuclear power once cited are simply nonsense. In most cases, they were derived from vague \"extrapolations\" based on the hearsay reported by Russian dissidents. But such horror stories have remained part of the nuclear narrative to this day.  In fact, contemporaries who reported on the Chernobyl incident should have known better. Even in the 1980s, radiobiologists and radiation physicists considered the media's doomsday reports to be exaggerated. And their suspicions have become a virtual certainty today. Groups of researchers have set up shop at all of the sites of nuclear accidents or major nuclear contamination. They work at Hanford (where the United States began producing plutonium in 1944), they conduct studies in the English town of Sellafield (where a contaminated cloud escaped from the chimney in 1957), and they study the fates of former East German uranium mineworkers in the states of Saxony and Thuringia. New mortality rates have now been compiled for all of these groups of individuals at risk. Surprisingly, the highest mortality rates were found among the East German mineworkers. In Hiroshima, on the other hand, radioactivity claimed surprisingly few human lives. Experts now know exactly what happened in the first hours, days and weeks after the devastating atomic explosion. Almost all of Hiroshima's 140,000 victims died quickly. Either they were crushed immediately by the shock wave, or they died within the next few days of acute burns. But the notorious radiation sickness -- a gradual ailment that leads to certain death for anyone exposed to radiation levels of 6 Gray or higher -- was rare. The reason is that Little Boy simply did not produce enough radioactivity. But what about the long-term consequences? Didn't the radiation work like a time bomb in the body? To answer these questions, the Japanese and the Americans launched a giant epidemiological study after the war. The study included all residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who had survived the atomic explosion within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius. Investigators questioned the residents to obtain their precise locations when the bomb exploded, and used this information to calculate a personal radiation dose for each resident. Data was collected for [eighty six thousand] 86,572 people. Today, 60 years later, the study's results are clear. More than 700 people eventually died as a result of radiation received from the atomic attack: 87 died of leukemia; 440 died of tumors; and 250 died of radiation-induced heart attacks. In addition, 30 fetuses developed mental disabilities after they were born. Such statistics have attracted little notice so far. The numbers cited in schoolbooks are much higher. According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, 105,000 people died of the \"long-term consequences of radiation.\" \"For commendable reasons, many critics have greatly exaggerated the health risks of radioactivity,\" says Albrecht Kellerer, a Munich radiation biologist. \"But contrary to widespread opinion, the number of victims is by no means in the tens of thousands.\" Especially surprising, though, is that the stories of birth defects in newborns are also pure fantasy. The press has repeatedly embellished photos of a destroyed Hiroshima with those of deformed children, children without eyes or with three arms. In reality, there hasn't been a single study that provides evidence of an elevated rate of birth defects. A final attempt to establish a connection is currently underway in Japan. The study includes 3,600 people who were unborn fetuses in their mothers' wombs on that horrific day in August 1945. But it too has failed to furnish any evidence of elevated chromosomal abnormality. In Germany, where nuclear fears have coalesced with the fear of dying forests and mad cow disease into a general psychosis of threat, the degree of concern over nuclear radiation remains high. To this day, some are so fearful about the long-term effects of fallout from Chernobyl that they refuse to eat mushrooms from Bavaria. Even 20 years ago such behavior would not have made sense. Officially 47 people -- members of the emergency rescue crews -- died in Chernobyl from exposure to lethal doses of radiation. This is serious enough. \"But overall the amount of radiation that escaped was simply too low to claim large numbers of victims,\" explains Kellerer. The iodine 131 that escaped from the reactor did end up causing severe health problems in Ukraine. It settled on meadows in the form of a fine dust, passing through the food chain, from grass to cows to milk, and eventually accumulating in the thyroid glands of children. About 4,000 children were afflicted with cancer. Less well-known, however, is the fact that only nine of those 4,000 died -- thyroid cancers are often easy to operate on.", "\n", "", "Martin, 1982 ", "Brian, associate professor in Science, Technology and Society at the University of Wollongong, \u201cThe Global Health Effects of Nuclear War,\u201d Current Affairs, December 7, www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/82cab/index.html#explosive)", "", "By the time stratospheric fallout reaches the earth, its radioactivity is greatly reduced.

It might not be as deadly as is widely believed.  The explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki (pictured) were devastating. The resulting radiation illnesses, though, weren't as bad as expected. Wearing mosquito helmets on their heads and radiation dosimeters on their belts, Clemens Woda and his three Russian colleagues drive past a bored-looking guard leaning nonchalantly against a meter-high fence. The truck moves past a yellow warning sign reading \"radioactivity\" and into the restricted zone. Inside, the streets and fields show the effects of years of abandonment and are overgrown with tall reeds. The area hugging the swampy banks of the Techa River has been unpopulated for decades.  The group reaches Metlino, a ghost town that was evacuated in 1956. A weather-beaten grain silo protrudes into the sky. The scientists take soil samples and, wearing rubber boots, wade through the mud over to a Russian Orthodox church in a depressing state of disrepair. One of them climbs the bell tower, hammers at the wall and slides a brick into his bag. The brick will be used as evidence. Woda, who works for the GSF Research Center for Health and the Environment, located in the town of Neuherberg near Munich -- Europe's largest radiation protection institute -- is currently involved in an exciting investigation. As part of the EU's \"SOUL\" (Southern Urals Radiation Risk Research) project, Woda and his team are exploring the region where the Soviets once manufactured the explosive material for their first atomic bomb. The Siberian factory was called Mayak (\"beacon\"). Workers from the gulags laid railroad track and built a \"closed city\" for 17,000 people, cooling towers and a radiochemical plant. The first nuclear reactor went online in 1948 and was soon producing weapons-grade plutonium for Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. The giant weapons laboratory did not appear on any map. A consensus in the West has been reached about what happened next. Soviet nuclear scientists stand accused of having irradiated the environment and of otherwise poisoning the surrounding area. The result, it is said, has been thousands of cancer deaths and myriads of deformed children. Indeed, this autumn, Mayak (of which not a single historic photo exists to this day) celebrated a gruesome anniversary. In the fall of 1957, a tank filled with 80 tons of nuclear waste exploded. According to an eyewitness, a \"strange, bright red fog\" rose several thousand meters into the air. \"In the winter,\" says the eyewitness, \"I would have terrible headaches and nosebleeds, and I almost went blind.\" The consequences of the 1957 nuclear accident in Siberia were \"far more serious\" than Chernobyl, the German television network ARD recently reported. \"Most of the pupils in my class died of cancer,\" says Gulchara Ismagilova, who was 11 at the time. But what really happened? That's what the team of Bavarian physicists have traveled to Siberia to find out, and that's why they are taking soil samples and packing bricks into their bags. They are also looking at other important pieces of evidence from the secret nuclear complex. \"The employees there were examined with a dosimeter, sometimes once a week, and required to provide urine samples,\" says GSF researcher Peter Jacob. The results of the tests were documented in more than 7,000 health records encased in gray cardboard folders. \"An invaluable archive,\" says Jacob. There are even kidneys and livers of workers who died at the site. Preserved in paraffin, they are kept stored next to frozen vials of blood at the Biophysical Institute of Osyorsk. Russian doctors are also collecting hair samples from those workers still alive today along with teeth that have fallen out. The samples are then sent to Germany; 200 teeth are already on file. Once analyzed by the GSF's state-of-the-art laboratories, the scientists will have radiation profiles for each person who worked at the nuclear plant. The project receives \u20ac6.8 million in grant money from the EU. Despite this wealth of material, the task is a difficult one. Mistrust of the operators of Mayak runs deep. According to environment organization Greenpeace, 272,000 people were harmed at the facility and in the surrounding area. Even in the town of Muslyumovo, 80 kilometers (50 miles) away, \"one in two adults are infertile, and one in three infants are born with deformities,\" a Greenpeace report says. As deeply disturbing as these claims are, the tests in no way bear them out. Indeed, a number of project groups at the GSF center near Munich are doing their best to determine just how many people fell victim to the radiation pollution at Mayak. Their conclusions? The horrors of Mayak are much less extensive than believed. There is no doubt that the workers at this plant east of the Ural Mountains performed dangerous work. Enveloped in a permanent atmosphere of fear -- with intelligence agents in black coats constantly hurrying through the hallways -- about 150 men would lift the warm, spent fuel elements from the reactors and carry them to the radiochemical plant. There, in a long brick building, workers, including many women, sat in a dimly lit environment and placed the encrusted rods into nitric acid, triggering a process that allowed them to remove the weapons-grade plutonium. While the same work was performed with remote-controlled robotic arms in the West, the Soviet workers were not even given masks to wear. There was nothing to stop plutonium gases from entering their lungs. And yet the amount of health damage sustained by these workers was astonishingly low. The GSF study has examined 6,293 men who worked at the chemical plant between 1948 and 1972. \"So far 301 have died of lung cancer,\" says Jacob. \"But only 100 cases were caused by radiation. The others were attributed to cigarettes.\" The second large, but as yet unpublished study by the GSF scientists also offers surprisingly low mortality figures. The subjects in this study were farmers who lived downstream from the nuclear reactors, in 41 small towns and villages along the Techa River. From 1949 to 1951, waste material from the plutonium production -- a bubbling toxic soup -- was simply poured into the river untreated. As a result, highly radioactive elements such as cesium 137 and strontium 90 were deposited in the river's sediments. The riverbanks became radioactive. Atomic Dangers or Doomsday Folklore?  A report warning of the dangers was sent to Moscow in 1951. A series of X-ray tests was conducted, and police officers were assigned to guard the river. \"We could only see the river through barbed wire or from a small wooden bridge,\" says a former resident. By 1960, 22 villages had been evacuated. From the standpoint of Russian citizens' groups, which are currently suing for compensation in the courts, these official steps were half-hearted. In their view, the plant management committed \"atomic genocide\" against the ethnic Tatars living in the area.  But as the analyses show, even this accusation is exaggerated. The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) studied 29,873 people who lived along the Techa between 1950 and 1960. According to the NCI scientists, only 46 deaths came about due to radiation exposure. The German researchers now know why the death rate was relatively low. Although the Techa was abused as a nuclear waste dump, the abuse was not as severe as the rumor-mongers would have us believe. \"The Techa farmer most heavily exposed to the radiation received a dose of only 0.45 Gray,\" explains Jacob. By comparison, a lethal dose of radiation, which causes fever, changes in the composition of the blood, irreparable damage to the body and death within two weeks, is 6 Gray. The findings hardly jive with the popular image of the atom as evil incarnate. Nightmarish scenarios of lingering illness and birth defects on an apocalyptic scale populate nightmares. In West Germany, the moral and political self-image of an entire generation arose from its battle against radiation, from \"no nukes\" protest marches to facing off against police water cannons at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant to sit-ins in front of Castor rail containers of reprocessed nuclear waste.", "\n", "Radiation won\u2019t kill everyone \u2013 lethal does is really high, people rapidly recover from lower doses, Hiroshima and Nagasaki prove.", "Kearny, 87", "Cresson H., two degrees in geology at Oxford, Jungle Experiment Officer of the Panama Mobile Force, demolitions expert in the Office of Strategic Services, research analyst at the Hudson Institute, worked with Herman Kahn on nuclear scenario planning, \u201cNuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded\u201d", "The radiation dose that will kill a person varies considerably with different people.

Almost all persons confined to expedient shelters after a nuclear attack would be under stress and without clean surroundings or antibiotics to fight infections. Many also would lack adequate water and food. Under these unprecedented conditions, perhaps half the persons who received a whole-body dose of 350 R within a few days would die.2", "Fortunately, the human body can repair most radiation damage if the daily radiation doses are not too large.

Significantly, no official U.S. estimates have been made available to the public regarding excess cancer deaths to be expected if America is subjected to a nuclear attack. However, reliable statistics are available on the numbers of additional fatal cancers suffered by persons who received large whole-body radiation doses at Hiroshima and in other disasters, and who lived for months to decades before dying. Dr. John N. Auxier -who for years was a leading health physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was one of the American scientists working in Japan with Japanese scientists studying the Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, and currently is working on radiation problems with International Technology Corporation-in 1986 summarized for me the risk of excess fatal cancers from large whole-body radiation doses: \"If 1,000 people each receive a whole-body radiation dose of 100 rems [or 100 rads, or 100 R], about 10 additional fatal cancers will result.\" These 10 fatal cancers will be in addition to about 150 fatal cancers that normally will develop among these 1,000 people during their lifetimes. This risk is proportional to large doses; thus, if 1,000 people each receive a dose of 200 rems, about 20 additional lethal cancer cases would be expected.  \"Rem\" is an abbreviation for \"roentgen equivalent (in) man.\" The rem takes into account the biological effects of different kinds of radiation. For external gamma-ray radiation from fallout, the numerical value of an exposure or dose given in roentgens is approximately the same as the numerical value given in rems or in rads. The rad is the unit of radiation energy absorption in any material and applies to all kinds of nuclear radiations. Therefore, for simplicity's sake, this book gives both instrument readings (exposures) and doses in roentgens (R).", "\n", "RERF, 2007", "Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Cooperative Japan-US research Organization, FAQ, http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/index.html", "", "Q.12 Are Hiroshima and Nagasaki still radioactive?", "A.12 The practical answer is, \"No.\" People often ask, \"If uranium and plutonium pose a potential hazard in nuclear waste sites and were present at dangerous levels in the environment following the Chernobyl nuclear accident, why aren't Hiroshima and Nagasaki still uninhabitable?\" There are two ways residual radioactivity is produced from an atomic blast. The first is due to fallout of the fission products or the nuclear material itself--uranium or plutonium (uranium was used for the Hiroshima bomb whereas plutonium was used for the Nagasaki bomb)--that contaminate the ground. Similar ground contamination occurred as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident, but on a much larger scale (click here for more-detailed explanation). The second way residual radioactivity is produced is by neutron irradiation of soil or buildings (neutron activation), causing non-radioactive materials to become radioactive. Fallout. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs exploded at altitudes of 600 meters and 503 meters, respectively, then formed huge fireballs that rose with the ascending air currents. About 10% of the nuclear material in the bombs underwent fission; the remaining 90% rose in the atmosphere with the fireball. Subsequently, the material cooled down and some of it started to fall with rain (black rain) in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki areas, but probably most of the remaining uranium or plutonium was dispersed widely in the atmosphere. Because of the wind, the rain did not fall directly on the hypocenters but rather in the northwest region (Koi, Takasu area) of Hiroshima and the eastern region (Nishiyama area) of Nagasaki. The maximum estimates of dose due to fallout are 0.01-0.03 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.2-0.4 Gy in Nagasaki. The corresponding doses at the hypocenters are believed to be only about 1/10 of these values. Nowadays, the radioactivity is so miniscule that it is difficult to distinguish from trace amounts (including plutonium) of radioactivity caused by worldwide fallout from atmospheric (as opposed to underground) atomic-bomb tests that were conducted around the world in past decades, particularly in the 1950's and 1960's. Neutron activation. Neutrons comprised 10% or less of the A-bomb radiation, whereas gamma rays comprised the majority of A-bomb radiation. Neutrons cause ordinary, non-radioactive materials to become radioactive, but gamma rays do not. The bombs were detonated far above ground, so neutron induction of radioactivity on the ground did not produce the degree of contamination people associate with nuclear test sites (Nevada test site in Southwest US, Maralinga test site in South Australia, Bikini and Mururoa Atolls, etc.). Past investigations suggested that the maximum cumulative dose at the hypocenter from immediately after the bombing until today is 0.8 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.3-0.4 Gy in Nagasaki. When the distance is [half a kilometer or a kilometer] 0.5 km or 1.0 km from the hypocenter, the estimates are about 1/10 and 1/100 of the value at the hypocenter, respectively. The induced radioactivity decayed very quickly with time. In fact, nearly 80% of the above-mentioned doses were released within a day, about 10% between days 2 and 5, and the remaining 10% from day 6 afterward. Considering the extensive fires near the hypocenters that prevented people from entering until the following day, it seems unlikely that any person received over 20% of the above-mentioned dose, ie, 0.16 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.06-0.08 Gy in Nagasaki. As for Hiroshima and Nagasaki proper, the longest-lasting induced radionuclide that occurred in amounts sufficient to cause concern was cesium-134 (with a half-life of about 2 years). Most of the induced radioactivities from various radionuclides decayed very quickly so that it now takes considerable time and effort to measure it using highly sensitive equipment. Despite such miniscule levels, measurements of residual radioactivity using recently developed ultra-sensitive techniques have been utilized to estimate neutron doses released from the bombs and have formed part of the basis of the latest atomic-bomb dosimetry (DS02).  Although the levels of residual radioactivity at the hypocenters in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were initially high, they declined quickly and are now far less than the dose received from background radiation. Hence, there is no detectable effect of present-day residual radiation on human health. In fact, today both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are thriving cities with large populations.", "", "\n", "Smith, 2002 Quentin, Western Michigan University, Review Essay of John Leslie's The End of the World (London: Routledge, 1996), pp. vii + 310. http://www.qsmithwmu.com/leslie_end_of_time.htm", "", "\u00a0\u00a0 I shall first discuss the most pertinent evidence we have about deaths from radiation. The evidence of the Chernoyble disaster have shown the dangers of radiation to have been greatly overestimated by previous studies. The explosion of the nuclear reactor at Chernoyble \"was comparable to a medium-size nuclear strike\", which is often defined as a 3,000 megaton war, in terms of radiation released. (See \"Ten Years of the Chernoyble Era\", by Yuri Shcherbak, Scientific American, April 1996, p. 45.) This does not include, of course, the immediate heat and blast effects of a bomb, but that is not the relevant issue here, which is the long term radiation effects. \"The destroyed reactor liberated hundreds of times more radiation than was produced by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\" (Yuri, p. 45). And yet the effects are considerably less than had normally been expected. Even Greenpeace Organization, which is politically inclined towards the worst case estimates, estimates only 32,000 deaths. (Yuri p. 46). A 1997 documentary indicated that animals, such as mice, are currently thriving next to the old reactor, contrary to expectations. The genes of the mice mutated, but the mice adapted and flourished. If there are only 32,000 deaths from long term radiation effects from an equivalent to a medium-sized nuclear strike of the US upon Russia, then we can effectively dismiss long term radiation as a potential cause of the extinction of the human species in a nuclear war.", "Nyquist, 1999 J.R., May 20, a WorldNetDaily contributing editor and a renowned expert in geopolitics and international relations, \u201cIs nuclear war survivable?\u201d www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=6341\n", "OK, so nuclear winter isn't going to happen. What about nuclear fallout? Wouldn't the radiation from a nuclear war contaminate the whole earth, killing everyone? The short answer is: absolutely not. Nuclear fallout is a problem, but we should not exaggerate its effects. As it happens, there are two types of fallout produced by nuclear detonations. These are: 1) delayed fallout; and 2) short-term fallout.  According to researcher Peter V. Pry, \"Delayed fallout will not, contrary to popular belief, gradually kill billions of people everywhere in the world.\" Of course, delayed fallout would increase the number of people dying of  cancer, leukemia, and cancer of the thyroid. \"However,\" says Pry, \"these deaths would probably be far fewer than deaths now resulting from ... smoking, or from  accidents.\" The real hazard in a nuclear war is the short-term fallout. This is a type of fallout created when a nuclear weapon is detonated at ground level. This type of fallout could kill millions of people, depending on the targeting strategy of the attacking country. But short-term fallout rapidly subsides to safe levels in 13 to 18 days. It is not permanent. People who live outside of the affected areas will be fine. Those in affected areas can survive if they have access to underground shelters. In some areas, staying indoors may even suffice. Contrary to popular misconception, there were no documented deaths from short-term or delayed fallout at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These blasts were low airbursts, which produced minimal fallout effects. Today's thermonuclear weapons are even \"cleaner.\" If used in airburst mode, these weapons would produce few (if any) fallout casualties.

(See Fig. 1.1.) ", "Many thousands of tons of earth from the crater of a large explosion are pulverized into trillions of particles. These particles are contaminated by radioactive atoms produced by the nuclear explosion. Thousands of tons of the particles are carried up into a mushroom-shaped cloud, miles above the earth. These radioactive particles then fall out of the mushroom cloud, or out of the dispersing cloud of particles blown by the winds thus becoming fallout.", "Each contaminated particle continuously gives off invisible radiation, much like a tiny X-ray machine while in the mushroom cloud, while descending, and after having fallen to earth. The descending radioactive particles are carried by the winds like the sand and dust particles of a miles-thick sandstorm cloud except that they usually are blown at lower speeds and in many areas the particles are so far apart that no cloud is seen. The largest, heaviest fallout particles reach the ground first, in locations close to the explosion. Many smaller particles are carried by the winds for tens to thousands of miles before falling to earth. At any one place where fallout from a single explosion is being deposited on the ground in concentrations high enough to require the use of shelters, deposition will be completed within a few hours.", "The smallest fallout particles those tiny enough to be inhaled into a person's lungs are invisible to the naked eye. These tiny particles would fall so slowly from the four-mile or greater heights to which they would be injected by currently deployed Soviet warheads that most would remain airborne for weeks to years before reaching the ground. By that time their extremely wide dispersal and radioactive decay would make them much less dangerous. Only where such tiny particles are promptly brought to earth by rain- outs or snow-outs in scattered \"hot spots,\" and later dried and blown about by the winds, would these invisible particles constitute a long-term and relatively minor post-attack danger. The air in properly designed fallout shelters, even those without air filters, is free of radioactive particles and safe to breathe except in a few' rare environments as will be explained later. Fortunately for all living things, the danger from fallout radiation lessens with time. The radioactive decay, as this lessening is called, is rapid at first, then gets slower and slower. The dose rate (the amount of radiation received per hour) decreases accordingly. Figure 1.2 illustrates the rapidity of the decay of radiation from fallout during the first two days after the nuclear explosion that produced it. R stands for roentgen, a measurement unit often used to measure exposure to gamma rays and X rays. Fallout meters called dosimeters measure the dose received by recording the number of R. Fallout meters called survey meters, or dose-rate meters, measure the dose rate by recording the number of R being received per hour at the time of measurement. Notice that it takes about seven times as long for the dose rate to decay from 1000 roentgens per hour (1000 R/hr) to 10 R/hr (48 hours) as to decay from 1000 R/hr to 100 R/hr (7 hours). (Only in high-fallout areas would the dose rate 1 hour after the explosion be as high as 1000 roentgens per hour.) If the dose rate 1 hour after an explosion is 1000 [Roentgens per hour] R/hr, it would take about 2 weeks for the dose rate to be reduced to 1 R/hr solely as a result of radioactive decay. Weathering effects will reduce the dose rate further,' for example, rain can wash fallout particles from plants and houses to lower positions on or closer to the ground. Surrounding objects would reduce the radiation dose from these low-lying particles. Figure 1.2 also illustrates the fact that at a typical location where a given amount of fallout from an explosion is deposited later than 1 hour after the explosion, the highest dose rate and the total dose received at that location are less than at a location where the same amount of fallout is deposited 1 hour after the explosion. The longer fallout particles have been airborne before reaching the ground, the less dangerous is their radiation. Within two weeks after an attack the occupants of most shelters could safely stop using them, or could work outside the shelters for an increasing number of hours each day. Exceptions would be in areas of extremely heavy fallout such as might occur downwind from important targets attacked with many weapons, especially missile sites and very large cities. To know when to come out safely, occupants either would need a reliable fallout meter to measure the changing radiation dangers, or must receive information based on measurements made nearby with a reliable instrument.", "\n", "BBC, April 20, 2006, \u201cWildlife defies Chernobyl radiation\u201d", "", "The exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station is teeming with life.

Plants and trees have sprung back to life, and rare species, such as lynx, Przewalski's horses, and eagle owls, are thriving where most humans fear to tread. From Red to Green The situation is a far cry from the way things looked just after the accident. Initially many animals died from the huge doses of radiation they received.  The red color of withered pine needles earned one large area near the reactor the name Red Forest. \"Now it is not the Red Forest but a real green forest, due to [growing] birch trees,\" said Sergey Gaschak from the International Radioecology Laboratory in Kiev, Ukraine.

Even the site of the explosion seems to be bursting with life.  \"I met a hare in the sarcophagus area, and birds nest there,\" said Gaschak, referring to the concrete and steel shell that encases the still smoldering reactor. But while wildlife seems to be proliferating in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, not everyone is convinced that these plants and animals are healthy.  Anders Moller from the University of Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France, and Tim Mousseau from the University of South Carolina (USC) in Columbia have been studying Chernobyl's bird populations. Mousseau is a National Geographic Society grantee. (National Geographic News is part of the National Geographic Society.) Moller and Mousseau have shown that certain species in the area have a higher rate of genetic abnormalities than normal. \"We find an elevated frequency of partial albinism in barn swallows, meaning they have tufts of white feathers,\" Mousseau said.  Late last year Moller and Mousseau published a paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology showing that reproductive rates and annual survival rates are much lower in the Chernobyl birds than in control populations.  \"In Italy around 40 percent of the barn swallows return each year, whereas the annual survival rate is 15 percent or less for Chernobyl,\" Mousseau said. Moller and Mousseau think that migratory species, such as the barn swallow, are particularly vulnerable to radioactive contaminants, because they arrive in the area exhausted and with depleted reserves of protective antioxidants due to their arduous journey. The scientists are also concerned that the mutated birds will pass on their abnormal genes to the global population.  \"In the worst case scenario these genetic mutations will spread out, and the species as a whole may experience enhanced levels of mutation,\" Mousseau said. \"Great Irony\" Mutation isn't the only adverse effect of the radiation. Working in the Red Forest area, James Morris, a USC biologist, has observed some trees with very strange twisted shapes.  The radiation, he says, is confusing the hormone signal that the trees use to determine which direction to grow.  \"These trees are having a terrible time knowing which way is up,\" Morris said. Gaschak, the Kiev ecologist, believes such radiation effects will diminish over time. He is celebrating the way that Chernobyl has burst into life and hopes that the area will become a national park one day. But Mousseau is less optimistic. \"One of the great ironies of this particular tragedy is that many animals are doing considerably better than when the humans were there,\" he said.

But the recent alarms in Britain, Europe and America about the fate of the honey bee \u2013 colonies have been crashing in increasing numbers \u2013 have started to open people's eyes to insects' importance in a more general way, says Matt Shardlow, director of Buglife, the Invertebrate Conservation Trust.  But it is only the beginning of an understanding, he says, and much more is needed if we are to take the action necessary to preserve our populations of insects and other invertebrates, the creatures without backbones which make up the majority of animal life, including snails, worms and spiders (spiders being arachnids, not insects).  The population declines among invertebrates in general and insects in particular are now greater than among any other group of living things, greater than declines in mammals, birds and plants. Yet although people get excited about endangered pandas, or eagles, or orchids, endangered insects generally remain below the level of their perception, Mr Shardlow says. \"There was a book published in the early 1990s called Insect Conservation, a Neglected Green Issue, and it remains the case that levels of awareness of what's happening with the small things, such as insects, are much lower than with what's happening with big things, such as trees, or birds, or whales,\" he says. \"The bigger you are, the bigger the bit of wildlife, the greater the chance that people will be paying attention to what's happening to you. \"There are more extinctions among invertebrates than in any other groups, and a greater proportion of the species are in decline, and the decline is steeper, than in plants, birds and mammals, wherever there is data.\" ", "", "They\u2019d feast on the corpses.", "A.F.

This error may be related to the incorrect claim that the cooling water is used to cool the reactors. It is used to condense the steam passing through the turbines, as is also the case in coal, gas or oil-fired generating stations. The assertion that radiation was one of the \u2018main killers\u2019 was presumably to make valid concerns about the destruction of aquatic life by once-through cooling water systems a nuclear generation issue, which it is not. \nThe key environmental issue for power stations sited on estuarine and marine sites is the number of organisms that are sucked through the condenser cooling water circuits and returned to sea. We know that the number of fish eggs and larvae sucked through these systems in Northern Europe is likely to be in the order of billions per year, a number that is truly colossal and almost incomprehensible. However, we must get a handle on the ecological meaning of this number and this requires more research and consideration of the options. \nThe article left the reader with the impression that destruction of large amounts of aquatic life is an inevitable consequence of nuclear power station operation. This is incorrect, as many engineering solutions are available. For example, cooling water intakes and outfalls can be better designed and located to minimise impacts, they can be fitted with fish exclusion devices, we can use cooling towers or dry cooling to reduce cooling water volume.

A.12 The practical answer is, \"No.\" People often ask, \"If uranium and plutonium pose a potential hazard in nuclear waste sites and were present at dangerous levels in the environment following the Chernobyl nuclear accident, why aren't Hiroshima and Nagasaki still uninhabitable?\" There are two ways residual radioactivity is produced from an atomic blast. The first is due to fallout of the fission products or the nuclear material itself--uranium or plutonium (uranium was used for the Hiroshima bomb whereas plutonium was used for the Nagasaki bomb)--that contaminate the ground. Similar ground contamination occurred as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident, but on a much larger scale (click here for more-detailed explanation). The second way residual radioactivity is produced is by neutron irradiation of soil or buildings (neutron activation), causing non-radioactive materials to become radioactive. Fallout. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs exploded at altitudes of 600 meters and 503 meters, respectively, then formed huge fireballs that rose with the ascending air currents. About 10% of the nuclear material in the bombs underwent fission; the remaining 90% rose in the atmosphere with the fireball. Subsequently, the material cooled down and some of it started to fall with rain (black rain) in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki areas, but probably most of the remaining uranium or plutonium was dispersed widely in the atmosphere. Because of the wind, the rain did not fall directly on the hypocenters but rather in the northwest region (Koi, Takasu area) of Hiroshima and the eastern region (Nishiyama area) of Nagasaki. The maximum estimates of dose due to fallout are 0.01-0.03 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.2-0.4 Gy in Nagasaki. The corresponding doses at the hypocenters are believed to be only about 1/10 of these values. Nowadays, the radioactivity is so miniscule that it is difficult to distinguish from trace amounts (including plutonium) of radioactivity caused by worldwide fallout from atmospheric (as opposed to underground) atomic-bomb tests that were conducted around the world in past decades, particularly in the 1950's and 1960's. Neutron activation. Neutrons comprised 10% or less of the A-bomb radiation, whereas gamma rays comprised the majority of A-bomb radiation. Neutrons cause ordinary, non-radioactive materials to become radioactive, but gamma rays do not. The bombs were detonated far above ground, so neutron induction of radioactivity on the ground did not produce the degree of contamination people associate with nuclear test sites (Nevada test site in Southwest US, Maralinga test site in South Australia, Bikini and Mururoa Atolls, etc.). Past investigations suggested that the maximum cumulative dose at the hypocenter from immediately after the bombing until today is 0.8 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.3-0.4 Gy in Nagasaki. When the distance is 0.5 km or 1.0 km from the hypocenter, the estimates are about 1/10 and 1/100 of the value at the hypocenter, respectively. The induced radioactivity decayed very quickly with time. In fact, nearly 80% of the above-mentioned doses were released within a day, about 10% between days 2 and 5, and the remaining 10% from day 6 afterward. Considering the extensive fires near the hypocenters that prevented people from entering until the following day, it seems unlikely that any person received over 20% of the above-mentioned dose, ie, 0.16 Gy in Hiroshima and 0.06-0.08 Gy in Nagasaki. As for Hiroshima and Nagasaki proper, the longest-lasting induced radionuclide that occurred in amounts sufficient to cause concern was cesium-134 (with a half-life of about 2 years). Most of the induced radioactivities from various radionuclides decayed very quickly so that it now takes considerable time and effort to measure it using highly sensitive equipment. Despite such miniscule levels, measurements of residual radioactivity using recently developed ultra-sensitive techniques have been utilized to estimate neutron doses released from the bombs and have formed part of the basis of the latest atomic-bomb dosimetry (DS02).  Although the levels of residual radioactivity at the hypocenters in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were initially high, they declined quickly and are now far less than the dose received from background radiation. Hence, there is no detectable effect of present-day residual radiation on human health. In fact, today both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are thriving cities with large populations.", "", "The ocean dose is five hundred and thirty times lower than that", "January 21, 2009", "Radioactive Contamination: Nuclear Fallout ", "", "After \"Bravo\", it was discovered that fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer (above the thermocline at 100 m depth), and the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530. In other 1954 tests, including \"Yankee\" and \"Nectar,\" hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as \"Zuni\" and \"Tewa\" [http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1c/0881_a.pdf] However, the major U.S. 'DELFIC' (Defence Land Fallout Interpretive Code) computer calculations use the natural size distributions of particles in soil instead of the afterwind sweep-up spectrum, and this results in more straightforward fallout patterns lacking the downwind hotspot.", "", "The curves in the figures represent averages over all the land areas in wide latitude zones.

If the fire ball from the explosion does not reach the ground, the blast is said to be an `air burst'. Radiation (except for initial radiation) does not become a factor in an air burst. Gamma rays from the fallout can easily be attenuated by incorporating a 90 degree turn in the small diameter entrance. Entrances should not exceed 48 inches in diameter and the total length of the vertical and horizontal run should be no less than 25 feet.

It was an unknown and very complex topic, hard data was scant, so guesstimates prevailed.  Not only were these educated guesses rampant throughout the process, but it was deemed prudent, given the gravity of the subject, to lean toward the worst-case end of the spectrum for dozens of the numbers involved.

Many other interactions can be speculated upon, such as those of radiation-induced depression of the human immune system, disruption of medical services and epidemics of contagious diseases; such synergisms deserve the serious study that might allow us to draw less speculative conclusions. Therefore it is still quite plausible that climatic disturbances, radioactive fallout, ozone depletions and the interruption of basic societal services, when taken together, could threaten more people globally than would the direct effects of explosions in a large nuclear war. In assessments of the severity of the nuclear winter problem, the long-term trend in temperature estimates has been directed away from the most severe effects. This trend has not been a smooth one, however. Researchers have made refinements and enhancements to the theory that have made the climatic effects both more and less severe. This was expected because original estimates of uncertain effects tried to incorporate \"middle of the road\" assumptions. Thus, researchers knew that the tentative conclusions about nuclear winter would change with time depending on the latest refinements. This is, of course, a legitimate and normal process of scientific assessment. Despite the potential for future changes in conclusions, we think it is unlikely that some unforeseen effect would either bring the estimates of nuclear winter back to the range of total climatic catastrophe or eliminate environmental effects altogether. The cases we have examined (20, 60 and 180 million tons of smoke) bracket what we believe to be a wide range of probable effective smoke amounts for a large nuclear war. But it is conceivable that even larger amounts of smoke could be created, although the probability now seems small. Similarly, less than 20 million tons of smoke could be produced, at some low probability, even after a large war in which many cities were struck.

The author, Tom J. Chalko, is on the staff of the dynamics and Vibration group in the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, of the University of Melbourne. I assume that his background is in mechanical engineering. However, he is also billed as \"Head of the Geophysics Division\" of \"Scientific Engineering Research P/L, which certainly appears to belong to Chalko in its entirety, and may be nothing more than an extension of himself. It is significant that his position as a \"geophysicist\" appears to be one invented by himself. He is also evidently the founder of \"Thiaoouba Prophecy and The Freedom of Choice\", which lists among Chalko's accomplishments \"The Amazing bioresonant Chakra Shirt. You can also explore the mysteries of self healing, astral travel and levitation. It would appear that Chalko may be a less than totally reliable source of scientific arguments over the explodeability of the Earth. But, of course, we are obliged to consider the argument as well as the source. In this case, the webpage is only a summary or introduction. So I followed the link at the bottom and downloaded the paper in PDF format. The alleged justification is given as a mathematical argument, so that much of the paper will not be accessible to those who don't at least recognize the basics of applied calculus. As one might expect, it's a bogus argument. The premise is an alleged proof that there is a minimum possible size for the central solid core of the Earth, but it's based on the false premise that the core must remain at all times in equilibrium at the center. Furthermore, the argument that the central equilibrium is unstable is based on the false condition that the pressure gradient and gravitational forces act in opposition, but they do not. A solid core displaced from the center sees only restoring forces, and thus cannot be forced from its position as Chalko tries to show. And, if that weren't enough, the viscosity of the liquid outer core and relatively sold mantle are ignored, which is a fatal flaw in any analysis of the dynamic behavior of the core. And, if even that were not enough, there is no thermodynamic analysis at all. How can one argue that the Earth's interior will \"overheat\" if one does not even consider basic thermodynamics? The sun irradiates the Earth's surface to the tune of roughly 1370 Watts per square meter (W/m^2). Climate related changes in radiative forcing are on the order of 1 W/m^2. The average outward geothermal flux is about 0.06 W/m^2. It is hard to see how a change in radiative forcing at the surface, on the order of 1/1000 would seriously affect the already miniscule heat flow from the Earth. In any case, a proper treatment of the thermal conditions at the surface, and throughout the Earth is required to make definitive statements, but there is no attempt at such in Chalko's paper. The other issue is whether or not a planet can \"explode\". As is the case for any explosion, one must demonstrate the presence of an energy source, and a process that can generate energy very much faster than it can be dissipated through radiative of hydrodynamic means. No such source has ever been identified for the Earth or any other planet. There are vague references to radioactive material and fission explosions in various \"exploding planet\" hypotheses (such as Tom van Flandern's), and evidently Chalko makes the same vague argument (or shall we call it \"hope\"?).

He said the Cox report doesn't claim, nor is there any evidence, that China has deployed a neutron bomb. Cox said the argument that China developed a smaller nuclear warhead on its own is not believable. The United States conducted numerous tests in developing its own weapon, the W-88 warhead used on the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile, but China conducted very few tests. ``Testing something that is very similar to the most sophisticated nuclear weapon in the world and getting it right immediately -- no one in the U.S. government believed that that was possible,'' Cox said. The Chinese rebuttal of the Cox report, titled ``Facts Speak Louder Than Words and Lies Will Collapse on Themselves,'' asserted that China began work on a neutron bomb in the 1970s, when the United States and the Soviet Union intensified their arms race. Design theft denied ``China had no choice but to continue to carry out research and development of nuclear weapons technology and improve its nuclear weapons systems, mastering in succession the neutron-bomb design technology and the nuclear weapon miniaturization technology,'' the report said. It denied that China stole the technology involved in those two designs and argued that many design details of the nuclear weapons cited in the Cox report were available in unclassified documents and on the Internet. It also rejected allegations in the Cox report that China had stolen American technology used to launch satellites.  In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen said it made little difference from a security standpoint whether China developed its own neutron bomb or stole the technology from U.S. labs.

It has a larger radiation reach, and therefore would kill more people, than traditional nuclear bombs. But a single neutron bomb also has a considerable explosive force and would cause massive devastation if detonated near a large urban area.

The \"worst case\" scenario would be, in part, similar to the spread of the AIDS virus, where humans can travel for up to ten or fifteen years without any visible signs of illness. If we add to this long incubation period a virus that is as highly contagious as the Spanish Influenza, then we have a worst case scenario. In order to have human extinction, we need the added requirement that there are no pockets of human population that are isolated from outside visitors during the period of contagion, sickness and death. But there are many such populations, e.g., on various islands in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, however small they be, and these would survive the disease.\u00a0 All that is needed for survival is, say, an isolated band of 10,000 people or so in the Northern Latitudes who are self-sufficient in their food supplies and are able to reproduce.

From 1980 to 1992, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mortality from infectious disease in the United States rose 58 percent. Old diseases such as cholera and measles have developed new resistance to antibiotics. Intensive agriculture and land development is bringing humans closer to animal pathogens. International travel means diseases can spread faster than ever.

One of the Hadley cells normally extends from 30 degrees North to the equator. This is separate from another cell that extends from the equator to 30 degrees South. The danger from nuclear war is that these two cells would no longer be separate, but merge into a single cell. The 10, 400 nuclear explosions would warm the troposphere, due to the absorption of sunlight by the smoke clouds and this would cause a single Hadley cell to extend from 30 degrees North to 30 degrees South, carrying the smoke and dust clouds that block the sunlight and cause lowering temperatures. Darkness and freezing temperatures would destroy food supplies and other items necessary for survival. However, this Hadley cell would not extend further than 30 degrees South.\u00a0 The wind patterns would protect the southernmost parts of the earth from the dust and smoke clouds. The circulation pattern below 30 degrees south is governed by a distinct Hadley cell that circulates wind from 30 degrees South to 60 degrees South. This covers the southern halves of Australia, Argentina and Chili, and includes all of New Zealand. This is sufficient for the human race to survive. Survival may mean that there are left only 100,000 people on New Zealand or southern Chili, people who are reduced to living and reproducing in Stone Age conditions.

I disagree, both morally and politically, with the stance that preventing nuclear war has become the most important social issue for all humans. Surely, in the Third World, concern over the actuality of massive suffering and millions of deaths resulting from poverty and exploitation can justifiably take precedence over the possibility of a similar death toll from nuclear war.

Even within a species there were marked differences An increase in UV-B could cause a shift in population rather than a large die-off Calculations made in the 70s assum large nuclear arsenals with many high-yield explosions since the number of high-yield weapons in present nuclear arsenals is smaller significant ozone reductions are unlikely .[31] The switch to smaller weapons means that the effect on ozone is unlikely to lead to any effect on human population levels and ozone reductions is out of the question Ultraviolet levels are over 1,000 times higher at the equator than at the polar regions so marine life at the equator is adapted increase in UV-B could cause a shift in population rather than a large die-off plankton change the weather plankton try to protect themselves by producing DMSP which is the beginning of how clouds are formed. DMS molecules completely refresh themselves after only three to five days plankton react to UV rays quickly enough to impact their own weather Ozone depletion is small in relation to the natural fluctuations which can reach some 100 percent from day to day. As for concerns about amphibians the missing legs blamed on UV are in fact due to parasites The primary cause heating of the stratosphere by smoke which strongly absorbs solar radiation Higher stratospheric temperatures accelerate catalytic reaction cycles, particularly those of odd-nitrogen, which destroy ozone Mills reckons that nuclear war would decay 40 percent of the ozone layer Previous models during the 80s investigations revealed that impact of the nuclear detonations would be much more moderate recent meltdown at Chernobyl reminded the world of the dangers of the atom the death counts are nonsense in the 80 physicists considered the doomsday reports to be exaggerated. all of Hiroshima's victims died quickly radiation sickness was rare for [eighty six thousand 700 people eventually died as a result of radiati there hasn't been a single study that provides evidence of an elevated rate of birth defects. By the time stratospheric fallout reaches the earth, its radioactivity is greatly reduced stratospheric fallout does not have the potential to cause widespread and immediate sickness or death. The fireball does not touch the ground An air burst produces only extremely small radioactive particles- they are airborne for ears unless brought to earth Wet deposition can result in '\"hot spots '\"hot spots are less dangerous than the fallout produced by surface bursting . thermonuclear weapons are clean\" bombs the radioactive fallout from a \"clean\" bomb is significantly less than that from a fission weapon The altitude of an air burst can be varied to obtain maximum blast there is essentially no local fallout from an air burst Tactically, air bursts are the most likely to be used against ground forces. What health effects have been seen among the children born to atomic-bomb survivors Efforts be continue to this day no evidence of genetic effects has been found any effects of inherited mutations are likely to be small against the normal incidence rates of cancer and disease. the common perception that exposed individuals bear children with deformities is not backed up by scientific study . mutations in DNA do occur during sexual reproduction ionizing radiation alter DNA in a parent which is then passed down to a child instances of both low and high levels of ionizing radiation no increase in genetic affects has been noted Myth: Most of the children of people who have been exposed to radiatio will be genetically damaged overwhelming evidence does show that the exaggerated fears of radiation damage to future generations are not supported by scientific findings genetic mutations are negligible compared radiation can deform fetuses in the womb but that has nothing to do with genetic mutations Eating food produced in the years after a large attack would cause an increase in cancer this increase would be a small fraction Cancer deaths would not be numerous enough to endanger the long-term survival of the population. If fallout particles do not become mixed with od that are eaten, no harm is done Peeling fruits and vegetables removes essentially all fallout Water would not be contaminated water containing radioactive elements can be made safe for drinking RERF 7 How many cancer deaths have occurred among survivors nuclear radiation might not be as deadly as is widely believed workers were not given masks to wear. There was nothing to stop plutonium gases from entering their lungs. And yet the amount of health damage sustained by these workers was astonishingly low. 301 died of lung cancer only 100 cases were caused by radiation. The others were attributed to cigarettes The NCI ) studied 29,873 people only 46 deaths came about due to radiation exposure the human body can repair most radiation damage if the daily doses are not large Only a very small fraction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki citizens who survived radiation doses have suffered serious delayed effects radiation doses that survivors of a nuclear attack would receive would result in risks of death from cancer, but the lifetime risks are not as bad as many believe If 1,000 people each receive a whole-body radiation dose of 100 rems about 10 additional fatal cancers will result Are Hiroshima and Nagasaki still radioactive The answer is, \"No the radioactivity is so miniscule that it is difficult to distinguish from trace amounts caused by worldwide fallout from atmospheric there is no detectable effect of present-day residual radiation on human health both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are thriving cities with large populations. Chernoyble disaster have shown the dangers of radiation to have been greatly overestimated Chernoyble was comparable to a nuclear strike Even Greenpeace estimates only 32,000 deaths we can dismiss long term radiation as a potential cause of the extinction delayed fallout would increase the number of people dying of cancer However these deaths would be far fewer than deaths now resulting from ... smoking The real hazard is short-term fallout But fallout subsides to safe levels in 13 to 18 days Those affected can survive if they stay indoors Today's thermonuclear weapons produce few (if any) fallout casualties he cancers and genetic defects caused by global fallout would cause only a small increase in the current rates global fallout from even the largest nuclear war poses no threat to the survival of the human species The scientific evidence is fallout would only kill people who are immediately downwind of surface nuclear explosions fallout has no potential for causing massive immediate death An all-out nuclear war between Russia and the U S t would be far from the end of human life fallout particles tiny enough to be inhaled into a person's lungs are invisible to the naked eye. These tiny particles fall slowly most would remain airborne for years their decay would make them much less dangerous Only hot spots would constitute a long-term and relatively minor post-attack danger Within two weeks after an attack the occupants of most shelters could safely stop using them The exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station is teeming with life \"Animals don't seem to sense radiation and will occupy an area regardless There may be plutonium in the zone, but there is no herbicide or pesticide, no industry, no traffic, and marshlands are no longer being drained it's typical for animals to be radioactive - too radioactive for humans to eat safely - but otherwise healthy the benefits to wildlife of removing people from the zone, have far outweighed any harm from radiation small volumes of nuclear waste from power production should be stored in tropical forests and other habitats in need of a reliable guardian unfortunate creatures can adapt to their circumstances mice in the Red Forest lived as long as animals in relatively clean areas The distinction between the local and newcomer animals was very evident.\" Sergey has only found one mouse with cancer-like symptoms He has found ample evidence of DNA mutations, but nothing that affected the animals' physiology or reproductive ability. radioactive cloud may have a silver lining. the exclusion zone\" set up around the reactor has turned into a wildlife haven. Even the site of the explosion seems to be bursting with life. the great ironies of this tragedy is that animals are doing better than when humans were Cockroaches are more resistant to radiation than humans Roach cells divide more slowly than human cells, which gives them more time to fix problems caused by radiation 450 rads may kill 50 per cent of the persons exposed They exposed similar groups of 50 flour beetles and 100 fruit flies which represented other living forms to similar doses. Many bugs survived Fruit flies and flour beetles are found to be tougher than cockroaches. recent alarms about the honey bee have started to open people's eyes to insects' endangered insects generally remain below the level of their perception here are more extinctions among invertebrates than in any other groups, and a greater proportion of the species are in decline, and the decline is steeper Flies and other insects are more resistant to radiation than mammals, and would have abundant food supply in the many human and animal corpses Dark, shiny surfaces reflect light in a way that makes them look like water insects zero in on what seems like place to feed they are fatally disappointed insects are driven to the mirage by their instincts. \" They can't leave o they get eaten by birds or die of exhaustion or can't reproduce.\" Depleting insect populations it is incorrect that one of the main killers of fish and plankton passing through the cooling water circuits is radiation The assertion that radiation was one of the \u2018main killers\u2019 was presumably to make valid concerns about the destruction of aquatic life by cooling water systems The key environmental issue is the number of organisms that are sucked through the condenser cooling water circuits Coral is again flourishing in the crater left by the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated The 15-megaton hydrogen bomb was 1,000 times more powerful than the weapon that destroyed Hiroshima The scientific evidence to date points to zero impact if the nuclear material sits on the bottom Other analyses of radioactive spills in the marine environment have reached a similar conclusion is \"virtually impossible\" for measurable concentrations of radioactivity to reach the surface from deep water sticky mud and clay provide the best burial grounds for nuclear waste any leak would be bound up by the clays for millions of years Nothing's going to bring it into the biosphere, unless we figure out how to reverse gravity Are Hiroshima and Nagasaki still radioactive No The maximum estimates of dose due to fallout are 0.01-0.03 and 0.2-0.4 the maximum dose is 0.8 Gy nearly 80% of the above-mentioned doses were released within a day and the remaining 10% from day 6 afterward . fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530 At any specific location in the model the temperatures are considerably more variable areas near coasts experience little effect TTAPS predict a minimum land temperature of -23 after 3 weeks Ocean temperatures are unlikely to cool more than 3 \uf0b0 C because of their large heat capacity, studies quantitatively overlap in quantity of black carbon injected into the model atmospheres that parameter is independent of the scenario The meltdown refer to spans not just the 30 plus degree difference between the old results and the new 'nuclear winter' entered a million fold reduction in sunlight, not one of ten watts per square meter The wind patterns would protect the southernmost parts of the earth from the dust and smoke clouds The circulation pattern below 30 degrees south is governed by a distinct Hadley cel This is sufficient for the human race to survive this is the worst case scenario of an American-Russian war for which there is any evidence, the evidence indicates that it is highly improbable that a global nuclear war would cause extinction a large nuclear war in the northern hemisphere would have the following effects on Australia from fallout 1000 people from cancers and genetic defects over 50 years In Nagasaki people survived uninjured who were far inside tunnel shelters This was true even though lters lacked blast doors and were inside the zone within which all buildings were destroyed The great life-saving potential of blast-protective shelters has been proven in war and confirmed by blast tests and calculations. Some radiation from fallout will penetrate shielding materials However the radiation dose occupants would receive can be reduced to a dose smaller than the average American receives during his lifetime from X rays Gamma rays from the fallout can easily be attenuated by incorporating a 90 degree turn in the small diameter n hardened blast and radiation shelters people could survive all nuclear weapons effects U S has never taken civil defense seriously Other countries have shelter space for the entire population Russian strategists believe that a well-prepared system of tunnels and underground bunkers could save many millions of lives Russia has built a comprehensive shelter system for its urban populace Schell's argument cannot be saying that any risk a policy decision might culminate in eventual nuclear usage has to weighted as a 100% certain extinction risk Such a claim is on the face of it unsustainable since any and every conceivable action might entail an infinitesimally small heightening of nuclear risk According to Sagan even a limited nuclear exchange would cause a global temperature drop The greatest volcanic eruptions changed world 5 degrees Once you abandon strict adherence to what science tells us anything is possible In one context, maybe you will get some mobilization against nuclear war. But in another you get Nazi euthanasia The TTAPS model entailed a long series of conjectures: Not only were these educated guesses rampant throughout the process, but it was deemed prudent to lean toward the worst-case Political considerations subliminally skewed the model Synergistic and unpredicted effects. The interaction of different effects a major global nuclear war with no effective civil defence measures taken, could kill directly perhaps 400 to 450 million people might add up to several hundred million deaths to the total, though this is most uncertain.  Such an eventuality would be a catastrophe far from extinction Even in the most extreme case there would remain alive In assessments of the severity of the nuclear winter problem, the long-term trend in temperature estimates has been directed away from the most severe effects Despite the potential for future changes in conclusions, we think it is unlikely that some unforeseen effect would either bring the estimates of nuclear winter back to the range of total climatic catastrophe In the absence of near-infinite consequences it is unwise to base expensive policy solely on very low probability cases How can one argue that the Earth's interior will \"overheat\" if one does not even consider basic thermodynamics As is the case for any explosion, one must demonstrate the presence of an energy source No such source has ever been identified for the Earth It is just \"handwaving\", as we say in the science biz. the Earth has several distinct layers The last layer is the core, which is separated into the liquid outer core and the solid inner core The outer core is composed mainly of a nickel-iron alloy, while the inner core is almost entirely composed of iron a major global nuclear war , could kill directly perhaps 400 million people far from extinction Even in the most extreme case there would remain alive about nine-tenths of the world's population, most of them unaffected physically wind patterns would protect parts of the earth from the The circulation pattern below 30 degrees south is governed by a distinct Hadley cel This is sufficient for the human race to survive this is the worst case scenario of an American-Russian war for which there is any evidence, it is highly improbable that a global nuclear war would cause extinction thermal pulses from an air burst can set fire to easily ignitable materials It can cause second-degree skin burns as far as ten miles On a cloudy day particles in the air would absorb and scatter much of the heat radiation Firestorms\" could occur only when concentration of combustible structures is very high most people in earth- would not have their lives endangered by fires Firestorms would endanger few' Americans Lack of oxygen is not a hazard to occupants of shelters monoxide, toxic smoke from fires or concentrations of carbon dioxide exhaled breaths would kill occupants before they suffered seriously from lack of oxygen. Leslie to Sagan's COSMOS, which mentions this as a mere epistemic possibility, not as a known probability: \"Many microorganisms would be killed; we do not know which ones or how many No cobalt or other salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested In light of the ready availability of fission-fusion-fission bombs, it is unlikely any special-purpose fallout contamination weapon will ever be developed No cobalt or other salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested, and none have ever been built British did test a bomb that incorporated cobalt The experiment was regarded as a failure and not repeated . Only a small number of neutron warheads were produced and Washington never deployed the weapon because of the surrounding political controversy warheads appear to have been scrapped The neutron arms race ended without ever having properly begun The US managed to build just ten warheads, while the USSR had yet to finalise its project The issue of neutron weapons was quickly forgotten in both the US and the USSR the Cox report doesn't claim nor is there any evidence, that China has deployed a neutron bomb. even if does, it would rve no useful purpose in a war The real issue now isn't whether they've got a neutron bomb, it's why on earth they would want to have one reports have claimed that Israel has developed neutron bombs they are difficult to develop and require significant testing. This makes it unlikely that Israel has in fact acquired them , France announced that it had tested a neutron device in 1986, France announced that it was abandoning production political pressure In the aftermath of nuclear attack Americans would be in rural areas: many would need antibiotics their need could be met by supplies of veterinarian antibiotics kept on livestock farms veterinary antibiotics are in larger supply than are those for people An all-out attack would destroy most of these modern blessings survivors would be forced to live under medical conditions the human body has remarkable capabilities for healing itself especially if the injured benign neglect purposeful non-interference was called \"masterful inactivity\" t the odds for complete extinction are exponentially lower than the odds for massive deaths Wind and water patterns are insufficient to infect every person on earth to have human extinction, we need the added requirement that there are no pockets of human population that are isolated from outside visitors But there are many such populations the probabilities are so low that they are virtually negligible. The Black Plague killed one European in four AIDS has produced a similar death to agriculture and land development is bringing humans closer to animal pathogens. International travel means diseases can spread faster than ever wind patterns would protect parts of the earth from the dust . The circulation pattern below 30 degrees south is governed by a distinct Hadley cell 100,000 people reproducing in Stone Age conditions is the worst case scenario of an American-Russian war for which there is any evidence For most of our history we survived by hunting and gathering The advantage of\u00a0 small population density was that very few infectious diseases could be supported Without \"new\" hosts to infect, most infections could not be sustained the majority of Americans who would receive radiation , the help of doctors would not be of life-or-death importance Very few would become sick The human body can repair almost all radiation damage The majority will recover without medical treatmen all doctors magically were to survive an attack few additional lives could be saved. If peace is declared suburban Seoul is poised to invade real estate North Koreans are building an industrial megapark . This has spurred an international coalition of scientists to consecrate the area for a peace park and nature preserve The effects of global nuclear war would hit the U S Europe and the Soviet Union he gospel of nuclear extinction can be seen as a way by which a problem for the rich white Western societies is claimed to be a problem for all the world. this is only Western self-centredness Third World populations would in many ways be better off the Third World, concern over suffering and millions of deaths can justifiably take precedence over the possibility of a similar death toll from nuclear war permanent psychological derangements were rare after atomic bomb attacks Some maintain after an atomic attack America would degenerate into anarchy They forget the history of human catastrophes and self- sacrificing strengths human beings are capable of History indicates Americans in the food-rich areas would help the starving Even if 100 metropolitan areas are destroyed, there would be more wealth in this country than in all of Russia U S is a very wealthy and educated if half the population were killed, survivors would not just lie down and die. Nor suffer disastrous social disorganization surviving animals would provide food and fertile breeding stock for national recovery experiments show offspring of irradiated animals are healthy and fertile Even if all food-producing animals were lost, surviving Americans should be able to live on grains, beans, vegetables enough trucks and fuel would survive after few weeks, survivors should receive basic foods Both U S and Soviet Union place high priority on targeting opponent's forces sizable fraction of nuclear arsenals is likely to be destroyed before use one sixth to one third of superpower arsenals will be used, possibility of U.S. nuclear attack should not be dismissed. Nuclear counterforce was the cornerstone of American national security strategy In a new era of U.S. nuclear primacy, policymakers may consider nuclear escalation during crises or if nonnuclear military operations go badly MAD is nearing an end It will soon be possible for U S to destroy long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a first strike. the world--will live in the shadow of U.S. nuclear primacy for years to come. global nuclear war, might kill \"only\" some hundreds of millions of people - an unprecedented disaster to be sure, but far short of global annihilation. few survivors of a heavy attack would be in areas where they could live off the land like primitive hunters and gatherers Survival plans should not include dependence on hunting, fishing, or gathering consensus science an pernicious development that ought to be stopped science has nothing to do with consensus requires only one investigator to be right, he or she has results that are verifiable by reference no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science examples can be endlessly consensus errors go on and on Consensus is invoked where science is not solid Nobody says consensus of scientists agrees E=mc2. the sun is
