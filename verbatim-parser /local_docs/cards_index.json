In the thirty years between my grandparents moving in with their three babies and me being born, Englewood had gone from being a (mostly) middle-income community, close-knit and quiet, to one of the poorest, most barren parts of the city. My neighborhood had so many problems: poverty, unemployment, underfunded schools, police brutality, pollution, violence. And those were just the big ones. I rarely saw anyone in power try to solve the problems in Englewood. And when they did try, it seemed to make things worse.", "When I asked my mom and grandma why Englewood looked like this, they didn\u2019t tell me about guns or drugs or gangs. They told me about the government. About how the highway system had been built through black neighborhoods, destroying communities that would never be rebuilt. About the public housing authority razing public housing and scattering families in the name of \u201curban development,\u201d only for city officials to turn around and sell the land to developers on the cheap, now that the projects sat on prime real estate.

Such statements can be found in the Constitution, statutes, regulation, case law (that is, court decisions), agency or leadership decisions, or even in changes of the behavior of government officials at all levels. For example, a law that says that those caught driving while intoxicated will go to jail for up to one year is a statement of governmental policy to punish drunk drivers. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a statement of government policy toward the environment\u2026.", "And: \u201cPolicy is what the government chooses to do or not to do\u201d about a public problem.", "This is all true. But definitions like this make policy design sound like it\u2019s orderly and contained\u2014much like going to the doctor. You have a problem; the doctor diagnoses it; you two find the best treatment. Creating policy is more like going to the doctor with a problem, having fifteen people argue about if it\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d problem that requires a doctor to begin with, then having five of those people (plus some new strangers!) start arguing anew about what the cause of the problem is, only to be interrupted by the doctor\u2019s boss coming in to tell them that they can only choose two of five possible treatment options because the other three would hurt the hospital\u2019s bottom line. And once treatment begins, people argue over how to determine whether it\u2019s successful and if it should be reversed to save money or time.", "Policymaking is not a science. It is a fight over whose problems get addressed, how those problems are addressed, and how public power and resources are distributed. If politics is a fight to elect people who reflect and share our values, policy is a fight to actually enact those values\u2014to mold the world, through the work of government, into what we think it should be.", "That is why, contrary to popular belief, the most important part of a policy proposal is not the details\u2014at least at the beginning. It\u2019s the vision that the policy presents. As a statement about what the government is going to do, policy inherently tells a story about what went wrong, how the government can fix it, and who has power to shape society\u2014whether it\u2019s the state or the public or corporations. The best policies tell compelling stories, galvanizing legislators and citizens to fight for them, and provide public servants with a clear purpose when they sit down to implement the details. The stories may shift as opponents pick new battles; the details may need tweaks or overhauls as unexpected challenges emerge. A coherent policy vision provides the foundation that both the stories and the details draw upon. Three pillars\u2014the problem, principles, and power\u2014form that foundation, and anchor policymaking from conception to execution.", "Problems are the center of any public policy. Because policy is the government\u2019s response to a problem, policy can only be created if we agree that an issue constitutes not just a problem but a public problem\u2014that is, a problem that affects the public that cannot be solved without the government. How we define the scope and origin of the problem determines how we\u2019ll craft a solution. That\u2019s why fossil fuel companies spend millions to sow doubts about the urgency of the climate crisis and cover up their culpability. It\u2019s not just about saving face; it\u2019s about changing our understanding of the problem and preventing government action.", "Principles. Policymakers need a compass to navigate the near-infinite variety of policy designs, and principles\u2014 which include both our moral values and our theories of government\u2014provide that compass. Remember, policymaking is collective problem-solving\u2014not an objective \u201cscience.\u201d Policymaking, like all decision-making, is guided not only by facts but by our values\u2014about freedom and justice, about what we deserve, about what \u201cother people\u201d deserve and, perhaps most crucially, about what the government should and should not do. Principles are, in short, the moral and intellectual core of a policy. They define not only how we engage with a problem but what solutions we consider at all.", "Problems in our society are rooted in power. Asking why a problem remains unresolved leads to questions of power: Who wields it and to what end? Are the powerful negligent or malevolent? By directing and entrenching flows of government resources and attention, policy always shapes the distribution of power. Effective, lasting policy changes must change the distributions of power that led to the problem initially, or else the old malefactors will undermine any success. When selecting the mechanisms a policy will use (a loan; a new legal protection; a direct public investment; a new federal agency), policymakers are deciding how to maintain or disrupt the balance of power. And this is not limited to power in the public sector. Governments write the laws, enforce the contracts, and build the infrastructure that make a society and economy possible. Policy changes reverberate beyond the public sector into every domain of our lives.", "Problems, principles, and power are the pillars of any policy vision. Together, they animate the policymaking process, guiding not just the story policymakers tell but the decisions they make about what should (or should not) be included in a given proposal.", "IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL A POLICY?", "The Green New Deal is a proposal for a ten-year economic mobilization to rapidly transition the US to a zero-carbon economy and, in so doing so, regenerate and reorganize the US economy in ways that significantly reduce inequality and redress legacies of systemic oppression.

Create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.", "3. Invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.", "4. Secure clean air and water, climate and community resilience, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment for all.", "5. Promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities, including Indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, lowincome workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.", "The GND resolution proposes to achieve these goals in two ways. The first is through a set of \u201cprojects\u201d that, if completed, would nearly eliminate carbon emissions in the US. The second is through a set of policies that aim to protect Americans from the disruption and instability that transitioning away from fossil fuels will create and reduce inequity. Some people like to refer to the first set of projects as the \u201cGreen\u201d part of the GND and the second as the \u201cNew Deal\u201d part. While this may be a helpful rhetorical device, it is a dangerous way to conceptualize the GND. All parts of the GND advance decarbonization\u2014even the \u201cnon-climate\u201d policies like universal health care, education, and job training. Similarly, the \u201cgreen\u201d projects can help reduce inequity if they are designed to create millions of wellpaying jobs, bolster worker power, invest in local communities, and strengthen the social safety net\u2014all of which the Green New Deal proposes to do. Addressing decarbonization and inequality simultaneously has prompted critics to accuse the GND of being a \u201cprogressive wish list,\u201d not a policy. Their criticism often reveals a narrow policy vision guiding their thinking. The problem is simply the carbon in the atmosphere; Mr. Policy Doctor will prescribe the correct solution based on science; imbalances of power are mostly irrelevant, too difficult to disrupt when an urgent crisis needs solving. This is a compelling story. But it cannot guide policymakers tasked with averting catastrophic warming, as many authors in this book show.", "The Green New Deal is a new policy vision\u2014one that will guide government and society through the biggest task in modern history: decarbonizing our global economy within the next ten to twenty years. The stories and details of GND policy will undoubtedly change in the coming years, but they will be anchored by the vision\u2014a conception of the problem, a set of principles, and an analysis of power\u2014that the GND provides. Vision, however, is not enough.

If the shutting down of the global economy during the first 4\u2009months of COVID-19 led to an 8\u2009percent annual decrease in carbon emissions, and this decrease is required yearly for the next 10\u2009years, nothing short of coordinated national and international action can be effective. As the logic behind the CoP15 Paris Agreement understood, in a world structured by a system of states, the state remains, in relation with other states, the effective focus for these national and international acts of coordination. One can maintain, of course, that concerted reflection on goals and their practice cannot be rehearsed within the same state system that, in co-evolution with capitalism, has produced the climate problem in the first place.24 Yet, my argument here is simple: (1) climate action must be of a political kind if this action is to be coherent and effective, and the horizon of this understanding of the political (comprehensive and effective action) is in a vital sense defined by the state; (2) this political action redounds above all to the agency and responsibility of the state both in relation to its own citizenry and in relation to other states and their citizenry. In response to the challenge of time and scale, I argue we should turn to, not turn away from, the state as an agent of change. Only if one renounces the potential of political action today through historically constituted practices of political efficacy does one shun this kind of conclusion. In which case, I would argue, one has renounced politics for our age, as well as the major emotion on which politics is based, hope.25 Since Max Weber, the state is sociologically defined by the legitimate monopoly of violence that it holds over all other forms of force within a nationally determined territory.26 There are many ways in which this monopoly is contested today. The description of a state as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 is nothing but the indication that a particular state does not hold the monopoly of violence within its territory. Prior to questions of political authority and legitimacy, all states are today vulnerable in this sense given the nature of global challenges that follow intended and unintended processes of interdependence (global financial instability, global terrorism, migration flows, pandemics, climate change, etc.). That said, the responses both to the financial crisis of 2008 and (much more so) to the present COVID-19 crisis testify to the fact that the monopoly of violence particular to the effectiveness of state governance remains in place. Among an increasing complexity of social actors, the state still holds the levers of power that are decisive in effecting social transformation. Consequently, to one side of the empirical fact that countries constitute the beef of the UNFCCC climate regime, I am arguing that the state remains the primary vehicle of a politics of climate change. As the emerging literature on the Green New Deal implies, the state can do the following. At a national level, it can organize and steer fiscal, monetary and sector-policies like those of energy, transport, agriculture, the communications industry and housing in such a way that both businesses and consumers are motivated to shift behaviour towards a carbon-neutral society. This model of the state is one of a regulated market economy that uses the coordination of state direction with market dynamism to effect broad social change. Governments respond to markets as they plan ahead with regard to climate change (the rapid fall in the price of solar and wind energy, for example), and much of the new green infrastructure is/will be locally distributed and assembled (no \u2018giant public works\u2019 given that contemporary technology is smart).27 That said, governments are the sole governance body with appropriate fiscal and monetary tools (1) to set up the rebuilding of national economies with new strategic priorities; (2) to steer and to guarantee concerted action across sectors; and (3) to guarantee, in turn, that this action is underpinned by the principles of \u2018a just transition\u2019.28 If the timeline to a 50\u2009percent reduction of carbon emissions is 2030, then the state must so organize and steer that solutions to climate change are integrated. Attention to \u2018the climate emergency\u2019 alone will not lead to the necessary change. This last point is important and suggests why the idea of the Green New Deal, whether one is on the Left or Right, harbours the appropriate response.

I have argued, first, that climate change presents an empirical global challenge that necessitates not only a normative response, but a normative response through politics if this change is not, at worst, to obliterate human possibility, human time and human space. This political response requires, second, comprehensive, integrated political action on a scale and within a timeline that is historically unprecedented. Given both the nature of the response needed and the scale and time within which this response must work, this politics must be structured, third, through the modern state system and through the economic system upon which this system was built (capitalism). In contradistinction to sub-national and post-national forms of governance, it is only the state that has the power and leverage to organize, steer and enable concerted, coordinated, intersectoral action so that a just transition to a carbon-neutral, indeed carbon-negative society is in the least possible by 2050. If it is only the state in principle that can do this, the success of its action will, at the same time, only happen through enabling other actors across society (both domestic and global) to work to the end of transition more effectively than itself \u2013 in energy markets, in local areas, in financial investment strategies for nature-based solutions, in behavioural change towards a society of limits and so forth. The argument is, consequently, not state-centric; it posits that the state, within processes of social agency and social transformation, is the sole political instance of governance, at the same time, to enable and steer in an integrated, comprehensive manner. Fourth, I argue, therefore, that, against the background of faltering global governance regimes and a renewed nationalist mindset, it is the state that bears the responsibility, both towards its own citizens and towards those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, to respond to climate change and lead, with international institutions, climate alliances among states. Finally, fifth, I have intimated that it is through these alliances that coordinated global climate action will emerge that reorganizes the development agenda beyond the distinction between North and South. A new global order could emerge from this reorganization, in response to climate change. This sequence of points means that a state-focused perspective on international politics must continue to be embraced in the discipline of IR for the coming decades. In the last 40\u2009years, and partly as a healthy intellectual reaction against the supposed domination of state-centred realism and inter-state liberalism in the discipline, there have been multiple initiatives in IR to step to one side of the state and seek the grain of international politics in other actors and processes (from Susan Strange\u2019s Retreat of the State41 to recent critical theoretical interest, as also exemplified in this SI, in the \u2018posthuman\u2019). These diverse initiatives have made the discipline intellectually richer and more inter- and pluri-disciplinary. They have, I would suggest, come at the cost, however, of losing grasp of the state where and when the state remains a necessary agent of change. This article has argued that this is foremostly the case when it comes to responding to climate change. From this perspective, continued engagement with the state as an agent of change requires that the discipline as a whole re-engages with the legacy of Weberian realism (the state and the state system), the legacy of classical realism (the ethics of the lesser violence in world of limitation) and the legacy of the English School (state responsibility and state leadership), together with the insights of constructivism, in order to reconstruct domestic and foreign policies in tight relation to climate change and its effects.42 Only, perhaps, as a result of this reconstruction can something like a reinvigorated liberal internationalism emerge that has authentically cosmopolitan aspirations: that is, aspirations that do not redound to the national interests of the more powerful states, but seek to organize, amid the risks of regression, conflict and the greater violence, a global order of sustainable development and sustainability that transcends the conceptual and practical \u2018North/South\u2019 divide. A great deal needs to be unpacked in the suggestions of the last paragraph in order to map how the various theoretical legacies in IR can be turned to the most complex human interconnection at hand: climate change. Suffice it to add here three things of import. First, the discipline\u2019s response to climate change must work across its various traditions and \u2018schools\u2019 to have ontological, epistemological, ethical and political traction upon it. I have maintained that the state must be foregrounded in this response, but this foregrounding can only make sense if the state is seen to be working in, through, and for a larger environment of actors and their practices. The discipline of IR needs to provide normative vision for, and empirical analysis of, this coordinated set of arrangements. Second, the move to deepen and reconfigure the sustainable development agenda in the light of response to climate change should, I have suggested several times, be far-reaching. Vision for, and analysis of, the ever-closer connections between the disciplines of International Relations and International Development must be forged; for example, connections based not on conflict and post-conflict scenarios, but primarily on what sustainable resilience means conceptually and policy-wise across all states and their populations. Third, and finally, a new academic mindset in the discipline may be required; or it should at least be fostered through the discipline. At a theoretical level, liberalism is considered the one \u2018optimistic\u2019 tradition within IR, a tradition predicated on belief in rational politics and cooperation, progress and embetterment. Liberalism harbours an optimism the very critique of which often defines the respective critical mindsets of realism, Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism (and) IR critical theory. These critiques have again been very rich for the discipline of IR over the last 40\u2009years, perhaps, most tellingly for the contemporary student with regard to the hubris of post-Cold War liberalisms. In the context of climate change\u2019s challenge for IR, a fierce optimism is nevertheless now required: an optimism no longer harnessed to the nineteenth- and twentieth-century terms of liberal progress, but a mindset of purpose that is focused, deftly aggressive and sustained within the logics of sustainable resilience. Given both the time and the scale of political action required for net-zero national and global societies to emerge by 2050, there is, in essence, no time to be pessimistic or sceptical; whatever happens empirically in the next 30\u2009years, there is the time to place sustained, focused pressure on political institutions and their leaders so that social transformation towards a national and global society of limits is brought about. In this sense, fiercely optimistic, bearers of the discipline of IR should assume a strong intellectual, pedagogical and social role in the three coming decades."], "id": "39c4d9e14c676126b22eb1b393638e0d88b18dec8d09565ecbe1c33a2ac5a534", "highlighted_text": " climate change obliterate human possibility on a scale and timeline that is historically unprecedented only the state has the power and leverage  to enable concerted, coordinated action The argument is not state-centric ; it posits that the state is the sole political instance of governance to steer in an integrated manner a state-focused perspective must continue to be embraced the state remains a necessary agent of change IR needs to provide normative vision for, this set of arrangements . a new academic mindset may be required; fierce optimism is now required there is no time to be pessimistic or sceptical", "highlights": [[3, 210, 224], [3, 391, 419], [3, 534, 538], [3, 539, 548], [3, 558, 566], [3, 567, 601], [3, 943, 957], [3, 963, 989], [3, 989, 989], [3, 990, 992], [3, 1013, 1019], [3, 1020, 1042], [3, 1058, 1064], [3, 1592, 1607], [3, 1623, 1640], [3, 1640, 1641], [3, 1642, 1666], [3, 1729, 1773], [3, 1793, 1795], [3, 1807, 1829], [3, 1845, 1851], [3, 2564, 2565], [3, 2566, 2591], [3, 2618, 2631], [3, 2632, 2646], [3, 3368, 3387], [3, 3388, 3413], [3, 5212, 5231], [3, 5232, 5248], [3, 5249, 5253], [3, 5281, 5285], [3, 5298, 5317], [3, 5317, 5318], [3, 5868, 5869], [3, 5870, 5890], [3, 5909, 5925], [3, 6608, 6626], [3, 6640, 6652], [3, 6998, 7006], [3, 7020, 7058]], "underlines": [[3, 210, 224], [3, 225, 390], [3, 391, 419], [3, 419, 481], [3, 491, 533], [3, 534, 538], [3, 539, 548], [3, 549, 557], [3, 558, 566], [3, 567, 601], [3, 601, 602], [3, 709, 741], [3, 750, 846], [3, 943, 957], [3, 963, 989], [3, 990, 992], [3, 992, 992], [3, 993, 1012], [3, 1013, 1019], [3, 1020, 1042], [3, 1042, 1057], [3, 1058, 1064], [3, 1065, 1175], [3, 1236, 1262], [3, 1282, 1338], [3, 1592, 1607], [3, 1607, 1622], [3, 1623, 1640], [3, 1642, 1666], [3, 1666, 1728], [3, 1729, 1773], [3, 1773, 1792], [3, 1793, 1795], [3, 1796, 1806], [3, 1807, 1829], [3, 1829, 1844], [3, 1845, 1851], [3, 2529, 2552], [3, 2553, 2563], [3, 2564, 2565], [3, 2566, 2591], [3, 2592, 2617], [3, 2618, 2631], [3, 2632, 2646], [3, 2647, 2693], [3, 2866, 2902], [3, 2909, 2941], [3, 3111, 3122], [3, 3135, 3153], [3, 3156, 3161], [3, 3170, 3228], [3, 3269, 3279], [3, 3297, 3313], [3, 3324, 3339], [3, 3340, 3367], [3, 3368, 3387], [3, 3388, 3413], [3, 3452, 3462], [3, 3472, 3488], [3, 3503, 3517], [3, 3542, 3577], [3, 3600, 3628], [3, 3640, 3669], [3, 3679, 3686], [3, 3894, 3951], [3, 3952, 3993], [3, 3994, 4045], [3, 4795, 4968], [3, 4994, 5024], [3, 5043, 5192], [3, 5194, 5211], [3, 5212, 5231], [3, 5232, 5248], [3, 5249, 5253], [3, 5254, 5280], [3, 5281, 5285], [3, 5286, 5297], [3, 5298, 5317], [3, 5868, 5869], [3, 5870, 5890], [3, 5891, 5908], [3, 5909, 5925], [3, 5984, 6007], [3, 6008, 6063], [3, 6173, 6208], [3, 6209, 6269], [3, 6270, 6278], [3, 6353, 6373], [3, 6380, 6413], [3, 6553, 6604], [3, 6606, 6607], [3, 6608, 6626], [3, 6627, 6639], [3, 6640, 6652], [3, 6654, 6685], [3, 6686, 6688], [3, 6736, 6752], [3, 6754, 6871], [3, 6873, 6935], [3, 6998, 7006], [3, 7020, 7058], [3, 7321, 7466]], "emphasis": [[3, 391, 419], [3, 539, 548], [3, 549, 557], [3, 558, 566], [3, 963, 989], [3, 993, 1012], [3, 1013, 1019], [3, 1623, 1640], [3, 2566, 2591], [3, 2618, 2631], [3, 3297, 3313], [3, 3324, 3339], [3, 3388, 3413], [3, 3952, 3993], [3, 5232, 5248], [3, 5870, 5890], [3, 6209, 6269], [3, 6606, 6607], [3, 6608, 6626], [3, 6627, 6639], [3, 6640, 6652], [3, 6736, 6752], [3, 7020, 7058]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 20]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-01"}, {"tag": "Political battle over positive vision of national sovereignty key to defeat fascism.", "cite": "William MITCHELL Economics @ Newcastle AND Thomas FAZI  \u201917 Reclaiming the State: A Progressive Vision of Sovereignty in a Post-Neoliberal World  p. 3-12", "body": ["Given neoliberalism\u2019s war against sovereignty, it should come as no surprise that \u2018sovereignty has become the master-frame of contemporary politics\u2019, as Paolo Gerbaudo notes.4 After all, as we argue in Chapter 5, the hollowing out of national sovereignty and curtailment of popular-democratic mechanisms \u2013 what has been termed depoliticisation \u2013 has been an essential element of the neoliberal project, aimed at insulating macroeconomic policies from popular contestation and removing any obstacles put in the way of economic exchanges and financial flows. Given the nefarious effects of depoliticisation, it is only natural that the revolt against neoliberalism should first and foremost take the form of demands for a repoliticisation of national decision-making processes. The fact that the vision of national sovereignty that was at the centre of the Trump and Brexit campaigns, and that currently dominates the public discourse, is a reactionary, quasi-fascist one \u2013 mostly defined along ethnic, exclusivist and authoritarian lines \u2013 should not be seen as an indictment of national sovereignty as such.

The problem, in short, is not national sovereignty as such, but the fact that the concept in recent years has been largely monopolised by the right and extreme right, which understandably sees it as a way to push through its xenophobic and identitarian agenda. It would therefore be a grave mistake to explain away the seduction of the \u2018Trumpenproletariat\u2019 by the far right as a case of false consciousness, as Marc Saxer notes;5 the working classes are simply turning to the only movements and parties that (so far) promise them some protection from the brutal currents of neoliberal globalisation (whether they can or truly intend to deliver on that promise is a different matter).", "However, this simply raises an even bigger question: why has the left not been able to offer the working classes and increasingly proletarianised middle classes a credible alternative to neoliberalism and to neoliberal globalisation? More to the point, why has it not been able to develop a progressive view of national sovereignty? As we argue in this book, the reasons are numerous and overlapping. For starters, it is important to understand that the current existential crisis of the left has very deep historical roots, reaching as far back as the 1960s. If we want to comprehend how the left has gone astray, that is where we have to begin our analysis.", "Today the post-war \u2018Keynesian\u2019 era is eulogised by many on the left as a golden age in which organised labour and enlightened thinkers and policymakers (such as Keynes himself) were able to impose a \u2018class compromise\u2019 on reluctant capitalists that delivered unprecedented levels of social progress, which were subsequently rolled back following the so-called neoliberal counter-revolution. It is thus argued that, in order to overcome neoliberalism, all it takes is for enough members of the establishment to be swayed by an alternative set of ideas. However, as we note in Chapter 2, the rise and fall of Keynesianism cannot simply be explained in terms of working-class strength or the victory of one ideology over another, but should instead be viewed as the outcome of the fortuitous confluence, in the aftermath of World War II, of a number of social, ideological, political, economic, technical and institutional conditions.", "To fail to do so is to commit the same mistake that many leftists committed in the early post-war years. By failing to appreciate the extent to which the class compromise at the base of the Fordist-Keynesian system was, in fact, a crucial component of that history-specific regime of accumulation \u2013 actively supported by the capitalist class insofar as it was conducive to profit-making, and bound to be jettisoned once it ceased to be so \u2013 many socialists of the time convinced themselves \u2018that they had done much more than they actually had to shift the balance of class power, and the relationship between states and markets\u2019.6 Some even argued that the developed world had already entered a post-capitalist phase, in which all the characteristic features of capitalism had been permanently eliminated, thanks to a fundamental shift of power in favour of labour vis-\u00e0-vis capital, and of the state vis-\u00e0-vis the market. Needless to say, that was not the case. Furthermore, as we show in Chapter 3, monetarism \u2013 the ideological precursor to neoliberalism \u2013 had already started to percolate into left-wing policymaking circles as early as the late 1960s.", "Thus, as argued in Chapters 2 and 3, many on the left found themselves lacking the necessary theoretical tools to understand \u2013 and correctly respond to \u2013 the capitalist crisis that engulfed the Keynesian model in the 1970s, convincing themselves that the distributional struggle that arose at the time could be resolved within the narrow limits of the social-democratic framework. The truth of the matter was that the labour\u2013capital conflict that re-emerged in the 1970s could only have been resolved one way or another: on capital\u2019s terms, through a reduction of labour\u2019s bargaining power, or on labour\u2019s terms, through an extension of the state\u2019s control over investment and production. As we show in Chapters 3 and 4, with regard to the experience of the social-democratic governments of Britain and France in the 1970s and 1980s, the left proved unwilling to go this way. This left it (no pun intended) with no other choice but to \u2018manage the capitalist crisis on behalf of capital\u2019, as Stuart Hall wrote, by ideologically and politically legitimising neoliberalism as the only solution to the survival of capitalism.7 ", "In this regard, as we show in Chapter 3, the Labour government of James Callaghan (1974\u20139) bears a very heavy responsibility. In an (in)famous speech in 1976, Callaghan justified the government\u2019s programme of spending cuts and wage restraint by declaring Keynesianism dead, indirectly legitimising the emerging monetarist (neoliberal) dogma and effectively setting up the conditions for Labour\u2019s \u2018austerity lite\u2019 to be refined into an all-out attack on the working class by Margaret Thatcher. Even worse, perhaps, Callaghan popularised the notion that austerity was the only solution to the economic crisis of the 1970s, anticipating Thatcher\u2019s \u2018there is no alternative\u2019 (TINA) mantra, even though there were radical alternatives available at the time, such as those put forward by Tony Benn and others. These, however, were \u2018no longer perceived to exist\u2019.8 In this sense, the dismantling of the post-war Keynesian framework cannot simply be explained as the victory of one ideology (\u2018neoliberalism\u2019) over another (\u2018Keynesianism\u2019), but should rather be understood as the result of a number of overlapping ideological, economic and political factors: the capitalists\u2019 response to the profit squeeze and to the political implications of full employment policies; the structural flaws of \u2018actually existing Keynesianism\u2019; and, importantly, the left\u2019s inability to offer a coherent response to the crisis of the Keynesian framework, let alone a radical alternative. These are all analysed in-depth in the first chapters of the book.", "Furthermore, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a new (fallacious) left consensus started to set in: that economic and financial internationalisation \u2013 what today we call \u2018globalisation\u2019 \u2013 had rendered the state increasingly powerless vis-\u00e0-vis \u2018the forces of the market\u2019, and that therefore countries had little choice but to abandon national economic strategies and all the traditional instruments of intervention in the economy (such as tariffs and other trade barriers, capital controls, currency and exchange rate manipulation, and fiscal and central bank policies), and hope, at best, for transnational or supranational forms of economic governance. In other words, government intervention in the economy came to be seen not only as ineffective but, increasingly, as outright impossible. This process \u2013 which was generally (and erroneously, as we shall see) framed as a shift from the state to the market \u2013 was accompanied by a ferocious attack on the very idea of national sovereignty, increasingly vilified as a relic of the past. As we show, the left \u2013 in particular the European left \u2013 played a crucial role in this regard as well, by cementing this ideological shift towards a post-national and post-sovereign view of the world, often anticipating the right on these issues.", "One of the most consequential turning points in this respect, which is analysed in Chapter 4, was Mitterrand\u2019s 1983 turn to austerity \u2013 the so-called tournant de la rigueur \u2013 just two years after the French Socialists\u2019 historic victory in 1981. Mitterrand\u2019s election had inspired the widespread belief that a radical break with capitalism \u2013 at least with the extreme form of capitalism that had recently taken hold in the Anglo-Saxon world \u2013 was still possible. By 1983, however, the French Socialists had succeeded in \u2018proving\u2019 the exact opposite: that neoliberal globalisation was an inescapable and inevitable reality. As Mitterrand stated at the time: \u2018National sovereignty no longer means very much, or has much scope in the modern world economy. \u2026 A high degree of supra-nationality is essential.\u20199", "The repercussions of Mitterrand\u2019s about-turn are still being felt today. It is often brandished by left-wing and progressive intellectuals as proof of the fact that globalisation and the internationalisation of finance has ended the era of nation states and their capacity to pursue policies that are not in accord with the diktats of global capital. The claim is that if a government tries autonomously to pursue full employment and a progressive/redistributive agenda, it will inevitably be punished by the amorphous forces of global capital. This narrative claims that Mitterrand had no option but to abandon his agenda of radical reform. To most modern-day leftists, Mitterrand thus represents a pragmatist who was cognisant of the international capitalist forces he was up against and responsible enough to do what was best for France.", "In fact, as we argue in the second part of the book, sovereign, currency-issuing states \u2013 such as France in the 1980s \u2013 far from being helpless against the power of global capital, still have the capacity to deliver full employment and social justice to their citizens. So how did the idea of the \u2018death of the state\u2019 come to be so ingrained in our collective consciousness? As we explain in Chapter 5, underlying this post-national view of the world was (is) a failure to understand \u2013 and in some cases an explicit attempt to conceal \u2013 on behalf of left-wing intellectuals and policymakers that \u2018globalisation\u2019 was (is) not the result of inexorable economic and technological changes but was (is) largely the product of state-driven processes. All the elements that we associate with neoliberal globalisation \u2013 delocalisation, deindustrialisation, the free movement of goods and capital, etc. \u2013 were (are), in most cases, the result of choices made by governments. More generally, states continue to play a crucial role in promoting, enforcing and sustaining a (neo)liberal international framework \u2013 though that would appear to be changing, as we discuss in Chapter 6 \u2013 as well as establishing the domestic conditions for allowing global accumulation to flourish.", "The same can be said of neoliberalism tout court. There is a widespread belief \u2013 particularly among the left \u2013 that neoliberalism has involved (and involves) a \u2018retreat\u2019, \u2018hollowing out\u2019 or \u2018withering away\u2019 of the state, which in turn has fuelled the notion that today the state has been \u2018overpowered\u2019 by the market. However, as we argue in Chapter 5, neoliberalism has not entailed a retreat of the state but rather a reconfiguration of the state, aimed at placing the commanding heights of economic policy \u2018in the hands of capital, and primarily financial interests\u2019.10", "It is self-evident, after all, that the process of neoliberalisation would not have been possible if governments \u2013 and in particular social-democratic governments \u2013 had not resorted to a wide array of tools to promote it: the liberalisation of goods and capital markets; the privatisation of resources and social services; the deregulation of business, and financial markets in particular; the reduction of workers\u2019 rights (first and foremost, the right to collective bargaining) and more generally the repression of labour activism; the lowering of taxes on wealth and capital, at the expense of the middle and working classes; the slashing of social programmes; and so on. These policies were systemically pursued throughout the West (and imposed on developing countries) with unprecedented determination, and with the support of all the major international institutions and political parties.", "As noted in Chapter 5, even the loss of national sovereignty \u2013 which has been invoked in the past, and continues to be invoked today, to justify neoliberal policies \u2013 is largely the result of a willing and conscious limitation of state sovereign rights by national elites. The reason why governments chose willingly to \u2018tie their hands\u2019 is all too clear: as the European case epitomises, the creation of self-imposed \u2018external constraints\u2019 allowed national politicians to reduce the politics costs of the neoliberal transition \u2013 which clearly involved unpopular policies \u2013 by \u2018scapegoating\u2019 institutionalised rules and \u2018independent\u2019 or international institutions, which in turn were presented as an inevitable outcome of the new, harsh realities of globalisation.", "Moreover, neoliberalism has been (and is) associated with various forms of authoritarian statism \u2013 that is, the opposite of the minimal state advocated by neoliberals \u2013 as states have bolstered their security and policing arms as part of a generalised militarisation of civil protest. In other words, not only does neoliberal economic policy require the presence of a strong state, but it requires the presence of an authoritarian state (particularly where extreme forms of neoliberalism are concerned, such as the ones experimented with in periphery countries), at both the domestic and international level (see Chapter 5). In this sense, neoliberal ideology, at least in its official anti-state guise, should be considered little more than a convenient alibi for what has been and is essentially a political and state-driven project. Capital remains as dependent on the state today as it was under \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 \u2013 to police the working classes, bail out large firms that would otherwise go bankrupt, open up markets abroad (including through military intervention), etc. The ultimate irony, or indecency, is that traditional left establishment parties have become standard-bearers for neoliberalism themselves, both while in elected office and in opposition.", "In the months and years that followed the financial crash of 2007\u20139, capital\u2019s \u2013 and capitalism\u2019s \u2013 continued dependency on the state in the age of neoliberalism became glaringly obvious, as the governments of the US, Europe and elsewhere bailed out their respective financial institutions to the tune of trillions of euros/dollars. In Europe, following the outbreak of the so-called \u2018euro crisis\u2019 in 2010, this was accompanied by a multi-level assault on the post-war European social and economic model aimed at restructuring and re-engineering European societies and economies along lines more favourable to capital. This radical reconfiguration of European societies \u2013 which, again, has seen social-democratic governments at the forefront \u2013 is not based on a retreat of the state in favour of the market, but rather on a reintensification of state intervention on the side of capital.", "Nonetheless, the erroneous idea of the waning nation state has become an entrenched fixture of the left. As we argue throughout the book, we consider this to be central in understanding the decline of the traditional political left and its acquiescence to neoliberalism. In view of the above, it is hardly surprising that the mainstream left is, today, utterly incapable of offering a positive vision of national sovereignty in response to neoliberal globalisation. To make matters worse, most leftists have bought into the macroeconomic myths that the establishment uses to discourage any alternative use of state fiscal capacities. For example, they have accepted without question the so-called household budget analogy, which suggests that currency-issuing governments, like households, are financially constrained, and that fiscal deficits impose crippling debt burdens on future generations \u2013 a notion that we thoroughly debunk in Chapter 8.", "This has gone hand in hand with another, equally tragic, development. As discussed in Chapter 5, following its historical defeat, the left\u2019s traditional anti-capitalist focus on class slowly gave way to a liberal individualist understanding of emancipation. Waylaid by post-modernist and post-structuralist theories, left intellectuals slowly abandoned Marxian class categories to focus, instead, on elements of political power and the use of language and narratives as a way of establishing meaning. This also defined new arenas of political struggle that were diametrically opposed to those defined by Marx. Over the past three decades, the left focus on \u2018capitalism\u2019 has given way to a focus on issues such as racism, gender, homophobia, multiculturalism, etc. Marginality is no longer described in terms of class but rather in terms of identity. The struggle against the illegitimate hegemony of the capitalist class has given way to the struggles of a variety of (more or less) oppressed and marginalised groups: women, ethnic and racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, etc. As a result, class struggle has ceased to be seen as the path to liberation.", "In this new post-modernist world, only categories that transcend Marxian class boundaries are considered meaningful. Moreover, the institutions that evolved to defend workers against capital \u2013 such as trade unions and social-democratic political parties \u2013 have become subjugated to these non-class struggle foci. What has emerged in practically all Western countries as a result, as Nancy Fraser notes, is a perverse political alignment between \u2018mainstream currents of new social movements (feminism, anti-racism, multiculturalism, and LGBTQ rights), on the one side, and high-end \u201csymbolic\u201d and service-based business sectors (Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood), on the other\u2019.11 The result is a progressive neoliberalism \u2018that mix[es] together truncated ideals of emancipation and lethal forms of financialization\u2019, with the former unwittingly lending their charisma to the latter.", "As societies have become increasingly divided between well-educated, highly mobile, highly skilled, socially progressive cosmopolitan urbanites, and lower-skilled and less educated peripherals who rarely work abroad and face competition from immigrants, the mainstream left has tended to consistently side with the former. Indeed, the split between the working classes and the intellectual-cultural left can be considered one of the main reasons behind the right-wing revolt currently engulfing the West. As argued by Jonathan Haidt, the way the globalist urban elites talk and act unwittingly activates authoritarian tendencies in a subset of nationalists.12 In a vicious feedback loop, however, the more the working classes turn to right-wing populism and nationalism, the more the intellectual-cultural left doubles down on its liberal-cosmopolitan fantasies, further radicalising the ethno-nationalism of the proletariat. As Wolfgang Streeck writes:", "Protests against material and moral degradation are suspected of being essentially fascist, especially now that the former advocates of the plebeian classes have switched to the globalization party, so that if their former clients wish to complain about the pressures of capitalist modernization, the only language at their disposal is the pre-political, untreated linguistic raw material of everyday experiences of deprivation, economic or cultural. This results in constant breaches of the rules of civilized public speech, which in turn can trigger indignation at the top and mobilization at the bottom.13", "This is particularly evident in the European debate, where, despite the disastrous effects of the EU and monetary union, the mainstream left \u2013 often appealing to exactly the same arguments used by Callaghan and Mitterrand 30\u201340 years ago \u2013 continues to cling on to these institutions and to the belief that they can be reformed in a progressive direction, despite all evidence to the contrary, and to dismiss any talk of restoring a progressive agenda on the foundation of retrieved national sovereignty as a \u2018retreat into nationalist positions\u2019, inevitably bound to plunge the continent into 1930s-style fascism.14 This position, as irrational as it may be, is not surprising, considering that European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is, after all, a brainchild of the European left (see Chapter 5). However, such a position presents numerous problems, which are ultimately rooted in a failure to understand the true nature of the EU and monetary union. First of all, it ignores the fact that the EU\u2019s economic and political constitution is structured to produce the results that we are seeing \u2013 the erosion of popular sovereignty, the massive transfer of wealth from the middle and lower classes to the upper classes, the weakening of labour and more generally the rollback of the democratic and social/economic gains that had previously been achieved by subordinate classes \u2013 and is designed precisely to impede the kind of radical reforms to which progressive integrationists or federalists aspire to.", "More importantly, however, it effectively reduces the left to the role of defender of the status quo, thus allowing the political right to hegemonise the legitimate anti-systemic \u2013 and specifically anti-EU \u2013 grievances of citizens. This is tantamount to relinquishing the discursive and political battleground for a post-neoliberal hegemony \u2013 which is inextricably linked to the question of national sovereignty \u2013 to the right and extreme right. It is not hard to see that if progressive change can only be implemented at the global or even European level \u2013 in other words, if the alternative to the status quo offered to electorates is one between reactionary nationalism and progressive globalism \u2013 then the left has already lost the battle."], "id": "0cbcc5aaca427f7edbea274310a1f35659cf71997cbfbff065f9fddd2ca95546", "highlighted_text": " hollowing out of national sovereignty and curtailment of democratic mechanisms has been essential all the major social, economic and political advancements of the past centuries were achieved through the democratic nation state a new (fallacious consensus started globalisation \u2019 rendered the state increasingly powerless globalisation \u2019 was the product of state-driven choices neoliberalism is) associated with authoritarian statism Capital remains as dependent on the state today as under \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 the left\u2019s traditional anti-capitalist focus gave way to a liberal individualist understanding", "highlights": [[2, 217, 273], [2, 282, 303], [2, 346, 354], [2, 358, 367], [3, 98, 199], [3, 220, 247], [9, 45, 62], [9, 69, 86], [9, 169, 182], [9, 182, 183], [9, 190, 231], [12, 597, 610], [12, 610, 615], [12, 706, 733], [12, 937, 944], [16, 10, 23], [16, 38, 57], [16, 75, 96], [16, 836, 886], [16, 894, 914], [19, 130, 174], [19, 191, 240]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 148], [2, 213, 216], [2, 217, 273], [2, 274, 282], [2, 282, 303], [2, 346, 354], [2, 355, 357], [2, 358, 367], [2, 368, 450], [2, 459, 471], [2, 790, 840], [2, 841, 847], [2, 848, 881], [2, 883, 886], [2, 902, 969], [2, 979, 986], [2, 987, 992], [2, 1001, 1012], [2, 1013, 1036], [3, 98, 199], [3, 200, 219], [3, 220, 247], [3, 247, 260], [3, 261, 275], [3, 276, 288], [3, 289, 305], [3, 306, 318], [3, 320, 325], [3, 346, 350], [3, 361, 407], [4, 53, 92], [4, 289, 331], [9, 13, 44], [9, 45, 62], [9, 62, 68], [9, 69, 86], [9, 87, 125], [9, 126, 146], [9, 147, 169], [9, 169, 182], [9, 182, 183], [9, 184, 189], [9, 190, 231], [9, 232, 268], [9, 270, 273], [9, 274, 278], [9, 289, 427], [12, 597, 610], [12, 610, 615], [12, 616, 705], [12, 706, 733], [12, 734, 743], [12, 812, 826], [12, 826, 827], [12, 828, 847], [12, 847, 887], [12, 894, 936], [12, 937, 944], [12, 945, 964], [15, 273, 353], [15, 389, 526], [15, 573, 590], [15, 591, 608], [15, 609, 614], [16, 10, 23], [16, 38, 57], [16, 75, 96], [16, 169, 226], [16, 836, 886], [16, 887, 893], [16, 894, 914], [16, 915, 1002], [16, 1003, 1010], [16, 1011, 1067], [18, 489, 632], [19, 130, 174], [19, 191, 240], [19, 241, 257]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[8, 16], [39, 42], [50, 54], [56, 57], [57, 59]], "filename": "neg-5.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-03-12"}, {"tag": "Some version of nationalism is inevitable-progressive nationalism undermines the source of neoliberal power", "cite": "William MITCHELL Economics @ Newcastle AND Thomas FAZI  \u201917 Reclaiming the State: A Progressive Vision of Sovereignty in a Post-Neoliberal World  p. 155-158", "body": ["", "What we are witnessing is not the end of globalisation \u2013 which will continue, although it will likely be characterised by increased tensions between the various fractions of international capital, particularly between the US, Germany, Japan and China, and by a combination of protectionism and internationalisation \u2013 but rather the birth of a post-neoliberal order. From a historical perspective, there was no reason to believe that neoliberalism would go on indefinitely. As we saw in Chapter 2, each distinctive stage of capitalist development is based on a specific accumulation strategy or hegemonic project, which derives its strength from its ability to guarantee economic growth and profit across a nation or region, while at the same time satisfying different social groups. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis. In this sense, just like Keynesianism fell into crisis in the 1970s and was supplanted by neoliberalism as the dominant accumulation regime, we can expect neoliberalism \u2013 now facing a crisis of its own \u2013 to give way to a new configuration of capitalism. The difference between then and now is that there is no new coherent ideology or accumulation regime waiting in the wings to replace neoliberalism. But we can be sure that it will involve the currency-issuing state as a central player (for example, the Chinese state is driving massive changes in global capitalism through its use of fiscal deficits and planned development).", "The vague neo-protectionist and neo-nationalist rhetoric of \u2018global Trumpism\u2019, to use Mark Blyth\u2019s apt definition,12 does not yet represent a new hegemonic force \u2013 as testified by the huge rift that it has opened within established political, economic and cultural elites. In other words, it is too early to say what this post-neoliberal order will look like. Antonio Gramsci famously described organic crises such as the one that we are currently going through as situations in which \u2018the old is dying and the new cannot yet be born\u2019. \u2018In this interregnum\u2019, he wrote, \u2018a great variety of morbid symptoms\u2019 \u2013 such as the ones that we have described above \u2013 tend to appear.13 If the future looks bleak, however, it is not because neoliberalism is inexorably destined to be supplanted by some form of twentieth-century fascism, as most mainstream and \u2013 alas \u2013 left analyses would have us believe, which inevitably leads to the conclusion that \u2018reforming the status quo\u2019 is the only viable alternative. No: what has allowed these \u2018morbid symptoms\u2019 to emerge as the dominant reaction to neoliberalism and globalisation is simply the fact that right-wing forces have been much more effective than left-wing or progressive forces at tapping into the legitimate grievances of the masses that have been disenfranchised, marginalised, impoverished and dispossessed by the 40-year-long neoliberal class war waged from above.", "In particular, they are the only forces that have been able to provide a (more or less) coherent response to the widespread \u2013 and growing \u2013 yearning for greater territorial or national sovereignty, increasingly seen as the only way to \u2018take back\u2019 some degree of collective control over politics and society. Given neoliberalism\u2019s war against sovereignty, it should come as no surprise that \u2018sovereignty has become the master-frame of contemporary politics\u2019, as Paolo Gerbaudo notes.14 As we have already seen, the hollowing out of national sovereignty and curtailment of popular-democratic mechanisms \u2013 what has been termed depoliticisation \u2013 has been an essential element of the neoliberal project, aimed at insulating macroeconomic policies from popular contestation and removing any obstacles put in the way of economic exchanges and financial flows. Given the nefarious effects of depoliticisation, it is only natural that the revolt against neoliberalism should first and foremost take the form of demands for a repoliticisation of national decision-making processes \u2013 that is, for a greater degree of democratic control over politics (and particularly over the destructive global flows unleashed by neoliberalism), which necessarily can only be exercised at the national level, in the absence of effective supranational mechanisms of representation. The European Union is obviously no exception: in fact, it is (correctly) seen by many as the embodiment of technocratic rule and elite estrangement from the masses, as demonstrated by the Brexit vote and the widespread euroscepticism engulfing the continent.", "The fact that the vision of national sovereignty that was at the centre of the Trump and Brexit campaigns, and that currently dominates the public discourse, is a reactionary, quasi-fascist one \u2013 mostly defined along ethnic, exclusivist and isolationist lines, aimed at ensuring the security and protection of the \u2018national community\u2019 against the threat posed by a variety of internal and external enemies (minorities, migrants, Muslims, foreigners in general) and based on an even more exploitative and authoritarian form of capitalism \u2013 should not be seen as an indictment of national sovereignty as such. History attests to the fact that national sovereignty and national self-determination are not intrinsically reactionary or jingoistic concepts \u2013 in fact, they constituted foundational notions in the development of the modern left, seen in the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and its influence on the Jacobins and the French revolution, and were the rallying cries of countless nineteenth and twentieth-century socialist and left-wing liberation movements. Even if we limit our analysis to core capitalist countries, it is patently obvious that virtually all the major social, economic and political advancements of the past centuries were achieved through the institutions of the democratic nation state, not through international, multilateral or supranational institutions, which in a number of ways have, in fact, been used to roll back those very achievements, as seen throughout this book. The problem, in short, is not national sovereignty as such, but the fact that the concept in recent years has been largely monopolised by the right and extreme right, which understandably sees it as a way to push through its xenophobic and identitarian agenda.", "So why has the contemporary left not been able to develop an alternative, progressive view of national sovereignty in response to neoliberal globalisation? The answer should be clear by now: over the course of the past 30 years, most strands of left-wing or progressive thought have accepted the notion that national states have essentially been rendered obsolete by neoliberalism and/or globalisation and thus that meaningful change can only be achieved at the international/supranational level or \u2013 even worse \u2013 have come to view national sovereignty as an inherently reactionary construct, synonymous with international conflict and repressive control over migration.15 Furthermore, as we discuss in detail in the second part of the book, most leftists have also bought into the macroeconomic myths that the establishment uses to discourage any alternative use of state fiscal capacities. For example, they have accepted without question the so-called household budget analogy, which suggests that currency-issuing governments, like households, face financial constraints and thus must limit their spending or face sanctions from private bond markets. The latter are claimed to be able to starve governments of funds and force them to run out of money. The idea that a currency-issuing government can run out of money is, of course, nonsensical, but through careful framing and use of language, it has become a widely held belief in the general public debate \u2013 and among the left.", "This is particularly evident in the European debate, where, despite the disastrous effects of the EU and monetary union, the left to a large extent continues to cling on to these institutions and to the belief that they can be reformed in a progressive direction, despite all evidence to the contrary, and to dismiss any talk of restoring a progressive agenda on the foundation of retrieved national sovereignty as a \u2018retreat into nationalist positions\u2019, inevitably bound to plunge the continent into 1930s-style fascism.16 This, however, is tantamount to relinquishing the discursive and political battleground for a post-neoliberal hegemony \u2013 which, as we have seen, is inextricably linked to the question of national sovereignty \u2013 to the right and extreme right. It is not hard to see that if progressive change can only be implemented at the global or even European level \u2013 in other words, if the alternative to the status quo offered to electorates is one between reactionary nationalism and progressive globalism \u2013 then the left has already lost the battle.", "It needn\u2019t be this way, however. A vision of national sovereignty which offers a radical alternative to that of both the right and the neoliberals \u2013 one based on popular sovereignty, democratic control over the economy, full employment, social justice, redistribution from the rich to the poor, inclusivity, and more generally the socio-ecological transformation of production and society \u2013 is not only necessary, it is possible. The fiscal capacity of the currency-issuing state remains intact and can be used to advance these objectives just as it has been used to \u2018fund\u2019 neoliberalism. This alternative is also the necessary prerequisite for the construction of a new international(ist) world order, based on interdependent but independent sovereign states. It is such a vision that we present in the second part of this book.", ""], "id": "ba9c38498d64b71d54cc4e9c78e7680a627fb12d96f1dd8985c09064b89f7515", "highlighted_text": " If the future looks bleak it is not because neoliberalism is inexorably destined to be supplanted by fascism right-wing forces have been more effective at tapping into the grievances of the masses national sovereignty and curtailment of democratic mechanisms has been essential revolt against neoliberalism should first and foremost take demands for greater democratic control over politics most strands of progressive thought have accepted the notion that states have been rendered obsolete synonymous with international conflict This is relinquishing the battleground for a post-neoliberal hegemony", "highlights": [[4, 674, 699], [4, 710, 784], [4, 816, 823], [4, 1138, 1165], [4, 1171, 1185], [4, 1223, 1242], [4, 1254, 1278], [5, 531, 570], [5, 579, 600], [5, 643, 651], [5, 655, 664], [5, 931, 990], [5, 1003, 1014], [5, 1089, 1096], [5, 1107, 1139], [7, 229, 244], [7, 258, 307], [7, 317, 328], [7, 341, 363], [7, 593, 631], [8, 524, 528], [8, 539, 541], [8, 556, 573], [8, 599, 642]], "underlines": [[4, 368, 534], [4, 674, 699], [4, 699, 709], [4, 710, 784], [4, 785, 815], [4, 816, 823], [4, 823, 832], [4, 833, 843], [4, 844, 847], [4, 857, 892], [4, 1001, 1053], [4, 1138, 1165], [4, 1166, 1170], [4, 1171, 1185], [4, 1186, 1222], [4, 1223, 1242], [4, 1243, 1253], [4, 1254, 1278], [4, 1279, 1310], [4, 1311, 1323], [4, 1323, 1412], [5, 531, 570], [5, 571, 572], [5, 572, 579], [5, 579, 600], [5, 643, 651], [5, 652, 654], [5, 655, 664], [5, 665, 852], [5, 928, 930], [5, 931, 990], [5, 991, 1002], [5, 1003, 1014], [5, 1015, 1016], [5, 1017, 1033], [5, 1034, 1061], [5, 1062, 1071], [5, 1084, 1088], [5, 1089, 1096], [5, 1097, 1106], [5, 1107, 1139], [5, 1140, 1282], [6, 14, 48], [6, 58, 64], [6, 65, 71], [6, 72, 193], [6, 203, 210], [6, 211, 216], [6, 225, 236], [6, 539, 598], [6, 599, 607], [6, 641, 837], [6, 943, 1061], [7, 229, 244], [7, 245, 257], [7, 258, 307], [7, 308, 316], [7, 317, 328], [7, 329, 340], [7, 341, 363], [7, 514, 592], [7, 593, 631], [8, 524, 528], [8, 539, 541], [8, 542, 555], [8, 556, 573], [8, 574, 598], [8, 599, 642], [9, 33, 413], [9, 414, 419], [9, 420, 428]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[8, 16], [39, 42], [50, 54], [56, 57], [57, 59]], "filename": "neg-5.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "CASE", "cite": "1NC", "body": ["Hallward \u20186 [Peter; Professor of Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London, Out of This World: Deleuze and the Philosophy of Creation, p162-163]", "Deleuze writes a philosophy of (virtual) difference without (actual) others. He intuits a purely internal or self-differing difference, a difference that excludes any constitutive mediation between the differed. Such a philosophy precludes a distinctively relational conception of politics as a matter of course. The politics of the future are likely to depend less on virtual mobility than on more resilient forms of cohesion, on more principled forms of commitment, on more integrated forms of coordination, on more resistant forms of defence. Rather than align ourselves with the nomadic war machine, our first task should be to develop appropriate ways of responding to the newly aggressive techniques of invasion, penetration and occupation which serve to police the embattled margins of empire. In a perverse twist of fate, it may be that today, in places like Palestine, Haiti and Iraq, the agents of imperialism have more to learn from Deleuzian rhizomatics than do their opponents.17 As we have repeatedly seen, the second corollary of Deleuze\u2019s disqualification of actuality concerns the paralysis of the subject or actor. Since what powers Deleuze\u2019s cosmology is the immediate differentiation of creation through the infinite proliferation of virtual creatings, the creatures that actualize these creatings are confined to a derivative if not limiting role. A creature\u2019s own interests, actions or decisions are of minimal or preliminary significance at best: the renewal of creation always requires the paralysis and dissolution of the creature per se. The notion of a constrained or situated freedom, the notion that a subject\u2019s own decisions might have genuine consequences \u2013 the whole notion, in short, of strategy \u2013 is thoroughly foreign to Deleuze\u2019s conception of thought. Deleuze obliges us, in other words, to make an absolute distinction between what a subject does or decides and what is done or decided through the subject. By rendering this distinction absolute he abandons the category of the subject altogether. He abandons the decisive subject in favour of our more immediate subjection to the imperatives of creative life or thought. Deprived of any strategic apparatus, Deleuze\u2019s philosophy thus combines the self-grounding sufficiency of pure force or infinite perfection with our symmetrical limitation to pure contemplation or in-action. On the one hand, Deleuze always maintains that \u2018there are never any criteria other than the tenor of existence, the intensification of life\u2019. Absolute life or creation tolerates no norm external to itself. The creative movement that orients us out of the world does not depend on a transcendent value beyond the world. After Spinoza, after Nietzsche, Deleuze rejects all forms of moral evaluation or strategic judgment. Every instance of decision, every confrontation with the question \u2018what should we do?\u2019, is to be resolved exclusively in terms of what we can do. An individual\u2019s power or capacity is also its \u2018natural right\u2019, and the answer to the question of what an individual or body should do is again simplicity itself \u2013 it should go and will always go \u2018as far as it can\u2019 (WP, 74; EP, 258). But on the other hand, we know that an individual can only do this because its power is not that of the individual itself. By doing what it can, an individual only provides a vessel for the power that works through it, and which alone acts \u2013 or rather, which alone is. What impels u to \u2018persevere in our being\u2019 has nothing to do with us as such. So when, in the conclusion of their last joint project, Deleuze and Guattari observe the \u2018vitalism has always had two possible interpretations\u2019, it is not surprising that they should opt for the resolutely in-active interpretation. Vitalism, they explain, can be conceived either in terms of \u2018an Idea that acts but is not, and that acts therefore only from the point of view of an external cerebral knowledge; or of a force that is but does not act, and which is therefore a pure internal Feeling [Sentir]\u2019. Deleuze and Guattari embrace this second interpretation, they choose Leibnizian being over Kantian act, precisely because it disables action in favour of contemplation. It suspends any relation between a living and the lived, between a knowing and the know, between a creating and the created. They embrace it because what feeling \u2018preserves is always in a state of detachment in relation to action and even to movement, and appears as a pure contemplation without knowledge\u2019. As Deleuze understands, living contemplation proceeds at an immeasurable distance from what is merely lived, known or decided. Life lives and creation creates on a virtual plane that leads forever out of our actual world. Few philosophers have been as inspiring as Deleuze. But those of us who still seek to change our world and to empower its inhabitants will need to look for our inspiration elsewhere."], "id": "bc24aeb52ab912e0eb56cd7cac3e109cdfce020704bdf724b56e4be126e09b30", "highlighted_text": " Deleuze writes a philosophy of (virtual) difference without (actual) others Such a philosophy precludes a relational conception of politics Rather than align with the  nomadic war machine , our first task should be to develop ways of responding to the techniques which police the margins of empire the agents of imperialism have more to learn from Deleuzian  rhizomatics than their opponents the notion that a subject\u2019s decisions might have genuine consequences is foreign to Deleuze\u2019s thought He abandons the decisive subject in favour of our immediate subjection to the imperatives of creative life Deprived of any strategic apparatus, Deleuze\u2019s philosophy combines the self-grounding sufficiency of pure force with our in-action an individual only provides a vessel for the power that works through it those of us who still seek to change our world will need to look for inspiration elsewhere", "highlights": [[4, 0, 75], [4, 212, 229], [4, 230, 239], [4, 240, 241], [4, 256, 289], [4, 546, 563], [4, 574, 582], [4, 582, 582], [4, 583, 602], [4, 602, 603], [4, 604, 639], [4, 652, 677], [4, 695, 705], [4, 746, 751], [4, 761, 771], [4, 782, 799], [4, 894, 943], [4, 944, 953], [4, 953, 953], [4, 954, 965], [4, 966, 970], [4, 974, 989], [4, 1613, 1640], [4, 1645, 1665], [4, 1666, 1686], [4, 1731, 1733], [4, 1745, 1765], [4, 1780, 1787], [4, 2036, 2038], [4, 2039, 2068], [4, 2069, 2071], [4, 2072, 2078], [4, 2079, 2085], [4, 2091, 2111], [4, 2112, 2147], [4, 2160, 2217], [4, 2223, 2276], [4, 2300, 2308], [4, 2357, 2366], [4, 3312, 3341], [4, 3342, 3384], [4, 4776, 4822], [4, 4854, 4875], [4, 4880, 4901]], "underlines": [[2, 19, 28], [2, 34, 55], [2, 81, 96], [4, 0, 75], [4, 212, 229], [4, 230, 239], [4, 240, 241], [4, 256, 289], [4, 546, 563], [4, 574, 582], [4, 583, 602], [4, 604, 639], [4, 652, 677], [4, 695, 705], [4, 746, 751], [4, 761, 771], [4, 782, 799], [4, 894, 943], [4, 944, 953], [4, 953, 953], [4, 954, 965], [4, 966, 970], [4, 974, 989], [4, 1613, 1640], [4, 1645, 1665], [4, 1666, 1686], [4, 1731, 1733], [4, 1745, 1765], [4, 1765, 1765], [4, 1780, 1787], [4, 2036, 2038], [4, 2039, 2068], [4, 2069, 2071], [4, 2072, 2078], [4, 2079, 2085], [4, 2091, 2111], [4, 2112, 2147], [4, 2160, 2217], [4, 2223, 2276], [4, 2300, 2308], [4, 2357, 2366], [4, 3312, 3341], [4, 3342, 3384], [4, 4776, 4822], [4, 4854, 4875], [4, 4880, 4901]], "emphasis": [[4, 230, 239], [4, 256, 289], [4, 894, 943], [4, 944, 953], [4, 953, 953], [4, 954, 965], [4, 966, 970], [4, 974, 989], [4, 1666, 1686], [4, 2039, 2068], [4, 2091, 2111], [4, 2357, 2366], [4, 3342, 3384]], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "neg-5.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local"}, {"tag": "[2] The alternative fails \u2013 there\u2019s nothing radical about rhizomatic politics or their account of difference \u2013 they produce a totalizing theory that destroys political struggle", "cite": "Dean 05 \u2013 Department of Political Science, Hobart and William Smith Colleges", "body": ["(Jodi, \u201cZizek against Democracy,\u201d Law, Culture and the Humanities 2005(1):154-177, accessed 5-9-16 //Bozzles the Bozz-Dawg Bozz Bozz)", "Zizek\u2019s three arguments against multiculturalism / its failure to call into question the capitalist economy, its speculative identity with irrational violence, and its preclusion of politicization / can be read in terms of divergences from Connolly, Hardt and Negri, and Deleuze and Guattari. So, not only does Connolly\u2019s emphasis on the pluralization of modes of becoming and Hardt\u2019s and Negri\u2019s account of a multitude of singularities seek to open the political terrain beyond an orthodox focus on class antagonism, say, but Deleuze\u2019s and Guattari\u2019s concepts of becoming machine, the communication of affective intensities, and the rhizomatic structures of being and thinking are effectively the ideology of the \u2018\u2018netocracy\u2019\u2019 or digital elite. 47 For Zizek, the fundamental homology between these concepts and networked technoculture decreases their radicality. Furthermore, Zizek\u2019s emphasis on the speculative identity of toleration and irrational violence contrasts with efforts in behalf of an ethos of generosity or critical responsiveness in Connolly\u2019s work. For Zizek, insofar as such an ethos aims to combat and eliminate dogmatic certainty, it rests on precisely that fundament of irrational, contingent attachment it seeks to erase. 48 And, finally, Zizek\u2019s rejection of a multitude of singularities should be read as an alternative to Hardt and Negri. For Zizek, singular positions are not political. They become political through articulation with other struggles and, in this way, are inseparable from the division of the social. Echoing Badiou, moreover, Zizek argues that emphasis on multitude and diversity masks \u2018\u2018the underlying monotony of today\u2019s global life.\u2019\u2019 He writes, \u2018\u2018is there anything more monotonous than the Deleuzian poetry of contemporary life as the decentred proliferation of multitudes, of nontotalizable differences? What occludes (and thereby sustains) this monotony is the multiplicity of resignifications and displacements to which the basic ideological texture is submitted.\u2019\u2019 50 The more things change, the more they remain the same. Or, lots of little micro-struggles don\u2019t automatically produce macro-level change. Accordingly, one could say that even though Zizek is an avowed theorist of totality, Deleuze is the totalizing theorist, the theorist whose all-inclusive account of the social cannot account for the division necessary for political struggle. 51 Deleuze, and with him Connolly and Hardt and Negri, embraces an ethics of affirmation that eliminates negativity from the political.

While Deleuze and Guattari do not construct the sort of metaphysical binaries that we have seen in Baudrillard's later work, their metaphorical mapping of space can be read within the context of Euro-American discourses of modernism, emphasizing the benefits of distance and the valorization of displacement. Indeed, I would argue that their privileging of \"nomadic\" modes relies upon an opposition berween a central site of subjectivity and zones of marginality. Thus their advocacy of a process of \"becoming minor\" depends upon the erasure of the site of their own subject positions. What links these European poststructuralist theorists of displacement, then, is the specificity of their modernist critical traditions along with an inability to account for the transnational power relations that construct postrnodern subjectivities. This said, Deleuze and Guattari's theories of territory mark significant departures in poststructuralist paradigms. The relative popularity of many of Deleuze and Guattari's concepts and terms in Euro-American literary criticism and philosophical studies prompts a rigorous reading of their collaborative texts. Associated with radical reworkings of philosophy, critiques of psychoanalytic practices, support for the Italian alltonoltlia political movements and the French avant-garde, Deleuze and Guattari have produced (separately and together) many of the most provocative and overtly political texts of contemporary French poststructuralism. Utopian articulations of the future share textual space with incisive critiques of the structure and operation of Euro-American modernity. It is precisely Deleuze and Guattari's emphasis on breaking out of or rupturing dominant social practices that both inspires and irks critics, leading to praise for their utopian vision as well as critiques of their tendency to romanticize the subjects of criticism.\" Deleuze and Guattari's texts vitally engage the context of EuroAmerican modernist experimentations in language and textual innovation even as they can be seen to be in tension with that very tradition. Indeed, their politically committed theorization of power relations challenges the dominant structures and practices of modernity. In their effort to imagine differently the social spaces and sites of subjectivity, Deleuze and Guattari theorize alternative kinds of identities and modes of dwelling that counter the fixed comrnodifications of capitalist relations. Unanchored to any specific historical formation, the radical displacement that is continually evoked in these texts is most often referred to as \"deterritorialization.\" First theorized in Anti-Oediplls to describe the dislodging and dispersal of desire in modern capitalist formations, the notion of deterritorialization appears throughout the collective texts, including A Thousand Platealls and Kafka: Toward a Minor Literatllre. Linked to deterritorialization (and its corollary, reterritorialization), the production of \"nomad\" or \"nomadic\" theory signifies the importance of modes of displacement in Deleuze and Guattari's work. Deleuze and Guattari appropriate a number of metaphors to produce sites of displacement in their theory. The botanical metaphor of the rootlike \"rhizome,\" for example, enacts the subjectivities of deterrirorialization: burrowing through substance, fragmenting into simultaneous sprouts, moving with a certain stealth, powerful in its dispersion. Rejecting the classic, Western humanist metaphors of family trees and genealogies, the rhizome destabilizes the conventions of origins and endings: \"A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, berween things, interbeing, inlermf!il{o. The tree is filiation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance.\"\" As a metaphor for politics, then, the rhizome constitutes an anarchic relationship to space and subjectivity, resistant to and undermining the nation-state apparatus. From the rhizome to the nomad is not a far leap in the poetics of Euro-American poststructuralist theory. Like the rhizome, the nomadic subject symbolizes displacement and dispersion. In Deleuze and Guattari's work, the site of the desert, traditional home of the nomad, is not unlike Baudrillard's sublime, sidireal space: empry, liberatory, and a margin for linguistic, cultural, and political experimentation. For example, in their study of Kafka's poetics of alterity, Deleuze and Guattari make repeated reference to the desert as border or margin, linked to \"underdevelopment,\" ''palois:' and a \"third world.\"\" Similarly, the nomad is likened to the \"immigrant\" and the \"gypsy.\"'! In all of these allusions, modernity and posrrnodernity collapse into undifferentiated cultures; Euro-American (or even solely European) culture structures the point of view, erasing temporal and spatial differentiations. European gypsies and Third World immigrants share the same theoretical spaces not through structural relations of historically specific diasporas but through a kind of generalized poetics of displacement. In making recourse to the metaphors of marginality and displacement, Deleuze and Guattari attempt to displace the sedimented bulk of European humanist traditions. Their antihistoricism seeks to deconstruct classical lineages even as it may tend to homogenize or blur the kinds of differences upon which contemporary identity politics insist. Yet the utility of their methodology (which appears to be much more useful to Europeans and some North Americans-that is, to those who occupy the sites of domination in modernity) is always generalized. The Third World functions simply as a metaphorical margin for European oppositional strategies, an imaginary space, rather than a location of theoretical production itself. This kind of \"othering\" in theory repeats the anthropological gesture of erasing the subject position of the theorist and perpetuates a kind of colonial discourse in the name of progressive politics. In their emphasis upon linguistic \"escape\" and \"lines of flight,\" Deleuze and Guattari roam into realms of nostalgia, searching for a way to detour Western civilization. Their theory of \"becoming minor\" evokes this Euro-American modernist move of utopian Right from the worst excesses of capitalism. \"Becoming minor\" is a strategy that only makes sense to the central, major, or powerful, yet it is presented as an imperative for \"us all.\" Constructing binaries between major and minor, between developed and undeveloped, or center and periphery, in Deleuze and Guattari's collaborative texts modernity provides borders and zones of alterity to tempt the subversive bourgeois/ intellectual. Becoming minor, a utopian process of letting go of privileged identities and practices, requires emulating the ways and modes of modernity's \"others.\" Yet, like all imperialist discourses, these spaces and identities are produced through their imagining; that is, the production of sites of escape or decolonization for the colonizer signals a kind of theoretical tourism. For these spaces of alterity are not the symbols of productive estrangement or disengagement for any other subjects. These imagined spaces are invested with subversive or destabilizing power by the \"visitors,\" as it were. This theoretical activity doubles the metaphorical colonization of moderniry's margins and marginals - here colonial space must symbolize the imperialist past as a zone of utter alterity as well as the site of the liberation of the Euro-American subject. \"Becoming minor\" refers to the center-periphery geopolitics of modernity rather than the complex, transnational circuits of capital and power in postrnodernity. Thus when Deleuze and Guattari pose a \"nomadology\" against \"history\" they evince nostalgia for a space and a subject outside Western modernity, apart from all chronology and totalization. Their celebration of deterritorialization links the Euro-American modernist valuation of exile, expatriation, defarniliarization, and displacement and the colonial discourses of culrural differences to a philosophy that appears to critique the foundations of that very tradition. Deleuze and Guattari can be read as \"high modernists,\" then, privileging language experimentation over all other strategies. Their model of deterritorialization, like most Euro-American modernist versions of exilic displacement, stresses the freedom of disconnection and the pleasures of interstitial subjectivity. Yet deterritorialization itself cannot escape colonial discourse. The movement of deterritorialization colonizes, appropriates, even raids other spaces: \"Write, form a rhizome, increase your territory by deterritorialization, extend the line of flight to the point where it becomes an abstract machine covering the entire plane of consistency.\"\" Deterritorialization is always reterritorialization, an increase of territory, an imperialization. The nomad serves as the site of this romanticized imaginary entry into the \"becoming minor\" of deterritorialization. In going \"from one point to another\" in the process of distributing \"people (or animals) in an open space,\" nomads have \"absolute movement,\" as distinct from migrants, who move in more determined and located ways. Paradoxically, the nomad can be seen to be the one who \"does not move\" in that the nomad's movements cannot be tracked or linked to a starting or end point. Like the metaphor of rhizome, nomadism signifies the inverse of dwelling or being and celebrates the intemezzo zone. As a symbol of utter and complete deterritorialization, the nomad does not engage in the reterritorialization that Deleuze and Guattari describe as a necessary component of language (the rerum of sense after the experimentation of \"becoming minor\"). The nomad in Deleuze and Guattari's texts embodies the practice of shifting location, vectors of deterritorialization, a \"local absolute\": \"an absolute that is manifested locally, and engendered in a series of local operations of varying orientations: desert, steppe, ice, sea.\"\"  "], "id": "6f1d2daac55e71be8c7f435ae61b4bebe236f717fdf0c3c69a89ee60047a7904", "highlighted_text": " While poststructuralism potentially deconstructs the power relations inherent in Euro-American humanism, the metaphors of explanation reinforce modernist versions of colonial discourse Deleuze and Guattari metaphorical mapping emphasizing the benefits displacement relies upon an opposition berween a central site of subjectivity and zones of marginality The Third World functions simply as a metaphorical margin an imaginary space, rather than a location of theoretical production itself This kind of \"othering\" in theory repeats the anthropological gesture of erasing the subject position of the theorist  and perpetuates a kind of colonial discourse in the name of progressive politics linguistic \"escape\" and \"lines of flight roam into realms of nostalgia Becoming minor only makes sense to the central, major, or powerful, yet it is presented as an imperative for \"us all like all imperialist discourses , these spaces and identities are produced through their imagining a kind of theoretical tourism deterritorialization cannot escape colonial discourse .

Pgs. 11-14)//NotJacob", "body": ["The student movements of the sixties and seventies represent both a portion and a disruption of this genealogy. They point to an academic moment that helped to rearticulate the nature of state and capital, a moment in which truth as the ideal of the university and the mediator of state and civil society was joined by difference in general, and minoritized difference in particular. Moreover, the academy became the \u201ctraining ground\u201d for state and capital\u2019s engagement with minority difference as a site of representation and meaning. A historical and theoretical reconsideration of the interdisciplinary fields means displacing the economic and its thesis that the academy is a mere reflection or derivation of political economy. In terms of this narrative of rejection and derivation, we are the inheritors of a philosopher\u2019s deception, the children of a ruse. The extent to which we accept the academy and things academic as the designs of the economic is the measure of our dependence on this trick secured through a rhetoric of impotence and remove. The modern Western academy was created as the repository and guarantor of national culture as well as a cultivator and innovator of political economy. As such, the academy is an archive of sorts, whose technologies\u2014 or so the theory goes\u2014 are constantly refined to acquire the latest innovation. As an archiving institution, the academy is\u2014 to use Derrida\u2019s description of the archive\u2014\u201c institutive and conservative. Revolutionary and traditional. An economic archive in this double sense: it keeps, it puts in reserve, it saves, but in an unnatural fashion, that is to say in making the law (nomos) or in making people respect the law.\u201d 25 The academy has always been an economic domain; that is, it has simultaneously determined who gets admitted while establishing the rules for membership and participation. In the context of the post\u2013 World War II United States, the American academy can be read as a record of the shifts and contradictions of political economy. Indeed, with the admission of women and people of color into predominantly white academic settings, the economic character of the American academy did not simply vanish. The academy would begin to put, keep in reserve, and save minoritized subjects and knowledges in an archival fashion, that is, by devising ways to make those subjects and knowledges respect power and its \u201claws.\u201d Put differently, the ethnic and women\u2019s studies movements applied pressures on the archival conventions of the academy in an effort to stretch those conventions so that previously excluded subjects might enjoy membership. But it also meant that those subjects would fall under new and revised laws. As a distinct archival economy, the American academy would help inform the archival agendas of state and capital\u2014 how best to institute new peoples, new knowledges, and cultures and at the same time discipline and exclude those subjects according to a new order. This was the moment in which power would hone its own archival economy, producing formulas for the incorporation rather than the absolute repudiation of difference, all the while refining and perfecting its practices of exclusion and regulation. This is the time when power would restyle its archival propensities by dreaming up ways to affirm difference and keep it in hand. Ethnic studies and women\u2019s studies movements were the prototypical resources of incorporative and archival systems of power that re invented themselves because of civil rights and liberation movements of the fifties, sixties, and seventies. Part of the signature achievements of these affirmative modes of power was to make the pursuit of recognition and legitimacy into formidable horizons of pleasure, insinuating themselves into radical politics, trying to convince insurgents that \u201cyour dreams are also mine.\u201d By excavating the social movements, we may be able to chart the emergence of this new kind of archival economy that transformed academic, political, economic, and social life from the late sixties and beyond. More over, focusing on the social movements and the denominations of interdisciplinary forms that emerged from them might allow us to produce a counterarchive detailing the ways in which power worked through the \u201crecognition\u201d of minoritized histories, cultures, and experiences and how power used that \u201crecognition\u201d to resecure its status. The histories of interdisciplinary engagements with forms of difference represent a conflicted and contradictory negotiation with this horizon of power. Seen this way, we must entrust the interdisciplines with a new charge, that of assessing power\u2019s archival techniques and maneuvers. As Self-Portrait 2000 suggests, the involution of marginal differences and the development of the interdisciplines, broadly conceived, denoted the elaboration of power rather than the confirmation that our \u201cliberty\u201d had been secured. We must make it our business to critically deploy those modes of difference that have become part of power\u2019s trick and devise ways to use them otherwise. The influence that the student movements had on institutional life within the United States points to a need to assess the streams of the academy within political economy. If state and particularly capital needed the academy to reorient their sensibilities toward the affirmation of difference\u2014 that is, to complete the constitutional project of the United States and begin to resolve the contradictions of social exclusion\u2014 then it also meant that the academy became the laboratory for the revalorization of modes of difference. This changing set of representations, the institutions that organized themselves around that set, and the modes of power that were compelled by and productive of those transformations are what we are calling the interdisciplines.

Looked at from this perspective, my 2003 paper played a role in the discursive enclosure of \u2018expert practices\u2019 (Melrose 2007) in the institution\u2019s unfolding encyclopaedia of knowledge and power. Practical action and doing performance work, which once belonged to the sphere of praxis, have become part of the realm of knowledge and belong to the university as intellectual property. Practices that were felt to be \u2018just intuitive\u2019 (Melrose 2005) have been named properly, as \u2018expert-performancepractitioner-centred modes of knowledge and models of intelligibility\u2019 (Melrose 2007), embodied thinking or somatic knowing. With performance becoming valued as a subject, and with the legitimation of practice-as-research, comes the ability to regulate its unruly ways and imprecise languages \u2013 to bring those who make this object of study within the university, its disciplines and governance. In the 1980s and early 1990s it might have been possible to work in the academy and borrow its resources to create professional practice outside. But, since the admission of practical research outcomes in HEFCE\u2019s 1996 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and the embedding of practice-as-research in UK research culture, the field of performance has been territorialized and work presented professionally counts as university product. There are few socio-cultural spaces beyond the scope of the REF and its new impact agenda, and in order to be a practitioner in the university you must demonstrate the excellence of work produced outside, plus evidence of external recognition. While the intellectual \u2018worthiness\u2019 (Melrose 2002) of practice-as-research and the counting of impact has strengthened the position of practitioners in universities and their potential for progression or promotion, this inclusion has undoubtedly influenced their creative activities. The debt that the performancemaker \u2018owes to the academy\u2019 for their entry is to \u2018incorporate[, in their work,] a scholarly apparatus that enables [their peers] to assess [its] value and significance \u2026 as the results of \u2026 research\u2019 (Cooper 2005, np). The \u2018obligation\u2019 is to make art with a research imperative and to produce excellence within the frame of the REF, which values practice if \u2018enhancements\u2019 are produced \u2018in knowledge and understanding in the discipline\u2019 (ibid.). This transforms the aims and aspirations of university practitioners, their ways of practising performance and the form of artwork produced, the quality of which is assessed according to criteria for research and impact rather than aesthetic judgements. In spite of the above, in the hierarchy of knowledge, monographs and peer-reviewed articles, like this one, still rule. Performance can only pass as research when accompanied by framing discursive documents \u2013 300 word statements and questions, which are admittedly often written retrospectively, after the practical research has concluded and its outcomes are known. As Conquergood (2002) wrote thirteen years ago in his article \u2018Performance studies: Interventions and radical research\u2019, \u2018knowing how\u2019 (146) remains a \u2018subjugated knowledge\u2019 (Foucault 1980:81), struggling for its place. As he said then, \u2018promotion committees dominated by the more institutionally powerful scholars [\u2026 still] do not know how to appraise a record of artistic accomplishment commensurate with traditional criteria of scholarly research and publication\u2019 (Conquergood 2002:153). Despite doing the necessary labour of teaching performance practice and producing impact, as a practitioner-researcher my position continues to feel weak and at risk, like an uninvited guest or imposter in the academy. In addition there is an ongoing fight to maintain the hours allocated for workshops, to justify the low staffstudent ratios necessary and the inefficiency of practice-based teaching, which fails to produce more student satisfaction in the National Student Survey (NSS) for less contact hours. Having internalized the precarity that even those of us on permanent contracts feel, I place an obligation on myself to fulfil all aspects of my role professionally and responsibly, perform self-assurance, compete effectively with other researchers (especially in UOA 35, Music, Drama, Dance and Performing Arts) and continue my professional development. I acknowledge the way that my subjectivity has been fabricated by the university and shaped by our precarious positions in it. Hence I cannot resist the desire to do well in the next REF, feeling driven to attempt to produce research excellence and be impactful. My subjectivity is one of the outputs of the institutional apparatus and I reproduce the university, HEFCE and Arts Council England\u2019s values and ways of thinking as my own aspirations, putting myself into my work and wanting it to \u2018influenc[e] civil society and quality of life\u2019, to believe in this vision and the need to capture such contributions. For all this writing of subversion I may not have the autonomous agency or self-determination to resist, or be \u2018disobedient\u2019 in Virno\u2019s terms (Virno 2004; see also Lazzarato 2010). As well as the good citizenship discussed above, the format of Bristol\u2019s academic CV has a category for \u2018Entrepreneurship\u2019, a further academic responsibility to determine routes to market for research outputs and develop their competitiveness. Each institution\u2019s environment statement for REF 2014 and impact case studies also accounted for academic enterprise, contribution \u2018to economic prosperity\u2019 (REF 2012) and scholars\u2019 relationships with cultural and creative industries.6 I am an artistic director of Uninvited Guests and this company limited by guarantee was listed on the Environment Template along with its income. Here the professional world, \u2018the industries of creativity\u2019 6 The REF 2014 Environment Template provides an account of the university department, or unit of assessment\u2019s research strategy, people and staff development, income, statistical data, infrastructure and facilities, collaboration with other institutions or industries and contribution to the discipline or research base (see REF 2012). (Raunig 2013) and culture exterior to the university are encircled or brought inside its expanded walls. Uninvited Guests, its producers and those employed by it, become university workers by proxy, as they transfer practiceframed-as-research to wider audiences, whose number and diversity are measured. We may ask whether Uninvited Guests therefore reproduces the university and performs its social work in the private-public spheres beyond, whether its performers are unwitting agents or representatives of the university, marketing and distributing its knowledge, know-how and vision. The Department of Drama\u2019s Environment Template measured the quality of Uninvited Guests\u2019 performances by financial income, transformed audiences and reception into figures and capital, and quantified dissemination. It is worth noting that there is a double counting of Uninvited Guests\u2019 output of impact and that Arts Council England (ACE), who fund the work, also use the neoliberal language of instrumentalization, social change and transformation. The company has received project funding from Grants for the arts and ACE for a number of research and development (R&D), production processes and national tours. The Arts Council\u2019s website \u2018talk[s] about the value of arts and culture to society\u2019, how \u2013 in addition to art\u2019s \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 \u2013 they \u2018cherish\u2019 the ways it \u2018can illuminate our inner lives and enrich our emotional world\u2019, along with producing \u2018more measurable impact on our economy, health and wellbeing, society and culture\u2019 (2014). ACE encourages the professionalization of artists as entrepreneurs, uses the terminology of the transformation economy (see Pine and Gilmore 2001), and makes demands on publicly funded cultural labourers similar to those asked of academic researchers \u2013 that is, to account for and evidence how their work is applied as an instrument of personal and social change, its extrinsic use-value: excellence in impact translates into investment as much as intrinsic aesthetic quality, and the latter may only accrue cultural capital. It could also be argued that, as well as art experiences, the Arts Council and state\u2019s ethos, ideology and policies are disseminated or reproduced through touring to new neighbourhoods and diversifying audiences. With Arts Council England and funded venues operating within the same neoliberal conditions and policies as the university, being required to evidence their efficiency and efficacy, they subject arts producers to related impact agendas and evaluative metrics \u2013 apparatuses for accounting for interactions and engagement. While \u2018defection\u2019 from the university to the professional or public context is an option, it does not \u2018modify the conditions within which the struggle takes place\u2019, constitute an \u2018exit\u2019 or afford further autonomy, as the professional practitioner remains in service to the production of impact, in order to justify investment, and also to art market forces (Virno 2004:70). Closely related dispositifs \u2013 management instruments, financialized languages and evaluative frameworks \u2013 determine artists' drive to innovate and the association of practices with capital, both within and beyond the university. The business or profession of performance- making was once resistant to the production of commodities or exchangeable objects. Rather than producing material or durable goods, the outputs of this cooperative labour were cultural products that became themselves through disappearance. For Marx (1990 [1976]), in the case of teaching and performing, the product was inseparable from the act of producing and the producer; they were activities-without-end- product, like personal services. Performance, as Virno (2004) writes, \u2018is an activity which finds its own \u2026 purpose \u2026 in itself, without objectifying itself into \u2026 a \u201cfinished product,\u201d or into an object which would survive the performance\u2019 (52). For him, theatre or performance \u2018requires the presence of others\u2019 (52) and interactions, and is hence closely aligned to praxis, the vita activa and political action. As I have noted, work has appropriated the activities of praxis, the political and social interactions that took place in the territory of politics and leisure, turning these to the public good of the private company \u2013 or in this case the university \u2013 and its ethos. Our economic model has shifted from \u2018general intellect\u2019 (Marx 1993 [1972]: 706), in which the common mode of labour is cognitive, to \u2018general performance\u2019 (L\u00fctticken 2012), in which the majority of workers across diverse fields and forms are expected to perform themselves publicly, improve their performance and produce immaterial goods, such as relationships with customers and colleagues, positive feelings and affects. As Hardt and Negri (2004) write, contemporary labour \u2018from sales work to financial services, is fundamentally a performance: the product is the act itself\u2019 (200). In our post-Fordist times, cultural industry, and specifically performance, has become the \u2018industry of the means of production\u2019 (Virno 2004: 61). \u2018Performance has been put to work\u2019 (Hardt and Negri 2004: 200) and it is \u2018the special capabilities of [the] performing artist\u2019 (Virno 2004: 52), their virtuosities, which are the contemporary tools, techniques and procedures of the means of production. If workers are generally expected to perform their labour, then performance abilities appreciate as embodied assets in people as \u2018enterprises\u2019 (Lazzarato 2012: 56). How does studying performance through practice resist the production of human capital and producing graduates as virtuosic \u2018entrepreneurs of themselves\u2019 (Foucault 2008: 226)? The language of theatre and performance is prevalent in business schools and management studies, with Pine and Gilmore (2001) writing of companies staging unique events \u2013 shopping and dining experiences \u2013 in which the work \u2018perishes upon its performance\u2019 but \u2018the value of the experience lingers in the memories of individuals engaged by the event\u2019 (80). This chimes with performance studies\u2019 thinking around the way that performance both disappears and remains (see Phelan 1993 and Schneider 2011). What does this context of an economy of experience, affects and transformation mean for the politics or ethics of teaching practical performance \u2013 producing students well-trained in the means of production, for experiential approaches to research and for the radical potential of companies like Uninvited Guests, which stage experiences or market unique, participatory performance events? In conclusion I will return to Conquergood, whose 2002 article, subtitled \u2018Interventions and radical research\u2019, was a foundational text for the inclusion of practice and applied performance research in the academy. In it he proposed \u2018braiding together disparate and stratified ways of knowing\u2019 (152), crisscrossing between \u2018activity and analysis, \u2026 thinking and doing, interpreting and making (153), in order to challenge the academy\u2019s \u2018deeply entrenched division of labor\u2019, hierarchy of value and organization of knowledge. What I would ask now is whether his mission to triangulate \u2018practical knowledge, \u2026 propositional knowledge and politic[al]\u2019 action remains resistant, if these spheres are already hybridized as scholarly work and part of the university\u2019s terrain. It is precisely these hybrid modes that the academic institution currently seeks to develop and capitalize upon, through enterprise and networking with creative industries, and through engaging with diverse publics in order to generate measurable impact. Conquergood writes optimistically of research projects that reach outside the academy, of performance studies\u2019 workers engaging with \u2018activism, outreach\u2019 (152), making meaningful connections and social commitments to communities \u2013 of political praxis. In the context of the contemporary university we need to consider the territorializing as well as radical possibilities of such articulations. How can creative practice fulfil its transgressive promise when it is institutionalized, transformed into the university\u2019s impact, enterprise and product mix? If these activities are in the university and part of the work that a professional academic is contracted for, they can be acquired, commodified, managed and marketed by the university. The academy has embraced different ways of knowing, but to what end and are these modes of knowledge any less subjugated? Under these late capitalist conditions, can performance practice still generate fugitivity escape capture as knowledge or unsettle the \u2018encyclopedic circle of the [state] university\u2019 (Harney and Moten 2013: 34)? As Isabell Lorey (2010) proposes, can socio-political affects, impacts and exchanges with others retain a \u2018capacity for refusal\u2019, resisting being entirely measured or \u2018economicized\u2019 (5)? Are there \u2018surpluses\u2019 that cannot be capitalized on, \u2018absorbed\u2019 or \u2018wholly determined\u2019 by the institution, which produce \u2018potentialities of resistance\u2019? Can subversive intellectuals save some autonomous time for inconvenient academic freedom, inefficient and unprofessional activities, including study in Harney and Moten\u2019s terms, without \u2018knowledge production\u2019 (12), output, credit or end? Can the \u2018refugee colony\u2019 of practitioner researchers, of which I am one, retain the subversive potential \u2018to be in but not of the university\u2019 (26), to steal into the academy and poach its resources, to intervene, as Conquergood claimed? Or do we borrow from the university solely for the university\u2019s benefit? As a virtue of being incorporated in the neoliberal institution, are our subjectivities produced and shaped, such that, whether we are practising inside or outside, we are of the university, embodying ways of thinking, desires and aspirations that mimic institutional drives, values and vision? Or, in Lazzarato\u2019s terms, can immaterial and cognitive wage-labourers access non- exploitative temporalities, in which antagonistic subjectivities may form themselves or be created, politically, intellectually and imaginatively independent of the interests of university and state productivity: can our practices be dissociated from capital and returned to common sense or collective knowledge, as public goods?

In 2012, Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney discovered that Google searches for individuals with Black-sounding names were more likely to generate advertisements for arrest records than searches for individuals with white-sounding names\u2014even if no arrest records actually existed. This flawed system could result in significant emotional, reputational, or financial harm for racially-stereotyped individuals, as well as amplify the profiling associated with algorithmic biases. The lack of competition in the online search industry not only eliminates consumers\u2019 options to choose a different, less-biased search engine, but also reduces market incentives for Google to improve its biased algorithms, as was recently illustrated by the dismissal of the former technical co-lead of Google\u2019s Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team, Timnit Gebru. Large technology companies also routinely collect massive volumes of data about people, compounded in scale through mergers and acquisitions. Using this data, they can surveil selected populations for online behavioral advertising or micro-interactions based on known or inferred attributes. In this sense, advertisers choose which communities can see or do not see their ads\u2014either through the direct targeting of demographic variables like age, gender, sexual orientation, or race, or through \u201cproxy variables\u201d like zip code, education, interests, and purchase history. These activities can disproportionately impact marginalized communities who may be shown different employment, credit cards, housing, and other advertisements based on the platform or advertising algorithm.

But the most significant influence \u2014at least during the early development of the GND\u2014was a body of economic theory that we called the \u201cnew consensus.\u201d Exemplified by the work of economists like Ha- Joon Chang, Mariana Mazzucato, Kate Raworth, Ann Pettifor, and Joseph Stiglitz, the new consensus rejects neoliberalism as the \u201cright\u201d governing paradigm for modern states. Instead, it contends that many of the crises that we face are the result not of government overreach but of government\u2019s abdicating its economic responsibilities: as a market creator, as an industrial planner, and as an innovator. Neoclassical economists believe governments should only seek to correct market failures, but as Mazzucato writes in The Entrepreneurial State, \u201cthat view forgets that markets are blind\u2026 They may neglect societal or environmental concerns\u2026 they often head in suboptimal, path-dependent directions that are self-reinforcing.\u201d When oil companies relentlessly pursue extraction in deeper and more dangerous parts of the earth while ignoring clean energy investment, this is \u201cnot just about market failure,\u201d Mazzucato argues, but \u201cit\u2019s about the wrong kind of market getting stuck\u201d; we need government \u201cactively creating and shaping (new) markets, while regulating existing ones.\u201d", "Following Keynesian theory, Green New Dealers are guided by the principle that government can and must do things that no other institutions do\u2014be they the market, the church, or the family. It\u2019s the reason why strengthening the public sector and empowering the government are crucial to the policy vision of the GND, because we need a direct, efficient, and just economic transformation, which the market alone cannot\u2014and will not\u2014provide.", "Governments have an essential, constitutive role to play in steering national economies, and the GND seeks to embrace this role by rebalancing the relationship between the public (the state) and the private (the market). This does not mean that businesses and financial markets should not or cannot have a role to play. New Consensus economists see the private sector as essential to economic transformation and prosperity. In the GND\u2019s policy vision, the government is not a handmaiden of the market, relegated to only fixing market failures; it\u2019s a leader and a risk-taker that uses its unique abilities to create, regulate, and shape markets.", "With government playing a leading role in the economy, the arsenal of public powers available to policymakers is expanded, allowing us to comprehensively and equitably solve climate, social, and economic crises. Three additional principles from New Consensus economists should guide Green New Dealers as we craft policy.", "First, the US government, at all levels, must have a coordinated vision and strategy for a new \u201cgreen\u201d economy. As Mazzucato argues, one of the reasons the US has failed to significantly reduce emissions and develop a competitive clean technology sector is that the federal government has adopted a \u201cpatchwork\u201d approach to climate policy, uncoordinated across state agencies and jurisdictions. Second, public spending and investment are essential, not just for infrastructure and \u201cpublic goods\u201d but for innovation. Federal investment in R&D funded some of our most important technologies, including GPS, nanotechnology, and many key components of smartphones. Although we have most of the technology we need for decarbonization, we still need additional breakthroughs to fully transition from fossil fuels. However, as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), public spending for R&D has declined nearly 50 percent since the 1980s. GND policies must set aside neoliberal dogmas about the need to keep public spending low and instead embrace large-scale public investment strategies that rapidly decarbonize our economy and reposition the US as a leader, instead of a laggard, in the global green economy. Third, the Green New Deal should invest in the real economy, not financialization. Although engagement with financial markets and products is important to the success of the GND, its policies should invest, first and foremost, in the \u201creal economy,\u201d meaning the parts of the economy made up of the flow of goods and services. GND policies should focus on factors that translate to real economic outcomes for everyday people (for example, job creation, wage levels, rates of unionization, and so forth) before focusing on what makes sense for financial markets and monetary policy. Monetary policy still matters, but financial markets should not be a primary concern when designing and implementing policy for the Green New Deal.", "Our values informed how we interpreted the theories of New Consensus thinkers. We designed the Green New Deal as an economic mobilization not simply because it was the best solution to meet the need to rapidly decarbonize but because it was the solution that also provided the greatest opportunity for compassion, dignity, and justice. From the New Deal to World War II, economic mobilizations built the American middle class; but, as we discussed before, they only served certain Americans. With the Green New Deal, we have a chance to decarbonize, rebuild our economy, and correct those failures, but only if we design policies that do not treat injustice as a necessary\u2014or acceptable\u2014 consequence of capitalism."], "id": "57922a357a943f215a923a565b1a0a08e816b40d321cf198aafc65568cfcd80c", "highlighted_text": " Several theories influenced the Green New Deal , When oil companies relentlessly pursue extraction this is \u201cnot just market failure, \u201d we need government \u201cactively creating new) markets, while regulating existing ones government must do things no other institutions do Governments have an essential , constitutive role to play in steering national economies We designed the Green New Deal not simply because it was the best solution but the solution that provided the greatest opportunity for compassion, dignity, and justice With the Green New Deal, we have a chance to decarbonize, rebuild and correct failures", "highlights": [[4, 0, 7], [4, 22, 41], [4, 56, 74], [4, 74, 75], [4, 1121, 1170], [4, 1259, 1276], [4, 1283, 1298], [4, 1298, 1299], [4, 1375, 1412], [4, 1426, 1470], [5, 79, 89], [5, 98, 112], [5, 118, 142], [6, 0, 19], [6, 20, 29], [6, 29, 30], [6, 31, 68], [6, 69, 87], [9, 79, 109], [9, 138, 181], [9, 222, 225], [9, 241, 258], [9, 264, 334], [9, 492, 557], [9, 571, 582], [9, 589, 597]], "underlines": [[4, 0, 7], [4, 8, 21], [4, 22, 41], [4, 42, 55], [4, 56, 74], [4, 86, 142], [4, 177, 193], [4, 473, 565], [4, 587, 795], [4, 893, 902], [4, 903, 909], [4, 964, 971], [4, 1041, 1118], [4, 1121, 1170], [4, 1171, 1258], [4, 1259, 1276], [4, 1277, 1282], [4, 1283, 1298], [4, 1323, 1372], [4, 1375, 1412], [4, 1413, 1426], [4, 1426, 1470], [4, 1470, 1472], [5, 79, 89], [5, 90, 97], [5, 98, 112], [5, 113, 117], [5, 118, 142], [5, 210, 438], [6, 0, 19], [6, 20, 29], [6, 29, 30], [6, 31, 68], [6, 69, 87], [6, 128, 218], [8, 402, 513], [9, 79, 109], [9, 110, 112], [9, 138, 181], [9, 182, 221], [9, 222, 225], [9, 226, 240], [9, 241, 258], [9, 259, 263], [9, 264, 334], [9, 334, 335], [9, 371, 393], [9, 448, 454], [9, 461, 491], [9, 492, 557], [9, 558, 570], [9, 571, 582], [9, 583, 588], [9, 589, 597], [9, 597, 714]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[7, 18], [62, 64]], "filename": "neg-5.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-01"}, {"tag": "Case", "cite": "The 1AC perpetuates colonialism in the name of progressive politics.

This account of decolonization is premised on the view that anticolonial nationalists appropriated the language of self-determination from the liberal internationalist tradition of Woodrow Wilson in order to secure independence from alien rule. In adopting the language of liberal self-determination, the nationalists of the colonized world are thought to have mimicked the existing institutional forms of the nation-state. And while decolonization is credited with universalizing this state system, its nationalist and statist premises are viewed as anachronistic in a postnational and increasingly cosmopolitan world order.", "Recasting anticolonial nationalism as worldmaking disrupts the central assumptions of this standard account. First, it expands the account of empire beyond alien rule by illustrating the ways black anticolonial critics theorized empire as a structure of international racial hierarchy. Drawing on W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s famous diagnosis that the \u201cproblem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\u201d the central characters of this book drew critical attention to the enduring legacy of racial hierarchy and slavery in the making of modern international society. Second, in response to the political dilemmas international racial hierarchy posed, anticolonial nationalists in Africa and the Caribbean insisted that self-determination required a combination of nation-building and worldmaking. Their vision of a postimperial world order prompted nationalists to create international institutions that could secure the conditions of nondomination. This claim that national independence required international institutions was a key insight of the anticolonial account of self-determination. Finally, recovering their global aspirations highlights the persistence of international hierarchy and outlines new directions for contemporary debates about global political and economic justice. Together, the expanded account of empire, the rethinking of anticolonial nationalism, and the theorization of a postcolonial cosmopolitanism constitute elements of a political theory of decolonization.", "Beyond Empire as Alien Rule", "As postcolonial states worked to pass resolution 1514 in 1960, historians, philosophers, and political scientists offered their first interpretations of the unprecedented process of decolonization. That same year, the Oxford philosopher John Plamenatz published On Alien Rule and Self-Government, while, across the Atlantic, the Harvard political scientist Rupert Emerson published From Empire to Nation.3 Emerson and Plamenatz sought to explain how \u201calien rule\u201d suddenly became illegitimate in the twentieth century, and they found their answer in the global diffusion of Western ideals. The delegitimation of alien rule in the mid-twentieth century, Plamenatz argued, was itself a product of the gradual Westernization of the world. European imperial expansion fueled the spread of principles like self-determination, democracy, and freedom and made possible anticolonial nationalists\u2019 critique of alien rule.4 Emerson concurred, arguing that \u201cthrough global conquest the dominant Western powers worked to reshape the world in their own image and thus roused against themselves the forces of nationalism which are both the bitterest enemies of imperialism and, perversely, its finest fruit.\u201d5", "Key tenets of these early interpretations\u2014the emphasis on alien rule, the inattention to the international conditions and context of imperialism, the identification of decolonization with the globalization of the nation-state, and the expansion of international society\u2014continue to shape our understanding of the collapse of territorial empires. From international relations to normative political theory, the recurring emphasis on alien rule conceives of empire as a bilateral relationship between metropole and colony. On this view, empire is a \u201ca system of interaction between two political entities, one of which, the dominant metropole, exerts political control over the internal and external policy\u2014the effective sovereignty\u2014of the other, subordinate periphery.\u201d6 Involuntary subjection, nonreciprocity, and inequality characterize this relationship between the colonized and colonizer. 7 The international component to alien rule is understood as exclusion of the colony from international society.8 Such exclusion differentiates alien rule from other forms of international hegemony that emerge within a rule-bound international order.9 As a result, the international order is conceived as a dual structure that grants metropolitan states membership as sovereign equals and excludes colonies outside of its boundaries. With this bilateral account of imperial domination and a bifurcated view of international society, the alien rule thesis understands self-determination as a double move of overcoming alien rule and achieving inclusion in international society. Empire comes to an end when formerly excluded colonies enter international society as full members, and central to this inclusion is the universalization of the nation-state as the accepted institutional form of self-determination. 10 Twentieth-century decolonization is thus viewed as the culmination of a long history in which the nation-state is progressively globalized and becomes the counterpoint to empire.11", "While the empire-to- nation narrative appears to capture the transformations of the international order in the mid-twentieth century, this account of decolonization also obscures the more far-reaching efforts to remake rather than expand international society. Characterizing decolonization as a process of diffusion, in which a \u201cgradual Westernization\u201d of the world took place, blunts anticolonial nationalism\u2019s radical challenge to the four-century- long project of European imperial expansion. Like British prime minister Harold Macmillan\u2019s evocative phrase \u201cthe wind of change,\u201d the diffusion narrative naturalizes decolonization, rendering it an irresistible development that necessarily follows from empire.12 Indeed, well before the rapid decline of the British Empire, interwar metropolitan intellectuals and elites coined and adopted the term decolonization to reconcile their imperial past and present with what they believed was an inevitable postimperial future.13 In this early articulation, decolonization was pictured as already immanent within the project of empire and did not signal imperial defeat. Decolonization thus \u201cworked to absorb and deflect the phenomenon it ostensibly described.\u201d14", "Rather than a seamless and inevitable transition from empire to nation, anticolonial nationalists refigured decolonization as a radical rupture\u2014one that required a wholesale transformation of the colonized and a reconstitution of the international order. For Kwame Nkrumah, decolonization was not a wind blowing over the African continent but instead a \u201churricane of change . . . [that is] razing to the ground the many bastions of colonialism.\u201d 15 From this perspective, \u201cindependence means much more than merely being free to fly our own flag and to play our own national anthem. It becomes a reality only in a revolutionary framework.\u201d16 Nkrumah\u2019s vision of decolonization as revolution was directed toward undoing the dependencies that colonial domination left behind. Dependence structured the condition of formerly colonized subjects as well as the relationship between the former colony and the international order. According to Nkrumah, a people \u201clong subjected to foreign domination\u201d become habituated to their dependence.17 The nationalist movement and postcolonial state would combat the economic, political, and moral-psychological forms of colonial dependence through an expansive politics of postcolonial citizenship. 18 This nation-building project, however, was insufficient in a context where dependence also characterized the new nation\u2019s condition in the international order. The hoisting of national flags and singing of national anthems\u2014the mere transfer of power\u2014left intact the economic and political position of new states. Decolonization understood as a revolutionary project thus required remaking the international order that sustained relations of dependence and domination. Nation-building was to be situated and realized through worldmaking.", "Nkrumah\u2019s concern with the persistence of domination in the international sphere points to the ways that anticolonial accounts of empire extended beyond alien rule and homed in on the problem of international hierarchy. Anticolonial nationalists argued that a bifurcated system with sovereign and equal members and excluded colonies did not characterize the international order. Instead, colonies and peripheral states were internal to international society but appeared in that space as unequal and subordinated members. For instance, the colonization of Africa in the late nineteenth century was facilitated through international treaties and conferences. In those contexts, African states and political communities were endowed with an international personality that had made possible their domination. Viewed from this perspective, colonization was not experienced as exclusion from but as unequal integration into international society.", "Unequal integration conceives of international society as an internally differentiated space that includes sovereign states, quasisovereigns, and colonies, which are organized through relations of hierarchy. The hierarchical ordering of international society ensured that non-European states were not afforded the full rights of membership in international society. The distribution of rights and obligations was such that non-European states and colonies were encumbered with onerous obligations and had only limited or conditional rights. In highlighting the ways that unequal integration is embedded in the formal institutions of international society, this account of hierarchy departs from theories that emphasize how dominant states exercise economic and military authority over states.19 Distinct from hegemony, unequal integration as a constitutive practice of international law produces differential legal and political standing in international society. This unequal international standing functioned as the enabling background of European imperialism. It coincided with and facilitated political and economic domination.

Too many entities, Ulysse laments, see \u201cHaiti and Haitians [\u2026 as] a manifestation of blackness in its worst form.\u201d Why? Its history and its politics. She continues: \u201cThe unruly enfant terrible of the Americas defied all European odds and created a disorder of things colonial\u201d in the founding of its state.35 This declaration of independence provided a legible and visible challenge to colonialism and to articulations of whiteness (in its many fluctuations and permutations) that represented blackness (variously defined) and statehood as anathema. The message: blackness and sovereignty don\u2019t mix. This is not just a disavowal of Haiti\u2019s origins. As Dubois, Ulysse and others have extolled, Haiti continues to be portrayed as a politically wrong and even abhorrent thing.36", "Although the surge in scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Revolution has shifted some popular perspectives regarding Haiti, much of this work has provided little evidence of Haiti\u2019s relationship to and influence on black statehood and political thought across the last two centuries. Trouillot picks up on this political silence, amongst other occlusions, in Silencing the Past. In one searing passage, Trouillot makes this link plain, charting the ways that the ontological world view held by many whites and non-whites in Europe and the Americas refused to include a vision of freedom for enslaved Africans and their progeny. He argues that it was not that freedom was imagined as impossible for enslaved Africans (and other people of African descent) as much as it was articulated as a state of being that slaves could never achieve. Even those who countered this world view with more radical and equitable articulations about people, politics, freedom and racial difference (and Trouillot acknowledges that there were some) struggled to imagine any world in which a slave uprising could ever lead to the formation of a black nation-state.37 Unthinkable revolution? Yes. Unthinkable revolution leading to an independent state? Just as impossible\u2014and potentially more dangerous. Ulysse makes this point plain in her NACLA Report essay, \u201cWhy Representations of Haiti Matter Now More than Ever.\u201d In assessing the pejorative imaging of Haiti from its origins to the twenty-first century, Ulysse argues that it \u201chad to become colonialism\u2019s b\u00eate noire [literally translated as \u201cblack beast\u201d] if the sanctity of whiteness were to remain unquestioned.\u201d38", "As a nation formed through rebellion, violence and anti-colonialism, Haiti would represent the least \u201cnormal\u201d nation in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world as it outlawed slavery from the beginning and articulated, at least on paper, that all of its citizens were politically equal and black. In one of Haiti\u2019s earliest constitutions, all Haitian citizens were legally defined as black, regardless of skin-pigmentation or prior racial categorisation. These political moves and assertions put the nation at odds with the nation-states in the Atlantic that surrounded it. As historian Julia Gaffield succinctly notes in Haitian Connections in the Atlantic World, \u201cthe basis of the economic system of the Atlantic world was under attack\u201d after Haiti\u2019s 12-year battle for freedoms, rights and opportunities drew a successful slave revolution and violent anti-colonial struggle into a concentrated fight for independence that would, improbably, defeat the French\u2014while also seeing off challenges from English and Spanish forces who saw an opportunity to take the island by force.39", "Although often cast as a ragtag, untrained cadre of blood-thirsty agitators, especially by antagonists in France, England and the USA, Haitian revolutionary leaders (and their representatives) spent considerable time influencing foreign officials, developing new strategic governance models (or building upon older colonial models) and working out how to perform sovereign politics amongst other sovereign nations, while black. For these and other reasons, Haiti was and remains, due to its history, a vastly important political entity.40 As Malick Ghachem notes regarding Haiti\u2019s official declaration of anti-colonial freedom, \u201cthe mere existence of Haiti, the very fact of its new ruling class, and the act of the declaration itself\u2014all of these were momentously novel forces in the Atlantic World.\u201d41", "In short, it was led by people of African descent who declared in their performance of power and rights that black people could be racialised as black and political. In The Haitian Declaration of Independence: Creation, Context, and Legacy, David Armitage, Julia Gaffield, Laurent Dubois and Erin Zavitz make clear that what could be read as a singular \u201cDeclaration of Haitian Independence\u201d should rightfully be seen as \u201cacts\u201d of becoming that took multiple forms and were performed on varied stages. Through song, oral history and in print forms that circulated the Atlantic world, Haitian leaders and Haitian people signalled a refusal to unbecoming.42 The new nation\u2019s very existence ran counter to pejorative assumptions and increasingly vitriolic racist imaginings that systematically rejected the ability of people of African descent to be creative, exhibit intelligence or even understand politics, much less engage in political behaviour and activities. In asserting their rights to sovereignty and working with various tools and circuits of power and production to communicate those rights, Haiti and its officials rewrote the rules about who could and could not be a sovereign body, as well as how that sovereignty would be performed. This book explores that terrain. The Unfinished Revolution: Haiti, Black Sovereignty and Power in the Nineteenth-Century Atlantic World chronicles the ways that Haiti\u2019s black sovereignty moved and morphed in the Atlantic world. Tethered, then, between a kind of \u201cothered\u201d space, Haitian officials would use whatever means were at their disposal to resist closure to and consumption of their independence and power, from letters, photographs, material objects, narratives, diplomatic missives, black and brown bodies, essays, newspaper articles to political performances on the world stage. What emerges from these oppositional, yet imploring demands is a sovereignty that celebrates, even as it rejects, its outlaw status.", "In 1853, Benjamin C. Clark, Haitian Commercial Agent to the USA (more on him in later chapters), argues in A Plea for Hayti that Atlantic nation-states, specifically the USA and Britain, failed to recognise and adequately to engage diplomatically with Haiti not simply because the USA\u2019s continued practice of Atlantic racial slavery was until the 1860s incompatible with the anti-slavery demands of the new Haitian nation-state. For Clark, at the heart of the antipathy toward Haiti was a deep resentment of its very existence. Haiti was not merely the product of a successful slave revolt: it was a black nation-state. And this identity made it an oddity within an Atlantic world that had no category for black political entities (in the form either of nations or citizens). Clark suggests that Haiti\u2019s oddness was not just unthinkable: it was outside the bounds of custom and law. In a stirring passage, he stresses that the USA\u2019s failure to engage with Haiti as a sovereign entity was at odds with its engagement with other independent Latin American countries. Clark argues that this differential diplomatic treatment was because \u201cthe horrors of St. Domingo were raked up and interposed, and it was contended that these Islanders having achieved their freedom by bloodshed, should forever be regarded as outlaws.\u201d43 And they were not just any outlaws. They were self-avowed black ones who dared to perform their power on a global stage amongst an ocean of white nation-states and their official and unofficial representatives.", "Nineteenth-century Haiti\u2019s outward-facing officials and their cognates from various economic industries and artistic sectors performed a form of racial power that utilised older and newly formed networks of influence to reposition and rearticulate Haiti\u2019s presence in the Atlantic world as a black space steeped in political power. Neither organised nor always coherent, this image-making of sovereignty assembled often unstable figurations of control and characterisations of power that when read together formulate a singular black political body that represented (and continues to represent) a sovereignty formed through encounters with and amongst other sovereign nation-states (more on this below). What has been gathered here in one text are the ways that a variety of agents and actants fought for, against, in tandem with and in praise of Haiti\u2019s black sovereignty. Through this examination, what emerges is not a fight for a specific cause but a series of jumbled and, at times, competing strategies for state control.", "These strategies (and the encounters that gave birth to them) illuminate the ways in which Haitian officials, their designated political and cultural attendants and external others would use various geopolitical and economic openings within a changing and volatile Caribbean region to configure Haiti. Many nineteenth-century Haitian leaders engaged in Haiti\u2019s international work found their sovereignty consistently compromised by outside agents who treated the nation as an exception in need of external control. Sociologist Alex Dupuy, writing about power and class in twenty-first-century Haiti, provides a roadmap to these earlier sovereignty struggles in Haiti, suggesting that \u201cif by sovereignty we mean the right and the ability of a people and their government to determine their agenda,\u201d then this right and ability is compromised and undermined \u201cwhen the state is subordinated to the dictates of foreign governments and international financial institutions, and/ or the interests of powerful private foreign and domestic actors who are not accountable to the people or their government.\u201d44 Dupuy\u2019s short list roughly captures the various interests exhibited by foreign officials, government agencies and financial organisations in their more than 200-plus-year encounters with Haiti.", "Although nineteenth-century Haitian officials would court, entrap, ensnare, play with and even manipulate the terms of many of the diplomatic and economic state-crafting of their times, other nations also played key roles in these dramas. Here is a short list of some of these political \u201cacts\u201d: the USA engaged in trade embargoes against Haiti in the early 1800s in order to isolate the young nation; France levied a crippling indemnity in 1825 of 150 million francs that forced the former colony to pay its colonial masters for its independence; and US banks took over the nation at the end of the nineteenth century near the start of the US military\u2019s occupation of Haiti that lasted, in total, almost 20 long and violent years.45 By the time the late twentieth-century structural adjustment programmes and internal coups brought Haiti under the protection (or, some would suggest, control) of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (Mission des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en Ha\u00efti or MINU STA H) force and auspices of the US State Department, Haiti had lived through centuries of compromise and undermining\u2014and responded to each episode with even more figurations of black sovereignty.", "Some pundits, influenced by accounts in the media and international governance documents that frame Haiti as a failed state, may see my interrogation of sovereignty in Haiti as a naive dream that Haiti could instantiate its own political future. I can anticipate that many of these same people, critical of Haiti and the political aptitude of its leaders, will pick up this book and doubt if a failed state could ever be, or even had ever been, a sovereign one. This book responds to these and similar conjectures with a simple, but important, question: \u201cWhat makes Haiti a failed state?\u201d Some of those in the development world and within international relations circles point to Haiti\u2019s poverty levels (perhaps reciting the mantra: Haiti is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere) or its lack of institutional infrastructures as examples of its failure. The issues of poverty and infrastructural collapse may be visible in Haiti, but other nations have significant poverty levels and little or no internally coordinated agencies or organisations. What makes Haiti so especially different, so critically difficult, that it merits a charge of failure at its roots or claims by the media of suffering from a \u201ccomplex web of progress-resistant cultural influences\u201d?46", "This line of questioning is not about apportioning blame on others for the ways that various Haitian elites have amassed wealth and allocated resources within Haiti to the detriment of the masses. I raise the spectre of failure to make clear that in repeating Haiti\u2019s purported failure and then reading that failure back into Haiti\u2019s history, critics and supporters alike run the risk of never really understanding the routes that have brought various configurations of the nation into existence. In reading Haiti\u2019s history as a narrative of declension, whose high point is the Haitian Revolution, critics (and even some supporters) repeat the very acts of erasure that many claim silenced the Haitian Revolution for so many years to those outside of Haitian studies.", "We must do better by Haiti. We must challenge ourselves to witness Haiti\u2019s history and see its many resistances to charges of \u201cstate failure\u201d by its many presence(s) on the world stage. The Unfinished Revolution resists reifying the rhetoric of failure and instead lays bare the ways that its logics echo within criticism of Haiti\u2019s history and its continued political existence. In drawing together a range of documents, actors, nations and entanglements, this book moves conversations about Haiti beyond the polarities that tend to constrain it\u2014i.e., failed black nation on one side and idealised revolutionary spark of radical antislavery and anti-colonialism on the other.", "It responds to historical anthropologist and Francophone political theorist Gary Wilder\u2019s call for scholars to offer \u201cclear\u201d speaking about Haiti that attempts to chart its existence without resorting to \u201coverdetermined poles of abject failure and audacious triumph.\u201d Wilder stresses that circulating images of Haiti must be challenged if we\u2014in the widest sense of community\u2014ever hope to silence current articulations of Haiti as a \u201cphantasmic object of fear and desire\u201d that conjure fantastic notions of \u201cpolitical failure, social catastrophe, or natural disaster.\u201d47 In many ways, this book charts the tensions that have emerged from Haiti\u2019s unfinished project of creating a black sovereign nation-state under these conditions.", "In a 2010 talk delivered to the United Nations on the international day of remembrance for people brutalised by slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, political theorist and Africana studies scholar Anthony Bogues turns his lens to Haiti and its \u201carchive of freedom.\u201d Bogues argues that in order for the wider public to reframe Haiti as a freedom land, the international community must recognise that Haiti\u2019s revolutionary beginnings contained not one rebellion, but two. The first violent insurrection rejected slavery; the second, occurring years later, drew together a concentrated military force determined to fight against a return to colonialism and imperial control. In the pages that follow, I posit that there was\u2014and remains\u2014a third, and unfinished, revolution in Haiti: sovereignty. Although sovereignty has not emerged as a significant theme examined by scholars, Haitian politics, in general, has garnered critics\u2019 attention. Notably, researchers have produced exceptional new readings of Haiti\u2019s early constitutions (including Toussaint\u2019s pre-Haiti Constitution of 1801).48 These new considerations sit alongside other examinations of diplomacy, such as texts by Ronald Johnson and Ashli White, that seek to understand the struggles of the burgeoning nation to set up and defend its right to existence.49 These works are joined by a wide and varied body of texts that focus on Haiti\u2019s early political manifestations and its interactions with US literary history through examinations of such themes as the significance of the image and military acumen of Toussaint Louverture to black power in the Atlantic world and the writings of particular US authors who have written on or been influenced by Haitian culture and politics, such as Charles Brockden Brown, Herman Melville and Leonora Sansay, or the perspectives from some who spent considerable time in Haiti during the Haitian Revolution, including the British officer Marcus Rainsford.50 Francophone Caribbeanists have also considered the political world of Haiti. These scholars have offered new methods and new source materials that have helped document how the various figurations of early Haiti were rooted/routed through Haitian literature and the cultural and political worlds in the Americas and the wider French empire.51", "The above thematic sets of work have been influenced (in some instances, quite noticeably) by additional scholarship on Haiti crafted by social scientists, including the works of David Nicholls, J. Michael Dash, Michel- Rolph Trouillot, Sidney Mintz, Alex Dupuy, Arthur Stinchcombe and Anthony Maingot, each of whom has painstakingly documented tensions around development and political economy with regards to Haiti and Haiti\u2019s place within geopolitical structures of power.52 Aspects of these now classic texts can be found in newer pieces from interdisciplinary investigators, such as the work of Philip Kaisary, who moves within and between law, race and human rights, and Robbie Shilliam, who teases apart the entanglements between international politics, post-coloniality and global movements for decolonisation.53 Both Shilliam and Kaisary, alongside Matthew Smith, have produced nuanced texts focused on the Haitian Revolution, the early Haitian republic and later Haitian history that interrogate issues of Caribbean exile, capitalism, liberty and race. Although, as mentioned, aspects of politics or \u201cthe political\u201d play a role in the above-mentioned texts and in the wider work of some of the authors identified, sovereignty\u2014as a formative construction\u2014remains undertheorised.54", "The Unfinished Revolution grapples, cautiously, with race and sovereignty. It builds upon the scholarly openings provided by many of the above texts and projects, even as it amasses and assesses a new archive of nineteenthcentury and later materials that gesture toward the challenges, performances and articulations of nation-ness that contributed to (and may continue to shape) Haiti\u2019s black sovereignty. Although focused primarily on the long nineteenth century, The Unfinished Revolution does venture into later periods in order to illuminate the continued significance of Haiti\u2019s unfinished sovereign revolution to its current international battles\u2014including those that focus on economic, political or cultural issues. As opposed to being a text about the past, I have been urged, by the material, to recognise that these are ongoing struggles and configurations that remain ever present in political dramas facing Haiti, today. I do not aim in these temporal moves to capture every manifestation of continued resistance or battles. What emerges are instances of forward shifts in the narrative that speak directly to particular instances, tropes or figurations that make clear that the unfinished nature of Haiti\u2019s sovereignty will not be miraculously solved by some future form of political recognition. In weaving through time, I reconstruct the ways that these promises in the past have been laid out before\u2014and have not come to fruition. Time here is not a panacea to political dispossession and challenge. In fact, what bubbles forth from the archive are the many spirals of form, thought and resistance that move through and against the unfinished project of black sovereignty.55", "In what immediately follows, I offer up an expanded discussion of black sovereignty that makes clear the contours of the term, as articulated within these pages, and its use and relevancy as a framing device. In order to define the limits and potentials of this term, I first explore blackness in relation to sovereignty before tackling the exciting (yet, racially limited) field/debates within sovereignty studies. This discussion is finally followed by a detailed description of the chapters and themes contained within the text.", "Black is a Country: The Blackness of Black Sovereignty", "Although I use the term black sovereignty throughout the book, I do not deploy it lightly or use it without some trepidation. I recognise the vexed and problematic nature of reducing the complexities of sovereign power and the performances of it on the global stage into an amorphous (even as it may be generative and politically cohering), socially constructed racial category of distinction. For decades, critics have argued that blackness is \u201cslippery,\u201d often defying definition and eluding formal identification. As a result, it is often described as a signifying trope; a dynamic, conscious way of living; a forced conceptualisation; a mobilising idea; a social movement; a political demand; a creative impulse and (importantly) a socially constructed term that means (meant) none of the above.56 The field of black studies is enormous and constantly being reshaped by scholars around the globe who find within its generative space new forms of relationality and contestation. The deftness and nuance of performance artist and black queer theorist E. P atrick Johnson\u2019s work perhaps best captures the vitality (and interdisciplinarity) of critical approaches to the study of blackness. As Johnson notes in Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity, \u201c\u2018black\u2019 culture\u201d contains a \u201cproduction of blackness\u201d that involves a \u201cmutual constructing/deconstructing, avowing/disavowing, and expanding/ delimiting dynamic.\u201d57 In essence, it is a complex and charged figuration.", "Of course, we know that any assertions about blackness\u2019s essential qualities must be questioned. As scholars have argued for many decades within African diaspora studies, terms such as \u201cblack\u201d may hold some set ideas and historical constructions even as they mutate others once black and blackness become global and situated within specific spaces and wielded by specific actors to describe specific entities\u2014whether people, places or things. Deployed in different settings and at different times, these labels may enable, as well as constrain, certain conclusions about the performance of difference\u2014and who can be configured within its sphere. As anyone who studies racialisation and racialisms in a global perspective knows, what constitutes hierarchies of being in one location does not have to be regarded the same way in another.58 New forms of difference, even when marked against the same body, may enable someone never to see race in their daily lives or be marked as different by others primarily through frameworks informed by that body\u2019s immediate location. (Here I am thinking about friends from areas such as Bahia, in north-eastern Brazil, who see themselves one way and then travel to the USA or the United Kingdom and are marked differently by a new system of racialisation or difference.)", "As we seek out ways to investigate the transnational vectors and cultural networks that mobilise blackness and the flows of blackness in particular ways, we must also develop methods that allow us to understand how specific political systems and institutions racialise, erase or even re-racialise specific bodies for political purposes. \u201cBlack\u201d as a demarcation of a political body/nation, may operate in a similar manner. There is still more research needed in order fully to comprehend the ways that race and nation politically intersect at the international level and impact governance structures and relations between particular nation-states\u2014especially nations such as Haiti, Abyssinia and Liberia\u2014whose nineteenth-century exceptionalism marked them as different. Essayist and novelist Teju Cole makes clear the dilemma about the admiration (ostensibly on the part of white Americans and Europeans) of black exceptions: \u201cIn the presence of the admirable, some are breathless not with admiration but with rage. They object to the presence of the black body (an unarmed boy in a street, a man buying a toy, a dancer on the subway, a bystander) as much as they object to the presence of the black mind.\u201d Cole frames these objections in ways similar to Trouillot\u2019s silences, but notes something far more damning about the negation: it profits from \u201cblack labor and black innovation,\u201d or what Cole describes as the \u201cco-option of black life.\u201d59 Although this refrain is not the main impetus for this book, there is an echo of it within the history of enforced labour, co-opted lands or meandering credit and inflated geopoliticking in the region. While some nations may have disavowed Haiti, still others courted the nation for its resources\u2014be those people or material things.", "Rather than an exercise in arguing for Haiti\u2019s legitimacy within histories of dispossession, this book situates Haiti\u2019s unfinished revolution as an ongoing project that continually produces, even as it recasts, black political thought and nation-state action. It takes the form of a standard academic monograph, but this final product sits uneasily in this form. This discomfiture is a testimony less to the prematurity of the investigation than the contrapuntal aspects of the terms of discovery, the slipperiness of statecraft and the difficulties in finding a point of origin.", "In writing this text, I found myself immersed in what critical race theorist and cultural theorist Jared Sexton describes, in his musings on the political geography of black lives, as moments thinking \u201cabout the unspeakable, perhaps unimaginable ways that black lives have been devalued,\u201d where you\u2014as the crafter of this tale\u2014\u201chave trouble determining when to start the story\u2014or history or mythology or fable\u2014or how far afield to draw your sphere of concern.\u201d60 This uncertainty adequately captures the dilemma of imagining and articulating Haiti\u2019s black sovereignty as it has emerged within a consistently demeaning and delimiting political world quite often fuelled by racialisms and determinants of political impossibility for those of African descent. Balancing this searching for with a critique of the failings of the frames of race and international relations is a difficult\u2014some would even argue impossible\u2014task.", "Yet, this work is more than just an act of recovery regarding Haiti\u2019s political struggle. It is also a search for a framework that corresponds, in many ways, with writer, filmmaker and cultural critic Frank B. Wilderson III \u2019s call for a \u201cconceptual framework, predicated not on the subject-effect of cultural performance but on the structure of political ontology, a framework that allows us to substitute a culture of politics for a politics of culture.\u201d61 In order to recognise this framework, we\u2014scholars, activists, critics and casual observers alike\u2014must attune our instruments of knowing (spirit, critical thinking, rhythms, etc.) in order to bear witness to the power of black sovereignty and the stultifying aspects of negrophobia/black nullification that exist within transnational sovereignty\u2019s roots and make the ontological struggle of black sovereignty so compelling. Forcing sovereignty to grapple with blackness offers up the chance to study black sovereignty\u2019s many modes and practices: its power, and, to borrow from poet and cultural critic Fred Moten, its \u201cthingliness, even as (absolute) nothingness, even as imprisonment in passage on the most open road of all, even as\u2014to use and abuse a terribly beautiful phrase of [Frank] Wilderson\u2019s (2010: ix)\u2014fantasy in the hold.\u201d62", "Back in Haiti, though, blackness has had a long and contentious history as a demarcation of citizenship, an African ancestral-spiritual connector and as part of a movement (and a weapon in the hands of politicians such as Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier) of power along class and colour lines\u2014pivoting Haiti, at times, culturally between France and Africa. Cultural critic and critical legal scholar Colin Dayan notes how Haiti, \u201ccalled variously \u2018Black France\u2019 by one nineteenth-century observer\u201d and \u201ca tropical dog-kennel and pestiferous jungle\u201d by another, has always been \u201cmoved uneasily between the extremes of [black] idealization and [black] debasement.\u201d63 Dayan continues by noting, \u201cthe business of being Haitian [as in the nation-state] was more complex\u201d than these simple categories express.64", "Dayan\u2019s observations nod to the entangled racialisation and colourisation that divided Haiti in its colonial form in the eighteenth century. It also firmly rejects philosopher and historian Ernest Renan\u2019s infamous suggestion that race matters only to historians interested in humanity and \u201chas no applications, however, in politics.\u201d65 Blackness mattered so much to Haiti\u2019s revolutionary leaders that the very first constitution of the young nation declared that all Haitian citizens would be marked/coded as \u201cblack,\u201d regardless of their previously applied, chosen or assumed racial category. While Haiti\u2019s new leaders chose a name for the nation that forever linked it to its indigenous past (as \u201cAyiti\u201d is a Ta\u00edno word that means mountainous land), they constitutionally cast their citizens as universally black, or what Doris Garraway describes as a \u201cnegative universalism.\u201d66 These black citizens, even with their internal divisions in terms of status and wealth, charged into the Atlantic world and challenged\u2014with their very presence and continued existence\u2014that black people, , even those deemed inhuman and unpolitical by others have the right to sovereignty. This book assembles a rich and unexamined archive of power and political practice that provides the contours and evidence of political theorist Siba Grovogui\u2019s claim that \u201csovereignty takes form through multiple, complex, and differentiated institutions that congeal into formal and informal regimes of authority and practices\u201d that look vastly different when coded black or seen through the lens of race.67 As tempting as it might be to offer a list of patterns or definitive tropes, I have moved to resist the comfiture of the all-knowing intellectual. As a journey, what appears here is less the final word than an opening into a political terrain of discovery. There is, therefore, much to learn.", "These racialised differences often erupted into challenges by foreign others to Haiti\u2019s sovereignty that tended to carry within them certain thinly veiled racisms. The encounters often appeared within diplomatic and international circles, especially as nation-states discussed, negotiated, crafted or figured Haiti into their plans. Although external agents often played key roles in the narrativisation of Haiti as black and \u201cother\u201d in these encounters, Haitian politicians and their intermediaries did not sit by as silent actors in their own national/international dramatic story. Instead, many would insist on manipulating, curating, challenging or even assisting the terms used and the assumptions made during these negotiations\u2014for their own political benefit and not necessarily those of the nation\u2019s citizens. Recovering these narratives is important, but so too is understanding how this state-crafting has been and continues to be influenced by racial formations and the unfinished project that is Haiti\u2019s revolutionary sovereignty.", "The challenges encountered by Haiti\u2019s founding band of agitators, activists, conspirators and freedom fighters still resonate today, as Haiti and its various leaders engage in battles and negotiations with (or, at times, abet) outside financiers, internal power brokers and international \u201ckeepers\u201d of the peace over Haiti\u2019s precarious labouring populace and the nation\u2019s resources (including those found amongst its people and within its environment). Sociologist and Caribbeanist Mimi Sheller argues in an important essay on \u201cHaitian Fear\u201d that how and what we discuss about Haiti \u201cwill continue to have a significant impact on international relations and racial formations\u201d in Haiti.68 What Sheller sees as Haitian impacts, I see as more Atlantic and global concerns. Motivated, in part, by the racial projects that attempt to categorise and de-limit the political and sovereign work of Haiti and its politicians, this book charts how this state-work would be cast and performed by Haitians.", "Although significant things have been done to Haiti by external others, critics must begin to understand the ways that Haitian officials utilised various conduits of power and influence to craft their version of black statehood in the midst of these external pressures and tensions. What emerges from this multi-directional flow of narratives, counter narratives and cultural diplomacy is a dialogue of power brokering that forms a layered and racially charged conversation about politics and sovereignty\u2014and which entities can embody or be recognised, externally, as having or expressing those characteristics. This is more than just a simple discussion about exclusion.", "Constitutional law scholar Hent Kalmo and intellectual historian Quentin Skinner assert, in a critique of sovereignty\u2019s purported obsolescence (amongst other topics), that sovereignty remains an important ambiguous term worth exploring for the very reason that in \u201canswering the question as to what sovereignty is,\u201d critics also have to deal with an additional linked question that cannot be separated from the first\u2014namely, \u201cwho is thought to be its proper bearer.\u201d69 ", "Much of the recent political and development aid rhetoric regarding Haiti\u2019s \u201cfailed state\u201d status hinges on the premise that Haiti bears no resemblance to a functioning sovereign state. Although some critics point to various causes for Haiti\u2019s perceived failures\u2014such as foreign intervention, unequal power, corruption or political instability\u2014this book asserts that any list of Haiti\u2019s perceived \u201cproblems\u201d must include the challenges and manipulations amongst international bodies and nation-states over Haiti\u2019s sovereign existence. This is, as described above, an unfinished issue.", "There are important reasons for revisiting Haiti\u2019s unfinished sovereign revolution and its sovereign practices. One, the arrival of the new nation of Haiti in the Atlantic world brought with it sweeping political changes\u2014 especially regarding the ideation of freedom, liberty and power\u2014and who had the rights to have, demand and exhibit any of these conditions. This demand, startling and ground-breaking in the nineteenth century, shook the foundations of difference, possession, rights-taking and capital accumulation that many European empires relied upon to build their colonial machines. The arrival of Haiti, and its revolutionary beginnings, would have profound impacts on later rebellions, uprisings, power demands and even national movements across the globe.", "While Haiti\u2019s revolution has been celebrated and remains a touchstone for various human rights campaigns because of its embodiment of anti-slavery and anti-colonialism, Haiti\u2019s sovereign arrival\u2014and the impact of its continued political existence\u2014remain unexamined. And we know that its representation mattered and continues to matter in twenty-first-century rhetorics of aid and humanitarianism. Haiti\u2019s name is invoked\u2014especially in coverage in the media\u2014as an anomaly. It may no longer be cast as a savage, violent country, but far too many identify it as a lawless, inept one.70 There is a second important reason to tread into this subject area. Haiti remains a nation caught between the tethers of neoliberalism and planetary sovereignty (although it could be argued that these terms describe similar motivations of control). More has to be done to disentangle these frames of relationality from old and new forms of racialisms (see Chapters 2 and 3 for more on these processes).71 And, finally, Haiti\u2019s particular political situation provides substantive examples of the frames and possibilities of power and resistance for those engaged in global discussions and negotiations about dispossession, rights and environmental impact, such as the many conversations and agitations regarding the future of Kiribati and its people.72", "Adding Haiti\u2019s environmental crises into these larger global considerations of contested and racialised zones, such as Nauru, should enable scholars, critics, scientists, community groups, environmentalists and planners to recognise how, as Sheller asserts, \u201cinterpretations, representations, and explanations of Haiti continue to serve ongoing \u2018efforts to reorganize and redistribute resources along particular racial [or colonial] lines.\u2019\u201d73 What Sheller illuminates and The Unfinished Revolution begins to chart are the ways that these economic and political redistributions and reorganisations hinge on the destabilisation of sovereignty and the currency of racialisation or difference.", "In offering up the term \u201cblack sovereignty,\u201d I recognise that I have set this text within a vexed area of scholarship regarding the black Atlantic, black politics and black nations in which blackness is neither easily nor often clearly defined in relation to territorially bounded political structures and institutions. (Of course, the same could be said for sovereignty and nationness, but let\u2019s work through one theoretical battle at a time.) Although I have briefly argued above why Haiti\u2019s sovereignty could be coded black, the question remains what is symbolised either about race or politics with or perhaps through this articulation. When we\u2014as critics\u2014configure blackness in association with political bodies, such as nation-states, public bodies or communities, does it describe shared experiences (such as Atlantic racial slavery or cultural connections to Africa); certain political imaginings and resistances (such as those espoused by N\u00e9gritude, the African Blood Brotherhood or the Black Panthers); or is it merely the recognition of a majority or a minority population within a bounded territory (such as the \u201crace\u201d of the main population of Jamaica or the racio-cultural place-coding implied in the term \u201cblack America\u201d)? These questions are not just about numbers, majority or minority status, political ties and cultural memory. What people are called, how they organise themselves through or against these designations, and the ways that other groups recognise or categorise them influences how they may mobilise or construct themselves\u2014and how others may frame their existence. ", "From a political standpoint, these categorisations and recognitions may carry even greater weight during intergovernmental encounters, delimiting, constraining or even opening certain pathways and articulations of rights, freedoms and liberation strategies during various sensitive debates, negotiations and diplomatic encounters. Black may not be a country, but, for those who experience life as an \u201coutsider\u201d within, it may be the closest thing to a coherency that they have, even as the connective potential of \u201cblackness\u201d gets reshaped by some political agents as a weapon of control or difference.74", "As suggested above, identifying a nation as a black nation-state may productively trouble the ways that populations utilise racial codes of distinction (such as the vexed role of \u201ccolour\u201d in Haiti, more broadly) and the ways that racialised codes of aggregation may be utilised by internal and external others for political purposes. An example? When pundits in the USA talk about \u201cblack America\u201d are they cohering a range of perspectives, people, experiences and ideas into something that is aligned with, but yet separate from, the generic USA? Does \u201cblack America\u201d identify a cultural group only lightly and tangentially affiliated with the political entity that is \u201cAmerica\u201d? Or does \u201cblack America\u201d signal some entity or thing that manages to live in the land and within the imagination, as a lived theory that can buffer the struggles of existence facing many people of African descent in the USA? On a more personal point: what happens when a black American who identifies as female lives and works in the United Kingdom and encounters diversity information that labels her as black \u201cOther\u201d? In other words: what is blackness and what does it do to political entities, territories and bodies (in the collective sense) as they move and encounter new forms of legal entanglements and political challenges?", "Returning to Haiti with these questions illuminates additional tensions. What are the dangers in investigating black sovereignty as a strategy of international power in a country where colourism politics have divided governmental bodies and citizens since its beginnings\u2014reaching its most tragic juxtapositioning in the twentieth century\u2019s \u201cnoirisme\u201d movement and the rise and destructive power of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier?75", "While these and similar questions push at the structure and foundations of this book, and keep me up most nights, they are not this book\u2019s main focus. I raise these issues mostly to do battle with my own thoughts on race and national and international politics and openly to place on the table the difficult issues that trouble this research\u2014even as I work to tackle them. As I grapple with \u201cstates\u201d of blackness\u2014in a political and global sense\u2014I remain convinced that just as we need new narratives of Haiti and other self-avowed and internationally marked black nation-states we also need new frames of articulation that allow us to understand racialisms and politics even as we seek ways to redraw power within and outside of international systems of governance. These redrawings have taken on significant urgency as notable areas, such as the USA, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, confront shifting forms of racism (and fascism) within their political structures.76 These are elusive and slippery terms to quantify and capture. Refusing to try and understand black sovereignty, though, is something that we cannot continue to do. Lives, I believe, depend on our bearing witness to its moves and its continued work\u2014positively and negatively\u2014in shaping Haiti\u2019s and other black nation-states\u2019 futures. What I have written above, and what circles these pages, are difficult and contentious issues that have attracted political philosophers, activists and theorists to work through and on them.77 The reasons people turn to them are the very reasons that I have placed them for us to consider in this introduction: they impact on the \u201cblack\u201d world and our figurations of it. As a singular body of work, this text does not aim to solve the problem of blackness within nation-state sovereignty but to highlight that it actually is a problem worth discussing. Although political theorists, such as Siba Grovogui, have written about blackness, race and sovereignty, much of the discussion on sovereignty and quasi-sovereignty focuses on indigenous sovereignty or the tumultuous mid-twentieth-century movements for decolonisation that reverberated around portions of what is often referred to as the Global South\u2014movements that articulated a vastly different version of the \u201crising tide of color\u201d that Lothrop Stoddard feared in the 1920s.78 Although indebted to Grovogui, and others, for their keen twentieth-century observations, this book places sovereignty and blackness into historical context by examining a challenge to sovereignty rooted much further back in time than the decolonisation movements of the twentieth century and grounded by figurations of race.79", "The Unfinished Revolution, then, works consciously, to situate these processes within international relations, the performances of power and global politics. Even as it examines these considerations and gathers a heretofore unexplored and untheorised set of material objects associated with them, it remains committed to ensuring that additional work adds to this dialogue. And it is a dialogic exchange that is envisioned here as these objects speak to and from the times and situations that gave them meaning. The archive assembled for this project makes clear the precariousness of power as performed by particular racialised and politicised bodies\u2014and the responses by multiple players to this precarity. It asks questions about the forms of this performance, its tropic dimensions and its responses (and adaptations) to the shifting dynamics of blackness and power in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world, even as it charts Haitian leaders\u2019 and their representatives\u2019 demands for reciprocity, sovereign equality and recognition from other sovereign entities. These demands, occurring in divergent circumstances and situations, such as private letters, diplomatic cables or cultural products, circulated through established capitalist flows of knowledge throughout the Atlantic world, drew together competing and, oftentimes, compelling figurations of black sovereignty and empire.", "National leaders on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean struggled to recognise Haiti as an equal nation-state throughout the nineteenth century, especially one capable of engaging in sovereign decision-making. But this refusal and declared disavowal is only part of the story.80 Sources from the assembled archive within this volume amply demonstrate that many of the agents who refused politically to recognise Haiti encouraged\u2014either directly or through various economic agents\u2014commercial and military entanglements with Haiti. Although some media and political agents were quick to label Haiti\u2019s entire machinery of state power as the \u201cbest burlesque\u201d the world had ever seen, others sought ways to harness Haiti\u2019s resources or direct its capital. And Haitian officials often fed off or even manipulated this \u201chunger\u201d for their own means. Meanwhile, public discourses on both sides of the Atlantic grappled with how best to describe and deal with Haiti, the political entity.", "US newspaper accounts from around the mid-nineteenth century routinely portray Haiti as a political absurdity.81 As a nation, Haiti was dubbed the Atlantic world\u2019s foolish parody. Its monarchs, emperors and presidents represented the punchline of comical dark jokes\u2014as if shades of colour and politics could never mix. Haiti\u2019s attempts at engaging in statecraft were often mocked and its leaders recast in sketches as simian-like creatures ridiculously attempting to engage in politics. Critics have produced a body of literature that charts these caricatures and isolation\u2014especially as they relate to the early years of Haiti\u2019s existence.82 This text dives into this archive and begins to ask what Haiti\u2019s black sovereignty is and how have the battles to be/ remain sovereign responded to racialisms and racisms within the sectors of politics and international relations. In considering this history, the text places these older battles for sovereignty within current transnational and extragovernmental initiatives and projects aimed at Haiti\u2019s current economic and political future. The next section lays out some of the stakes of these battles for authority within sovereignty before turning to an overview of the book\u2019s chapters.", "Sovereignty without Power: The Role of Race in the Battle for Authority", "As a text about Haiti and its articulation, construction and performance of sovereign power in the nineteenth century, The Unfinished Revolution does not simply argue that Haiti has been on the receiving end of ostracisation since its inception. Although non-recognition (at different times and within different contexts) from France, the United Kingdom and the USA carried with it significant penalties for Haiti, Haitian politicians, their official and unofficial designees and cultural representatives routinely staged oppositional performances of empowerment. By refusing politically to engage with Haiti, various international political actors (such as US President Thomas Jefferson, who was in office from 1801 to 1809) consciously deployed strategies of disengagement, or perhaps controlled engagement, that framed exchanges with Haitian officials and their intermediaries as variations of \u201cnot\u201d\u2014not politics, not recognition, not reciprocity and definitely not transnational exchanges as equal sovereign nations. In framing these diplomatic and quasi-diplomatic conversations and entanglements around \u201cnots,\u201d Jefferson and others stressed that they did not see people of African descent as beings capable of articulating, crafting or practising politics.83 Although many of these politicos rejected or outwardly struggled with the radical antislavery potential of the Haitian Revolution (and its violence), they also refused to assign political power to any entity\u2014including nations\u2014coded as black. The Haitian Revolution may have inspired fantasies and fuelled nightmares of a contagion of slave upheavals, but it also stirred up deep chasms between abstract notions and articulations of freedom and the type of people who had the right to claim those ideas for themselves on an individual, collective and nation-state level.", "Political theorist Siba Grovogui traces some of this history, its impact on international relations and the role of sovereignty within these processes. In an important chapter discussing these issues, Grovogui examines the impact of the American, French and Haitian Revolutions on sovereignty\u2019s contemporary construction. He concludes that \u201ccenturies before the modern Refugee Convention, the Helsinki Accords, and the philosophical treatises of Giorgio Agamben and Hannah Arendt, Haitian slaves had pondered bare existence and the right to those so reduced to such an existence to claim sovereign rights for themselves.\u201d These rights-claimers, Grovogui continues, demanded in their continued national existence that people of African descent, including formerly enslaved persons, had \u201cequal access to the resources of life\u201d and power.84", "Grovogui\u2019s theoretical moves, above, suggest the tensions that exist within sovereignty studies between articulations about who has access to (or controls) the so-called \u201cresources of life,\u201d how power moves between the entities connected within sovereignty\u2019s web and who ultimately wields sovereign authority. Political geographer John Agnew occupies a specific role within these debates. Rather than arguing the case for sovereignty\u2019s elusiveness or its irrelevancy in our hyper-global world, Agnew takes aim at the artificial aspects of its supposed spatial demarcations. In other words, sovereignty can extend beyond state and territorial borders due to the networks that power uses to travel or the multiple outside entities that a sovereign state has to encounter. Agnew does not reject the state as superfluous. Instead, he reimagines state power as deterritorialised, setting his theories in opposition to critics who argue for either the centrality of globalisation (see sociologist Sassia Sassken for more on this) or the impact of liquid modernity upon the transnational circuits of power that fuel \u201cextraction zones\u201d and repeated cycles of dispossession.85", "What Agnew stresses is the geography of sovereignty\u2014and its unequal moves. In recognising the disparateness in which sovereignty can tether legitimacy to the wielding of state violence in the name of \u201cdefending the state,\u201d Agnew draws attention to the ways in which sovereign claims or the practice of acting as a sovereign sets up a relational field in which only designated sets of actors are able to engage within certain political projects. This is a powerful situational field of engagement and disavowal that has significant domestic and international implications. As Agnew states, \u201cclaims to sovereignty provide the linguistic coin in which both domestic and international politics are transacted.\u201d86 Although Agnew\u2019s case studies are read through the lens of deterritorialisation and not race (in counterdistinction to my reading of black sovereignty), we nevertheless share a conviction that \u201csovereignty is made out of the circulation of power among a range of actors at dispersed sites rather than simply emanating outward from an original and commanding central point.\u201d87 Agnew takes aim at the abstracted state, but his evaluations of sovereign practice involve little consideration of \u201crace matters\u201d within these processes.", "The same is true of other international relations scholars who mostly resist discussing race. The potential importance of race to sovereignty lies just beneath the surface in many of these discussions. Take, for example, the work of international relations scholar Jens Bartelson, who, in writing about the indivisibility of sovereignty and its \u201csymbolic form,\u201d takes the reader through a historical reconceptualisation of early theorists of sovereignty\u2014namely, Hobbes, Bodin and Grotius\u2014while noting that even as scholars grapple with definitions of sovereignty and its legal and potentially extraterritorial contours, \u201csovereignty cannot simply be wished away, since it has been foundational to the differentiation of modern political life into a domestic and an international space.\u201d88 If race and difference have played roles in domestic, military and imperial expansions, so too must they dance along the contours of sovereign articulations. We must not ignore sovereignty\u2019s origins, its mutations over time as certain nation states have been absorbed within it\u2014or distinguished as different\u2014or the implications of these distinctions for exceptional nation-states. For the purposes of this book, it is clear that sovereignty\u2019s nation-state beginnings do not include political bodies that represent people of African descent. By default, race must play a key role, as political entities demarcated as non-white would have been denied sovereign recognition at their conception.", "Scholars such as Kevin Bruyneel have written extensively about indigenous or tribal sovereignty, especially as it relates to indigenous and aboriginal communities and First Nation peoples within North America, South America, Africa and the Pacific. Alongside work by Grovogui, these examinations within sovereignty studies have critiqued the limitations of tribal or quasi-sovereignty, including those within decolonised and paracolonial spaces still economically or politically tied (some would say controlled) by former imperial powers. These two strands of scholarship are extensive and growing and help support much of the considerations of race that inform my readings of sovereignty.

Clearly, a modern sensibility governs representations of early modern slavery, whereby the institution largely figures as an economic trope. The slave appears as an abject subject under dominion of the master but now untethered from the oikos, which characterized the ancient and medieval world 's instantiation of slavery. In place of dominion-which linked the slave and slavery to politics-the market and difference govern the institution. Through this prism, slavery no longer operated under the earlier formulation of power whose genealogy was traceable to the ancient world. For this reason, when theorists reference the slave, they depict modern relations in which both the master and the slave struggle for affirmation as liberal (individual) subjects. This very (modern) subjectivity informs the sociologist and social theorist Orlando Patterson's description of the slave. Indeed, Patterson's depiction already embodies the subjectivity of an individual on whom violence was continually enacted. In this respect, Patterson-despite his emphasis on enslavement as an act of natal alienation configured the slave as an Enlightenment subject-the individual-while also implicating the master-slave dialect in a drama cast and staged by the Enlightenment: beings conceiving of themselves, their autonomy, and freedom in terms that always already assumed a form rooted in the temporality associated with the Enlightenment. This obviously represents an ahistorical representation, which has accompanied our general embrace of Patterson's social death formulation. This realization may surprise-though curiously has attracted little attention-given that Patterson is also the scholar who long ago claimed that we needed to historicize our representations of slavery and freedom. Contrary to his insistence that we delineate the process of making chattel, Patterson's historicizing does not extend to the Enlightenment temporality that the slave inhabits. Since a subjectivity rooted in the late eighteenth century could not have served as the antithesis of the very categories engendered by the Enlightenment, which includes natal alienation, I would argue that the dynamic of making a slave in the early modern period demands a distinct history and still requires a theorization. In lieu of such a distinct historical logic with its accompanying social forms, the dispossessed, uprooted, and alienated individual-forged in the eighteenth century-remains the universal subject of the slave past. At its core, the project at hand points to an unacknowledged and unwritten history in which the subject, the individual, is seen as a process that involves uprooting persons from the only form of sociality, the polis however conceived-and thereby attending to how the making of a slave as the progenitor of the modern individual entails an engagement with a more nuanced story of power with which former selves were associated. To excavate this long-neglected history demands configuring slavery in relationship to sovereign power. Until such time, we will not have a complicated history of power in the framing of the African past and in the early modern African diaspora: such histories are of critical importance in narrating the story of power. For this reason, I have insisted on bringing sovereign power into our discussion of the African-European encounter and the history of the African diaspora, and also to suggest that this history of the state, as one instantiation of sovereign power, represents a foundational framing for understanding how the individual (but also the ethnic and the cultural) emerges. Here it might be useful to recall my earlier claim: the African diaspora has moved away from its conceptualization rooted in state destruction-an act whereby an external or imperial assault-destroys the polity of another people, thus rendering them stateless beings. The African diaspora, in turn, has become an analytical framing that varies on a continuum of shared consciousness, culture, and racial ancestry, while the state remains noticeably absent. Stated differently, slavery once figured prominently in the discourse on power, yet in its recent history, early modern political theorists conceived of slavery as an economic system and a means for coercing labor, thereby reducing its more complicated relationship to power; even Hegel who repositions the master-slave dialectic back into the realm of power does so around the modern abstraction of the individual embodied in the slave and the master. Early modern theorists and travelers, however, were not in a position to conceive of autonomous individuals and seemed not to have lost sight of the relationship between trade and sovereignty."], "id": "356d699e61ff3291c2f725d2a2ff8f80c578ec3581d4077faea1e4ee7ce1e29e", "highlighted_text": " when theorists reference the slave , they depict the master and the slave struggle for affirmation as liberal subjects Patterson's  depiction embodies an individual on whom violence was continually enacted This represents an ahistorical representation Patterson also claimed we needed to historicize representations of slavery and freedom the dispossessed and alienated individual remains the universal subject of the slave past To excavate this history demands configuring slavery in relationship to sovereign power the African diaspora has moved away from its conceptualization rooted in state destruction whereby assault - destroys the polity of another people The African diaspora has become an analytical framing the state remains noticeably absent", "highlights": [[3, 714, 728], [3, 729, 748], [3, 748, 749], [3, 750, 761], [3, 793, 811], [3, 812, 853], [3, 867, 875], [3, 1007, 1018], [3, 1018, 1018], [3, 1019, 1028], [3, 1037, 1045], [3, 1066, 1120], [3, 1542, 1546], [3, 1557, 1597], [3, 1771, 1780], [3, 1784, 1788], [3, 1814, 1821], [3, 1827, 1851], [3, 1856, 1894], [3, 2478, 2494], [3, 2506, 2530], [3, 2564, 2575], [3, 2576, 2611], [3, 3041, 3057], [3, 3073, 3143], [3, 3782, 3844], [3, 3845, 3872], [3, 3880, 3887], [3, 3912, 3919], [3, 3919, 3920], [3, 3920, 3957], [3, 3997, 4017], [3, 4028, 4060], [3, 4149, 4184]], "underlines": [[3, 126, 194], [3, 196, 256], [3, 441, 557], [3, 559, 695], [3, 714, 728], [3, 729, 748], [3, 750, 761], [3, 762, 792], [3, 793, 811], [3, 812, 853], [3, 854, 866], [3, 867, 875], [3, 877, 881], [3, 887, 908], [3, 909, 916], [3, 961, 972], [3, 973, 998], [3, 1007, 1018], [3, 1019, 1028], [3, 1029, 1036], [3, 1037, 1045], [3, 1046, 1065], [3, 1066, 1120], [3, 1149, 1156], [3, 1161, 1169], [3, 1170, 1184], [3, 1185, 1187], [3, 1198, 1214], [3, 1215, 1225], [3, 1226, 1241], [3, 1242, 1263], [3, 1542, 1546], [3, 1547, 1556], [3, 1557, 1597], [3, 1599, 1620], [3, 1621, 1655], [3, 1656, 1680], [3, 1682, 1686], [3, 1699, 1711], [3, 1760, 1770], [3, 1771, 1780], [3, 1781, 1783], [3, 1784, 1788], [3, 1789, 1813], [3, 1814, 1821], [3, 1822, 1826], [3, 1827, 1851], [3, 1852, 1855], [3, 1856, 1894], [3, 1972, 1983], [3, 1984, 1997], [3, 1998, 2046], [3, 2078, 2259], [3, 2279, 2396], [3, 2478, 2494], [3, 2494, 2505], [3, 2506, 2530], [3, 2531, 2564], [3, 2564, 2575], [3, 2576, 2611], [3, 2626, 2645], [3, 2646, 2673], [3, 2688, 2716], [3, 2734, 2819], [3, 2820, 2829], [3, 2852, 2941], [3, 3041, 3057], [3, 3058, 3072], [3, 3073, 3143], [3, 3145, 3308], [3, 3309, 3360], [3, 3782, 3844], [3, 3845, 3872], [3, 3873, 3879], [3, 3880, 3887], [3, 3912, 3919], [3, 3920, 3957], [3, 3964, 3995], [3, 3997, 4017], [3, 4017, 4018], [3, 4028, 4060], [3, 4061, 4141], [3, 4149, 4184], [3, 4206, 4245], [3, 4246, 4264]], "emphasis": [[3, 729, 748], [3, 812, 853], [3, 854, 866], [3, 867, 875], [3, 1037, 1045], [3, 1046, 1065], [3, 1066, 1120], [3, 1242, 1263], [3, 1557, 1597], [3, 1656, 1680], [3, 1814, 1821], [3, 1822, 1826], [3, 1827, 1851], [3, 1852, 1855], [3, 1856, 1894], [3, 2576, 2611], [3, 2820, 2829], [3, 3309, 3360], [3, 3845, 3872], [3, 3920, 3957], [3, 4149, 4184], [3, 4246, 4264]], "cite_emphasis": [[7, 14], [46, 49]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2019-01-01"}, {"tag": "Tracing the world-making power of self-determination builds solidarity in the face of environmental injustice, global hierarchy, and exploitation.", "cite": "Ali MEGHJI Lecturer @ Cambridge \u201920 \u201cWhat can the sociology of race learn from the histories of anti-colonialism?\u201d Ethnicities Online First p.

In other words, Getachew recasts anticolonial nationalism itself as a transnational process, seeking an equitable remaking of the world to overcome the injustices of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Getachew\u2019s (2019: 5) book thus signals a gestalt shift in the way that she envisages anticolonial nationalism not as \u2018marking the collapse of internationalism and the closure of alternative conceptions of a world after empire\u2019, but instead as a direct, transnational confrontation to \u2018the legacies of imperial hierarchy with a demand for the radical reconstitution of the international order\u2019.", "Through focusing explicitly on Nnamdi Azikiwe, W.E.B. Du Bois, Michael Manley, Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, George Padmore, and Eric Williams, Getachew focuses on three forms of anticolonial worldmaking. Firstly, Getachew explores the anticolonial demand for the right to selfdetermination. Central to Getachew\u2019s (2019: 75) argument is that anticolonial nationalists did not simply \u2018take up\u2019 the West\u2019s discourse of self-determination and use it to secure their own independence, but \u2013 similarly to how Gopal (2019) looks at anticolonial iterations of liberty, freedom, and justice \u2013 through an \u2018anticolonial appropriation\u2019 such nationalists radically reconceptualised the meaning of self-determination. Thus, as it was first articulated by the League of Nations, self-determination involved \u2018the consent of the governed and consultation with subject people\u2019; however, this definition still allowed for colonialism given that \u2018racially backwards people\u2019 were said to not yet be capable of self-governance (Getachew, 2019: 42). Years after the League of Nations, the United Nations (UN) Charter of 1945 again evoked \u2018human rights and equality of nations [. . .] as founding principles of a new world order\u2019 despite the continuity of colonial rule (Getachew, 2019: 71). By contrast, anticolonial radicals \u2013 through forming organisations and conferences such as the League against Imperialism, and the Pan-African Congresses \u2013 directly highlighted the hypocrisy of the Westernized definition of self-determination. For instance, Nkrumah and Padmore organised the fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester, 1945, where the epistemic roots were planted for self-determination to be reconceptualised as a universalist issue of human rights. Through showing how colonialism itself was a violation of human rights, the work of anticolonial nationalists radically shifted the discourse of selfdetermination such that by 1960, when Nkrumah spoke to the UN as the president of Ghana, he was able to use the principle of self-determination to show how colonialism was directly against the UN\u2019s principles, thus leading to the Article 1514 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Peoples and Countries.", "Secondly, Getachew looks at anticolonial nationalist worldmaking through focusing on the formation of regional federations. As Getachew (2019: 113) shows, to such anticolonial nationalists, sovereignty granted through the right to self-determination was \u2018meaningless in the context of international hierarchy and economic dependence\u2019. This relates to Nkrumah\u2019s critique of neo-imperialism, described as \u2018the disjuncture between formal independence and de facto dependence\u2019 (Getachew, 2019: 108), whereby nation states have \u2018nominal freedom\u2019 yet remain economically dependent on the Global North and thus vulnerable to political domination through financial control. In response to this neo-imperialism, radicals like Nkrumah and Eric Williams saw federations \u2013 such as the Union of African States or the West Indian Federation \u2013 as providing the potential for economic trade and development that did not require foreign intervention and reliance on the Global North. This is why, for instance, upon Ghana becoming a republic in 1960, Nkrumah\u2019s nationalism also involved successfully advocating for a clause in the constitution that conferred on the parliament \u2018the power to provide for the surrender of the whole or any part of the sovereignty of Ghana\u2019 once a Union of African States was formed (Getachew, 2019: 107): national independence was thus connected to an embracing of anticolonial internationalism.", "Connected to such building of federations, which ultimately failed, Getachew explores the final form of anticolonial nationalist worldmaking: the demand for a New International Economic Order (NIEO). Getachew thus shows how \u2018second wave\u2019 anticolonial nationalists, such as Michael Manley and Julius Nyerere, developed Nkrumah\u2019s critique of neo-imperialism to show how formerly colonized nations were still vulnerable and exploited in an unequal global political economy \u2013 if not by other nations, then by private corporations. This meant that not only were the newly independent nations unequally integrated into the world economic system, but that their efforts of state building were also much more susceptible to the fluctuations of the international markets and private, corporate interests. Thus emerged the demands for a New International Economic Order (NIEO). The Declaration for the Establishment of an NIEO, put to the UN in 1974, challenged the way that the UN\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 where each member has one vote \u2013 has the power to issue legally binding international economic policy. Anticolonial nationalists, such as Nyerere, pointed out that such formal, legislative equality that was granted to formerly colonized nations was not translated into a substantive equality \u2013 as Getachew (2019: 93) summaries: \u2018to say that Jamaica or Tanzania and the United States were equal members of the international order obfuscated the outsized economic dominance that the United States exercised and could deploy to compel dependent states\u2019. Thus, Nyerere argued that an NIEO was needed such that newly independent states could have the freedom to pursue their own economic programmes, including the ability to nationalize industries under private control. To such nationalists, this NIEO was in fact a necessary prerequisite to achieve the UN\u2019s founding principle for international order: that of sovereign equality. In other words, anticolonial radicals used the principle of national sovereignty, and economic control over one\u2019s own nation, again as a process through which we could achieve an anti-imperial world order.", "At the heart of Getachew\u2019s (2019: 2) book, therefore, is the principle that \u2018decolonization was a project of reordering the world that sought to create a domination free and egalitarian international order\u2019. Anticolonial nationalism, read through this lens, despite evoking principles of self-determination and national sovereignty, was always concerned with the grander transnational project of remaking the world in an equitable fashion.", "Stretching the sociology of race across time and space", "While my review of these three books\u2019 arguments is fairly brief, I hope it is already apparent that despite making discrete arguments and contributions, they each share some fundamental similarities. Throughout the books, we see recurrent figures mentioned \u2013 from Du Bois, Padmore and Nkrumah, through to Gandhi, Churchill, and Woodrow Wilson \u2013 as well as analysis of key institutions and conferences \u2013 from the Gadar Party, based on the West Coast of the United States campaigning for Indian anti-colonialism, through to the League against Imperialism and the Pan-African Congresses. I want to now develop this review by focusing on three particular ways that these three books\u2019 transnational and historical scopes push forward the sociology of race.", "Racism at home, imperialism abroad", "Firstly, each of these three books makes the point that there is an inherent connection between racism \u2018at home\u2019 in the West, with Western practices of colonialism, imperialism, and neo-colonialism \u2018abroad\u2019. Desai\u2019s (2020) discussion, for instance, interrogates how Du Bois saw racialised capitalism as the binding factor between the United States\u2019 exploitation of Black Americans with the British empire\u2019s colonial apparatus, and how \u2018whiteness\u2019 offered a symbolic space of purity \u2013 a material and psychological wage \u2013 that impeded the white workers across the West to endorse an anti-imperialism. In his critique of racial capitalism, therefore, Du Bois argues that \u2018the English working classes are exploiting India [. . .] and the working classes of America are subjugating Santo Domingo and Haiti [. . .] He is a co-worker in the miserable modern subjugation of over half the world\u2019 (quoted in Desai 2020: 144). Similarly, Gopal (2019: 284) questions: \u2018How could the problem of race in the context of global imperialism be addressed in its specificity and as it intersected with the question of class and the exploitation of labour?\u2019 In exploring this question through the lens of dissent against the British empire, Gopal (2019: 441) presents the work of anticolonial Marxists \u2013 such as C. L.R James, Padmore, and Eric Williams \u2013 each of whom stressed that \u2018if empire was to be left behind, then the buccaneering capitalism that it had propagated would also need to be replaced with a more radically egalitarian system\u2019. In advocating for a new \u2018radically egalitarian\u2019 alternative to global capitalism, these radicals sought to not just free those newly independent nations from the Global North\u2019s economic control, but also those \u2018postcolonial citizens\u2019 exploited in the metropoles itself. Lastly, Getachew (2019: 20\u201321) discusses the notion of a \u2018global Jim Crow\u2019, highlighting how rather than being an idiosyncrasy of the US South, \u2018the color line was an international phenomenon of which segregation and racial domination in the United States were only a domestic iteration\u2019.", "Indeed, it may seem almost too obvious of a point to make that racism is connected to the processes of colonialism and neo-colonialism. After all, \u2018the concept of race was thus the glue that stuck the colonial world order together, as it became common-sense knowledge that there was a global racial hierarchy which permitted the colonization of the \u201clesser\u201d races by the dominant white Europeans\u2019 (Meghji, 2020a: 4). Nevertheless, if we look at dominant approaches in the sociology of race, then such transnational connections tend to be elided. Instead, much sociology of race tends to be characterised by a methodological nationalism in which it becomes sociologically viable \u2013 and advisable \u2013 to study racism within the confines of particular, discrete nation states (Meghji, Forthcoming). However, such methodological nationalism is not analytically useful for our current predicaments. It is the same social system that exploits the labour of children in China to make electronic goods, that exploits the (disproportionately Black and Brown) zero-hour contracted truck driver who delivers this product to its eventual owner in the West; it is the same imperialised-racialised principle that Islam is opposed to modernity that justifies the state surveillance of Muslims under the Patriot Act in the United States and the Prevent counter-terrorism programme in Britain, that justifies Western military intervention in the Middle East under the guise of civilizing the backwards world. While neither Getachew, Desai, or Gopal\u2019s books are explicitly about the links between racism and imperialism, they each highlight that there is a radical tradition of thought which has always analysed these two processes in tandem with one another. The fact that this tradition already exists pushes me to my next point, as I argue that the sociology of race needs to adopt a more historical approach.", "Looking backwards to move forwards", "While each of the three reviewed books use historical methods, each of them also reflects on our present conjunctures. Getachew (2019: 181) points out that the \u2018worldmakers of decolonization\u2019 offer an intellectual tradition through which to think about contemporary transnational movements such as \u2018the Movement for Black Lives, the Caribbean demand for reparations for slavery and genocide, and South African calls for a social and economic decolonization\u2019. Similarly, Gopal (2019: 448) argues the dispelling the myth of British colonial benevolence, and centering anticolonial agency, allows us to both move beyond the idea that Britain is a global superpower that has the legitimacy to intervene across the globe, as well as allowing \u2018Britons to lay claim to a different, more challenging history [. . .] which can draw on multiple historical and cultural resources\u2019. Lastly, Desai (2020) argues that his book highlights historical themes that still shape the present day, such as the United States\u2019 claim of being the champion of liberalism and democracy while it still routinely kills many of its citizens (and those around the world).", "In short, therefore, each of the three authors stress the necessity of having a historical sensibility to comprehend current situations and social processes. At the very same time as they are developing such temporal linkages, however, we are seeing increased attempts within the sociology of race to bifurcate the study of racism away from its historical roots in colonialism (and consequently, its contemporary basis in neo-colonialism). If we take critical race theory, for instance, Bonilla-Silva (2015: 74) even goes as far as to say that this paradigm ought to move beyond \u2018the sins [of the] past (e.g., slavery, colonization, and genocide)\u2019 in studying the \u2018contemporary foundation\u2019 of racism. Of course, Bonilla-Silva has apt reasons for his methodological scope \u2013 by reducing racism to being a consequence of past events, we lose sight of how racism continues because it still benefits people in the present day, who consequently maintain an interest in reproducing it. Nevertheless, we have to question whether being captured in a methodological \u2018presentism\u2019, which explicitly attempts to bifurcate the study of the present from its past, is analytically viable when it comes to the processes of racialisation and racism.", "Very often, for instance, what we immediately think of as a social process specific to our present racialised social structure in fact has a much longer history informed by the logics of coloniality. For instance, consider the case of the militarisation of the police in the United States \u2013 a key issue in contemporary racism. As Go (2020) shows, such militarisation of the United States\u2019 police started in the early 20th century primarily as a means of punitively surveying and controlling the racially subdominant. However, the tactics used by this police \u2013 such as the creation of mobile squads and intelligence divisions \u2013 derived from the United States\u2019 military practices in their colonies (Go, 2020). In this regard, Go creates a temporal link between a contemporary issue of police militarisation with its historical origins, and also a transnational link between \u2018racism at home\u2019 with the US\u2019 \u2018imperialism abroad\u2019 in a way that transcends bifurcated understandings of racialized processes.", "Without necessarily having it as their primary focus, therefore, Getachew, Gopal, and Desai each show the possibilities for social analysis that can be opened up if we retain a historical focus when looking at contemporary society. Through appreciating the historical linkages with contemporary racism, we become better placed to connect with the various intellectual paradigms which dedicated themselves to dismantling this system in the fight for social justice. It is this theme of social justice that we now turn to.", "Towards anti-racist, anti-colonial solidarities", "A recurrent theme runs through each of the reviewed books: the importance of forging transnational solidarities. Gopal (2019) shows how anticolonial radicals in Britain centred solidarity \u2013 in the sense of multicultural, transnational, crossorganisational coalitions \u2013 in their struggles against the British empire, meaning that thinkers in the metropoles, such as Frederic Harrison and Arthur Ballard, came to argue that the British ruling class\u2019 fascism in the colonies, in the name of capital accumulation, could be connected with their exploitation of white British workers. Similarly, Desai\u2019s (2020: 45) concept of \u2018transnational refraction\u2019 was built around the premise that anti-imperialists thought about colonialism and racism through the sense of shared struggle and solidarity, citing, for instance Saint Nihal Singh\u2019s argument that there was a fundamental \u2018link between the Asian migrant laborer [in the United States], the African American subject, and the colonized Indian, each connected the other by the sheer fact of being on the wrong side of the color line\u2019. Desai (2020: 199) even concludes his book with the assertion that such transnational refraction is a prerequisite for solidarity, when he comments that: \u2018solidarity emerges only out of a wilful act of seeing through the eyes of another, whose life we can only understand in glimpses\u2019. Lastly, Getachew (2019: 145) too notes that anticolonial nationalists \u2018fashioned Third World solidarity as a form of international class politics, and demanded redistribution on the basis that postcolonial states had in fact produced the wealth the West enjoyed\u2019.", "Each of these authors focuses on transnational, multicultural, multiorganisational forms of solidarity not because it is historically interesting, but because history has shown us that these forms of solidarity are successful and necessary in the struggles for social justice. I make this point not because the sociology of race is wilfully ignoring the importance of such solidarity, but because the issues of racism facing us in the contemporary and future world need to replicate these forms of solidarity fostered by the anticolonial radicals recounted in these three books. When we think of the climate crisis, for instance, a solidarity needs to be forged between the poor workers across the West (many of whom areracialised as Black and Brown) who are disproportionately exposed to air pollution, with the environmental destruction faced by indigenous people across Latin America, Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in the name of capital accumulation, who also in turn need to form a solidarity with those in South Asia facing starvation due to droughts, who in turn need to form solidarities with those in the Caribbean, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, where cyclones and hurricanes have been creating humanitarian crises. When we think of Islamophobia, we need to form a solidarity between those campaigning against the punitive surveillance of, and state violence towards, Muslims in the West, with those campaigning against the Uyghur detention camps in China, and the Hindutva violence towards Muslims in Kashmir. When it comes to race and racism, we are always talking about transnational, historically, epistemically, and spatially connected social processes, and \u2013 as Getachew rightfully highlights \u2013 \u2018worldmaking\u2019 processes of inequality require equally global solidarities and projects of resistance.", ""], "id": "0f299d0e72919f584cd5b6da04d155052a71c15d427cb99f9bb182d40dda7ac5", "highlighted_text": " we ought to see anticolonial nationalism as an exercise in \u2018worldmaking \u2019 epistemic roots were planted for self-determination to be reconceptualised as a issue of human rights nationalism was always concerned with the grander transnational project of remaking the world in an equitable fashion worldmakers offer an intellectual tradition through which to think about the Movement for Black Lives bean demand for reparations and South African calls for decolonization\u2019 anti-imperialists thought about colonialism and racism through shared struggle and solidarity solidarity emerges only out of seeing through the eyes of another these forms are successful and necessary in struggles for social justice solidarity needs to be forged between poor workers across the West with the environmental destruction across Latin America, Canada Australia, and New Zealand in capital accumulation who need to form solidarities with the Caribbean, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, where cyclones have been creating humanitarian crises worldmaking\u2019 require global solidarities and projects of resistance", "highlights": [[3, 152, 192], [3, 200, 230], [3, 230, 231], [4, 1620, 1699], [4, 1713, 1734], [7, 221, 232], [7, 333, 438], [14, 161, 172], [14, 192, 252], [14, 299, 327], [14, 338, 365], [14, 392, 419], [14, 442, 457], [19, 681, 743], [19, 757, 787], [19, 1232, 1262], [19, 1279, 1313], [20, 185, 196], [20, 211, 214], [20, 215, 242], [20, 247, 275], [20, 632, 669], [20, 674, 702], [20, 804, 838], [20, 866, 894], [20, 915, 944], [20, 957, 977], [20, 1082, 1085], [20, 1094, 1124], [20, 1134, 1189], [20, 1205, 1243], [20, 1731, 1743], [20, 1768, 1775], [20, 1784, 1830]], "underlines": [[3, 152, 192], [3, 193, 199], [3, 200, 230], [3, 249, 324], [4, 343, 436], [4, 1617, 1619], [4, 1620, 1699], [4, 1700, 1712], [4, 1713, 1734], [4, 1756, 1806], [7, 221, 232], [7, 234, 332], [7, 333, 438], [7, 438, 439], [14, 156, 161], [14, 161, 172], [14, 173, 191], [14, 192, 252], [14, 253, 299], [14, 299, 327], [14, 327, 338], [14, 338, 365], [14, 366, 391], [14, 392, 419], [14, 420, 441], [14, 442, 457], [14, 457, 458], [15, 21, 25], [15, 47, 156], [19, 0, 30], [19, 59, 111], [19, 590, 597], [19, 609, 680], [19, 681, 743], [19, 744, 756], [19, 757, 787], [19, 787, 795], [19, 822, 1076], [19, 1144, 1232], [19, 1232, 1262], [19, 1263, 1278], [19, 1279, 1313], [19, 1313, 1361], [19, 1371, 1379], [19, 1407, 1625], [20, 159, 184], [20, 185, 196], [20, 197, 210], [20, 211, 214], [20, 215, 242], [20, 243, 246], [20, 247, 275], [20, 389, 546], [20, 579, 614], [20, 630, 631], [20, 632, 669], [20, 670, 673], [20, 674, 702], [20, 703, 803], [20, 804, 838], [20, 839, 865], [20, 866, 894], [20, 894, 914], [20, 915, 944], [20, 945, 956], [20, 957, 977], [20, 977, 1081], [20, 1082, 1085], [20, 1086, 1093], [20, 1094, 1124], [20, 1125, 1133], [20, 1134, 1189], [20, 1190, 1204], [20, 1205, 1243], [20, 1243, 1539], [20, 1731, 1743], [20, 1744, 1767], [20, 1768, 1775], [20, 1776, 1783], [20, 1784, 1830]], "emphasis": [[20, 215, 242], [20, 243, 246], [20, 247, 275], [20, 1731, 1743], [20, 1744, 1767], [20, 1768, 1775], [20, 1776, 1783], [20, 1784, 1830]], "cite_emphasis": [[4, 10], [32, 35]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-07-13"}, {"tag": "Our alternative \u2013 We should adopt the principle of sovereignty as non-domination.

Against the backdrop of self-determination\u2019s fall, political theorists and philosophers reframed their questions about justice and legitimacy from a global perspective. Historically, these disciplines viewed the domestic sphere and particularly the \u201csovereign state as the consummation of political experience and activity\u201d and thus limited normative theorizing to questions of domestic politics.68 However, beginning in the 1970s and in a more sustained fashion after the end of the Cold War, the global turn in political theory questioned this disaggregation of the domestic and international and subjected the international to normative theorizing. Fueling this body of work was a confrontation with the nation-state\u2019s empirical and normative limits. On the one hand, the stylized self-sufficient state, which served as the backdrop for John Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice, appeared entirely out of sync with the growing interdependence wrought by economic globalization. In his early critique of Rawls\u2019s assumptions about self-sufficient states, Charles Beitz drew on the growing role of multinational corporations and transnational capital flows to argue that \u201cinternational economic cooperation creates a new basis for international morality.\u201d69 For Beitz and the field of global justice that emerged in the wake of this intervention, this account of economic globalization made it possible to theorize redistributive obligations beyond the state.", "By the end of the Cold War, the growing layers of international legal, political, and economic interdependence also opened up new possibilities for rethinking the political institutions of the international order. In this context, a \u201cfortress-like conception of state sovereignty,\u201d which historically gave states a monopoly on internal political and economic decision-making, was giving way to international institutions and particularly international human rights law that sought to limit and tame state action.70 According to Habermas, these developments signaled a growing transformation of \u201cinternational law as a law of states into cosmopolitan law as a law of individuals.\u201d71 In this context, Habermas and others have examined the prospects for a constitutionalization of international law that does not aim at the formation of a world state, but disaggregates sovereignty such that the limited functions of securing peace and protecting human rights are lodged in a supranational institution while intermediary and regional institutions address arenas of growing interdependence such as economic and environmental policy.72", "While the field of cosmopolitan political theory includes debates that range from global distributional justice to the constitutionalization of regional and international organizations, a central assumption of this perspective is that we now occupy a post-Westphalian world order. On this view, an international order governed by the principles of state sovereignty, equality, and nonintervention can be dated to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia and was progressively expanded and extended in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As noted above, decolonization is often viewed as the culmination of this process. At the same time, this moment of its universalization is said to coincide with economic and political transformations that chipped away at the normative model of the \u201cself-determining sovereign national state.\u201d73 Thus, while decolonization made the Westphalian model universal, it quickly became \u201can anachronism.\u201d74", "This invocation of \u201cWestphalian sovereignty\u201d is often taken to be a conceptual construct rather than a lived reality. But even when this is acknowledged, the division of Westphalian and post-Westphalian elides the continuities between our international past and present by obscuring the ways in which empire was and continues to be constitutive of international society. An expansive view of empire as a practice and structure of unequal integration rather than simply alien rule highlights the deep continuities between the Westphalian and post-Westphalian world orders. For instance, far from being unprecedented, contemporary economic globalization should be situated within a long history of an imperial global economy. The \u201cdensity, the speed, and the impact of the global flows\u201d that emerged from the first colonial encounters in the Americas were already planetary in the fifteenth century and restructured political and economic relations within and beyond the Atlantic world.75 This economic integration often took the form of a \u201cnon-colonial imperialism\u201d that secured economic access and domination through indirect forms of coercion.76 Contemporary conditions\u2014such as the outsized power of private corporations, the role of international institutions in ensuring the unfettered movement of capital, and the inequalities this era of globalization has generated\u2014build on these imperial foundations and reproduce the logics of unequal integration.", "And as was the case prior to decolonization, relations of economic dependence and inequality are often coupled with legal and political modes of unequal membership in international society. While decolonization is associated with the extension of formal rights to all states, legal handicaps written into the process of decolonization set limits on the sovereignty of postcolonial states.77 Thus, even at the moment associated with the culmination of Westphalian sovereignty, juridical equality was aspirational rather than fully realized. More recently, international lawyers and scholars of international relations have abandoned even the normative and aspirational commitment to sovereign equality, arguing for a return to modes of conditional and limited membership for states deemed outlaws, failed, or rogue.78 The explicit defense of a hierarchically organized international order coincides with the growing power of institutions like the UN Security Council and the unilateralism of the United States.79 Rather than view the international order through the dichotomy of Westphalian and post-Westphalian, we should understand it as an imperial world order that was challenged by projects of anticolonial worldmaking and was reconstituted.", "The persistence of unequal integration and hierarchy calls for a postcolonial cosmopolitanism that recenters the problem of empire. Drawing on the critique of international hierarchy and the anticolonial efforts to build a world after empire, which are reconstructed in the following pages, this model of cosmopolitanism is less aimed at the limits of the nation-state and more concerned with the ways that relations of hierarchy continue to create differentiated modes of sovereignty and reproduce domination in the international sphere. As described above, hierarchy designates not hegemony, but processes of integration and interaction that produce unevenly distributed rights, obligations, and burdens. These processes of unequal integration are structural and embedded in the institutional arrangements of the international order. They create the international conditions of ongoing imperial domination.", "With its critical and diagnostic orientation focused on the present configurations of international hierarchy, the normative and utopian core of a postcolonial cosmopolitanism remains the principle of nondomination at the center of anticolonial worldmaking.80 Nondomination recasts the current configurations of international hierarchy as infringements on collective projects of self-government. This approach contrasts with an account of the injustices of the international sphere that is primarily concerned with the violation of individual human rights. While international human rights protections have provided important resources in challenging international hierarchy and can be combined with collective claims for self-government, on their own they offer a limited account of the wrongs involved.81 For instance, the expansive claims of private corporations not only undermine individual human rights but also threaten the capacity of self-government insofar as corporate prerogatives erode guarantees secured through state constitutions and national legislation. An emphasis on nondomination thus broadens our account of the injustices that unequal integration and international hierarchy engender. Moreover, as the examples of anticolonial worldmaking suggest, realizing the international condition of nondomination necessary to self-government can extend beyond a defense of the state to include more demanding internationalisms.", "In this dual focus on hierarchy and nondomination, a postcolonial cosmopolitanism offers a more circumspect approach to the antistatist orientation of the cosmopolitan turn in political theory. In championing the equal moral worth of persons against the morally arbitrary nature of nation-states, cosmopolitan theorists have advocated taming the state through international law and have expanded the reach of our political and moral obligations. However, this privileging and prioritization of the moral worth of individuals coincides with the normative diminution of collective claims to sovereignty and self-determination, which have historically served to restrain imperialism. As Jean Cohen has argued, in \u201cprematurely drop[ping] the concept of sovereignty\u201d and \u201cassum[ing] that a constitutional cosmopolitan legal order already exists which has or should replace international law,\u201d cosmopolitans risk \u201cbecoming apologists for neo-imperial projects.\u201d82 Viewing sovereignty as primarily an impediment to securing the rights of individuals provides cover for imperial practices cynically masked as humanitarian efforts and leaves insufficient normative resources to distinguish and critique imperial and hierarchical curtailments of sovereignty.", "This is not an argument for retreating into a defensive sovereigntist position, which cannot provide adequate critical and normative resources to address the contemporary dilemmas of the international order, and it should be clear that the postcolonial approach outlined here does not offer an exhaustive theory of the international order.

In the thirty years between my grandparents moving in with their three babies and me being born, Englewood had gone from being a (mostly) middle-income community, close-knit and quiet, to one of the poorest, most barren parts of the city. My neighborhood had so many problems: poverty, unemployment, underfunded schools, police brutality, pollution, violence. And those were just the big ones. I rarely saw anyone in power try to solve the problems in Englewood. And when they did try, it seemed to make things worse.", "When I asked my mom and grandma why Englewood looked like this, they didn\u2019t tell me about guns or drugs or gangs.

This is, of course, not how most people think of public policy. In fact, most \u201cofficial\u201d definitions of policy say something like this:", "Policy [is] a statement by government\u2014at whatever level, in whatever form\u2014of what it intends to do about a public problem. Such statements can be found in the Constitution, statutes, regulation, case law (that is, court decisions), agency or leadership decisions, or even in changes of the behavior of government officials at all levels. For example, a law that says that those caught driving while intoxicated will go to jail for up to one year is a statement of governmental policy to punish drunk drivers. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a statement of government policy toward the environment\u2026.", "And: \u201cPolicy is what the government chooses to do or not to do\u201d about a public problem.", "This is all true. But definitions like this make policy design sound like it\u2019s orderly and contained\u2014much like going to the doctor. You have a problem; the doctor diagnoses it; you two find the best treatment. Creating policy is more like going to the doctor with a problem, having fifteen people argue about if it\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d problem that requires a doctor to begin with, then having five of those people (plus some new strangers!) start arguing anew about what the cause of the problem is, only to be interrupted by the doctor\u2019s boss coming in to tell them that they can only choose two of five possible treatment options because the other three would hurt the hospital\u2019s bottom line. And once treatment begins, people argue over how to determine whether it\u2019s successful and if it should be reversed to save money or time.", "Policymaking is not a science. It is a fight over whose problems get addressed, how those problems are addressed, and how public power and resources are distributed. If politics is a fight to elect people who reflect and share our values, policy is a fight to actually enact those values\u2014to mold the world, through the work of government, into what we think it should be.", "That is why, contrary to popular belief, the most important part of a policy proposal is not the details\u2014at least at the beginning. It\u2019s the vision that the policy presents. As a statement about what the government is going to do, policy inherently tells a story about what went wrong, how the government can fix it, and who has power to shape society\u2014whether it\u2019s the state or the public or corporations. The best policies tell compelling stories, galvanizing legislators and citizens to fight for them, and provide public servants with a clear purpose when they sit down to implement the details. The stories may shift as opponents pick new battles; the details may need tweaks or overhauls as unexpected challenges emerge. A coherent policy vision provides the foundation that both the stories and the details draw upon. Three pillars\u2014the problem, principles, and power\u2014form that foundation, and anchor policymaking from conception to execution.", "Problems are the center of any public policy. Because policy is the government\u2019s response to a problem, policy can only be created if we agree that an issue constitutes not just a problem but a public problem\u2014that is, a problem that affects the public that cannot be solved without the government. How we define the scope and origin of the problem determines how we\u2019ll craft a solution. That\u2019s why fossil fuel companies spend millions to sow doubts about the urgency of the climate crisis and cover up their culpability. It\u2019s not just about saving face; it\u2019s about changing our understanding of the problem and preventing government action.", "Principles. Policymakers need a compass to navigate the near-infinite variety of policy designs, and principles\u2014 which include both our moral values and our theories of government\u2014provide that compass. Remember, policymaking is collective problem-solving\u2014not an objective \u201cscience.\u201d Policymaking, like all decision-making, is guided not only by facts but by our values\u2014about freedom and justice, about what we deserve, about what \u201cother people\u201d deserve and, perhaps most crucially, about what the government should and should not do. Principles are, in short, the moral and intellectual core of a policy. They define not only how we engage with a problem but what solutions we consider at all.", "Problems in our society are rooted in power. Asking why a problem remains unresolved leads to questions of power: Who wields it and to what end? Are the powerful negligent or malevolent? By directing and entrenching flows of government resources and attention, policy always shapes the distribution of power. Effective, lasting policy changes must change the distributions of power that led to the problem initially, or else the old malefactors will undermine any success. When selecting the mechanisms a policy will use (a loan; a new legal protection; a direct public investment; a new federal agency), policymakers are deciding how to maintain or disrupt the balance of power. And this is not limited to power in the public sector. Governments write the laws, enforce the contracts, and build the infrastructure that make a society and economy possible. Policy changes reverberate beyond the public sector into every domain of our lives.", "Problems, principles, and power are the pillars of any policy vision. Together, they animate the policymaking process, guiding not just the story policymakers tell but the decisions they make about what should (or should not) be included in a given proposal.", "IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL A POLICY?", "The Green New Deal is a proposal for a ten-year economic mobilization to rapidly transition the US to a zero-carbon economy and, in so doing so, regenerate and reorganize the US economy in ways that significantly reduce inequality and redress legacies of systemic oppression. The congressional Green New Deal (\u201cGND\u201d) resolution has five goals:", "1. Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.", "2. Create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.", "3. Invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.", "4. Secure clean air and water, climate and community resilience, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment for all.", "5. Promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities, including Indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, lowincome workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.", "The GND resolution proposes to achieve these goals in two ways. The first is through a set of \u201cprojects\u201d that, if completed, would nearly eliminate carbon emissions in the US. The second is through a set of policies that aim to protect Americans from the disruption and instability that transitioning away from fossil fuels will create and reduce inequity. Some people like to refer to the first set of projects as the \u201cGreen\u201d part of the GND and the second as the \u201cNew Deal\u201d part. While this may be a helpful rhetorical device, it is a dangerous way to conceptualize the GND. All parts of the GND advance decarbonization\u2014even the \u201cnon-climate\u201d policies like universal health care, education, and job training. Similarly, the \u201cgreen\u201d projects can help reduce inequity if they are designed to create millions of wellpaying jobs, bolster worker power, invest in local communities, and strengthen the social safety net\u2014all of which the Green New Deal proposes to do. Addressing decarbonization and inequality simultaneously has prompted critics to accuse the GND of being a \u201cprogressive wish list,\u201d not a policy. Their criticism often reveals a narrow policy vision guiding their thinking. The problem is simply the carbon in the atmosphere; Mr. Policy Doctor will prescribe the correct solution based on science; imbalances of power are mostly irrelevant, too difficult to disrupt when an urgent crisis needs solving. This is a compelling story. But it cannot guide policymakers tasked with averting catastrophic warming, as many authors in this book show.", "The Green New Deal is a new policy vision\u2014one that will guide government and society through the biggest task in modern history: decarbonizing our global economy within the next ten to twenty years. The stories and details of GND policy will undoubtedly change in the coming years, but they will be anchored by the vision\u2014a conception of the problem, a set of principles, and an analysis of power\u2014that the GND provides. Vision, however, is not enough.

If the shutting down of the global economy during the first 4\u2009months of COVID-19 led to an 8\u2009percent annual decrease in carbon emissions, and this decrease is required yearly for the next 10\u2009years, nothing short of coordinated national and international action can be effective. As the logic behind the CoP15 Paris Agreement understood, in a world structured by a system of states, the state remains, in relation with other states, the effective focus for these national and international acts of coordination. One can maintain, of course, that concerted reflection on goals and their practice cannot be rehearsed within the same state system that, in co-evolution with capitalism, has produced the climate problem in the first place.24 Yet, my argument here is simple: (1) climate action must be of a political kind if this action is to be coherent and effective, and the horizon of this understanding of the political (comprehensive and effective action) is in a vital sense defined by the state; (2) this political action redounds above all to the agency and responsibility of the state both in relation to its own citizenry and in relation to other states and their citizenry. In response to the challenge of time and scale, I argue we should turn to, not turn away from, the state as an agent of change. Only if one renounces the potential of political action today through historically constituted practices of political efficacy does one shun this kind of conclusion. In which case, I would argue, one has renounced politics for our age, as well as the major emotion on which politics is based, hope.25 Since Max Weber, the state is sociologically defined by the legitimate monopoly of violence that it holds over all other forms of force within a nationally determined territory.26 There are many ways in which this monopoly is contested today. The description of a state as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 is nothing but the indication that a particular state does not hold the monopoly of violence within its territory. Prior to questions of political authority and legitimacy, all states are today vulnerable in this sense given the nature of global challenges that follow intended and unintended processes of interdependence (global financial instability, global terrorism, migration flows, pandemics, climate change, etc.). That said, the responses both to the financial crisis of 2008 and (much more so) to the present COVID-19 crisis testify to the fact that the monopoly of violence particular to the effectiveness of state governance remains in place. Among an increasing complexity of social actors, the state still holds the levers of power that are decisive in effecting social transformation. Consequently, to one side of the empirical fact that countries constitute the beef of the UNFCCC climate regime, I am arguing that the state remains the primary vehicle of a politics of climate change. As the emerging literature on the Green New Deal implies, the state can do the following. At a national level, it can organize and steer fiscal, monetary and sector-policies like those of energy, transport, agriculture, the communications industry and housing in such a way that both businesses and consumers are motivated to shift behaviour towards a carbon-neutral society. This model of the state is one of a regulated market economy that uses the coordination of state direction with market dynamism to effect broad social change. Governments respond to markets as they plan ahead with regard to climate change (the rapid fall in the price of solar and wind energy, for example), and much of the new green infrastructure is/will be locally distributed and assembled (no \u2018giant public works\u2019 given that contemporary technology is smart).27 That said, governments are the sole governance body with appropriate fiscal and monetary tools (1) to set up the rebuilding of national economies with new strategic priorities; (2) to steer and to guarantee concerted action across sectors; and (3) to guarantee, in turn, that this action is underpinned by the principles of \u2018a just transition\u2019.28 If the timeline to a 50\u2009percent reduction of carbon emissions is 2030, then the state must so organize and steer that solutions to climate change are integrated. Attention to \u2018the climate emergency\u2019 alone will not lead to the necessary change. This last point is important and suggests why the idea of the Green New Deal, whether one is on the Left or Right, harbours the appropriate response. The integration of climate policy with radical policies for poverty alleviation and re-employment in sustainable industries and commerce provides the only way in which the shift from an extractive to a regenerative economy and society is possible in the first place. Without this convergence of solutions, practical solutions to climate change will not only tackle the scale and timeline of the problem; they will re-create a deeply divided polity of the employed and unemployed that could lead to ever-worse scenarios of a politics based on division and fear, not community and hope. It is the state alone \u2013 in conjunction with the forces of the market and civil society \u2013 that can provide the vision, the terms of execution of this vision (organized integration) and, critically, the policy-leverage that can bring about economic and social convergence."], "id": "76049ea71f580b347b99f6840506e456629c89c96fa6b5615dd9e644c4edd185", "highlighted_text": " Climate action requires political acti on nothing short of coordinated national action can be effective . the state remains the focus we should turn to, not turn away from , the state the state holds the levers of power Green New Deal can steer fiscal, and sector-policies in such a way that both businesses and consumers shift behaviour integration of climate policy with radical policies provides the only way in which a regenerative society is possible Without this convergence solutions will not tackle the scale and timeline they will re-create a deeply divided polity that could lead worse division and fear", "highlights": [[3, 0, 14], [3, 15, 38], [3, 38, 40], [3, 385, 422], [3, 441, 464], [3, 464, 465], [3, 569, 586], [3, 619, 622], [3, 633, 638], [3, 1424, 1461], [3, 1461, 1462], [3, 1463, 1472], [3, 2786, 2789], [3, 2790, 2795], [3, 2802, 2827], [3, 3118, 3132], [3, 3152, 3155], [3, 3215, 3228], [3, 3238, 3257], [3, 3344, 3367], [3, 3368, 3392], [3, 3410, 3425], [3, 4672, 4723], [3, 4805, 4835], [3, 4868, 4882], [3, 4895, 4914], [3, 4935, 4947], [3, 4948, 4959], [3, 4984, 4993], [3, 5012, 5020], [3, 5026, 5036], [3, 5037, 5055], [3, 5072, 5115], [3, 5147, 5162], [3, 5171, 5176], [3, 5210, 5227]], "underlines": [[3, 0, 14], [3, 15, 38], [3, 38, 40], [3, 57, 86], [3, 87, 92], [3, 93, 124], [3, 125, 129], [3, 130, 185], [3, 385, 422], [3, 423, 440], [3, 441, 464], [3, 524, 567], [3, 567, 568], [3, 569, 586], [3, 619, 622], [3, 622, 622], [3, 623, 632], [3, 633, 638], [3, 639, 697], [3, 697, 697], [3, 698, 714], [3, 772, 835], [3, 873, 901], [3, 924, 940], [3, 946, 955], [3, 961, 1106], [3, 1144, 1184], [3, 1190, 1366], [3, 1368, 1414], [3, 1424, 1461], [3, 1463, 1472], [3, 1473, 1494], [3, 2520, 2558], [3, 2567, 2570], [3, 2601, 2606], [3, 2617, 2641], [3, 2737, 2785], [3, 2786, 2789], [3, 2790, 2795], [3, 2796, 2801], [3, 2802, 2827], [3, 2828, 2880], [3, 2880, 2881], [3, 3013, 3022], [3, 3023, 3082], [3, 3084, 3086], [3, 3091, 3117], [3, 3118, 3132], [3, 3133, 3151], [3, 3152, 3155], [3, 3202, 3214], [3, 3215, 3228], [3, 3229, 3237], [3, 3238, 3257], [3, 3258, 3343], [3, 3344, 3367], [3, 3368, 3392], [3, 3393, 3409], [3, 3410, 3425], [3, 3426, 3459], [3, 3938, 3995], [3, 3996, 4021], [3, 4029, 4102], [3, 4111, 4170], [3, 4175, 4270], [3, 4436, 4483], [3, 4484, 4516], [3, 4518, 4522], [3, 4551, 4567], [3, 4580, 4594], [3, 4633, 4666], [3, 4672, 4723], [3, 4724, 4804], [3, 4805, 4835], [3, 4836, 4867], [3, 4868, 4882], [3, 4883, 4894], [3, 4895, 4914], [3, 4915, 4934], [3, 4935, 4947], [3, 4948, 4959], [3, 4960, 4972], [3, 4974, 4983], [3, 4984, 4993], [3, 4994, 5011], [3, 5012, 5020], [3, 5021, 5025], [3, 5026, 5036], [3, 5037, 5055], [3, 5056, 5070], [3, 5072, 5115], [3, 5116, 5146], [3, 5147, 5162], [3, 5163, 5165], [3, 5166, 5171], [3, 5171, 5176], [3, 5177, 5186], [3, 5187, 5209], [3, 5210, 5227], [3, 5227, 5251], [3, 5253, 5274], [3, 5342, 5408], [3, 5433, 5523]], "emphasis": [[3, 15, 38], [3, 87, 92], [3, 125, 129], [3, 385, 422], [3, 423, 440], [3, 441, 464], [3, 567, 568], [3, 569, 586], [3, 623, 632], [3, 633, 638], [3, 1424, 1461], [3, 2790, 2795], [3, 2796, 2801], [3, 2802, 2827], [3, 2828, 2880], [3, 3013, 3022], [3, 3023, 3082], [3, 3368, 3392], [3, 3410, 3425], [3, 3996, 4021], [3, 4484, 4516], [3, 4672, 4723], [3, 4724, 4804], [3, 4805, 4835], [3, 4836, 4867], [3, 4868, 4882], [3, 4883, 4894], [3, 4895, 4914], [3, 4915, 4934], [3, 4948, 4959], [3, 4960, 4972], [3, 5037, 5055], [3, 5072, 5115], [3, 5166, 5171], [3, 5171, 5176], [3, 5177, 5186], [3, 5210, 5227], [3, 5227, 5251], [3, 5253, 5274]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 20]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-01"}, {"tag": "Case", "cite": "1NC \u2013 AT: Case", "body": ["T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2, 20\u2014assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown University (Ol\u00faf\u00e9mi, \u201cBeing-in-the-Room Privilege: Elite Capture and Epistemic Deference,\u201d The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4, dml)", "I think it\u2019s less about the core ideas and more about the prevailing norms that convert them into practice. The call to \u201clisten to the most affected\u201d or \u201ccentre the most marginalized\u201d is ubiquitous in many academic and activist circles. But it\u2019s never sat well with me. In my experience, when people say they need to \u201clisten to the most affected\u201d, it isn\u2019t because they intend to set up Skype calls to refugee camps or to collaborate with houseless people. Instead, it has more often meant handing conversational authority and attentional goods to those who most snugly fit into the social categories associated with these ills \u2013 regardless of what they actually do or do not know, or what they have or have not personally experienced. In the case of my conversation with Helen, my racial category tied me more \u201cauthentically\u201d to an experience that neither of us had had. She was called to defer to me by the rules of the game as we understood it. Even where stakes are high \u2013 where potential researchers are discussing how to understand a social phenomenon, where activists are deciding what to target \u2013 these rules often prevail.", "The trap wasn\u2019t that standpoint epistemology was affecting the conversation, but how. Broadly, the norms of putting standpoint epistemology into practice call for practices of deference: giving offerings, passing the mic, believing. These are good ideas in many cases, and the norms that ask us to be ready to do them stem from admirable motivations: a desire to increase the social power of marginalized people identified as sources of knowledge and rightful targets of deferential behaviour. But deferring in this way as a rule or default political orientation can actually work counter to marginalized groups\u2019 interests, especially in elite spaces.", "Some rooms have outsize power and influence: the Situation Room, the newsroom, the bargaining table, the conference room. Being in these rooms means being in a position to affect institutions and broader social dynamics by way of deciding what one is to say and do. Access to these rooms is itself a kind of social advantage, and one often gained through some prior social advantage. From a societal standpoint, the \u201cmost affected\u201d by the social injustices we associate with politically important identities like gender, class, race, and nationality are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated, underemployed, or part of the 44 percent of the world\u2019s population without internet access \u2013 and thus both left out of the rooms of power and largely ignored by the people in the rooms of power. Individuals who make it past the various social selection pressures that filter out those social identities associated with these negative outcomes are most likely to be in the room. That is, they are most likely to be in the room precisely because of ways in which they are systematically different from (and thus potentially unrepresentative of) the very people they are then asked to represent in the room.", "I suspected that Helen\u2019s offer was a trap. She was not the one who set it, but it threatened to ensnare us both all the same. Broader cultural norms \u2013 the sort set in motion by prefacing statements with \u201cAs a Black man\u2026\u201d \u2013 cued up a set of standpoint-respecting practices that many of us know consciously or unconsciously by rote. However, the forms of deference that often follow are ultimately self-undermining and only reliably serve \u201celite capture\u201d: the control over political agendas and resources by a group\u2019s most advantaged people. If we want to use standpoint epistemology to challenge unjust power arrangements, it\u2019s hard to imagine how we could do worse.", "To say what\u2019s wrong with the popular, deferential applications of standpoint epistemology, we need to understand what makes it popular. A number of cynical answers present themselves: some (especially the more socially advantaged) don\u2019t genuinely want social change \u2013 they just want the appearance of it. Alternatively, deference to figures from oppressed communities is a performance that sanitizes, apologizes for, or simply distracts from the fact that the deferrer has enough \u201cin the room\u201d privilege for their \u201clifting up\u201d of a perspective to be of consequence.", "I suspect there is some truth to these views, but I am unsatisfied. Many of the people who support and enact these deferential norms are rather like Helen: motivated by the right reasons, but trusting people they share such rooms with to help them find the proper practical expression of their joint moral commitments. We don\u2019t need to attribute bad faith to all or even most of those who interpret standpoint epistemology deferentially to explain the phenomenon, and it\u2019s not even clear it would help. Bad \u201croommates\u201d aren\u2019t the problem for the same reason that Helen being a good roommate wasn\u2019t the solution: the problem emerges from how the rooms themselves are constructed and managed.", "To return to the initial example with Helen, the issue wasn\u2019t merely that I hadn\u2019t grown up in the kind of low-income, redlined community she was imagining. The epistemic situation was much worse than this. Many of the facts about me that made my life chances different from those of the people she was imagining were the very same facts that made me likely to be offered things on their behalf. If I had grown up in such a community, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been on the phone together.", "Many aspects of our social system serve as filtering mechanisms, determining which interactions happen and between whom, and thus which social patterns people are in a position to observe. For the majority of the 20th century, the U.S. quota system of immigration made legal immigration with a path to citizenship almost exclusively available to Europeans (earning Hitler\u2019s regard as the obvious \u201cleader in developing explicitly racist policies of nationality and immigration\u201d). But the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration possibilities, with a preference for \u201cskilled labour\u201d.", "My parents\u2019 qualification as skilled labourers does much to explain their entry into the country and the subsequent class advantages and monetary resources (such as wealth) that I was born into. We are not atypical: the Nigerian-American population is one of the country\u2019s most successful immigrant populations (what no one mentions, of course, is that the 112,000 or so Nigerian-Americans with advanced degrees is utterly dwarfed by the 82 million Nigerians who live on less than a dollar a day, or how the former fact intersects with the latter). The selectivity of immigration law helps explain the rates of educational attainment of the Nigerian diasporic community that raised me, which in turn helps explain my entry into the exclusive Advanced Placement and Honours classes in high school, which in turn helps explain my access to higher education...and so on, and so on.", "It is easy, then, to see how this deferential form of standpoint epistemology contributes to elite capture at scale. The rooms of power and influence are at the end of causal chains that have selection effects. As you get higher and higher forms of education, social experiences narrow \u2013 some students are pipelined to PhDs and others to prisons. Deferential ways of dealing with identity can inherit the distortions caused by these selection processes. ", "\u200bBut it\u2019s equally easy to see locally \u2013 in this room, in this academic literature or field, in this conversation \u2013 why this deference seems to make sense. It is often an improvement on the epistemic procedure that preceded it: the person deferred to may well be better epistemically positioned than the others in the room. It may well be the best we can do while holding fixed most of the facts about the rooms themselves: what power resides in them, who is admitted.", "But these are the last facts we should want to hold fixed. Doing better than the epistemic norms we\u2019ve inherited from a history of explicit global apartheid is an awfully low bar to set. The facts that explain who ends up in which room shape our world much more powerfully than the squabbles for comparative prestige between people who have already made it into the rooms. And when the conversation is about social justice, the mechanisms of the social system that determine who gets into which room often just are the parts of society we aim to address. For example, the fact that incarcerated people cannot participate in academic discussions about freedom that physically take place on campus is intimately related to the fact that they are locked in cages.", "Deference epistemology marks itself as a solution to an epistemic and political problem. But not only does it fail to solve these problems, it adds new ones. One might think questions of justice ought to be primarily concerned with fixing disparities around health care, working conditions, and basic material and interpersonal security. Yet conversations about justice have come to be shaped by people who have ever more specific practical advice about fixing the distribution of attention and conversational power. Deference practices that serve attention-focused campaigns (e.g. we\u2019ve read too many white men, let\u2019s now read some people of colour) can fail on their own highly questionable terms: attention to spokespeople from marginalized groups could, for example, direct attention away from the need to change the social system that marginalizes them.", "Elites from marginalized groups can benefit from this arrangement in ways that are compatible with social progress. But treating group elites\u2019 interests as necessarily or even presumptively aligned with full group interests involves a political naivet\u00e9 we cannot afford. Such treatment of elite interests functions as a racial Reaganomics: a strategy reliant on fantasies about the exchange rate between the attention economy and the material economy.", "Perhaps the lucky few who get jobs finding the most culturally authentic and cosmetically radical description of the continuing carnage are really winning one for the culture. Then, after we in the chattering class get the clout we deserve and secure the bag, its contents will eventually trickle down to the workers who clean up after our conferences, to slums of the Global South\u2019s megacities, to its countryside. ", "But probably not.", "A fuller and fairer assessment of what is going on with deference and standpoint epistemology would go beyond technical argument, and contend with the emotional appeals of this strategy of deference. Those in powerful rooms may be \u201celites\u201d relative to the larger group they represent, but this guarantees nothing about how they are treated in the rooms they are in. After all, a person privileged in an absolute sense (a person belonging to, say, the half of the world that has secure access to \u201cbasic needs\u201d) may nevertheless feel themselves to be consistently on the low end of the power dynamics they actually experience. Deference epistemology responds to real, morally weighty experiences of being put down, ignored, sidelined, or silenced. It thus has an important non-epistemic appeal to members of stigmatized or marginalized groups: it intervenes directly in morally consequential practices of giving attention and respect. ", "The social dynamics we experience have an outsize role in developing and refining our political subjectivity, and our sense of ourselves. But this very strength of standpoint epistemology \u2013 its recognition of the importance of perspective \u2013 becomes its weakness when combined with deferential practical norms. Emphasis on the ways we are marginalized often matches the world as we have experienced it. But, from a structural perspective, the rooms we never needed to enter (and the explanations of why we can avoid these rooms) might have more to teach us about the world and our place in it. If so, the deferential approach to standpoint epistemology actually prevents \u201ccentring\u201d or even hearing from the most marginalized; it focuses us on the interaction of the rooms we occupy, rather than calling us to account for the interactions we don\u2019t experience. This fact about who is in the room, combined with the fact that speaking for others generates its own set of important problems (particularly when they are not there to advocate for themselves), eliminates pressures that might otherwise trouble the centrality of our own suffering \u2013 and of the suffering of the marginalized people that do happen to make it into rooms with us.", "The dangers with this feature of deference politics are grave, as are the risks for those outside of the most powerful rooms. For those who are deferred to, it can supercharge group-undermining norms. In Conflict is Not Abuse, Sarah Schulman makes a provocative observation about the psychological effects of both trauma and felt superiority: while these often come about for different reasons and have very different moral statuses, they result in similar behavioural patterns. Chief among these are misrepresenting the stakes of conflict (often by overstating harm) or representing others\u2019 independence as a hostile threat (such as failures to \u201ccentre\u201d the right topics or people). These behaviours, whatever their causal history, have corrosive effects on individuals who perform them as well as the groups around them, especially when a community\u2019s norms magnify or multiply these behaviours rather than constraining or metabolizing them.", "For those who defer, the habit can supercharge moral cowardice. The norms provide social cover for the abdication of responsibility: it displaces onto individual heroes, a hero class, or a mythicized past the work that is ours to do now in the present. Their perspective may be clearer on this or that specific matter, but their overall point of view isn\u2019t any less particular or constrained by history than ours. More importantly, deference places the accountability that is all of ours to bear onto select people \u2013 and, more often than not, a hyper-sanitized and thoroughly fictional caricature of them.", "The same tactics of deference that insulate us from criticism also insulate us from connection and transformation. They prevent us from engaging empathetically and authentically with the struggles of other people \u2013 prerequisites of coalitional politics. As identities become more and more fine-grained and disagreements sharper, we come to realize that \u201ccoalitional politics\u201d (understood as struggle across difference) is, simply, politics. Thus, the deferential orientation, like that fragmentation of political collectivity it enables, is ultimately anti-political.", "Deference rather than interdependence may soothe short-term psychological wounds. But it does so at a steep cost: it can undermine the epistemic goals that motivate the project, and it entrenches a politics unbefitting of anyone fighting for freedom rather than for privilege, for collective liberation rather than mere parochial advantage.", "How would a constructive approach to putting standpoint epistemology into practice differ from a deferential approach? A constructive approach would focus on the pursuit of specific goals or end results rather than avoiding \u201ccomplicity\u201d in injustice or adhering to moral principles. It would be concerned primarily with building institutions and cultivating practices of information-gathering rather than helping. It would focus on accountability rather than conformity. It would calibrate itself directly to the task of redistributing social resources and power rather than to intermediary goals cashed out in terms of pedestals or symbolism. It would focus on building and rebuilding rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them \u2013 it would be a world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual structures of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique of the ones we already have.", "The water crisis in Flint, Michigan presents a clear example of both the possibilities and limitations of refining our epistemic politics in this way. Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), a government body tasked with the support of \u201chealthy communities\u201d, with a team of fifty trained scientists at its disposal, was complicit in covering up the scale and gravity of the public health crisis from the beginning of the crisis in 2014 until it garnered national attention in 2015.", "The MDEQ, speaking from a position of epistemic and political authority, defended the status quo in Flint. They claimed that \u201cFlint water is safe to drink\u201d, and were cited in Flint Mayor Dayne Walling\u2019s statement aiming to \u201cdispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River\u201d during the April 2014 transition to the Flint River water source. That transition was spearheaded under the tenure of the city\u2019s emergency manager Darnell Earley (an African-American, like many of the city residents he helped to poison). After the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) circulated a leaked internal memo from the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in July of 2014 expressing concern about lead in Flint water, the MDEQ produced a doctored report that put the overall measure of lead levels within federally mandated levels by mysteriously failing to count two contaminated samples.", "The reaction from residents was immediate. The month after the switch in water source, residents reported that their tap water was discoloured and gave off an alarming odour. They didn\u2019t need their oppression to be \u201ccelebrated\u201d, \u201ccentred\u201d, or narrated in the newest academic parlance. They didn\u2019t need someone to understand what it felt like to be poisoned. What they needed was the lead out of their water. So they got to work.", "The first step was to develop epistemic authority. To achieve this they built a new room: one that put Flint residents and activists in active collaboration with scientists who had the laboratories that could run the relevant tests and prove the MDEQ\u2019s report to be fraudulent. Flint residents\u2019 outcry recruited scientists to their cause and led a \u201ccitizen science\u201d campaign, further raising the alarm about the water quality and distributing sample kits to neighbours to submit for testing. In this stage, the alliance of residents and scientists won, and the poisoning of the children of Flint emerged as a national scandal.", "But this was not enough. The second step \u2013 cleaning the water \u2013 required more than state acknowledgement: it required apportioning labour and resources to fix the water and address the continuing health concerns. What Flint residents received, initially, was a mix of platitudes and mockery from the ruling elite (some of this personally committed by a President that shared a racial identity with many of them). This year, however, it looks as though the tireless activism of Flint residents and their expanding list of teammates has won additional and more meaningful victories: the ongoing campaign is pushing the replacements of the problematic service lines to their final stage and is forcing the state of Michigan to agree to a settlement of $600 million for affected families.", "This outcome is in no way a wholesale victory: not only will attorney fees cut a substantial portion of payouts, but the settlement cannot undo the damage that was caused to the residents. A constructive epistemology cannot guarantee full victory over an oppressive system by itself. No epistemic orientation can by itself undo the various power asymmetries between the people and the imperial state system. But it can help make the game a little more competitive \u2013 and deference epistemology isn\u2019t even playing.", "The biggest threats to social justice attention and informational economies are not the absence of yet more jargon to describe, ever more precisely or incisively, the epistemic, attentional, or interpersonal afflictions of the disempowered. The biggest threats are the erosion of the practical and material bases for popular power over knowledge production and distribution, particularly that which could aid effective political action and constrain or eliminate predation by elites. The capture and corruption of these bases by well-positioned elites, especially tech corporations, goes on unabated and largely unchallenged, including: the corporate monopolization of local news, the ongoing destruction and looting of the journalistic profession, the interference of corporations and governments in key democratic processes, and the domination of elite interests in the production of knowledge by research universities and the circulation of the output of these distorted processes by established media organizations.", "Confronting these threats requires leaving some rooms \u2013 and building new ones.", "The constructive approach to standpoint epistemology is demanding. It asks that we swim upstream: to be accountable and responsive to people who aren\u2019t yet in the room, to build the kinds of rooms we could sit in together, rather than merely judiciously navigating the rooms history has built for us. But this weighty demand is par for the course when it comes to the politics of knowledge: the American philosopher Sandra Harding famously pointed out that standpoint epistemology, properly understood, demands more rigour from science and knowledge production processes generally, not less.", "But one important topic stands unaddressed. The deferential approach to standpoint epistemology often comes packaged with concern and attention to the importance of lived experience. Among these, traumatic experiences are especially foregrounded.", "At this juncture, scholarly analysis and argument fail me. The remainder of what I have to say skews more towards conviction than contention. But the life of books has taught me that conviction has just as much to teach, however differently posed or processed, and so I press on.", "I take concerns about trauma especially seriously. I grew up in the United States, a nation structured by settler colonialism, racial slavery, and their aftermath, with enough collective and historical trauma to go round. I also grew up in a Nigerian diasporic community, populated by many who had genocide in living memory. At the national and community level, I have seen a lot of traits of norms, personality, quirks of habit and action that I\u2019ve suspected were downstream of these facts. At the level of individual experience, I\u2019ve watched and felt myself change in reaction to fearing for my dignity or life, to crushing pain and humiliation. I reflect on these traumatic moments often, and very seldom think: \u201cThat was educational\u201d.", "These experiences can be, if we are very fortunate, building blocks. What comes of them depends on how the blocks are put together: what standpoint epistemologists call the \u201cachievement thesis\u201d. Briana Toole clarifies that, by itself, one\u2019s social location only puts a person in a position to know. \u201cEpistemic privilege\u201d or advantage is achieved only through deliberate, concerted struggle from that position.", "I concede outright that this is certainly one possible result of the experience of oppression: have no doubt that humiliation, deprivation, and suffering can build (especially in the context of the deliberate, structured effort of \u201cconsciousness raising\u201d, as Toole specifically highlights). But these same experiences can also destroy, and if I had to bet on which effect would win most often, it would be the latter. As Agnes Callard rightly notes, trauma (and even the righteous, well-deserved anger that often accompanies it) can corrupt as readily as it can ennoble. Perhaps more so.", "Contra the old expression, pain \u2013 whether borne of oppression or not \u2013 is a poor teacher. Suffering is partial, short-sighted, and self-absorbed. We shouldn\u2019t have a politics that expects different: oppression is not a prep school.", "When it comes down to it, the thing I believe most deeply about deference epistemology is that it asks something of trauma that it cannot give. Demanding as the constructive approach may be, the deferential approach is far more demanding and in a far more unfair way: it asks the traumatized to shoulder burdens alone that we ought to share collectively. When I think about my trauma, I don\u2019t think about grand lessons. I think about the quiet nobility of survival. The very fact that those chapters weren\u2019t the final ones of my story is powerful enough writing all on its own. It is enough to ask of those experiences that I am still here to remember them.", "Deference epistemology asks us to be less than we are \u2013 and not even for our own benefit. As Nick Estes explains in the context of Indigenous politics: \u201cThe cunning of trauma politics is that it turns actual people and struggles, whether racial or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, into matters of injury. It defines an entire people mostly on their trauma and not by their aspirations or sheer humanity\u201d. This performance is not for the benefit of Indigenous people, but \u201cfor white audiences or institutions of power\u201d.", "I also think about James Baldwin\u2019s realization that the things that tormented him the most were \u201cthe very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive\u201d. That I have survived abuse of various kinds, have faced near-death from both accidental circumstance and violence (different as the particulars of these may be from those around me) is not a card to play in gamified social interaction or a weapon to wield in battles over prestige. It is not what gives me a special right to speak, to evaluate, or to decide for a group. It is a concrete, experiential manifestation of the vulnerability that connects me to most of the people on this Earth. It comes between me and other people not as a wall, but as a bridge."], "id": "684ee32ca114be932d98ce9ed1013da6a1605b8faa29102f22500692dd88cfb7", "highlighted_text": " when people say \u201c listen to

Capitalism, and Critique eds. Bottici & Bargu p. 57-62", "body": ["", "In the conclusion of her response to Dawson, Fraser argues that the state played a key role in promoting colonial slavery and the plantation system. It was the state, she explains, which validates expropriation and which is responsible for a \u201cpolitical subjectivation\u201d (2016). While this may have been the case in other social regimes, the state played a surprisingly modest role in the running of plantation slavery in the Americas, from its seventeenth-century origins to its nineteenth-century climax. The colonial state did recognize plantation wealth, but it was the competitive Atlantic context which gave freelance merchants and bankers their chance and which they perfected with the \u201cSecond Slavery\u201d of the nineteenth century (Tomich 2004; Johnson 2013; Baptist 2014). The colonial trading companies failed in the Americas. The plantation boom was the work of independent planters and traders, beginning as \u201cinterlopers,\u201d practicing de facto free trade. These classic entrepreneurs carried millions of captives across the ocean. Traders, planters and factors learned from one another and devised many of their own laws in their own assemblies. The French colonial merchants insisted that they must have unfettered access to European markets and one of them - the merchant economist Thomas Le Gendre - invented the slogan laissez faire, laissez passer. The French royal authorities drew up the Code Noir, but colonial proprietors simply ignored any regulations they disliked. Racial slavery in the English American colonies was very much a product of civil society, not the state. John Locke was responsible in the 1690s for revising or approving colonial laws as director of the Southern department of the Board of Trade. But the great philosopher thought the colonial slaveholders were a valuable check on royal power so did nothing to weaken their position. This foundational moment saw a colonial institution - chattel slavery - accepted by the metropolis, not imposed by the metropolis on the colonies.", "The US Constitution, in deference to planter wishes, provided for a minimal state with the lowest possible taxes (Einhorn 2008), with law and order being guaranteed by local militia and patrols not federal troops. The US Army numbered 18,000 in 1820, compared with over 400,000 state militia. And the Militia Act of 1792 explained that all \u201cwhite men\u201d were to be enrolled in it, an injunction that applied to the North as well as South. (The African American \u201cpessimists\u201d argue that the North/South \u201cbinary\u201d on race is generally misleading.) The planters faced varied resistance but made their own security arrangements, which were quite effective down to 1860 - and again after 1877. Slaveholders everywhere in the Americas had a lively fear of meddling by metropolitan philanthropists and ignoramuses. In the United States in the 1850s, the Southern slaveholders were so alarmed by the prospect of a Republican president that they took the huge gamble of secession to avoid it. The slaveholders could maintain dominance within their own areas, but they had a horror of unreliable federal office-holders, of anti-slavery propaganda and of a fickle Northern public opinion. Fraser\u2019s argument that the slaveholders needed the state because they needed \u201cpolitical subjectivation\u201d would be very relevant here.", "If we look at Jim Crow and the reconstruction of white supremacy in the US South, it showed similar ambivalence and was anchored in civil society not the federal state. The main Southern demand was for \u201cstates rights\u201d and Southern autonomy. The \u201cexpropriation\u201d and terrorization of the former slave were guaranteed by patrols and militia organized by the slaveholders themselves. In some parts of the South, US occupation saw a challenge to planter power in 1868-77 but almost immediately the planter militias and patrols morphed into white vigilante groups, which reflected local white power structures.", "Frank Wilderson is right to locate the racial dynamic of domination and capitalism close to the ground level. The subtitle of his article is \u201cWhither the Slave in Civil Society?\u201d (Wilderson 2003). Slaveholders needed the state, and they needed allies, but they were not confident that they could rely on either in a crisis. Wilderson draws attention to the ubiquity of planter patrols and militias in slave societies. After the failure of Reconstruction, the disciplinary function belonged to the local state. In more recent times the National Guard, police and vigilante groups directly inherit the role of enforcer of the racial order.", "Yet, Radical Reconstruction bequeathed more of a legacy of autonomy and resistance than the \u201cpessimists\u201d allow. The freedmen and -women had participated in Black Conventions and endorsed a Declaration of Rights and Wrongs. They fought against lynch mobs and, in an innovative move, campaigned for the \u201cpublic right\u201d of equal access to public accommodation and transport. This approach was to overcome the abstraction and passivity of some varieties of \u201crights-bearing.\u201d African Americans created schools, colleges, choirs and churches where a black community could take shape (Scott 2006).", "When Reconstruction collapsed with the withdrawal of federal forces from the South, it was replaced by a decentralized regime of terror, which combined elements of spontaneity with the backing of former Confederate officers. The willingness of the authorities in Washington, DC, went along with Southern lynching and segregation from a mixture of fear and fellow feeling. Intervening in the South would be expensive and unpopular. The initiative still lay with such civil society actors as planters, landlords, storekeepers and bankers.", "Fraser writes that \u201cthe United States perpetuated its \u2018internal colony\u2019 by transforming recently emancipated slaves into debt peons through the share-cropping system\u201d (Fraser 2016). The way this is phrased does not sufficiently acknowledge the role of the Southern elite, which had its own agenda that it was often able to impose on Washington. It was a junior partner nationally but exercised a monopoly of power in its own region. Moreover, its very existence rendered racism respectable throughout the Union. The North made huge concessions to the South because Northern Republicans feared the Southern elite and often shared their contemptuous views about blacks. Racism, like patriarchy, thrived because of its roots in civil society and the continuing weakness of the federal state. White supremacy was based on the facts on the ground, on armed bodies of white men.", "Where Does Anti-Racism Come From?", "In her fascinating concluding sketch, Fraser has little to say about the historic defeats inflicted on racism in the mid-twentieth century - the defeat of Nazi Germany, the rise and fall of Imperial Japan, the founding of the United Nations, the Chinese Revolution, the anti-colonial revolutions, the civil rights struggle in the United States and the downfall of apartheid. Racism stubbornly survives, and the successes and failures of capitalism generate new varieties of racial oppression. But nevertheless, white supremacy and other forms of institutional racism have been deeply discredited. Indeed, the glaring contradiction between racial regimes and their official demise contributes greatly to the \u201clegitimacy crisis\u201d of today\u2019s still-racialized capitalism.", "The word \u201cracism\u201d acquired negative and critical connotations only very recently. As a critical concept it dates from the twentieth century and was only widely adopted in the anti-colonial and anti-fascist movements. The defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan did much to discredit racism, an ideology and practice that imbued European colonialism, US segregation and South African apartheid (Cox 1949; Kovel 1970). W. E. B. Dubois, the NAACP and the Haarlem Renaissance helped to renew the tradition of black abolitionism and to transmit it to new generations. The emergent post-war world saw East and West competing for influence. According to the new human rights doctrine,white racists were enemies of progress because they denied the respect due to all members of the human race. The US tolerance of segregation and apartheid seriously weakened its international standing.", "If we ask where the new anti-racist norms come from, then part of the answer would be, as Lynn Hunt has shown, the abolitionist and neo- abolitionist movements (Hunt 2007). They challenged racist doctrines and practices and fostered an alliance between anti-colonial and antiapartheid movements and the struggle for racial justice in the United States. The emergence of national liberation movements and the emergence of the \u201cthird world\u201d directly inspired - and were inspired by - the indictment of racism found in the writings of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ruth Benedict, Oliver Cromwell Cox, Claude Levi-Strauss, Franz Fanon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Joel Kovel, and the work and the testimony of many other writers and activists. The rejection of Western racism and colonialism was an intellectual, cultural and political achievement of anti-colonial, anti-fascist, anti-apartheid and black liberation movements, each of which helped anti-racism to avoid false universalism and empty formalism. Western capitalism was nourished by a host of expropriations, but some currents of liberal and bourgeois thought and politics broke with colonial and racial paternalism and welcomed the UN General Declaration of Human Rights, the latter inspired by the neo-abolitionist NAACP.", "While incomplete and flawed in various ways, the General Declaration furnished a key reference point for anti-racist mobilization. Attempts to portray the discourse of \u201chuman rights\u201d as a purely bourgeois construction, as is sometimes claimed by both partisans and critics, are misguided. But the sorts of class struggle typically provoked by capitalist accumulation and appropriation - and most particularly by \u201cexpropriation\u201d - often strive to combine anti-racist and anti-capitalist themes. Thomas Haskell claimed that \u201chumanitarianism\u201d was the result of horizons gradually enlarged by the spread of market relations (Bender 1992). There is a grain of truth in this, yet real advances arose at times of rupture and class struggle, and they reflected fear of markets as well as the broader connections they reveal. Anti-racism arose in the 1930s and registered few solid gains prior to the UN General Declaration of 1948. Prior to this, US New Dealers and European Liberals and Socialists were typically complicit with Southern or colonial racism. During the interwar period the international Communist movement was almost alone in campaigning against white racism and colonialism. The UN General Declaration arose from Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s response to the initiatives ofW. E. B. Du Bois and the Soviet delegation (Hunt 2007, Blackburn 2011).", "Fraser powerfully advances our understanding of the ways in which capitalism generates inequality and exclusion, thereby fostering and feeding racialization. The impetus here derives from civil society. However, the state certainly furnishes guarantees, legitimacy and powers to these social relations, a fact that becomes very visible at times of general crisis, war and revolution. At such times the ruling order was divided and the oppressed and excluded could make their presence felt. The test of war and revolution generates a need for mobilizing appeals that could challenge oppression and gain wide acceptance. It furnishes points of rupture. However, vigilance is in order because state elites can be easily distracted and forces within civil society inimical to racial equality will undermine and falsify prior gains."], "id":

early December 2013, Senegalese artist Issa Samb donned a black leather jacket and beret, grasped a spear in his left hand and a M1 carbine rifle in his right, and settled into a rattan throne. Samb\u2019s live performance replicated the 1967 photo of Huey Newton, carefully staged by Eldridge Cleaver in the Ramparts magazine office, that would become the most iconic representation of Black Panther Party militancy and internationalism. Samb chose to recreate the famous image in an abandoned storefront that had previously housed a Harold\u2019s Chicken restaurant, along Chicago\u2019s Garfield Boulevard. His performance was part of a weeklong series of events hosted by the University of Chicago to commemorate the 1969 police killings of Illinois Panthers Mark Clark and Fred Hampton and to encourage reflection on the party\u2019s legacy. Titled \u201cThe Best Marxist is Dead,\u201d Samb\u2019s performance might be read as a commentary on the perils of Black Power nostalgia and as a call for the renewed critique of capitalism within black public life and a radical left politics keenly attuned to new historical conditions.", "Samb\u2019s performance is an homage that evokes Newton\u2019s notion of revolutionary suicide \u2014 the true show of radical commitment is the willingness to dedicate one\u2019s full energy and time, and potentially one\u2019s life, to revolutionary struggle. The performance title and Newton\u2019s radical pledge are both in keeping with the Panther quip, \u201cThe only good pig is a dead one.\u201d If the police constituted an \u201coccupying army,\u201d then liberating the ghetto from their grip would require an equal magnitude of force and sacrifice.", "Samb\u2019s performance recalled Newton, but it did not copy him. Samb\u2019s grey beard and locks contrasted sharply with Newton\u2019s clean-shaven, youthful appearance. And where Newton sits with his feet firmly planted, meeting his onlookers with a militant, unflinching gaze, Samb\u2019s legs were crossed and his countenance was more introspective, his eyes sullen. He was the old man who has outlived the revolution, or maybe he\u2019s a ghost. We worship long-dead heroes because they are no longer a part of the difficult tug and pull of historical forces that make our own world. Samb presented us with the revolutionary in the glass case \u2014 perhaps a reference to the macabre practice of embalming state socialism\u2019s founders in perpetuity. The revolutionary is entombed, walled off from our own cultural and social world, no longer a part of our sense of living political possibilities.", "Sitting on the edge of some of Chicago\u2019s most impoverished and violent neighborhoods, the abandoned storefront itself signals death \u2014 yet another casualty in the cycles of divestment, real estate speculation, and displacement afflicting central cities across the United States. Not long into Samb\u2019s performance, these looming urban realities interrupted the celebration, after a scuffle broke out between groups of young men assembled in an upstairs art gallery for the opening reception. Within minutes, police cruisers careened onto the sidewalk, flak-jacketed officers rushed inside to quell the disturbance, and many attendees, some of them Panther veterans, were left shaking their heads in disbelief. In its juxtaposition of movement nostalgia and lingering urban misery, Samb\u2019s performance inspired revival, the revolutionary apparition staring back once again from a blighted corner of the ghetto.", "The slogan \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d rose to prominence the summer before Samb\u2019s storefront performance. Three black feminist activists created the Twitter hashtag after the 2012 vigilante killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen in Sanford, Florida. Over the past few years thousands have embraced the slogan, protesting sporting events, staging die-ins on sidewalks, occupying public offices, and shutting down highways. Such actions have forced the undeserved deaths of black civilians into the public conscience and created a crisis of legitimacy for the dominant approaches to urban policing. Although struggles against policing have a much longer lineage, the current renewal of anti-racist organizing crystallized out of discrete historical conjunctures \u2014 the comprehensive surveillance of society through private and public security video feeds and smartphone cameras, the advent of social media networks that connect millions of users worldwide and enable instantaneous circulation of information, the hollowing out of the social welfare state and further deterioration of inner-city life in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing recession, and the debates over post-racialism that accompanied the Obama presidency.", "Despite the frequency and power of mass demonstrations, at the time of this writing, we are no closer to achieving concrete, substantive reform that might curtail police violence and ensure greater democratic accountability. To be frank, if we are going to end this crisis and achieve genuine public safety and peace, the current struggles must grow beyond street demonstrations to build popular consensus and effective power. The road to reaching those ends is currently blocked. Part of the problem resides in the prevailing nostalgia for Black Power militancy and the continued pursuit of modes of black ethnic politics. Such nostalgia is underwritten by the vindicationist posture of recent scholarly writing on the subject and is abetted by the digital afterlife of movement imagery, which preserves the most emotionally impactful elements of the movement but is consumed in ways that forget Black Power\u2019s historical origins and intrinsic limitations.", "At the heart of contemporary organizing is the notion of black exceptionalism. Contemporary Black Lives Matter activists and supporters insist on the uniqueness of the black predicament and on the need for race-specific remedies. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise,\u201d #BlackLivesMatter co-founder Alicia Garza explains. \u201cIt is an affirmation of Black folks\u2019 contributions to this society, our humanity and our resistance in the face of deadly oppression.\u201d1 \u201cWhen we say black lives matter,\u201d Garza continues, \u201cwe are talking about the ways in which Black people are deprived of our basic human rights and dignity. It is an acknowledgement [that] Black poverty and genocide [are] state violence.\u201d This essay takes aim at this notion of black exceptionalism and lays out its origins and limits as an analysis of hyperpolicing and, more generally, as an effective political orientation capable of building the popular power needed to end the policing crisis.", "We begin by revisiting the social and ideological roots of black ethnic politics as we know it. Black Power unfolded within a context of class fragmentation; the decline of the left-labor militancy of the Depression, wartime, and the post\u2013World War II years; and the transformation of metropolitan space after the 1949 Housing Act, which produced suburban homeownership and upward mobility for many whites and inner-city ghettoization and exploitation for the black poor. The combination of shifting urban demography, rising black political efficacy created by the Southern civil rights/desegregation campaigns, and the liberal statecraft of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration framed the turn to Black Power and associated demands for black control of political and economic institutions. In the Black Power era, we can see the origins of contemporary hyper-ghettoization and intensive policing of the black poor as well as the ascendancy of post-segregation patron-client relations between an expanding black professional-managerial class and the mainstream parties, corporations, and private foundations. This evolution of Black Power as an elite-driven ethnic politics ultimately negated and transcended the revolutionary potential implied in calls for black self-determination and socialist revolution. If you believe that the \u201cMovement for Black Lives\u201d is the second coming of Black Power, this historical process may give us some sense of where it is going.", "The notion of black ethnic politics remains at the heart of Black Lives Matter protests and falsely equates racial identity with political constituency. Black Power and Black Lives Matter as political slogans are rooted in racial-standpoint epistemology \u2014 that is, the notion that, by virtue of the common experience of racism, African Americans possess territorial ways of knowing the world and, by extension, deeply shared political interests. This commonsensical view is a mystification that elides the differing and conflicting material interests and ideological positions that animate black political life in real time and space.", "The second part of this essay examines these differences and conflicts in light of the celebrated release of the Vision for Black Lives agenda, which contains a set of progressive policy demands but is guided by the counterproductive assumptions of black unity politics, which have historically facilitated elite brokerage dynamics rather than building effective counterpower. Just as readily as it can be used to advance left social justice demands, the Black Lives Matter slogan can \u2014 and on occasion already has \u2014 become a vehicle for entrepreneurial branding and courting philanthropic foundations. Similarly, it can express bourgeois interests (e.g., \u201cBlack Wealth Matters\u201d) and education-privatization agendas just as easily as it can express working-class interests and the promotion of public education.", "The third section of this essay develops a critique of black exceptionalism, the central premise of contemporary discussions of inequality and campaigns against police violence. The current policing crisis and carceral state are not a reincarnation of the Jim Crow regime. They are, rather, core features of post-welfare-state capitalism, where punitive strategies for managing social inequality have replaced benevolent welfare-state interventions and where managing the surplus population has become a key function of law enforcement and the prison system. Allusions to a new Jim Crow racism continue to have moral sway in some corners and retain the capacity to mobilize citizens in large numbers, but the analysis that underpins them is inadequate to provide the foundations for building left politics. If the current struggles are to become an aggregate force powerful enough to win concrete gains in terms of social justice, a critical first step is for activists to abandon this tendency to substitute analogy for analysis. The premise of black exceptionalism obscures contemporary social realities and actual political alignments and forestalls honest conversations about the real class interests dominating today\u2019s neoliberal urban landscape.", "The Roots of Black Ethnic Politics", "The familiar leftist lore of Black Power is one of a heroic movement, a time when black denizens rose up in insurrection against imperialism on foreign shores and in the heart of the nation\u2019s cities, a movement where revolutionary dreams of black liberation were crushed by state repression. The broad outlines of this story are true, but the history of Black Power is more complex. The origins of Black Power rest in the unique social and demographic realities of black urban life after World War II and, equally, in the social consequences and limits of the Second Reconstruction: liberal policy reforms produced by the interplay of civil rights movement pressure and the presidential administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, which abolished legal segregation in the South and integrated blacks as consumer-citizens.", "Black mass migration after World War II and the segregative dynamics of housing policy under the Harry Truman presidency created the social preconditions for this era of reform and black urban empowerment. A manifestation of real estate industry power, the 1949 Housing Act set in motion the radical spatial transformation of American cities, earmarking funds for urban renewal and public housing construction and creating federally insured mortgages for suburban single-family-home purchases \u2014 measures that combined to produce the urban-suburban wealth inequality that would define American public life for more than a half-century.", "Housing discrimination and ethnic-enclave settlement patterns limited most blacks to the same proximal urban neighborhoods, even though those black ghettos were internally stratified along class lines, with the black middle class occupying better, safer housing stock.2 Postwar urban renewal further concretized this residential apartheid, as federal interstate highways and other massive public projects bisected black neighborhoods, dispersing residents, destroying the urban fabric, devaluing adjacent property, and often serving as physical walls dividing black areas from those of other ethnicities. Slum clearance and the construction of tower-block housing, which were widely supported by downtown commercial interests and social reformers, momentarily improved the environs of those previously relegated to dangerous, unsanitary tenement conditions, but these developments were in effect a form of vertical ghettoization.", "During the same epoch, the peacetime industrial demobilization undermined many black workers\u2019 attempts to find gainful employment and earn a living wage. Given their status as newcomers in many industries, they were among the first to be handed pink slips during cyclical downturns. The relocation of manufacturing facilities from city centers to suburban greenfields and the ongoing adoption of labor-saving production technology further diminished job prospects for less skilled and less educated black urban newcomers. Chrysler autoworker James Boggs was among the first black intellectuals to offer a critical left perspective of industrial automation, cybernetics, and their political implications within and beyond the factory gates.3 Boggs referred to the black men he increasingly saw standing idle on Detroit street corners as \u201coutsiders,\u201d \u201cexpendables,\u201d and \u201cuntouchables,\u201d those who were among the first to experience technological obsolescence and had little hope of industrial integration. This figure of black unemployed youth during the late fifties and early sixties should have served as a miner\u2019s canary, a harbinger of the precarious conditions produced by labor arbitrage and technology-intensive production, as well as plain and simple prolonged recession and rationalization of the work force by way of speedup. But their plight was drowned out in the high tide of postwar economic prosperity during the sixties and early seventies; in liberal circles, their condition was explained in a manner that disconnected the black urban poor from the rest of the working class. Black Power militants would speak directly to these conditions of unemployment and ghetto isolation, but their movement did not only emerge from below in response to the oppressive conditions facing the ghetto/black urban population, as is commonly asserted. Rather, it was also encouraged by liberal statecraft from above.", "Historians of the Black Power era tend to neglect the relationship between its popular manifestations and Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty initiative. This is an unfortunate oversight that may stem in part from the desire of some scholars to valorize black self-activity. But the resulting interpretive bias has no doubt stalled the development of analyses that fully appreciate the complex origins and built-in limitations of Black Power as a sociopolitical phenomenon. Even before \u201cBlack Power\u201d became a popular slogan, one that was simultaneously edifying to many blacks who desired real self-determination and frightening to some whites who associated it with violent retribution, liberals in the Johnson White House were retailing their own version of black empowerment: one that addressed class inequality, but in a language of ethno-cultural exceptionalism.", "Johnson\u2019s assistant secretary of labor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, took the lead in this regard, authoring his report The Negro Family: The Case for National Action to build support for progressive legislation addressing urban poverty. In his 1965 Howard University commencement address, Johnson best summed up the core assumption of the Moynihan report when he asserted, \u201cNegro poverty is not white poverty.\u201d4 Working under this notion of Negro exceptionalism, Moynihan argued that black poverty amid white prosperity was due to a combination of institutional racism and the alleged cultural pathology of the black poor themselves. This \u201cculture of poverty\u201d sentiment was widely embraced by Moynihan\u2019s contemporaries, including such diverse figures as anthropologist Oscar Lewis, sociologist Kenneth Clark, and even democratic socialist Michael Harrington.5 Yet some Black Power elements would also accept this culturalist argument, even if their politics were more radical \u2014 recall the Black Panthers\u2019 formative position on the lumpenproletariat, which cast this substratum as dysfunctional but potentially revolutionary. This Cold War turn toward cultural explanations of minority poverty within the liberal wing of the New Deal coalition marked a rejection of the class-centered politics that had defined both the labor militancy of the interwar period and the political orientation of the postwar civil rights movement.", "The shifting terrain of working-class consciousness and politics within American life during the sixties was the direct result of decades-long interrelated processes. Progressive labor activism was undermined in part by the rise in wages and benefits that resulted from the high levels of investment and employment that came with the long postwar boom, and which provided the basis for the expansion of a normative middle-class ideal of homeownership and leisure consumption. It was tamed, too, by the anticommunist witch-hunts that targeted unions, left parties, civil rights organizations, and Hollywood. Reflecting the balance of class forces during the 1930s, the New Deal was a tangible expression of the interests of particular blocs of capital as well as the outcome of constraints that workers and popular movements imposed on capitalism.6 The National Recovery Administration sought to address the capitalist contradictions that led to the 1929 stock-market crash and ensuing crisis, the weak regulation of the financial markets, and the surplus-absorption problem stemming from the lack of effective demand for manufactured goods. The 1935 Wagner Act\u2019s formal recognition of the right to organize was intended to stabilize labor-management relations and provide a means for resolving disputes in a manner that did not disrupt production and capital flows. This legislation responded to the massive pressure from below that came with the explosion of labor militancy that culminated in three great urban general strikes in 1934. Those strikes had the effect of stimulating a wave of shop-floor organizing led by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which was founded in 1935 as a breakaway from the more conservative, craft-oriented American Federation of Labor. Through militant tactics and vigorous organizing, the CIO succeeded in unionizing workers in factories, steel mills, shipyards, docks, and packinghouses throughout the United States and Canada. In response to a wave of CIO-led strikes after the war, Congress passed the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which criminalized solidarity and the general strike, signaling the effective end of the era of CIO militancy \u2014 the organization was reunited with the AFL in 1955 \u2014 and ushering in a period of mostly business-centered labor relations.7", "Contrary to the popular view of the fifties as an era of mass quiescence, labor unrest continued through the decade, but the expansion of the consumer society and the growth of suburbia weakened progressive unionism. The hearts and minds of many American workers were won over to capitalist growth imperatives through the promise of rising wages, spacious tract housing, the personal mobility of automobile culture, and the enlarged leisure industries reflected in television, drive-in theaters, and shopping malls. The pastoral and technological comforts of suburbia reminded Americans of capitalism\u2019s virtues, while active state repression prescribed clear social consequences to those who dared openly criticize the system\u2019s contradictions and faults.", "Beginning with the Palmer Raids of 1919 and 1920, where socialists and anarchists were rounded up, arrested and deported, the US state and local police took a more prominent role in repressing workplace organizing. With the creation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the national state consolidated, enlarged, and rationalized the policing of working-class militancy that in earlier moments of class struggle had been undertaken by Pinkerton saboteurs and hired guns. Reliance on repressive forces at the state and local level played an important part in limiting the impact of workers\u2019 mass militancy in the early New Deal years. After World War II and as US\u2013Soviet tensions sharpened with the instigation of Truman, the ruling class undertook a concerted campaign to extinguish Communist influence within domestic trade unions. The campaign against the radical left, led by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, blacklisted and harassed scores of citizens suspected of Communist sympathy and took an obsessive interest in rooting out reds in the Screen Actors Guild, given the enlarged role of television and movies in shaping American leisure culture, romantic sentiments, and political dispositions.", "McCarthyism was especially consequential for the struggle to defeat Jim Crow, since the Communist Party (CP) had played a pivotal role in addressing the \u201cNegro question\u201d during the interwar period through the Scottsboro Boys trials, the formation of the National Negro Congress (NNC), and organizing black sharecroppers in the Deep South. Black and white leftists with ties to the CP and the union movement also built powerful support networks and activist training programs, such the Highlander Folk School. Red-baiting destroyed careers and reputations, bred suspicion and distrust within the Left, and had a chilling effect on the postwar civil rights movement, bolstering liberal integration as the most viable option for black emancipation within the Cold War context. Liberal anti-racism found traction in this context of defeated labor militancy, one where open class analysis and commitment to socialist revolution often spelled financial and personal ruin for those who dared stray from the emergent Cold War rules of acceptable political discourse.", "In his analysis of how liberals like Moynihan came to separate race and class, historian Tour\u00e9 Reed reminds us that during the interwar period, through World War II, and well after, organizing based on class was widely accepted as an effective way for blacks to amass power and secure economic gains \u2014 specifically participation in the dynamic labor movement of the era. Civil rights leaders like A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters union and the wartime March on Washington Movement, Lester Granger of the National Urban League, Walter White of the NAACP, and John P. Davis of the NNC all \u201cfrequently argued that precisely because most blacks were working class, racial equality could only be achieved through a combination of anti-discrimination policies and social-democratic economic policies.\u201d8 Some latter-day Black Lives Matter activists, Reed notes, might well reject such a position, which was commonly held by labor and civil rights veterans during the sixties, as \u201cvulgar class reductionis[m].\u201d Although he would increasingly embrace a politics of insider negotiation during the sixties, veteran activist Bayard Rustin insisted that black progress could only be achieved through the development of broad, interracial coalitions dedicated to social democracy, a position that drew the ire of some Black Power radicals.9 The social-democratic perspective touted by Randolph, Rustin, and others was clearly expressed in their 1966 Freedom Budget and actually continued to resonate throughout the decade \u2014 perhaps most famously in the 1963 March on Washington but also, for example, in the Memphis sanitation workers\u2019 strike actively supported by Martin Luther King Jr. But this political tendency was ultimately eclipsed by the liberal Democratic focus on racial discrimination and the culture of poverty as distinct problems, separate from the labor-management accord, unionization, and matters of political economy.10", "The liberal decoupling of race and class supplanted more radical versions of working-class left politics with far-reaching political consequences, operating now as a form of common sense. During the sixties, this view of Negro exceptionalism filled the vacuum left by interwar labor militancy. It gained traction with the deepening physical separation of black and white workers, which came with the spatial transformation of cities that sent white workers and much industry to the suburbs and left blacks in the urban ghettos. Moreover, by framing the problem of black poverty in terms of discrimination and alleged cultural pathology, liberals, who were now strongly allied with capital, systematically failed to address structural unemployment and the prevalence of nonunion, unprotected employment, two of the root causes of durable poverty among urban blacks. Liberal anti-poverty efforts were limited, as many black activists readily pointed out at the time. Unlike the New Deal legislation, which expanded collective bargaining rights and public works, the Johnson administration\u2019s Great Society legislation took care not to upset the lucrative patronage relations between the federal government and private contractors in the construction and defense sectors, central motors of the postwar economic boom. The Great Society was limited in its capacity to end black urban poverty but powerful in terms of its political impact, as it subsidized and legitimated the expansion of a postsegregation black political elite.", "The Johnson administration oversaw a period of domestic social reform that restored black civil rights and went a step further in providing various forms of targeted aid to address racial and urban inequality. Historian Kent Germany examines how War on Poverty reforms were implemented in New Orleans and their consequences for the growth of the black professional-managerial class there. He characterizes the War on Poverty approach as a soft state, \u201ca loose set of short-term political and bureaucratic arrangements that linked together federal bureaucracies, neighborhood groups, nonprofit organizations, semipublic political organizations, social agencies, and, primarily after 1970, local government\u201d to distribute federal funding to predominantly black neighborhoods.11 The Community Action Program, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), Head Start, and Job Corps, as well as the 1966 Demonstration Cities legislation, were especially supportive of Black Power\u2019s genesis and evolution.", "These various programs of the War on Poverty encouraged black political incorporation along the established lines of ethnic patron-clientelism and nurtured a discrete form of bourgeois class politics, one that mobilized and rewarded the most articulate elements of urban communities of color. The Community Action Program sought the \u201cmaximum feasible participation\u201d of the urban black and brown poor in devising solutions to their collective plight. The result was a form of ethnic empowerment that eventually enabled black constituencies to wrest control from white ethnic-dominated governments in many cities, but which also averted a working class-centered politics by institutionalizing the view that racial identity and political constituency were synonymous.", "As it turned out, Black Power militancy and the managerial logic of the Great Society were symbiotic. Figures as diverse as Newark mayor Kenneth Gibson and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale participated in and led anti-poverty programs. The Community Action Agencies provided established black leadership, neighborhood activists, and aspiring politicos with access, resources, and socialization into the world of local public administration. Moynihan later claimed that \u201cthe most important long-run impact\u201d of the Community Action Program was the \u201cformation of an urban Negro leadership echelon at just the time when the Negro masses and other minorities were verging towards extensive commitments to urban politics.\u201d Recalling the quintessential political machine of Gilded Age New York, Moynihan concluded that \u201cTammany at its best (or worse) would have envied the political apprenticeship provided the neighborhood coordinators of the anti-poverty programs.\u201d12 Although Black Power evocations of Third World revolution and armed struggle carried an air of militancy, the real and imagined threat posed by Black Power activists helped to enhance the leverage of more moderate leadership elements, facilitating integration and patronage linkages that delivered to them urban political control and expanded the ranks of the black professional-managerial stratum. The threat of black militancy, either in the form of armed Panther patrols or the phantom black sniper evoked by public authorities amid urban rioting, facilitated elite brokerage dynamics and political integration. Instead of abolishing the conditions of structural unemployment, disinvestment, and hypersegregation that increasingly defined the inner city, Black Power delivered official recognition and elite representation.", "Two of the most influential texts of the period, Harold Cruse\u2019s The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual and Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton\u2019s Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America, both published in 1967, naturalized the rise of Black Power as entailing the black electoral takeover of urban politics by interpreting it in terms of the so-called ethnic framework, which saw the integration of successive waves of immigrants into American life by way of city government and its fruits.13 In his opening chapter, \u201cIndividualism and the Open Society,\u201d Cruse, implicitly adopting a liberal pluralist perspective, argued that American society was essentially organized through various social groups, with \u201cethnic blocs\u201d being the most powerful.14 He claimed that civil rights were a meaningless abstraction outside of the formal, influential political groups that could give them material and practical force. Following this logic, blacks possessed few rights, according to Cruse, because black leadership had failed to act in the nationalistic manner historically pursued by other ethnic groups. Carmichael and Hamilton concluded, in a similar vein, that \u201cgroup solidarity is necessary before a group can operate effectively from a bargaining position of strength in a pluralistic society.\u201d15 Many argue that the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense represented a more revolutionary alternative to this more conservative black ethnic politics, and to a considerable extent it did. But it must be pointed out that the embrace by some Panthers and other black radical organizations of the colonial analogy and other versions of black exceptionalism abided the same logics.", "Organizations like the Black Panther Party fought against police violence, hunger, and slum landlords and mobilized local communities in solidarity with Third World liberation struggles. Creative intellectuals, artists, and musicians affiliated with the Black Arts Movement also unleashed a short-lived urban renaissance in which local black communities dreamed of a world where ghettos were seen not as zones to be escaped and abandoned, but as spaces that might be reborn, giving rise to a popular democratic urbanism not possible under the segregation and exploitation most blacks endured. Unlike the civil rights movement, however, which over the course of decades amassed the resources and popular support needed to wage a successful fight to defeat Jim Crow segregation, Black Power\u2019s radical tendencies attained mass resonance but never achieved truly national popular support for the revolutionary projects they advocated."], "id": "b606f3013a4f1a2cec0c6a6686ef32d9f8b1cc8a5e26283ba031c02d6ec7fb0d", "highlighted_text": " performance evokes revolutionary suicide If the police constituted an \u201coccupying army ,\u201d then liberating would require an equal magnitude of force Despite frequency of demonstrations we are no closer to concrete reform that might curtail violence if we are going to end this crisis current struggles must grow beyond street demonstrations problem resides in nostalgia for Black Power militancy  and black ethnic politics Such is underwritten by vindicationist posture of scholarly writing which preserves emotionally impactful elements but is consumed in ways that forget Black Power\u2019s historical origins and intrinsic limitations . black ethnic politics  falsely equates racial identity with political constituency Black Power militants was also encouraged by liberal statecraft interpretive bias  has no doubt stalled the development of analyses that fully appreciate the complex origins and built-in limitations of Black Power liberals in the Johnson White House were retailing their own version of black empowerment : one that addressed inequality a language of ethno-cultural exceptionalism the Black Panthers\u2019 position on the lumpenproletariat, which cast this substratum as dysfunctional but potentially revolutionary Black and white leftists with ties to the CP built powerful support networks and activist training progra political tendency was eclipsed by the liberal Democratic focus on racial discrimination and the culture of poverty as distinct problems the Johnson administration\u2019s Great Society legislation took care not to upset the lucrative patronage relations between the federal government and private contractors Black Power militancy and the managerial logic of the Great Society were symbiotic Power evocations of Third World revolution and armed struggle helped to enhance the leverage of more moderate leadership elemen ts, facilitating integration and patronage linkages The threat of black militancy facilitated elite brokerage dynamics and political integration .

and a PhD in Religion @Princeton, Democracy in Black: How Race Still Enslaves, p. 185-197, Print)", "body": ["CHANGE HOW WE VIEW GOVERNMENT", "For more than three decades, we have been bludgeoned with an idea of government that has little to no concern for the public good. Big government is bad, we are told. It is inefficient, and its bloated bureaucracies are prone to corruption. Even Democrats, especially since Bill Clinton, have taken up this view. For example, Obama says, \"We don't need big government; we need smart government.\"", "For some on the right, big government is bad because it aims to distribute wealth to those who are lazy and undeserving. \"Big government\" is just a shorthand for dreaded entitlement programs-all too often coded language for race. In this view, \"big government\" is the primary agent of enforcing racial equality, taking hard-earned stuff from white Americans and giving it to undeserving others. Government cannot do such a thing, they argue, without infringing on the rights of white Americans. And even government-mandated redistribution will not solve the problem. As Barry Goldwater put the point in 1964, \"No matter how we try, we cannot pass a law that will make you like me or me like you. The key to racial and religious tolerance lies not in laws alone but, ultimately, in the hearts of men.\" From this perspective, government plays no role in changing our racial habits. Why would we want to make it bigger?", "But Goldwater failed to realize that governmental indifference can harden hearts, and government action can create conditions that soften them. People's attitudes aren't static or untouchable. They are molded by the quality of interactions with others, and one of the great powers of government involves shaping those interactions-not determining them in any concrete sense, but defining the parameters within which people come to know each other and live together. Today, for example, most Americans don't believe women should be confined to the home raising children, or subjected to crude advances and sexist remarks by men. The women's-rights movement put pressure on the government, which in turn passed laws that helped change some of our beliefs about women. Similarly, the relative progress of the 1960s did not happen merely by using the blunt instruments of the law. Change emerged from the ways those laws, with grassroots pressure, created new patterns of interactions, and ultimately new habits. Neither Obama's election to the presidency nor my appointment as a Princeton professor would have happened were it not for these new patterns and habits.", "None of this happens overnight. It takes time and increasing vigilance to protect and secure change. I was talking with a dose friend and he mentioned a basic fact: that we were only fifteen years removed from the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 when Ronald Reagan was elected president and Republicans began to dismantle the gains of the black freedom struggle. Civil rights legislation and the policies of the Great Society had just started to reshape our interactions when they started to be rolled back. We barely had a chance to imagine America anew-to pursue what full employment might look like, to let the abolition of the death penalty settle in, to question seriously the morality of putting people in prison cells, and to enact policies that would undo what the 1968 Kerner Commission described as \"two Americas\" before the attack on \"big government\" or, more precisely, the attack on racial equality was launched. The objective was to shrink the size of government (\"to starve the beast\") and to limit its domestic responsibilities to ensuring economic efficiency and national defense. Democrats eventually buckled, and this is the view of government, no matter who is in office, that we have today. It has become a kind of touchstone of faith among most Americans that government is wasteful and should be limited in its role-that it shouldn't intrude on our lives. Politicians aren't the only ones who hold this view. Many Americans do, too. Now we can't even imagine serious talk of things like full employment or the abolition of prisons.", "We have to change our view of government, especially when it comes to racial matters. Government policy ensured the vote for African Americans and dismantled legal segregation. Policy established a social safety net for the poor and elderly; it put in place the conditions for the growth of our cities. All of this didn't happen simply because of individual will or thanks to some abstract idea of America. It was tied up with our demands and expectations. Goldwater was wrong. So was Reagan. And, in many ways, so is Obama. Our racial habits are shaped by the kind of society in which we live, and our government plays a big role in shaping that society. As young children, our community offers us a way of seeing the world; it lets us know what is valuable and sacred, and what stands as virtuous behavior and what does not. When Michael Brown's body was left in the street for more than four hours, it sent a dear message about the value of black lives. When everything in our society says that we should be less concerned about black folk, that they are dangerous, that no specific policies can address their misery, we say to our children and to everyone else that these people are \"less than\"-that they fall outside of our moral concern. We say, without using the word, that they are niggers.", "One way to change that view is to enact policies that suggest otherwise. Or, to put it another way, to change our view of government, we must change our demands of government. For example, for the past fifty years African American unemployment has been twice that of white unemployment. The 2013 unemployment rate for African Americans stood at 13.1 percent, the highest annual black unemployment rate in more than seventy years. Social scientists do not generally agree on the causes of this trend. Some attribute it to the fact that African Americans are typically the \"last hired and first fired.\" Others point to changes in the nature of the economy; still others point to overt racial discrimination in the labor market. No matter how we account for the numbers, the fact remains that most Americans see double-digit black unemployment as \"normal.\" However, a large-scale, comprehensive jobs agenda with a living wage designed to put Americans, and explicitly African Americans, to work would go a long way toward uprooting the racial habits that inform such a view. It would counter the nonsense that currently stands as a reason for long-term black unemployment in public debate: black folk are lazy and don't want to work.", "If we hold the view that government plays a crucial role in ensuring the public good-if we believe that all Americans, no matter their race or class, can be vital contributors to our beloved community-then we reject the idea that some populations are disposable, that some people can languish in the shadows while the rest of us dance in the light. The question ''Am I my brother's or my sister's keeper?\" is not just a question for the individual or a mantra to motivate the private sector. It is a question answered in the social arrangements that aim to secure the goods and values we most cherish as a community. In other words, we need an idea of government that reflects the value of all Americans, not just white Americans or a few people with a lot of money.", "We need government seriously committed to racial justice. As a nation, we can never pat ourselves on the back about racial matters. We have too much blood on our hands. Remembering that fact-our inheritance, as Wendell Berry said-does not amount to beating ourselves over the head, or wallowing in guilt, or trading in race cards. Remembering our national sins serves as a check and balance against national hubris. We're reminded of what we are capable of, and our eyes are trained to see that ugliness when it rears its head. But when we disremember-when we forget about the horrors of lynching, lose sight of how African Americans were locked into a dual labor market because of explicit racism, or ignore how we exported our racism around the world-we free ourselves from any sense of accountability. Concern for others and a sense of responsibility for the whole no longer matter. Cruelty and indifference become our calling cards.", "We have to isolate those areas in which long-standing trends of racial inequality short-circuit the life chances of African Americans. In addition to a jobs agenda, we need a comprehensive government response to the problems of public education and mass incarceration. And I do mean a government response. Private interests have overrun both areas, as privatization drives school reform (and the education of our children is lost in the boisterous battles between teachers' unions and private interests) and as big business makes enormous profits from the warehousing of black and brown people in prisons. Let's be clear: private interests or market-based strategies will not solve the problems we face as a country or bring about the kind of society we need. We have to push for massive government investment in early childhood education and in shifting the center of gravity of our society from punishment to restorative justice. We can begin to enact the latter reform by putting an end to the practice of jailing children. Full stop. We didn't jail children in the past. We don't need to now.", "In sum, government can help us go a long way toward uprooting racial habits with policies that support jobs with a living wage, which would help wipe out the historic double-digit gap between white and black unemployment; take an expansive approach to early childhood education, which social science research consistently says profoundly affects the life chances of black children; and dismantle the prison-industrial complex. We can no longer believe that disproportionately locking up black men and women constitutes an answer to social ills.", "This view of government cannot be dismissed as a naive pipe dream, because political considerations relentlessly attack our political imaginations and limit us to the status quo. We are told before we even open our mouths that this particular view won't work or that it will never see the light of day. We've heard enough of that around single payer health care reform and other progressive policies over the Obama years. Such defeatist attitudes conspire to limit our imaginations and make sure that the world stays as it is. But those of us who don't give a damn about the rules of the current political game must courageously organize, advocate, and insist on the moral and political significance of a more robust role for government. We have to change the terms of political debate.", "Something dramatic has to happen. American democracy has to be remade. John Dewey, the American philosopher, understood this:", "The very idea of democracy, the meaning of democracy, must be continually explored afresh; it has to be constantly discovered and rediscovered, remade and reorganized; while the political and economic and social institutions in which it is embodied have to be remade and reorganized to meet the changes that are going on in the development of new needs on the part of human beings and new resources for satisfying these needs.", "Dewey saw American democracy as an unfinished project. He knew that the aims and purposes of this country were not fixed forever in the founding documents, but the particular challenges of our moment required imaginative leaps on behalf of democracy itself. Otherwise, undemocratic forces might prevail; tyranny in the form of the almighty dollar and the relentless pursuit of it might overtake any commitment to the idea of the public good; and bad habits might diminish our moral imaginations.", "The remaking of America will not happen inside the Beltway. Too many there have too much invested in the status quo. A more robust idea of government will not emerge from the current political parties. Both are beholden to big money. Substantive change will have to come from us. Or, as the great civil rights leader Ella Baker said, \"we are the leaders we've been looking for\"-a model of leadership that scares the hell out of the Reverena Sharpton. We will have to challenge the status quo in the streets and at the ballot box. In short, it will take a full-blown democratic awakening to enact this revolution.", "Ethical commitment requires relentless self-criticism and dialectics ", "Griffin, PhD Candidate, 16", "(Thabisile, , 3-7)*A-ARP=All-African People\u2019s Revolutionary Party", "A decade on, what most resonates from my experiences in the A-APRP is the organization\u2019s commitment to constant study and criticism. Our organizing was always fueled by our reading list and discussions, which were crucial to our understanding of systems of oppression and how we might dismantle them. Reading was central to the revolution: it was not an extension of bourgeois university labor, but a critical way of acquiring tools for effective action. Collective and self-criticism were also paramount. The members of our work-study group ranged in age from eighteen to thirty, with folk from different classes, regions, and backgrounds. Needless to say, there was conflict. Meetings would end with efforts toward constructive criticism, both of self and of the collective. In the often-complicated organizing toward freedom, the conflict and contradictions proved to be perhaps the most generative. It was through these uncomfortable frictions that we came to understand the vital role of dialectics. Studying and discussing led to indispensible debates about how to conceptualize and create freedom. I would suggest that dialectics is still how we need to seek answers, within and beyond the university. Although neoliberal logic would lead us to believe otherwise, there is no fundamental divide between scholars and \u201cthe street.\u201d This belief is inaccurate and destructive; we both affect and are affected by each other. Many of us are from the streets and return there with each birthday and funeral, and many of us still call it home. The intellectual relationship between academics and non-academics serves as another type of integral exchange, and ushers in more of a critical dialectic. In the academy, the access students have to particular types of resources comes with the great responsibility of building on existing discourses in new and emancipatory ways\u2014for all of humanity. In his essay, Kelley reminds us that students\u2019 efforts at self-radicalization are nothing new, and such struggles are often both complicated and beautiful. He evokes the mantra of \u201clove, study, struggle\u201d as a fundamental guideline for our spaces. To struggle outside of institutional constraints, to study rigorously, and to practice a collective love that engulfs individualized fear and trauma. Enslaved people in the Americas did not find themselves fixed in the muddy vestiges of trauma and destruction; instead, they created explosive and beautiful means toward freedom. Kelley reminds us that it is our duty to do so as well. At UCLA\u2014but not affiliated with the university\u2014we founded a group called The Undercommons in January of 2016. It is a freedom school that challenges and contests not just the legitimacy of the university, but the violence of the state. The Undercommons operates horizontally, lovingly and collectively, to disrupt the professional hierarchy that is endemic to the university system, and toxic to learning spaces. Our weekly sessions strive against neoliberal competitiveness and reaffirm the capacity of anyone\u2014community members, faculty, graduate students, undergraduates, anyone\u2014to teach, learn, and study. However most importantly, as we respond to university and state violence, we also are creating beloved community, and eventually an international community. We seek to create the world we want to live in. The Undercommons is a celebration of insurrection, struggle, and love. We are a group of dedicated students descended from a long line of living, struggling, and laughing people.

The difference speaks directly to the racial disparities that define American criminal justice, but it is worth noting that the rate at which white people in the United States are incarcerated is still higher than the incarceration rates of almost every other country in the world.33 It\u2019s also unquestionable that Blacks and Latino/as experience death at the hands of police at much greater rates than whites, but thousands of white people have also been murdered by the police.

Why do many Black Caribbean and African immigrant workers think that Black Americans are lazy? Why do most American workers of all ethnicities accept racist ideas about Arabs and Muslims?

Capitalism creates false scarcity, the perception that need outstrips resources. When billions are spent on war, police-brutality settlements, and publicly subsidized sports stadiums, there never seems to be a shortage of money. But when it comes to schools, housing, food, and other basic necessities, politicians always complain about deficits and the need to curb spending and cut budgets. The scarcity is manufactured, but the competition over these resources is real. People who are forced to fight over basic necessities are often willing to believe the worst about other workers to justify why they should have something while others should not.", "The prevailing ideology in a given society consists of the ideas that influence how we understand the world and help us make sense of our lives\u2014through news, entertainment, education, and more. The political and economic elite shape the ideological world we all live in, to their benefit. We live in a thoroughly racist society, so it should not be surprising that people have racist ideas. The more important question is under what circumstances those ideas can change. There is a clash between the prevailing ideology in society and people\u2019s lived experience. The media may inundate the public with constant images and news stories that describe Blacks as criminals or on welfare, but an individual\u2019s experience with Blacks at work may completely contradict the stereotype\u2014hence the insistence from many whites that they are not racist because they \u201cknow Black people.\u201d It can be true in that person\u2019s mind.

The development of consciousness is never linear\u2014it is constantly fluctuating between adhering to ideas that fit a \u201ccommon sense\u201d conception of society and being destabilized by real-life events that upend \u201ccommon sense.\u201d The Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci explains the phenomenon of mixed consciousness this way:", "The active man-in-the-mass has a practical activity but has no clear theoretical consciousness of his practical activity which nonetheless involves understanding the world in so far as it transforms it. His theoretical consciousness can . . . be historically in opposition to his activity. One might almost say that he has two theoretical consciousness[es] (or one contradictory consciousness): one which is implicit in his activity and which in reality unites him with all fellow workers in the practical transformation of the real world; and one superficially explicit or verbal, which he has inherited from the past and uncritically absorbed. The person is strangely composite: it contains Stone Age elements and principles of a more advanced science, prejudices of all past phases of history at the local level and intuitions of a future philosophy which will be that of a human race united the world over.35", "Whether or not a group of workers has reactionary, mixed, or even revolutionary consciousness does not change its objective status as exploited and oppressed labor. The achievement of consciousness is the difference between the working class being a class in itself as opposed to a class for itself. It affects whether or not workers are in a position to fundamentally alter their reality through collective action. As one writer observed, \u201cOnly a collective can develop a systematic alternative world view, can overcome to some degree the alienation of manual and mental work that imposes on everyone, on workers and intellectuals alike, a partial and fragmented view of reality.\u201d36", "Just because white workers, to take a specific example, may at times fully accept reactionary ideas about African Americans does not change the objective fact that the majority of the US poor are white, the majority of people without health insurance are white, and the majority of the homeless are white. It is true that Blacks and Latino/as are disproportionately affected by the country\u2019s harsh economic order, but this is a reality they share with the majority of white workers. The common experience of oppression and exploitation creates the potential for a united struggle to better the conditions of all. This is obviously not an automatic process, nor is it a given that essentially economic struggles will translate to support or struggle for the political rights of Blacks to be free of discrimination and racism. Political unity, including winning white workers to the centrality of racism in shaping the lived experiences of Black and Latino/a workers, is key to their own liberation.", "Tim Wise\u2019s observations reduce these real issues to an abstract accusation of \u201cprivileging\u201d class over race. But our movement has to have theoretical, political, and strategic clarity to confront challenges in the real world. When, in 2012, Chicago\u2019s Black public school CEO Barbara Byrd Bennett was scheming with mayor Rahm Emanuel to close more than fifty schools located exclusively in Black and Latino/a neighborhoods, should Black teachers, students, and parents have united with Bennett, who has certainly experienced racism and sexism in her life and career, but who was also leading the charge to undo public education in Chicago? Or should they have united with the thousands of white teachers in Chicago schools and the vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union, a white, heterosexual man, to build the movement to save public education in the city?", "Probably very few people in history have had as much racist invective directed at them as Barack Obama has\u2014hating him is basically shorthand for racism now. But he has also championed policies that absolved the banks and Wall Street of any responsibility for crashing the economy; as a result, since 2007 ten million people have been displaced from more than four million homes by the foreclosure crisis.37 Should Black workers put that aside and unite with Obama out of racial solidarity and a shared \u201clived experience,\u201d or should they unite with ordinary whites and Latino/as who have also lost their homes to challenge a political program that regularly defends business interests to the detriment of all working-class and poor people? In the abstract, perhaps these are complicated questions. But in the daily struggles to defend public education, fight for real healthcare reform, or stop predatory foreclosures, these are the concrete questions every movement faces.", "The \u201cblind spot\u201d of class within the framework of people like Tim Wise not only leaves them incapable of explaining class division among the oppressed, it also underemphasizes the material foundation for solidarity and unity within the working class. Instead, the concepts of solidarity and unity are reduced to whether or not one chooses to be an \u201cally.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with being an ally, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture the degree to which Black and white workers are inextricably linked. It\u2019s not as if white workers can simply choose not to \u201cally\u201d with Black workers to no peril of their own. The scale of attack on the living standards of the working class is overwhelming. There is a systematic, bipartisan effort to dismantle the already anemic welfare state. When, in 2013, $5 billion cut was cut from food stamps, it had a direct and deleterious impact on the lives of tens of millions of white working-class people.", "In this context, solidarity is not just an option; it is crucial to workers\u2019 ability to resist the constant degradation of their living standards. Solidarity is only possible through relentless struggle to win white workers to antiracism, to expose the lie that Black workers are worse off because they somehow choose to be, and to win the white working class to the understanding that, unless they struggle, they too will continue to live lives of poverty and frustration, even if those lives are somewhat better than the lives led by Black workers. Success or failure are contingent on whether or not working people see themselves as brothers and sisters whose liberation is inextricably bound together.", "Solidarity is standing in unity with people even when you have not personally experienced their particular oppression, The reality is that as long as capitalism exists, material and ideological pressures push white workers to be racist and all workers to hold each other in general suspicion. But there are moments of struggle when the mutual interests of workers are laid bare, and when the suspicion is finally turned in the other direction\u2014at the plutocrats who live well while the rest of us suffer. The key question is whether or not in those moments of struggle a coherent political analysis of society, oppression, and exploitation can be articulated that makes sense of the world we live in, but that also champions the vision of a different kind of society\u2014and a way to get there.", "Democratic faith discloses alternatives to anti-blackness \u2013 democratic faith in renewal gives life meaning.", "Melvin ROGERS Poli Sci @ Brown \u201918 \u201cDelany, Douglass, and the Danger of Political Pessimism\u201d  Transcribed by Victor Wu & John Turner 0:05 \u2013 12:38", "In Dark Water of 1920, W.E.B. DuBois offers an incisive commentary on the meaning of democracy. \u201cAgainst those who would restrict the franchise,\u201d he remarks, quote, \u201cSuch arguments show so curious a misapprehension of the foundation of the argument for democracy, that the argument must be continually restated and emphasized,\u201d says DuBois. The statement is arresting, given the historical setting these words were penned, by an African American in the 1920s at a time when the insecurity of black life, the insecurity of black life was constantly on display \u2013 a period in which despite the Civil War amendments, Jim and Jane Crow were the law of the land and lynching was a daily reminder of how easily one could be disposed of with impunity. That the case for democracy must be restated amid its distorted expression raises an important question that I think haunts the struggle for racial equality, and indeed the very legitimacy of the American polity. What is it about democracy that justifies our faith, especially the faith of African Americans in it? Given the frequency with which African Americans are killed by police, the ongoing problems of economic inequality they experience, and the general sense that from city to city and state to state black people are subject to a fundamental insecurity not chiefly of their own making, it is difficult to suggest that commitment is or has been justified at all. It may seem more appropriate to interpret the United States as working according to plan, connecting the horror of the earliest periods of African-American life to the present moment and one story about the nation\u2019s presumed foundational commitment to antiblackness.", "Writing, for example, in response to the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates describes Martin\u2019s killing as the natural consequence of the functioning of American society. This is what Coates writes: \u201cWhen you have a society that takes as its founding the hatred and degradation of a people, when the society inscribes the degradation in its most hallowed document and continues to inscribe hatred in its laws and policies, it is fantastic to believe that its citizens will derive no ill messaging. It is painful to say this: Trayvon Martin is not a miscarriage of justice, but of American justice itself. This is not our system malfunctioning, this is our system working as intended.\u201d End quote.", "You just gotta sit with that for a minute, right? Little can be denied, in this, I think, and we might add other voices who are trying to get us to see that antiblackness functions as a precondition for American progress. As philosopher Calvin Warren tells us, quote, \u201cIt is the humiliated, incarcerated, mutilated, and terrorized black body that serves as the vestibule for the democracy to come.\u201d End quote. Warren stands in a tradition of thinking known as afro-pessimism, that includes scholars such as Jared Sexton and Frank Wilderson and I think more recently Christina Sharpe, all view the persistence of racial inequality and the vulnerability of black life as the inescapable afterlife of slavery. They raise the haunting suggestion that modernity, by which is meant that period running roughly from the Glorious Revolution to the American and French Revolutions, that modernity specifies what they call an ontology \u2013 that requires a referent outside itself for its conceptualization of identity, freedom, and progress, that requires an Other for freedom, equality, and progress to be realized. This ontological framework in which African Americans work, live, and struggle leads, as Juliet Hooker and Barnor Hess tell us, to a fundamental conundrum. This is their words, quote \u201cOne of the fundamental paradoxes of black politics is the invariable futility of directing activism towards a racially governing regime, historically founded on the constitutive exclusion and violation of blackness.\u201d End quote.", "Now, it is fashionable these days, and understandably so, to wear one\u2019s despair on one\u2019s sleeve. If we are honest with ourselves, if we are honest, how could we do otherwise? Moments of hope have often been dashed by the cold and cruel reality of American life. It is no wonder we find it hard to stabilize our faith in a racially just society. Here in brief is the sample of this history: In the wake of black American\u2019s participation in the American Revolution, the nation witnessed a slow denial of their standing and contribution to the polity. With the ongoing development of slavery in the South, northern states in the 19th century slowly rescinded rights that had previously been extended to African American, African American men. Although the Civil War amendments sought to recognize the equal status of blacks, that recognition was effectively denied by the ascendancy of debt peonage, economic exploitation, lynching, and Jim and Jane Crow. The civil rights movement killed Jim and Jane Crow, but the policing and subordination of blacks was reconstituted through the rise of the carceral state, the underdeveloped welfare state, and the underfunded public education system that has been exacerbated by residential segregation. Whatever one might think of his success, the fact remains that the election of the first black president has been followed by Donald Trump, who defines his success based on removing any trace of its previous occupant. Trump\u2019s success was, without exaggeration, cultivated through the tropes of white supremacy nativism and the commitment to police black and brown populations. Claims of white supremacy\u2019s death of the post-racialism supposedly evidenced by the ascendancy of Barack Obama to the presidency have proven premature, yes?", "At precisely this moment, however, we must confront some crucial questions. Is American democracy constitutionally at odds with our goals, or might it be conducive to building a society in which we all can live equally and at peace with one another? Are there normative resources on which one can rely to advance affirmative claims regarding racial equality, resources that are distilled not by, not by denying the ontology specified above, but by disclosing its competing alternative? Or must the resources of modern democracy remain forever premised on anti-blackness?", "Admittedly, these appear to be empirical questions that depend on history. Or do they? In our historical calculus, we might emphasize the reconstitution of white supremacy. But we could just as easily emphasize the ways in which it has been foiled through multiple waves of racial inclusion. Those who embrace the former as our true racial reality find themselves trying to prove to those of us who have benefited from racial struggle why our success is illusory or at best temporary. But those who locate America\u2019s identity in its resistance to white supremacy have another problem. They are often unable to see the evidence of systemic racism, or they readily describe it as anomalous foreign to the structure of our institutions and culture. If the first position seems unsatisfying because it denies human agency and gives the past too much power over the present and future, the second risks turning a blind eye to the ways white supremacy is often bolstered by institutional support and state-sanctioned violence that emanate from a culture that disregards again and again black life.", "Both sides, I think, fail to distinguish between the somewhat different task of studying the past and narrativizing the past in a way that is useful for moving society in an auspicious direction, and Frederick Douglass\u2019s felicitous formulation of the matter, quote \u201cWe have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future.\u201d End quote.", "These words come from Douglass\u2019s famous 1852 address, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d And in that address he does not dismiss the past, rather he stands in a line of thinkers who see in America\u2019s past a vital principle that is both visionary and realistic. Similar to early 19th century abolitionist David Walker before him and James Baldwin well after him, Douglass deploys the principle of making and remaking that underwrites the American polity what we political theorists call the constituent power of the people that is part and parcel of the central properties of democracy. The idea of the people, Douglass knows all too well, form part of the tradition of American life, sitting alongside and often used to combat the white supremacist tendencies of the American polity. And Douglass, I think, retrieves this principle from the past and he counsels his fellows to place it in the service of the present and the future.", "Now, for Douglass, African-Americans may often be alienated from American society, but they are not alien to it. This point is of great significance when you consider the thread running through much of African American thinking as struggle, that seeks to make America racially just polity. They see their efforts emerging from within and forming part of the very complex traditions of America\u2019s moral and political language. Like them, Douglass\u2019s aim is to emphasize those portions of the tradition that might yet deepen and extend democracy against those portions that will constrain democracy\u2019s meaning and reach. The meaning of America, its past, and its future, is, for Douglass, something over which to struggle. But he sees struggle as an emergent property of the contested notion of who comprises the people that is central to democracy\u2019s self-understanding.", "So the question of what America really is, it seems to me, defies articulation even as we struggle to say something substantive about our ethical and political identities. This is simply because we cannot get on with figuring out where we should go and who we ought to be without narrating in the past to which we belong. But worry and I think too much about offering the true description or final narrative of that past may miss the point. We ask questions of the past, \u201cWho are we really?\u201d less to understand our identity once and for all, and more to aid in us making decisions about who we should become. This is the aspirational quality of the American imagination, indeed the aspirational core on which African Americans have often relied to make sense of their appeals to the nation. This is, as I believe, the perfectionist or romantic register on which many in this tradition have often worked, including Douglass himself.", "So for the remainder of my remarks, I want to spend some time trying to retrieve the meaning and complex power of this aspirational vision. Believing that it is during moments of dark times, such as our current moment (at least for me, I think) that we need to recall the faith of those that came before. But just as we have in our current moment powerful reasons to lose faith and powerful reasons to believe in what the afro-pessimists offer us, Douglass had in his time a powerful alternative vision confronting his own, it\u2019s with that vision we must now begin."], "id": "dd4dea0a9c24aebfc35d7edda2264ee9d468eca1d7e3ee5c633d0982569f8c8c", "highlighted_text": " African Americans suffer the blunt force trauma of criminal justice but pervasive character means whites get caught up racial disparities define criminal justice, but white people are still higher than incarceration of almost every country Blacks and Latino/as experience death at greater rates but thousands of white people have been murdered This does not mean experiences are equal, but there is a basis for solidarity  Obama absolved banks ten million have been displaced by foreclosure Should Black workers unite with Obama out of racial solidarity or whites and Latino/as who also lost their homes to challenge business interests in daily struggles  to defend education fight for healthcare or stop foreclosures, these are concrete questions every movement faces being an ally doesn\u2019t capture the degree to which workers are inextricably linked .

technology that could cool the planet\u2014quickly and cheaply\u2014by continually spraying megatons of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere to reflect some incoming solar radiation back to space. In climate policy, solar geoengineering has long been considered fringe, at best a last-ditch \u201cplan B\u201d in the event of a climate emergency. But recent activity around the technology compels a shift in perspective: solar geoengineering is not a futuristic \u201cplan B,\u201d but a rapidly developing pillar of capital\u2019s climate \u201cplan A.\u201d Solar geoengineering is receiving renewed discussion because of brief mention in the House Select Committee\u2019s Climate Action Plan. The plan recommends following guidance from the National Academies of Sciences\u2019 forthcoming report on \u201creflecting sunlight to cool earth\u201d (two briefings from this committee were released in June). Other recent moves include steps taken by the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program (HSGRP) to advance outdoor SAI field-experiments, Congressional appropriation of $4 million to NOAA to support federal solar geoengineering research, and release of a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists endorsing cautious research. In the midst of rising emissions and climate inaction, many scientists and policymakers are coming to the conclusion that cheap, fast-acting technologies require research and investment. Moreover, a budding consensus is emerging around key norms and best-case scenarios: solar geoengineering research should proceed cautiously, cooperatively, and transparently. Governance should be internationally coordinated and include input from publics and civil society, particularly from the Global South. If deployed, it should be gradual, moderate, and temporary, with the aim of \u201cbuying time\u201d for emissions cuts, and providing \u201chumanitarian\u201d relief to those vulnerable to near-term climate risks. This is powerful narrative. Yet, even if such extremely optimistic scenarios were to obtain\u2014a highly dubious prospect\u2014solar geoengineering would remain antithetical to ecosocialism and to a radical GND. There are four key reasons for this: the research is largely funded by billionaires and wealthy philanthropic organizations with ties to finance and technology capital; solar geoengineering is being designed to \u201cbuy time\u201d for market-driven decarbonization (to explicitly avoid revolutionary change); the \u201chumanitarian\u201d discourse around the technology represents a form of technocratic, liberal paternalism; and, as states will have ultimate control over deployment, the prospect of militarization cannot be ruled out"], "id": "55d41acfb218afdad1519fbd12e1702126023b59e4b6a23ff6c453bf5f67bcc6", "highlighted_text": " geoengineering has long been considered fringe last-ditch \u201cplan B geoengineering would remain antithetical to ecosocialism and to a radical GND four key reasons the research is funded by billionaires geoengineering is designed to \u201cbuy time\u201d for decarbonization the discourse represents technocratic, liberal paternalism states will have control militarization cannot be ruled out", "highlights": [[3, 314, 360], [3, 372, 390], [3, 2092, 2135], [3, 2136, 2169], [3, 2181, 2197], [3, 2208, 2223], [3, 2232, 2254], [3, 2346, 2363], [3, 2370, 2396], [3, 2411, 2426], [3, 2471, 2474], [3, 2490, 2499], [3, 2522, 2532], [3, 2543, 2576], [3, 2586, 2602], [3, 2612, 2619], [3, 2653, 2674], [3, 2675, 2687]], "underlines": [[3, 314, 360], [3, 360, 361], [3, 370, 371], [3, 372, 390], [3, 390, 391], [3, 429, 448], [3, 471, 501], [3, 509, 551], [3, 554, 588], [3, 589, 616], [3, 616, 616], [3, 2001, 2008], [3, 2014, 2044], [3, 2092, 2135], [3, 2136, 2169], [3, 2181, 2197], [3, 2208, 2223], [3, 2224, 2231], [3, 2232, 2254], [3, 2346, 2363], [3, 2364, 2369], [3, 2370, 2396], [3, 2397, 2410], [3, 2411, 2426], [3, 2471, 2474], [3, 2475, 2489], [3, 2490, 2499], [3, 2500, 2521], [3, 2522, 2532], [3, 2533, 2542], [3, 2543, 2576], [3, 2583, 2585], [3, 2586, 2602], [3, 2603, 2611], [3, 2612, 2619], [3, 2620, 2649], [3, 2650, 2652], [3, 2653, 2674], [3, 2675, 2687]], "emphasis": [[3, 589, 616], [3, 616, 616], [3, 2136, 2169], [3, 2543, 2576], [3, 2650, 2652], [3, 2653, 2674]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 17]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-01"}, {"tag": "K", "cite": "Adom GETACHEW Poli Sci @ Chicago \u201916 \u201cUniversalism After the Post-colonial Turn: Interpreting the Haitian Revolution\u201d Political Theory 44 (6) p. 835-837", "body": ["Racial hierarchy was also the target in Article 14 of the constitution, which abolished \u201call distinctions of color\u201d and declared \u201cHaitians shall be known from now on by the generic denomination of blacks.\u201d76 Prior to its independence, Haiti was governed by a taxonomy of race that identified more than a hundred categories of racial difference, which organized free and enslaved people of color hierarchically. By abolishing this hierarchy, the constitution hoped to overcome the racial distinctions that had facilitated colonial slavery. Moreover, by elevating blackness into the general category to which all Haitians belonged, the racial category once located at the bottom of the colonial hierarchy was resignified.77 It would be freed from its historical association with slavery and celebrated as the marker of citizenship.", "In highlighting the effort to institutionalize individual and collective autonomy, I have called attention to precisely those elements of Haitian independence in 1804 that Buck-Morss finds to be anti-universal. The prohibitions against white property owners and the renaming of all citizens as black appear to be exclusionary, while the appeal to Empire suggests a mimicry of the imperial ambitions that characterized European states of the time. There are reasons to doubt this reading, however. Take for instance the exclusion of white property owners in Article 12 of the 1805 constitution. In the subsequent article, naturalized white women who were married to Haitians, as well as Germans, Poles, and their descendants are exempted from the prohibition on property ownership.78 The redescription of all Haitians as black requires rethinking in light of this exemption. It cannot be read as an exclusionary measure that reduced citizenship to a nativist or racialist entitlement. Blackness was reconceived as a political category that signaled \u201chistorical or potential resistance\u201d to slavery and colonial domination.79 It was the contributions of Germans and Poles to the revolutionary war that allowed them to become Haitian citizens and therefore black.", "This redefinition of blackness also made it possible to extend Haitian citizenship beyond its territorial confines. Revolutionary leaders acknowledged that ending slavery and creating the first black nation-state were not local events but would have reverberations throughout the Atlantic world. Even before independence and as the transatlantic slave trade continued, Toussaint planned to set free all Africans who landed in Haiti. Moreover, he outlined plans to sail to Africa in an effort to end the slave trade and extend freedom and French nationality to millions.80 Like Toussaint, Dessalines projected the universalism of the Haitian Revolution. Linking his victory over France in Haiti to the salvation of the entire Western Hemisphere, he proclaimed, \u201cI have saved my country; I have avenged America.\u201d81 He indicated that this link would be realized by spreading the revolution against slavery and colonial rule throughout the Atlantic world.82", "While Toussaint\u2019s and Dessalines\u2019s early aims of exporting the revolution through military expansion were not feasible, their successors sought to make Haiti a refuge for slaves and colonial subjects throughout the Americas. As Ada Ferrer notes, in the 1810s, Haitian vessels stopped slave ships, freeing the slaves and providing them rights of residency in Haiti.83 Moreover, Sybille Fischer documents how the 1816 constitution of the southern republic constitutionally guaranteed the right of asylum to \u201call Africans and Indians, and those of their blood\u201d and promised naturalization after a year of residency.84 This constitutional clause established Haiti as \u201ca free soil\u201d territory where slaves and colonial subjects from across the region could be free and gain citizenship. 85 With the reunification of the north and south in 1820, this asylum provision was extended to the entire country and led to an increase in the number of fugitive slaves requesting asylum.86", "These provisions of asylum suggested that while the claim \u201call Haitians are black\u201d could not be reversed to read \u201call blacks are Haitians,\u201d the Haitian state opened up the possibility for all blacks in the region to become Haitian.87 Unlike the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, which made an abstract claim that \u201call men are born free and equal in rights,\u201d the early Haitian constitutions tied freedom to the territory of Haiti where slavery was concretely abolished. The asylum clause made this concrete freedom accessible to those that lived beyond its borders. The \u201cterritory without slavery [was] now expressly and legally available to outsiders, to slaves of foreign masters, subjects of foreign kings, and outcasts of other governments.\u201d88 Of those who took advantage of asylum in Haiti were about six to thirteen thousand African Americans. Haitian citizenship was thus transnational and promised autonomy to those who were denied even the smallest modicum of liberty and independence throughout the Americas.89", "The asylum provision not only made possible transnational citizenship but also afforded Haiti a way of expanding its anti-slavery and anti-colonial project beyond its territorial confines. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and his generals were twice granted exile during their efforts to liberate Venezuela. Moreover, Alexandre P\u00e9tion, the president of the southern republic, provided ammunitions and soldiers to Bol\u00edvar on two conditions: that he emancipate all slaves in liberated territories and that all captive Africans taken from slave ships be turned over to Haiti where they would qualify for citizenship.90 These conditions allowed P\u00e9tion to continue the project of avenging America by spreading emancipation and independence beyond Haiti\u2019s territorial boundaries and securing citizenship for the formerly enslaved who were denied membership elsewhere."], "id": "00ef4a8e75f88b010bdefc79fd011fe85b70f9413229f2ecb2ecbf18b85fe27c", "highlighted_text": " by elevating blackness into the general category the racial category once located at the bottom of the hierarchy was resignified It would be freed from its association with slavery and celebrated as citizenshi p Blackness was reconceived as a political category that signaled resistance\u201d to slavery and colonial domination .

This has special salience in postcolonial theory, where the question of whether the nation-state is the necessary objective of anticolonial struggles against the rule of European colonial empires is paramount. Of course, this tension between postnational forms of association and the nation-state as the necessary vehicle of anticolonial liberation is nothing new. As Leela Gandhi has productively explored, this tension between postnational solidarities and anticolonial nationalism is a defining feature of postcolonial theory.2 Yet evident in the pioneering work of scholars like Frederick Cooper and Gary Wilder, who have uncovered critiques of the nation-state as the primary vehicle of decolonization and calls for federative alternatives to empire in twentieth-century anticolonial politics, the pendulum has undoubtedly swung toward postnationalism.3", "Adom Getachew's pathbreaking book, Worldmaking After Empire, both contributes to yet fundamentally challenges the terms of these debates.4 Where previous scholars have seemingly posed anticolonial nationalism and postnational solidarity as mutually exclusive, incompatible alternatives, Getachew provocatively argues that anticolonial nationalists like W. E. B. Du Bois, George Padmore, Eric Williams, Kwame Nkrumah, and Julius Nyerere, among others, did not outright reject the nation-state in their quest for self-determination. Instead, they internationalized the nation-state through the construction of new constituted powers that linked national sovereignties together in global juridical, political, and economic bodies. Specifically, Getachew explores how these anticolonial nationalists pursued self-determination not simply through national independence, but by constructing new international institutions such as the right of self-determination, regional federations in the West Indies and Africa, and the New International Economic Order (NIEO).", "Central to Getachew's account is a redefinition of empire as a global network of power marked by unequal international integration and racialized hierarchy. Rather than a dyadic relationship between colonizer and colonized, empire represents an inter-imperial order marked by European domination over the non-European world. In this conceptual redefinition, Getachew reveals how slavery was not simply a metaphor for imperial domination. Rather, political thinkers like Du Bois, James, and Williams developed a thoroughgoing critique of \u201cempire as enslavement\u201d in which twentieth-century colonialism was an extension of modern racial slavery by other means (78\u201379). Just as plantation slavery morphed into colonial imperialism, international hierarchies would continue after formal decolonization in the guise of neocolonialism if self-determination was not envisioned as something more than freedom from the interference of alien rule. Without addressing the despotic and arbitrary power of the inter-imperial system, which persisted in informal economic relations, the racial hierarchies of international order would persist.", "Within this distinct understanding of empire resides Getachew's central innovation, a notion self-determination understood as freedom as nondomination. For neorepublican political theorists like Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner, freedom properly understood is a form of nondomination rather than noninterference. While noninterference implies that one is free insofar as they do not face external coercion or constraint in their choices, nondomination suggests that an individual can be unfree even in the absence of overt constraint and coercion. For Getachew, the paradigmatic case of slavery as domination captures something essential about the modern imperial order, which significantly complicates the pursuit of freedom as self-determination through national independence. While a former colony may attain national independence and end formal imperial control, a condition of domination in the international order persists as a result of entrenched racial, political, and economic hierarchies that disproportionately distribute rights and obligations.", "From this perspective, the revolutionary nature of anticolonial worldmaking was the radical rupture it posed, not in the authority of singular imperial formations (e.g., the British or French empires), but in the European-dominated, inter-imperial order marked by entrenched racial and colonial hierarchies. As Getachew puts it, European imperialism was \u201citself a world-constituting force that violently inaugurated an unprecedented era of globality\u201d (3). As such, the attainment of nation-state sovereignty alone was insufficient to secure nondomination. What was needed was the reconstruction of international order. Getachew writes, \u201cThus the worldmaking of decolonization should be understood as an internationalism of the nation-state\u201d (25). For these anticolonial nationalists, colonial peoples could not simply be included into an already constituted international society. Rather, global order would need to be remade if they were to secure freedom as nondomination.", "What is so compelling about Getachew's account is the way she traces how these figures refused the binary choice between national sovereignty and postnational solidarity. To be sure, anticolonial nationalism was necessarily \u201cbound to the institutional form of the nation-state\u201d (25). But anticolonial nationalists rejected the premise that national independence could be realized without post-national institutions. In this way, they did not so much move \u201cbeyond the nation-state\u201d as they did reside in the interstices between nation and world. In what remains of this essay, I want to pose an interrelated set of questions that stem directly from these conceptions of decolonization as worldmaking and the internationalization of the nation-state, but that also move beyond Getachew's immediate concerns. In posing these questions, I do not intend to expose limitations of her already comprehensive account. Rather, I hope to demonstrate the richness of her analysis by pointing to a set of questions for further research."], "id": "f640c7c9da38f96df2bfc72b8a71b604329ffc5e125fdf905121994dffe79e0a", "highlighted_text": " we live in an age of \u201cpostnational constellations that require moving beyond the nation-state Du Bois internationalized the nation-state  through new constituted powers  that linked national sovereignties together these anticolonial nationalists pursued self-determination not through national independence, but constructing new international institutions such as self-determination, and the NIEO Rather than a dyadic relationship empire represents an inter-imperial order marked by domination over the non-European world colonialism was an extension of racial slavery by other means self-determination understood as freedom as nondomination rather than noninterference an individual can be unfree even in the absence of overt coercion decolonization should be understood as internationalism of the nation-state these refused the binary choice between sovereignty and postnational solidarity", "highlights": [[3, 80, 129], [3, 140, 183], [4, 362, 369], [4, 545, 579], [4, 579, 579], [4, 580, 587], [4, 608, 630], [4, 630, 630], [4, 631, 674], [4, 764, 826], [4, 834, 868], [4, 872, 923], [4, 937, 956], [4, 1009, 1016], [4, 1051, 1055], [5, 157, 190], [5, 224, 275], [5, 285, 323], [5, 588, 619], [5, 627, 656], [6, 93, 150], [6, 285, 312], [6, 467, 523], [6, 539, 547], [7, 661, 699], [7, 703, 739], [8, 73, 78], [8, 87, 120], [8, 130, 169]], "underlines": [[3, 0, 13], [3, 37, 41], [3, 68, 79], [3, 80, 129], [3, 140, 183], [3, 257, 336], [3, 368, 374], [3, 379, 422], [4, 145, 285], [4, 287, 295], [4, 310, 361], [4, 362, 369], [4, 378, 385], [4, 392, 400], [4, 408, 415], [4, 428, 435], [4, 451, 530], [4, 538, 544], [4, 545, 579], [4, 580, 587], [4, 588, 607], [4, 608, 630], [4, 631, 674], [4, 675, 726], [4, 764, 826], [4, 827, 833], [4, 834, 868], [4, 869, 871], [4, 872, 923], [4, 924, 936], [4, 937, 956], [4, 957, 1008], [4, 1009, 1016], [4, 1051, 1055], [5, 0, 7], [5, 30, 155], [5, 157, 190], [5, 191, 222], [5, 224, 275], [5, 276, 284], [5, 285, 323], [5, 328, 356], [5, 379, 436], [5, 446, 587], [5, 588, 619], [5, 620, 626], [5, 627, 656], [5, 937, 1127], [6, 0, 52], [6, 53, 92], [6, 93, 150], [6, 150, 151], [6, 230, 237], [6, 258, 260], [6, 271, 284], [6, 285, 312], [6, 320, 335], [6, 336, 343], [6, 349, 437], [6, 439, 466], [6, 467, 523], [6, 524, 538], [6, 539, 547], [6, 563, 670], [7, 23, 306], [7, 329, 449], [7, 556, 617], [7, 642, 660], [7, 661, 699], [7, 700, 702], [7, 703, 739], [7, 747, 973], [8, 73, 78], [8, 79, 86], [8, 87, 120], [8, 121, 129], [8, 130, 169], [8, 183, 276], [8, 284, 287], [8, 314, 414], [8, 484, 488], [8, 493, 543]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[5, 9], [35, 38]], "filename": "neg-4.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-01"}, {"tag": "A vision for a different order is vital.

Self-determination as worldmaking and nation-building and the postcolonial state imagined as the agent of international and domestic transformation were central to building a world after empire. As the conditions that had made these commitments viable dissipated, their political purchase also declined. Emblematic of this emptying of the promise of self-determination was Michael Manley\u2019s return to the position of prime minister.12 Having lost his 1980 reelection as Jamaica still reeled from the consequences of the debt crisis and structural adjustment, Manley assumed the office again in 1989. Converted to the neoliberalism he had resisted in the late 1970s, the erstwhile democratic socialist now insisted, \u201cIf you want a really dynamic, effective economy, the only damn thing you can do is to pursue the market logic completely. . . . That means you have to divest what was brought under state control . . . and [expose] the economy to the shock of competition, knowing full well that some of what has been built up will be lost in order to create a leaner but more enduring process of development.\u201d13", "While Manley himself maintained that he was rethinking and not abandoning democratic socialism, the about-face was undeniable and exemplified the political closure that characterized the fall of self-determination. In a revealing correspondence with Kari Polanyi Levitt, a member of the New World Group at the University of West Indies, Manley reflected on the tragedy this closure entailed.14 At the height of his despair, he concluded that the NIEO was \u201cpredicated on a fantasy\u2014namely that anyone in international politics will respond to an argument built on ethics.\u201d15 When Levitt reminded him, \u201cThe NIEO agenda was not based on \u2018ethics\u2019 but on the sovereign rights of developing countries over natural resources, on the need for codes of conduct for transnationals, and international measures to stabilize commodity prices,\u201d Manley changed his tune.16 In response, he argued that the \u201cfailure to unite OPEC and other developing countries,\u201d which he called the \u201creal tragedy,\u201d and the rise of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, who \u201cburied\u201d the Third World\u2019s demands for equality, had led to the collapse of the NIEO.17 But if this second assessment captured the contingent political conditions that contributed to the NIEO\u2019s displacement, it did not give Manley any hope that anticolonial worldmaking might be resuscitated.", "Like the Manley of the 1990s, we live in the shadow of self-determination\u2019s fall. The vision of a postimperial world order that gave rise to three decades of anticolonial worldmaking appears far removed from our political present. Looking back from our vantage point and with a clear view of the forces arrayed against this project, the fall of self-determination might appear inevitable. We might even believe, as Manley briefly did, that those projects were fantastical and unrealistic. But to come to this set of conclusions is to evade reckoning with the ways that we inhabit as our present the promises and ruins of anticolonial worldmaking. The incomplete decolonization that culminated in a world of unequal nation-states, the regional organizations that emerged from the dream of federation, and the visions of global justice that stand in the place of the NIEO\u2019s welfare world indicate the scale of both expectations and disappointments that characterized anticolonial worldmaking. Examining this present, it would be a mistake to collapse the partiality and eventual decline of a set of languages and strategies for making a world after empire with the demise of the moral and political vision that looked forward to an egalitarian and domination-free world.", "Emerging from the imperial integration and differentiation that has structured the modern world, this vision of an anti-imperial world had different articulations before the rise of self-determination and might yet be remade in new languages and modes. Part of the task of this book has been to show that even instances that appeared as moments of closure\u2014first the decline of interwar internationalisms and the consolidation of a system of nation-states, and later the political and economic limits of the postcolonial state\u2014were occasion for reformulating the contours of an anti-imperial future and enacting new strategies to realize this vision. On this view, the fall of self-determination marks not only a dead end but also a staging ground for reimaging that future. In the Black Atlantic world, from which the worldmakers of this book emerged, intimations of a new language are afoot in the Movement for Black Lives, the Caribbean demand for reparations for slavery and genocide, and South African calls for a social and economic decolonization.

The same confident narratives that assert the world could never be otherwise are fond of ascribing the \u201cfailures\u201d of Southern initiatives to the fundamental unsustainability of an equitable world. These dreams all failed, the argument goes, because they could never have succeeded. Getachew\u2019s argument comes closer to this ending than it should in both historical and political terms. Her account of the \u201cfall\u201d of self-determination is brief.16 Historically, it is rooted in the end of a \u201cmoment.\u201d Key to the fall seems to be the idea that it was the internal limitations of anticolonial nationalism that brought its downfall.17 But it is here that I would urge readers to supplement the reading of Getachew\u2019s excellent book with works more directly focused on (the political economy of) the 1970s, works that attend more precisely to what happened to the initiatives that she is describing, as well as to many others like it. Many have shown that any number of third-world initiatives being asserted during the twentieth-century phase of decolonization\u2014including projects of anticolonial nationalism\u2014were less a series of spontaneous \u201cfalls\u201d generated by internal contradictions than the result of a series of hard and sharp pushes, many from the United States.18 Understanding that the suite of institutional legal, political, and economic struggles of the Third World in the 1970s failed because they were battles lost in a war against powerful interests gives a different valency to many founding myths of the post\u2013Cold War order. These include the idea that there was a radical break with practices of imperialism. This is a mythic caesura crucial to the claim of the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world to be a benevolent bringer of the gift of reason. The book itself exemplifies the way that history-telling is always a political battleground, never more so in the narration of failure and success, victory and defeat. But understanding that the project failed because it was murdered, rather than having died a natural death, is important in the way we return to such histories.19 The particular suite of strategies needed in the ongoing struggle for justice includes recognizing the tendency of the powerful to ontologize the failure of projects of resistance.20", "But this caveat about the interpretation of the failure of the worldmaking project does not negate the achievement of this masterful volume. Its insistence on revealing the centrality of racism to patterns of global ordering is a key element of its importance. And although many of the materials will not be new to most scholars of the postcolonial, the particular emphasis on international relations, institutions, and law is a useful way to introduce the thought of black anticolonial intellectuals to new audiences in disciplines where those figures have been absent for too long.

It\u2019s Eurocentrism that is ideological. But even if we are interested in the global South, many of us educated in the West make, and transmit, this assumption in conditions of received ignorance about the non-West. And certainly, in the discipline of international law, many students in the South are taught to walk in these same patterns. We all know by now that international law has both imperial and counter-imperial dimensions.

The authorization of experience is thus a crucial form of empowerment for students \u2013 a way for them to enter the classroom as speaking subjects. However, this focus on the centrality of experience can also lead to exclusions; it often silences those whose \u201cexperience\u201d is seen to be that of the ruling-class groups. This more-authentic-than-thou attitude to experience also applies to the teacher. For instance, in speaking about Third World peoples, I have to watch constantly the tendency to speak \"for\" Third World peoples. For 1 often come to embody the \"authentic\" authority and experience for many of my students; indeed, they construct me as a native informant in the same way that left-liberal white students sometimes construct all people of color as the authentic voices of their people. This is evident in the classroom when the specific \"differences\" (of personality, posture, behavior, etc.) of one woman of color stand in for the difference of the whole collective, and a collective voice is assumed in place of an individual voice. In effect, this results in the reduction or averaging of Third World peoples in terms of individual personality characteristics: complex ethical and political issues are glossed over, and an ambiguous and more easily manageable ethos of the \u201cpersonal\u201d and the \u201cinterpersonal\u201d takes their place. Thus a particularly problematic effect of certain pedagogical codifications of difference is the conceptualization of race and gender in terms of personal or individual experience. Students often end up determining that they have to \u201cbe more sensitive\u201d to Third World peoples. The formulation of knowledge and politics through these individualistic, attitudinal parameters indicates an erasure of the very politics of knowledge involved in teaching and learning about difference. It also suggests an erasure of the structural and institutional parameters of what it means to understand difference in historical terms. If all conflict in the classroom is seen and understood in personal terms, it leads to a comfortable set of oppositions; people of color as the central voices and the bearers of all knowledge in class, and white people as \u2018observers\u2019 with no responsibility to contribute and/or nothing valuable to contribute. In other words, white students are constructed as marginal observers and students of color as the real \u201cknowers\u201d in such a liberal or left classroom. While it may seem like people of color are thus granted voice and agency in the classroom, it is necessary to consider what particular kind of voice it is that is allowed them/us. It is a voice located in a different and separate space from the agency of white students. Thus, while it appears that in such a class the histories and cultures of marginalized peoples are now \u201clegitimate\u201d objects of study and discussion, the fact is that this legitimation takes place purely at an attitudinal, interpersonal level rather than in terms of a fundamental challenge to hegemonic knowledge and history. Often the culture in such a class vacillates between a high level of tension and an overwhelming desire to create harmony, acceptance of \u201cdifference,\u201d and cordial relations in the classroom. Potentially this implicitly binary construction (Third World students vs. white students) undermines the understanding of complication that students must take seriously in order to understand \"difference\" as historical and relational. Coimplication refers to the idea that all of us (First and Third World) share certain histories as well as certain responsibilities: ideologies of race define both white and black peoples, just as gender ideologies define both women and men. Thus, while \"experience\" is an enabling focus in the classroom, unless it is explicitly understood as historical, contingent, and the result of interpretation, it can coagulate into frozen, binary, psychologistic positions.53 To summarize, this effective separation of white students from Third World students in such an explicitly politicized women's studies classroom is problematic because it leads to an attitudinal engagement that bypasses the complexly situated politics of knowledge and potentially shores up a particular individual-oriented codification and commodification of race. It implicitly draws on and sustains a discourse of cultural pluralism, or what Henry Giroux (1988) calls \"the pedagogy of normative pluralism\" (95), a pedagogy in which we all occupy separate, different, and equally valuable places and where experience is defined not in terms of individual qua individual, but in terms of an individual as representative of a cultural group. This results in a depoliticization and dehistoricization of the idea of culture and makes possible the implicit management of race in the name of cooperation and harmony.

In fact, in my opinion the entire way Americans understand and frame geopolitics was forged during this decade, perhaps the most influential in modern US history.", "The primary impetus behind the transformation in the American imperial imagination was the rise of Nazi Germany. Before Adolf Hitler\u2019s ascendance to the German chancellorship in 1933, Americans generally believed they could negotiate with foreign powers\u2014especially white, European powers\u2014in good faith. But the rise of Hitler in Germany (and Stalin in the Soviet Union, though he was less important) persuaded Americans that there were some people with whom one just couldn\u2019t reason\u2014or, as a well-known book from the early 1940s put it, You Can\u2019t Do Business with Hitler.", "Hitler thus decisively ended two American dreams: first, that reason could replace violence in international relations (or at least, international relations outside the Western Hemisphere); and second, that the United States could afford to remain aloof from European affairs. In fact, many of the first generation of \u201cdefense intellectuals\u201d who would staff and build the US national security establishment during and after World War II were social democrats who in the 1930s embraced a pessimistic theory of geopolitics because they believed Hitler posed a uniquely existential threat to \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d", "Put another way, it was in the 1930s that many American elites endorsed what scholars refer to as a \u201cSchmittian\u201d understanding of geopolitics. Now, it\u2019s crucial to understand who Carl Schmitt was because he was one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. In brief, Schmitt was a German legal theorist (he eventually became a Nazi) who in his famous The Concept of the Political (1932) argued that \u201cthe specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and enemy.\u201d In simpler terms, Schmitt claimed that politics needed to be understood as a struggle between those who were on your side (friends) and those who were not (enemies). To Americans in the 1930s, Hitler and Nazi Germany as a whole were Schmittian enemies with whom one could not negotiate.", "Needless to say, Americans were right to view Hitler and the Nazis as existential enemies. They were vicious brutes who did really want to conquer and dominate a significant portion of the world. The problem, however, was that too many Americans concluded that all geopolitics after Hitler were Schmittian geopolitics. That is to say, Americans began to argue that it was an ontological fact that international relations was a Manichean sphere in which there were good guys (Americans) and bad guys (anyone who disagreed with or challenged Americans). Indeed, the very terms \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys\u201d only took off after World War II. In the late-1940s and beyond, a simple moralism permeated American politics and culture.", "After the United States emerged victorious in World War II, it was quite easy for Americans to transfer their anxieties about Hitler and Nazi Germany onto Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. Stalin, after all, was a brutal and inscrutable dictator with a cult of personality and an enormous military. Moreover, defining the Soviet Union as an existential enemy analogous to Nazi Germany provided Americans with a simple framework through which they could negotiate (and justify) their emergence onto the world stage. The only way to stop the Soviet Union from dominating the world, Americans (and their allies) argued, was for the United States itself to become the global hegemon.", "It was to this project that the United States dedicated itself after World War II. The nation increased its military budget, embraced a posture of permanent mobilization, and constructed a worldwide system of bases that today numbers about 750.", "All of these actions were justified through a Schmittian \u201cCold War logic\u201d that insisted that the peace and prosperity of the United States\u2014indeed, the peace and prosperity of the entire world\u2014depended on confronting the evil Soviet Union wherever it attempted to spread its tentacles. This logic, of course, also vindicated numerous interventions abroad, from the Korean War to the depositions of Iran\u2019s Mohammad Mosaddegh and Guatemala\u2019s Jacobo \u00c1rbenz to the Vietnam War. Indeed, recent research by the political scientist Lindsey O\u2019Rourke has revealed that during the Cold War, the US government tried to covertly overthrow foreign regimes sixty-four times, and in forty-four of these attempts it supported authoritarian forces.", "It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that in the second half of the twentieth century, the United States organized its society and foreign affairs around its supposedly existential struggle with the Soviet Union. This is why, after the Eastern Bloc\u2019s collapse in 1989-1991, a \u201cCold War nostalgia\u201d gripped, and continues to grip, the American elite. At least with the Soviet Union, Americans knew where they stood.", "When the Soviet Union disintegrated, the American Empire was left without a raison d'\u00eatre. In the interregnum of the 1990s, the nation\u2019s elites endeavored to answer a fundamental question: what does an empire without an enemy look like? (As this suggests, few concluded that the United States should, say, abandon its foreign military bases and reduce its military budget.) The answer most people settled on was that the United States should become the \u201cworld\u2019s policeman,\u201d the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d that used its overwhelming power to \u201cprotect\u201d foreign populations whenever they were threatened (or at least, whenever they were threatened by a country not allied to the United States). Thus the nation intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo. But the dramas of the 1990s couldn\u2019t compare to the dramas of the Cold War, when a clear and present danger hovered over American civilization.", "9/11 was a godsend for an increasingly adrift American Empire. The emergence of a \u201cradical Islamic threat\u201d allowed American foreign policymakers to return to the Schmittian logic that had triumphed during the Cold War: similar to the evil Soviets, elites argued, evil \u201cjihadists\u201d promoted a totalizing ideology and wanted to dominate the entire globe. The United States we live in today, with its domestic surveillance, its permanent mobilization, and its endless wars, is the natural outcome of a way of thinking that divides geopolitics into good versus evil.", "Though anxieties about Islam permeated US culture in the 2000s, by the 2010s it became clear that this most recent threat du jour didn\u2019t have the staying power of the Soviet Union\u2014the \u201cjihadists\u201d just weren\u2019t powerful enough to truly threaten the United States. It\u2019s partially for this reason that we\u2019re now witnessing attempts to stoke a \u201cNew Cold War\u201d with China, which, if initiated, would provide the foreign policy establishment with the logic it needs to justify the ever-increasing expenditures that undergird the American Empire.", "Since it began in the mid-twentieth century, champions of the US empire have defended its existence by referencing a series of enemies whose supposed power made it necessary for Americans to dominate the world. As such, one of the most important projects to which leftists can dedicate themselves in 2020 and beyond is threat deflation\u2014persuading their fellow citizens that we\u2019re actually extremely safe and have nothing to fear from terrorists, or Russia, or China, or whomever the next enemy is.

The number of self-identified Democrats who consider it a \u201cmajor threat\u201d is up from 6 in 10 in 2013 to almost 9 in 10 today. A slew of proposals\u2014from the Green New Deal embraced by many progressive environmental groups to a new 538-page climate plan released by Democratic members of a special committee on the climate crisis in the U.S. House of Representatives\u2014lay out various policies. Yet while these plans offer much to celebrate, all of them fall short by focusing on domestic actions while paying scant attention to the global nature of the crisis. Every ton of carbon dioxide contributes to climate change no matter where it is emitted, so an ambitious climate strategy cannot only be domestic\u2014it must put the issue squarely at the center of U.S. foreign policy. Past U.S. efforts to advance global action, such as Washington\u2019s leadership to help secure the 2015 Paris climate agreement, have been key to progress. Yet given both the urgency and global nature of climate change, the issue cannot be siloed into U.S. State Department or Energy Department offices and spheres of diplomacy. Many aspects of U.S. foreign policy will impact, and be impacted by, climate change. An effective foreign policy requires taking climate change directly into consideration\u2014not just as a problem to resolve, but as an issue that can affect the success and failure of strategies in areas as varied as counterterrorism, migration, international economics, and maritime security. Human rights offers some important lessons. In the wake of the Vietnam War and the United States\u2019 secret bombings of Cambodia, public concern for human rights was on the rise. Upon taking office in 1977, President Jimmy Carter declared human rights to be a \u201ccentral concern\u201d of U.S. foreign policy. In contrast to the realpolitik promoted by outgoing Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Carter argued that protecting human rights would advance U.S. interests and was too important to be divorced from other aspects of U.S. foreign policy. Rather, human rights must be \u201cwoven into the fabric of our foreign policy,\u201d as then Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher testified before a Senate subcommittee. Despite Carter\u2019s mixed foreign-policy success, climate change demands a similar centrality. As the defining challenge of our time, climate change must be elevated to a foreign-policy priority and cannot be addressed with a compartmentalized approach. It is necessary, of course, to rejoin the Paris agreement, contribute to international finance efforts such as the Green Climate Fund, curb multilateral coal financing, and collaborate with other countries on clean-energy innovation. Yet all these efforts add up to an international climate strategy, not a climate-centered foreign policy. Truly making climate change a pillar of a foreign-policy strategy would have five key elements. First, the biggest shift from the current U.S. approach would be to take climate change considerations into the mainstream of all national-security and foreign-policy decision-making. If a meeting in the White House Situation Room is not squarely focused on a climate-related concern, it is unlikely any official in the room will bring that perspective to how the issue is discussed. Prioritizing climate change requires integrating its consideration into foreign-policy strategies broadly, just as issues ranging from counterterrorism to nonproliferation are treated today. For example, stability and security are central aims of U.S. foreign policy: They influence how the United States addresses conflict in the Middle East, counters Boko Haram, confronts China, and much more. Yet a strategy for stability in Iraq will not be effective unless it considers the impacts of water scarcity and heat waves on the Iraqi people or the loss of Iraq\u2019s oil revenue as climate policy gradually erodes oil demand. Similarly, the United States\u2019 efforts to counter terrorism in North Africa may prove fruitless unless officials also consider climate impacts on desertification that make local populations vulnerable to terrorists\u2019 promises. A climate-centered foreign policy would also require that foreign-policy actors consider the consequences of their actions for climate change and determine whether less harmful approaches exist. For example, U.S. foreign policy has aimed for many years to rebuild Iraq\u2019s struggling economy by helping the country to boost its oil output, and to address its chronic and politically destabilizing electricity shortages by increasing gas production as well. A climate-centered foreign policy would not only provide assistance to reduce flaring and use that gas within Iraq, but also explore opportunities to attract investment in renewable energy. Iraq\u2019s neighbor Saudi Arabia just announced a $5 billion project to generate solar and wind energy to produce hydrogen. It is easy to say that climate change should be considered when making policy, but much harder to actually do so. As important as climate change is, there are many other urgent foreign-policy priorities, and in many cases there may not be a climate-friendly alternative approach. But foreign-policy makers won\u2019t know whether the alternatives exist or not unless they ask the question. Domestic policymaking shows how it can be done: The National Environmental Policy Act requires that before major federal actions are taken, the relevant agency analyzes the effects on the environment and identifies reasonable alternatives that may mitigate those effects. A similar internal step in the foreign-policy making process\u2014time permitting\u2014would ensure that officials have full information about environmental consequences before they act. Several international financial institutions such as the World Bank have processes, albeit imperfect, to review the environmental impacts of their actions.", ""], "id": "b682872c6cf67ca67df46ac6411f241b3feddcc5ab69dece2407b90941aa04de", "highlighted_text": " plans fall short by focusing on domestic actions efforts to advance global action , have been key the issue cannot be siloed Many aspects of U.S. foreign policy will impact , and be impacted by , climate change climate change  demands centrality and cannot be addressed with a compartmentalized approach a strategy will not be effective unless it considers the impacts of water scarcity and  heat N E P A requires that before federal actions are taken the relevant agency analyzes the effects on the environment and identifies reasonable alternatives A similar internal step  in foreign-policy would ensure officials have information about environmental consequences", "highlights": [[2, 553, 558], [2, 596, 621], [2, 622, 638], [2, 929, 961], [2, 961, 962], [2, 1044, 1057], [2, 1135, 1144], [2, 1145, 1161], [2, 1244, 1284], [2, 1285, 1291], [2, 1291, 1292], [2, 1293, 1299], [2, 1300, 1311], [2, 1311, 1312], [2, 1313, 1327], [2, 2374, 2388], [2, 2388, 2388], [2, 2389, 2396], [2, 2407, 2417], [2, 2519, 2522], [2, 2523, 2576], [2, 3799, 3809], [2, 3832, 3888], [2, 3889, 3903], [2, 3904, 3907], [2, 3907, 3907], [2, 3908, 3912], [2, 5447, 5448], [2, 5456, 5457], [2, 5470, 5471], [2, 5477, 5478], [2, 5481, 5489], [2, 5490, 5501], [2, 5508, 5523], [2, 5524, 5527], [2, 5528, 5533], [2, 5535, 5582], [2, 5583, 5633], [2, 5667, 5676], [2, 5677, 5690], [2, 5690, 5690], [2, 5691, 5693], [2, 5698, 5712], [2, 5744, 5756], [2, 5762, 5776], [2, 5782, 5826]], "underlines": [[2, 541, 546], [2, 553, 558], [2, 559, 595], [2, 596, 621], [2, 622, 638], [2, 639, 674], [2, 675, 688], [2, 689, 709], [2, 710, 713], [2, 714, 897], [2, 898, 918], [2, 918, 918], [2, 919, 928], [2, 929, 961], [2, 1044, 1057], [2, 1058, 1070], [2, 1071, 1089], [2, 1090, 1097], [2, 1098, 1101], [2, 1102, 1115], [2, 1116, 1118], [2, 1119, 1133], [2, 1133, 1134], [2, 1135, 1144], [2, 1145, 1161], [2, 1244, 1284], [2, 1285, 1291], [2, 1293, 1299], [2, 1300, 1311], [2, 1313, 1327], [2, 1329, 1415], [2, 1416, 1541], [2, 1542, 1558], [2, 1560, 1569], [2, 1571, 1594], [2, 1596, 1599], [2, 1600, 1618], [2, 2374, 2388], [2, 2389, 2396], [2, 2407, 2417], [2, 2419, 2494], [2, 2495, 2518], [2, 2519, 2522], [2, 2522, 2522], [2, 2523, 2576], [2, 2576, 2577], [2, 2816, 2819], [2, 2826, 2916], [2, 2918, 3013], [2, 3013, 3013], [2, 3021, 3139], [2, 3140, 3197], [2, 3198, 3469], [2, 3470, 3503], [2, 3799, 3809], [2, 3832, 3888], [2, 3889, 3903], [2, 3904, 3907], [2, 3908, 3912], [2, 4035, 4036], [2, 4042, 4043], [2, 4050, 4057], [2, 4095, 4136], [2, 4137, 4161], [2, 4165, 4180], [2, 4245, 4246], [2, 4247, 4278], [2, 4279, 4284], [2, 4290, 4337], [2, 4338, 4350], [2, 4351, 4438], [2, 5443, 5446], [2, 5447, 5448], [2, 5456, 5457], [2, 5470, 5471], [2, 5477, 5478], [2, 5481, 5489], [2, 5489, 5489], [2, 5490, 5501], [2, 5502, 5507], [2, 5507, 5507], [2, 5508, 5523], [2, 5524, 5527], [2, 5528, 5533], [2, 5533, 5534], [2, 5535, 5582], [2, 5582, 5582], [2, 5583, 5633], [2, 5634, 5665], [2, 5667, 5676], [2, 5677, 5690], [2, 5691, 5693], [2, 5694, 5697], [2, 5697, 5697], [2, 5698, 5712], [2, 5713, 5727], [2, 5744, 5756], [2, 5757, 5761], [2, 5762, 5776], [2, 5777, 5781], [2, 5782, 5826], [2, 5827, 5843], [2, 5852, 5926], [2, 5946, 5999]], "emphasis": [[2, 622, 638], [2, 675, 688], [2, 710, 713], [2, 898, 918], [2, 1090, 1097], [2, 1102, 1115], [2, 1119, 1133], [2, 1145, 1161], [2, 1285, 1291], [2, 1300, 1311], [2, 1313, 1327], [2, 1542, 1558], [2, 1560, 1569], [2, 1571, 1594], [2, 1600, 1618], [2, 2407, 2417], [2, 2495, 2518], [2, 2523, 2576], [2, 2576, 2577], [2, 3140, 3197], [2, 3470, 3503], [2, 3889, 3903], [2, 3908, 3912], [2, 4035, 4036], [2, 4042, 4043], [2, 4137, 4161], [2, 4247, 4278], [2, 4338, 4350], [2, 5447, 5448], [2, 5456, 5457], [2, 5470, 5471], [2, 5477, 5478], [2, 5677, 5690]], "cite_emphasis": [[6, 13], [14, 16]], "filename": "neg-3.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-07-27"}, {"tag": "Warming causes extinction", "cite": "David Spratt 19, Research Director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration, Ian Dunlop, member of the Club of Rome, formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chairman of the Australian Coal Association, May 2019, \u201cExistential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach,\u201d https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf", "body": ["An existential risk to civilisation is one posing permanent large negative consequences to humanity which may never be undone, either annihilating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtailing its potential.

But this figure does not include \u201clong-term\u201d carbon-cycle feedbacks, which are materially relevant now and in the near future due to the unprecedented rate at which human activity is perturbing the climate system. Taking these into account, the Paris path would lead to around 5\u00b0C of warming by 2100. Scientists warn that warming of 4\u00b0C is incompatible with an organised global community, is devastating to the majority of ecosystems, and has a high probability of not being stable. The World Bank says it may be \u201cbeyond adaptation\u201d. But an existential threat may also exist for many peoples and regions at a significantly lower level of warming. In 2017, 3\u00b0C of warming was categorised as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d with a warning that, on a path of unchecked emissions, low-probability, high-impact warming could be catastrophic by 2050. The Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute, Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, warns that \u201cclimate change is now reaching the end-game, where very soon humanity must choose between taking unprecedented action, or accepting that it has been left too late and bear the consequences.\u201d He says that if we continue down the present path \u201cthere is a very big risk that we will just end our civilisation. The human species will survive somehow but we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the last two thousand years.\u201d11 Unfortunately, conventional risk and probability analysis becomes useless in these circumstances because it excludes the full implications of outlier events and possibilities lurking at the fringes.12 Prudent risk-management means a tough, objective look at the real risks to which we are exposed, especially at those \u201cfat-tail\u201d events, which may have consequences that are damaging beyond quantification, and threaten the survival of human civilisation. Global warming projections display a \u201cfat-tailed\u201d distribution with a greater likelihood of warming that is well in excess of the average amount of warming predicted by climate models, and are of a higher probability than would be expected under typical statistical assumptions. More importantly, the risk lies disproportionately in the \u201cfat-tail\u201d outcomes, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Over that century and a half, federal judges adjudicated dozens of war-related disputes raised by private litigants that hinged on executive branch adherence to Congress\u2019s prior legislative direction. Today, presidents of both parties order new offensive military actions abroad without explicit congressional consent before or even during the conflict. Although House and Senate majorities eventually support these actions one way or another (bills and/or appropriations), on 10 occasions, members of Congress (up to 110 at a time) challenged presidential wars in federal court. These unsuccessful lawsuits deserve new attention because they reflect a quiet, but steady, three-branch constitutional revolution on war that has taken place in the United States, under both parties\u2019 watch and under a variety of foreign policy contexts. If all three branches now interpret congressional silence as consent, constitutional war processes have flipped, and the War Powers Resolution is a dead letter. ", "This article offers three arguments about these developments, using case law, institutional archives, and interviews with members of Congress and their attorneys.1 First, there is no constitutional reason for federal courts to demur on war powers suits filed by members of Congress, outside of decades of judge-made precedent. Federal judges and scholars are divided on whether courts should take these cases, not whether they can. Second, federal courts hold member\u2013plaintiffs to a different standard than private interest litigants. Members of Congress must show supermajority disapproval of the president\u2019s unilateral actions whereas private war litigation once hinged on prior simple majority authorization of the action. Third, the legal postures of all three branches reflect deeply ingrained institutional habits, not partisan differences. Unlike other public policy areas, presidential war is not ideologically divisive.", "Reflecting this new normal, the United States has been engaged in a military campaign against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) since August 2014, with no Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). According to the Department of Defense, Operation Inherent Resolve has cost an average of $11 million per day for 450 days of operations, which destroyed or damaged over 16,000 targets.2 While calling for new AUMF in the State of the Union Address in January 2015, and sending a proposal to Congress earlier that year, President Barack Obama and his administration maintained that the necessary authorization is already in place through the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs (against al-Qaeda and Iraq, respectively; Weed 2015b). While ISIS-related terrorist attacks in France have fueled some bipartisan criticism of administration strategy, a new AUMF is unlikely (Carney 2015).", "Despite repeated cries of \u201clawlessness\u201d against the president on domestic policy actions, members of Congress have not pursued a lawsuit on the ISIS actions. Even if members did band together to file a suit that challenged the current ISIS campaign, it is unlikely to jump the formidable hurdles to member suits that federal courts have built over four decades. However, a House-sanctioned lawsuit against the Obama administration on enforcement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was recently granted standing to proceed on the merits regarding whether the administration spent money on ACA implementation that was not appropriated by Congress (see United States House of Representatives v. Burwell 2015). Regardless of the ultimate outcome, members can use this case to push the argument that federal courts are a legitimate alternate arena for interbranch disputes. Divided government, partisan gridlock, and a dysfunctional political culture may prevent Congress from using normal legislative processes to challenge presidential actions, but does that mean any president can operate unilaterally until disapproved?", "Scholars have taken up different facets of this question since 9/11, with fresh assessments of the policy, partisan, and institutional contours of a new \u201cimperial presidency\u201d (Rudalevige 2006). We are also reminded that congressional war powers are enumerated in the Constitution and the framers\u2019 intentions for prior congressional authorization are clear, except in cases of emergency defensive actions (Edelson and Starr-Deeken 2015; Fisher 2013). Yet, the Bush and Obama presidencies defend versions of a \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d of war that largely rejects outside institutional meddling (Posner and Vermeule 2011; Yoo 2010), provoking repeated criticism (Edelson 2013b; Kassop 2003; Pfiffner 2008; Pious 2006). The contemporary House and Senate are also getting renewed attention, with some studies highlighting their formal and informal influence prior to presidential war decisions (Howell and Pevehouse 2007; Kriner 2014) and afterward in the oversight process (Kriner 2010). But these studies do not extinguish long-held accusations of congressional abdication (Fisher 2000b). Congress also shows bursts of short-lived ambition as it pivots from delegation of power to regret and criticism of the use of delegated power (and then delegates again) in domestic and foreign policy (Farrier 2004, 2010).", "Federal courts are not a panacea to this state of affairs, but a combination of aggressive presidents, ambivalent congresses, and disinterested justices have clearly upended the Madisonian constitutional system. Unlike civil rights, civil liberties, and economic federalism, federal courts are inconsistent in their interest and more ideologically mixed in separation of powers cases. However, there was once a vibrant debate within the law and courts literature regarding whether or not the federal courts (and especially the Supreme Court) should apply their vast constitutional authority to foreign policy conflicts. Advocates of judicial restraint argued that federal courts should preserve legitimacy and institutional capital by eschewing certain types of cases (Bickel 1986). Avoiding separation of powers (and many federalism claims) would allow the courts to concentrate on protecting individual liberties and small group rights because they are structured in part to attend to these claims (Choper 1980, 2005). On legislative processes, however, courts are ill equipped to police interbranch balance, especially when Congress chooses not to defend itself (Devins and Fisher 2015). Other scholars argue that federal courts could provide a deterrent to unilateral presidential war and/or put pressure on Congress to act. While it is not ideal to \u201csettle\u201d war powers conflicts in court, there is no reason for presidential actions to be off the table automatically (Glennon 1990; Keynes 1982; Redish 1985). Far from deciding to go to war, Ely argued courts \u201chave every business insisting that the officials the Constitution entrusts with that decision be the ones who make it\u201d (1993, 54).", "Rather than advocating for judicial supremacy, this article argues that federal courts can jumpstart or reframe constitutional dialogues on war, just by accepting a member lawsuit on the merits and focusing on the origins of presidential authority for the action rather than legislative disapproval after it is already in progress. Rather than being the \u201cfinal word,\u201d federal courts inspire broader conversations and direct legislative responses (Burgess 1992; Devins and Fisher 2015; Tushnet 1999). For example, a federal court can declare a nonemergency, offensive war action unconstitutional pending legislative authorization. While a formal withdrawal order would be unlikely from the court, and unwelcome by many, Congress could be granted a \u201creasonable time to consider the issue\u201d (Ely 1993, 54). Presidents would then risk a legal and political rebuke when assuming prior authorization is optional, not required. Congress would be forced to make a decision one way or another, and their deliberations would be on the record. While this idea seems fanciful, Supreme Court scrutiny of presidential war powers was once fairly routine.", "Three Branch Constitutional Flip from the Quasi War to Vietnam", "A systemic shift on constitutional war processes took place across all three branches in the second half of the twentieth century. Before that time, presidents did not advocate unilateral war outside of defensive and emergency situations (Edelson 2013a). Congress was also protective of its war prerogatives, and federal courts scrutinized presidential military orders for evidence of prior authorization, when cases arose from private interest injury claims (Fisher 2005; Silverstein 1997). The sea change in constitutional processes reflects institutional landmarks stretching over two decades. President Truman\u2019s initiation of the Korean War under UN authority in 1950, Congress\u2019s passage of the broad delegation of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, and the Supreme Court\u2019s handling of Vietnam-era member lawsuits.", "Early Judicial Interest in War", "From the plain language of the Constitution\u2019s text, war is a three-branch power. Congress receives the power to declare war in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. In Article II, Section 2, the \u201cPresident shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States\u201d (emphasis added). Article III, Section 2 says \u201cjudicial power shall extend to all cases ... arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority.\u201d These clauses were interpreted early on by government officials present at the ratification. The Supreme Court decided the first of three \u201cQuasi War\u201d case in 1800, predating Marbury v. Madison by three years (and never overturned, see Adler 2000, 159). From these cases through the rest of the nineteenth century, the Court not only ruled for legislative primacy in war, as noted in the first chapter epigraph, but also for the Court\u2019s power to review presidential action.", "In the Quasi cases, all filed by private litigants, the Supreme Court had to decide whether France was an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States and, in effect, whether the country was at war. The ambiguities stemmed from the fact that Congress had passed laws authorizing limited military activity by the executive branch, but did not declare war against France formally. Justice Salmon Chase explained that \u201cperfect\u201d (declared by Congress) and \u201cimperfect\u201d (authorized by Congress) military actions were still wars for the purposes of the private compensation at issue in the case (Bas v. Tingy 1800, 37, 40-41).", "Another Quasi War case decision, written by Chief Justice John Marshall, said even more explicitly that to understand the state of affairs with another nation, one has to look at legislative actions. \u201cThe whole powers of war being by the Constitution of the United States vested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry\u201d (Talbot v. Seeman 1801, 28). In the final Quasi case, Chief Justice Marshall ruled against the president\u2019s orders during, not after, the military action, saying his \u201cinstructions cannot change the nature of the transaction, or legalize an act which without those instructions would have been a plain trespass\u201d (Little v. Barreme 1804, 170, 179).", "Through the rest of the century, including the War of 1812, Mexican\u2013American War, Civil War, and the Spanish American War, additional Supreme Court rulings addressed the authorization for individual actions against foreign governments, habeas corpus petitions, property disputes; and much more. In these cases, federal court decisions repeatedly endorsed a Congress-centered foreign policy by focusing on laws (or lack thereof) to determine the outcome. Landmark twentieth-century war-related cases still hinged on tracing some congressional authorization of the action, even if the president\u2019s actions were sustained (Korematsu v. United States 1944; United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Company 1936). Also through judicial scrutiny of Congress\u2019s wishes, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952) denied President Truman the right to order his commerce secretary to seize domestic steel mills to avert labor strife that he argued would undermine U.S. war efforts during the Korean conflict. The often-cited concurring opinion by Justice Robert Jackson said the president has greatest power when he is given explicit authority to act (Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co., v. Sawyer, 1952, 637, Jackson, J., concurring).", "Beginning around this time, however, three additional events shifted constitutional assumptions away from Justice Jackson\u2019s statement. First, the Korean War was launched in 1950. It was the first truly presidential war because President Truman executed a UN resolution to delegitimize and repel Communist forces in the Korean peninsula without explicit congressional authorization (see Fisher 1995; Keynes 1982). A decade later, the Supreme Court issued the landmark case on the \u201cpolitical question doctrine\u201d (Baker v. Carr 1962), which said the court should avoid certain kinds of cases because they are committed by the Constitution, or better suited to, the other branches. (As noted in the epigraph, foreign policy was not yet cordoned off as a political question.) Then, in 1964, President Lyndon Johnson received broad authorization to escalate U.S. commitments in Vietnam. President Richard Nixon\u2019s expansion of the inherited conflict brought the first member lawsuits and a judicial pivot toward restraint.", "Judicial Division and Rebuff on First Member War Cases", "The Tonkin Gulf Resolution passed unanimously in the House of Representatives, and only two senators voted against it. It said \u201cCongress approves and supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression.\u201d3 Johnson\u2019s escalation of the war through this broad guideline prompted a national popular antiwar movement and congressional backlash, leading to his decision not to seek the Democratic nomination in 1968. Richard Nixon inherited the 1964 authority when he took office in 1969 and within a year expanded U.S. military action into Cambodia and Laos. Congress passed the \u201cFulbright Proviso\u201d in 1970, saying any action in these countries must be limited to assisting the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Congress repealed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in 1971. The two branches tangled over the contours of the Cambodia operations in particular for the next three years, with Nixon\u2019s arguing that his administration could not be micromanaged by Congress.", "Nixon\u2019s actions also inspired 70 federal lawsuits, filed by novel types of litigants including soldiers, their families, citizens, taxpayers, and even a state (Massachusetts). The named defendants in these suits were executive branch department heads or Nixon himself. At all three levels (district, appeals, and Supreme), federal judges seemed to wrestle openly with how and whether to take these unconventional kinds of cases. In the member suits, federal courts were divided, but ultimately opted to burden Congress, not the president. The House and Senate had not exhausted all modes of disapproval of Nixon\u2019s expansion of the war through other constitutional weapons, including overturning presidential vetoes and even impeachment.", "Mitchell v. Laird (1973). This case was the first Congress-member lawsuit in U.S. history. It was filed by Representative Parren Mitchell (D-MD) and 12 other members of the House in 1971 against the president, secretaries of state, defense, and the three branches of the military. The plaintiffs alleged that the United States had been engaged in new expansions of the war for seven years (since the 1964 Resolution) without obtaining \u201ceither a declaration of war or an explicit, intentional and discrete authorization of war,\u201d which had the effect of \u201cunlawfully impair[ing] and defeat[ing] plaintiffs\u2019 Constitutional right, as members of the Congress of the United States, to decide whether the United States should fight a war.\u201d The first demand of the lawsuit was a judicial order to stop the executive branch from prosecuting the current military campaigns unless, within 60 days, Congress \u201cexplicitly, intentionally and discretely authorized a continuation of the war.\u201d The second demand was for \u201ca declaratory judgment that defendants are carrying on a war in violation of Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the United States Constitution.\u201d A district court dismissed the case on standing (Mitchell v. Laird 1973, 613).", "The court of appeals examined several issues, some not raised in the first round, then agreed to dismiss the case. In the opinion, Judge Charles Wyzanski and David Bazelon (appointed by Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, respectively) acknowledged that the three-judge panel came to the dismissal through different jurisprudential paths. The case was ripe, not moot, and standing was approved. The political question doctrine was the fundamental barrier. In 1973, the Vietnam and Laos parts of the conflict were winding down or ended, but the Cambodia involvement was still ongoing. The panel conceded that the Vietnam War was a war in the Article 1 sense and that Congress had not authorized all the president\u2019s actions. Therefore, President Nixon\u2019s only duty was to end the military operations. The nonjusticiable political question was the factual determination of how and whether he was winding it down, or not.", "If not, the judges cited a variety of other paths afforded to plaintiffs, including legislation, veto overrides, and pursuit of impeachment and conviction. The judges acknowledged that prior authorization was lacking (noted in the third epigraph), and that appropriations and even conscription bills were incomplete expressions of congressional policy preferences. \u201cThis court cannot be unmindful of what every schoolboy knows: that in voting to appropriate money or to draft men a congressman is not necessarily approving of the continuation of a war no matter how specifically the appropriation or draft act refers to that war\u201d (Mitchell v. Laird 1973, 616). The logic of this argument is that while congressional majorities had not explicitly authorized the Cambodia campaign, nor had they used all the supermajority powers at their disposal to stop it. According to an attorney involved in the case, while the judges appeared sincerely torn by the war\u2019s questionable authorization and outcome, there was no interest in taking any responsibility for the next steps of policy or directly challenging President Nixon.4", "Holtzman v. Richardson/Schlesinger (1973). The continued impasse on Cambodia directly inspired two related lawsuits filed by House member Elizabeth Holtzman (D-NY) and nine Air Force personnel against both of Nixon\u2019s secretaries of defense in 1973 (Schlesinger replaced Richardson when the latter was appointed attorney general that same year). At the time of the first filing in April, a cease-fire was in effect in Vietnam, and all American prisoners of war had been returned; still, no explicit congressional authorization existed for the ongoing bombing of Cambodia. In response to the lawsuit, according to a statement of facts in the first [Richardson] case, \u201cthe Executive has informed Congress that it is prepared to continue its military activities whether or not the Congress appropriates funds for the Cambodian combat operations\u201d (Holtzman v. Richardson 1973, 547). Congress nevertheless tried to stop the bombings via an appropriations bill rider, President Nixon vetoed the bill, and the House did not have enough votes to override.5 Nixon signed a compromise bill that mandated the bombings stop August 15.", "As this legislative conflict played out, district Judge Orrin Judd (nominated by President Johnson) broke with the Mitchell ruling and confirmed that Holtzman \u201chas raised a serious constitutional question dealing with the war-making power of Congress enumerated in Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution ... The power to wage war is a controversy arising under the Constitution and therefore within the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d Rejecting the political question doctrine and other justiciability objections by the government, Judge Judd said the constitutional question was not hypothetical or abstract in this suit and that Holtzman had standing (Holtzman v. Richardson 1973, 549). In July, after the case\u2019s name had been switched to Schlesinger (new secretary of defense), Judd ruled again for Holtzman, providing both declaratory and injunctive relief. The judgment declared that \u201cthere is no existing Congressional authority to order military forces into combat in Cambodia or to release bombs over Cambodia, and that military activities in Cambodia by American armed forces are unauthorized and unlawful\u201d and restrained defendants and their staff from \u201cparticipating in any way in military activities in or over Cambodia or releasing any bombs which may fall [there]\u201d (Holtzman v. Schlesinger 1973, 553).", "The order was stayed until the end of July as the legislative conflicts continued. However, Judge Judd acknowledged that the barrier to congressional control of the war was its", "lack of two-thirds to override Nixon\u2019s veto. Simple majorities were already on the record. It cannot be the rule that the President needs a vote of only one-third plus one of either House in order to conduct a war, but this would be the consequence of holding that Congress must override a Presidential veto in order to terminate hostilities which it has not authorized ... In order to avoid a constitutional crisis that would have resulted in a temporary shutdown of vital federal activities...Congress agreed to hold off any action affirmatively cutting off funds for military purposes until August 15, 1973. (Holtzman v. Schlesinger 1973, 565)", "Between the district and appeals court rulings, the Supreme Court became involved through applications to vacate the stay issued by Judge Judd. In the first round, Justice Thurgood Marshall (in his circuit justice capacity) denied the plaintiff\u2019s application to vacate. Although he strongly hinted at his policy agreement with Congresswoman Holtzman, Marshall said he needed to reflect the votes of the rest of the court when acting in his circuit capacity. He said, \u201cif the decision were mine alone, I might well conclude on the merits that continued American military operations in Cambodia are unconstitutional.... When the final history of the Cambodian war is written, it is unlikely to make pleasant reading. The decision to send American troops [to Southeast Asia] ... may ultimately be adjudged to have been not only unwise, but also unlawful\u201d (Holtzman v. Schlesinger 1973, 1312-13). Justice Douglas filed a dissent on the procedural issue regarding vacating the stay and disagreed with Marshall\u2019s premise that the court had no place in weighing in on what Douglas viewed as an equivalent of a capital punishment case. \u201cIt has become popular to think the President has that power to declare war. But there is not a word in the Constitution that grants that power to him. It runs only to Congress ... But even if the \u2018war\u2019 in Vietnam were assumed to be a constitutional one, the Cambodian bombing is quite a different affair\u201d (Holtzman v. Schlesinger 1973, 1319-20).", "The appellate court heard the case on August 8. Judge Judd\u2019s district court opinion was overturned 2-1 by the DC Circuit (all three were Nixon appointees). The majority cited the August 15 cutoff date as an indication that all actions up to that point were authorized and invoked the political question doctrine. The dissent said military capacity and authority are separate (Holtzman v. Schlesinger 1973, 1308-10). The case had two long-term legacies. First, the political question doctrine was applied to war in two back-to-back cases, building a powerful set of precedents against future lawsuits. Second, the case litigants connected undeliberated war expansion with failed policy that destabilized Cambodia for decades.6", "Member Litigation after the War Powers Resolution", "At the same time as the Mitchell and Holtzman cases went through the federal system, Congress debated and passed the War Powers Resolution (WPR) of 1973. Its intention was to force interbranch collaboration before and during new military operations abroad. Yet almost every president since its passage has explicitly denied, or implicitly tested, the WPR\u2019s constitutionality, beginning with President Nixon\u2019s veto.7 Presidents have since reported 160 actions as \u201cconsistent\u201d with the WPR requirements (Weed 2015a). Eight lawsuits filed by members of Congress accused presidents of not complying with the WPR and other legal and constitutional requirements for offensive actions, including Ronald Reagan (interventions in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Grenada, and IranIraq war), George H. W. Bush (first Persian Gulf War), Bill Clinton (Kosovo), George W. Bush (Iraq), and Barack Obama (Libya) (Garcia 2012).", "While its purpose is clear in its preamble, rebalancing congressional\u2013presidential power over war decisions, the WPR included loopholes and internal contradictions that did little to help restrain presidents or embolden Congresses.8 Section 2(c) appears to provide clear, limited parameters for new military action, saying the president, as commander in chief, can introduce U.S. armed forces into situations of hostilities or imminent hostilities \u201conly pursuant to\u2014(1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\u201d9", "But these presidential restrictions are undermined by sections 3 and 4. In section 3, presidents are required to consult with Congress \u201cin every possible instance\u201d before introducing U.S. forces (of any military branch) into \u201chostilities or ... situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.\u201d In section 4 (a)(1), regardless of the extent of consultation, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of the start of a military action if a declaration of war or other legislative authorization had not been passed by both chambers. In section 5(b), if Congress did not vote to approve the action, before or after forces were committed, they would be withdrawn by the president within 60 days, which could be extended to 90 days for special military circumstances. However, section 5(c) says Congress can also vote to remove forces by concurrent resolution at any time, which would not be subject to a presidential veto. Sections 6 and 7 lay out the expedited legislative procedures to prioritize congressional authorization related to the reported conflict, or a withdrawal resolution. Section 8 says that authorization for military force cannot be construed from appropriations bills or treaties, unless accompanied by a separate authorization. Hinting at future litigation, a \u201cseparability\u201d clause in section 9 says if any part \u201cis held invalid\u201d then the rest still stands.10", "Influencing later WPR cases, two separate member lawsuits challenged President Jimmy Carter\u2019s unilateral changes to the Panama Canal and Taiwan treaties. In the Taiwan case, Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) and others said the Senate must consent to the action of undoing a treaty, just as the Constitution requires two-thirds of the body to ratify it. Writing for a divided court, the majority contrasted the case with Youngstown, saying in that case \u201cprivate litigants brought a suit contesting the President\u2019s authority under his war powers to seize the Nation\u2019s steel industry, an action of profound and demonstrable domestic impact. Here, by contrast, we are asked to settle a dispute between coequal branches of our Government, each of which has resources available to protect and assert its interests, resources not available to private litigants outside the judicial forum\u201d (Goldwater v. Carter 1979, 1004, Rehnquist, J. concurring). Both treaty cases placed the burdens on the House and Senate to demonstrate a genuine interbranch impasse, which can only occur if Congress passes formal legislation (Fisher 2014, 284-88).", "Member Litigation against Presidents Reagan and Bush I", "All post-WPR litigation built on the Mitchell and Holtzman precedents. First, the cases are dismissed on a variety of justiciability grounds; judges did not rule directly on the legitimacy and application of the WPR. Second, unlike private litigation prior to Vietnam, most judges do not trace presidential action to prior congressional authorization, nor compel reporting under the WPR, but rather reverse the burden to inquire whether there is supermajority disapproval of action in progress. Third, while there is ample evidence of partisanship in the lineup of member\u2013plaintiffs against opposition party presidents, there is no ideological distinction in the constitutional claims made by Democrats and Republicans in either branch. Congress members of both parties assert the same constitutional points, as do presidents of both parties. Judges appointed presidents of both parties are largely dismissive of the cases. Crockett v. Reagan (1982-83). During a brewing civil war that was destabilizing El Salvador, President Jimmy Carter tried to shore up support for its military government through various forms of assistance beginning in 1979. Although called \u201cnon-lethal\u201d aid, the United States sent equipment such as \u201ctear gas grenades, grenade launchers, night vision instruments, image intensifiers, and other riot control and counterinsurgency equipment\u201d (Harris and Espinosa 1981, 297). An attack on American nuns by a death squad linked to the rightist faction of the junta in December 1980 led Carter to suspend some of the aid pending an investigation. Then, in February and March 1981, newly elected President Ronald Reagan sent 35 military advisors to assist the Salvadoran government, in addition to maintaining the 19 dispatched by President Carter. President Reagan\u2019s interest in expanding U.S. influence in El Salvador reflected a hemispheric cold war strategy. The new decretary of dtate, Alexander Haig, argued that U.S. interests required supporting the right-wing junta to head off a new Latin America \u201cdomino\u201d effect of Communist influence emanating from Cuba (LeoGrande 1981).", "While the legislative\u2013executive wrangling went on for three more years over El Salvador, Crockett v. Reagan was filed early on by opponents in Congress. The lawsuit was the first one to allege violations of the WPR when it was filed in 1981 by 29 House members (all Democrats) who protested the lack of a formal WPR report, among other claims. In a one-of-a-kind response by the president\u2019s supporters in Congress, the lawsuit prompted the same number of Republicans (13 senators and 16 Congress memebers including one southern conservative Democrat) to file an amicus curiae brief against their colleagues, claiming the original group was going to court too hastily. The allegations by Representative George W. Crockett (D-MI) et al. against the administration included violations of the Constitution, the WPR, and a legislative ban on foreign aid and military assistance to any regime alleged to have engaged in extensive human rights abuses. The defendants (President Reagan, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig) argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and assistance had been authorized by an act of Congress in 1981. While not conceding the constitutionality of the WPR, the administration said there were no \u201chostilities.\u201d", "Federal District Judge Joyce Hens Green (nominated by President Carter) dismissed the case, saying federal courts were not institutionally equipped or situated to define the nature of the El Salvador operation. In an interview, a House coplaintiff who had also voted in favor of the WPR in 1973 vehemently disagreed with Judge Green\u2019s claim that fact finding on war was not possible for a judge. The member had visited El Salvador during the early 1980s and said \u201cit looked like a war to us.\u201d The member added that judges routinely engage in other types of fact finding.11 Judge Green instead dismissed the lawsuit on political question grounds. First, citing Baker v. Carr, Mitchell v. Laird, and Holtzman v. Schlesinger, she said the courts could not assess the facts of the case on which the two sides disagreed: were there \u201chostilities\u201d in El Salvador or not? Second, Judge Green cited Goldwater v. Carter in her argument that a \u201cconstitutional impasse appropriate for judicial resolution would be presented\u201d only if the president ignored a resolution requiring a report per WPR section 5(b) or withdrawal of the advisers. \u201c[T]he nature of the fact finding in these circumstances precludes judicial inquiry,\u201d but she allowed that the WPR was still open for future justiciability (Crockett v. Reagan 1982, 897-98). An appeals court affirmed, saying members lack standing without a clear \u201cnullification or diminution of a congressman\u2019s vote\u201d shown by bill passage (Crockett v. Reagan 1983, 1357, Bork, J. concurring). Defendants prevailed with another pro-presidential precedent.", "Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan (1983-85). In 1979, the Sandinistas, a left-wing guerrilla group, overthrew the Somoza family dictatorship that had ruled Nicaragua since the 1930s. In President Reagan\u2019s first term, he issued national security findings and directives to create the \u201cContras,\u201d a counterrevolutionary force. After Congress appropriated money to support the Contras in 1981, the first \u201cBoland Amendment\u201d passed in 1982 (named for Representative Edward P. Boland, D-MA), banning the executive branch from spending any money \u201cfor the purpose of overthrowing the government of Nicaragua.\u201d12 Leaked classified memos proved the Reagan administration was not adhering to Boland. In 1983, the House voted to cut off all Contra aid, but a Senate-based compromise allowed $24 million, a fraction of the administration\u2019s request. Ultimately, two more restrictive amendments passed the House and Senate in the first term. Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan was filed in 1983 and focused on adherence to the first Boland. Twelve members of the House of Representatives (all Democrats) joined over a dozen private citizens of Nicaragua (who alleged damages due to actions of the U.S.- supported Contra rebels) and Florida (who alleged damages due to paramilitary training operations). The suit was filed to protest U.S. paramilitary operations that the plaintiffs alleged violated various neutrality laws, the National Security Act of 1947, the Boland Amendment, WPR, and the Constitution (Michaels 1987). The plaintiffs said that the judiciary is needed to control executive abuses of power in this case \u201cbecause Congress has done all it can, namely, pass legislation.\u201d District court judge Howard Corcoran (nominated by President Lyndon Johnson) dismissed the case as a political question. He said \u201ca court must take special care, when confronted with a challenge to the validity of U.S. foreign policy initiatives, to give appropriate deference to the decisions of the political branches, who are constitutionally empowered to conduct foreign relations\u201d (Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan 1983, 599-600). Judge Corcoran cited Baker v. Carr, the Vietnam-era cases, as well as the recent Crockett precedent. He also echoed Judge Green, saying the case required fact finding that is beyond the court\u2019s competence.", "Were this Court to decide ... that President Reagan either is mistaken, or is shielding the truth, one or both of the coordinate branches would be justifiably offended ... and there is a real danger of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question ... Such an occurrence would, undoubtedly, rattle the delicate diplomatic balance that is required in the foreign affairs arena ... It is, therefore, prudent for us to decline to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this time. (Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan 1983, 599) The appeals court affirmed Judge Corcoran\u2019s decision unanimously. Future Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (a Reagan appointee) delivered the opinion, citing mootness because the appropriations rider at issue in this lawsuit (Boland I) expired in 1983. ", "The congressional appellants also allege that assistance to the Contras is tantamount to waging war, so that they \u2018have been deprived of their right to participate in the decision to declare war\u2019 in violation of the war powers clause of the Constitution, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 11 ... Dismissal of this claim is required by our decision in Crockett v. Reagan, which upheld dismissal of a similar claim by twenty-nine members of Congress relating to alleged military activity in El Salvador on the ground that the war powers issue presented a nonjusticiable political question. (Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan 1985, 210) Another future justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (a Carter appointee), filed a concurrence on ripeness grounds, blaming Congress for ambiguities on U.S. support for the Contras. Ginsburg also cited Goldwater v. Carter, saying Congress had not thrown down the \u201cgauntlet\u201d by using its own tools, which are more powerful than the federal court (Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan 1985, 211).", "Conyers v. Reagan (1984). October 1983 was an active month for U.S. military engagement. On October 12, 1983, President Reagan signed a congressional resolution that spelled out an 18-month continuation of U.S. troop presence in Lebanon, ending an interbranch dispute about Congress\u2019s role in the deployment. Upon signing, Reagan said it \u201cwas not to be used as any acknowledgement that the President\u2019s constitutional authority can be impermissibly infringed by statute\u201d (Rubner 1985, 629). The next day, Maurice Bishop, the left-leaning prime minister of Grenada who had seized power in 1979, was arrested by members of his own militia. Bishop was temporarily freed by supporters on October 18 but was assassinated later that day. Bishop was replaced by what Reagan described as a more staunchly pro-Cuban junta. President Reagan decided to invade Grenada on October 24 and then announced it the next day, citing the presence of around 1,000 U.S. medical students on the island.", "Reagan sent a written report of the invasion to the speaker of the House, Thomas P. O\u2019Neill (D-MA), and the president pro tempore of the Senate, Strom Thurmond (R-SC), on October 25. The president said the letter was \u201cconsistent with\u201d the WPR. He did not mention that troops were going into \u201chostilities,\u201d which would trigger the WPR clock. The House and Senate moved swiftly to approve resolutions to hold the Grenada operations to a 60-day timetable.13 Around the same time, Representative John Conyers (DMI) was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit filed against the president that challenged his authority to invade Grenada in the first place without congressional authorization. Ten other House Democrats signed onto the suit, most of whom had joined in previous suits, including Parren Mitchell (D-MD).", "District judge Joyce Hens Green dismissed the suit, citing the member war suit precedents (two before and two after the WPR), including her own Crockett decision. She also utilized the novel equitable discretion doctrine theory that said courts should be leery of accepting cases from plaintiffs (especially members of Congress) who have other methods of resolving their disputes (see McGowan 1981). ", "If plaintiffs are successful in persuading their colleagues about the wrongfulness of the President\u2019s actions, they will be provided the remedy they presently seek from this Court. If plaintiffs are unsuccessful in their efforts, it would be unwise for this Court to scrutinize that determination and interfere with the operations of the Congress ... the Court must withhold jurisdiction of this matter and exercise judicial restraint. (Conyers v. Reagan 1984, 327)", "By the time the case reached the Appeals Court in 1985, the final noncombat troops were slated to leave Granada. The appeal was dismissed for mootness unanimously by the three judges, Tamm, Wald, and Bork (nominated by Presidents Johnson, Carter, and Reagan, respectively). The issue of whether the WPR clock was triggered by \u201chostilities\u201d was not resolved. In the mission, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and 116 were wounded, 24 Cuban soldiers were killed and 59 wounded, and Grenadian casualties included 45 killed and 337 wounded (Rubner 1985, 628). The final suit against President Reagan pivoted away from Central American to the Persian Gulf.", "Lowry v. Reagan (1987). Beginning in 1986, during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Iranian military vessels around the Persian Gulf threatened Kuwaiti oil tankers. Kuwait reached out to both the Soviet Union and the United States for protection. Upon hearing that Kuwaitis requested that the United States reflag six vessels and the Soviet Union five, the Reagan administration offered to reflag all eleven tankers (Ciarrocchi 1987, 7). In 1987, 37 U.S. sailors were killed by a missile attack on the USS Stark in the Persian Gulf by Iraq. In response, the administration augmented a single aircraft carrier with 11 warships, six minesweepers, and over a dozen small patrol boats. Secretary of State George P. Shultz submitted a letter on the buildup to Speaker of the House Jim Wright (D-TX) but did not mention the WPR or clock. The administration did not file formal reports after two U.S. ships struck mines in summer 1987, nor when a U.S. fighter plane shot missiles at an Iranian aircraft the U.S. crew perceived as threatening.14 During this time, military personnel were also receiving \u201cdanger pay,\u201d reflecting potential \u201chostilities\u201d (Grimmett 2012, 16-17).", "Alleging the presence of \u201chostilities\u201d and \u201cimminent hostilities,\u201d 110 Democratic House plaintiffs filed a federal suit to demand a formal WPR report. In the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, Lowry v. Reagan, the judge said a \u201cprofusion of relevant congressional activity\u201d in response to the president\u2019s actions in the Persian Gulf was evidence that this was a matter for the two branches to work out among themselves. The litigants had in fact worried that legislative activity would shift the judicial spotlight from Reagan\u2019s actions to Congress.15 Judge George H. Revercomb (nominated to the federal bench by Ronald Reagan) delivered the opinion, citing the equitable discretion and political question doctrines in this particular case. ", "This Court declines to ... impose a consensus on Congress. Congress is free to adopt a variety of positions on the War Powers Resolution, depending on its ability to achieve a political consensus. If the Court were to intervene in this political process, it would be acting \u2018beyond the limits inherent in the constitutional scheme ...\u2019 Judicial review of the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution is not, however, precluded by this decision. A true confrontation between the Executive and a unified Congress, as evidenced by its passage of legislation to enforce the Resolution, would pose a question ripe for judicial review. (Lowry v. Reagan 1987, 337-339, 341)", "On an expedited appeal, the panel affirmed as a political question (Lowry v. Reagan 1988).16 Yet, in an encouraging turn for member\u2013litigants, this standard was rejected two years later.", "Dellums v. Bush (1990). On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Within a week, the United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq and, on August 25, the UN Security Council authorized \u201csuch measures as may be necessary\u201d to cease and regulate cargo shipping to Iraq. On August 8, Bush announced the deployment of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia in a live televised speech, saying he \u201cshared [meaning communicated] the decision\u201d with Congress. On August 17, 1990, Acting Secretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt sent a letter to Congress (not mentioning the WPR) saying \u201c[i]t is not our intention or expectation that the use of force will be required to carry out these operations. However, if other means of enforcement fail, necessary and proportionate force will be employed to deny passage to ships that are in violation of... sanctions\u201d (Grimmett 2012, 21). On November 8, 150,000 additional troops were sent to the Gulf. Bush sent a second report to Congress over a week later describing the continuing and increasing deployment of forces to the region but said hostilities were not imminent, in part due to the massive buildup. In this phase, called Operation Desert Shield, around 350,000 U.S. troops were eventually deployed.17", "In response, 53 members of the House and one senator (all Democrats) filed an injunctive suit against the president to prevent his going to war against Iraq without explicit congressional consent. Dellums v. Bush was rejected for ripeness by district judge Harold Greene (a Carter appointee). Judge Greene said it is up to the other branches to parse the diplomatic and military meaning of \u201cwar,\u201d but at a certain scale, the label clearly applies. Judge Greene explored the history of member litigation on war and concluded that political question, standing, and equitable discretion precedents did not apply here. The hurdle for the members was simply ripeness. Rejecting the administration\u2019s argument, Greene implies that there is a door to future litigation if a president\u2019s claim of unilateral authority is clearly out of line with the Constitution.", "If the Executive had the sole power to determine that any particular offensive military operation, no matter how vast, does not constitute war-making but only an offensive military attack, the congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a semantic decision by the Executive. Such an \u2018interpretation\u2019 would evade the plain language of the Constitution, and it cannot stand ... here the forces involved are of such magnitude and significance as to present no serious claim that a war would not ensue if they became engaged in combat, and it is therefore clear that congressional approval is required if Congress desires to become involved. (Dellums v. Bush 1990, 1145)", "The ripeness challenge came from the fact that U.S. troops had not yet engaged Iraq. Only around 10% of Congress\u2019s membership signed onto the suit, implying that a majority-sanctioned suit might have a better chance at being heard on the merits (Dellums v. Bush 1990, 1151).18", "Within a month of the federal opinion, on January 8, 1991, President Bush sent a request to the congressional leadership to pass legislation that supported military enforcement of UN Resolution 678, which called for member nations to use force to expel Iraq from Kuwait if it did not do so by January 15, 1991. The AUMF passed with party-line votes in the House (250-183) and Senate (52-47) and said explicitly that the legislation was complying with section 2 of the WPR. President Bush\u2019s signing statement on January 14 said none of the debates, and even the resolution, was interpreted as threatening to his \u201cconstitutional authority to use the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests or [acknowledging] the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.\u201d19 Days later, Bush reported the beginning of combat operations \u201cconsistent with\u201d the WPR (Grimmett 2012, 24).", "Member Litigation after Raines v. Byrd", "The landmark case on Congress members\u2019 standing in court came in 1997. Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) sued to prevent the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 from taking effect. Although the district court sided with Byrd on both justiciability and substance, the Supreme Court reversed on the former, saying members cannot claim an institutional injury stemming from a loss of political power (Raines v. Byrd 1997). The majority opinion, like the war powers precedents, emphasized that Congress has legislative options to recover power. However, the Court found the act unconstitutional the following year on presentment grounds once private interests claimed injury (Clinton v. City of New York, 1998; see also Farrier 2004, 2011).", "Campbell v. Clinton (1999-2000). The Republican Congress granted President Clinton item veto power but did not explicitly authorize military action in Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti in his first term (Adler 2000). In Clinton\u2019s second term, however, his military orders related to Kosovo inspired a congressional lawsuit in the final year of the administration. In 1998-99, a move for independence by ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo brought a new wave of conflict and, in 1999, a joint U.S./NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) military response. The story of U.S. action in Kosovo is similar to previous cases discussed here, despite a partisan switch in both branches.", "Judge Greene implied in Dellums that member\u2013plaintiffs would have standing if they voted against a specific engagement abroad that proceeded anyway. That theory was tested in the spring of 1999. On March 24, the NATO air campaign began against targets in Serbia. Clinton announced the action in a national address and submitted a report two days later to Congress, saying it was \u201cpursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive\u201d and the report was \u201cconsistent with the War Powers Resolution.\u201d On April 7, Clinton updated congressional leaders, saying \u201cit is not possible to predict how long [the] operations will continue.\u201d Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly engaged in hostilities, we\u2019re engaged in combat.\u201d20 During the fifth week of strikes, on April 28, 1999, the House voted on multiple resolutions the same day, which ultimately neither declared war, authorized the campaign, nor withdrew forces. The Senate, however, did pass an AUMF. Then, on May 21, 1999, the president signed an emergency supplemental appropriations act that funded the operation.21", "Representative Tom Campbell (R-CA) and over 20 fellow members, almost all Republicans, filed a complaint on May 19, seeking a declaratory judgment that President Clinton violated the WPR and the Constitution. The suit also demanded \u201cthat no later than May 25, 1999, the President must terminate the involvement of the United States Armed Forces in such hostilities unless Congress declares war, or enacts other explicit authorization, or has extended the sixty day period\u201d (Campbell v. Clinton 2000, 33). The suit was dismissed by district court judge Paul Friedman (appointed by Clinton) who reviewed the congressional actions and concluded \u201cplaintiffs have failed to establish a sufficiently genuine impasse between the legislative and executive branches to give them standing. The most that can be said is that Congress is divided about its position on the President\u2019s actions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that [Clinton] has continued ... in the face of that divide\u201d (Campbell v. Clinton 1999, 44).", "The appeals court upheld the district court but was divided on reasoning. The panel offered four opinions among the three judges (an opinion for the court and three concurrences). The panel\u2019s opinion was written by Judge Laurence Silberman (nominated to the appellate court by Ronald Reagan), who said the congressional votes were not sufficiently \u201cnullified\u201d by the president\u2019s actions for an injury. The three judges then went in different directions. In his separate concurrence, Judge Silberman said the appellants\u2019 claim of \u201chostilities\u201d in Yugoslavia does not lend itself to resolution, even if it appears to be true: \u201c[a]ppellants cannot point to any constitutional test for what is war.\u201d Judge Raymond Randolph (nominated by George H. W. Bush) emphasized the principles of standing and mootness. He looked at the totality of the House votes on April 28, saying they were \u201cnot for naught\u201d because Clinton did not introduce ground troops, which he might have if the full war declaration had passed. Judge David S. Tatel (appointed by President Clinton), offered the most sympathetic reading of the member\u2013plaintiffs complaint. Although he agreed with the majority that the standing problems were too severe, overall he said war is justiciable. \u201cSince the earliest years of the nation, courts have not hesitated to determine when military action constitutes \u2018war\u2019\u201d (Campbell v. Clinton 2000, 16-37).", "In interviews, a member and staffer involved in Campbell expressed frustration. They said the lawsuit was designed to bring public attention to Congress\u2019s \u201clack of will\u201d to confront President Clinton on war. \u201cRepublicans pride themselves as constitutionalists. Democrats pride themselves as learning lessons from Vietnam.\u201d Yet \u201cwar brings ... institutional disinterest.\u201d22", "Doe v. Bush (2003). Despite campaigning against Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cnation building,\u201d and promising a \u201chumble foreign policy\u201d in 2000,23 President George W. Bush\u2019s presidency was built on post-9/11 foreign interventions. However, the second Iraq war suit is unlike the previous ones because the Congress debated and passed a resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to decide when/if to invade. A dozen Democratic House members focused on the latter in a lawsuit saying that it is unconstitutional for Congress to delegate away the war powers that are enumerated in Article I. Because the nub of their argument focused on a passed law, and President Bush waited until the AUMF was in place to invade, this case had less promise for the plaintiffs than the others discussed here.24", "Just weeks before the invasion began, the House members, joined by 20 private plaintiffs (active military and their families) tried to prevent the AUMF\u2019s execution.", "They made two somewhat contradictory constitutional claims: Congress delegated too much war power and what they granted to President Bush was not a green light for invasion. Judge Joseph Tauro (nominated by Richard Nixon) agreed with the defendants and dismissed the case as a political question, saying there was no clear conflict between the political branches. Tauro said, \u201cthere is a day to day fluidity in the situation that does not amount to resolute conflict between the branches \u2013 but that does argue against an uninformed judicial intervention\u201d (Doe v. Bush 2003, 440). Circuit judges Sandra Lynch (nominated by Clinton), Conrad Cyr (nominated by Reagan and Bush I) and Norman Stahl (nominated by Bush I) dismissed the case on ripeness rather than the \u201cmurky\u201d political questions (Doe v. Bush 2003, 138). The previous year, however, the Bush administration got a separate member suit dismissed on political question precedent.25", "Kucinich v. Obama (2011). Like President Bush\u2019s flip from candidate to president, Barack Obama\u2019s war powers interpretations changed dramatically from 2007 to 2011 (see Edelson-Deelen 2015). During the \u201cArab Spring\u201d revolts from 2010 to 2011, street protests in Benghazi, Libya, began to turn toward regime change and the ouster of longtime dictator Colonel Muammar Qadhafi. The UN Security Council passed two resolutions that together condemned violence against civilians, encouraged member nations to place asset freezes and travel bans on the Libyan leadership, endorsed the travel bans already being put into place by the Arab League and other regional organizations, introduced a no-fly zone and authorized member states through regional organizations to use \u201call necessary measures\u201d to protect civilians. Operation Odyssey Dawn was a multinational coalition led by the United Stsates in response to the second UN resolution; Operation Unified Protector was the NATO operation that \u201cresponded to the UN call\u201d by enforcing an arms embargo as well as the no-fly zone. On March 31, NATO assumed command for all international operations in Libya.26", "The constitutional question through these months was whether President Barack Obama needed explicit authorization from Congress to engage in this offensive military action abroad. The president and his administration argued that he possessed unilateral authority, bolstered by treaty obligations.27 Echoing the Kosovo situation, Congress neither authorized nor banned action. The mission began on March 19; the president reported to Congress two days later that he \u201cdirected U.S military forces to commence operations to assist an international effort authorized by the United Nations.\u201d The strikes will be \u201climited in their nature, duration, and scope ... I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution. I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.\u201d28 Without any supportive action in Congress, President Obama asserted that the United Nations can \u201cauthorize\u201d members\u2019 military campaigns (which the WPR specifically denies in section 8), and said \u201cit is U.S. policy that Qaddafi needs to go\u201d (Fisher 2013, 240). The administration took the position that the mission was not \u201cwar\u201d in a constitutional sense that required congressional authorization. Nor did President Obama acknowledge explicitly that he was bound to a withdrawal clock under the WPR.29 However, when the 60-day clock expired on May 20, the president wrote to leaders to express support for a resolution passed in the Senate that would authorize the mission. The House did not pass it. A few days before the 90-day clock expired on June 19, the White House said there were no \u201chostilities\u201d without US casualties (for more information on legal position and debates within the administration on this issue, see Edelson and Starr-Deelen 2015; Savage 2011; and Savage and Lander 2011).", "Meanwhile in Congress, several House actions indicated interest in holding the president to the WPR. First, House Concurrent Resolution 51 was introduced by Dennis Kucinich (D-OH, who would soon be the lead plaintiff in the member lawsuit) and said \u201c[p]ursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution ...Congress directs the President to remove the United States Armed Forces from Libya by not later than the date that is 15 days after the date of the adoption of this concurrent resolution.\u201d The resolution failed on the floor 148-265, with bipartisan groups on both sides of the question; the \u201cyea\u201d votes had 87 Republicans and 61 Democrats and the \u201cnay\u201d votes had 144 Republicans and 121 Democrats. Second, on June 3, Speaker John Boehner himself sponsored House Resolution 292, which banned ground troops and passed on a party line vote.", "Third, on June 15, Boehner wrote to warn the president he was about to violate the WPR. The fourth major House action of the month came when Representative Alcee Hastings (D-FL) sponsored a resolution to authorize the mission, which failed 123-295, with only eight Republicans voting \u201caye.\u201d Finally, Representative Tom Rooney (R-FL) sponsored a resolution to de-fund the NATO mission, which also failed 180-238.30 These last two (seemingly contradictory) votes took place on the same day.", "In the middle of this active month, 10 members of the House of Representatives (two Democrats and eight Republicans) filed suit against President Obama on June 15, 2011. The complaint noted that \u201cthe Obama Administration had yet to ask Congress for specific funding [for military action in Libya]\u201d nor sought \u201ca declaration of war from Congress or even congressional approval for [the military action].\u201d Information from the Department of Defense estimated spending around $550 million in the first 10 days of the military engagement, paid for with reallocations (Bennett 2011). Nevertheless, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton (a G. W. Bush appointee) agreed with the defendants, and the case was dismissed in mid-October. Judge Walton rejected the members\u2019 standing to sue as legislators and taxpayers. Citing several previous member lawsuits, he said that the alleged injuries to these 10 plaintiffs are not separate from those that may have been suffered by the other 425 members of the House (Kucinich v. Obama 2011, 113). Therefore, what Kucinich et al. claim is an \u201cinstitutional injury,\u201d which had been dismissed as a standing category in Raines v. Byrd (1997, discussed above). If an institutional injury characterizes the situation, then it should be endorsed by the body, which was precisely what Judge Rosemary Collyer noted in the current suit on enforcement of the ACA, House v. Burwell. The next issue was whether a legitimate conflict arose from the president\u2019s actions in light of congressional votes. Specifically, did President Obama \u201cnullify\u201d any particular congressional action, including the defeat of the authorization bill on June 24? Judge Walton endorsed the Obama administration\u2019s view, saying \u201c[t]he President\u2019s actions, being based on authority totally independent of the June 24, 2011 vote, cannot be construed as actions that nullify a specific Congressional prohibition\u201d (Kucinich v. Obama 2011, 113). The decision came on October 20, 2011. The NATO campaign ended on October 31. Kucinich did not file an appeal. The tenth member war suit failed to disrupt the new order.", "Conclusion", "While federal courts are accused of activism on many policy fronts, war questions meet restraint. Whatever the motivations of federal judges who have formed these multilayered barriers around war powers, the consistency of the judicial position defies ideological polarization on other issues, and transcends change on the bench, majority control of the House and Senate, the occupant of the White House, and even the foreign policy zeitgeist. All this is not to say there is an ideal, rigid model of war powers that is appropriate to all contemporary situations, nor that courts can and should \u201csave\u201d the country, and Congress, from the president. It is not federal court\u2019s burden to uphold the Constitution or WPR alone. But federal courts can take up a future suit and declare a presidential action unconstitutional pending congressional approval within a certain period of time, possibly prompting a national policy debate that will put House and Senate members on the record. It is also possible that federal courts could accept a case and rule for the president on the merits, possibly even declaring the WPR unconstitutional. In the meantime, presidential assertiveness is supported by default through congressional ambivalence and judicial discomfort or disinterest (Keynes 1982; Koh 1990).", "All three branches and both parties have contributed to our nation\u2019s flipped understanding of constitutional war. After-the-fact public criticism, oversight hearings and investigations, and party changes in the White House and Congress have not changed this dynamic. Today, in addition to bombing ISIS targets since August 2014, President Obama has sent 3,500 troops and special operations advisors to the field by October 2015 with one commando death thus far (Baker, Cooper, and Sanger 2015). The president has chided Congress repeatedly for not sending a new AUMF, but neither branch has said the lack of explicit authorization matters. These postures support modern constitutional interpretations that have received remarkably little outcry or debate. Unlike marriage, health care, campaign finance, privacy, and many other high-profile legal conflicts that ricochet through the branches, public discourse, and elections for years (and even decades at a time), Congress\u2019s war powers are actually enumerated in the Constitution.

Today, the US is fighting conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and beyond. The recent US military strikes on Syria \u2013 which could have resulted in escalation with Russia and Iran \u2013 did not have congressional approval.

Since North Korea shut down its 880-mile border with China in January due to the COVID-19 outbreak, analysis of this latest episode was further muddled by a lack of firsthand reporting and on-the-ground contacts. While North Korean state media shared images of Kim Jong-un celebrating the completion of a fertilizer factory last weekend, his sudden re-emergence leaves us with more questions than answers. As a morbidly obese chain smoker with a family history of cardiovascular problems, Kim Jong-un\u2019s health is a geopolitical ticking time bomb for which we are woefully unprepared. This recent absence highlights our lack of knowledge not only about his individual health status, including if he experienced a medical emergency, but also \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 about critical aspects of regime stability, including succession, control of North Korea\u2019s nuclear stockpile, and plans with key regional actors such as South Korea, China and Japan. Rumors of Kim Jong-un\u2019s possible demise spurred much speculation regarding who would take the helm following his death, which is likely to spark a powerful clash of ambitions among top leaders in Pyongyang. Given her prominent role in foreign relations of late, many analysts predicted that Kim\u2019s younger sister \u2013 Kim Yo Jong \u2013 may be first in line to take his place, but the deeply patriarchal nature of North Korean society means that concerns about her age and gender cannot be easily dismissed. Other family members with ties to the sacred Mt. Paektu bloodline exist and could vie for ruling power amongst each other or perhaps against other party elites or military brass. The truth is \u2013 we don\u2019t know, and the lack of a clear succession plan could lead to a power struggle that threatens the North Korean people and broader regional security. We need to gain more insight into that top tier of candidates who may replace Kim so that we are not blindly grasping at straws for intelligence about a nuclear adversary. Chief among those regional security concerns is control of North Korea\u2019s nuclear stockpile. Estimates about the size of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal range from 20-80 bombs, based on the amount of nuclear materials the North is believed to have produced. In the event of instability above the 38th parallel, it is far too easy to imagine how these weapons fall into the wrong hands. If there is a command and control collapse, officials jockeying for power may launch missiles to garner legitimacy, renegade scientists could start selling off weapons to the highest bidder, and/or terrorist groups could gain access to fissile material that could endanger the masses. In such a scenario where troops must be sent in to restore order, the United States must have a clear sense of the roles for each of the key regional actors to avoid escalating a nuclear crisis into a nuclear war. Ongoing dialogue with these stakeholders is essential to ensure that there is an operational plan in place if the North Korean regime collapses. While the U.S. and South Korea have discussed such a plan for joint military actions, it is unclear whether the Trump and Moon administrations remain committed to it, especially in light of stalled defense cost sharing talks between our two countries. Furthermore, we must insist that China be more forthcoming about its own contingency plans at both the working level and at the highest levels. Unfortunately, when it comes to China, Trump is a corrupt quartermaster. He is singularly focused on skimming flimsy trade deals off the top while ignoring the duty he has to the broader security imperatives of our global competition with China. And if we don\u2019t have China\u2019s cooperation on nuclear security plans, there will be chaos in a North Korean leadership vacuum. The United States must prioritize close coordination with China, as well as South Korea and Japan, regarding the future of North Korea. For now, Kim Jong-un appears to be back in charge, but we should take no solace in that development. Despite President Trump\u2019s misguided love affair with the dictator, Kim\u2019s leadership of the North Korean regime has spelled disaster for North Korean human rights and overseen a dramatic expansion of the regime\u2019s development of nuclear weapons.

As\u00a0\u00a0of the Institute for International Security Studies points out, the United States\u2019 nuclear umbrella and policy of extended deterrence have provided reassurances to Seoul and Tokyo about their security posture. Both countries would likely pursue a nuclear option if they believed that the security assurances of the United States were in doubt. At the same time, both South Korea and Japan have refrained from developing nuclear weapons despite North Korea\u2019s continued pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. If the possession of nuclear weapons by a neighboring state were an indicator of a country\u2019s likelihood of developing nuclear weapons, one would have expected South Korea and Japan to already have done so. Ultimately, a Trump administration policy of weakening U.S. security commitments to Seoul and Tokyo would likely do more to encourage them to develop a nuclear weapons program than anything North Korea has done to date. If the U.S. nuclear umbrella and extended deterrence can reassure U.S. allies and therefore also help to constrain nuclear proliferation, is Trump right to suggest that it is a burden that the United States can no longer afford? As  at the Washington Post points out, the United States is wealthy enough to pay for domestic needs and a robust presence abroad. Since 1950, U.S. GDP has risen from $2.2 trillion to $16.3 trillion last year in inflation adjusted terms. At the same time, Japan\u2019s per capita GDP is only 69 percent of the United States\u2019 and South Korea\u2019s less so. While a debate over the best usage of resources in any society is legitimate, the United States is clearly wealthy enough to meet its commitments abroad should society at large deem them to be beneficial. More to Trump\u2019s point about burden sharing, South Korea already contributes a great deal to the alliance in contrast to what he has suggested. Seoul provides  of the non-personnel costs for stationing U.S. troops in South Korea, including annual increases. It spends , 2.6 percent of GDP, than any other ally in Europe and Asia, and fields an active military of 630,000 troops through conscription. South Korea has also historically contributed troops to assist the U.S. in past wars and peace keeping missions than any ally other than the United Kingdom and a few others. This brings us to the last of Trump\u2019s arguments, that the United States does not benefit enough from its commitments abroad. Is this the case? As previously noted, U.S. commitments to our allies have helped constrain nuclear proliferation, but the United States benefits in other ways as well. U.S. commitments abroad provide necessary stability around the world to maintain the peace and order that helps to enable the international commerce necessary for U.S. prosperity. U.S. bases abroad also provide forward positioning to allow the United States to deal with military threats abroad before they endanger the homeland. At the same time, the idea of allowing South Korea and Japan to develop nuclear weapons to lessen the burden on the United States would face a series of constraints and concerns. As we have noted on  , there are real economic and foreign policy constraints on South Korea developing a nuclear weapon. Many of these would apply to Japan as well. Seoul and Tokyo would need to either violate their commitments to or withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). If they, along with Saudi Arabia and other countries, did so as a result of Trump\u2019s policy, it would likely be the end of the NPT and increase nuclear proliferation worldwide. This has significant security implications for the United States, especially as it relates to terrorism. As more states develop nuclear programs there will increasingly be more states with access to fissile material that a bad actor could utilize to threaten peace and stability."], "id": "818dc35c482f51ef024157b38e78edab07b3258ea44870c0ad93b14d8d7978ef", "highlighted_text": " the U S umbrella provided reassurances to Seoul about their security Both would pursue a nuclear option if they believed security assurances were in doubt weakening U.S. commitments would do more to encourage nuclear weapons than anything No Ko has done U.S. commitments constrain prolif commitments provide stability to maintain peace allowing So Ko Seoul would violate the N P T If they did it would be the end of the NPT and increase prolif worldwide", "highlights": [[2, 142, 147], [2, 153, 154], [2, 169, 177], [2, 217, 247], [2, 258, 278], [2, 288, 292], [2, 303, 308], [2, 316, 339], [2, 340, 356], [2, 366, 385], [2, 407, 420], [2, 837, 851], [2, 861, 872], [2, 892, 897], [2, 905, 915], [2, 916, 925], [2, 944, 959], [2, 968, 984], [2, 988, 990], [2, 994, 1002], [2, 2530, 2546], [2, 2573, 2582], [2, 2591, 2597], [2, 2665, 2676], [2, 2684, 2691], [2, 2702, 2711], [2, 2729, 2740], [2, 2745, 2750], [2, 3020, 3031], [2, 3035, 3037], [2, 3335, 3340], [2, 3351, 3356], [2, 3372, 3379], [2, 3418, 3421], [2, 3422, 3423], [2, 3434, 3435], [2, 3448, 3449], [2, 3462, 3469], [2, 3516, 3519], [2, 3554, 3562], [2, 3570, 3580], [2, 3581, 3591], [2, 3592, 3604], [2, 3613, 3619], [2, 3627, 3636]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 72], [2, 142, 147], [2, 147, 152], [2, 153, 154], [2, 154, 160], [2, 161, 168], [2, 169, 177], [2, 178, 216], [2, 217, 247], [2, 248, 257], [2, 258, 278], [2, 279, 286], [2, 286, 287], [2, 288, 292], [2, 293, 302], [2, 303, 308], [2, 309, 315], [2, 316, 339], [2, 339, 339], [2, 340, 356], [2, 357, 365], [2, 366, 385], [2, 386, 406], [2, 407, 420], [2, 420, 421], [2, 421, 421], [2, 792, 836], [2, 837, 851], [2, 852, 860], [2, 861, 872], [2, 873, 881], [2, 882, 891], [2, 892, 897], [2, 898, 904], [2, 905, 915], [2, 915, 915], [2, 916, 925], [2, 926, 941], [2, 942, 943], [2, 944, 959], [2, 960, 967], [2, 968, 984], [2, 984, 987], [2, 988, 990], [2, 990, 993], [2, 994, 1002], [2, 1003, 1010], [2, 2530, 2546], [2, 2547, 2572], [2, 2573, 2582], [2, 2583, 2590], [2, 2591, 2597], [2, 2597, 2604], [2, 2660, 2664], [2, 2665, 2676], [2, 2677, 2683], [2, 2684, 2691], [2, 2691, 2691], [2, 2692, 2701], [2, 2702, 2711], [2, 2712, 2728], [2, 2729, 2740], [2, 2741, 2744], [2, 2745, 2750], [2, 2751, 2760], [2, 2990, 3019], [2, 3020, 3031], [2, 3031, 3034], [2, 3035, 3037], [2, 3037, 3044], [2, 3045, 3167], [2, 3335, 3340], [2, 3341, 3350], [2, 3351, 3356], [2, 3357, 3371], [2, 3371, 3371], [2, 3372, 3379], [2, 3380, 3417], [2, 3418, 3421], [2, 3422, 3423], [2, 3423, 3434], [2, 3434, 3435], [2, 3435, 3447], [2, 3448, 3449], [2, 3449, 3460], [2, 3462, 3469], [2, 3469, 3515], [2, 3516, 3519], [2, 3520, 3521], [2, 3521, 3553], [2, 3554, 3562], [2, 3563, 3569], [2, 3570, 3580], [2, 3580, 3580], [2, 3581, 3591], [2, 3591, 3591], [2, 3592, 3604], [2, 3605, 3612], [2, 3613, 3619], [2, 3619, 3626], [2, 3627, 3636]], "emphasis": [[2, 316, 339], [2, 2692, 2701], [2, 2702, 2711], [2, 2745, 2750], [2, 2751, 2760], [2, 3422, 3423], [2, 3434, 3435], [2, 3448, 3449], [2, 3570, 3580], [2, 3613, 3619], [2, 3619, 3626], [2, 3627, 3636]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10], [11, 13]], "filename": "neg-3.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2016-01-01"}, {"tag": "Allied prolif causes nuclear war", "cite": "McKenzie 20 [Pete McKenzie is an independent journalist based in New Zealandk, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Allies Are Becoming a Nuclear-Proliferation Threat,\u201d 3-25, , y2k]", "body": ["Opening the box Experts emphasize that the risk of allies rapidly nuclearizing is low. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of hurdles that [allies] would have to get very powerfully motivated to overcome,\u201d said Michael Mazarr, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. But Volpe observed that \u201copening that box and having to ask those questions about the U.S. commitment is worrisome\u2026The proliferation risk is low. The problem is that it\u2019s increased. It was an almost 0 percent risk for a long time, and the reason there\u2019s lots of interest is that that risk has gone up in a noticeable way.\u201d Moreover, that risk will grow. According to Nicholas Miller, assistant professor of government at Dartmouth: \u201cThere are geopolitical trends that are making this happen, and are going to make it increasingly common\u2026The shift towards multipolarity with the rise of China, the relative decline of the U.S, and Russia behaving increasingly assertively\u2014that all makes a lot of our allies feel more insecure. That\u2019s going to persist, so these conversations will continue.\u201d Part of the Trump administration\u2019s legacy will be the corrosion of America\u2019s ability to control those risks. Previous administrations restrained proliferation by denying other governments access to technology, coercing them through threats, and reassuring them through commitments. But the rise of Russian and Chinese nuclear-technology providers has made the first option far less effective. And it would be counterproductive to coerce already-nervous allies with the type of confrontational strategies used against states like Iran and North Korea. The only useful tool the next president will have is reassurance, itself badly dulled by the current president. \u201cFrom an allied perspective, you look at the U.S. and you think, \u2018Well, for four years I\u2019ll get assurance, but then the administration will change and the commitment might die again\u2019,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for the next administration to recommit to U.S. obligations.\u201d The consequences of proliferation among allies are dire.

The Kim regime has repeatedly struck out at the South\u2014see the 2010 sinking of the Korean navy vessel\u00a0Cheonan\u00a0that killed 46 sailors and the shelling of Yongpyong Island. Yet the North has refrained from large-scale attacks against either South Korea or Japan, another target of Pyongyang\u2019s ire, despite its significant missile capability and larger military. Washington interprets this as due, at least in part, to the assumption by all parties that a major attack, or full-scale war, would immediately trigger the self-defense clause of the mutual defense treaty between the United States and South Korea. If that is the case, then the U.S. commitment will be even more important: Only a firm U.S. promise to defend the South will deter the North.", "But if, on the other hand, the United States decided that the risk to its interests was prohibitively high, abrogating or scaling back the alliance would potentially destabilize Asia and beyond. It would hand the Kim regime a major strategic victory, removing the single greatest deterrent to its aggression. Pyongyang would be emboldened to continue trying to blackmail the United States, South Korea, and Japan, leading to future crises. Stripped of the assurance provided by America\u2019s support, South Korea might wind up capitulating to the North\u2019s demands for open-ended economic assistance, or even stand down some of its forces. Japan would worry that it may be the next to be abandoned by America. Even worse, in the face of a U.S. withdrawal, both Seoul and Tokyo would immediately begin considering developing their own nuclear and missile programs, instigating a nuclear-arms race that would spill over to China, Taiwan, and possibly beyond.", "In the event of a reduced American presence in northeast Asia, China would emerge the big winner. Beijing almost certainly would offer Seoul an alliance of its own, further undermining America\u2019s regional web of alliances, likely tipping the Philippines and Malaysia fully into the Chinese camp. Japanese government officials I spoke to expressed their fears that, in the event of the collapse of the U.S.-South Korea alliance, Beijing may even base Chinese warships in Busan, the southern port closest to Japan, giving China a foothold on the territory closest to the Japanese home islands\u2014historically, Japan\u2019s major geopolitical fear. Access to the southern Korean coastline would enhance China\u2019s ability to control the strategic waterways from the South China Sea through the East China Sea and into the Sea of Japan. The Japanese would consider this a grave threat. In response, the U.S. resources diverted from the Korean peninsula might be redeployed to blunt China\u2019s expansion, including a beefing-up of the U.S. Navy in Japan, which would increase Sino-U.S. tensions and the potential for a maritime confrontation in the narrow, strategic Tsushima Strait.", "Cutting South Korea adrift would likely also have global repercussions for America. Other nuclear or potential nuclear states would learn from Pyongyang\u2019s success, opening America up to future nuclear blackmail. Just as significantly, walking away from a long-term ally would make the United States seem capricious and untrustworthy; attempting to maintain America\u2019s worldwide alliance system might become impossible, as no reassurances would be sufficient for jittery partners.", "Such fears explain the criticism of Donald Trump, precisely for his questioning of the value of Washington\u2019s long-standing alliances with South Korea and other nations, during the 2016 presidential campaign. Experts cautioned that ending U.S. alliance commitments would \u201cunravel\u00a0the entire post-World War II order,\u201d while seasoned diplomats warned that America was not engaged in an alliance \u201c,\u201d but rather benefitted from the global stability that engendered trade and globalization since 1945.", "Despite his campaign rhetoric, Trump appeared to acknowledge the importance of the South Korean alliance once in office. His administration walked back his more radical suggestions, mollifying the national-security establishment. Both Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance. Even more strikingly, the administration soon made North Korea a critical national-security issue, even claiming that it was the \u201c\u201d threat facing the United States, and that \u201call\u00a0\u00a0are on the table\u201d for dealing with the rogue nation.", "Yet even if Trump has decided to embrace the South Korean alliance, there are numerous reasons to be worried about the liabilities that come with it."], "id": "e31bdaf2a2daa918502d261349a8aae54283e9a05113770b20995afac8077081", "highlighted_text": " maintaining a strong alliance rest on deterrent effect against No Ko

The existing works give a misleading impression that resource incomes can cover easily invasion, investment and international costs of wars. Third, the existing works consider approximately most resource states to be more or less equal entities. Although such states may have equal rights from juridical perspective, they share too many diverse features to be considered equal entities in other empirical terms. For example, while Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia have rich natural resources, they are dissimilar in a number of other important ways. However, both qualitative and quantitative analyses neglect this factor while explaining the resource-conflict nexus. Therefore, it is unwise to lump different case studies together in the same category without considering the particular characteristics of the region or country in question. Moreover, wide part of the existing works adopts a national-level approach by portraying abundancy, scarcity and conflict at the unitary state-level. Nevertheless, natural resources are distributed inconsistently over a nation\u2019s territory.

The standards body, which certifies certain fisheries as sustainable as a guide for consumers, said that on current trends cod would soon qualify for its certification. Richard Benyon, the fisheries minister, recently confessed to the Guardian that cod \u2013 in batter, with mushy peas \u2013 was his favourite fish. But cod aficionados will have to wait a bit longer before tucking in with a clear conscience: stocks will not be sustainable for at least a year and possibly two or three, said Claire Pescod of the MSC: \"Things are a lot better than they were, but we can't let up just yet.\" Chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall said he would be waiting for a full certification by the MSC before putting cod back on the menu. \"I'm more keen than anyone to see British cod back on the 'fish to eat' list, but I can't in good conscience promote eating fish from a stock that it is still below what scientists consider safe limits, while fishermen still have to throw much of it back dead into the sea,\" he said. \"If you know your cod is from a boat catching in a selective and low-impact way, or a trawler on the CCTV scheme for discard-free cod, then that's the best choice you can make for British cod.\" Some green campaigners were cautious, saying a full recovery could still take many years. Paul de Zylva of Friends of the Earth said: \"We would expect some recovery of cod stocks because of the closure of the North Sea cod fisheries. But this does not mean stocks have recovered to high enough levels. \"We're in this near extinction mess \u2013 and the North Sea cod fisheries were closed \u2013 precisely because industrial commercial fishing has stripped fish stock to the bone. The UK used to be self-sufficient in fish for all 12 months of the year. Now we're using our own fish stocks for just six months.\" He said taking species off the danger list too soon would just repeat the cycle of overfishing. \"It's pointless to declare that cod and other species are recovering if they are still far from being at safe levels where adult fish reproduce, their offspring survive and overall levels are sustained.\" A handful of other species that have been overfished are also showing signs of improvement: Dover sole caught using trammel nets in the western channel, North Sea herring caught by drift net, and cockles from the Thames Estuary. But red gurnard may be less safe than thought \u2013 there is not enough data, according to the MSC, to say for certain how stocks are faring. The brighter prospect for cod comes in Project Inshore, a survey of 450 of the UK's inshore fishing grounds carried out by the MSC and other fishing organisations, with government backing. The organisation said: \"Cod stocks in the North Sea \u2013 often perceived as a species to avoid \u2013 continue to show a strong recovery and are now close to a level where they could meet the MSC standard. The report shows that strong management measures have made a positive impact and that \u2013 once stocks have reached the required levels \u2013 all other areas of the fisheries are ready to enter an MSC full assessment.\""], "id": "46f20cdddaa1285723380a82d01a7b460d412ce4662837d224a8b7ce9380ce74", "highlighted_text": " Cod could be in for a revival effective management means increasing other species are also showing signs of improvement strong recovery strong management made a  positive impact other fisheries are ready to enter an MSC full assessment", "highlights": [[3, 0, 29], [5, 101, 110], [5, 111, 121], [5, 122, 127], [5, 135, 145], [5, 2254, 2267], [5, 2294, 2297], [5, 2298, 2331], [5, 2910, 2916], [5, 2917, 2925], [5, 3017, 3034], [5, 3049, 3055], [5, 3055, 3055], [5, 3056, 3071], [5, 3134, 3139], [5, 3153, 3204]], "underlines": [[3, 0, 29], [5, 6, 15], [5, 20, 21], [5, 27, 28], [5, 39, 40], [5, 87, 95], [5, 101, 110], [5, 110, 110], [5, 111, 121], [5, 121, 121], [5, 122, 127], [5, 128, 134], [5, 135, 145], [5, 147, 165], [5, 173, 182], [5, 191, 215], [5, 252, 292], [5, 2254, 2267], [5, 2294, 2297], [5, 2297, 2297], [5, 2298, 2331], [5, 2333, 2369], [5, 2394, 2431], [5, 2437, 2449], [5, 2454, 2460], [5, 2612, 2662], [5, 2664, 2675], [5, 2687, 2715], [5, 2821, 2848], [5, 2903, 2907], [5, 2910, 2916], [5, 2916, 2916], [5, 2917, 2925], [5, 2926, 2933], [5, 2938, 2946], [5, 2972, 2993], [5, 3017, 3034], [5, 3049, 3055], [5, 3056, 3071], [5, 3134, 3139], [5, 3153, 3204], [5, 3204, 3206]], "emphasis": [[5, 20, 21], [5, 27, 28], [5, 39, 40], [5, 2910, 2916], [5, 2916, 2916], [5, 2917, 2925], [5, 3017, 3034], [5, 3056, 3071]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "neg-3.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2013-06-07"}, {"tag": "No Yellow Sea escalation", "cite": "Morris 2016 - Senior Policy Analyst @ RAND Lyle, \"South Korea Cracks Down on Illegal Chinese Fishing, with Violent Results,\" https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/11/south-korea-cracks-down-on-illegal-chinese-fishing.html", "body": ["In part as a consequence of Chinese illegal fishing, the KCG has embarked on a modest ship building program to procure nine vessels (eight 500-ton and one 3,000-ton) to support the Korean shipbuilding industry and strengthen maritime sovereignty and governance.

Any state rational enough to seek to avoid retaliation for a nuclear attack would recognize the incredible risk that this strategy entails. In the wake of an act of nuclear terrorism, facing an enraged and vindictive victim, would the state sponsor step forward to admit that its weapons or materials were used to attack a staunch enemy, with the hope that the victim would believe a story about theft and grant clemency on those grounds? If that logic does not appear implausible enough, recall that no state would be likely to give its nuclear weapons or materials to a terrorist organization with which it did not have a long record of cooperation and trust. Thus, a state sponsor acknowledging that it was the source of materials used in a nuclear attack would be doing so in light of its enemies\u2019 knowledge that the terrorists who allegedly [End Page 96] stole the materials happened to have been its close collaborators in prior acts of terrorism. This strategy would be nearly as suicidal as launching a direct nuclear attack.37", "The second strategy\u2014giving nuclear weapons to terrorists and then hiding behind the possibility that they were stolen from some unspecified insecure foreign source\u2014deserves greater scrutiny. The list of potential global sources of fissile material seems long. Nine countries possess nuclear weapons, and eleven more have enough fissile material to fashion a crude fission device.38 In 2011 the world\u2019s stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU), the fissile material most likely to be sought by terrorists,39 was about 1.3 million kilograms, meaning that the material needed for a single crude weapon could be found within the rounding error of the rounding error of global stocks. Perhaps, therefore, nearly all twenty countries with sufficient stocks of fissile material would need to join the lineup of suspects after a terrorist nuclear attack, not as possible sponsors but as potential victims of theft. And if enough fissile material to make a nuclear weapon could be purloined from any of these countries, [End Page 97] then perhaps the victim would be unable to rule out all possible sources and thus be unable to punish the real culprit.", "This gloomy picture overstates the difficulty of determining the source of stolen material after a nuclear terrorist attack. In the wake of a detonation, the possibility of stolen fissile material complicates the task of attribution\u2014but only marginally. At the end of the Cold War, several countries\u2014particularly in the former Soviet Union\u2014confronted major nuclear security problems, but great progress has been made since then.40 Although no country has perfect nuclear security, today the greatest concerns surround just five countries: Belarus, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, and South Africa.41 In addition, not all of those states are equally worrisome as potential sources of nuclear theft. Substantial concerns exist about the security of fissile materials in Pakistan and Russia (the latter if simply because of the large size of its stockpile), but Belarus, Japan, and South Africa would likely be quickly and easily ruled out as the source of stolen fissile material. Belarus has a relatively small stockpile of fissile material\u2014approximately 100 kilograms of HEU42 \u2014so in the wake of a nuclear terrorist attack, it would be easy for Belarus to show that its stockpile remained intact.43 Similarly, Japan (one of the United States\u2019 closest allies) and [End Page 98] South Africa would be keen to allow the United States to verify the integrity of their full stocks of materials. (In the wake of a nuclear terror attack, a lack of full cooperation in showing all materials accounted for would be highly revealing.) Iran is not believed to have any weapons-usable nuclear material to steal,44 although that could change. In short, a nuclear handoff strategy disguised as a loose nukes problem would be very precarious.45", "Counterargument #2: Conventional Versus Nuclear Attribution", "The evidence presented above shows that the perpetrators of terror attacks against the United States or its allies in which ten or more people are killed on home territory are almost always identified. But these data are based solely on conventional terror attacks. Might acts of nuclear terror be harder to attribute than their conventional cousins?", "With no actual cases of nuclear terrorism to examine, it is impossible to know for sure how the challenges of attribution after a nuclear attack would compare to the difficult police and intelligence work that led to attribution in the thousands of cases of conventional terrorism. Logic suggests at least one reason why it might be harder to identify the perpetrators of nuclear terrorism, but many other factors suggest that nuclear attribution would be easier than solving conventional incidents of terrorism. Taken together, these arguments suggest that the data presented above may well understate the actual likelihood of nuclear attribution.", "Identifying the perpetrators of a nuclear terror attack, as opposed to a conventional terror incident, would be harder because a nuclear detonation would destroy much of the evidence near the site of the attack. In the aftermath of a conventional bombing, investigators check nearby security cameras for images of the attackers, sift through the debris to recover physical evidence, and interview witnesses. This sort of evidence has proved useful in several terror investigations. For instance, investigators found the vehicle identification number (VIN) from the trucks used to bomb the World Trade Center in 1993 and to destroy the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.46 A nuclear detonation, however, would leave little (if any) of such evidence. [End Page 99]", "Although investigators always prefer to have physical evidence from the scene of a bombing, in high-profile investigations such evidence is used in conjunction with vast quantities of other data: for example, information about the activities of terror groups already under surveillance before the attack; intercepted cellphone and internet communications; reports from agents embedded with known terror groups; and similar types of information shared by friendly governments. In fact, while the VIN number was useful in solving the 1993 World Trade Center attack, it was far less important in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation, because the key suspect was in custody before the on-site evidence was gathered. Nevertheless, the loss of evidence from the attack site would complicate the attribution of a nuclear terror attack relative to a conventional terror incident.", "There are at least five reasons, however, to expect that attributing a nuclear terrorist attack would be easier than attributing a conventional terrorist attack. First, no terrorism investigation in history has had the resources that would be deployed to investigating the source of a nuclear terror attack\u2014particularly one against the United States or a U.S. ally. Rapidly attributing the attack would be critical, not merely as a first step toward satisfying the rage of the victims but, more importantly, to determine whether additional nuclear attacks were imminent. The victim would use every resource at its disposal\u2014money, threats, and force\u2014to rapidly identify the source of the attack.47 If necessary, any investigation would go on for a long time; it would never \u201cblow over\u201d from the victim\u2019s standpoint.", "The second reason why attributing a nuclear terror attack would be easier than attributing a conventional terrorist attack is the level of international assistance the victim would likely receive from allies, neutrals, and even adversaries. An attack on the United States, for example, would likely trigger unprecedented intelligence cooperation from its allies, if for no other reason than the fear that subsequent attacks might target them. Perhaps more important, even adversaries of the United States\u2014particularly those with access to fissile materials\u2014would have enormous incentives to quickly demonstrate their innocence. To avoid being accused of sponsoring or supporting the attack, and thus to avoid the wrath of the United States, these countries would likely go to great lengths to demonstrate that their weapons were accounted for, that their fissile materials had different isotopic properties than the type used in the attack, and that they were sharing any information they had on the [End Page 100] attack. The cooperation that the United States received from Iran and Pakistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks illustrates how potential adversaries may be motivated to help in the aftermath of an attack and stay off the target list for retaliation.48 The pressure to cooperate after an anonymous nuclear detonation on U.S. soil would be many times greater.49", "Third, the strong positive relationship between the number of fatalities stemming from an attack and the rate of attribution (as depicted in figures 1 to 3 above) suggests that the probability of attribution after a nuclear attack\u2014with its enormous casualties\u2014should be even higher. The 97 percent attribution rate for attacks that killed ten or more people on U.S. soil or that of its allies is based on a set of attacks that were pinpricks compared to nuclear terrorism. The data in those figures suggest that our conclusions understate the actual likelihood of nuclear attribution.", "Fourth, the challenge of attribution after a terrorist nuclear attack should be easier than after a conventional terrorist attack, because the investigation would begin with a highly restricted suspect list. In the case of a conventional terror attack against the United States or an ally, one might begin the investigation at the broadest level with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s list of fifty-one foreign terrorist organizations. In the case of a nuclear terror attack, only fifteen of these FTOs have state sponsors\u2014and only one sponsor (Pakistan) has either nuclear weapons or fissile materials. (If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, that number will grow to two, but there is no overlap between the terror groups that Pakistan supports and those that Iran assists.)", "Finally, any operation to detonate a nuclear weapon would involve complex planning and coordination\u2014securing the weapon, learning to use it, planning the time and location of detonation, moving the weapon to the target, and conducting the attack. Even if only a small cadre of operatives knew the nuclear nature of the attack, the planning of a spectacular operation would be hard to keep [End Page 101] secret.50 For example, six months prior to the September 11 attacks, Western intelligence detected numerous indications that al-Qaida was planning a major attack. The intelligence was not specific enough\u2014or the agencies were not nimble enough\u2014to prevent the operation, but the indicators were \u201cblinking red\u201d for months, directing U.S. attention to al-Qaida as soon as the attacks began.51", "Counterargument #3: Uncertainty and Failed Deterrence", "Skeptics of our confidence in the feasibility of post-nuclear attack attribution might emphasize the role of uncertainty in constraining the response of the victim. Attribution, after all, is not a binary outcome but a matter of probabilities. Each of the cases of \u201csuccessful attribution\u201d in the data we used reflects a consensus among GTD researchers that a particular group carried out an attack\u2014but there are few cases in which the list of the guilty parties is certain. Without such certainty, a victim of nuclear terrorism would arguably be constrained in its response against a suspected sponsor. Believing this, a state comparing the option of a direct nuclear attack to sponsorship of a terrorist strike might prefer the latter, counting on residual attribution uncertainty to dampen the response.", "There are two problems with this counterargument. First, while attribution uncertainty might restrain a state from responding to an act of nuclear terror with a major nuclear retaliatory strike, that option is not the only devastating response available to a country such as the United States or one of its allies. Indeed, regardless of the level of attribution certainty, a nuclear strike might not be the preferred response. For example, in the wake of a nuclear terror attack against the United States thought to be sponsored by Pakistan, Iran, or North Korea, U.S. leaders might not feel compelled to determine those countries\u2019 guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d or to narrow down the suspect list further; Washington might simply decide that the era in which \u201crogue states\u201d possessed nuclear weapons must end, and threaten to conquer any country that refused to disarm or that was less than forthcoming about the terror attack.52", "Second, this counterargument would be unlikely to carry much weight with a leader contemplating nuclear attack by proxy. A leader tempted to attack because of the prospect of residual attribution uncertainty and the hope that such uncertainty would restrain his victim from lashing out in retaliation would need enormous confidence in the humaneness of his enemy, even at a time [End Page 102] when that enemy would be boiling over with rage. For example, could one really imagine an Iranian aide convincing the supreme leader that if Iran gave a nuclear bomb to Hezbollah, knowing that Israel would strongly suspect Iran as the source, Israel\u2019s leaders would be too restrained by their deep humanity and lingering doubts about sponsorship to retaliate harshly against Tehran?", "In fact, the U.S. response to the September 11 attacks, including the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, indicates a willingness to retaliate strongly against those directly culpable (al-Qaida), their associates (the Taliban), and others simply deemed to be troublemakers in the neighborhood (Iraq). There was debate in the United States over the strategic wisdom of invading Iraq, but none of Saddam Hussein\u2019s crimes\u2014either known, suspected, or fabricated\u2014were held to an evidentiary standard even close to certainty.53 States that consider giving nuclear weapons to terrorists cannot be certain how the victim will react, but basing one\u2019s hope for survival on a victim\u2019s reluctance to act on partial evidence of culpability would be a tremendous gamble.", "A nuclear terror strike would have momentous consequences. In the case of an attack on the United States, such a strike would draw the full investigative, diplomatic, and military might of the world\u2019s only superpower. In that environment, the incentives for allies, neutrals, and adversaries to cooperate would be immense. Therefore, the data offered in figures 1 to 3 (which show attribution rates after attacks that are, by comparison to a nuclear event, mere pinpricks) probably greatly underestimate the odds of attribution. Uncertainties about the full list of possible accomplices might endure, but the notion that a victim of a nuclear terrorist attack would be paralyzed by those uncertainties is far-fetched.", "Conclusion", "President Obama has identified nuclear terrorism as \u201cthe single biggest threat to U.S. security,\u201d describing it as \u201csomething that could change the security landscape of this country and around the world for years to come.\u201d54 The prospect of an adversary state covertly giving a nuclear weapon or nuclear materials to a terrorist organization has been the animating force in U.S. grand strategy for more than a decade. The scenario was used to justify the invasion of Iraq and toppling of the Iraqi regime in 2003; and in 2012 and 2013, proponents of a preventive military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities frequently argued that such attacks are necessary to eliminate the possibility of Iran trying a [End Page 103] nuclear attack by proxy against Israel or the United States. We demonstrate here that such fears are overblown. The rationale for state sponsorship of nuclear terrorism lacks sound deductive logic and is empirically unsupported by the most relevant available evidence.", "The United States and its allies should be able to deter nuclear-armed states from passing their weapons to terrorists, because a terrorist nuclear strike would not remain anonymous for long and would soon be traced back to the originating state. This conclusion is based on two empirical findings. First, among the relevant past cases of conventional terrorist attacks\u2014those targeting the homelands of powerful states and causing significant casualties\u2014almost all were successfully attributed to the perpetrating terrorist organization. Second, linking the attributed terrorist organization to a state sponsor would not be difficult. Few foreign terrorist organizations have state sponsors; those that do typically have only one; and only one suspected state sponsor of terrorism (Pakistan) has nuclear weapons or sufficient stockpiles of nuclear materials.", "Furthermore, potential sponsors of nuclear terror face a wicked dilemma: to maintain distance by passing the weapon to a terrorist group they do not know well or trust, or to maintain control by giving it to a group they have cooperated with repeatedly. The former strategy is mind-bogglingly dangerous; the latter option makes attribution from terror group to sponsor simple.", "Our findings have two important policy implications. First, the fear of nuclear attack by proxy by itself does not justify costly military steps to prevent nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation may pose a variety of other risks, and the appropriate level of U.S. efforts to stop proliferation should depend on the cumulative effect of these risks, but the dangers of a nuclear handoff to terrorists have been overstated. For example, Iranian leaders would have to be crazy or suicidal to think that they could give a nuclear weapon to one of their terrorist collaborators and face no repercussions. If leaders were that irrational, the bigger problem would be direct nuclear attack without concern for the retaliatory consequences, not the alleged problem of a nuclear handoff."], "id": "75ee9be8500f7bb7e1c775245439d2ce33b8f8794bd425cdc8c798222d7fc3e3", "highlighted_text": " giving nuclear weapons to terrorists and pleading guilty to maintaining inadequate stockpile security \u2014 is dubious.

In democracies, domestic audience costs are thought to sometimes encourage restraint in political leaders, and to strengthen the credibility of threats when leaders of democratic polities make them. A politician who fails to live up to their word, for example, will be punished at the ballot box (this is a theory, not a description of reality). In dictatorships though, the audience cost mechanism as a source of either restraint or credibility doesn\u2019t exist in the same way. The only audiences that might punish or reward a leader are elites who implement orders and are capable of threatening a coup. But in North Korea, Kim Jong Eun seems to be killing all those guys. So even if dictators face audience costs in general\u2014and many scholars think they don\u2019t\u2014North Korea seems a special case in which audience costs are marginal if they exist at all. So if North Korea ends up in an undesirable conflict, Kim Jong Eun and the generals can de-escalate or back down without necessarily losing face. At any rate, North Korea has a history of making threats that it fails to follow through on. The stability-instability paradox was a concept developed during the Cold War to explain how two states can achieve stability at the strategic level through mutually assured destruction but, as a consequence, simultaneously be even freer to pursue small-scale and seemingly low-stakes conflicts like provocations and proxy wars. The odds of a nuclear holocaust were thought to approach zero while low-intensity conflicts became a recurring phenomenon. As North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability improves, the logic of the stability-instability paradox becomes more compelling. Even without delivery vehicles for North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability, some believe that the stability-instability paradox has already reached the Korean Peninsula due to the capacity of both sides to inflict unimaginable atrocities on the other through conventional weapons alone. In short, while there may be incentives for conflict by either side, both sides also have even more compelling incentives to limit the scope of any violence. There are, of course, many chances for miscalculation\u2014especially during a crisis\u2014but there\u2019s no conceivable miscalculation that would reasonably lead to total war without lots of intervening steps and assumptions in between the miscalculation and the nightmare outcome. And if we reason from a place of likelihoods rather than from a place of what\u2019s hypothetically possible, we stand a chance of crafting better policy.

The latest crisis with Iran is helping to bring that very issue to the fore and some new signs of bipartisan consensus have emerged lately. Congress must first resolve its own internal disagreements on presidential war powers or devise new legislation that would offer binding clarity. In the meantime, though, it would be important for policy-makers to consider more seriously the advantages of routinely applying the War Powers Act to US engagements in the Middle East. Submitting US military engagements in the Middle East to votes under the War Powers Act would require a degree of bipartisan congressional consensus that would, in turn, help command broader support from the American public on the purpose, size, composition, and duration of US military commitments in the Middle East. It would also put American allies\u2014particularly those in the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2014on notice that US involvement in their defense (and in their internecine conflicts) comes with limitations prescribed by a broad consensus of the US political system. Failing an agreement between Congress, the White House, and the courts on the routine applicability of the Act, a legal restructuring of the AUMF would serve a similar purpose. As some 2020 presidential candidates have argued, replacing the current authorization with time-limited, renewable joint resolutions\u2014perhaps tailored to specific situations and requiring regular congressional review\u2014would help ensure that both Congress and the White House remain in sync on how, and indeed whether, to pursue military activities in the Middle East.

With Nafta and the Internet and big-box stores selling cheap goods from China, the line between national and international began to blur. In the seven years since 9/11, the question of how we relate to the world beyond our borders \u2014 and how we should \u2014 has become inescapable. The Supreme Court, as ever, is beginning to offer its own answers. As the United States tries to balance the benefits of multilateral alliances with the demands of unilateral self-protection, the court has started to address the legal counterparts of such existential matters. It is becoming increasingly clear that the defining constitutional problem for the present generation will be the nature of the relationship of the United States to what is somewhat optimistically called the international order.", "This problem has many dimensions. It includes mundane practical questions, like what force the United States should give to the law of the sea. It includes more symbolic questions, like whether high-ranking American officials can be held accountable for crimes against international law. And it includes questions of momentous consequence, like whether international law should be treated as law in the United States; what rights, if any, noncitizens have to come before American courts or tribunals; whether the protections of the Geneva Conventions apply to people that the U.S. government accuses of being terrorists; and whether the U.S. Supreme Court should consider the decisions of foreign or international tribunals when it interprets the Constitution.", "In recent years, two prominent schools of thought have emerged to answer these questions. One view, closely associated with the Bush administration, begins with the observation that law, in the age of modern liberal democracy, derives its legitimacy from being enacted by elected representatives of the people. From this standpoint, the Constitution is seen as facing inward, toward the Americans who made it, toward their rights and their security. For the most part, that is, the rights the Constitution provides are for citizens and provided only within the borders of the country. By these lights, any interpretation of the Constitution that restricts the nation\u2019s security or sovereignty \u2014 for example, by extending constitutional rights to noncitizens encountered on battlefields overseas \u2014 is misguided and even dangerous. In the words of the conservative legal scholars Eric Posner and Jack Goldsmith (who is himself a former member of the Bush administration), the Constitution \u201cwas designed to create a more perfect domestic order, and its foreign relations mechanisms were crafted to enhance U.S. welfare.\u201d", "A competing view, championed mostly by liberals, defines the rule of law differently: law is conceived not as a quintessentially national phenomenon but rather as a global ideal. The liberal position readily concedes that the Constitution specifies the law for the United States but stresses that a fuller, more complete conception of law demands that American law be pictured alongside international law and other (legitimate) national constitutions. The U.S. Constitution, on this cosmopolitan view, faces outward. It is a paradigm of the rule of law: rights similar to those it confers on Americans should protect all people everywhere, so that no one falls outside the reach of some legitimate legal order. What is most important about our Constitution, liberals stress, is not that it provides rights for us but that its vision of freedom ought to apply universally.", "The Supreme Court, whose new term begins Oct. 6, has become a battleground for these two worldviews. In the last term, which ended in June, the justices gave expression to both visions. In two cases in particular \u2014 one high-profile, the other largely overlooked \u2014 the justices divided into roughly two blocs, representing the \u201cinward\u201d and \u201coutward\u201d looking conceptions of the Constitution, with Justice Anthony Kennedy voting with liberals in one case and conservatives in the other. The Supreme Court is on the verge of several retirements; how the justices will address critical issues of American foreign policy in the future hangs very much in the balance.", "This may seem like an odd way of thinking about international affairs. In the coming presidential election, every voter understands that there is a choice to be made between the foreign-policy visions of John McCain and Barack Obama. What is less obvious, but no less important, is that Supreme Court appointments have become a de facto part of American foreign policy. The court, like the State Department and the Pentagon, now makes decisions in cases that directly change and shape our relationship with the world. And as the justices decide these cases, they are doing as much as anyone to shape America\u2019s fortunes in an age of global terror and economic turmoil.", "What Conservatives Understand About International Law", "The debate between inward-looking conservatives and outward-looking liberals has recently taken a turn toward the shrill. Liberal lawyers do not simply accuse their conservative counterparts of denigrating the rule of law; they accuse them of violating it themselves. Calling last spring for the firing of the tenured Berkeley professor John Yoo, an architect of the Bush administration\u2019s legal strategy in the war on terror, Marjorie Cohn, the president of the National Lawyers\u2019 Guild, declared that \u201cYoo\u2019s complicity in establishing the policy that led to the torture of prisoners constitutes a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act.\u201d", "The conservatives\u2019 arguments are no less heated: not only, they contend, do liberals paint a na\u00efvely romantic picture of the world \u2014 one in which the United Nations and its agencies and courts would make law for Americans \u2014 but liberals are also endangering American lives. Dissenting this past June from the Supreme Court decision giving those held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay a right to challenge their detention, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the majority\u2019s ruling \u201cwill almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.\u201d", "These sorts of accusations are overstated and unhelpful. Neither the liberal nor the conservative view corresponds to the stereotype assigned to it by its opponents. Notwithstanding their limitations, both views express values that are deeply grounded in the American constitutional tradition and in the rule of law. Each is necessary to help us make sense of the Constitution\u2019s role in an increasingly complex global world.", "Consider first the conservative vision, which is sometimes called \u201csovereigntist\u201d because it emphasizes the power and prerogative of the United States to act as if it is responsible to no one but itself. The Bush administration, through its characteristic combination of boldness, historical ambition and operational incompetence, has given sovereignty a bad name, much as it has for unilateralism. But the constitutional principle here is actually one that most liberals also fully embrace: namely, the principle of democracy.", "International law, as even its staunchest defenders must acknowledge, often fails to accord with democratic principle. Such law is not passed by a democratically elected Congress and signed by a democratically elected president. It is true that the U.S. Constitution says that international treaties signed by the president and approved by the Senate shall be the supreme law of the land, thereby conferring some democratic legitimacy on treaties. But a great deal of international law derives not from treaties signed by consenting nations but rather from the vague category of international custom, which over time can harden into binding law. For hundreds of years, until more formal treaties were adopted, custom was the main way international law was created, giving rise to the laws of war, for instance, and condemning terrorism and torture. Even today, the existence of a treaty among only a select group of nations can be invoked in international forums as evidence of an established custom \u2014 and nonparticipating countries can come to be bound by treaties that they themselves never signed.", "To conservatives, such international \u201claw\u201d is anathema. Even in cases in which explicit treaties among nations do exist, conservatives worry. Such treaties, after all, are increasingly interpreted by nondemocratic institutions like tribunals of the World Trade Organization or the United Nations\u2019 International Court of Justice. Two hundred years ago, treaties tended to be simple agreements between two parties, with each reserving the right to interpret (and, if necessary, enforce) the treaty\u2019s terms for itself. Today, though, many of the most important treaties \u2014 those governing trade, the environment and other crucial matters \u2014 involve a large number of nations that agree as a condition of the treaty to be bound by the decisions of an international body. To sign on to such a treaty, conservatives point out, confers future lawmaking authority on some unelected and thus undemocratic body.", "According to the sovereigntists, the United States, faced with such undemocratic regimes, should feel free to reject any undesirable verdict of a body like the International Court of Justice and embrace a policy more in line with U.S. interests \u2014 much in the way that Israel responded to the I.C.J.\u2019s condemnation of the path of its security barrier on the West Bank. In a world where Libya can lead an international human rights commission, no international institution is free from the distortions that arise when all countries are treated as equals. Even within the distinguished higher echelons of the United Nations or European Union, there is a risk that bureaucrats may pursue policies that reflect the values and priorities of their own technocratic classes. The worst-case scenario, from the perspective of the conservatives, is one in which enemies of the United States engage in \u201clawfare,\u201d opportunistically charging the country with violations of international law to impede it from rightfully ensuring its safety.", "Another key sovereigntist principle is the right of the United States, when acting abroad, to protect itself, whether fighting wars or preventing terrorist attacks. Historically, the court has given the president, as commander in chief, great latitude to act abroad as he sees fit. In situations in which Congress has explicitly authorized the president\u2019s action, the court has recognized the prerogative as almost absolute. For instance, when the United States acquired Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines in the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court allowed Congress and the president to govern those territories without extending constitutional rights to the residents. Similarly, after World War II, when Germans held by the United States in occupied Germany pending war-crimes charges petitioned for judicial review, the Supreme Court turned them away.", "Conservatives argue, not implausibly, that these historic decisions did not undermine the rule of law: they embodied it. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgments derived, after all, from the Constitution itself and its own democratic pedigree. One central reason that the people of the United States formed the Constitution was in order to provide for the common defense. The Constitution does protect rights, according to this view \u2014 but they are the rights of citizens, not the rights of mankind in general or of foreigners who have never even set foot in the United States.", "What Liberals Understand About International Law", "From the liberal perspective, the vision espoused by the conservatives is crabbed and parochial. Of course the Constitution demands democracy and gives rights to American citizens. But, say the progressives, that does not explain why over the last two centuries the Constitution has become the very model of what a system of government under law looks like. The key to the Constitution\u2019s global appeal, according to the liberal view, is that the document stands for the universal principle that state power over individuals may only ever be exercised through law \u2014 no matter what government is acting, and no matter where on earth.", "This outward-looking, \u201cinternationalist\u201d conception of the Constitution respects the sovereignty of the United States and that of other countries \u2014 provided they deliver a just legal order to their citizens. But liberals point out that even a constitutional state that guarantees rights for its own citizens will not protect people in many places and times, often when rights are most sorely needed. In wartime, for instance, almost no nation will have an interest in protecting the rights of foreign enemies that it encounters. On the open seas, no domestic law applies. And for reasons of sheer practicality, no country\u2019s laws regulate all its potential relations with all other states. To cover situations like these, where domestic law runs out of rope, is the task of international law. Such law seeks to ensure rights for all, not by replacing the domestic law of independent nations but by holding it to standards of universal justice and by supplementing it where it is incomplete or inadequate.", "From this perspective, international law is necessary to ensure that the rule of law will actually obtain in situations where individual states do not provide it. This is why, for liberals, it is essential that the United States comply with its international obligations. The framers of the Constitution were certainly eager to demonstrate such compliance. When they made treaties the law of the land, they were saying \u2014 according to an interpretation of Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s that dates back to 1829 \u2014 that the moment the Senate ratifies a treaty, it automatically becomes the supreme law of the land, binding in every court in the nation.", "Deepening their historical argument, the liberals also point out that from the earliest days of the United States, the nation\u2019s courts applied customary international law, regularly deciding who owned ships captured on the high seas according to immemorial practice that was not found in any treaty. What is more, the framers\u2019 reliance on international law and custom went to the very heart of their constitutional endeavor: what, otherwise, did the framers mean when they spoke in the Constitution about the declaration of war, or about letters of marque and reprisal, or about judicial authority over ambassadors?", "In practice, the internationalist camp argues for the prudent use of international legal materials in constitutional decision-making \u2014 not only for purposes of rhetoric and persuasion but also to provide rules and principles to help actually decide cases. For example, liberals argue that if the United States adopts laws designed to comply with the Geneva Conventions, the government is obligated to follow the treaty to the letter should the government invoke the authority to detain prisoners that the treaty confers. Likewise, when the United States has undertaken to comply with the decisions of international tribunals, those tribunals\u2019 rulings must be treated as law, just as the treaties themselves are.", "Liberals concede that the framers showed respect for international law, in part, because their country was new and revolutionary, and they sought legitimacy in the community of nations. But the liberal view stresses that the tradition of respect continued even once the nation was well established, and that it was kept alive by successive generations for different but always compelling reasons. The United States helped found the United Nations after World War II, for instance, at what was then the nation\u2019s moment of greatest global power. Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s idea, shared by liberals then and now, was that the international rule of law was good not just in principle but also in practice. As a country governed by law, we were asserting the superiority of our system to others governed by dictatorship. Moreover, since the United States was a permanent member of the Security Council, any compromises to our national sovereignty were more than outweighed by the tremendous benefits of having a legitimate international legal order through which, as a superpower, it could assert its will.", "As liberals see it, being a leading exponent of the rule of law internationally strengthens America\u2019s ability to pressure or bully other countries to respect the rights of their own citizens. In this way, oddly enough, the liberal view is consonant with certain aspirations of the Bush administration. In Afghanistan, Iraq and beyond, President Bush has tried to export liberal constitutionalism, including both elections and basic rights. His \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d is, in fact, a direct descendant of liberal internationalism, a policy associated with Woodrow Wilson and his plans to make the world safe for democracy through the work of international institutions.", "The Bush administration, of course, distrusts international organizations that continue in the tradition of the League of Nations, which Wilson helped to found (though he could not persuade his own country to join it). But Bush\u2019s notion that America\u2019s democratic Constitution should be an inspiration for the world is identifiably Wilsonian \u2014 as is the zeal to spread the good word, voluntarily when possible but by force if necessary. If the greatest tragedy of the Bush presidency is the enormous human cost of America\u2019s ham-handed efforts to accomplish this worthy goal, a second, related tragedy is that the spreading of constitutional democracy is rarely talked about anymore as a liberal goal at all.", "The Court\u2019s Liberal Victory", "Each constitutional worldview \u2014 the one conservative and inward-looking, the other liberal and outward-focused \u2014 has found exponents on the current Supreme Court. This past spring, in two cases before the court, each side won an important victory. The larger battle, however, was widely overlooked. The liberal victory was widely publicized, but its full implications were not often noted. As for the conservative win, its very existence went almost entirely unnoticed.", "The liberal victory, in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, took place against the backdrop of the detentions of suspected terrorists at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. The detainees were being held there because the Bush administration\u2019s lawyers were confident that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent, the detainees would not enjoy constitutional rights. Like the Germans denied review after World War II, the detainees were noncitizens who were neither arrested nor held in the United States. Guant\u00e1namo was leased from Cuba under a 1903 treaty, so it was not in the United States, and yet there was no tradition of applying Cuban law there.", "In light of these circumstances, the Bush administration seemed to believe it could treat Guant\u00e1namo as a law-free zone. Unlike Iraq, which the administration conceded was a war zone in which the Geneva Conventions applied, Guant\u00e1namo was initially considered legally off the grid. It is often said by liberal critics that Bush\u2019s anti-terror policies ignored the Constitution and international law. But this is a misleading oversimplification. What the choice of Guant\u00e1namo demonstrates, rather, is the profoundly legalistic way in which those policies were designed. Using the law itself, the lawyers in the Bush administration set out to make Guant\u00e1namo into a legal vacuum.", "The court\u2019s decision in Boumediene repudiated that attempt. The majority, led by Justice Kennedy, announced that for constitutional purposes, Guant\u00e1namo Bay was part of the United States: the detainees there enjoyed the same rights as if they had been held in Washington. The Boumediene decision was chiefly the accomplishment of Justice John Paul Stevens, who has made overturning the Bush detention policies into the legacy-defining task of his distinguished career. In key opinions issued in 2004 and 2006, Stevens chipped away at the special status asserted for Guant\u00e1namo, each time referring the matter of judicial review for the detainees back to Congress. But Congress repeatedly approved the administration\u2019s proposals to deny access to the courts. To win the fight even against Congress, Stevens needed Kennedy to provide the fifth vote and hold that denying the Guant\u00e1namo detainees their day in court actually violated the Constitution.", "The opinion that Kennedy wrote for the court\u2019s majority in Boumediene announced squarely that the Constitution applied to the detainees being held in Guant\u00e1namo. Kennedy insisted that he was not overruling the precedent of the German detainees who were denied review. Unlike the situation with the Germans after World War II, he argued, the Guant\u00e1namo detainees had not received a hearing; the Guant\u00e1namo naval base was entirely under U.S. control; and granting hearings was not so impractical that it would fundamentally disrupt the operation of the prison. In effect, however, Kennedy\u2019s opinion rejected what the Bush administration claimed to be the rule that noncitizens held outside the United States were not entitled to constitutional protection.", "Having refused to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 1990s and having championed gay rights in recent years, Kennedy may now be depicted as an unlikely liberal hero \u2014 the latest in a line of Republican appointees (one of whom is John Paul Stevens) who gradually evolved into staunch exponents of liberal rights. The key to Kennedy\u2019s reasoning in the Guant\u00e1namo case was his expansive conception of the rule of law. In the central paragraph of the decision, Kennedy explained his underlying logic: if Congress and the president had the power to take control of a territory and then determine that U.S. law does not apply there, \u201cit would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint,\u201d he wrote. Government without courts, Kennedy suggested, was not constitutional government at all. \u201cOur basic charter,\u201d he went on, \u201ccannot be contracted away like this.\u201d", "What seemed to most offend Kennedy about Guant\u00e1namo, then, was precisely the effort by the executive branch, with the approval of Congress, to make Guant\u00e1namo into a place beyond the reach of any law. By insisting on its own authority, the court was striking a blow for law itself. In this way, the court embraced the ideal of the outward-looking Constitution: a document that protects the rights not only of citizens within the United States but also of noncitizens outside its formal borders. This Constitution, by extension, stands for the ideal of legal justice being made available to all persons \u2014 no matter where they might be.", "Holding that the Constitution did indeed follow the flag to Guant\u00e1namo was an act with tremendous international resonance. It can even be read as an attempt to hold the Bush administration to its own rhetoric about democracy. The rule of law, after all, is not solely an American ideal but one that is broadly shared globally. To insist that some law covers all people wherever they may be found underscores the universality that law aims to create.", "The Court\u2019s Conservative Victory", "From the conservative point of view, of course, Kennedy\u2019s decision did not follow from the basic principle of the rule of law. According to the four conservative dissenting justices, whose views closely tracked those of the Bush administration, the Constitution unquestionably binds the government. But according to their view, the Constitution also allows the president and Congress, acting together, to lease or even acquire territory and govern it without allowing recourse to the courts. Indeed, this view was precisely the one adopted by the Supreme Court after the Spanish-American War, when the United States was a rising imperial power. The dissenters in Boumediene actually agree with the liberals that law does apply to Guant\u00e1namo; they just maintain that the courts are not part of it.", "The conservative cause may have lost in Boumediene. It prevailed, however, in a case decided last March that garnered little public attention\u2014 but that was, in its own way, just as important to defining our constitutional era. The case, Medell\u00edn v. Texas, grew from a conflict between the Supreme Court and the International Court of Justice over death-row inmates in the United States who were apparently never told they had the right to speak to the embassies of their home countries, a right guaranteed by a treaty called the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The international court declared that the violation tainted the inmates\u2019 convictions and insisted that they have their day in court to try to get them overturned.", "The Supreme Court disagreed. In his initial trial and appeal, Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn, the man who brought the Supreme Court case, did not raise his right to speak to his embassy \u2014 presumably because, having never been informed of the right, he had no idea that it existed. Under the arcane rules for postconviction judicial review, a defendant ordinarily cannot ask the courts to consider legal arguments that were not raised when he was tried in the first place. And in its decision, the court upheld those rules: the violation of the treaty, it held, did not demand any special exception to the usual rules governing review. The fact that the United States had violated its international-treaty obligation was of no use on death row. Medell\u00edn was executed by the State of Texas on Aug. 5.", "What made this conflict between the Supreme Court and the International Court of Justice particularly stark was that the Bush administration had for once taken the side of international law. Before the Supreme Court issued its opinion, President Bush issued a memorandum advising state courts to follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice. With the ruling of the Supreme Court on one side, and that of the international court \u2014 endorsed by the president \u2014 on the other, just what did the Constitution require the state courts to do?", "The United States signed three separate treaties stating that it undertook to obey the judgments of the International Court of Justice. But the Supreme Court bridled at the thought that the international court\u2019s decision might trump its own. This was not just instinctive turf-protection, though that concern no doubt played a part. Never before had an international body replaced the Supreme Court in telling lower courts in the United States that their own procedural rules were unacceptable. The natural order of things seemed to be turned on its head.", "The Supreme Court held that the treaties obligating us to listen to the International Court of Justice were not binding law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that a careful reading of the text of the treaties revealed no intention to subject the United States to the judgments of the international court \u2014 not, that is, unless Congress passed a separate statute demanding such obedience.", "This opinion upended the rules for applying treaties in the U.S. courts. In dissent, Justice Breyer painted a grim picture of the consequences. If treaties were not automatically binding law unless they said so, he wrote, the applicability of some 70 treaties involving economic cooperation, consular relations and navigation was now thrown into doubt. The rest of the world, he intimated, would be left wondering whether the United States intended to obey its treaty obligations or not \u2014 which is not a trivial concern when the world also suspects the United States of ignoring its obligations of humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions. To Breyer, the decision was a reversal of nearly 180 years of precedent and a message to the world that the United States was prepared to play fast and loose with its international commitments.", "When the justices rejected the death-row appeal, they were acting on the basis of familiar conservative concerns. The judges of the International Court of Justice were not appointed according to any constitutional procedure. To let the international body decide matters of law that would be binding for state courts seemed fundamentally undemocratic \u2014 an unjust usurpation of the judicial function. It would be absurd for the Constitution, as the core document of our democracy, to require such a result.", "The old precedent regarding treaties was thus, according to the conservatives, truly obsolete. It made no sense to apply it in a globalized world where treaties are not just straightforward agreements between sovereign states; now, they often create irresponsible international tribunals to adjudicate their meaning. If the judgments of an international court were to be obligatory, a democratically legitimate body should say so explicitly \u2014 either the Senate that approved the treaty promising compliance or the whole Congress in a separate legal enactment.", "By its own lights, the Supreme Court in the Medell\u00edn case was reading the Constitution to guarantee us control over our own destiny. That meant turning away from international law in a systematic and profound sense. The cost to the United States might be real, but the court considered it justified by the preservation of our democratic sovereignty.", "Which Side Is Right?", "The Boumediene decision saw the Constitution as facing outward, expanding and promoting the rule of law throughout the world. The Medell\u00edn decision, by contrast, saw the Constitution as a domestic blueprint designed to preserve and protect the United States from foreign encroachment, even at some cost to the international rule of law.", "Underscoring the tension between the two cases is the fact that nearly all the justices of the Supreme Court voted consistently across both of them. The four conservatives \u2014 Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito \u2014 dissented from the extension of habeas corpus rights to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Boumediene and joined the majority opinion in Medell\u00edn that made it harder for treaties to become law. Meanwhile the court\u2019s liberals \u2014 Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer \u2014 joined the majority in the Guant\u00e1namo case, and all but Stevens dissented in Medell\u00edn. (Though Stevens voted with the majority in that case, he did so seemingly only for tactical reasons; he wrote a separate, concurring opinion that did not embrace the logic of Roberts\u2019s majority opinion.)", "The key vote in both cases was that of Kennedy. In both cases, he acted to uphold the prerogatives of the Supreme Court \u2014 against the president and Congress in the Guant\u00e1namo case, and against the international court in the Medell\u00edn decision. And Kennedy does argue that such judicial supremacy is crucial to the rule of law. But the other justices did not see the cases in those terms. To them, the cases were not primarily about the perennial issue of the division of powers between the different branches of government. To these eight justices, the cases were about what sort of Constitution we have: either outward-facing or inward-looking.", "Who is right? It is tempting to conclude that the Constitution must look inward and outward simultaneously. But embracing contradiction is not the answer, either. Instead what we need to resolve the present difficulty is a subtle shift in perspective.", "There is an important way in which neither of the predominant approaches to the Constitution and the international order can provide a fully satisfactory answer to the problem. Although they differ deeply about what the Constitution teaches, the two sides share a common image of what the Constitution is. Both imagine it to be a blueprint offering a coherent worldview that will allow us to reach the best results most of the time. According to this shared assumption, the way to find the real or the true Constitution is to identify the core values that the document and the precedents stand for, and to use these as principles to interpret the Constitution correctly.", "There is nothing wrong with this picture of constitutional interpretation when it is applied to the vast majority of constitutional decisions, from the right to bear arms to the meaning of equal protection of the laws. Deciding what deep principles emerge from our history can help resolve even problems unimagined by the framers, like those presented by abortion or claims to gay rights. Most of the time, constitutional interpretation proceeds in precisely this way \u2014 and so it should.", "But when we are talking about the basic direction the country needs to face in order to achieve its goals in the modern world, deriving principles from history is often inadequate to dictate outcomes. The national and global situations in which we find ourselves are ever-changing. The ship of state must navigate in waters that correspond to no existing chart. The complexity of the world, coupled with the profound changes in the role the United States plays in it, is a very different thing from, say, our progressive recognition that African-Americans, women, gays and lesbians deserve the same equality and respect as everybody else.", "For this reason, when the world has changed drastically, the Constitution has always had the flexibility to change along with it. The industrial economy, for example, was so much bigger and more complex than the economy of 1787 that the old constitutional order no longer worked. The New Deal ushered in systematic regulation and administrative agencies that had no real place in the three-branch system \u2014 but that we now accept as constitutional today. The original federal system limiting the power of the central government relative to the states also had to be reconfigured when the economy became truly national. The changed nature of the president\u2019s war powers offers yet another pragmatic example of flexibility and change. Modern wars demand rapid decision-making and overwhelming concentrations of force; in the light of these needs, we have largely abandoned the framers\u2019 model for war powers, which gave Congress much more authority than it is able to exercise today.", "On each occasion that the Supreme Court has had to confront such drastically changed circumstances, it has adopted the approach of seeing constitutional government as an ongoing experiment. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that our system of government is an experiment, \u201cas all life is an experiment.\u201d Justice Robert Jackson, confronting the separation of powers \u2014 about which the Constitution is cryptic at best \u2014 admitted frankly that nothing in the document, the case law or the scholars\u2019 writings got him any closer to an answer. Then he tried to come up with his own rules, designed to reflect political reality and the changed nature of the presidency.", "Looking at today\u2019s problem through the lens of our great constitutional experiment, it emerges that there is no single, enduring answer to which way the Constitution should be oriented, inward or outward. The truth is that we have had an inward- and outward-looking Constitution by turns, depending on the needs of the country and of the world. Neither the text of the Constitution, nor the history of its interpretation, nor the deep values embedded in it justify one answer rather than the other. In the face of such ambiguity, the right question is not simply in what direction does our Constitution look, but where do we need the Constitution to look right now?", "Answering this requires the Supreme Court to think in terms not only of principle but also of policy: to weigh national and international interests; and to exercise fine judgment about how our Constitution functions and is perceived at home and abroad. The conservative and liberal approaches to legitimacy and the rule of law need to be supplemented with a healthy dose of real-world pragmatism. In effect, the fact that the Constitution affects our relations with the world requires the justices to have a foreign policy of their own.", "On the surface, it seems as if such inevitably political judgments are not the proper province of the court. If assessments of the state of the world are called for, shouldn\u2019t the court defer to the decisions of the elected president and Congress? Aren\u2019t judgments about the direction of our country the exclusive preserve of the political branches?", "Indeed, the Supreme Court does need to be limited to its proper role. But when it comes to our engagement with the world, that role involves taking a stand, not stepping aside. The reason for this is straightforward: the court is in charge of interpreting the Constitution, and the Constitution plays a major role in shaping our engagement with the rest of the world.

That was about the chaos theory, meaning one series of events leads to another and the effect of changing the course of those events. Actually the term \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d, was a phenomenon proposed in a doctoral thesis written in 1963 by Edward Lorenz. It states that a butterfly, by flapping its wings in one place and time is able to create a major weather event in another place and time, eventually having a far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent events. The butterfly effect suggests that cause and effect are applicable in the universe even if the pattern is indecipherable and the precise cause of our predicaments, rooted far away in time and space, are ultimately unfathomable. More than just an esoteric science, the chaos theory works off the concept that the relation between any two things is rarely linear in nature, that any reaction is usually the result of an accumulation of causative factors small and large, intentional and accidental.

Current methods divide offensive and defensive alliances according to which player is permitted to attack. However, leaders select the content of alliances from a broader menu of commitments. Alliances often specify the purpose of the alliance, which leaders can initiate what kinds of coercive moves, and what punishments will be imposed if demands are not met. Consequently, I divide alliances according to the signatories\u2019 objective in forming the agreement and the terms of the commitment triggering military intervention. Following Schelling, I ascertain whether the alliance contract was written to compel \u2018\u2018an adversary to do something\u2019\u2019 or to deter it \u2018\u2018from starting something\u2019\u2019 (1966, 69). Then I divide commitments according to the behavior that triggers military intervention. Few alliances are unconditional, promising automatic military assistance under any circumstance. Typically, they delineate some action\u2014e.g., attack, aggression, threat of aggression, unprovoked attack, noncompliance with a demand\u2014which activates the alliance obligations. Finally, some alliances incorporate ambiguity or uncertainty about whether alliance members will intervene. Therefore, a separate category of alliances includes those commitments in which the language of the treaty permits alliance members to choose not to intervene even if the antecedent of the commitment condition has been completely fulfilled."], "id": "fc581d8291e97f8f2a3ec0e55d2b7136d8211e295c4c16164b176aeb6b487104", "highlighted_text": " leaders select alliances from a broader menu of commitments .

As a result, the DPRK government fails, and the country breaks into rival factions that initiate a partial civil war. The DPRK military divides into these various factions, and control of the country\u2019s WMD and delivery systems are also split among the factions. Then, the factions start using some WMD in the civil war.2 In previous work, I have analyzed the ROK and U.S. military forces that would be needed to make a unification of Korea work under less-serious collapse circumstances.3 As this unification path continues, South Korea, fearing a spillover of the civil war and Chinese intervention, launches its forces into North Korea and is supported by the United States.4 The United States begins a full force deployment to Korea to support the ROK effort, but the initial effort on the ground depends almost entirely on ROK forces, given the limited peacetime presence of U.S. ground forces in South Korea. South Korea initially makes good progress into the North because North Korea\u2019s DMZ defense has lost a degree of coherence in the civil war. But the ROK (and Chinese) intervention gradually unifies the North Korean factions, allowing them to pose a more stout 2 Although South Korea would likely be cautious in intervening, by waiting very long to do so, it accepts many risks, including a deteriorating situation in the North and potential Chinese intervention. 3 Bennett and Lind, 2011. This paper identifies the minimum military requirements, assuming that the largest faction essentially surrenders authority to South Korea. The analysis was designed to put a lower bound on the forces needed. If the circumstances are less favorable, larger forces would be required. 4 Indeed, fearing the costs of intervention and of trying to absorb North Korea, South Korea might refrain from intervention until Chinese forces enter North Korea. But as argued in Chapter Two, even if South Korea is initially cautious, a Chinese military intervention in North Korea is highly likely to stimulate a ROK military intervention in the North to prevent Chinese domination of all of North Korea. defense supported by the use of WMD against ROK and U.S. (and Chinese) forces. The WMD use starts initially as chemical artillery supporting the DPRK battlefield defense but eventually transitions to broader WMD use, including of nuclear weapons. If China does not intervene initially, it does so soon thereafter, facing declining security across its border with North Korea. China seeks to stabilize its border area and avoid spillover of the DPRK civil war. In addition, China acts to eliminate North Korea\u2019s WMD. As in the War: ROK-U.S. conquest\u2014costly victory, contested peace path, China would likely have an initial objective of advancing to the narrow neck of North Korea (between Anju and Hamhung) to secure most of the DPRK missile bases and other WMD sites in the northern part of North Korea.5 In this path, as well, China could then decide to advance to Pyongyang. Most of the forces of the Chinese Northern Theater Command and perhaps some forces from its Central Theater Command would need to be committed to achieve China\u2019s objectives. Depending on how far the Chinese forces advance, they would likely perform most of the seizing and elimination of North Korea\u2019s WMD. DPRK forces are much more numerous and better prepared along the DMZ than along the Chinese border. Therefore, in this scenario, DPRK forces likely have more effect in slowing ROK forces than Chinese forces as they advance, depending on the cohesion of the DPRK forces along the DMZ. Both sides presumably are trying to reach and control Pyongyang. Because the distance by road from the Chinese border to Pyongyang is very similar to the distance by road from the DMZ to Pyongyang (both are just over 200 km), and because Chinese forces would likely face lighter DPRK military opposition along the way, they have an initial advantage in trying to reach Pyongyang. But the uncertainties of warfare could allow either side to reach the capital first.6 5 On the missile base locations, see Bermudez, 2011. 6 Although the Chinese forces have sufficient combat power and would face far less DPRK opposition, they have not had to perform this kind of ground operation in recent years and thus would predictably suffer some challenges. For example, despite recent exercises to improve logistical support capabilities, Chinese forces likely would face logistical challenges. As a result, there is great uncertainty in the actual rate of Chinese advance and China\u2019s ability to control a broader area beyond the roads along which it would focus its penetrations. There is a significant risk that, as ROK and Chinese forces approach each other, conflict between South Korea and China could develop. After all, as noted in Chapter Two, South Korea could well treat a Chinese intervention in the North as an invasion of Korea.7 And even if South Korea decided not to try to expel the Chinese forces, accidents could develop between the two forces and escalate to greater conflict. A major war between South Korea and China would be a losing proposition for South Korea and thus ought to be avoided. Depending on the level of North Korea\u2019s escalation to WMD use, the ROK forces aided by U.S. forces might be able to stabilize the area of North Korea south of Pyongyang, which is more rural and less heavily populated. But ROK forces moving into the Pyongyang and Wonsan region, if they do, would find stabilization to be a much more daunting task: The ROK forces in these areas could face a serious DPRK insurgency. As noted in Chapter Three, a ROK government plan to replace much of the DPRK government8 would likely make the local governments in North Korea relatively ineffective for several years, having lost needed familiarity and expertise. What is known of the ROK government\u2019s current plans suggests that many North Korean elites would be quickly alienated, increasing the severity of the insurgency that South Korea would likely face\u2014and thus increasing the difficulty of stabilizing the unification. The bottom line of the DPRK collapse: Intervention path is that it leads to only a partial initial unification of Korea, given a Chinese intervention. The Chinese government likely would not plan to occupy and own parts of the North going forward, so the ROK government needs to plan for negotiations with the Chinese government to secure the withdrawal of its forces. After South Korea is able to achieve a partial unification in this path, it would then face serious questions about sustaining the unification. 7 Article 3 of the ROK constitution says, \u201cThe territory of the Republic of Korea shall consist of the Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands.\u201d Thus, any Chinese intervention into North Korea would be perceived by many in South Korea as an invasion of South Korea. See Republic of Korea, 1987, Article 3. 8 See Gale and Jun, 2014. In particular, a ROK occupation of Pyongyang, likely a major ROK goal, would force South Korea into dealing with a potentially serious insurgency, especially if South Korea expels North Korean elites from their positions of authority, leaving them without jobs. A particular threat would be the DPRK security forces and related military forces that are heavily based in Pyongyang and would likely be opposed to a ROK occupation that would treat many of them as criminals. South Korea might have difficulty suppressing the resulting insurgency. South Korea would likely do better stabilizing the North if it plans for good treatment of North Korea\u2019s elites and has carried out significant psychological operations well ahead of the regime\u2019s collapse to reassure the elites of a good future under a ROK-led unification. Waiting to take such action after regime collapse would likely be too late to gain that trust; the North Koreans would have difficulty believing the sincerity of ROK changes in policy and could seek to disrupt the unification.", ""], "id": "84ee28fcce15cf9ace880842f9513b404ef24e484cba64646c54c2035da34260", "highlighted_text": " Kim Jong-un dies and there is no Kim family successor the government fails the country breaks into factions a partial civil war.

Moreover, North Korea is unlikely to attack South Korea- despite such incidents as the November 23, 2010, shelling of Yeongpyeong Island near the disputed maritime border-since a Northern military offensive against the South would inexorably result in a larger scale war involving the U.S. and China, spelling the end of North Korea as it is known today.", "As for the second prediction, if the U.S. sees North Korea as either collapsing or giving up its nuclear weapons through a hard-line policy of economic strangulation, the odds of success are remote, for North Korea depends heavily on Chinese aid and trade in consumer goods, food, and oil. Ironically, a strangulation policy also increases the likelihood of North Korea producing and selling more nuclear weapons internationally to replenish its economy.

As a result, North Korea is dependent on China as its greatest economic benefactor-negotiating economic aid, inward investment, foreign trade, and political support-especially with the Six-Party Talks at a standstill since 2009 and with U.S. and UN economic sanctions in effect. Basically, Chinese aid and support are the economic component, among the cultural-historical and political-ideological factors, preventing a sudden collapse of North Korea, and China will never allow the U.S. to unite the Korean peninsula on American terms. As Chinese objectives toward North Korea protect Chinese interests, international efforts to foment a North Korean crisis or foreign regime change will always face Chinese resistance. And should circumstances run out of control, China will intervene to restore stability and political order.21", "In view of the hard facts, the U.S. and its allies should acknowledge that North Korea will not collapse soon, nor will it surrender its nuclear weapons. Likewise, North Korea, should acknowledge that the U.S. and its allies will not give economic aid and security assurances until the country abandons its nuclear program. Contradictory as the situation may be, a mechanism is needed to convince the U.S. and North Korea to admit that each party will not accept the other's hard-line demands.

The pollock industry agrees with the federal scientists. \"This (population decline) was not unexpected, and the sky is not falling,\" said David Benton, executive director of the Marine Conservation Alliance, which represents western Alaska fishing fleets, processors and ports. Federal scientists have called for a dramatic reduction in the pollock industry's harvest next year -- the lowest catch in the fishery's history -- in response to the decline. Greenpeace and other conservation groups say even deeper cuts in the catch are needed to ensure that pollock remain healthy in the long run. The federal scientists have recommended limiting the pollock harvest to 815,000 tons -- the smallest in more than 30 years. Greenpeace is pushing for a much smaller harvest: 458,000 tons. \"Pollock is one of the most important food sources for every animal in the Bering Sea food web,\" said George Pletnikoff, a Greenpeace campaigner based in Alaska.  Next week, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet in Anchorage to consider next year's catch limit, among other tasks. The meetings begin Monday and are expected to spill over into the following week. \"People can go to the Anchorage Hilton hotel next week and give their opinions and thoughts about the fishery. They should be involved in it,\" Pletnikoff said. National Marine Fisheries Service scientists say the decline in Bering Sea pollock is due to natural variability in the fish population that has been documented for decades, not too much harvesting.

International conflict over environmental factors remain unlikely \u2013 whether due to the robust nature of the world trade system and dynamics of supply and demand or to the spread of small arms transforming the notion of traditional conflict (Deudney, 1990).

Whenever there have been nuclear tests by North Korea, some segments of the South Korean public demanded that South Korea should develop its own nuclear weapons or bring back tactical nuclear weapons from the United States. About two out of three South Koreans seemed to support nuclear weapons for their country in a September 2017 public poll right after North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test (Lee 2017b). Politicians and pundits also have argued that South Korea should be allowed to reprocess spent fuel for plutonium, as Japan does. This would put South Korea in a position to produce nuclear weapons more quickly (Kang 2016). According to Hwang Il-soon, a professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University (SNU), South Korea needs to have a reprocessing plant to produce weaponizable plutonium, with which it would need just one year to produce enough weapons-grade plutonium to fuel roughly 20 warheads (Oswald 2018). Yim Man-sung, another well-known nuclear engineer at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), estimates the country needs two years for technical development of a nuclear weapon, setting aside all political difficulties (Oswald 2018). Suh Kune-yul, a professor of nuclear engineering at SNU, said that \u201cif we (South Korea) decide to stand on our own feet and put our resources together, we can build nuclear weapons in six months. The question is whether the president has the political will\u201d (Sanger, Choe, and Rich 2017). In 2015, Charles Ferguson, then president of the Federation of American Scientists, said that South Korea had up to 4330 bombs\u2019 worth of plutonium at the Wolsong site, assuming a conservative estimate of about 6 kg plutonium for a first-generation fission device. The CANDU (CANadian Deuterium Uranium) spent fuel stored at Wolsong at the time contained about 26,000 kg of plutonium (Ferguson 2015).", ""], "id": "535074999d565562f0e9bfc7379a9c4a7d28e275c46c581edb1deeb09c64dfe8", "highlighted_text": " Voices for nuclear armament have been rising in South Korea two out of three support nuclear weapons South Korea reprocess spent fuel for plutonium This would put South Korea position produce nuclear weapons quickly if South Korea put resources together build nuclear weapons in six months The question is political will South Korea had 4330 bombs\u2019 worth of plutonium 26,000 kg of plutonium", "highlights": [[3, 0, 27], [3, 28, 37], [3, 38, 44], [3, 45, 59], [3, 317, 333], [3, 358, 381], [3, 536, 547], [3, 569, 578], [3, 579, 603], [3, 620, 646], [3, 652, 660], [3, 664, 687], [3, 693, 700], [3, 1354, 1356], [3, 1361, 1372], [3, 1410, 1413], [3, 1418, 1436], [3, 1445, 1450], [3, 1451, 1469], [3, 1470, 1480], [3, 1482, 1485], [3, 1486, 1497], [3, 1528, 1542], [3, 1669, 1680], [3, 1681, 1684], [3, 1691, 1721], [3, 1935, 1944], [3, 1945, 1957]], "underlines": [[3, 0, 27], [3, 27, 27], [3, 28, 37], [3, 38, 44], [3, 45, 59], [3, 60, 85], [3, 311, 316], [3, 317, 333], [3, 334, 357], [3, 358, 381], [3, 536, 547], [3, 548, 568], [3, 569, 578], [3, 578, 578], [3, 579, 603], [3, 620, 646], [3, 647, 651], [3, 652, 660], [3, 661, 663], [3, 664, 687], [3, 688, 692], [3, 693, 700], [3, 1354, 1356], [3, 1357, 1361], [3, 1361, 1372], [3, 1372, 1409], [3, 1410, 1413], [3, 1414, 1417], [3, 1418, 1436], [3, 1436, 1444], [3, 1445, 1450], [3, 1450, 1450], [3, 1451, 1469], [3, 1470, 1480], [3, 1482, 1485], [3, 1485, 1485], [3, 1486, 1497], [3, 1498, 1527], [3, 1528, 1542], [3, 1657, 1668], [3, 1669, 1680], [3, 1680, 1680], [3, 1681, 1684], [3, 1685, 1690], [3, 1691, 1721], [3, 1722, 1728], [3, 1729, 1736], [3, 1737, 1741], [3, 1839, 1850], [3, 1850, 1858], [3, 1859, 1898], [3, 1899, 1906], [3, 1907, 1934], [3, 1935, 1944], [3, 1945, 1957]], "emphasis": [[3, 38, 44], [3, 317, 333], [3, 664, 687], [3, 693, 700], [3, 1470, 1480], [3, 1691, 1721], [3, 1935, 1944]], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "neg-3.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2006-01-01"}, {"tag": "A2: No Cred theory", "cite": "Gerzhoy 15 [Gene Gerzhoy is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the John F.

Additionally, the country is an especially easy case for the logic of nuclear dependence, as the U.S. imperative to contain Soviet expansion should have led West Germany to perceive U.S. security guarantees as highly credible. By contrast, although Germany\u2019s acute dependence arguably makes this an easy case for the logic of alliance coercion, existing theories of alliance politics suggest that Washington\u2019s unique interest in West Germany\u2019s defense should have undermined the credibility of U.S. threats of abandonment, making the case a hard one for my argument.6 Finally, because U.S. alliance policy toward Germany varied over time, scholars can employ within-case variation to test the distinct predictions of the two competing logics of security guarantees.", "By examining West German nuclear history, this article helps to correct the mistaken belief\u2014still common among political scientists studying nuclear proliferation\u2014that German nuclear ambitions were fleeting or nonexistent. For example, two widely cited quantitative analyses of nuclear proliferation code West Germany as having never pursued nuclear weapons.7 More recent research contends that the country only explored the weapons option from 1957 to 1958.8 With notable exceptions, political scientists have concluded that there was never \u201cany serious rethinking of the German acquiescence to renunciation [End Page 93] of a truly independent, national nuclear capability.\u201d9 As I argue below, these assertions overlook evidence that Germany sought to acquire an independent nuclear deterrent from 1956 to 1963, and that it fought to retain its weapons option from 1964 to 1969.10 Rather than voluntarily forswearing acquisition of a nuclear capability, the FRG was compelled to do so by explicit U.S. threats of military abandonment. By failing to incorporate evidence of West German nuclear ambitions and U.S. abandonment threats into past analyses of nuclear decisionmaking, nonproliferation scholars have not only misunderstood a critical case of nuclear reversal, but have also overstated the explanatory power of the logic of nuclear dependence.", "By describing and testing the logic of alliance coercion, this article advances the study of nuclear proliferation and improves upon existing theories of alliance politics. Most important, my argument contributes to a growing literature that highlights the centrality of U.S. nonproliferation policy for containing the spread of nuclear weapons.11 Nonproliferation scholars had previously accepted Kenneth Waltz\u2019s assertion that \u201cin the past half-century, no country has been able to prevent other countries from going nuclear if they were determined to do so.\u201d12 By identifying the conditions when security guarantees serve as the basis for coercive leverage, this article tempers Waltz\u2019s skepticism and demarcates the contours of U.S. influence. In addition, it challenges the argument that nuclear decisions can be understood only by examining domestic political variables.13 Instead, by demonstrating how interactions between a client [End Page 94] and its patron shape the client\u2019s incentives for nuclear acquisition or restraint, it returns the focus to external security imperatives for explaining nuclear choices. Finally, by developing the logic of alliance coercion and demonstrating how it shaped the nuclear trajectory of a critical U.S. client, this article provides an important amendment to standard theories of alliance politics, which argue that threats of abandonment will not be credible against strategically valuable allies.14"], "id":

Since the end of the Second World War, despite pursing peaceful civilian uses of nuclear energy, both the Japanese government and its general population have been opposed to the weaponization of nuclear technology. However, much has changed since the late 1940s, and as regional geopolitics change, so too may Japan's stance. Despite many diplomatic missions to the region, including a recent visit by Japan's prime minister, Southeast Asia continues to be an issue for Japan. Animosity and tensions still exist from the conquests by Imperial Japan during the Second World War, and in addition, many nations in the region depend heavily on the Chinese investment, crowding out Japan's own. As the situation develops, it is not impossible for Japan to develop nuclear weapons as a way of contesting China's increasing economic and military influence. In fact, China has already begun to clash with Japan: the territorial dispute over Senkaku/Diaoyu Island continues to be extremely dangerous to Sino-Japanese relations many believe that the risk of armed conflict between the two nations is the highest since the Second World War. In addition, North Korea continues to test nuclear weapons and missile launch capabilities, causing much unease in the Japanese government. At the end of the Second World War, many factors contributed to Japan's anti-nuclear weapon stance. While the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki played a major role in its definition, the promise of US protection solidified this position. Both the Mutual Security Assistance Pact of 1952 and the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security essentially guarantee that Japan is protected by the United States' military might, including its massive nuclear arsenal. Even so, in the past, regional events have triggered a move toward Japanese nuclear weaponization. In the 1960s, China's first nuclear weapons test led the Japanese Prime Minister to investigate the possibility of weaponization. In 1995, another investigation occurred as a result of the 1994 North Korean Nuclear Crisis, when North Korea threatened war in response to possible sanctions. Conducted by the Japanese Defense Agency, the secret investigation decided that developing nuclear weapons would harm USJapan relations. Notably, all of these investigations and reports proceeded in spite of a 1955 law that specifically prohibits Japan from researching and developing nuclear weapons. Japan has been at the forefront of developing next generation nuclear technology. Despite the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, in which a nuclear meltdown resulted in the release of large amounts of radioactive material, the newly elected Japanese government continues to support the construction of nuclear power plants. Japan also owns 42.7 metric tons of plutonium, which, according to the Congressional Research Service, has the potential to create over 1,000 nuclear weapons, a stockpile that is predicted to increase to over 1 10 metric tons by 2020. Japan's ability to create a nuclear weapon is, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \"a screwdriver's turn away.\" In combination with missile technologies developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan could develop its own nuclear deterrent should it decide that the United States's is inadequate or unnecessary. Japan's reliance on US military support may also be changing. Experts predicted that the warming of relations between Washington and Beijing would distance Tokyo. The Cold War is over, and the strategic need to have an extended US presence in Japan has lessened. There have been movements in both the United States and Japan for the United States to reduce its presence in the Japanese Islands. Younger Japanese are increasingly nationalistic and favor weaponization in greater numbers, but whether Japan will risk relations with the United States remains to be seen. Here, the US policy toward other East Asian allies has a large impact on Japan, which might see the lack of support for Taiwanese independence as an abandonment. The only significant barrier preventing Japan from developing nuclear weapons is the security it obtains from relying on the United States. Japan values the economic and security benefits the relationship has brought, causing reluctance among the Japanese government to perform any actions that would damage this relationship. However, if the government, for whatever reason, is able to overcome this reluctance, Japan could quickly and easily acquire a nuclear deterrent. The prospect of Japan becoming a nuclear power is disturbing; it is currently one of the most outspoken advocates against nuclear weapons and this action would severely undermine the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

May 8th, 2018. DOA: 8/28/19. Pages 5-10. ]", "body": ["A later generation of scholars, however, departed from Schelling\u2019s analysis. Few scholars question the importance of credibility per se, if credibility is defined as the perception that the United States will act to defend its key interests. What they have critiqued, rather, is the idea that establishing credibility requires regular demonstrations of American resolve, particularly through the use of force. Some scholars have noted, for instance, that concerns with resolve and credibility led the United States to undertake policies\u2014such as escalation in Vietnam\u2014that incurred losses far out of proportion to the reputational gains.16 Others claimed to find little evidence that past demonstrations of resolve actually mattered in affecting opponents\u2019 calculations of credibility. In one widely read study, Daryl Press contended that Western appeasement of Hitler at Munich had little or nothing to do with his subsequent aggression, and that Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s repeated climb-downs on Berlin and other issues in the late 1950s had scant impact on Western perceptions of his resolve.17 Press and other scholars argued that other variables\u2014the balance of capabilities and the perceived importance of the interests at stake\u2014were paramount in determining perceptions of credibility.18 Other scholars have made similar arguments, claiming that \u201cpoliticians\u2019 persistent belief in the value of reputation for resolve is merely a cult of reputation,\u201d or even, in an extreme form, that \u201ccredibility is an illusion\u2014and an exceptionally dangerous illusion at that.\u201d19", "Such doubts may be most prevalent within the ivory tower, and relatively few policymakers would share academics\u2019 skepticism about the importance of credibility and demonstrations of resolve.20 Yet it is worth nothing that a similar skepticism has emerged in some surprising quarters of the policymaking community of late. As Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in 2016, then-President Obama believed that the U.S. foreign policy community \u201cmakes a fetish of \u2018credibility\u2019\u2014particularly the sort of credibility purchased with force.\u201d As the president acidly remarked, \u201cDropping bombs on someone to prove that you\u2019re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.\u201d21 It would require an extended essay to adjudicate these debates regarding credibility and its constituent parts. Yet three key points can briefly be made here. First, and most important, the more extreme critiques of credibility and U.S. policymakers\u2019 preoccupation therewith are badly overstated. For one thing, accepting that credibility is an illusion, or that past behavior has no impact on perceptions of an actor\u2019s subsequent credibility, requires accepting that normal rules of human interaction\u2014in which past behavior is crucial to expectations about future behavior\u2014are simply suspended in the international arena. If a person reneges on a commitment, his peers and interlocutors will likely doubt his sincerity with respect to other commitments; there is no logical reason to suspect that similar patterns do not prevail in international politics. For another thing, deeming credibility an illusion requires accepting that virtually all U.S. officials who think otherwise\u2014in part because they know, from experience, that U.S. allies as well as adversaries are constantly assessing recent American behavior in hopes of divining what Washington will do in the next crisis\u2014are simply mistaken. Not least, there is now considerable historical analysis and evidence illustrating that credibility does matter and past actions do indeed affect reputations. Scholars have convincingly argued that: ", "\u2022Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision not to retaliate meaningfully for Hezbollah\u2019s attacks on the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 had a corrosive effect on how other terrorists and state sponsors perceived U.S. intentions. When U.S. officials threatened Syrian president Hafez al-Assad with retribution if he did not cease supporting Hezbollah, for instance, Assad replied that he did not credit American threats.22", "\u2022Conversely, the U.S. willingness to defend South Korea in 1950 influenced Soviet perceptions of American resolve to resist further East bloc military advances. As William Stueck writes in his definitive history of the Korean War, \u201cStalin\u2019s immediate successors learned the lesson that to arouse the United States from a slumber through blatant military action could prove a costly mistake. It would take more than a generation and a new group of leaders before the Soviet Union would run a repeat performance.\u201d23", "\u2022The U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam did encourage additional East bloc challenges in the Third World\u2014in Angola, for instance\u2014by signaling a declining U.S. willingness to act decisively to head off Soviet and Cuban advances in peripheral areas.24", "\u2022John F. Kennedy\u2019s perceived irresolution in handling the Bay of Pigs invasion encouraged Khrushchev to bully him at the Vienna Summit in 1961. His actions there and in response to the construction of the Berlin Wall also influenced the Soviet decision to place missiles in Cuba a year later.25", "\u2022Early U.S. irresolution and failure to make good on coercive threats in dealing with the Balkan crisis in the early 1990s led actors in that crisis to doubt subsequent U.S. promises and threats. Later shows of resolve, by contrast, had a constructive impact on the subsequent behavior of those actors. \u201cWhenever US officials failed to respond to probes and challenges, violence escalated. When resolve was demonstrated through mobilizing military forces or airstrikes, escalation was controlled.\u201d26", "\u2022Tepid U.S. responses to al-Qaeda attacks during the 1990s, along with the U.S. withdrawal from Somalia following the deaths of less than 20 American servicemen in 1993, encouraged Osama bin Laden to escalate his strikes in the belief that the United States would react to a shocking attack on the homeland by withdrawing from the greater Middle East.27", "Moreover, and notwithstanding the academic skepticism discussed above, there has also emerged a growing body of social science literature in recent years indicating that the extreme critiques of credibility are unpersuasive, because past actions and demonstrations of resolve do influence subsequent expectations. Studies have shown that: ", "\u2022\u201cStates that have honored their commitments in the past are more likely to find alliance partners in the future. Conversely, alliance violations decrease the likelihood of future alliance formation.\u201d28", "\u2022Backing down in a dispute with a given challenger increases the likelihood that the challenger \u201cwill escalate the current dispute,\u201d whereas an effective response that forces the challenger to back down decreases the likelihood that the challenger will subsequently escalate. In other words, retreating now encourages more severe challenges later; resisting now can have the opposite effect.29", "\u2022\u201cA defender that enjoys superiority in military resources but does not use force in some manner in a current conflict is at a higher risk of experiencing a re-challenge than is a defender that enjoys military superiority and uses it in some.\u201d In essence, demonstrations of resolve through the use of force are important in shaping the future behavior of adversaries.30", "\u2022\u201cBehavior in earlier conflicts . . . becomes the basis for inferring likely behavior in response to subsequent challenges. . . . A country that yielded in a dispute in the previous year is more than two and one-half times as likely to be challenged than is a country that has not yielded in the previous ten years.\u201d31", "In short, there is good reason to think that credibility and resolve are more than mere figments of policymakers\u2019 imaginations.  A second point, however, is that there are nonetheless limits to our understanding of how credibility works. There remain unresolved debates about whether credibility attaches to leaders or countries, whether it functions more strongly within a given relationship than across the breadth of a country\u2019s relationships, how long a reputation for resolve or lack thereof lasts, and other issues.32 This is not surprising. Credibility is, after all, a state of mind. That means it is fairly difficult to observe, let alone measure, particularly because doing so often requires getting inside the head of foreign leaders who may have incentives to publicly misrepresent their true estimation of U.S. credibility. Accordingly, credibility is a subject to which there will likely always be attached some degree of uncertainty and ambiguity.  ", "This leads to a third point, which is that concerns with credibility\u2014and particularly with the role that demonstrations of resolve play in generating credibility\u2014need to be kept in perspective. When the United States withdrew from Vietnam, it may have encouraged Moscow to push for advantage in peripheral areas such as Angola, but it evidently did not lead the Kremlin to doubt American willingness to fight for areas of greater importance, such as Western Europe.33 The reason for this is not that credibility and reputation are unimportant; it is simply that past performance and perceptions of resolve are but one factor that determines the credibility of a commitment. Other issues\u2014such as the strength of the interest at stake and the balance of capabilities\u2014also play a vital role. In addition, there are limits to how far a country should go to establish a reputation for credibility and resolve. There was undoubtedly some reputational value in proving that the United States would absorb enormous costs to defend South Vietnam, for instance, but there was not so much value as to outweigh the massive costs in lives and treasure. Credibility is worth cultivating and defending, but not at any price. ", "All of this is to say that credibility is a crucially important\u2014if perhaps not all-important\u2014factor in U.S. foreign policy. Unfortunately, America currently confronts a growing credibility gap in international affairs.

Livy called poisonings of enemies \"secret crimes.\" Cicero referred to poisoning as \"an atrocity.\" But why do poisons evoke such dread? This question has long puzzled political scientists and historians. One answer is that people's perceptions of risk often do not match reality: that what we dread most is often not what actually threatens us most. When you got up this morning, you were exposed to serious risks at nearly every stage of your progression from bed to the office. Even lying in bed exposed you to serious hazards: 1 in 400 Americans is injured each year while doing nothing but lying in bed or sitting in a chair--because the headboard collapses, the frame gives way, or another such failure occurs. Your risk of suffering a lethal accident in your bathtub or shower was one in a million.  Your breakfast increased your risk of cancer, heart attack, obesity, or malnutrition, depending on what you ate. Although both margarine and butter appear to contribute to heart disease, a new theory suggests that low-fat diets make you fat. If you breakfasted on grains (even organic ones), you exposed yourself to dangerous toxins: plants produce their own natural pesticides to fight off fungi and herbivores, and many of these are more harmful than synthetic pesticide residues. Your cereal with milk may have been contaminated by mold toxins, including the deadly aflatoxin found in peanuts, corn, and milk. And your eggs may have contained benzene, another known carcinogen. Your cup of coffee included twenty-six compounds known to be mutagenic: if coffee were synthesized in the laboratory, the FDA would probably ban it as a cancer-causing substance.  Most people are more worried about the risks of nuclear power plants than the risks of driving to work, and more alarmed by the prospect of terrorists with chemical weapons than by swimming in a pool. Experts tend to focus on probabilities and outcomes, but public perception of risk seems to depend on other variables: there is little correlation between objective risk and public dread. Examining possible reasons for this discrepancy will help us understand why the thought of terrorists with access to nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons fills us with dread. People tend to exaggerate the likelihood of events that are easy to imagine or recall. Disasters and catastrophes stay disproportionately rooted in the public consciousness, and evoke disproportionate fear. A picture of a mushroom cloud probably stays long in viewers' consciousness as an image of fear.

(II) Avoid Catastrophes! (III) Dismiss\u00a0Extremely\u00a0Remote (''Unrealistic'') Possibilities!\u00a0 \u00a0The first of these is a matter of using the expected-value of the various alternative choices\u00a0--\u00a0computed in the stardard way\u00a0--\u00a0as\u00a0index of their relative preferability. In particular, that alternative whose expected value is maximal is thereby to be viewed as maxipreferable. \u00a0Rule (II) is to be applied subject to an \u201cinsofar as possible\u201d condition. It can ordinarily be implemented by setting the value of a\u00a0catastrophe at\u00a0--\u00a0in the context of expected-value calculation. This, of course, will fail to resolve the matter if it should happen that\u00a0every\u00a0alternative leads to possible catastrophe, in which case--\u00a0that of a dilemma\u00a0--\u00a0special precautions will be necessary. (They are described on pp. 87-88.)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Rule (III) calls on us to implement the idea of ''effectively zero probabilities\u201d by setting the probability of ''extremely remote\u201d possibilities at zero. It calls on us to dismiss highly improbable possibilities as ''unrealistic.'' Note that rules (II) and (III) enjoin us to view the choice-situation in a guise different from the actual facts. An element of\u00a0\u201cas\u00a0if\u201d is involved in both cases. With (II) we are to identify a certain \u201clevel of catastrophe\u201d and take the stance that a negativity whose magnitude exceeds this level is to be seen as having value -- ~.\u00a0Again, with (III) we are to identify a certain level of \u201ceffective zerohood\u201d for probabilities, treating as zero whatever probabilities fall short of this threshold value. Thus in assessing risks by way of expected-value appraisals, we are in each case not to\u00a0view the situation as it actually stands, but to replace the actual situation by its\u00a0policy transform\u00a0through a change of the form\u00a0V--~--\u00b0\u00b0\u00a0orp~0. \u00a0\u00a0The application of all three of these rules calls for essentially judgmental, subjective inputs. With (I) we are involved in negativity-eval~uation. With (II) we must fix on a threshold of ''catastrophe.'' With (III)\u00a0we must decide at what level of\u00a0improbability effective zerohood sets in and possibilities cease to be real. None of these evaluative resolutions at issue is dictated by the objective circumstances and imprinted in the nature of things.\u00a0They are instruments of human devising contrived for human purpose in the effective management of affairs.\u00a0\u00a0To\u00a0begin with, note that rules (I) and (II) can clash, as per\u00a0Figure 1. Here the top alternative enjoys the greater expected\u00a0value. Nevertheless, it is intuitively clear that\u00a0the bottom alter native is far preferable (and would continue to be so even if the 60C loss were increased to some other \u201cordinary\u201d negativity.) The\u00a0clear lesson is that rule (II) takes priority over (I) in such cases\u00a0where catastrophes loom. We are to ignore the ruling of a straightforward calculation of expected values and insist on valuing catastrophes at\u00a0--~,\u00a0so as to avoid them at any (ordinary)\u00a0cost. (Recall the discussion of the rationale of insurance on pp.\u00a079-80 above.) Moreover rules (I) and (III) can also clash. This is shown by those cases where an expected-value calculation rules in favor of an alternative whose probability is too small to qualify it as a \u201creal\u00a0possibility.\u201d (Recall the Vacationer's Dilemma of p. 40.) Unless\u00a0we are prepared to dismiss\u00a0extremely\u00a0remote possibilities as having a probability of \u201ceffectively zero\u201d\u00a0--\u00a0and thus not counting as\u00a0real\u00a0possibilities at all\u00a0--\u00a0we shall find our actions systematically stultified to a degree which we are unwilling to accept in ''real life\u201d situations. It is thus clear that rule (III) takes priority over (I).\u00a0Finally, it is clear that rules\u00a0(II)\u00a0and (III) can also conflict. For consider the situation of Figure 2. Note that a refusal to see the situation in terms of a\u00a0=\u00a00 keeps the catastrophe in the picture, so\u00a0As these deliberations indicate, the three cardinal principles of risk management stand in a relation of preferential rank-order so that: (Ill)\u00a0takes precedence over\u00a0(II),\u00a0which\u00a0in\u00a0turn takes precedence over\u00a0(I). \u00a0We have here a sequential priority-ordering of the several principles, which fixes an automatic process for one's overriding another in those cases where their rulings conflict. \u00a0This precedence ordering entails certain limitations to the reach of classical decision theory, which proceeds on the basis of the unmodified and unadulterated use of expected-value appraisals. A\u00a0deployment of the concepts of catastrophe-avoidance and of \u201ceffectively zero'' probabilities modifies this policy in two directions. First, catastrophe is seen to represent an unacceptable risk, when ''the game's not worth the candle'' because the potential negative\u00a0outcomes, unlikely though their realization\u00a0may be, are simply too massive for the stakes otherwise at issue. But, secondly, this principle itself needs to be curtailed, when it becomes\u00a0too\u00a0conservative in its operation and leads to a stultification of action. Just this rationale motivates the recourse to ''effectively zero'' probabilities.

Probability of Rare Events, October 4, 2006 ", "The concept of fault trees and reliability trees has a long history in space and nuclear industry.\u00a0 Several books (Krouwer, 2004) and papers describe this tool (Marx and Slonim, 2003).\u00a0 The first step in conducting fault trees is to identify the sentinel adverse event that should be analyzed.\u00a0 Then all possible ways in which the sentinel event may occur is listed.\u00a0 It is possible that several events must co-occur before the sentinel event may occur.\u00a0 For example, in assessing the probability of an employee providing information to outsiders, several events must co-occur.\u00a0 First the employee must be disgruntled.\u00a0 Second, information must be available to the employee.\u00a0 Third, outsiders must have contact with the employee.\u00a0 Fourth, the employee must have a method of transferring the data.\u00a0 All of these events must co-occur before hospital data is sold to an outside party.\u00a0 None of these events are sufficient to cause the sentinel event.\u00a0 In a fault tree, when several events must co-occur, we use an \"And\" gate to show it.\u00a0 Each of these events can, in part, depend on other factors.\u00a0 For example, there may be several ways to transfer the data:\u00a0 on paper, electronically by email, or electronically on disk.\u00a0 Any one of these events can lead to transfer of data.\u00a0 In fault tree when any one of a series of events may be sufficient by themselves to cause the next event to occur, we show this by an \"Or\" gate.\u00a0 Fault tree is a collection of events connected to each other by \"and\" and \"Or\" gates.\u00a0 Each event depends on a series of other related events, providing for a complex web of relationships.\u00a0 A fault tree suggests a robust work process when several events must co-occur before the catastrophic failure occurs.\u00a0 The more \"And\" gates are in the tree structure, the more robust the work process modeled.\u00a0 In contrast, it is also possible for several events by themselves to lead to catastrophic failure.\u00a0 The more \"Or\" gates in the path to failure, the less robust the work process.\u00a0The second step is to estimate probabilities for the fault tree.\u00a0 Since the catastrophic failure is rare, it is difficult to asses this probability directly.\u00a0 Instead, the probability of various events leading to this failure are assessed.\u00a0 For example, the probability of a finding a disgruntled employee can be assessed.\u00a0 The probability of an employee having access to large data sets can be assessed by counting employees who have such access during the course of their work.\u00a0 The probability of an employee being approached by someone to sell data can be assessed by providing an expert data on frequency of reported crimes and asking him/her to estimate the additional unreported rate.\u00a0 In short, through objective data or subjective opinions of experts various probabilities in the fault tree can be assessed.\u00a0\u00a0 The fault tree can then be used to assess the probability of the catastrophic and rare event using the following formula:",

New Approach to Moral Theory Selection ", "", "", "The language of \u201cdata\u201d to be accounted for recurs even more frequently in papers published in the wake of Rawls\u2019s book. Singer writes that \u201cThe reflective equilibrium conception of moral philosophy . . . lead[s] us to think of our particular moral judgmentsas data against which moral theories are to be tested\u201d (1974, p. 517; cf. 1998, p. vi), and  Nicholas Rescher writes that our intuitions \u201care the data . . . which the theoretician must  weave into a smooth fabric\u201d and that \u201cThe process is closely analogous with the  systematization of the \u2018data\u2019 of various levels in natural science\u201d (1979, p. 155). Others  have offered similar characterizations.13  So the notion of accounting for the data is often regarded as providing support for  reflective equilibrium. I wish to argue, though, that the notion of accounting for the data can be seen to provide such support only when clouded by a pair of misunderstandings, and that when these two misunderstandings are removed, the notion of accounting for the data actually lends support to practical equilibrium. The two misunderstandings concern what the data to be accounted for actually are, and how a moral theory accounts for whatever data it accounts for. ", "First, consider what the data actually are. When it comes to our moral intuitions, we might think that our data are that acts of certain kinds, such as acts of punishing the innocent, are never justified. But actually this overstates our data: in fact our data are just our observations of our own intuitions, such as our observation that it seems to us that punishing the innocent is never justified. It is a further claim, not among the data to be  accounted for, that these intuitions that we are aware of having are correct. The data do not include that certain acts are wrong; the data include only our regarding certain acts as wrong\u2014for this latter phenomenon, our own judgment of the matter, is all that we can really detect in any instance of moral appraisal.14 So the first error in reflective equilibrium\u2019s use of the notion of accounting for the data lies in its holding theories responsible for accounting for things that are not actually among the data. It says that a moral theory must explain the truth of the intuitions that we have, when actually the only data there are are that we have those intuitions. Now at this point it may appear that I am arguing that what the notion of accounting for the data means in the case of a moral theory is not that the theory explains the truth of the intuitions that we have, but that the theory explains the fact that we have those intuitions. For this interpretation of accounting for the data would accommodate the interpretation of what the data actually are that I have just been arguing for. But Imaintain that we need to make a second adjustment in order to arrive at a sound interpretation of the notion of accounting for the data in the case of a moral theory. Whereas the first adjustment had to do with what the data are, this one has to do with what it means for a moral theory to account for data. What I have in mind is that we need to say that what a moral theory is supposed to do, as far as its accounting for anything is concerned, is not to explain our having certain intuitions, but to endorse our having those intuitions. The reason for this adjustment is simple: moral theories differ from scientific ones in that they are not in the business of predicting or explaining anything: they are in the business of prescribing, or giving instructions. Normally, the instructions we\u2019re interested in are those that concern specific situations in which we might engage in some conduct or  regard to the intuitions we should have "], "id": "399c65d739bd94632854daee101eb7896c4190b7948bd564ed00df76b280168f", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[6, 350, 441], [6, 441, 441], [6, 443, 522], [6, 522, 522], [6, 524, 591], [6, 798, 1106], [6, 1107, 1111], [6, 1112, 1168], [6, 1169, 1177], [6, 1178, 1212], [7, 244, 401], [7, 1895, 2015], [7, 2016, 2023], [7, 2024, 2061], [7, 2062, 2069], [7, 2070, 2322]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 12]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2002-01-01"}, {"tag": "Risk assessment irrationally exaggerates low probability impacts.

People's perceptions frequently fail to match up with the actual dangers risks pose and few people have a \"feel\" for what a chance of dying, say a chance of one in a million, really means. Research by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman has shown that we are regularly led astray in our assessments of probabilities by rules of thumb. Faced with a judgment that requires even a minimal familiarity with statistics, we frequently avoid the statistical information and rely instead on a description or heuristic which feels less strange.  We tend to overemphasize low probabilities and underestimate large ones. We have to struggle to resist the gambler's fallacy: the belief that after a series of losses the odds must favor a win. We are also poor judges of outcomes. We appear to be more concerned to avoid a loss than to receive an equivalent gain, and this asymmetry can be exploited in the way choices are presented. Retailers, for example, know enough about our suceptibility to the way options are framed to represent a surcharge for credit card customers as a discount to those who are willing to pay cash.  The influence of framing on judgments about risk is systematic and pervasive, and shows up at all levels of education. Health care professionals are no less susceptible to the effects of framing than their patients who have less experience and lack their expertise. The following hypothetical case was put to a group of physicians: Imagine that you have operable lung cancer and must choose between two treatments: surgery and radiation therapy. Of 100 people having surgery, 10 die during the operation, 32 are dead after one year, and 66 after five years.  Of 100 people having radiation therapy, none die during treatment, 23 are deadafter one year, and 78 after five years. Which treatment do you prefer? Given these options, fifty percent of the physicians said they preferred radiation treatment. However when the same options were presented in terms of survival rates rather than mortality rates, 84% said they would prefer surgery.  It is perhaps not completely surprising to learn that people are poor judges of probabilities, but \"we want to give [people] credit for at least knowing their own minds,\" as one report puts it, \"when it comes to assigning values to the outcomes of their choices.\" Apparently, very little credit is due, as experiment after experiment reveals:  Imagine that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual flu epidemic which is expected to kill 600 people, unless action is taken. Two alternative programs to combat the disease are proposed If program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 will be saved and a 2/3 probability that no one will be saved When the alternatives were posed in these terms in a test survey, 72 percent of the respondents opted for program A, only 28 percent for program B. A second group was given the same options, but re-described (re-framed) in this way: If program A is adopted, 400 people will die; if program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die This time only 22 percent opted for the first program, while 78 percent opted for the second. It is generally believed that consistency in judgments is a minimal condition of rationality. Since our judgments about risk are apparently inconsistent, it is hard not to draw the conclusion that our attitudes towards risk are also irrational. These findings have disturbing implications for public policy, especially in a society like our own which relies on a democratic process. If we are irrational in our judgments about risk, the policies we enact will reflect a similar bias. Given our untrustworthy attitudes, a consent-based approach to legitimating risk-imposing activities can only lead to irrational public policies.

How Can We Know?\u201d (Princeton; $35), that\u00a0people who make prediction their business\u2014people who appear as experts on television, get quoted in newspaper articles, advise governments and businesses, and participate in punditry roundtables\u2014are no better than the rest of us.\u00a0When they\u2019re wrong, they\u2019re rarely held accountable, and they rarely admit it, either. They insist that they were just off on timing, or blindsided by an improbable event, or almost right, or wrong for the right reasons. They have the same repertoire of self-justifications that everyone has, and are no more inclined than anyone else to revise their beliefs about the way the world works, or ought to work, just because they made a mistake. No one is paying you for your gratuitous opinions about other people, but the experts are being paid, and Tetlock claims that the better known and more frequently quoted they are, the less reliable their guesses about the future are likely to be. The accuracy of an expert\u2019s predictions actually has an inverse relationship to his or her self-confidence, renown, and, beyond a certain point, depth of knowledge. People who follow current events by reading the papers and newsmagazines regularly can guess what is likely to happen about as accurately as the specialists whom the papers quote. Our system of expertise is completely inside out: it rewards bad judgments over good ones. \u201cExpert Political Judgment\u201d is not a work of media criticism.\u00a0Tetlock is a psychologist\u2014he teaches at Berkeley\u2014and his conclusions are based on a long-term study that he began twenty years ago.\u00a0He picked two hundred and eighty-four people who made their living \u201ccommenting or offering advice on political and economic trends,\u201d and he started asking them to assess the probability that various things would or would not come to pass, both in the areas of the world in which they specialized and in areas about which they were not expert. Would there be a nonviolent end to apartheid in South Africa? Would Gorbachev be ousted in a coup? Would the United States go to war in the Persian Gulf? Would Canada disintegrate? (Many experts believed that it would, on the ground that Quebec would succeed in seceding.) And so on. By the end of the study, in 2003, the experts had made 82,361 forecasts. Tetlock also asked questions designed to determine how they reached their judgments, how they reacted when their predictions proved to be wrong, how they evaluated new information that did not support their views, and how they assessed the probability that rival theories and predictions were accurate. Tetlock got a statistical handle on his task by putting most of the forecasting questions into a \u201cthree possible futures\u201d form. The respondents were asked to rate the probability of three alternative outcomes: the persistence of the status quo, more of something (political freedom, economic growth), or less of something (repression, recession). And he measured his experts on two dimensions: how good they were at guessing probabilities (did all the things they said had an x per cent chance of happening happen x per cent of the time?), and how accurate they were at predicting specific outcomes. The results were unimpressive. On the first scale, the\u00a0experts performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned an equal probability to all three outcomes\u2014if they had given each possible future a thirty-three-per-cent chance of occurring.\u00a0Human beings who spend their lives studying the state of the world, in other words, are poorer forecasters than dart-throwing monkeys,\u00a0who would have distributed their picks evenly over the three choices.", ""], "id": "9990427429f4f0337aa07435db6fa36c07b7f1414a8ca784f03f7ac2048f93e5", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 327, 368], [2, 369, 397], [2, 522, 556], [2, 557, 575], [2, 577, 613], [2, 614, 635], [2, 644, 648], [2, 854, 997], [2, 1125, 1210], [2, 1228, 1231], [2, 1246, 1325], [2, 1391, 1409], [2, 1744, 1769], [2, 1770, 1874], [2, 3479, 3508], [2, 3534, 3649], [2, 3649, 3650], [2, 3734, 3867], [2, 3867, 3868]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6], [27, 29]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2005-01-01"}, {"tag": "Refusing their method is critical to move away from this bad form of risk - rejection within the laboratory of debate spills over to policy making", "cite": "Herbeck, Prof at Boston College, 92", "body": ["", "It is sometimes argued that debate is a laboratory for testing argumentation.

Although there is still a fairly broad range of differing estimates that responsible thinkers could make, it is nonetheless arguable that because the negative utility of an existential disaster is so enormous, the objective of reducing existential risks should be a dominant consideration when acting out of concern for humankind as a whole. It may be useful to adopt the following rule of thumb for moral action; we can call it\u00a0Maxipok:  Maximize the probability of an okay outcome, where an \u201cokay outcome\u201d is any outcome that avoids existential disaster.  At best, this is a rule of thumb, a prima facie suggestion, rather than a principle of absolute validity, since there clearly\u00a0are\u00a0other moral objectives than preventing terminal global disaster. Its usefulness consists in helping us to get our priorities straight. Moral action is always at risk to diffuse its efficacy on feel-good projects[24]\u00a0rather on serious work that has the best chance of fixing the worst ills. The cleft between the feel-good projects and what really has the greatest potential for good is likely to be especially great in regard to existential risk. Since the goal is somewhat abstract and since existential risks don\u2019t currently cause suffering in any living creature[25], there is less of a feel-good dividend to be derived from efforts that seek to reduce them. This suggests an offshoot moral project, namely to reshape the popular moral perception so as to give more credit and social approbation to those who devote their time and resources to benefiting humankind via global safety compared to other philanthropies.  Maxipok, a kind of satisficing rule, is different from\u00a0Maximin\u00a0(\u201cChoose the action that has the best worst-case outcome.\u201d)[26]. Since we cannot completely eliminate existential risks (at any moment we could be sent into the dustbin of cosmic history by the advancing front of a vacuum phase transition triggered in a remote galaxy a billion years ago) using maximin in the present context has the consequence that we should choose the act that has the greatest benefits under the assumption of impending extinction.

Risk assessment was developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a systematic way to evaluate the degree and likelihood of harmful side effects from products and technologies. With precise, quantitative risk assessments in hand, regulators could more convincingly demonstrate the need for action. Risk assessments would stand up in court. Risk assessments could \"prove\" that a product was dangerous, would cause a certain number of deaths per million, and should be taken off the market. Or not. Quantitative risk assessment, which became standard practice in the United States in the mid-1980s and was institutionalized in the global trade agreements of the 1990s, turned out to be most useful in \"proving\" that a product or technology was not inordinately dangerous. More precisely, risk assessments presented sets of numbers that purported to state definitively how much harm might occur. The next question for policymakers then became: How much harm is acceptable? Quantitative risk assessment not only provided the answers; it dictated the questions. As quantitative risk assessment became the norm, commercial and industrial interests were increasingly able to insist that harm must be proven \"scientifically\" -- in the form of a quantitative risk assessment demonstrating harm in excess of acceptable limits -- before action was taken to stop a process or product. These exercises were often linked with cost-benefit assessments that heavily weighted the immediate monetary costs of regulations and gave little, if any, weight to costs to the environment or future generations. Although risk assessments tried to account for uncertainties, those projections were necessarily subject to assumptions and simplifications. Quantitative risk assessments usually addressed a limited number of potential harms, often missing social, cultural or broader environmental factors.

Most statements of the Precautionary Principle say it applies when there is reason to believe serious or irreversible harm may occur. Those reasons are based on scientific evidence of various kinds: studies, observations, precedents, experience, professional judgment.

Scientific standards of certainty are high in experimental science or for accepting or refuting a hypothesis, and well they should be.

All\u00a0practical reasoning involves weighing risks against one another, calculating probabilities, ring-fencing\u00a0uncertainties,\u00a0 taking account of relative\u00a0benefits and costs.\u00a0This\u00a0mode of reasoning\u00a0is\u00a0\u00a0instinctive to us and has ensured our\u00a0extraordinary\u00a0success as a species.\u00a0 There is a branch of mathematics-decision theory-devoted to formalizing it,\u00a0 and there is nothing in decision theory that looks like the\u00a0 Precautionary\u00a0\u00a0 Principle.\u00a0 For\u00a0the effect of this principle is to isolate each risk as\u00a0 though it were entirely independent\u00a0of every other.\u00a0Risks, according to the\u00a0 principle,\u00a0come single-wrapped, and each demands the same\u00a0 response-namely-Don't!\u00a0If, in obeying this command, you find yourself\u00a0 taking another risk, then the answer again is \"Don't!\"\u00a0The principle is therefore logically on a par with the command\u00a0given by an\u00a0\u00a0 American president to his senior civil servant: \"Don't just do something,\u00a0 stand there!\"\u00a0But, as the president realized, standing there is not something that civil servants are very good at. Bureaucrats have an inveterate need to be seen to be doing something.\u00a0The effect of the\u00a0 principle therefore is to forbid the one identified risk, while removing\u00a0 all others from the equation. What this means can be vividly seen from a\u00a0 recent instance.\u00a0A European directive, responding to the slight risk that\u00a0 diseased animals might enter\u00a0the\u00a0human food\u00a0chain,\u00a0insists that all\u00a0 slaughter should now take place in the presence of a qualified vet,\u00a0who\u00a0 must inspect each animal as it arrives at the abattoir.\u00a0There is no\u00a0 evidence that veterinary examination\u00a0in these circumstances\u00a0is either\u00a0 necessary or\u00a0(in the rare cases when infected animals come to the abattoir)\u00a0\u00a0effective.\u00a0Nevertheless, the\u00a0 Precautionary Principle\u00a0 delivered its usual\u00a0 result, and the edict was imposed.\u00a0Small abattoirs\u00a0all over Britain\u00a0were\u00a0 forced to close down, since their profit margins are as narrow as those of\u00a0 the farmers whom they serve, and qualified vets require fees that reflect\u00a0 their qualifications.\u00a0\u00a0The effect\u00a0of this on husbandry,on the social and economic life of farming communities, and\u00a0on the viability of\u00a0small pasture farms has been devastating, the effect on animal welfare equally so.\u00a0Instead of travelling\u00a0 a quarter of an hour to the local abattoir, our herds must now travel three\u00a0 or four hours to one of the great processing plants that enjoy the presence\u00a0 of a permanent vet. Farmers who have taken pride in their animals and cared\u00a0 for them through two or more winters are distressed to part with them on\u00a0 such terms, and the animals themselves suffer greatly.\u00a0This damage\u00a0done to\u00a0 the relation be-tween farmer and herd\u00a0has further adverse effects on the\u00a0 landscape.\u00a0Unable to take full responsibility for the life and the death of\u00a0 his animals, a farmer ceases to see the pointof his unprofitable trade. The\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0small pasture farms\u00a0that created the landscape of England\u00a0are\u00a0now\u00a0rapidly\u00a0 disappearing, to be replaced by faceless agro-businesses or equestrian\u00a0 leisure centers.\u00a0This damages our landscape, and in doing so damages our\u00a0 sense of nationhood,\u00a0of which the landscape has been the most potent\u00a0 symbol.\u00a0 As if those long-term costs were not bad enough, we have also had to endure\u00a0 the short-term cost of hoof-and-mouth disease, which in the past would\u00a0 usually be contained in the locality where it broke out. In its latest\u00a0 occurrence, the disease was immediately carried all over the country by\u00a0 animals on their way to some distant abattoir. The result was the\u00a0 temporary, but total, ruination of our livestock farming.\u00a0 Now,\u00a0a responsible politician would have taken into account, not only the\u00a0 small risk addressed by the directive, but also the huge risks posed to the\u00a0 farming community\u00a0by the destruction of local abattoirs, the risks posed to\u00a0 animals by long journeys, the benefits of localized food production and\u00a0 local markets for meat, and so on. And he would have a motive for\u00a0 considering all those things, namely, his desire to be re-elected, when the\u00a0 consequences of his decision had been felt.\u00a0As a rational being, he\u00a0[or she]\u00a0would\u00a0 recognize that risks do not come in atomic particles, but are parts of\u00a0 complex organisms, shaped by the flow of events.\u00a0And he would know in his\u00a0 heart that there is no more risky practice than that of disaggregating\u00a0 risks, so as one by one to forbid them. Even bureaucrats, in their own\u00a0 private lives, will take the same line. They too are rational beings and\u00a0 know that risks must constantly be taken and constantly weighed against\u00a0 each other. However, when a bureaucrat legislates for others and suffers no\u00a0 cost should he get things wrong, he will inevitably look for a single and\u00a0 specific problem and seize on a single and absolute principle in order to\u00a0\u00a0 solve it. The result is the\u00a0 Precautionary Principle\u00a0 and all the follies\u00a0 that are now issuing from the unconscionable use of it.\u00a0\u00a0This suggests another and deeper irrationality in the principle.\u00a0It is\u00a0 right that legislators should take risks into account, but not that they\u00a0 should automatically forbid them, even when they can make a show of\u00a0 isolating them from all other relevant factors. For\u00a0there is an even\u00a0 greater risk attached to the habit of avoiding risks-namely, that we will\u00a0 produce a society that has no ability to\u00a0 survive\u00a0 a real emergency when\u00a0 risk-taking is the only recourse.\u00a0 It is not absurd to think that this is a real danger. How many a soporific\u00a0 Empire, secure in its long-standing abundance, has been swept away by\u00a0 barbarian hordes, simply because the basileus or caliph had spent his life\u00a0 in risk-free palaces? History is replete with warnings against the habit of\u00a0 heeding every warning. Yet this is the habit that the\u00a0 Precautionary\u00a0\u00a0 Principle\u00a0 furthers.\u00a0By laying an absolute edict against risk, it is\u00a0 courting the greatest risk of all, namely, that we shall face our next\u00a0 collective emergency without the only thing that would enable us to\u00a0 survive it.\u00a0\u00a0"], "id": "ef3c0d72fcdd278ad6b50296799ed6885332610041f639632c8834a1c42e7642", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 0, 28], [3, 37, 86], [3, 92, 141], [3, 141, 142], [3, 142, 142], [3, 250, 395], [3, 424, 424], [3, 425, 447], [3, 447, 447], [3, 457, 470], [3, 617, 707], [3, 721, 721], [3, 722, 735], [3, 764, 764], [3, 765, 783], [3, 785, 789], [3, 808, 810], [3, 812, 849], [3, 864, 884], [3, 1057, 1148], [3, 1166, 1200], [3, 1202, 1272], [3, 1376, 1438], [3, 1502, 1540], [3, 1714, 1835], [3, 1898, 1984], [3, 1989, 1999], [3, 1999, 1999], [3, 2006, 2006], [3, 2007, 2091], [3, 2091, 2092], [3, 2092, 2092], [3, 2154, 2203], [3, 2203, 2203], [3, 2226, 2226], [3, 2227, 2250], [3, 2250, 2250], [3, 2315, 2324], [3, 2326, 2424], [3, 2426, 2441], [3, 2441, 2441], [3, 2459, 2485], [3, 2639, 2649], [3, 2649, 2649], [3, 2671, 2730], [3, 2730, 2730], [3, 2750, 2750], [3, 2751, 2832], [3, 3217, 3228], [3, 3276, 3321], [3, 3467, 3486], [3, 3525, 3528], [3, 3528, 3528], [3, 3532, 3532], [3, 3533, 3629], [3, 3631, 3707], [3, 4192, 4356], [3, 4356, 4356], [3, 4677, 4700], [3, 4700, 4700], [3, 4701, 4709], [3, 4709, 4709], [3, 4710, 4836], [3, 5515, 5578], [3, 5782, 5981], [3, 6376, 6577], [3, 6577, 6577]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 37]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2004-01-01"}, {"tag": "The Precautionary principle causes complete stultification, everything has some risk of an impact", "cite": "Hathcock, Council for Responsible Nutrition, 00", "body": ["J.N.

The result is a lopsided process that is inherently biased against change and\u00a0therefore against\u00a0innovation.\u00a0To see why, one must understand that there are two basic kinds of mistaken decisions that a regulator can make: First, a harmful product can be approved for marketing \u2014 called a Type I error in the parlance of risk analysis. Second, a useful product can be rejected or delayed, can fail to achieve approval at all, or can be inappropriately withdrawn from the market \u2014 a Type II error.\u00a0In other words,\u00a0a regulator commits a Type I error by permitting something harmful\u00a0to happen\u00a0and a Type II error by preventing something beneficial\u00a0from becoming available.\u00a0Both situations have negative consequences for the public, but the outcomes for the regulator are very different. Examples of this Type I-Type II error dichotomy in both the U.S. and Europe abound, but it is perhaps illustrated most clearly in the FDA\u2019s approval process for new drugs. A classic example is the FDA\u2019s approval in 1976 of the swine flu vaccine \u2014 generally perceived as a Type I error because while the vaccine was effective at preventing influenza, it had a major side effect that was unknown at the time of approval: A small number of patients suffered temporary paralysis from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. This kind of mistake is highly visible and has immediate consequences: The media pounce and the public and Congress are roused, and Congress takes up the matter. Both the developers of the product and the regulators who allowed it to be marketed are excoriated and punished in such modern-day pillories as congressional hearings, television newsmagazines, and newspaper editorials.\u00a0Because a regulatory official\u2019s career might be damaged irreparably by his\u00a0[or her]\u00a0good-faith but\u00a0mistaken approval of a high-profile product, decisions are often made defensively\u00a0\u2014 in other words,\u00a0above all to avoid Type I errors.\u00a0\u00a0Former FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt aptly summarized the regulator\u2019s dilemma: In all our FDA history, we are unable to find a single instance where a Congressional committee investigated the failure of FDA to approve a new drug. But, the times when hearings have been held to criticize our approval of a new drug have been so frequent that we have not been able to count them. The message to FDA staff could not be clearer. Whenever a controversy over a new drug is resolved by approval of the\u00a0 drug, the agency and the individuals involved likely will be investigated.\u00a0Whenever such a drug is disapproved, no inquiry will be made.\u00a0The\u00a0Congressional pressure for negative action is, therefore,\u00a0intense.\u00a0And\u00a0it seems to be\u00a0ever increasing. Type II errors in the form of excessive governmental requirements and unreasonable decisions can cause a new product to be \u201cdisapproved,\u201d in Schmidt\u2019s phrase, or to have its approval delayed.\u00a0Unnecessary\u00a0or capricious\u00a0delays are anathema to innovators, and they lessen competition and inflate the ultimate price of the product.\u00a0Consider the FDA\u2019s precipitate response to the 1999 death of a patient in a University of Pennsylvania gene therapy trial for a genetic disease. The cause of the incident had not been identified and the product class (a preparation of the needed gene, encased in an enfeebled adenovirus that would then be administered to the patient) had been used in a large number of patients, with no fatalities and serious side effects in only a small percentage of patients. But given the high profile of the incident, regulators acted disproportionately. They not only stopped the trial in which the fatality occurred and all the other gene-therapy studies at the same university, but also halted similar studies at other universities, as well as experiments using adenovirus being conducted by the drug company Schering-Plough \u2014 one for the treatment of liver cancer, the other for colorectal cancer that had metastasized to the liver. By these actions, and by publicly excoriating and humiliating the researchers involved (and halting experiments of theirs that did not even involve adenovirus), the FDA cast a pall over the entire field of gene therapy, setting it back perhaps as much as a decade.\u00a0Although they can dramatically compromise public health,\u00a0Type II errors caused by a regulator\u2019s bad judgment,\u00a0timidity, or anxiety\u00a0seldom gain public attention.\u00a0It may be only the employees of the company that makes the product and a few stock market analysts and investors who are knowledgeable about unnecessary delays. And if the regulator\u2019s mistake precipitates a corporate decision to abandon the product, cause and effect are seldom connected in the public mind. Naturally, the companies themselves are loath to complain publicly about a mistaken FDA judgment, because the agency has so much discretionary control over their ability to test and market products. As a consequence, there may be no direct evidence of, or publicity about, the lost societal benefits, to say nothing of the culpability of regulatory officials.\u00a0 Exceptions exist, of course. A few activists, such as the AIDS advocacy groups that closely monitor the FDA, scrutinize agency review of certain products and aggressively publicize Type II errors. In addition, congressional oversight should provide a check on regulators\u2019 performance, but as noted above by former FDA Commissioner Schmidt, only rarely does oversight focus on their Type II errors. Type I errors make for more dramatic hearings, after all, including injured patients and their family members. And even when such mistakes are exposed, regulators frequently defend Type II errors as erring on the side of caution \u2014 in effect, invoking the precautionary principle \u2014 as they did in the wake of the University of Pennsylvania gene therapy case. Too often this euphemism is accepted uncritically by legislators, the media, and the public, and our system of pharmaceutical oversight becomes progressively less responsive to the public interest.\u00a0 The FDA is not unique in this regard, of course. All regulatory agencies are subject to the same sorts of social and political pressures that cause them to be castigated when dangerous products accidentally make it to market (even if, as is often the case, those products produce net benefits) but to escape blame when they keep beneficial products out of the hands of consumers.Adding the precautionary principle\u2019s bias against new products into the public policy mix further encourages regulators to commit Type II errors\u00a0in their frenzy to avoid Type I errors. This is hardly conducive to enhancing overall public safety."], "id": "bd3d41b8914103e39b10f4a223536f9fbb4e438e081f1884158d00b84048289d", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 38, 160], [3, 230, 230], [3, 231, 337], [3, 339, 429], [3, 434, 467], [3, 469, 493], [3, 498, 529], [3, 530, 539], [3, 553, 636], [3, 655, 665], [3, 1069, 1135], [3, 1146, 1200], [3, 2227, 2301], [3, 2301, 2301], [3, 2302, 2310], [3, 2326, 2407], [3, 2426, 2458], [3, 3099, 3102], [3, 3102, 3102], [3, 3103, 3148], [3, 3161, 3168], [3, 3170, 3173], [3, 3189, 3204], [3, 3398, 3409], [3, 3424, 3532], [3, 4726, 4782], [3, 4783, 4835], [3, 4835, 4835], [3, 4857, 4885], [3, 6890, 7034], [3, 7035, 7135]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 53]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2001-01-01"}, {"tag": "Innovation key to life saving medical tech", "cite": "Miller, Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, 01", "body": ["Activists have since extended their antichlorine campaign to so-called \u201cendocrine disrupters,\u201d or modulators, asserting that certain primarily man-made chemicals mimic or interfere with human hormones (especially estrogens) in the body and thereby cause a range of abnormalities and diseases related to the endocrine system.\u00a0The American Council on Science and Health has explored the endocrine disrupter hypothesis and found that while high doses of certain environmental contaminants produce toxic effects in laboratory test animals \u2014 in some cases involving the endocrine system \u2014 humans\u2019 actual exposure to these suspected endocrine modulators is many orders of magnitude lower.

Many of the poor will try to migrate to more prosperous countries which will resist more actively what might easily become an uncontrolled invasion. Mass migration is a phenomenon closely associated with the human expansion over the past ten thousand years. It is tied to the instinct of the hunter-gatherer that if food becomes scarce in one region, population migrates to a region of greater abundance. However, in an overcrowded world this does not work. Mass migration merely spreads chaos and misery throughout the globe. A profound change is needed. The era of mass migration is coming to an end. It is impossible that even a significant proportion of the current global annual population expansion of about seventy-nine million a year (Population Reference Bureau, 2003), almost all of which is occurring in undeveloped nations, could be incorporated into developed nations.

Overpopulation shows up in quality of life and cost of living. Repeatedly one sees least those who wish to, will see that more people mean more problems from pollution, crowding, and resource scarcity because even conservationists pollute and consume. The costs of adjusting (i.e., decently accommodating more and more people in the same amount of space and with the same fund of natural resources) are monetized. Garbage is the topic of the hour. In just a few years, dumping fees in U.S. cities have skyrocketed, from $5 or $10 a ton to an average of over $150. Burning questions are whether to incinerate or not, how to recycle, and how to make money from one's ash heap. The rising cost of water in areas that are not naturally arid makes the same point. Even if the quantity of water is sufficient, purity tends to suffer when population density grows. It costs money to keep clean or clean up. A 1992 Wall Street Journal account (Poor Pay, 1992) states that \"Boston water and sewer bills have risen 39% in the past two years as the costs of cleaning up Boston Harbor have been phased into rates.\" In 1991, the average household paid $500 a year in water and sewer bills, and \"water shutoffs as a result of nonpayment of water bills\u2026tripled.\" Demands on the public sector also increase as population grows. Taxes invariably rise to meet the higher demand for education, social services, health care, law enforcement, infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, prisons, systems for human transportation, and disposal of sewage and other wastes. Concurrently, systems are often left to deteriorate, an attractive option because taxpayers and users may not see meaningful gains even with higher spending. Infrastructure is decaying nationwide, but goes unnoticed until a bridge collapses, sewers leak, or tunnels cave in. The disappearance of natural capital is equally silent, but it is continuing at a great rate and is compromising future production. Iowa has lost 50 percent of its topsoil since the advent of farming in the nineteenth century. The drawdown of U.S. aquifers is also proceeding quickly and, so far, has led to abandonment of over 300,000 formerly irrigated acres in Arizona alone. Seventy-five percent of irrigation is threatened in Nebraska. Good air, land, water, and energy are the nuts and jolts of carrying capacity. It is not trivial for the sustainability of our society that, as summarized by Carrying Capacity Network (1991), the United States is \"currently losing topsoil 18 times faster than [it is being replaced; or that] groundwater,\u2026much of which we stored during the Ice Age and is nonrenewable, is currently being pumped out of the ground 25 percent faster than it is being replenished.\" Substitution for very basic inputs such as soil and fresh water will be difficult. Moreover, there may be an interactive effect: Up to now, irrigation and petroleum-based fertilizers have compensated for deterioration in the innate productivity of the land. But even a temporary rise in the price of petroleum, if it led to cutbacks on fertilizer use, could unmask the hidden cost of topsoil loss. When farmers recognize that their long-term income stream is jeopardized by present farming practices, they are likely to shift toward a more sustainable process. Holding farmers' capital their soil intact will have the immediate result of lowering production to below what can be realized by current, soil depleting agricultural methods. Most of the world's 5.5 billion people are becoming poorer as they compete against each other for jobs. Most lose purchasing power on a yearly basis. Increasing numbers drop out of the consumer market altogether, exerting no effective demand. Thus; it was a fact that December, 1990, oat and wheat prices sank to their lowest levels since 1972 while more people than before starved or lived on the edge of famine. The multitudes do not bid up prices. Quality of life and environmental health, not commodity prices, are clues that the carrying capacity is being exceeded.

Pimentel and Giampietro have concluded that U.S. population growth is a primary cause of these harsh potential outcomes. The study explains that the United States is the fastest-growing industrialized country in the world, now increasing by approximately three million people per year. This population growth rata is equivalent to adding 58,000 people per week or a city the size of Washington, D.C. to our country every year. The overall growth rate of the U.S. population has escalated in large part because of the unprecedented number of immigrants that have been allowed to come into the United States and their disproportionately higher birth rates compared to the native-born. About half of U.S. population growth is currently the result of immigration. On-going soil erosion and expanding urbanization contribute to the continuous loss of cropland in the U.S. Annually, more than two million acres of prime cropland are lost to erosion, salinization, and waterlogging. In addition, more than one million acres are removed from cultivation as America's limited arable land is Overwhelmed by the demands of urbanization, transportation networks, and industry. As a result of arable land shortages, U.S. meat consumption may be reduced. The groundwater that provides 31% of the water used in agriculture is being depleted up to 160% faster than its recharge rate. The vast U.S. Ogallala aquifer (under Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas) will likely become non-productive within the next 40 years. Even if water management is substantially improved, the projected 520 million Americans in 2050 would have about 700 gallons/day/capita, considered the minimum for all human needs, including agriculture. The availability of non-renewable fossil energy explains in part the historically high productivity of U.S. agriculture. Currently the 400 gallons of oil equivalents expended to feed each American amount to about 17% of all energy used in this country each year. Yet given current use levels, only 15 to 20 years of oil resources remain in the U.S. Although imports now account for 58% of oil used in the U.S., these international reserves are expected to be exhausted within the next 30 to 50 years. Population growth reduces self-sufficiency in food, availability of vital natural resources, standard of living, and ultimately U.S. national security. The United States is in a privileged situation compared to many other nations in the world because its per capita endowment of natural resources is relatively high based on its current population density. However, the United States is at serious risk of losing this privilege if attention is not given to the control of population growth (including immigration), the sustainable management of natural resources, and the development of alternative energy sources. Food security depends on ample fertile land, fresh water, energy, and protecting biodiversity of plant and animal species.

This growth has imposed huge and ever-increasing pressures on Earth's ecosystems, prompting fears concerning the integrity of their life-supporting functions and the high rate of extinction of species. Quite simply, ecological degradation threatens the interests and possibly the survival of future human populations. By the criterion of ecological sustainability, and given our current consumption rates and technologies, Earth is now overpopulated. In such times of great and threatening change it is important to reconsider human goals and enabling strategies. A fundamental goal is the sustained quality survival of human populations. Achieving this requires new paradigms of understanding and management, especially the realization that the human economic and social spheres are dependent on healthy, functioning ecosystems, and that most forms of growth are unsustainable. Socio-economic development must become ecologically sustainable with the maintenance of Earth's life-support systems assuming priority. Developing integrated ecosystem management, cutting consumption, and negotiating optimum population sizes would be useful. This paper discusses these issues with emphasis on the Australian situation. The most critical task facing humanity today is the creation of a shared vision of a sustainable and desirable society. (Robert Costanza 2000: 1) Change is now pervasive and rapid. According to the British Prime Minister, 'the rate of economic, geopolitical, industrial and social change is quicker than at any time in our history' (Blair 1995: 3). The one form of change Blair did not mention--ecological change--is also arguably the most important. Omissions notwithstanding, all these changes have been driven by growth; for example, the global population has multiplied by four and world economic production by 20 since 1900 (Meadows, Meadows and Randers 1992). This growth has caused huge degradation to Earth's ecosystems and brought fears that their structures and life-support functions are being progressively weakened (Lubchenko et al. 1991; Risser, Lubchenko and Levin 1991; Vitousek et al. 1997; World Resources Institute 2000). Despite attempts to play down the severity of the situation (e.g. Lomborg 200l), it seems certain that a continuation of these damaging forms of growth will further degrade nature and this will compromise the options and possibly even the survival of future generations (Laurance 2001).", "These fears have been recognized internationally by Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, who acknowledged the 'perilous state of the Earth' and a principal cause: 'nothing could be more important than helping the world's people control their numbers.' (UNEP 2002: xiv). Despite attempts by some countries to lessen growth, the global population is unlikely to stabilize below about nine billion, 50 per cent greater than now (UNFPA 2001).

Such collapses have devastated civilizations in the past (Diamond 1994) and some are occurring today. Examples include the devastation of the Aral Sea, the failure of some fisheries, mass bleaching of coral reefs, salinization and acidification of productive lands, eutrophication of waterways, and damaging irruptions of exotic species (Hutchings 2000; Mack et al. 2000; Scheffer et al. 2001). These disasters have serious consequences for humans as well as natural communities: the collapse of the Canadian cod fishery in the early 1990s from overfishing left 30,000 fishermen unemployed, and decimated numerous local economies (World Resources Institute 2000); moreover, this fishery is not recovering as rapidly as commonly expected (Hutchings 2000). Even more alarming than these regional ecological collapses is the threat of global-level climate change, a process already having widespread ecological effects (Walther et al. 2002). If these ecological disasters and threats are not effectively addressed, economic and social strategies will necessarily fail because human economies and societies are totally dependent on ecosystems. At base, all animal life depends on plant photosynthesis; this fact has been ignored by previous and current socio-economic strategies that place priority on growth rather than on sustainability. Instead, the priority strategy should be to maintain ecosystems in a sufficiently healthy state to provide life-supporting goods and services for all people. In essence, sustainability requires three conditions to be met. First, renewable resources such as timber and fish must be used at rates not exceeding the rates of regeneration. Secondly, non-renewable resources (e.g. oil, metals) must be used at rates not exceeding the rate of finding renewable substitutes; thirdly, the disposal of wastes must not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment. Failure to meet these conditions causes the loss of ecological capital and life-support capacity, this being the current and accelerating situation. This unsatisfactory state may seem surprising because the requirement for ecologically sustainable development has been recognized globally (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987) and by numerous national governments. Australia set the goal of 'development that improves the total quality of life, both now and in the future, in a way that maintains the ecological processes on which life depends' (Council of Australian Governments 1992: 6). This goal and its core objectives espousing human well-being, equity and the protection of biodiversity are unquestioned; everyone appears to endorse them. But the existing strategies are failing to achieve the stated goal, as is clearly indicated by increasing environmental degradation (SoEAC 2001); and yet the pro-growth lobbies would increase the underlying pressures in the form of population growth and economic growth. This situation has arisen because the conflicts between ESD and growth have largely been ignored, with the priority given to growth. In particular, economic growth has been, and remains, the Holy Grail; nature has been treated as inexhaustible in that any declining resource can always be replaced by another so long as demand exists (Rees 1990). Despite logic to the contrary, limits to material economic growth have not been perceived (Daly 1991). Population size is one of several underlying factors affecting the environment; others include consumption, technology and social organization (CSIRO 1994). Despite contrary opinion (e.g. Bone 2000), population size is important because it is a multiplier: total impact equals per capita impact times the number of people. Per capita impact is measured by the ecological 'footprint', this being the area needed to meet all needs (Wackernagel and Rees 1996). The average Australian footprint is about eight hectares, which is unsustainably large given the current population size (about 20 million) and ecological decline. The threat that population growth poses to ESD in Australia is considered by growth advocates to be a problem for the planet rather than for Australia. Although no targets for global population size have been set, the United Nations clearly considers population growth to be a priority problem for both human societies and ecosystems (UNFPA 2001); the most populous country, China, is actively trying to stabilize its numbers. In contrast, Australia has encouraged growth through migration. Indeed, the migration intake has recently been increased and the population growth rate is 1.3 per cent (ABS 2003), giving a theoretical doubling time of 54 years; yet Australia still has no official population policy despite the recommendations of government inquiries (Cocks 1996). This policy vacuum has encouraged various lobbyists to espouse population targets ranging from large increases, generally preferred by business interests, to rapid stabilization or even decreases, preferred by biological scientists and community organizations (Cocks 1996). Recently, three population scenarios were evaluated by the CSIRO in terms of the physical transactions supporting the Australian economy (Foran and Poldy 2002). In this study, all three scenarios (20, 25 and 32 million by 2050) were considered to be physically feasible although their social, economic and ecological costs and benefits would vary. For example, while GNP would rise in the population-increase scenarios, these would also impose serious resource, energy and ecological problems, a more moderate lifestyle, and reduced quality of life for urban dwellers. Once again there is a policy conflict between the economy and the environment and, given the recent increase in the Australian overseas migration intake (ABS 2003), it seems that once again the economy rules. Given continuing ecological decline and the political consensus for sustainability (Council of Australian Governments 1992), the onus is clearly on the growth advocates to argue their case. It appears folly to espouse population growth for Australia unless there are significant socio-economic reasons that compensate for ecological degradation. The reasons given include enhanced economic well-being, national security and international influence. While these arguments may once have been valid, they were rejected by Cocks (1996) because the economic benefits per capita are marginal at best and none of the three defence White Papers since 1976 has recommended a larger population as a basis for increased security. Further, Cocks (1996: 309) concluded that 'population growth is having and will continue to have severe adverse consequences on the quality of life of most present and future Australians'. Similarly, Yencken and Porter (2001) found that many Australians are adversely affected by the kinds of growth that fail to enhance employment, culture or democracy but that benefit the rich and despoil the environment. Growth advocates often claim that it is not numbers of people but what people do that is the problem (e.g. Bone 2000): if people reduced their consumption and applied green technologies, sustainability might be achieved, even with more people. Unfortunately, consumption is rising sharply rather than falling (SoEAC 1996, 2001) and green technology, while desirable, faces a huge challenge. Trainer (1998) estimated that a three per cent per year increase in global economic output would mean an eightfold increase by 2070 and, if all people attained Western standards of living, global output would exceed 100 times today's figure. Given that technology is failing the current sustainability challenge, it seems certain that even greatly-improved technologies, widely deployed, will be inadequate to solve the environmental problems caused by population and economic growth. In the Australian case, the claim by the Business Council of Australia for accommodating a much higher population using technological and management solutions was seriously flawed (Jones 200l). These facts call for the growth advocates to rationally argue their case against consensus goals and sustainability criteria. In doing so, they should acknowledge that there are already huge environmental remediation costs (Office of the Chief Scientist 1995; Fisher 2000), and that science does not have all the answers (Ludwig, Hilborn and Waiters 1993; Dovers and Handmer 1995). Moreover, these facts dictate the need to apply precautionary and onus principles as management strategies that emphasize the prevention of degradation or oblige developers to show that proposals will not cause unacceptable damage (Dovers and Handmer 1995). If growth advocates believe that economic growth will pay for environmental quality, a frequent claim, they should address the serious criticism by the Nobel-prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow that", "while economic growth may be associated with improvements in some environmental indicators, they imply neither that economic growth is sufficient to induce environmental improvement in         general, nor that the environmental effects of growth may be ignored, nor indeed that the Earth's resource base is capable of supporting indefinite economic growth (Arrow et al. 1995: 520).", "It thus seems that the sustained quality survival of human populations will not be achieved by economic growth despite the many benefits and advances of recent history; unfortunately these advances have been accompanied by the unsustainable consumption of ecological capital. Much more effective would be the development of population and other policies that accord with the principles of ecological sustainability. In particular, it is crucial to avoid the catastrophic situation where overpopulation erodes Earth's carrying capacity leading to a steep uncontrolled increase in the death rate (Meadows et al. 1992). Unfortunately, such erosion may already be in train. Certainly the carrying capacity of both Earth and Australia is falling because of land and water degradation and biodiversity loss. At issue is whether environmental pressures can be reduced such that a steady-state relationship between population and life support can be reached."], "id": "325e0866f96f4a4de746b0c7459da766f4c73fc86cb4aa26c11762e854bac11b", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 18, 26], [3, 153, 354], [3, 379, 435], [3, 451, 715], [3, 1318, 1517], [3, 1528, 1575], [3, 1575, 1576], [3, 7971, 8007], [3, 8008, 8099], [3, 8117, 8213], [5, 23, 275], [5, 276, 334], [5, 345, 415], [5, 416, 547], [5, 548, 593], [5, 632, 668], [5, 680, 704], [5, 710, 715], [5, 730, 949]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 7]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2003-11-01"}, {"tag": "Acting now is key to preventing Global collapse and environmental Catastrophe", "cite": "Hardin, 2004- Professor of Human Ecology at UC Santa Barbara, founder of human ecology (Garrett, One with Nineveh, p333)", "body": ["Unfortunately we're long past the era when incremental changes can save the day; our natural and technological environments are changing too rapidly so.

Large populations lead to shrinking water supplies and cropland scarcity. The UN has predicted that world population will grow by 3 billion people over the next 50 years, with 2 billion of that growth occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, regions where resources are rapidly depleting, and political instability mounting. Some experts, such as Vaclav Smil, have put the benchmark for severe cropland scarcity at .07 hectares of available cropland per capita. According to the IMF, countries with less than 1,000 cubic meters of renewable fresh water per person are suffering from acute water scarcity. Worldwide, more than 30 countries are below one of these two benchmarks, and four countries, Egypt, Israel, Kuwait and Oman, all in the volatile Middle East, are below both benchmarks. These countries also have population growth rates above the developing country average of 1.5 percent. Rapid population growth is not the sole cause of resource scarcity, but it has certainly contributed to water shortages, deforestation, cropland scarcity and food shortages. The countries that suffer most from shortages in food, water, and farmland are those with excessively high population growth rates, very large youth bulges, rapid urbanization and abject poverty. One of the most devastating consequences of rapid population growth in development countries is resource scarcity, which can breed political instability and global insecurity.  Water Shortages  Human life depends on water. Its scarcity poses a serious problem for sustaining the lives and livelihood of people throughout the developing world. Currently, about 1.7 billion people, a third of the developing world\u2019s population, live in countries with severe water stress.  According to the Worldwatch Institute\u2019s State of the World report, there are nearly 30 countries worldwide that are at the crisis level of 1,000 cubic meters of renewable fresh water per person. In Saudi Arabia, for example, only 78 cubic meters of freshwater are available per person. According to the Population Reference Bureau, only 37percent of the Haitian population had access to safe water between 1990 and 1997. U.S. residents, by contrast, have access to over 10,000 cubic meters of renewable freshwater per person.  The threat of \u201cresource wars\u201d over water is very real. Water scarcity results from population growth within countries and regions. Conflict results from competition for small quantities of water. Conflict can occur between countries over water sources, such as rivers, or within countries over water sources such as wells. Water riots occur with some regularity in India and China, the world\u2019s two most populous countries.  In particular, the State of the World Report cites a conflict over India\u2019s Cauvery River, which arose between the downstream state of Tamil Nadu and the upstream state of Karnataka. Each state wanted to use the river for different irrigation projects, and when no agreement could be reached, violence along the river ensued.  Today, there are 263 international water basins, with territory in 145 nations falling within basins. Some basins are shared by a number of countries, including the Danube, which is shared by 17 countries, and the Nile, shared by 10countries. As the population of countries sharing water sources grow, water shortages will become inevitable.  The risk of water wars appears to be greatest in the volatile and dry Middle East, where population growth rates are highest, resources are scarce, and governments are unstable.  In addition to conflicts over access to water sources, water scarcity can create tensions over an inequitable distribution of water by public services. Such conflicts generally occur between communities and governments, as was the case in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba in 2000. In 2000, the Bolivian government privatized water services. Cochabamba was plagued by water scarcity and subsequent shortages due to poor supply management. As prices rose, but service remained poor, protests sprang up first in the city and then throughout the country. The government eventually declared martial law, and violence erupted, leaving hundreds injured. Finally, the contract was canceled, but the extent of Bolivia\u2019s water scarcity has not dissipated. Bolivia\u2019s fertility rate is currently 3.8 children per women and its population is growing at 1.9 percent annually, rates well above those in the developed world. The violence in Bolivia was a direct result of price increases and poor management, but at the core it was a water shortage, fueled by rapid urbanization and population growth, that led to frustration and tension. As water becomes scarce in developing countries, already poor communities struggle for their very survival and livelihood, fueling enormous tensions between groups competing for access to limited quantities of water. Most countries suffering from water shortages are already poor, often with relatively unstable governments, creating conditions favorable to the quick escalation of conflict from localized riots to large-scale civil unrest. Water scarcity poses the greatest threat to security in countries and regions suffering from political instability and underdevelopment.  Food Insecurity and Cropland Scarcity  One of the gravest world challenges is meeting the growing need for food. While Malthusian predictions of widespread famines have not developed, food and cropland scarcity are serious problems in the developing world. Rapid population growth in the world\u2019s poorest countries has reduced cropland availability to crisis levels in many of them. While there is plenty of food available to meet the need of the world\u2019s population, in the developing world, population and environmental trends have led to severe harvest and cropland shortages. There are many causes of food insecurity. For the past few decades, the world has depended on a handful of countries\u2014the U.S., Australia, Canada and Argentina\u2014for most grain exports. However, these countries have recently begun to cut back on exports, leaving developing countries in a relative state of crisis. The Earth Policy Institute points out that world population growth has cut grainland per person in half from .23 hectares in 1950 to .11 in 2000. This drastic reduction in available grainland makes subsistence farming very difficult. Reduction in grainland due to soil erosion and poor irrigation results in desertification, which has become a serious problem in Mexico, Nigeria, Algeria, Iran, Kazakhstan, India and China, all countries that are important in terms of global security. In developing countries such as these, shortages of land threaten not only farmers\u2019 livelihood but also the ability of nations to feed their population, opening up the risk of famine. Massive food shortages and growing hunger also increase the risk of political instability and civil unrest. As populations grow, the need for food grows as well. China\u2019s consumption, for example, is expected to grow to 50 million tons of grain per year, an amount that, according to agriculture expert Lester Brown, will quickly overwhelm existing grain markets. This mounting problem will affect the entire world, particularly the United States, as China will look to compete with Americans for U.S. grains. Increases in consumption by countries such as China will also mean that smaller, developing countries will not be able to import enough grain to feed their populations. These conditions have the potential to create unrest and political instability throughout the developing world, as well as to exert pressure on the world economy. With rises in consumption, conflict can break out within countries over resources, and between countries over imports and exports. Even when cropland is not so scarce as to precipitate famine, cropland scarcity makes earning a living increasingly difficult for farmers. As a result, cropland disputes are increasingly common in resource-scarce countries and regions as farmers struggle economically. One of the best-known conflicts over land is the Zapatista rebellion that took place in the Chiapas region of southern Mexico in the 1990s. The conflict was the result of already existing tension between powerful landowners and landless Mayan peasants, exacerbated by cropland scarcity. Cropland scarcity in Chiapas in the years preceding the conflict was caused primarily by deforestation and soil erosion. While soil erosion in Chiapas was generally caused by environmental factors, including lack of rainfall, deforestation was directly related to population growth. Thomas Homer Dixon of the University of Toronto puts population growth in Chiapas at 3.6 percent between 1970 to 1996 and maintains that the population growth rate for the Mayan population during this period was as high as 54.6 percent. In addition, migration from Guatemala added another 300,000 residents to Chiapas from 1983 to 1986. As the population of Chiapas grew, available cropland decreased and deforestation resulted. Only 3.7 percent of deforested land was used for agriculture, leading to severe cropland scarcity that placed severe stress on the already struggling Mayan peasants. The proportion of land occupied by the wealthy landowners grew, while the land available to peasants shrank, making earning a living nearly impossible. Tensions continued to escalate between the two groups. While the Mayan peasants did not start the uprising, the Zapatistas used the tension between the peasants and the landowners to rally peasants to their side, promising a more equitable distribution of scarce land if the Zapatistas won their rebellion. The case of Chiapas makes clear the connection between population growth and cropland scarcity and conflict. The Chiapas conflict was, and is, one of the main forces for instability in Mexico, a country whose security and stability is extremely important to the United States. The Zapatista rebellion is not the only example of a conflict fueled by population growth and resource scarcity. Many experts contend that the devastating genocide in 1990 Rwanda was caused partly by demographic factors. Rwanda and its neighbor Burundi suffer from some of the highest population growth rates in the world. Jared Diamond, UCLA Geography professor and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, argues that the conflict in the Kanama region in northwestern Rwanda was caused almost entirely by farmland scarcity resulting from rapid population growth, as the region was inhabited only by Hutus yet experienced high rates of violence. In this region, the average number of people per farm household increased rapidly when young people could not find land outside their family property, creating farm plots so small that it was virtually impossible to reap meaningful harvests. The economic consequences of attempting to split land between many heirs can be felt throughout the developing world. In Rwanda, tensions arose between wealthy large landowners and subsistence farmers. Land disputes caused serious conflicts that severed family ties, and turned close relatives into competitors and bitter enemies.  The region experienced rising levels of violence and theft, perpetrated namely by hungry landless young people without off-farm income.  Diamond asserts that crime rates in all of Rwanda correlated statistically with population density and per-capita availability of calories: high population densities and worse starvation were directly associated with increased crime.

Population growth brings with it a steady shrinkage of life-supporting resources per person. That decline, which is threatening to drop the living standards of more and more people below survival level, could lead to unmanageable social tensions that will translate into broadbased conflicts. Worldwide, the area in grain expanded from 590 million hectares (1,457 million acres) in 1950 to its historical peak of 730 million hectares in 1981. By 2004, it had fallen to 670 million hectares. Even as the world\u2019s population continues to grow, the area available for producing grain is shrinking.11 Expanding world population cut the grainland area per person in half, from 0.23 hectares (0.57 acres) in 1950 to 0.11 hectares in 2000. (See Figure 2\u20131.) This area of just over one tenth of a hectare per person is half the size of a building lot in an affluent U.S. suburb. This halving of grainland area per person makes it more difficult for the world\u2019s farmers to feed the 70 million or more people added each year. If current population projections materialize and if the overall grainland area remains constant, the area per person will shrink to 0.07 hectares in 2050, less than two thirds that in 2000.12 Having less cropland per person not only threatens livelihoods; in largely subsistence societies with nutrientdepleted soils, it threatens survival itself. Tensions among people begin to build as land holdings shrink below that needed for survival. The Sahelian zone of Africa, the broad swatch of the continent between the Sahara Desert and the more lush forested land to the south, which stretches from Sudan in the east through Mauritania in the west, has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations. It is also an area of spreading conflicts.13 In troubled Sudan, 2 million people have died in the long-standing conflict between the Muslim north and the Christian south. The conflict in the Darfur region in western Sudan in 2004 illustrates the mounting tensions between two Muslim groups\u2014Arab camel herders and black African subsistence farmers. Government troops are backing Arab militias, who are engaging in the wholesale slaughter of black Africans in an effort to drive them off their land, sending them into refugee camps in Chad.14 In Nigeria, where 130 million people are crammed into an area not much larger than Texas, overgrazing and overplowing are converting 351,000 hectares (1,350 square miles) of grassland and cropland into desert each year. The conflict between farmers and herders in Nigeria is a war for survival. As the New York Times reported in June 2004, \u201cin recent years, as the desert has spread, trees have been felled and the populations of both herders and farmers have soared, the competition for land has only intensified.\u201d15 Unfortunately, the division between herders and farmers is also often the division between Muslims and Christians. This competition for land, amplified by religious differences and combined with a large number of frustrated young men with guns, has created what the New York Times describes as a \u201ccombustible mix\u201d that has \u201cfueled a recent orgy of violence across this fertile central Nigerian state [Kebbi]. Churches and mosques were razed. Neighbor turned against neighbor. Reprisal attacks spread until finally, in mid-May, the government imposed emergency rule.\u201d16 Similar divisions exist between herders and farmers in northern Mali, the Times noted, where \u201cswords and sticks have been chucked for Kalashnikovs, as desertification and population growth have stiffened the competition between the largely black African farmers and the ethnic Tuareg and Fulani herders. Tempers are raw on both sides. The dispute, after all, is over livelihood and even more, about a way of life.\u201d17 Water, too, is a source of growing tension. Although much has been said about the conflicts between and among countries over water resources, some of the most bitter disagreements are taking place within countries where needs of local populations are outrunning the sustainable yield of wells.

When fertilizer prices go up, the farmers take a hit; when commodity prices go up, the processors take a hit; when fuel prices go up, everyone takes a hit (except, perhaps, ethanol). But underneath the industry's dozens of competing interests is one overarching theme--trade--and a question: Which presidential candidate best helps their interests? Long something of an afterthought, an over-subsidized laggard during the infotech boom, agriculture is now a burgeoning bright spot in a largely troubled economy. While government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae (nyse: FNM - news - people ) and Freddie Mac (nyse: FRE - news - people ) are teetering on the edge of nationalization, the Farm Credit System, a forgotten government-sponsored enterprise, is buzzing along. Gone are the days where debt from Fannie and Freddie was second only to U.S. Treasuries.

Improvements in seeds and farming practices allowed corn yields to double in 15 years. As crops get more bug-resistant and drought-resistant and can grow in more tightly planted rows, that number could double again in the next couple of decades. In the past, there's been little incentive to develop this new lab-grown abundance. Demand in the U.S. grows mostly in step with the population, which hardly grows at all.

Water stress is spreading as populations increase [see map]. By 2015, nearly 3 billion people\u201440 percent of the projected world population-are expected to live in countries that find it difficult or impossible to mobilize enough water to satisfy the food, industrial, and domestic needs of their citizens. This scarcity will translate into heightened competition for water between cities and farms, between neighboring states and provinces, and at times between nations.  The largest and most combustible imbalance between population and available water supplies will be in Asia, where crop production depends heavily on irrigation. Asia today has roughly 60 percent of the world's people but only 36 percent of the world's renewable fresh water. China, India, Iran, and Pakistan are among the countries where a significant share of the irrigated land is now jeopardized by groundwater depletion, scarce river water, a fertility-sapping buildup of salts in the soil, or some combination of these factors. Groundwater depletion alone places 10 to 20 percent of grain production in both China and India at risk. Water tables are falling steadily in the North China Plain, which yields more than half of China's wheat and nearly one third of its corn, as well as in northwest India's Punjab, another major breadbasket.  As farmers lose access to irrigation water and see their livelihoods deteriorate, they may not only resort to violent protest but migrate across borders and to restive and already overcrowded cities. Such has been the case in Pakistan, where falling agricultural output has prompted a massive rural migration to large urban centers, leading to renewed outbreaks of ethnic violence.  Internal water stresses will also shift international political alliances and add to the burden of humanitarian crises. Countries commonly adapt to water stress by importing more of their food, provided they have the foreign exchange to do so. It takes about 1,000 cubic meters of water to grow one ton of grain. By importing wheat and other staples, water-stressed countries can allocate more of their scarce fresh water to cities and industries, which generate far more economic value per liter than agriculture does. Israel, for example, has done very nicely with this approach. Currently water-stressed countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East account for 26 percent of global grain imports. As an additional billion people are added to water-stressed countries over the next 15 years and as more countries join the ranks of food importers, demand for international grain will increase. A good portion of that increase may come from China, India, and Pakistan-all currently grain self-sufficient, but unlikely to remain so for reasons of water and land scarcity. Their governments will inevitably form stronger alliances with the nations from which they choose to import food. For those nations without sufficient foreign exchange to turn to imports, notably those in sub-Saharan Africa, higher world grain prices will likely mean greater hunger and more calls for humanitarian aid. Finally, a new cause of water-related tensions has surfaced in just the last few years\u2014the transfer of water system ownership and/or management from public authorities to private multinational corporations. Driving privatization is a confluence of forces: the mounting costs and political liabilities of providing urban water services, increased pressure on governments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to reduce water subsidies and public-sector debt, and the growing power of private corporations seeking to profit from the sale of water and related services. Especially where privatization takes place in the presence of poverty and inequality, which is to say in most of the developing world, it can lead to civil protest and violence.  Recent events in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, underscore these risks. Following the privatization of Cochabamba's water system, which had been plagued by corruption and mismanagement, water rates skyrocketed\u2014resulting in water bills for some residents equal to a quarter or more of their income. Months of civil unrest culminated in April 2000, when the La Paz government sent soldiers into Cochabamba, where some 30,000 protesters had amassed in the central plaza. Several days of violence ensued, leaving one person dead and more than a hundred injured. The conflict abated only when the water system returned to public control.  Cochabamba is an extreme but not isolated case. Activists in Colombia and South Africa likewise have opposed the privatization of water and other municipal services. Meanwhile, IMF loan agreements with at least half a dozen countries last year called for some degree of water system privatization. The number of urban dwellers worldwide is projected to nearly double\u2014to 5 billion\u2014by 2025. Unless governments and lenders strengthen municipal water agencies and steer private-sector involvement toward equity as well as efficiency and toward social justice as well as shareholder profit, more violence like that in Cochabamba may be forthcoming.

The plain fact is - no water, no life! This becomes all the more worrying when we realize that the world\u2019s supply of drinkable water will soon diminish quite rapidly. In fact a recent report commissioned by the United Nations has emphasized that by the year 2025 at least 66% of the worlds population will be without an adequate water supply. As a disaster in the making water shortage ranks in the top category. Without water we are finished, and it is thus imperative that we protect the mechanism through which we derive our supply of this life giving fluid. Unfortunately the exact opposite is the case. We are doing incalculable damage to the planets capacity to generate water and this will have far ranging consequences for the not too distant future. The United Nations has warned that burning of fossil fuels is the prime cause of water shortage. While there may be other reasons such as increased solar activity it is clear that this is a situation over which we can exert a great deal of control. If not then the future will be very bleak indeed! Already the warning signs are there. The last year has seen devastating heatwaves in many parts of the world including the USA where the state of Texas experienced its worst drought on record. Elsewhere in the United States forest fires raged out of control, while other regions of the globe experienced drought conditions that were even more severe. Parts of Iran, Afgahnistan, China and other neighbouring countries experienced their worst droughts on record. These conditions also extended throughout many parts of Africa and it is clear that if circumstances remain unchanged we are facing a disaster of epic proportions. Moreover it will be one for which there is no easy answer. The spectre of a world water shortage evokes a truly frightening scenario. In fact the United Nations warns that disputes over water will become the prime source of conflict in the not too distant future. Where these shortages become ever more acute it could forseeably lead to the brink  of nuclear conflict. On a lesser scale water, and the price of it, will acquire an importance somewhat like the current value placed on oil. The difference of course is that while oil is not vital for life, water most certainly is! It seems clear then that in future years countries rich in water will enjoy an importance that perhaps they do not have today. In these circumstances power shifts are inevitable, and this will undoubtedly create its own strife and tension. In the long term the implications do not look encouraging. It is a two edged sword. First the shortage of water, and then the increased stresses this will impose upon an already stressed world of politics. It means that answers need to be found immediately.

Since the earth\u2019s  creation, an essentially fixed amount  of carbon has flowed continuously  between the earth\u2019s atmosphere,  oceans, and crust. This global carbon cycle is one of the planet\u2019s major bio-geochemical processes and helps reg-ulate the atmospheric concentration  of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most  important greenhouse gas driving  human-induced climate change.  On the earth\u2019s surface, plants, soils,  and microorganisms are natural sinks,  or storage reservoirs, for carbon.  Approximately 830 billion metric tons  of carbon are stored in the world\u2019s  forests, about the same amount of  carbon as the atmosphere holds in  the form of carbon dioxide. Roughly  40 percent of this carbon\u2014330 billion  tons\u2014is contained in trees, plants  and other forest vegetation, with the  remainder contained in forest soils  and roots.20  Holding so much carbon, forests can  either be a net source or a net sink  for the carbon in atmospheric CO2.  Today, they mostly act as a source.  Tropical deforestation and forest  degradation account for roughly one-  fourth of all the CO2 emissions that  result from human activity.21At the  same time, forests and soils in the  Northern Hemisphere appear, on bal-ance, to be absorbing carbon, but  there is no way to know if or how long  this will continue.22 Future accelera-tion in the loss of tropical forests  could lead to significant additional  emissions of CO2, further hampering  international efforts to combat  global warming. Programs that slow and eventually  reverse the global loss of forests could  make a major contribution towards  balancing the global carbon budget.  A 1996 report commissioned by the  UN Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-mate Change concluded that the  world\u2019s forests could store up to 87  billion tons of carbon between 1995  and 2050, an amount representing  more than 12 percent of cumulative  fossil fuel emissions over the same  period. This additional carbon storage,  however, would need to come from a  reversal of tropical deforestation,23 a  feat that will depend very much on  future population trends not only in  the tropics but elsewhere.

Demand has exceeded the sustainable yield of natural systems at the local level countless times in the past. Now, for the first time, it is doing so at the global level. Forests are shrinking for the world as a whole. Fishery collapses are widespread. Grasslands are deteriorating on every continent. Water tables are falling in many countries. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions exceed CO2 fixation everywhere. In 2002, a team of scientists led by Mathis Wackernagel, who now heads the Global Footprint Network, concluded that humanity\u2019s collective demands first surpassed the earth\u2019s regenerative capacity around 1980. Their study, published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, estimated that global demands in 1999 exceeded that capacity by 20 percent. The gap, growing by 1 percent or so a year, is now much wider. We are meeting current demands by consuming the earth\u2019s natural assets, setting the stage for decline and collapse.2 In a rather ingenious approach to calculating the human physical presence on the planet, Paul MacCready, the founder and Chairman of AeroVironment and designer of the first solar-powered aircraft, has calculated the weight of all vertebrates on the land and in the air. He notes that when agriculture began, humans, their livestock, and pets together accounted for less than 0.1 percent of the total. Today, he estimates, this group accounts for 98 percent of the earth\u2019s total vertebrate biomass, leaving only 2 percent for the wild portion, the latter including all the deer, wildebeests, elephants, great cats, birds, small mammals, and so forth.3 Ecologists are intimately familiar with the overshoot-andcollapse phenomenon. One of their favorite examples began in 1944, when the Coast Guard introduced 29 reindeer on remote St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea to serve as the backup food source for the 19 men operating a station there. After World War II ended a year later, the base was closed and the men left the island. When U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist David Kline visited St. Matthew in 1957, he discovered a thriving population of 1,350 reindeer feeding on the four-inch-thick mat of lichen that covered the 332-square-kilometer (128-square-mile) island. In the absence of any predators, the population was exploding. By 1963, it had reached 6,000. He returned to St. Matthew in 1966 and discovered an island strewn with reindeer skeletons and not much lichen. Only 42 of the reindeer survived: 41 females and 1 not entirely healthy male. There were no fawns. By 1980 or so, the remaining reindeer had died off.4 Like the deer on St. Matthew Island, we too are overconsuming our natural resources. Overshoot leads sometimes to decline and sometimes to a complete collapse. It is not always clear which it will be. In the former, a remnant of the population or economic activity survives in a resource-depleted environment. For example, as the environmental resource base of Easter Island in the South Pacific deteriorated, its population declined from a peak of 20,000 several centuries ago to today\u2019s population of fewer than 4,000. In contrast, the 500-year-old Norse settlement in Greenland collapsed during the 1400s, disappearing entirely in the face of environmental adversity.5 As of 2005, some 42 countries have populations that are stable or declining slightly in size as a result of falling birth rates. But now for the first time ever, demographers are projecting population declines in some countries because of rising death rates, among them Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. In the absence of an accelerated shift to smaller families, this list of countries is likely to grow much longer in the years immediately ahead.6 ", "the years immediately ahead.6 The most recent mid-level U.N. demographic projections show world population increasing from 6.1 billion in 2000 to 9.1 billion in 2050. But such an increase seems highly unlikely, considering the deterioration in life-support systems now under way in much of the world. Will we not reach 9.1 billion because we quickly eradicate global poverty and lower birth rates? Or because we fail to do so and death rates begin to rise, as they are already doing in many African countries? We thus face two urgent major challenges: restructuring the global economy and stabilizing world population.7 Even as the economy\u2019s environmental support systems are deteriorating, the world is pumping oil with reckless abandon. Leading geologists now think oil production may soon peak and turn downward. This collision between the ever-growing demand for oil and the earth\u2019s finite resources is but the latest in a long series of collisions. Although no one knows exactly when oil production will peak, supply is already lagging behind demand, driving prices upward.8 In this new world, the price of oil begins to set the price of food, not so much because of rising fuel costs for farmers and food processors but more because almost everything we eat can be converted into fuel for cars. In this new world of high oil prices, supermarkets and service stations will compete in commodity markets for basic food commodities such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and sugarcane. Wheat going into the market can be converted into bread for supermarkets or ethanol for service stations. Soybean oil can go onto supermarket shelves or it can go to service stations to be used as diesel fuel. In effect, owners of the world\u2019s 800 million cars will be competing for food resources with the 1.2 billion people living on less than $1 a day.9 Faced with a seemingly insatiable demand for automotive fuel, farmers will want to clear more and more of the remaining tropical forests to produce sugarcane, oil palms, and other highyielding fuel crops. Already, billions of dollars of private capital are moving into this effort. In effect, the rising price of oil is generating a massive new threat to the earth\u2019s biological diversity. As the demand for farm commodities climbs, it is shifting the focus of international trade concerns from the traditional goal of assured access to markets to one of assured access to supplies. Countries heavily dependent on imported grain for food are beginning to worry that buyers for fuel distilleries may outbid them for supplies. As oil security deteriorates, so, too, will food security. As the role of oil recedes, the process of globalization will be reversed in fundamental ways. As the world turned to oil during the last century, the energy economy became increasingly globalized, with the world depending heavily on a handful of countries in the Middle East for energy supplies. Now as the world turns to wind, solar cells, and geothermal energy in this century, we are witnessing the localization of the world energy economy. The globalization of the world food economy will also be reversed, as the higher price of oil raises the cost of transporting food internationally. In response, food production and consumption will become much more localized, leading to diets based more on locally produced food and seasonal availability. The world is facing the emergence of a geopolitics of scarcity, which is already highly visible in the efforts by China, India, and other developing countries to ensure their access to oil supplies. In the future, the issue will be who gets access to not only Middle Eastern oil but also Brazilian ethanol and North American grain. Pressures on land and water resources, already excessive in most of the world, will intensify further as the demand for biofuels climbs. This geopolitics of scarcity is an early manifestation of civilization in an overshoot-and-collapse mode, much like the one that emerged among the Mayan cities competing for food in that civilization\u2019s waning years.10 You do not need to be an ecologist to see that if recent environmental trends continue, the global economy eventually will come crashing down. It is not knowledge that we lack. At issue is whether national governments can stabilize population and restructure the economy before time runs out. Looking at what is happening in China helps us to see the urgency of acting quickly.

Outgrowing the Earth: The Food Security Challenge in an Age of Falling Water Tables and Rising Temperatures, ]", "body": ["", "Growth: The Environmental Fallout The world economy, as now structured, is making excessive demands on the earth. Evidence of this can be seen in collapsing fisheries, shrinking forests, expanding deserts, rising CO2 levels, eroding soils, rising temperatures, falling water tables, melting glaciers, deteriorating grasslands, rising seas, rivers that are running dry, and disappearing species. Nearly all these environmentally destructive trends adversely affect the world food prospect. For example, even a modest rise of 1 degree Fahrenheit in temperature in mountainous regions can substantially increase rainfall and decrease snowfall. The result is more flooding during the rainy season and less snowmelt to feed rivers during the dry season, when farmers need irrigation water.15 Or consider the collapse of fisheries and the associated leveling off of the oceanic fish catch. During the last half-century the fivefold growth in the world fish catch that satisfied much of the growing demand for animal protein pushed oceanic fisheries to their limits and beyond. Now, in this new century, we cannot expect any growth at all in the catch. All future growth in animal protein supplies can only come from the land, putting even more pressure on the earth\u2019s land and water resources.16 Farmers have long had to cope with the cumulative effects of soil erosion on land productivity, the loss of cropland to nonfarm uses, and the encroachment of deserts on cropland. Now they are also being battered by higher temperatures and crop-scorching heat waves. Likewise, farmers who once had assured supplies of irrigation water are now forced to abandon irrigation as aquifers are depleted and wells go dry. Collectively this array of environmental trends is making it even more difficult for farmers to feed adequately the 70 million people added to our ranks each year.17 Until recently, the economic effects of environmental trends, such as overfishing, overpumping, and overplowing, were largely local. Among the many examples are the collapse of the cod fishery off Newfoundland from overfishing that cost Canada 40,000 jobs, the halving of Saudi Arabia\u2019s wheat harvest as a result of aquifer depletion, and the shrinking grain harvest of Kazakhstan as wind erosion claimed half of its cropland.  Now, if world food supplies tighten, we may see the first global economic effect of environmentally destructive trends. Rising food prices could be the first economic indicator to signal serious trouble in the deteriorating relationship between the global economy and the earth\u2019s ecosystem. The short-lived 20-percent rise in world grain prices in early 2004 may turn out to be a warning tremor before the quake.19  "], "id": "e8fb323d8573dd08f2ef7ba928eb5f59607567bd0432fd528759175fa2e41ca7", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 34, 51], [3, 72, 112], [3, 146, 393], [3, 402, 487], [3, 1097, 1131], [3, 1146, 1286], [3, 1566, 1702], [3, 2303, 2416], [3, 2418, 2455], [3, 2465, 2587]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2005-01-01"}, {"tag": "", "cite": "Otten \u2013Professor of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics \u2013 2001 (Edward, \u201cThe Effect of Human Population on Biodiversity,\u201d Human Population Impacts on Biodiversity, )", "body": ["", "Most of the scientific evidence collected since Malthus has supported his theory that even the most slow growing species would cover the earth in a short time if its population growth were unrestrained.

The Ugandan population currently stands at around 27 million. With an average Ugandan woman producing seven children and an annual growth rate of over 3 %, the population will almost double by 2025. This trend makes Uganda one of the fastest growing countries in the world in terms of population. Statistics show that the population density of Uganda is around 105 per square Km compared to 53 for Kenya, 39 for Tanzania, 29 for Zimbabwe, 13 Zambia and 24 for Mozambique. What should we make of this trend? My thinking is that the current population trends constitute the biggest threat to Uganda's sustained economic growth. Statistics indicate that over 80 percent of Ugandan's derive their livelihoods directly from land through farming and indirectly through agro-based businesses. This is the reason why the Government of Uganda has identified agriculture as the stepping stone for reducing poverty as spelt out in Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). Whereas the PEAP provides a good framework for fighting poverty, the current population growth rate represents a major threat to the availability of arable land, the key resource at the heart of the campaign against poverty. According to the State of the Environment Report of 2000, the per capita arable land decreased from 5.2 hectares in 1931 to 0.8 hectares in 2000 and is expected to fall to 0.6 hectares by 2015. This means that landlessness is on the increase which is resulting into the massive encroachment on forests we are seeing today. If the situation is not controlled, the future threat to forests like Mabira will not be the industrialists like Mehta, but rather a possible uprising of the desperate landless and jobless Ugandans with nothing else to survive on but land. Whereas we may win the battle against Mehta, it would be difficult to control such encroachers like was the case in Mayuge District. We have seen similar forceful encroachment of National Parks like Queen Elizabeth by landless livestock keepers. The land wrangles in Kibaale District also signal the dire consequences of increasing pressure on land. The implication of this trend is that we are not only loosing the battle against poverty due to uncontrolled population growth, but we are also degrading the environment. In other words, it will be very difficult to protect the environment in Uganda as the population grows with no jobs being created as an alternative source of livelihood. What is the solution then?

Even if nations' policy changes reduce the birth rate to an average of 2 children per couple, the 12 billion mark would be reached in 70 years. o Because more than 99.8 percent of human food comes from the land, doubling the planet's population will further stress resources for fresh water, renewable and fossil energy, fertilizers and pesticides.

This comes at a time when food production should be increasing dramatically to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population. Pimentel noted that per-capita cropland has declined 20 percent worldwide in the past decade. \"The only way to reverse the growing imbalance between human population numbers and food supply is to actively conserve cropland, fresh water, energy and other environmental resources,\" Pimentel said. \"We must focus on developing appropriate, ecologically safe agricultural technologies for increasing food production.

Between 1971 and 1986, arable land expanded by 59 million hectares, while forests shrank by at least 125 million hectares. However, consultant Harrison estimates that during the same period, land used for settlements, roads, industries, office buildings and other development expanded by more than 50 million hectares as a result of growth in urban centers, reducing the amount of arable land in surrounding areas. Consequently, the amount of natural habitat wiped out to produce the 59-million-hectare net in arable land may have exceeded 100 million hectares.

Of the 76 countries that presently encompass tropical forests, only four\u2014Brazil, Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Zaire\u2014are likely to retain major undamaged tracts by 2010, less than a generation away. Population pressure contributes to deforestation not only because of increased demand for croplandand living space but also because of increased demand for fuelwood, on which half of the world's people depend for heating and cooking. The majority of sub-Saharan Africa's population is dependent on fuelwood: 82 percent of all Nigerians, 70 percent of Kenyans, 80 percent of all Malagasies, 74 percent of Ghanaians, 93 percent of Ethiopians, 90 percent of Somalians and 81 percent of Sudanese. By 1990, 100 million Third World residents lacked sufficient fuelwood to meet minimum daily energy requirements, and close to 1.3 billion were consuming wood faster than forest growth could replenish it. On average, consumption outpaces supply by 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, by 70 percent in the Sudan and India, by 150 percent in Ethiopia and by 200 percent in Niger. If present trends continue, FAO predicts, another 1 billion people will be faced with critical fuelwood shortages by the end of the decade.

AIDS, the Ebola outbreak which killed more than 100 people in Africa last year, the flu epidemic that has now affected 200,000 in the former Soviet Union - they are all, according to Dr Ben-Abraham, the \"tip of the iceberg\". Two decades of intensive study and research in the field of virology have convinced him of one thing: in place of natural and man-made disasters or nuclear warfare, humanity could face extinction because of a single virus, deadlier than HIV. \"An airborne virus is a lively, complex and dangerous organism,\" he said. \"It can come from a rare animal or from anywhere and can mutate constantly. If there is no cure, it affects one person and then there is a chain reaction and it is unstoppable. It is a tragedy waiting to happen.\" That may sound like a far-fetched plot for a Hollywood film, but Dr Ben -Abraham said history has already proven his theory. Fifteen years ago, few could have predicted the impact of AIDS on the world. Ebola has had sporadic outbreaks over the past 20 years and the only way the deadly virus - which turns internal organs into liquid - could be contained was because it was killed before it had a chance to spread. Imagine, he says, if it was closer to home: an outbreak of that scale in London, New York or Hong Kong. It could happen anytime in the next 20 years - theoretically, it could happen tomorrow. The shock of the AIDS epidemic has prompted virus experts to admit \"that something new is indeed happening and that the threat of a deadly viral outbreak is imminent\", said Joshua Lederberg of the Rockefeller University in New York, at a recent conference. He added that the problem was \"very serious and is getting worse\". Dr Ben-Abraham said: \"Nature isn't benign. The survival of the human species is not a preordained evolutionary programme. Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn how to mutate and evade the immune system.\" He cites the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak as an example of how viruses have outsmarted human intelligence. And as new \"mega-cities\" are being developed in the Third World and rainforests are destroyed, disease-carrying animals and insects are forced into areas of human habitation. \"This raises the very real possibility that lethal, mysterious viruses would, for the first time, infect humanity at a large scale and imperil the survival of the human race,\" he said.", ""], "id": "74ffeed30d8751906413c86c2f6ebaf4f80e7301754b9c9b0d0d55db1dd069ce", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[4, 92, 116], [4, 172, 188], [4, 248, 260], [4, 291, 539], [4, 559, 621], [4, 637, 845], [4, 932, 969], [4, 969, 970], [4, 990, 1033], [4, 1046, 1047], [4, 1048, 1080], [4, 1104, 1137], [4, 1182, 1268], [4, 1279, 1303], [4, 1365, 1380], [4, 1443, 1452], [4, 1526, 1672], [4, 1710, 1776], [4, 1783, 1784], [4, 1784, 1977], [4, 2328, 2365], [4, 2387, 2473]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1996-01-01"}, {"tag": "More population risks disease spread", "cite": "Andrew T.

That is, each infected individual must infect more than one other. The exact threshold will vary according to the specific attributes of both the parasite and host populations. For example, measles was unable to endogenize itself in human populations until thresholds of 200,000 to 500,000 persons were surpassed in urban centers. Continually increasing population thresholds (and densities) in urban centers will permit the emergence and establishment of novel pathogens within the human ecology. It is equally important to note that the continuing growth of the absolute human population on this planet increases the absolute number of contacts between humans and pathogen reservoirs in the form of infected fauna. This, in turn, raises the statistical probability that zoonotic pathogens may jump the species barrier and establish themselves within the human populations. Ewald also argues that increasing population density will probably increase the lethality of infectious diseases, as increased frequency of transmission increases pathogenic lethality. Wilson is also concerned that global trends in urbanization may increase the probability of transference of pathogens between urban and rural population pools and, moreover, may permit the spread of entirely new pathogenic agents: \u201d[Megacities] will have the population density to support persistence of some infections and contribute to the emergence of others. Many of these areas are located in tropical or sub-tropical regions, where the environment can support a diverse array of pathogens and vectors. Also developing are huge periurban slums, populated with persons from many geographic origins. Poor sanitation allows breeding of anthropod vectors, rodents, and other disease-carrying animals. Crowded conditions favor the spread of diseases that pass from person to person, including sexually transmitted infections. Travel between periurban slum areas and rural areas is common, paving the route for the transfer of microbes and disease. Transfer of resistance genes and genetic recombination may also occur in and spread from crowded environments of transients.\u201d Thus, an increasing aggregate global human population, urban population, and population density will typically combine to act as disease amplifiers by promoting pathogen emergence, enhancing transmission and increasing lethality.", "", ""], "id": "20a2ab1e4b6f2a6f78db5cbca0d2217872a20e1f3128221e1296feb81ccfe313", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2001-01-01"}, {"tag": "", "cite": "Ehrlich et al 95 (Paul R., Bing Professor of Population Studies and Professor of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, Anne H.

Western intervention in the Sahel, Western science and technology, and the best intentioned efforts of donor agencies and governments over the last several decades, have in fact made a principal contribution to the destruction.\"One of the basic factors in the situation is overpopulation, both human and bovine, brought about by the application of modern science,\" says a former Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) sociologist. According to a recent in-house report on the Sahel prepared by the Agency for International Development (AID), \"To a large extent the deterioration. of the subsistence base is directly attributable to the fact that man's interventions in the delicately balanced ecological zones bordering desert areas have usually been narrowly conceived and poorly implemented.\" \"Too many of our projects have been singularly unproductive and . . . we have tediously reintroduced projects which ought never to have been attempted in the first place,\" says Michael M. Horowitz, a State University of New York anthropologist who has studied the nomad peoples of Niger. And, to quote the AID report again, \"It must be recognized that assistance agencies have ignored the principles [of effective resource management], and the consequence of indiscriminate support has produced negative results or, on occasion, disaster.\"", "cite": "\nOur disad is the most moral option \u2013 \na) You have more of a moral obligation to future generations than to current ones; future generations don\u2019t have a voice now, so we owe it to them to preserve the earth \n\nb) 10 to 1 \u2013 every life you save now kills 10 in the crunch.

A philosopher actually declared, on the grounds of an absolutistic moralism, that we should share all food on the global scale even if it means that all mankind would starve and the human species become extinct (Watson, 1977). This is a sense of obligation so undiscriminating that it takes our breath away. It is reminiscent of Cardinal Newman's grim opinion, in a religious controversy in 1870, that to prevent the commission of even one petty little sin it would be better that the whole world and all the people in it be incinerated.", "In moral philosophy the issue at stake in this discussion is not merely the age-old one of absolutism versus relativism, nor of the one (or a few) versus the many, but also whether we are able to make rational and responsible value judgments without accurate measurement -- measuring not only the factors involved and the options available, but the probable consequences of alternative courses of action.", "I have myself for a long time now insisted that not to measure, not to have the relevant numbers, is ethically slipshod and disingenuous.

By such standards we also determine whether an act or policy is right or wrong. In mathematical language we might say our values are the independent variables we use in any set of ethical equations. My own training in moral philosophy was done within the context of the humanities, and such was the case for most of my colleagues in the field. Our lack of scientific and mathematical appreciation leaves us at some loss when we have to deal, as we do increasingly in our mass society, with the measurement requirements of just distribution. We lack the requisite quantifiers or any methodology of quantification.Back in the seventeenth century such social analysts as Sir William Petty and Sir Dudley North were on much sounder ground (although they were not yet able to perceive that it was so) when they thought of themselves as engaged in political arithmetic.. In modern times legislators in democracies have as their primary goal the framing of laws which aim at the greatest good of the greatest number, and how else can they do it but by measuring the presumed consequences of their statutes on all the individuals and groups affected? How else' can they determine a just allocation of society's limited resources?

Complete egoism on the part of the parents simply does not pay, not in an evolutionary sense. The shortening of a parent's life is a trivial matter if the probability of there being children-and grandchildren and more remote descendants-is increased by the sacrifice.  In a word, and almost paradoxically, death has survival value. In a strict and narrow biological sense, the death of the individual is good if it benefits the germ line. So the paradox is only apparent.  Lest it be supposed that only altruism is selected for within the  family circle, let me cite another variation in behavior. The European Swift lays a clutch of three eggs in the early summer, the offspring of which must be fed by the parents later, gleaning insects on the wing. Not many insects fly in cold, rainy weather.the weather turns unfavorable while the eggs are being brooded the parents tip first one egg out of the nest, then two, and finally all three. The parents' action is the avian equivalent of abortion. The adaptive significance is obvious: parents who carry out such \"abortion\" will, on the average, leave more living offspring behind than will parents who unwisely-that is, unseasonably bring young into the world at a time when they cannot take care of them. Applying conventional human language to these two animal stories we would likely speak of the noble self-sacrifice of the cricket mother, and the despicable murderousness of the swifts. Bio-ethically, however, the two cases are identical: each strategy maximizes survival in the long run. Both species are, so to speak, accurate Promethean calculators: their instinctive behavior takes account of the And then what? question. As a matter of fact, species are Promethean calculators-except possibly Homo sapiens, some of the members of which suffer from the romantic delusion that we can survive as Epimetheans. Paradoxically, shortness of life can have survival value. How length of life is determined by evolutionary forces has been convincingly explained by R. A. Fisher and Peter Medawar.' Human efforts to escape the effects of natural selection often take the form of comminizing the rewards, a dangerously Epimethean strategy found in such inventions as social security systems, socialized medicine, and \"progressive\" taxation. These topics deserve, and will no doubt some day receive, a thorough study from the Promethean point of view. For the present let us pass them by. The value of death is influenced by the formative stage of the individual at the time when life is terminated.

Thus far, production has been able to keep up with the food needs of our expanding population. Fossil energy also powers our vast transportation system and industrial development. As important, its availability has improved the quality of life, protecting humans from numerous diseases. For example, many diseases are transmitted via water, and the availability of energy makes possible the purification and delivery of clean water. Fossil fuels are used in processes to remove sewage and to process wastes before they are returned to the environment. Pesticides, produced from petrochemicals, play a major role in protecting crops from pests and controlling vectors of human disease, e.g. mosquito vectors of encephalitis. Fossil energy use in all U.S. economic sectors has increased from 20 to as much as 1000-fold in just 4 decades. U.S. citizens consume 20 to 30 times more fossil energy per capita than most people in developing countries. Since 1945, energy for agricultural use has increased about 4-fold while crop yields have increased about 3-fold. Currently the 400 gallons of oil equivalents expended to feed each American amount to about 17% of all energy used in this country each year. Fossil fuels are finite, meaning their supply is subject to depletion and more importantly once gone, they can not be replenished. The estimates concerning future availability of fossil fuels are discouraging, especially for oil and gas. Government reports indicate that only 15 to 20 years of oil resources and 20 to 30 years of natural gas reserves remain, given current use levels. Note, Alaska peaked for its oil production in 1988 and oil reserves are expected to be depleted by 2015. U.S. oil production has been declining by 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per year. To augment the diminishing supply, the U.S. now imports 58% of its oil from the Middle East and other areas which are estimated to have reserves lasting from 30 to 50 years. The diminishing levels of oil and gas reserves become more critical each year and indicate a serious energy problem already exists here. Furthermore, U.S. reliance on foreign oil causes a negative balance of trade payments and obscures the realization of how serious the domestic fossil fuel situation is. Fortunately, U.S. coal reserves, projected to last about 100 years, give some time in which to develop renewable energy systems. Meanwhile the burning of coal resources creates serious environmental pollution problems which need to be overcome. Environmental Costs of Agriculture The use of inappropriate agricultural practices, like large monocultures and removal of shelterbelts, contributes to serious wind and water erosion. Soil and water losses are responsible for significant economic and environmental on-site costs in U.S. agriculture. Each year the estimated 4 billion tons of soil and 130 billion tons of water lost from 400 million acres of U.S. cropland translate into an on-site economic loss of more than $27 billion. The most significant component of this cost is the loss of valuable soil nutrients, which must be replaced by increased applications of fossil-based fertilizers in order to maintain and augment yields. In addition, erosion causes a loss of biodiversity that is impossible to quantify in terms of dollars, although preservation of soil biota is of major benefit to maintaining soil quality and productivity. Erosion causes significant ecological damage, in the form of siltation of aquatic systems and destruction of stream and lake ecosystems. Frequently, some pesticides and fertilizers contained in eroded agricultural sediments may poison fish and other wildlife.

The realization is dawning that it is global industrialization that is the root cause of human misery, and the motivation to bring that inhumane system to an end is growing as fast as the global human population.

As long as this situation holds, it is just a matter of time until the global-nuclear-war solution is implemented, since continuing on the present course leads to a \u201cdead\u201d planet. It would appear that global nuclear war will happen very soon, for two main reasons, alluded to above.  First, human poverty and misery are increasing at an incredible rate.  There are now three billion more desperately poor people on the planet than there were just forty years ago.  Despite decades of industrial development, the number of wretchedly poor people continues to soar.  The pressure for war mounts as the population explodes.  Second, war is motivated by resource scarcity -- the desire of one group to acquire the land, water, energy, or other resources possessed by another.

According to the World Bank and the United Nations, from 1 to 2 billion humans are now malnourished, indicating a combination of insufficient food, low incomes, and inadequate distribution of food. This is the largest number of hungry humans ever recorded in history. In China about 80 million are now malnourished and hungry. Based on current rates of increase, the world population is projected to double from roughly 6 billion to more than 12 billion in less than 50 years (Pimentel et al., 1994). As the world population expands, the food problem will become increasingly severe, conceivably with the numbers of malnourished reaching 3 billion. Based on their evaluations of available natural resources, scientists of the Royal Society and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences have issued a joint statement reinforcing the concern about the growing imbalance between the world's population and the resources that support human lives (RS and NAS, 1992). Reports from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, numerous other international organizations, and scientific research also confirm the existence of this serious food problem. For example, the per capita availability of world grains, which make up 80 per cent of the world's food, has been declining for the past 15 years (Kendall and Pimentel, 1994). Certainly with a quarter million people being added to the world population each day, the need for grains and all other food will reach unprecedented levels.

Balanced against these, are the impacts a doubling of the U.S. population can be expected to inflict on these natural resources. Not only does population expansion reduce available cropland per capita, but on going soil erosion and expanding urbanization continually result in the slow but continuous loss of cropland. Annually, more than 2 million acres of prime cropland are lost to erosion, salinization, and waterlogging. In addition, more than I million acres are lost from cultivation as urbanization, transportation networks and industries take over croplands. Furthermore, soil erosion removes about $20 billion worth of plant nutrients from U.S. agricultural soils each year. At present these nutrients are being replaced by heavy applications of expensive, fossil energy-based fertilizers. Other fossil-based inputs, like pesticides and fossil-powered irrigation systems also are being used to offset soil degradation. Once land becomes seriously degraded and unproductive, however, farmers are forced to abandon it and look elsewhere for more land to cultivate.

New projections issued just four years later put the 2050 total at between 383 and 500 million, with continuing increases projected through the twenty-first century. In communities all across the United States, citizens are already grappling with increasing traffic congestion, a shortage of landfill space, and worsening air and water quality-all problems to which population growth makes a significant, if not exclusive, contribution.\" Their children could end their lives in a country twice as crowded, and probably more polluted, than it is now.Elsewhere, the effects of rapid population growth are far more severe. In the developing world, population growth has magnified the adverse effects of bad government policies and social inequities, contributing to extensive deforestation, land degradation, overcropping, urban overcrowding, and, in countries like Algeria, worrisome political trends. Among the wealthy industrial nations of Europe, meanwhile, population growth lies behind significant new social tensions and the growth of pernicious right-wing political movements. The cause: a continuing flow of humanity across the Mediterranean in search of the jobs that North Africa's inefficient economies are unable to generate fast enough to keep up with population growth. The region with the world's lowest population growth is bracing itself for worse to come from the region with the world's highest. Africa, which today has about as many inhabitants as Europe, could have three times Europe's population within a generation .14 Europe's immigration laws are already tightening as millions of dispossessed Africans are knocking on its doors. In the future national budgets in Europe will be stretched to provide the resource transfers needed to help African nations provide for their own. The implied threat to European nations, explains the Rand Corporation's Marten Van Heuven, is that \"either you visit the problem where it is or the problem will visit you.\"\" If a blow-up occurs or if Islamic fundamentalists take control of a country like Algeria, a million or more refugees, including European expatriates, could head for Europe seeking asylum, according to European estimates.16 Population issues should command the attention of the public and policymakers for another reason: Demographic change is contributing to political and social dislocations that could put the most serious strains on the international system in the post-cold war era. Future threats to global security are likely to be highly decentralized-what Harvard government professor Stanley Hoffman calls an \"epidemic of local chaos\"\"-as population growth contributes to domestic instability in the developing world and to interstate competition for resources, including the land and water needed to grow food. The potential consequences of such competition are certain to be magnified as small states increase their stockpiles of sophisticated weapons.Population projections out to 2050 are dramatic and have dramatic implications. We're going to have to begin to deal with these implications, and that will change the content of security issues dramatically,\" says John Steinbruner, who directs foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"Along with the internationalization of the economy and the information revolution, population creates an entirely new set of circumstances, altering the character of what we understand to be security. We have a major story on our hands here, and people will have to notice eventually. 1121 Rapid population growth can affect security in various ways. In rural settings, competition for land, intensified by rapid population growth, could be a catalyst to conflict between large landholders and impoverished peasants. In urban areas the combination of crowded conditions, pollution, crime, lack of sanitation, shortages of public services, and the frustration of expectations raised by broader exposure to the media, produce a considerable potential for violent upheaval, according to one group of scholars who recently reported on the implication of demographic trends on U.S. security.29 All around the developing world, meanwhile, governments are struggling to counteract the downward tow exerted by rapid population growth on economic growth and, in particular, on the potential for job creation. Some 500 million people are already un- or underemployed in developing countries, and 30 million more are entering the job market each year, according to the United Nations Population Fund.10 By the International Labor Organization's calculations, 350 million jobs will have to be created in less developed countries during the 1990s alone.\" Many ,experts doubt that capital and technology can be created fast enough in poor countries to keep up with the demand. If they are correct, welfare costs and political discontent could escalate. Simultaneously, authoritarian rule could be imposed or strengthened as governments hard pressed to provide the health, housing, employment, and education needs of swelling populations seek to retain control. As one political leader warns in Mexico, a country that particularly worries U.S. policymakers: \"The consequences of not creating [at least] 15 million jobs in the next fifteen years are unthinkable. The youths who do not find them will have only three options: the United States, the streets or revolution.\"\"Rapid population growth can have other important, if less direct, consequences when it is linked to competition for scarce resources. In 1990 the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the University of Toronto assembled a group of thirty experts to evaluate the connection between environmental degradation and conflict.\" The panel reported that deteriorating environmental conditions, which are partly the result of population pressures, have already contributed to dislocations and violent conflicts in many parts of the third world. Unless broad social, economic, and technical reforms are instituted in time, the panel concluded, such conflicts could foreshadow an upsurge of violence induced or aggravated by environmental decline.In the worst case, such violence could take the form of interstate strife. The most serious threat concerns control of rivers and watersheds. Experts predict that the intensification of competition for diminishing water supplies in regions like the Middle East, fueled in part by rapid population growth, will lead either to unprecedented cooperation or lethal conflict. 14 Conflict could also result as millions of \"environmental refugees\" abandon overworked, worn-out land in search of a better life. In one troubling precedent, population pressures have prompted an estimated 10 million Bengalis to quit Bangladesh since the 1970s and to migrate to the Indian states of Assam and Tripur, with their more favorable growing conditions. This surge of humanity has disrupted landholding patterns and economic relationships and engendered ethnic conflict.\"", ""], "id": "c1eb5e0aa0512bba5587d9d350c242439f2c5d9a6017d65cda31049f379defa4", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 9, 157], [2, 575, 584], [2, 590, 728], [2, 3865, 3936], [2, 3993, 4340], [2, 4943, 4966], [2, 5369, 5422], [2, 6809, 6941], [2, 7349, 7623]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[17, 42]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1994-01-01"}, {"tag": "Need to promote a population decrease or overpopulation will be inevitable", "cite": "Gray \u201902 (John, professor of European thought at the London School of Economics, \u201cWill Humanity Be Left Home Alone?\u201d, New Statesman, Aug 30, 2002 http://www.greatchange.org/ov-gray,home_alone.html) ", "body": ["", "The last mass extinction has not yet been fully explained. Many scientists believe it to have been the result of meteorites whose impact suddenly altered the global climate, but no-one can be sure. In contrast, the cause of the present mass extinction is not in doubt: human expansion. Homo sapiens are gutting the earth of biodiversity.  The lush natural world in which humans evolved is being rapidly transformed into a largely prosthetic environment. Crucially, in any time span that is humanly relevant, this loss of biodiversity is irreversible. True, life on earth recovered its richness after the last great extinction; but only after about 10 million years had passed. Unless something occurs to disrupt the trends under way, all future generations of human beings will live in a world that is more impoverished biologically than it has been for aeons.  Given the magnitude of this change, one would expect it to be at the centre of public debate. In fact, it is very little discussed. Organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund press on with their invaluable work, and there are occasional reports of the destruction of wilderness; but for the most part, politics and media debates go on as if nothing is happening. There are many reasons for this peculiar state of affairs, including the ingrained human habit of denying danger until its impact is imminent; but the chief reason is that it has become fashionable to deny the reality of overpopulation.  In truth, the root cause of mass extinction is too many people. As Wilson puts it in his book Consilience: \"Population growth can justly be called the monster on the land.\" Yet according to mainstream political parties and most environmental organizations, the despoliation of the environment is mainly the result of flaws in human institutions. If we are entering a desolate world, the reason is not that humans have become too numerous. It is because injustice prevents proper use of the earth's resources. There is no such thing as overpopulation.  Interestingly, this view is not accepted in many of the world's poor countries. China, India, Egypt and Iran all have population programs, as have many other developing nations. Opposition to population control is concentrated in rich parts of the world, notably the US, where the Bush administration pursues a fundamentalist vendetta against international agencies that provide family planning. It is understandable that rich countries should reject the idea of overpopulation. In their use of resources, they are themselves the most overpopulated. Their affluence depends on their appropriating a hugely disproportionate share of the world's non-renewable resources. If they ever face up to that reality, they will have to admit that their affluence is unsustainable.

In some parts of the world, population is actually declining. This is strikingly true in post-communist Russia. A precipitate fall in public health and living standards has led to a virtually unprecedented population collapse, which is set to accelerate further as an African-style AIDS die-off triggered by the country's enormous numbers of intravenous drug users begins to take hold. In other countries, such as Japan, Italy and Spain, declining fertility is leading to zero or negative population growth. Such examples have given currency to the silly notion that overpopulation is no longer an issue - that, if anything, it is a slowdown in population growth that we should be worrying about.  But while human numbers are falling in some parts of the world, in others they are exploding. The population of the Gulf States will double in around 20 years - against a background of nearly complete dependency on a single, depleting natural resource. Again, despite China's admirable one-child policy, its population will go on growing for much of this century. Globally, the human population will continue to rise for at least a century - even if worldwide fertility falls to replacement level tomorrow. In 1940, there were around two billion humans on the planet. Today, there are about six billion. Even on conservative projections, there will be nearly eight billion by 2050.  Eight billion people cannot be maintained without desolating the earth. Today, everyone aspires to live after the fashion of the world's affluent minority. That requires worldwide industrialization - as a result of which the human ecological footprint on the earth will be deeper than it has ever been. If the living standards of rich countries can be replicated worldwide, it is only by making further large inroads into the planetary patrimony of biological wealth.  Rainforests are the last great reservoirs of biodiversity, but they will have to be cleared and turned over to human settlement or food production. What is left of wilderness in the world will be made over to green desert. This is a bleak enough prospect, but what's worse is that it is a path from which there is no turning back.

It will cause the unfolding of a new kind of driven by environmental change. Or perhaps an unfolding on a global scale of the old kind of history, which saw the collapse of regional civilizations, going back to the earliest in history, in northern Mesopotamia, and subsequently Egypt, then the Mayan and many others scattered across all the inhabited continents except Australia.\" Wilson's \"new kind of history\" would involve a worldwide revolution in attitudes and policies. This would include universal access by women to the means of controlling their fertility, abandonment of the belief that there is a natural right to have as many children as you like, and a basic shift in attitudes to the environment in which it is accepted that our fate and that of the rest of life on earth are inseparably linked. These are the minimum conditions for the new kind of history of which Wilson writes.  Unfortunately, one has only to list these conditions to see that they are unrealizable. There cannot be a sustainable balance between natural resources and human needs so long as the number of people continues to increase, but a growing population can be seen as a weapon. Many Palestinians and Kurds view having large families as a survival strategy. In a world containing many intractable ethnic conflicts, there is unlikely to be a benign demographic transition to a lower birth rate.  The examples we have of societies in which population has declined in the absence of a big social crisis cannot be replicated worldwide. A policy of zero population growth requires universal availability of contraception and abortion, and limits on the freedom to breed; but the authority that could impose these conditions does not exist.  Humans have a long history of mass killing, but have rarely chosen to regulate their numbers intelligently and humanely. If population declines, it will be as a result of war, genocide or the kind of generalized social collapse that has taken place in post-communist Russia. The increase in human population that is under way is unprecedented and unsustainable. It cannot be projected into the future. More than likely, it will be cut short by the classical Malthusian forces of \"old history\". From a human point of view, this is an extremely discomforting prospect; but at least it dispels the nightmare of an age of solitude. The loss of biodiversity is real, and very often irreversible.

The sheer number of people on earth is already past what Paul Ehrlich has called the 'carrying capacity' of the planet. A vast numbers of people are becoming malnourished, marginalized, and disaffected 13, and there is an increased ecological destruction. 2  The present increases in human numbers and in per capita consumption has a considerable impact on the environment, disrupting ecosystems and depleting resources 14 - just about every step in the direction of reducing the effects of affluence and technology is negated by population growth. The more people are on earth, the more resources are needed to maintain them, and the greater is the amount of the waste-products escaping into the atmosphere. There is probably no practical way to achieve an improvement in this respect without population control. For example, as to the emission of greenhouse gases, every person who lives makes a contribution to the CO2 in the atmosphere by burning wood, coal, or oil. ... Small increases per person can have an enormous effect in China and India with huge populations there. The report of the Club of Rome stated already in 1972 that 'with the existing trend in population, food production, industrialization, resource use, and population continuing unchanged, limits to growth would be reached within a century'.  To achieve zero population growth in the twenty-first century even in the most developed countries, birthrates would have to fall well below replacement levels. The reason for the population momentum is the relative youth of the growing population.  The current situation is well demonstrated on the population of the Philippines, the islands of the archipelago being now one of the most densely populated areas in the world with 173 persons per square kilometre. 6 By 1960 the population of the Philippines was 6 million people. By 1949 it had jumped to 19.3 million; 1970 saw the population pass the 38.5 million mark, and in 1989 it was estimated to be 63.8 million. It was 70 million in 1991, and since 50% of the people are under the age of 18, the figure will most probably shoot past 100 million shortly after the year 2010. Meanwhile, the mangrove swamps are being destroyed, and 80% of the coral reefs, which are among the richest ecosystems on the planet, have been severely damaged. A third of the soil is severely damaged, two thirds are partly damaged, and the rain forest that once covered over 90% of the area will, it seems, soon be totally gone - only 10% survives now. 15 In 1988, a Catholic bishop in the Philippines presented a document called What is Happening in Our Beautiful Land? to the national meeting of all the bishops of the Philippines. They approved it, but only after taking out the statement on population, which was vital. This diminished the importance of the document and showed the reluctance of the Catholic Church to deal with the population problem, even though overpopulation is one of the most disastrous realities facing the Philippines and the planet. Population pressures will not go away with our refusal to face them.  Unless we solve the problem of overpopulation, all future generations will be impoverished. Where are the children and future generations going to grow food that they will need for their expanding numbers? For the sake of future generations, we need to 'lower population, alter consumption levels, and promote more resource-efficient technologies'. 16 We already know much of what is needed in order to solve the problem of overpopulation, but we are limiting ourselves to exhortations and promotion of general ideas. At the minimum, exchange of ideas on population control, family planning, and obstacles to it should be encouraged across cultural, religious and political boundaries. The present policy of fertility control, promoted by the leadership in the Catholic Church, may not be really pro-life when looked at from a wider angle.", ""], "id": "76e1de207e8ba66ffee6e50cc303ffb589469f66caba61e7d0dedbf8254a2014", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[4, 0, 149], [4, 149, 150], [4, 271, 570], [4, 698, 699], [4, 700, 964], [4, 1469, 1799], [4, 2312, 2462], [4, 3166, 3583], [4, 3680, 3920], [4, 3920, 3921]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2006-01-01"}, {"tag": "Every life save now is 10 killed in the crunch", "cite": "Paul Ehrlich, biologist, Stanford, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, June 16, 1984, p. 31", "body": ["", "Sooner or later population would completely outstrip the capacity of any other nation to supply food.

Consider first the positive possibilities. Slower world population growth offers many benefits, some of which have already been realized. Many economists believe, for example, that falling birthrates made possible the great economic boom that occurred in Japan and then in many other Asian nations beginning in the 1960s. As the relative number of children declined, so did the burden of their dependency, thereby freeing up more resources for investment and adult consumption. In East Asia, the working-age population grew nearly four times faster than its dependent population between 1965 and 1990, freeing up a huge reserve of female labor and other social resources that would otherwise have been committed to raising children. Similarly, China's rapid industrialization today is being aided by a dramatic decline in the relative number of dependent children. Over the next decade, the Middle East could benefit from a similar \"demographic dividend.\" Birthrates fell in every single Middle Eastern country during the 1990s, often dramatically. The resulting \"middle aging\" of the region will lower the overall dependency ratio over the next 10 to 20 years, freeing up more resources for infrastructure and industrial development. The appeal of radicalism could also diminish as young adults make up less of the population and Middle Eastern societies become increasingly dominated by middle-aged people concerned with such practical issues as health care and retirement savings. Just as population aging in the West during the 1980s was accompanied by the disappearance of youthful indigenous terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades and the Weather Underground, falling birthrates in the Middle East could well produce societies far less prone to political violence.

Demographers now predict that our numbers will peak at about nine billion in 2070, and then begin to fall. Most of the richer nations will top out long before then. Russia's population is already dwindling; if it weren't for immigration, Italy would be in the same position. Japan will start to shrink from next year onwards; Britain won't be far behind. Europe's population will fall 4% by 2025. The US will keep growing for a little longer, then follow the rest of us. The real surprise is that the poorer nations are likely to go the same way. Countries like China, Mexico, Algeria and Iran are ageing even faster than we are. Even so, because we are so much older already, it is the rich nations which will shrink first. Why is this happening? Partly because women now have better options than squeezing out as many babies as they can before they collapse into a premature old age. Partly because urbanisation means that children are no longer required to work in the fields. And partly because, in the rich world, they cost a fortune to bring up: a report published ten days ago suggested that British children cost an average of pounds 164,000. So as we age more we sprog less, and the result will be a smaller and older world. And this, surely, is what all those who want some lebensraum without the reich have been waiting for: an unforced, gentle decline of the seething masses, which will leave the survivors with more ecological and social space. Well the writer Philip Longman isn't among them. His forthcoming book, The Empty Cradle, which he summarises in this month's Foreign Affairs, proposes that demographic decline is a disaster. Longman makes the point, which can scarcely be denied, that as a population ages it becomes less capable of supporting itself. The US and Europe are already being sucked into the inevitable pensions crisis. In Germany the state now spends 14% of its GDP on pensions and healthcare for the elderly: this will grow to 24% by 2040. General Motors already has two and a half times as many pensioners as workers, and a pension shortfall of $19 billion. The IMF has warned the United States that the gap between its anticipated tax revenues and anticipated benefit payments amounts to five times its GDP.

In other words, complex dynamic systems remain in a nonequilibrium state through the continuous dissipation of available energy and material (essergy) extracted from their host environments. They require a constant input of energy/matter to maintain their internal order in the face of spontaneous entropic decay. Such self-organising nonequilibrium systems are therefore called \"dissipative structures.\" This extension of the second law is critical to human carrying capacity. Consider that: The human economy is one such highly-ordered, dynamic, far-from equilibrium dissipative structure. At the same time . . . The economy is an open, growing, subsystem of a materially closed, nongrowing ecosphere (Daly, 1992), and is therefore dependent on the formation of essergy in the ecosphere for its growth and developments. [This input to the economy from nature is the \"natural income\" referred to in Box 1] This relationship implies that beyond a certain point, the continuous growth of the economy can be purchased only at the expense of increasing disorder or entropy in the ecosphere. This is the point at which consumption by the economy exceeds natural income and would be manifested through the continuous depletion of natural capital --reduced biodiversity, air/water/land pollution, deforestation, atmospheric change, etc. In other words, the empirical evidence suggests that the aggregate human load already exceeds, and is steadily eroding, the very carrying capacity upon which the continued humane existence depends. Ultimately this poses the threat of unpredictable ecosystems restructuring (e.g., erratic climate change) leading to resource shortages, increased local strife, and the heightened threat of ecologically induced geopolitical instability. In this light, the behavior of complex systems and the role of the economy in the global thermodynamic hierarchy should be seen as fundamental to sustainability, yet both concepts are alien to the dominant development-oriented institutions in the world today.", ""], "id": "85ecf0e0ee3ce7e0c0cd629e1911b58d91ac94d9bf5c78828df00e6c9aed3481", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[4, 130, 224], [4, 255, 338], [4, 378, 504], [4, 513, 554], [4, 555, 613], [4, 614, 676], [4, 1271, 1272], [4, 1272, 1693], [4, 1711, 2129], [4, 2145, 2290]], "emphasis": [[2, 12, 144]], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1996-01-01"}, {"tag": "", "cite": "Abernathy, PhD @ Harvard and Professor of Anthropology @ Vanderbilt Medical School, 93", "body": ["(Dr. Virginia, Population Politics: the choices that shape our future, Carrying Capacity Network, 1993, http://www.dieoff.org/page58.htm)", "The carrying capacity is the number of individuals that an area can support without sustaining damage. Carrying capacity is exceeded if so many individuals use an area that their activities cause deterioration in the very systems that support them. Exceeding the carrying capacity sometimes harms an environment so severely that the new number who can be supported is smaller than the original equilibrium population. The carrying capacity would then have declined, perhaps permanently. Any number of elements or systems can be hurt by overuse. A field can be grazed down until the root systems of grasses are damaged; or so much game can be hunted off that food species are effectively extirpated. Now, the foragers that ate the grass or the predators that killed the game have lost a food source. In effect, the carrying capacity has been exceeded so that the population dependent on the area's productive systems is worse off than it was originally. Animal populations that destroy their niche come and go. If not too many examples come to mind, it is because they rather quickly go. The miniature ponies on Assateague Island illustrate a point on the continuum. They would overgraze their island, seriously depleting their future food supply, except for the fact that a portion of each year's colt crop is removed. Without human intervention (there are no predators and apparently no reservoir of infectious disease), the pony population would explode. Probably it happened in the past. Their very small size today is a vestigial effect of starvation, when only the tiniest, for whom the least blades of grass were lifesaving, survived. A population cannot be stable if, by its size or behavior, it destroys the very life-support systems on which it depends. Sooner or later, degradation of the environment is felt in inadequacies of the food or water supply, shelter, or havens where individuals can be safe and the young can develop.

The rapid depletion of these essential resources, coupled with a worldwide degradation of land (Jacobs 1991, Myers 1984, Postel 1989) and atmospheric quality (Jones and Wigley 1989, Schneider 199), indicate that the human enterprise has not only exceeded its current social carrying capacity, but it is actually reducing future potential biophysical carrying capacities by depleting essential natural capital stocks. The unusual consequence for an animal population that exceeds its local biophysical carrying capacity is a population decline, brought about by a combination of increased mortality, reduced fecundity, and emigration where possible (Klein 1968, Mech 1966, Scheffer 1951).

That cost now amounts to an annual loss of roughly 24 billion tons of topsoil (Brown and Wolfe, 1984), trillions of gallons of groundwater (e.g., Reisner, 1986), and millions of populations and species of other organisms (all involved in supplying ecosystem services crucial to food production - Ehrlich and Daily, 1993).

Since 1948, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, annual world food production has outpaced the increase in population. Today, per capita production and per-acre yields are at all-time highs. Prices of agricultural products have been falling for over 100 years. The average inflation-adjusted price of those products, indexed to wages, fell by more than 74 percent between 1950 and 1990. While Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute and the noted butterfly expert Paul Ehrlich predict higher food prices and increasing scarcity, food is becoming cheaper and more plentiful. That good news is due largely to technological advances (the \"green revolution\") that have provided better seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and methods of farming. The only obstacles to agricultural progress are the impediments created by governments. Imagine what the world would be like today if the fertile farmland of the former Soviet Union or China or India had been in productive private hands operating in free markets for the past several decades. Since permitting market incentives in agriculture, India has been come a net food exporter and agricultural production in China has boomed.Catastrophists argue that the bright past does not imply a bright future; they arbitrarily assert that mankind has crossed some fateful threshold. But the earth is capable of feeding many more people than are now alive. The late Roger Revelle of Harvard University (whom Gore claims as a mentor) estimated that Africa, Asia, and Latin America alone, simply by using water more efficiently, could feed 35 to 40 billion people--seven to eight times the current world population. And that assumes no change in technology--a groundless assumption, to be sure. Those who annually predict imminent famine (while urging readers to subscribe to next year's publications) seize on any change as evidence that man's alleged strain on the biosphere is finally beginning to show. Thus, if the price of seafood rises, they announce that the seas are nearing exhaustion. They never consider the myriad other possibilities, such as the shift in diet from meat to fish, the decline of the Russian fishing industry during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, or the \"tragedy of the commons\" associated with the lack of property rights in the oceans and lakes.

The developing world's rate dropped from 6.2 to 4.1--more than halfway to the replacement rate. East Asia went from 5.5 to 2.3, South America from 4.9 to 3.6. The laggard, again, is Africa, where the rate fell from 6.5 to only 6.4. Thus, the world's population has been heading toward stabilization for 30 years. The population controllers will credit that to their efforts (while complaining that not enough is being done). But there is a simpler explanation: as economies develop and people become better off materially, they have fewer children. That phenomenon, known as the demographic transition, is well established in demography. It explains what happened in the West, where today the fertility rate is 2.0 or lower--below replacement rate. The demographic transition makes perfect sense. In preindustrial, agricultural economies, children provide farm labor and social security (sons care for their elderly parents); children are wealth. In a developed economy, parents invest resources (for education and the like) in their children; they are an expense. As societies become Westernized, and as modern consumer goods and services become available, people find sources of satisfaction other than children. So they have fewer kids. A falling infant-mortality rate also reduces a society's fertility rate.  Thus, a low fertility rate, writes Peter Bauer, is an effect, not a cause, of development. Arguments for population control programs in the developing world, which shift child-bearing decisions from couples to the state, are wrong. Those programs are also an affront to human dignity, privacy, and liberty, whether they compel women to have abortions and to be sterilized (as they do in China) or \"merely\" deprive people of income and vital services because they want more children than the government wishes.

Studies show a strong correlation between affluence and longevity; as the late Aaron Wildavsky liked to say, wealthier is healthier. The lengthening life expectancy in the developing world is evidence that population growth cannot be increasing poverty. History makes the same point. The West grew rich precisely when its population was increasing at an unprecedented rate. Between 1776 and 1975, while the world's population increased sixfold, real gross world product rose about 80-fold.  In our own century we have seen a replay of the Industrial Revolution. After World War II the population of Hong Kong grew more quickly than that of 19th-century England or 20th-century India--at the same time that resource-poor island-colony was growing rich. The increases in population and wealth have not been merely coincidental. They are causes and effects of each other. Today, with few exceptions, the most densely populated countries are the richest. Any mystery in that is dispelled by the realization that people are the source of ideas. The addition of people geometrically increases the potential for combining ideas into newer, better ideas. As the Nobel laureate and economist Simon Kuznets wrote, \"More population means more creators and producers, both of goods along established production patterns and of new knowledge and inventions.\" A growing population also allows for a more elaborate division of labor, which raises incomes. Those who wish to stifle population growth would condemn hundreds of millions of people in the developing world to the abject deprivation that characterized the West before the Industrial Revolution.

All over the world, people are living longer. More babies survive infancy than ever before, and more people are reaching old age. That cannot be squared with the assertion that living standards are falling, that food production is declining, and that the air and water are more dangerous to human life. \"Human comfort,\" wrote John Rickman, a contemporary chronicler of the Industrial Revolution, \"is to be estimated by human health, and that by the length of human life.\"  It should be unnecessary to emphasize the increase in longevity: without it there would be no population explosion for the catastrophists to complain of. The increase in the number of human beings has not occurred because women are having more children than before. The increase is chiefly the result of the falling mortality rate, which economist Julian Simon calls \"man's triumph over death.\" It should be the occasion for celebration, but the catastrophists prefer sackcloth. In the period 1950-55, there were 159 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the developing world. By 1980-85, the number plunged by over 42 percent--to 92. In East Asia, infant mortality dropped 71 percent. In South America, the drop averaged 52 percent. Even in Africa, the world's laggard, infant mortality dropped 38 percent. In the industrialized world, the rate fell more than 69 percent. The increase in life expectancy at birth has been equally dramatic. Between 1950-55 and 1980-85, the average increase worldwide was 13 years, up 29 percent. In the industrialized world, life expectancy went from 65 years to 73 years. But the biggest news was in the developing world, where the increase went from 41 to over 56--a 38 percent increase. The most dramatic increases were in East Asia, where more than 25 years were added to peoples' lives (for a total of 68 years), a 60 percent gain. In South America there was an average gain of almost 11 years, and in Africa the gain was over 12 years. \"The increase in average life expectancy during the twentieth century,\" the late David Osterfeld wrote in Progress versus Planning: How Government Stifles Economic Growth, \"equals or exceeds the gains made in all the preceding centuries combined.\" In A Moment on the Earth, Gregg Easterbrook points out that \"it cannot be noted too often that the spectacular worldwide increase in human lifespans has come during the very period when global use of synthetic chemicals, fossil fuels, high-yield agriculture, and radioactive substances has increased exponentially--a fantastic flowering of life coincident with the very influences doomsday orthodoxy depicts as antithetical to life.\" "], "id": "d696a3ce100f10f9be94fc63343193b0efcc1c0c8407fc5020d0c824002e55c7", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 0, 192], [3, 238, 490], [3, 667, 819], [3, 1541, 1773], [3, 2452, 2825]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 11]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1995-07-20"}, {"tag": "Overpopulation is just a media myth", "cite": "D'Agostino 08\u2019", "body": ["Joseph A.

The use of pesticides in LDCs, for example was expected to increased between 400 to 600% in the last 25 years of the twentieth century. 10 During the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth.11 However, this increase was not evenly distributed throughout the world. For example, in Africa, food pro-duction decreased, while population increased. And world cereal production fell in 1993, according to the FAO, which predicted a food shortage in 20 countries during 1994. 12 However, most experts agree that there is no shortage of food, and that equitable distribution should be sufficient to meet all needs for the future. Lack of money to buy food is the problem of malnourishment. Pov-erty, in effect translates the world adequacy into national and local shortages. Within households, men and boys have priority for whatever food is available, while women and children, especially girl children are the first to suffer malnu-trition. Few resources are available to women, even though they are often re-sponsible the for food supply.13 ", "", "\n"], "id": "fbde5aed35e47b5135f19791b4a695eb72fd291476e28c65726ef0a5b1cf29b6", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 0, 135], [3, 710, 806], [3, 971, 1094], [3, 1387, 1527]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2002-01-01"}, {"tag": "", "cite": "Llewellyn H.

You are surrounded by the blessings of capitalism. The buffet table, which you and your lunch partners only had to walk into a building to find, has a greater variety of food at a cheaper price than that which was available to any living person \u2014 king, lord, duke, plutocrat, or pope \u2014 in almost all of the history of the world. Not even fifty years ago would this have been imaginable.    All of history has been defined by the struggle for food. And yet that struggle has been abolished, not just for the rich but for everyone living in developed economies. The ancients, peering into this scene, might have assumed it to be Elysium. Medieval man conjured up such scenes only in visions of Utopia. Even in the late 19th century, the most gilded palace of the richest industrialist required a vast staff and immense trouble to come anywhere near approximating it.    We owe this scene to capitalism. To put it differently, we owe this scene to centuries of capital accumulation at the hands of free people who have put capital to work on behalf of economic innovations, at once competing with others for profit and cooperating with millions upon millions of people in an ever-expanding global network of the division of labor. The savings, investments, risks, and work of hundreds of years and uncountable numbers of free people have gone into making this scene possible, thanks to the ever-remarkable capacity for a society developing under conditions of liberty to achieve the highest aspirations of the society's members.    And yet, sitting on the other side of the table are well-educated people who imagine that the way to end the world's woes is through socialism. Now, people's definitions of socialism differ, and these persons would probably be quick to say that they do not mean the Soviet Union or anything like that. That was socialism in name only, I would be told. And yet, if socialism does mean anything at all today, it imagines that there can be some social improvement resulting from the political movement to take capital out of private hands and put it into the hands of the state. Other tendencies of socialism include the desire to see labor organized along class lines and given some sort of coercive power over how their employers' property is used. It might be as simple as the desire to put a cap on the salaries of CEOs, or it could be as extreme as the desire to abolish all private property, money, and even marriage.    Whatever the specifics of the case in question, socialism always means overriding the free decisions of individuals and replacing that capacity for decision making with an overarching plan by the state. Taken far enough, this mode of thought won't just spell an end to opulent lunches. It will mean the end of what we all know as civilization itself. It would plunge us back to a primitive state of existence, living off hunting and gathering in a world with little art, music, leisure, or charity. Nor is any form of socialism capable of providing for the needs of the world's six billion people, so the population would shrink dramatically and quickly and in a manner that would make every human horror ever known seem mild by comparison. Nor is it possible to divorce socialism from totalitarianism, because if you are serious about ending private ownership of the means of production, you have to be serious about ending freedom and creativity too. You will have to make the whole of society, or what is left of it, into a prison.    In short, the wish for socialism is a wish for unparalleled human evil. If we really understood this, no one would express casual support for it in polite company. It would be like saying, you know, there is really something to be said for malaria and typhoid and dropping atom bombs on millions of innocents.    Do the people sitting across the table really wish for this? Certainly not. So what has gone wrong here? Why can these people not see what is obvious? Why can't people sitting amidst market-created plenty, enjoying all the fruits of capitalism every minute of life, see the merit of the market but rather wish for something that is a proven disaster?    What we have here is a failure of understanding. That is to say, a failure to connect causes with effects. This is a wholly abstract idea. Knowledge of cause and effect does not come to us by merely looking around a room, living in a certain kind of society, or observing statistics. You can study roomfuls of data, read a thousand treatises on history, or plot international GDP figures on a graph for a living, and yet the truth about cause and effect can still be evasive. You still might miss the point that it is capitalism that gives rise to prosperity and freedom. You might still be tempted by the notion of socialism as savior.    Let me take you back to the years 1989 and 1990. These were the years that most of us remember as the time when socialism collapsed in Eastern Europe and Russia. Events of that time flew in the face of all predictions on the Right that these were permanent regimes that would never change unless they were bombed back to the Stone Age. On the Left, it was widely believed, even in those times, that these societies were actually doing quite well and would eventually pass the United States and Western Europe in prosperity, and, by some measures, that they were already better off than us.    And yet it collapsed. Even the Berlin Wall, that symbol of oppression and slavery, was torn down by the people themselves. It was not only glorious to see socialism collapse. It was thrilling, from a libertarian point of view, to see how states themselves can dissolve. They may have all the guns and all the power, and the people have none of those, and yet, when the people themselves decide that they will no longer be governed, the state has few options left. It eventually collapses amid a society-wide refusal to believe its lies any longer.    When these closed societies suddenly became open, what did we see? We saw lands that time forgot. The technology was backwards and broken. The food was scarce and disgusting. The medical care was abysmal. The people were unhealthy. Property was polluted.    It was also striking to see what had happened to the culture under socialism. Many generations had been raised under a system built on power and lies, and so the cultural infrastructure that we take for granted was not secure. Such notions as trust, promise, truth, honesty, and planning for the future \u2014 all pillars of commercial culture \u2014 had become distorted and confused by the ubiquity and persistence of the statist curse.

Eastern European nations are now rushing to become members of the European Union, and China is undertaking market-oriented reforms. Cuba and North Korea stand as the last remaining communist stalwarts.    One would think that this failure of communist central planning would have unleashed a groundswell of support for its main ideological alternative: economic freedom or market capitalism. But as the anti-globalization protestors in Seattle and at last week's G8 meeting in Canada demonstrate, economic freedom still has a long way to go to win over the hearts and minds of many people.    These protesters believe that free markets lead to widespread poverty, greater gaps between the rich and the poor, and environmental degradation. Only strong government planning through trade tariffs, expansive welfare states, and strict labor and environmental rules can protect the poor of this world from the ravaging forces of the market. These people are dead wrong.     A new study, co-authored by James Gwartney and myself, was recently released by a consortium of think tanks, which includes the Cato Institute in the United States. This publication, Economic Freedom of the World: 2002 Annual Report, presents an economic freedom index for 123 countries. Based on 37 data components drawn from a multitude of sources, this index measures the degree to which nations are pursing policies consistent with economic freedom or market capitalism. To score highly on this index, a nation should have low government spending and taxes, sound property rights and legal system, sound money, liberal trade policies, and few government regulations. Economic freedom means that each individual plays the primary role in his economic life, not the government or central plan.    The most economically free nation in the world remains Hong Kong followed by Singapore and the United States. The rankings of other major economies are the United Kingdom (4th), Canada (8th), Germany (15th), Japan (24th) Taiwan (30th), France (38th), Mexico (66th), and India (73rd). Most of the lowest ranked nations are in Africa and Latin America. Botswana has the best record for an African nation, tied for 38th with six other nations including France and South Korea. Chile, with the best record in Latin America, was tied with three other nations at 15th. Three former communist countries are in the bottom 10: Russia (116th), Ukraine (119th), and Romania (114th) all did worse than communist China (101st). Data for North Korea and Cuba are not available.    The study also shows that economic freedom is strongly linked with both higher levels of income and faster rates of economic growth. The people living in the top one-fifth of the most free countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s.    That economic freedom leads to more and faster wealth creation is no longer a controversial argument. But what of the argument that market capitalism leaves the poor behind? In fact, the poor gain a lot from economic freedom. The share of income going to the poorest 10% of the population is completely unrelated to economic freedom. But poor people are much better off with economic freedom. The poorest 10% of the population have an average income of just $728 in the least free countries compared with over $7000 in the most free countries. Simply put, it is much better to be poor in a free, rich country than an unfree, poor country.    Free people live longer too. The life expectancy of people living in the most free nations is fully 20 years longer than for people in the least free countries. This is quite literally the difference between knowing your grandchildren or not.    Other studies confirm that environmental quality is likely to be enhanced as poor countries become wealthy enough, through economic freedom, to invest in environmental amenities like water treatment plants.    People who are concerned about poverty and environmental issues around the globe must realize that economic freedom and the resulting economic prosperity, not oppressive government taxation and regulation, represent the best hope for the poor and the environment alike.

Critics of globalization never tire of reminding us of this injustice. Far less often do we hear a proper analysis of the reason for this state of affairs.    The critics make it sound as though the poor are poor because the rich are rich, as if the richest 20 percent had somehow stolen those resources from the other 80 percent. That is wrong. The affluent world has grown fastest since losing its colonies. And the regions the imperialist countries subjugated grew faster after becoming colonies than they had previously. Several of the world's richest countries -- such as Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries -- never had any colonies of importance. Others, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, were colonies themselves. On the other hand, several of the world's least developed countries -- Afghanistan, Liberia, and Nepal, for example -- have never been colonies.    The main reason for that 20 percent consuming 80 percent of the resources is that they produce 80 percent of resources. The 80 percent consume only 20 percent because they produce only 20 percent of resources. It is this latter problem we ought to tackle. The problem is that many people are poor, not that certain people are rich.       Critics of capitalism point out that per capita GDP is more than 30 times greater in the world's 20 richest countries than in the 20 poorest. The critics are right to say that this inequality is due to capitalism -- but not for the reasons they think. The difference is due to certain countries having taken the path of capitalism, resulting in fantastic prosperity for their inhabitants, while those choosing to impede ownership, trade, and production have lagged behind. Factors such as climate and natural disasters are not unimportant, but most of the gap can still be put down to certain countries having opted for liberalization and others for control.    The 20 economically most liberal countries in the world have a per capita GDP about 29 times greater than the 20 economically least liberal. If, then, we are serious about closing the North-South divide, we should hope with all our hearts that the South will also gain access to a free economy and open markets. Developing countries that have had openness in recent decades have not only grown faster than other developing countries -- they have grown faster than the affluent countries too.    The world's inequality is due to capitalism. Not to capitalism making certain groups poor, but to its making its practitioners wealthy. The uneven distribution of wealth in the world is due to the uneven distribution of capitalism.    Trade and investment flows in the past two decades have come to be more and more evenly distributed among the economies that are relatively open to the rest of the world.

Countries that lost at least 5 points of economic freedom, by contrast, saw poverty levels increase. The same positive trends are evident in connection with social development in areas like education, health, child or maternal mortality, and overall life expectancy, as well as in protection of the environment, where countries that are more economically free do a far better job than their less free counterparts. Given these positive long term trends, and the proven good economic results in countries around the world that respect principles of economic freedom and market-based decision-making, I would submit that the first responsibility of policy makers in leading economies, especially in a time of downturn or crisis, is to preserve the capitalist system and to do no harm.

What\u2019s more, throughout history, one form of injustice has usually been replaced by another that is far worse. Russia\u2019s 1917 revolution expelling the Czars and their injustices ushered in Lenin, Stalin, and a succession of brutal dictators who murdered tens of millions in the name of the proletarian revolution. The injustices of Chiang Kai-shek were replaced with those of Mao Zedong; Castro\u2019s ousting of Batista and Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s toppling of the Shah of Iran produced regimes far more brutal. After Africa became independent the injustices of colonial powers were replaced with those of brutal dictators.    The slaughter of nearly 200 million poor souls, not including war deaths, during the twentieth century was a direct result of the pursuit of visions of social justice, such as income equality, the common good, and the various alternatives to the so-called evils of capitalism. As if by design, measures taken to produce what was seen as the good society lowered both the common man\u2019s human-rights protections and his standard of living.    By contrast, after the American revolution, we laid the groundwork that produced the world\u2019s freest people. However, for most of the twentieth century, we have been losing ground. If you ask which way are we heading\u2014away from totalitarianism or toward it\u2014there is no question that, by tiny steps, we are heading toward totalitarianism and arbitrary governmental abuse and control.    Some Americans are naive enough to think that the oppression seen in other countries can\u2019t happen here. But let\u2019s not forget that the country that gave the world great men like Goethe, von Humboldt, Beethoven, Bach, and Schiller also gave us Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Treblinka. Also keep in mind that it was German-Americans who helped create the underground railroad to assist runaway slaves, and it was German-Americans who had the best reputation for getting along with the Indians. Let\u2019s also not forget that pre-Nazi Germany provided Jews with one of the most hospitable climates in Europe, so much so that during the early 1900s, in nearly one-half of all Jewish marriages, one of the spouses was a German gentile.    If social justice has any operational meaning at all, it is that the purpose of law is to prevent one person from violating another person\u2019s fight to acquire, keep, and dispose of property in any manner so long as he doesn\u2019t violate another\u2019s simultaneously held fights, In other words, laws should be written to prevent force and fraud. Laws that force one person to serve the purposes of another are immoral. These values, expressed in our Declaration of Independence as the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, guided the framers in the writing of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Today, our government has become increasingly destructive of the ends it was created to serve. Americans have become increasingly hostile and alien to the liberties envisioned by the framers. We have disregarded the inscription that graces the U.S. Department of Justice: \"Where the law ends tyranny begins.\"  Why Is Slavery Immoral?    Most people agree that slavery is immoral. But what makes it so? Slavery denies a person the right to use his property (body) and the fruits of his labor as he sees fit. Slavery forcibly uses one person to serve the purposes of another. Tragically, most Americans, including blacks, whose ancestors have suffered from gross property-rights violations, think it quite proper for one person to be forced to serve the purposes of another. That\u2019s what income redistribution really is. That\u2019s also what theft and robbery are. We could call slavery income redistribution. Income redistribution, theft, and slavery are all practices in which the fruits of one person\u2019s labor are confiscated for the benefit of another.    Article 1, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution enumerates the functions of the federal government and gives it taxing authority to carry out these functions. For the most part these functions relate to national defense, federal courts, copyrights and patents, coining money, borrowing, and a few other activities. With even a cursory reading of the Constitution, one cannot find any authority for Congress to confiscate the property of one American and give it to another. Yet this activity now constitutes over two-thirds of federal expenditures that will top $1.7 trillion dollars in 1998. Expenditures that have that characteristic include Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies, business bailouts and subsidies, disaster insurance, and expenditures by the departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Commerce, and Education. These government activities and many others have been justified in the name of promoting social justice.    In the pursuit of social justice, personal liberty has become a secondary or tertiary matter. Consider the following as just one example: suppose a citizen, as an emancipated adult, sent the following affidavit to Congress: \"I hereby renounce any claim to Social Security benefits and Medicare services, If I don\u2019t prepare for my later years or poor health, I shall depend on the charity of others or suffer the consequences. Release me from further Social Security and Medicare \u2018contributions.\u2019\" A safe bet is that Congress would greet such an affidavit with contempt.  The Price of Abstaining    Suppose I refused to make payments into Social Security What would happen to me? First, a fine would be assessed. Suppose I refused to pay the fine? I\u2019d be threatened with property confiscation. Then suppose I tried to protect my property from the actions of the agents of Congress? I would surely be killed.    You say, \"But Williams, you\u2019re violating the law- people can\u2019t go about deciding which laws they will obey!\" My response is that laws do not determine what is or is not moral conduct. In Nazi Germany, there were laws that required the reporting of a person hiding a Jew. In our country, the Fugitive Slave Act made assisting runaway slaves a crime. In apartheid South Africa, hiring blacks for certain work was illegal. In the former East Germany, assisting people in their efforts to escape to the West was illegal. Would any decent person demand that any of these laws be obeyed? Decent people must always ask: does the law have a moral basis?    Liberty is not mankind\u2019s normal state of affairs, Liberty is fragile. Our liberties are under siege because most Americans are ignorant about our Constitution and its philosophical underpinnings. Thus, we fall easy prey to political charlatans and quacks all too ready to exploit this ignorance in their quest for power and to satisfy popular visions of social justice.", ""], "id": "47bfea947dd7e3f2294ac05fbb2b3114fa1141f0b9272a3291b268b7ab3b8faa", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 0, 449], [2, 689, 829], [2, 830, 964], [2, 2234, 2235], [2, 2235, 2235], [2, 2239, 2648], [2, 2648, 2649], [2, 4894, 4986], [2, 6453, 6821], [2, 6821, 6822]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[7, 15], [101, 103]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "1998-07-01"}, {"tag": "Capitalism is key to the protection of all rights.", "cite": "Edward Romar, Lecturer in Management \u2013 U.

It  was not his intention to prescribe a detailed ethical  system to support free market capitalism because to  do so would violate his principle of freedom and  curtail the creativity of markets. Yet, the world described  by Hayek is one where individuals have  substantial power to control their destiny and seek  their own level, a world where talent and risk  dominate, a world governed by self interest, a world  where individuals have few responsibilities to others,  and a world driven by competition where reward  goes to the successful. He described a world open to  Nietzschean ethics.  In The Road to Serfdom (1994) and The Fatal  Conceit (1988) Hayek presents a powerful and eloquent  attack on twentieth century totalitarianism. In  The Road to Serfdom he argues that the socialist  experiment must inevitably lead to totalitarianism  and the complete elimination of individual liberty  and freedom. In the name of principles of social  justice, society installs a system of centralized social  and economic planning, substitutes collective decisions  for individual ones, and requires each person to  adopt an identical and complete set of social values.  Furthermore, to achieve its objectives, the socialist  state must determine in great detail the allocation of  resources and insure that each individual performs  precisely his/her assigned role. Planned economies  must substitute collectivist thought, values and  behavior and eliminate any room for individualism.  Hayek labels this weltanschauung the \u2018\u2018fatal conceit.\u2019\u2019  It is fatal because it cannot achieve its objectives  and it is conceit because it overestimates the  role of human rationality and man\u2019s ability to control  social and economic processes. He sees constructivist  continental European philosophic thought, primarily  Cartesian rationalism, as the source of this error  (Hayek, 1948, pp. 9\u201310; 1973, pp. 9\u201312). This  philosophic tradition argues that man can understand  the world completely and, therefore, social and  economic processes can be understood completely  and molded to fit human will.  Hayek considers this a foolish, self-serving and  arrogant position.4 Certainly, humans have a powerful  intellect and reasoning skills. Human reason,  though powerful, has its limitations and cannot  completely understand with any certainty how human  institutions and social processes evolved and  how they operate. He views the evolution and  development of human institutions, be they money,  markets, or ethics as spontaneous, self-generating  orders. Systems, if you will, evolving gradually,  accidentally, on the basis of incremental change; not  as a result of human design. He labels this \u2018\u2018between  instinct and reason.\u2019\u2019 Humans can understand to  some extent how human society evolved from clan  based societies into modern, complex ones based  upon individualism and abstract rules, but we cannot  know the processes or mechanisms of this evolution  in sufficient detail to bend them to our will. We can  tweak the social and moral systems but cannot  engineer them. Man can modify social processes and  their underlying ethical foundations; but, in the final  analysis, we must accept them as is.5  Since social process and institutions obey their  own set of evolutionary principles which man cannot  know completely, it is best for these to evolve  on their own, without much human interference. In  The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation  and Liberty (3 vols., 1973, 1976, 1979) Hayek  develops his ideas about the proper principles of  economic and political organizations and their  underlying ethical foundations. The fundamental  principle of social organization must be based upon  the principle of liberty, which may be defined as  \u2018\u2018that condition of men in which coercion of some  by others is reduced as much as possible in society\u2019\u20196  (Hayek, 1960, p. 11). Hayek\u2019s conception of the  free, just and moral society is not one where there is  a complete absence of coercion but where coercion  is limited to those situations where it is required to  prevent a reduction in the liberty of others. Society  may use coercion to protect private property and to  secure individual rights and conditions which allow  each person the maximum amount of personal  freedom to make choices of their own. This is  accomplished through a limited set of abstract rules  \u2018\u2018that apply equally to all\u2019\u2019 which protect private or  several property, enforce contracts, and prevent  fraud and deception\u2019\u2019 (Hayek, 1960, pp. 140, 141,  143, 155).  While Hayek is concerned with just and moral  principles of economic, political and social organization,  he views attempts to achieve \u2018\u2018distributive  justice\u2019\u2019 as the root cause of the immorality brought  about by planned economies. In order to achieve the  desired goals, human behavior must be planned in  minute detail, thereby eliminating freedom of  choice. Achieving collectivist goals mean that there  can be no individual ones. Organizing to control  every outcome means there cannot be individual  choice. Social control means there will be little  individual control and it is all doomed because humans  cannot understand completely the mechanisms  needed to reach their objectives. The only solution  must be the free market and the minimal organizational  principles required for it to operate efficiently.  Since these are few and well known, it will be easier  to succeed and create a just and moral society. Allow  the market free reign and the just and moral society  will follow according to its own principles.", "", "", "Capitalism Creates An Incentive For Equal Opportunity Because Of The Competitiveness That It Entails"], "id": "28ee84595b7795c6e58af1efab61a0e96cde5974623fde2918a051220a95b8f2", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 211, 280], [2, 323, 491], [2, 492, 527], [2, 604, 976], [2, 1261, 1344], [2, 1370, 1771], [2, 1771, 1772], [2, 1787, 2335], [2, 2414, 2435], [2, 2535, 2591], [2, 2604, 2763], [2, 3606, 4007], [2, 4247, 4471], [2, 5268, 5296], [2, 5297, 5668], [2, 5856, 6190]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[7, 12], [192, 194]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2009-01-01"}, {"tag": "Lewis \u201992 [Martin W., Assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Regional Science, George Washington University, Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism, Durham: Duke University Press, 1992, 173-4]", "cite": "The same underlying patterns may be seen, albeit in weaker form, in the United States.

Efficient corporations welcome talented individuals from all social ranks into their middle and upper echelons-so long as they are adept at making profits.

Yet these plagues are nothing compared to those that have been caused by human action. The most destructive catastrophes are man-made, and above all statesman-made. They come from his appetite for conquest and domination, from the dead-end political systems he thinks up, his uncountable religious or ideological fanaticisms, and, especially, his obsessive need to reform societies instead of letting them change at their own pace. Democracy blocks, or at least slows down, this disastrous-and wicked-human propensity. Twentieth-century history is clear on two points: only capitalism engenders economic development; only democracy can correct the worst political abuses and errors. This is why humanity faces a stark choice: democratic capitalism or extinction. I would revise Michael Novak's term to read: democratic and liberal capitalism. For capitalism can be illiberal-protectionist and closely associated to the state. In this case, it is not as much of an obstacle to development and individual liberty as is socialism, but it hinders them and creates incentives for the corruption of political leaders. Liberal democratic capitalism is not the best system: it is the only one [that works]. The parrots who keep telling us about its imperfections are right, it is imperfect. But the only prohibitive vice for a system, is not for it to be without vices, but to be without qualities. And what we know about all the tested alternatives to liberal democratic capitalism is that they are without qualities. It deserves plenty of criticism, but these should not lead to the temptation of returning to collectivism or even milder forms of state control. Of course democratic capitalism has its share of sins; but as Robert Nozick put it, socialism does seem to be an excessively heavy punishment for them.

But he does not understand the system he wants to reform, let alone what he would substitute in its place.  According to Speth, \u201cmost environmental deterioration is a result of systemic failures of capitalism.\u201d This is an odd claim, as the least capitalist nations of the world also have the worst environmental records. The ecological costs of economic statism are far worse than those of economic liberty. The environmental record of the various Soviet regimes amply bears this out: The West\u2019s ecological nightmares were the Soviet bloc\u2019s environmental realities. This is not due to any anomaly of the Soviet system. Nations with greater commitment to capitalist institutions experience greater environmental performance.  While Speth occasionally acknowledges pockets of environmental progress, he hardly stops to consider the reasons why some environmental resources have been conserved more effectively than others. Fisheries are certainly declining throughout much of the world\u2014some 75 percent of fisheries are fully or over-exploited\u2014but not everywhere. It is worth asking why. Tropical forests in less-developed nations are declining even as most temperate forests in industrialized nations are rebounding. Recognizing these different trends and identifying the key variables is essential to diagnosing the real causes of environmental deterioration and prescribing a treatment that will work. Speth acknowledges that much of the world is undergoing \u201cdematerialization,\u201d such that economic growth far outpaces increases in resource demand, but seems not to appreciate how the capitalist system he decries creates the incentives that drive this trend.  Were it not for market-driven advances in technological capability and ecological efficiency, humanity\u2019s footprint on the Earth would be far greater. While modern civilization has developed the means to effect massive ecological transformations, it has also found ways to produce wealth while leaving more of the natural world intact. Market competition generates substantial incentives to do more with less\u2014thus in market economies we see long and continuing improvements in productive efficiency. This can be seen everywhere from the replacement of copper with fiber optics (made from silica, the chief component in sand) and the light-weighting of packaging to the explosion of agricultural productivity and improvements in energy efficiency. Less material is used and disposed of, reducing overall environmental impacts from productive activity.  The key to such improvements is the same set of institutional arrangements that Speth so decries: property rights and voluntary exchange protected by the rule of law\u2014that is, capitalism. As research by Wheaton College economist Seth Norton and many others has shown, societies in which property rights and economic freedoms are protected experience superior economic and environmental performance than those societies subject to greater government control. Indeed, such institutions have a greater effect on environmental performance than the other factors, such as population growth, that occupy the attention of Speth and so many other environmental thinkers.  Speth complains that capitalism is fundamentally biased against the future; but the marketplace does a far better job of pricing and accounting for future interests than the political alternative. \u201cFuture generations cannot participate in capitalism\u2019s markets [today],\u201d says Speth. Fair enough, but they cannot vote or engage in the regulatory process either. Thus the relevant policy question is what set of institutions does the best\u2014or least bad\u2014job of accounting for such concerns, and here there is no contest.

In his most recent paper on the topic, he and co-author Carlos Seiglie of Rutgers University review the massive amount of research on trade, war, and peace. They find that \"the overwhelming evidence indicates that trade reduces conflict.\" Likewise for foreign investment. The greater the amounts that foreigners invest in the United States, or the more that Americans invest abroad, the lower is the likelihood of war between America and those countries with which it has investment relationships. Professors Polachek and Seiglie conclude that, \"The policy implication of our finding is that further international cooperation in reducing barriers to both trade and capital flows can promote a more peaceful world.\" Columbia University political scientist Erik Gartzke reaches a similar but more general conclusion: Peace is fostered by economic freedom. Economic freedom certainly includes, but is broader than, the freedom of ordinary people to trade internationally. It includes also low and transparent rates of taxation, the easy ability of entrepreneurs to start new businesses, the lightness of regulations on labor, product, and credit markets, ready access to sound money, and other factors that encourage the allocation of resources by markets rather than by government officials. Professor Gartzke ranks countries on an economic-freedom index from 1 to 10, with 1 being very unfree and 10 being very free. He then examines military conflicts from 1816 through 2000. His findings are powerful: Countries that rank lowest on an economic-freedom index - with scores of 2 or less - are 14 times more likely to be involved in military conflicts than are countries whose people enjoy significant economic freedom (that is, countries with scores of 8 or higher). Also important, the findings of Polachek and Gartzke improve our understanding of the long-recognized reluctance of democratic nations to wage war against one another. These scholars argue that the so-called democratic peace is really the capitalist peace. Democratic institutions are heavily concentrated in countries that also have strong protections for private property rights, openness to foreign commerce, and other features broadly consistent with capitalism. That's why the observation that any two democracies are quite unlikely to go to war against each other might reflect the consequences of capitalism more than democracy. And that's just what the data show. Polachek and Seiglie find that openness to trade is much more effective at encouraging peace than is democracy per se. Similarly, Gartzke discovered that, \"When measures of both economic freedom and democracy are included in a statistical study, economic freedom is about 50 times more effective than democracy in diminishing violent conflict.\" These findings make sense. By promoting prosperity, economic freedom gives ordinary people a large stake in peace. This prosperity is threatened during wartime. War almost always gives government more control over resources and imposes the burdens of higher taxes, higher inflation, and other disruptions of the everyday commercial relationships that support prosperity. When commerce reaches across political borders, the peace-promoting effects of economic freedom intensify. Why?

Free trade also encourages people and nations to live in peace with one another. Free trade raises the cost of war by making nations more economically interdependent. Free trade makes it more profitable for people of one nation to produce goods and services for people of another nation than to conquer them. By promoting communication across borders, trade increases understanding and reduces suspicion toward people in other countries. International trade creates a network of human contacts. Phone calls, emails, faxes and face-to-face meetings are an integral part of commercial relations between people of different nations. This human interaction encourages tolerance and respect between people of different cultures (if not toward protectionist politicians). Ancient writers, expounding what we now call the Universal Economy Doctrine, understood the link between trade and international harmony. The fourth-century writer Libanius declared in his Orations (III), \"God did not bestow all products upon all parts of the earth, but distributed His gifts over different regions, to the end that men might cultivate a social relationship because one would have need of the help of another. And so He called commerce into being, that all men might be able to have common enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, no matter where produced.\" Open trade makes war a less appealing option for governments by raising its costs. To a nation committed to free trade, war not only means the destruction of life and property. It is also terrible for business, disrupting international commerce and inflicting even greater hardship on the mass of citizens. When the door to trade is open, a nation's citizens can gain access to goods and resources outside their borders by offering in exchange what they themselves can produce relatively well. When the door is closed, the only way to gain access is through military conquest. As the 19th century Frenchman Frederic Bastiat said, \"When goods cannot cross borders, armies will.\" History demonstrates the peaceful influence of trade. The century of relative world peace from 1815 to 1914 was marked by a dramatic expansion of international trade, investment and human migration, illuminated by the example of Great Britain. In contrast, the rise of protectionism and the downward spiral of global trade in the 1930s aggravated the underlying hostilities that propelled Germany and Japan to make war on their neighbors. In the more than half a century since the end of World War II, no wars have been fought between two nations that were outwardly oriented in their trade policies.

They protest that international trade is environmentally destructive, because it induces the emergence of \"pollution-havens\"\u2014Third World nations that take on the dirty work of tanning leather, making paper, and the like. These nations become polluted and, it is claimed, total environmental damage also increases. Many economists are skeptical of the pollution-haven story, but the contention that trade harms the environment is difficult to assess systematically. The links between trade and the environment are subtle and complicated, and simply measuring such concepts in a convincing way is daunting. Recent research has made huge strides in cracking this problem and provides us with a compelling conclusion: Freer international trade improves the environment (Antweiler, Copeland, and Taylor 2001).  Whether it is between people, states, or nations, trade can have an impact on environmental quality through three channels. These are changes in (i) where goods are produced, (ii) the scale of economic activity, and (iii) the production techniques used. Antweiler et al. are able to distinguish the effects of each of these on environmental quality. Interestingly, changes in the location of production\u2014the pollution-haven hypothesis\u2014turn out to be empirically unimportant. The fact that freer trade induces increases in the scale of economic activity, on the other hand, has a modest adverse impact on environmental quality. But the third effect\u2014changes in production techniques\u2014swamps the other forces, and it is environmentally beneficial, not harmful. Overall, the authors estimate that for each one percent that freer trade raises per capita income in a nation, the result is that pollution (as measured by sulfur dioxide concentrations) falls by one percent. When trade expands, the composition of output from each nation changes because trading partners can now exploit their sources of comparative advantage\u2014doing more of what each does best and less of those things at which each is not very good. Anti-trade protestors have argued that comparative advantage moves dirty production processes to developing countries, polluting these nations and increasing overall environmental damage. What this claim misses is that a staggering array of factors help determine the location of productive activity.

Simply increasing the scale of economic activity means more material goods are produced, so more byproducts are formed, causing air and water pollution. This tends to reduce environmental quality. The authors find this effect clearly, albeit modestly, present in the data: Each one percent rise in economic activity induces about one-quarter of one percent rise in pollution concentrations due to this force. Overall, however, Antweiler et al. find that this negative effect is overwhelmed as economic growth, spurred by trade, takes place. When people get richer they demand more environmental amenities. As free trade expands, each one percent increase in per capita incomes tends to drive pollution concentrations down by 1.25 to 1.5 percent because of the movement to cleaner techniques of production. The conclusions one can draw from this research are limited in two dimensions. First, sulfur dioxide concentrations are the sole measure of pollution used in this paper, a fact driven simply by the need to select some measure. Free trade might worsen other measures of pollution, but sulfur dioxide concentrations are known to move closely with other airborne emissions. Hence, it seems unlikely that alternative measures of pollution would yield much different conclusions. Second, the authors do not investigate exactly what regulatory or institutional changes are driving the environmental improvement caused by rising incomes. In principle, the rising demand for environmental quality might get translated into environmental improvement through explicit government pollution abatement policy or through pollution-reducing changes in private contractual arrangements. The authors do not attempt to disentangle the relative roles of these two effects; they can, however, discern the combined effect. But the nature of these changes is clearly important in the debate over the efficacy of free market environmentalism. If rising incomes bring environmental improvement chiefly due to the growth of intrusive regulatory schemes, the environmentally beneficial effects are likely to be less appealing to many readers of this column. Still, there is little doubt about the quite conclusive finding of this research.

But, while aid increased and debts have been reduced in the interim, trade protectionism has become worse. The group had it backwards: Trade, not aid or debt forgiveness, is the key to Africa\u2019s success in the future. With the G8 currently meeting in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, a new vision of economic development must be embraced. Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region in the world. In 2007, according to World Bank data, the region\u2019s per-capita income was a mere $1,869. (The second-poorest region was South Asia with per capita income of $2,532.) Africa lags behind the rest of the world in most indicators of human well-being, including longevity, child mortality, nutrition and education. Over the last half-century, many development economists embraced the \u201cvicious cycle of poverty\u201d theory. Poverty in poor countries, the theory goes, impedes the accumulation of domestic savings. Low savings lead to low investment and low growth. But foreign aid can fill the \u201cgap\u201d between insufficient savings and the requisite investment for economic growth. The 2005 G8 summit gave that view a new impetus \u2014 the group agreed to double aid to Africa to $50-billion per year by 2010. But aid has failed to stimulate growth in Africa. Between 1975 and 2005, for example, per capita aid to Africa averaged $24.60 per year. By contrast, over the same period per capita aid in China and India averaged $1.50 and $2 respectively. The result: Chinese and Indian incomes rose by 888% and 174% respectively; but in Africa, incomes fell by 5%. The 2005 summit also \u201cagreed that all of the debts owed by eligible heavily indebted poor countries to the [international financial institutions] \u2026 should be cancelled.\u201d The effects of debt relief, however, remain unclear. A recently released study from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, for example, found that the \u201cimpact of debt relief on countries\u2019 poverty-reducing spending is unknown.\u201d Moreover, past debt relief did not put African countries on a firmer financial footing. Instead, it led to yet more wasteful government borrowing that necessitated more debt relief. Thus, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund\u2019s Debt Relief Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) in 1996 was followed by the enhanced HIPC initiative in 1999 and then by the creation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in 2005. There is a general consensus among economists that free trade, accompanied by institutional and policy reforms, leads to higher rates of growth. According to a World Bank paper, \u201cmoving to free global merchandise trade would boost real incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa proportionately more than in other developing countries or in high-income countries.\u201d Unfortunately, Africa remains one of the most protectionist regions in the world. Between the late-1980s and 2007, for example, average applied tariffs in the developing world declined from 26.1% to 9.8%. In Africa, however, they only fell from 26.6% to a still-high 13.1%. The G8 can help Africa integrate with the rest of the world by eliminating restrictions on African exports and ending farm subsidies. But, the group should also recognize that its heavy emphasis on aid and debt relief make foreign actions appear to be chiefly responsible for poverty alleviation in Africa. In fact, the main obstacles to economic growth in Africa rest with Africa\u2019s policies and institutions, such as trade protectionism and weak protection of property rights. In L\u2019Aquila, the choice is between endorsing failed policies of the past and creating a new consensus on development. The G8 should realize that aid and debt forgiveness have not led to growth in Africa, while trade liberalization has contributed to prosperity in the rest of the world."], "id": "8433841b19293d43c1ab36474eb17d4c30fbe3ed93d967533d139e4614a1835b", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 257, 338], [2, 809, 1001], [2, 2485, 2661]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[10, 14], [111, 113]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2009-07-08"}, {"tag": "Free trade solves poverty \u2013 South America proves", "cite": "Joachim Bamrud, Editor-in-chief of Latin Business Chronicle, 8/3/05, \u201cFree Trade and Poverty,\u201d Latin Business Chronicle, http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=6092", "body": ["", "Despite the increase, Chavez is actively pursuing an alternative for his own country and the rest of Latin America: Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), meant to compete with the US-initiated Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

Critics need to rethink how we can help Colombia continue its positive momentum. The agreement has provisions to bolster both the supply and demand for good governance. Here's how: First, the free trade agreement encourages public participation in trade policymaking. Citizens in both countries gain the right to challenge trade rules. Second, the agreement gives Colombian workers the right to petition the U.S. government to take action. If the Colombian government is found to have violated labor provisions, it may lose trade benefits. In this regard, the agreement is both a carrot and a stick.

Many people, including U.S. President George W. Bush, hope that spreading democracy will discourage war. But new research suggests that expanding free markets is a far more important factor, leading to what Columbia University's Erik Gartzke calls a \"capitalist peace.\" It's a reason for even the left to support free markets.  The capitalist peace theory isn't new: Montesquieu and Adam Smith believed in it. Many of Britain's classical liberals, such as Richard Cobden, pushed free markets while opposing imperialism.  But World War I demonstrated that increased trade was not enough. The prospect of economic ruin did not prevent rampant nationalism, ethnic hatred, and security fears from trumping the power of markets.  An even greater conflict followed a generation later. Thankfully, World War II left war essentially unthinkable among leading industrialized - and democratic - states. Support grew for the argument, going back to Immanual Kant, that republics are less warlike than other systems.  Today's corollary is that creating democracies out of dictatorships will reduce conflict. This contention animated some support outside as well as inside the United States for the invasion of Iraq.  But Gartzke argues that \"the 'democratic peace' is a mirage created by the overlap between economic and political freedom.\" That is, democracies typically have freer economies than do authoritarian states.  Thus, while \"democracy is desirable for many reasons,\" he notes in a chapter in the latest volume of Economic Freedom in the World, created by the Fraser Institute, \"representative governments are unlikely to contribute directly to international peace.\" Capitalism is by far the more important factor.  The shift from statist mercantilism to high-tech capitalism has transformed the economics behind war. Markets generate economic opportunities that make war less desirable. Territorial aggrandizement no longer provides the best path to riches.  Free-flowing capital markets and other aspects of globalization simultaneously draw nations together and raise the economic price of military conflict. Moreover, sanctions, which interfere with economic prosperity, provides a coercive step short of war to achieve foreign policy ends.  Positive economic trends are not enough to prevent war, but then, neither is democracy. It long has been obvious that democracies are willing to fight, just usually not each other. Contends Gartzke, \"liberal political systems, in and of themselves, have no impact on whether states fight.\"  In particular, poorer democracies perform like non-democracies. He explains: \"Democracy does not have a measurable impact, while nations with very low levels of economic freedom are 14 times more prone to conflict than those with very high levels.\"  Gartzke considers other variables, including alliance memberships, nuclear deterrence, and regional differences.  Although the causes of conflict vary, the relationship between economic liberty and peace remains.  His conclusion hasn't gone unchallenged. Author R.J. Rummel, an avid proponent of the democratic peace theory, challenges Gartzke's methodology and worries that it \"may well lead intelligent and policy-wise analysts and commentators to draw the wrong conclusions about the importance of democratization.\"  Gartzke responds in detail, noting that he relied on the same data as most democratic peace theorists. If it is true that democratic states don't go to war, then it also is true that \"states with advanced free market economies never go to war with each other, either.\"  The point is not that democracy is valueless. Free political systems naturally entail free elections and are more likely to protect other forms of liberty - civil and economic, for instance.  However, democracy alone doesn't yield peace. To believe is does is dangerous: There's no panacea for creating a conflict-free world.  That doesn't mean that nothing can be done. But promoting open international markets - that is, spreading capitalism - is the best means to encourage peace as well as prosperity.  Notes Gartzke: \"Warfare among developing nations will remain unaffected by the capitalist peace as long as the economies of many developing countries remain fettered by governmental control.\" Freeing those economies is critical.  It's a particularly important lesson for the anti-capitalist left. For the most part, the enemies of economic liberty also most stridently denounce war, often in near-pacifist terms. Yet they oppose the very economic policies most likely to encourage peace.  If market critics don't realize the obvious economic and philosophical value of markets - prosperity and freedom - they should appreciate the unintended peace dividend. Trade encourages prosperity and stability; technological innovation reduces the financial value of conquest; globalization creates economic interdependence, increasing the cost of war.  Nothing is certain in life, and people are motivated by far more than economics. But it turns out that peace is good business. And capitalism is good for peace.

But he does not understand the system he wants to reform, let alone what he would substitute in its place.  According to Speth, \u201cmost environmental deterioration is a result of systemic failures of capitalism.\u201d This is an odd claim, as the least capitalist nations of the world also have the worst environmental records. The ecological costs of economic statism are far worse than those of economic liberty. The environmental record of the various Soviet regimes amply bears this out: The West\u2019s ecological nightmares were the Soviet bloc\u2019s environmental realities. This is not due to any anomaly of the Soviet system. Nations with greater commitment to capitalist institutions experience greater environmental performance.  While Speth occasionally acknowledges pockets of environmental progress, he hardly stops to consider the reasons why some environmental resources have been conserved more effectively than others. Fisheries are certainly declining throughout much of the world\u2014some 75 percent of fisheries are fully or over-exploited\u2014but not everywhere. It is worth asking why. Tropical forests in less-developed nations are declining even as most temperate forests in industrialized nations are rebounding. Recognizing these different trends and identifying the key variables is essential to diagnosing the real causes of environmental deterioration and prescribing a treatment that will work. Speth acknowledges that much of the world is undergoing \u201cdematerialization,\u201d such that economic growth far outpaces increases in resource demand, but seems not to appreciate how the capitalist system he decries creates the incentives that drive this trend.  Were it not for market-driven advances in technological capability and ecological efficiency, humanity\u2019s footprint on the Earth would be far greater. While modern civilization has developed the means to effect massive ecological transformations, it has also found ways to produce wealth while leaving more of the natural world intact. Market competition generates substantial incentives to do more with less\u2014thus in market economies we see long and continuing improvements in productive efficiency. This can be seen everywhere from the replacement of copper with fiber optics (made from silica, the chief component in sand) and the light-weighting of packaging to the explosion of agricultural productivity and improvements in energy efficiency. Less material is used and disposed of, reducing overall environmental impacts from productive activity.  The key to such improvements is the same set of institutional arrangements that Speth so decries: property rights and voluntary exchange protected by the rule of law\u2014that is, capitalism. As research by Wheaton College economist Seth Norton and many others has shown, societies in which property rights and economic freedoms are protected experience superior economic and environmental performance than those societies subject to greater government control. Indeed, such institutions have a greater effect on environmental performance than the other factors, such as population growth, that occupy the attention of Speth and so many other environmental thinkers.  Speth complains that capitalism is fundamentally biased against the future; but the marketplace does a far better job of pricing and accounting for future interests than the political alternative. \u201cFuture generations cannot participate in capitalism\u2019s markets [today],\u201d says Speth. Fair enough, but they cannot vote or engage in the regulatory process either. Thus the relevant policy question is what set of institutions does the best\u2014or least bad\u2014job of accounting for such concerns, and here there is no contest. However present-oriented the marketplace may be, it is better able to look past the next election cycle than any plausibly democratic alternative."], "id": "c80f31a838252c67d4eb375552b7212a52d2b479fe6acb1d2489ec7e245dfb01", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 124, 170], [2, 333, 351], [2, 436, 631], [2, 710, 790], [2, 844, 947], [2, 1146, 1179], [2, 1266, 1284], [2, 1310, 1438], [2, 1438, 1439], [2, 1627, 1645], [2, 1645, 1645], [2, 1646, 1650], [2, 1650, 1650], [2, 1651, 2033], [2, 2220, 2292], [2, 2384, 2460], [2, 2460, 2460], [2, 2509, 2767], [2, 2854, 2921], [2, 3003, 3191]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[9, 15], [151, 153]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2008-01-01"}, {"tag": "", "cite": "Rory Carroll, The Guardian, \u201cThe Temples of Doom\u201d, 10-23-2008, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/28/climatechange-population", "body": ["Recent events have injected a jarring note into Mayan studies: a sense of anxiety, even foreboding. Serious people are asking a question that at first sounds ridiculous. What if the fate of the Maya is to be our fate? What if climate change and the global financial crisis are harbingers of a system that is destined to warp, buckle and collapse?  No one is suggesting that vines will start crawling up the concrete canyons of Wall Street, or that howler monkeys will chase pin-striped bankers through Manhattan. Mayan kings who screwed up were ritually tortured and sacrificed with the aid of stingray spines to pierce the penis; an emphatic application of moral hazard. In our era, the only thing slashed is a bonus.  There are, however, striking parallels between the Maya fall and our era's convulsions. \"We think we are different,\" says Jared Diamond, the American evolutionary biologist. \"In fact . . . all of those powerful societies of the past thought that they too were unique, right up to the moment of their collapse.\" The Maya, like us, were at the apex of their power when things began to unravel, he says. As stock markets zigzag into uncharted territory and ice caps continue to melt, it is a view increasingly echoed by scholars and commentators.  What, then, is the story of the Maya? And what lessons does it hold for us? According to Diamond's thesis, this: the ancients built a very clever and advanced society but were undone by their own success. Populations grew and stretched natural resources to breaking point. Political elites failed to resolve the escalating economic problems and the system collapsed. There was no need for an external cataclysm or a plague. What did for the Maya was a slow-boiling environmental-driven crisis that its leaders failed to recognise and resolve until too late.  \"Because peak population, wealth, resource consumption, and waste production are accompanied by peak environmental impact - approaching the limit at which impact outstrips resources - we can now understand why declines of societies tend to follow swiftly on their peaks,\" wrote Diamond in a 2003 article, The Last Americans: Environmental Collapse and the End of Civilization. The idea is expanded in his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The link between environmental, economic and political stress is clear, says Diamond. \"When people are desperate and undernourished, they blame their government, which they see as responsible for failing to solve their problems.\"  A visit to the jungle ruins in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, stretching from southern Mexico down to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Belize, is a humbling experience. There is sticky, sapping heat and squadrons of biting, stinging mosquitoes. The Maya were not a homogenous empire like the Inca or Aztecs but a series of squabbling kingdoms. The first settlements have been dated back to 1800BC but what is known as the \"classic\" period started much later, around AD250. The final period - zenith and collapse between AD750 and AD900 - is known as the \"terminal classic\".  Tikal, deep in the forest of Pet\u00e9n in northern Guatemala, was one of the Mayan capitals, a sprawling complex of limestone structures that was home to up to 100,000 people. Kings doubled up as head priests and political leaders. There were acropolises with hieroglyphs and pyramids with flat roofs from which astronomers and mathematicians mapped the planets and calculated calendars.  The Maya accomplished all this without pack animals - no cows, mules or horses to heave and push, just human muscle - and with limited water, which forced reliance on rainfall. By AD750 there were several million in the region, most of them farmers. Monuments and palaces became ever grander as kings and nobles competed for glory. And then everything went pear-shaped. Archaeological records show monument building abruptly stopped, as did the boastful inscriptions. There is evidence that palaces may have been burned.  Most dramatically, the population vanished. Over a few generations numbers withered from millions to tens of thousands, maybe even just thousands. Most abandoned the cities and migrated north. The birth rates of those who stayed tumbled. (Mathematically, Russia's population decline is on a similar trajectory). By the time Spaniards clanked into southern Yucat\u00e1n in the 1500s there was hardly anyone left. Today, lush vegetation has reclaimed Tikal, turning everything mossy and green, but the temples, the tallest pre-Columbine structures, rise high over the canopy. George Lucas used Tikal as the site for the rebel base in the first Star Wars film.  To explain the mysterious collapse some scholars posit an invasion, or disease, or shifting trade routes, or a drought. There is wide agreement, however, that a leading cause was environmental pressure. \"The carrying capacity of the ecosystem was pushed to its limits,\" says Marcello Canuto, an anthropology professor at Yale. Lakes became silted and soils exhausted. Tilling and man-made reservoirs provided more food and water but population growth outstripped technological innovation.  Complex and organised it may have been but Mayan society resembled a frog who stays in slowly boiling water, says Canuto. \"Things were brewing within the system that were not picked up until too late.\" When the political elites did react they made things worse by offering greater sacrifices to the gods and plundering neighbours. \"The kingdoms were interdependent and there was a ripple effect. They did not respond correctly to a crisis which, in hindsight, was as clear as day.\"  The environmental trouble built up over centuries and was partly concealed by short-term fluctuations in rainfall patterns and harvest yields. But when the tipping point came, events moved quickly. \"Their success was built on very thin ice. Kings were supposed to keep order and avoid chaos through rituals and sacrifice,\" says David Webster, author of The Fall of the Ancient Maya. \"When manifestly they couldn't do it people lost confidence and the whole system of kingship fell apart.\"  Which brings us to modern parallels. Webster, watching the season's first snowflakes through the window of his office at Pennsylvania State University, has been waiting for the question. Pinned to his wall is an old clipping about the fall of Enron Corporation in 2001. \"That was the first tremor,\" he muses. \"You know, human beings are always surprised when things collapse just when they seem most successful. We look around and we think we're fat, we're clever, we're comfortable and we don't think we're on the edge of something nasty. Hubris? No: ignorance.\"  Some anthropologists hesitate to make direct links between ancient and modern societies, deeming it out of academic bounds. Not Webster. \"In common with the Maya, we're not very rational in how we think about how the world works. They had their rituals and sacrifices. Magic, in other words. And we also believe in magic: that money and innovation can get us out of the inherent limits of our system, that the old rules don't apply to us.\" He snorts.  This is a modish view these days but it was considered cranky luddism back during the 1980s stockmarket boom and the 1990s dotcom bubble. That was when masters of the universe bestrode Wall Street and Francis Fukuyama caught the triumphalist liberal economic zeitgeist with his book The End of History and the Last Man. That era, to borrow from Star Wars, feels a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Now Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are history and governments are taking over banks and propping up markets.  If traders and their mumbo jumbo about securitisation and derivatives resemble Mayan priests chanting in their temples then Bush and Gordon Brown are the hapless kings who egged them on rather than query the \"magic\". As chancellor, Brown blessed the conjuring. \"In budget after budget I want us to do even more to encourage the risk-takers,\" he said in 2004. Now the frailty is revealed and instead of Gordon Gekko's \"greed is good\" we are hearing Shelley's Ozymandias: \"Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.\"  Canuto sees an unhappy precedent. The Mayan kings who allowed their era's crisis to spin out of control were unfit to remedy it, not least because they were invested in the broken system. \"The ones who caused the crisis are the ones you don't want trying to resolve it.\" Bush, by coincidence of timing, is on his way out but Britain's prime minister and other G8 leaders are hanging on.  Several commentators have argued that the financial crisis is but a squall compared with the ecological hurricane they say is coming. A European study estimates deforestation alone is causing a loss of natural capital worth between $2 trillion and $5tn annually. \"The two crises have the same cause,\" wrote George Monbiot in the Guardian earlier this month. \"In both cases, those who exploit the resource have demanded impossible rates of return and invoked debts that can never be repaid. In both cases we denied the likely consequences.\" With ecology the stock from which all wealth grows, the financial and environmental crises feed each other, says Monbiot.  If so, the Maya offer an ominous glimpse of what may lie in store. \"Their population growth was like driving a car faster and faster until the engine blew up,\" says Webster, the anthropologist. \"Look at us. I'm 65. When I was born there were two billion people in the world, now we're approaching seven billion. That's extraordinary.\" Eventually pressure on scarce resources will overwhelm technology - and do for us as it did for the Maya. \"The western conceit is that we can have it all - and call it progress,\" says Webster. His voice drops. \"I'm glad I'm not 30 years old. I don't want to see what's coming in the next 40 to 50 years.\"  Armageddon, like hemlines, is prone to changes in fashion. It has been on a roll with films such as 28 Days Later, I Am Legend and Blindness, which posit a world grimmer than anything Hobbes envisaged. Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel, The Road, was hailed as an environmental fable. \"By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp,\" he writes, before introducing baby-skewering cannibals. That too is being made into a film. Webster does not think things will get that bad. \"Not like Mad Max,\" he says, managing to sound almost cheery. \"But definitely unpleasant.\"  The gloom may be misplaced. Reports of capitalism's death have been exaggerated before and it has stubbornly survived Karl Marx, the Great Depression, world wars and oil shocks. And in contrast to the Maya, it is possible our technology will prevail over population and environmental pressures. Malthusian doomsayers have consistently underestimated the capacity of better irrigation, pesticides, new strains of crops and other technologies to boost food yields. The rate of population growth is slowing and human numbers are expected to peak at around 9.2 billion by 2050 before declining. That Asians are moving more and more to western-type diets and consumer baubles will strain resources, acknowledges the Economist. But don't worry: \"There is no limit to human ingenuity.\"  If the gloomy environmental prognosis is correct, and global warming is set to wreak major havoc, what are the chances we will respond better than the Maya? Electing Bush instead of Al Gore suggests limited wisdom in picking kings, and emasculating the Kyoto treaty was perhaps as sensible as burning corn harvests to appease the gods. When Republicans chant, \"Drill, baby, drill!\" it is not much of a stretch to picture them, barefoot and in traditional huipil shirts, rooting for another sacrifice.  Nevertheless there are promising omens. Governments are beginning to assign monetary values to natural \"assets\" such as forests, a conceptual leap that could reinvent economics. The EU has set up a carbon-trading market to get industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The UN is pushing for a new climate treaty in which governments will pay tropical countries billions of dollars annually to leave their forests untouched. Ecuador has already requested $350m a year in exchange for leaving 1bn barrels of oil beneath its Amazon floor. \"I believe the 21st century will be dominated by the concept of natural capital, just as the 20th was dominated by financial capital,\" says Achim Steiner, head of the UN environment programme.", "", "", "", ""], "id": "e6d377595196cd23666ff29c6cf05064d060d74227b628336f07a8a221119200", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[2, 170, 345], [2, 10544, 10661], [2, 10667, 10720], [2, 10766, 11086], [2, 11086, 11086], [2, 11109, 11133], [2, 11283, 11322], [2, 11422, 11434], [2, 11434, 11434], [2, 11435, 11479], [2, 11866, 12003], [2, 12003, 12003], [2, 12095, 12247], [2, 12247, 12248], [2, 12363, 12501], [2, 12501, 12501], [2, 12502, 12507], [2, 12507, 12507], [2, 12508, 12553], [2, 12553, 12554]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[5, 13], [59, 61]], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2008-10-23"}, {"tag": "Polizeros.com, 6-14-2K7", "cite": "(Politics in the Zeroes, \u201cWhy capitalism can\u2019t solve global warming\u201d, http://polizeros.com/2007/06/14/why-capitalism-cant-solve-global-warming/, Damien REQ) ", "body": ["There are three major barriers against capitalism achieving the goal of reducing co2 emissions.

Thirty years ago, the combined incomes of the richest fifth of the world\u2019s population were 30 times greater than those of the poorest fifth. Today, their incomes are over 60 times greater. With joint assets of $762 billion, just 358 billionaires now own more than the combined annual income of the world\u2019s poorest two billion people. Moreover the gap between rich and poor is widening, in large part, according to the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), due to the uneven impacts of globalisation  inequalities which UNCTAD believes could cause major social upheavals.90In the \"transitional economies\" of Central and Eastern Europe and of the former Soviet Union, for example, globalisation has brought: \"growing income inequality and conjunctural poverty, even as liberalisation policies foster private entrepreneurship and bolster the prospects of structural change leading to sustained economic growth.\"91 According to World Bank estimates, the number of absolute poor in the economies of Eastern Europe and Central Asia grew from 2.2 million in 1987 to 14.5 million, or 3.5 per cent of the population, in 1993.92This increase, notes UNCTAD, \"has been due to the erosion of real wages and entitlements in recent years\".93The Bank reports a similar picture for East Asia, where despite strong growth rates, more than two-thirds of people still lived in poverty, and inequality was increasing even before the 1997 economic crash.94 In Central and Latin America, too, inequality and poverty have accompanied liberalisation. Although the percentage of the population in absolute poverty in Latin America as a whole fell during the early 1990s, the numbers are again on the increase.95A recent study concludes that \"the new economic model has done little to improve poverty and has a tendency to harm income distribution\".96 Indeed, \"real minimum wages fell substantially in almost all countries as local industries adapted to increased competition from imports\".97In Mexico, between 1989 and 1992, the richest 5 per cent of the population increased its share of income from 24 per cent to 29 per cent of the total, while the income of the poorest 5 per cent fell from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent.98 Globalisation and liberalisation have also increased regional inequality. Job creation increasingly relies on inward investment, so the pattern of inward investment determines whether or not people have jobs and what kind of jobs are on offer. Firms seeking to reduce labour costs, for example, tend to relocate to areas where labour is cheapest; firms seeking to establish retail outlets, to those areas where incomes are highest. Such inward investment reinforces existing regional disparities.

Low-paid workers in these countries work under hazardous conditions to salvage valuable materials from this fast-growing waste stream, while polluting the soil, air and water in the process. These recent examples heighten the concern that developing countries, where the bulk of the world\u2019s population lives, may be unprepared for the environmental consequences of global trade. Studies of air quality show that it deteriorates in the early stages of economic growth, and then starts improving when per-capita income exceeds $5000 per year. If this holds for most kinds of pollution and resource depletion, then incomes will have to increase by a factor of five to ten in large developing countries like China and India before there is sufficient local demand for environmental protection. Assuming that free trade can eventually deliver this income growth, a big unknown is whether it will result in income-induced policy changes before the cost of cleaning up the environment becomes prohibitively high. Equally troublesome is the issue of trans-boundary pollution such as greenhouse-gas emissions, where countries with widely different income levels will have to come together with a unified policy response. Between 1973 and 2001, a period in which many domestic economies were turned inside out by globalization, annual carbon-dioxide emissions from worldwide fuel combustion increased by 50 percent. By 2030, these emissions are projected to be 60 percent higher than in 2001 if no new policies are adopted. Power generation and transportation -- two sectors crucial to trade -- will account for three-quarters of this increase. A great deal of uncertainty remains about the long-term environmental impacts of globalization. But the evidence we have so far suggests that free trade unconstrained by environmental protection could be a recipe for disaster.

Leadership elites drawn from domestic-oriented, uncompetitive, or non-tradable constituencies will tend to discount deterrent signals sent by trading partners whose own domestic institutions favor those commerce-oriented interests, believing such interests make partners less likely to fulfill their threats.

Sometimes, deterrent signals may not be sent at all, since one nation's governing coalition may include commerce-dependent groups whose interests prevent state leaders from actually undertaking necessary balancing responses or issuing potent signals of resolve in the first place; the result can be fatally muddled strategy and even war -- as witness the series of weak attempts before the First World War by finance-dominated Britain to deter \"Iron and Rye\"-dominated Germany.", ""], "id": "ef44364ddd9cc6cccfcf742e29f5fbcd9f178d6f33ff8a715eadc5e362c20965", "highlighted_text": "", "highlights": [], "underlines": [[3, 143, 256], [3, 352, 639], [3, 1321, 1787]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "Mega LD Backfile Part 2 Imapcts Calculus Malthus Cap copy.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2007-11-24"}, {"tag": "Free trade doesn\u2019t solve war \u2013 based upon a false assumption, violence is inherent", "cite": "Richard M.

We need to better understand that each state is absolutely sovereign and they have never surrendered that sovereignty. Accordingly, any one state or group of states may exercise that sovereignty by negating any unconstitutional act, regulation, or order of the general government \u2014 whether positively through acts of nullification or negatively through refusing to obey or enforce those acts. Neither of those approaches to nullification requires a coalition of states to be effective. In fact, such a requirement of multi-state collaboration in this check on the general government usurpations would diminish the sovereignty of the individual state. Such a requirement would reduce the single state to temporary sovereign status, sovereign only in those instances when it agrees to join some provisional confederacy of other states opposing this or that act of the general government. Ironically, perhaps, if a plurality (or a majority) of states nullified the same act or edict of one of the branches of the central government, the union would be strengthened by such a concerted commitment to the Constitution and the foundational principle of enumerated powers. Think of it this way: how much safer, cleaner, and attractive would a neighborhood be if the homeowners consistently enforced the terms of the covenant that created the Homeowners\u2019 Association? Federalism is a delicate flower that grows best when planted in the rich soil of constitutional consistency. But that plot of land has lain fallow for so long and the weeds of centralism have grown so tall, that there are few legislators or laymen who remember the fertile, loamy soil that once nourished abundant acre upon abundant acre of the life-giving harvest of liberty. Today, federalism is not only misunderstood, but misapplied by those who claim to appreciate its qualities. For example, so often so-called \u201cconservatives\u201d will push back against the aggression of the federal government until the feds win (and they always do), and then the former foes retreat to safety behind the lines of the Supremacy Clause. State legislators who consider themselves lawmakers per se, that is to say, not proxies for their colleagues on Capitol Hill, could foment real revolution without ever firing a shot and without ever filing a bill. Nullification, whether exercised by one state or many, is a fact of constitutional construction and does not require a bill to trigger its protections of state sovereignty and individual liberty. States which refuse to enforce an unconstitutional federal edict nullify that act just as positively and permanently as a state that proposes and passes a law negating that same measure. After establishing a record of reliable resistance to attempts by the federal government to exercise unconstitutional powers, citizens of a state or group of states that effectively ignore the offending counterfeit law would learn in a generation or two that there are just some things that the federal government can\u2019t do. That state (or states) would gradually gain a gravitational pull, attracting men and women who value liberty above devotion to a \u201cunion\u201d that has long since ceased to abide by the terms of the contract that created it and had grown so gargantuan as to prevent the justice and liberty it was organized to preserve. Sadly, state lawmakers and governors have thus far failed to appreciate the right and responsibility they have to build these bulwarks of freedom. Perhaps more pragmatically relevant, they have failed to understand the amount of money that would be pumped into state budgets by a constant stream of immigrants (from within the union) seeking to be free from the crushing weight of federal mandates and monetary manipulation. When the first state assembly or the first state chief executive catches the vision of the viability and economic worth of a state where the Constitution is rigidly adhered to, there will be an immediate response by other states seeking to emulate that state\u2019s success.

We use the Levy Institute macroeconometric model to estimate the impact of three versions of such an unconditional cash assistance program over an eight-year time horizon. Overall, we find that the economy can not only withstand large increases in federal spending, but could also grow thanks to the stimulative effects of cash transfers on the economy.", "We examine three versions of unconditional cash transfers: $1,000 a month to all adults, $500 a month to all adults, and a $250 a month child allowance. For each of the three versions, we model the macroeconomic effects of these transfers using two different financing plans - increasing the federal debt, or fully funding the increased spending with increased taxes on households - and compare the effects to the Levy model\u2019s baseline growth rate forecast. Our findings include the following:", "\uf0b7 For all three designs, enacting a UBI and paying for it by increasing the federal debt would grow the economy. Under the smallest spending scenario, $250 per month for each child, GDP is 0.79% larger than under the baseline forecast after eight years. According to the Levy Model, the largest cash program - $1,000 for all adults annually - expands the economy by 12.56% [percent] over the baseline after eight years. After eight years of enactment, the stimulative effects of the program dissipate and GDP growth returns to the baseline forecast, but the level of output remains permanently higher.", "\uf0b7 When paying for the policy by increasing taxes on households, the Levy model forecasts no effect on the economy. In effect, it gives to households with one hand what it is takes away with the other.", "\uf0b7 However, when the model is adapted to include distributional effects, the economy grows, even in the tax-financed scenarios. This occurs because the distributional model incorporates the idea that an extra dollar in the hands of lower income households leads to higher spending. In other words, the households that pay more in taxes than they receive in cash assistance have a low propensity to consume, and those that receive more in assistance than they pay in taxes have a high propensity to consume. Thus, even when the policy is tax- rather than debt-financed, there is an increase in output, employment, prices, and wages.", "Levy\u2019s Keynesian model incorporates a series of assumptions based on rigorous empirical studies of the micro and macro effects of unconditional cash transfers, taxation and government net spending and borrowing (see Marinescu (2017), Mason (2017), Coibion et al (2017), and Konczal and Steinbaum (2016)). Fundamentally, the larger the size of the UBI, the larger the increase in aggregate demand and thus the larger the resulting economy is. The individual macroeconomic indicators are (qualitatively) what one would predict given an increase in aggregate demand: in addition to the increase in output, employment, labor force participation, prices, and wages all go up as well. Even in a deficit-financed policy, an increase in the government\u2019s liabilities is mitigated by the increase in aggregate demand.

First, it is not clear that breaking up and regulating big tech would prevent those firms from having the considerable resources to develop the technologies of the future. Facebook would still have billions of users, even without Instagram and WhatsApp, for example. Amazon\u2019s platform would still have enormous market power.", "Second, and more importantly, part of the answer is that the decision to break up and regulate tech companies should be accompanied by public investment in R&D. One of the primary arguments for the national champions view is that monopolists have the resources to be able to invest in innovation because they do not face competitive pressures. 65. Baker, supra note 58, at 578 (describing the Schumpeterian view and linking it to R&D capacity).But any system of innovation operates against a backdrop of laws and public policy. 66. Some scholars have suggested that resolution to the Schumpeter-Arrow debate depends on an industry-by-industry assessment. See, e.g., Mark A. Lemley, Industry-Specific Antitrust Policy for Innovation, 3 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 637, 651\u201352 (2011). But it is not clear that industry-by-industry assessments on antitrust enforcement alone can resolve this debate. Industries operate under different policy background conditions \u2014 including, for example, intellectual property rules, industrial policy, and R&D funding\u2014and it may be that the optimal path is for policymakers to revisit policy choices in multiple areas.The ability to capture the gains of innovation depends on intellectual property law. The possibility of winning government contracts for frontier projects that require innovation is determined by procurement policies. And, of course, an alternative to monopolist investment in R&D is public investment in R&D. These policy choices all shape the innovation ecosystem, and it is not at all obvious why society has to accept national champions instead of thinking about revising these laws and policies more broadly. Given the emphasis that proponents of national champions place on research and development, it is worth noting that historically, as Mariana Mazzucato has argued, government has been a significant driver of innovation through its research and development efforts. 67. Mariana Mazzucato, The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths (2013).Today, one could easily imagine the government spending considerable sums of money on R&D in artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing, augmented and virtual reality, and other technological research.", "Public investment in research has a variety of benefits. First, because it is not tied to the profit motive and business model of a single company, it covers a wider range of subjects, leading potentially to innovations that would otherwise go undiscovered. Public investment extends to basic research that does not have immediate or foreseeable commercial applications. It could also include research into areas that might challenge the incumbency and business models of existing companies.", "", ""], "id": "e73d0b2c2a15bef36291a94d51c298771c1715aa9ca3ab01f0571975311cae56", "highlighted_text": " robotics, AI, and quantum are so resource-intensive that smaller companies mean no company have resources to invest answer is public R&D. government has been driver of innovation through r and d Public investment is not tied to profit covers wider range of subjects leading to innovations otherwise undiscovered .", "highlights": [[2, 22, 47], [2, 58, 88], [2, 105, 122], [2, 159, 163], [2, 169, 179], [2, 186, 190], [2, 195, 204], [2, 215, 217], [2, 218, 224], [3, 42, 51], [3, 135, 141], [3, 156, 160], [3, 1820, 1839], [3, 1854, 1860], [3, 1861, 1863], [3, 1864, 1874], [3, 1875, 1882], [3, 1887, 1888], [3, 1896, 1901], [4, 0, 17], [4, 75, 77], [4, 78, 86], [4, 87, 89], [4, 94, 100], [4, 151, 157], [4, 160, 171], [4, 172, 183], [4, 185, 192], [4, 205, 219], [4, 231, 240], [4, 244, 256], [4, 256, 257]], "underlines": [[2, 22, 47], [2, 48, 57], [2, 58, 88], [2, 89, 104], [2, 105, 122], [2, 123, 152], [2, 159, 163], [2, 164, 168], [2, 169, 179], [2, 180, 185], [2, 186, 190], [2, 191, 194], [2, 195, 204], [2, 205, 214], [2, 215, 217], [2, 218, 224], [2, 224, 224], [2, 225, 227], [2, 234, 242], [2, 250, 254], [3, 12, 28], [3, 38, 41], [3, 42, 51], [3, 52, 81], [3, 100, 119], [3, 132, 134], [3, 135, 141], [3, 156, 160], [3, 1820, 1839], [3, 1840, 1841], [3, 1854, 1860], [3, 1861, 1863], [3, 1864, 1874], [3, 1875, 1882], [3, 1883, 1886], [3, 1887, 1888], [3, 1896, 1901], [3, 1912, 1920], [3, 2027, 2036], [3, 2037, 2051], [3, 2052, 2075], [3, 2076, 2093], [3, 2094, 2112], [3, 2113, 2114], [3, 2124, 2125], [3, 2138, 2146], [3, 2148, 2165], [4, 0, 17], [4, 64, 74], [4, 75, 77], [4, 78, 86], [4, 87, 89], [4, 90, 93], [4, 94, 100], [4, 101, 107], [4, 151, 157], [4, 158, 159], [4, 160, 171], [4, 172, 183], [4, 185, 192], [4, 205, 219], [4, 220, 230], [4, 231, 240], [4, 241, 243], [4, 244, 256], [4, 256, 257], [4, 258, 275], [4, 276, 286], [4, 287, 306], [4, 307, 315], [4, 316, 320], [4, 334, 373], [4, 385, 401], [4, 413, 417], [4, 424, 433], [4, 438, 448], [4, 462, 471], [4, 472, 490], [4, 490, 491]], "emphasis": [[2, 169, 179], [2, 195, 204], [2, 218, 224], [2, 224, 224], [2, 234, 242], [3, 12, 28], [3, 135, 141], [3, 1854, 1860], [3, 1864, 1874], [3, 1887, 1888], [3, 1896, 1901], [3, 2037, 2051], [3, 2076, 2093], [3, 2113, 2114], [3, 2124, 2125], [3, 2138, 2146], [3, 2148, 2165], [4, 78, 86], [4, 94, 100], [4, 101, 107], [4, 160, 171], [4, 231, 240], [4, 241, 243], [4, 244, 256], [4, 307, 315], [4, 424, 433], [4, 472, 490]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9], [10, 12]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2020-01-30"}, {"tag": "Counterplan juices growth, productivity, and jobs.", "cite": "Johnson & Gruber 19 (Simon Johnson is the Ronald A.

Based on history and available evidence, this investment would lead to a significant growth boost, arising from more invention and faster productivity growth.18", "The evidence reviewed in Chapter 5 shows that past expansions of public R&D have been a cost-effective way to increase employment. On the high end, our own regression estimates of the impact of more university R&D funding on jobs suggest that university research spending raises employment at a cost of $28,000 per job, while the study of the New Zealand public R&D program increasing employment implies a cost per job of $29,000.19 On the lower end, the study of the Finnish Tekes program implies a cost per job of $8,100, while the study of military R&D in Europe suggests a cost per job created of only $2,100. This entire range is quite low, relative to what it costs to create jobs in other contexts. For example, existing estimates of the jobs created by stimulus spending in the Great Recession suggested a cost per job created of about $50,000.20", "If we conservatively assume that expansions of research and development create one additional job per $25,000 in spending, then an investment of $100 billion per year would create four million good new jobs.

Since 1980, if the East Orange County subdivision had grown at the same rate as the rest of the county, it would have had thirty-eight thousand new jobs. Instead, it added ninety-one thousand new jobs. If we divide the government funding by the number of extra jobs created in East Orange County relative to the rest of the county, we get an estimate of $26,770 per job.", "This is just the tip of the iceberg.

The Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, will be made of officials from the agency\u2019s National Security Division, Criminal Division, Civil Division, Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys and FBI. It will be charged with working to ensure the Justice Department prioritizes pursuing cases involving ransomware attacks by increasing training for employees, focusing on intelligence sharing across the agency, improving coordination and leveraging all investigative leads. The task force will also create and implement a strategy to combat the criminal enterprise involved in ransomware attacks along with strengthening public-private partnerships between the Justice Department and the private sector to address ransomware attacks and furthering collaboration with international partners. Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin announced the task force in a memo, obtained by The Hill, sent to task force members on Tuesday. Carlin wrote that the ransomware attacks, which involve attackers holding critical networks hostage and demanding payment, could have \u201cdevastating human and financial consequences.\u201d \u201cWhen criminals target critical infrastructure such as hospitals, utilities, and municipal networks, their activity jeopardizes the safety and health of Americans,\u201d Carlin wrote. \u201cThe Task Force will bring all of the Department's resources to bear to bolster our all-tools approach and work with our partners here and abroad to combat the threat of ransomware and digital extortion, and to ensure that we hold those who participate in the propagation of these crimes responsible and accountable,\u201d he added. The task force was convened following a year that saw a huge increase in ransomware attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic against groups including hospitals, schools and other critical organizations, with cyber criminals targeting vulnerable organizations to make money. The Justice Department has announced numerous cases targeting cyber criminals involved in carrying out ransomware attacks. These efforts included recently working with allied nations to disrupt the Emotet botnet, described as the \u201cworld\u2019s most destructive malware,\u201d issuing indictments against North Korean hackers involved in stealing billions of dollars in cryptocurrency, and bringing multiple other charges against hackers based in China, Russia and Iran. \u201cAlthough the Department has taken significant steps to address cybercrime, it is imperative that we bring the full authorities and resources of the Department to bear to confront the many dimensions and root causes of this threat,\u201d Carlin wrote.", ""], "id": "f1a471d6512dc22b80b0f50cae20934823cbbfab5f194c31b3f14f900e69f02e", "highlighted_text": " The Justice Department convened a new task force to address ransomware Acting Deputy Attorney General Carlin announced will bring all of the Department's resources to bear to bolster our all-tools approach to combat the threat of ransomware The Department announced numerous cases it is imperative that we bring the full resources to confront threat", "highlights": [[4, 0, 22], [4, 33, 69], [4, 83, 93], [4, 1032, 1062], [4, 1068, 1084], [4, 1549, 1559], [4, 1560, 1601], [4, 1602, 1635], [4, 1679, 1713], [4, 2131, 2134], [4, 2143, 2153], [4, 2158, 2167], [4, 2168, 2182], [4, 2667, 2701], [4, 2702, 2706], [4, 2723, 2732], [4, 2759, 2770], [4, 2815, 2821]], "underlines": [[4, 0, 22], [4, 23, 32], [4, 33, 69], [4, 70, 82], [4, 83, 93], [4, 94, 137], [4, 298, 320], [4, 397, 440], [4, 452, 561], [4, 600, 713], [4, 1032, 1062], [4, 1068, 1084], [4, 1534, 1548], [4, 1549, 1559], [4, 1560, 1601], [4, 1602, 1635], [4, 1679, 1713], [4, 2131, 2134], [4, 2135, 2142], [4, 2143, 2153], [4, 2154, 2157], [4, 2158, 2167], [4, 2167, 2167], [4, 2168, 2182], [4, 2183, 2252], [4, 2592, 2666], [4, 2667, 2701], [4, 2702, 2706], [4, 2707, 2722], [4, 2723, 2732], [4, 2733, 2758], [4, 2759, 2770], [4, 2771, 2814], [4, 2815, 2821], [4, 2821, 2836]], "emphasis": [[4, 1560, 1601], [4, 2702, 2706], [4, 2723, 2732]], "cite_emphasis": [], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local"}, {"tag": "Plan tradeoffs", "cite": "Frank, 1-5-2021, \"Managing Antitrust Risk in the Biden Administration,\" Fried Frank, https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8f2eaf8e-db8e-47d5-80c5-c912e3042591)", "body": ["Further, despite a record number of litigated cases, the budget at the antitrust agencies is insufficient to match the rhetoric of more enforcement.

Current conditions in Northeast Asia suggest that multiple precursory conditions for nuclear terrorism already exist or exist in nascent form.  In Japan, for example, low-level, individual, terroristic violence with nuclear materials, against nuclear facilities, is real.  In all countries of the region, the risk of diversion of nuclear material is real, although the risk is likely higher due to volume and laxity of security in some countries of the region than in others.  In all countries, the risk of an insider \u201csleeper\u201d threat is real in security and nuclear agencies, and such insiders already operated in actual terrorist organizations.  Insider corruption is also observable in nuclear fuel cycle agencies in all countries of the region.  The threat of extortion to induce insider cooperation is also real in all countries.  The possibility of a cult attempting to build and buy nuclear weapons is real and has already occurred in the region.[15]  Cyber-terrorism against nuclear reactors is real and such attacks have already taken place in South Korea (although it remains difficult to attribute the source of the attacks with certainty).  The stand-off ballistic and drone threat to nuclear weapons and fuel cycle facilities is real in the region, including from non-state actors, some of whom have already adopted and used such technology almost instantly from when it becomes accessible (for example, drones).[16]", "Two other broad risk factors are also present in the region.  The social and political conditions for extreme ethnic and xenophobic nationalism are emerging in China, Korea, Japan, and Russia.  Although there has been no risk of attack on or loss of control over nuclear weapons since their removal from Japan in 1972 and from South Korea in 1991, this risk continues to exist in North Korea, China, and Russia, and to the extent that they are deployed on aircraft and ships of these and other nuclear weapons states (including submarines) deployed in the region\u2019s high seas, also outside their territorial borders.", "The most conducive circumstance for catalysis to occur due to a nuclear terrorist attack might involve the following nexi of timing and conditions:", "Low-level, tactical, or random individual terrorist attacks for whatever reasons, even assassination of national leaders, up to and including dirty radiological bomb attacks, that overlap with inter-state crisis dynamics in ways that affect state decisions to threaten with or to use nuclear weapons. This might be undertaken by an opportunist nuclear terrorist entity in search of rapid and high political impact.", "Attacks on major national or international events in each country to maximize terror and to de-legitimate national leaders and whole governments. In Japan, for example, more than ten heads of state and senior ministerial international meetings are held each year.  For the strategic nuclear terrorist, patiently acquiring higher level nuclear threat capabilities for such attacks and then staging them to maximum effect could accrue strategic gains.", "Attacks or threatened attacks, including deception and disguised attacks, will have maximum leverage when nuclear-armed states are near or on the brink of war or during a national crisis (such as Fukushima), when intelligence agencies, national leaders, facility operators, surveillance and policing agencies, and first responders are already maximally committed and over-extended.", "At this point, we note an important caveat to the original concept of catalytic nuclear war as it might pertain to nuclear terrorist threats or attacks.  Although an attack might be disguised so that it is attributed to a nuclear-armed state, or a ruse might be undertaken to threaten such attacks by deception, in reality a catalytic strike by a nuclear weapons state in conditions of mutual vulnerability to nuclear retaliation for such a strike from other nuclear armed states would be highly irrational.", "Accordingly, the effect of nuclear terrorism involving a nuclear detonation or major radiological release may not of itself be catalytic of nuclear war\u2014at least not intentionally\u2013because it will not lead directly to the destruction of a targeted nuclear-armed state.  Rather, it may be catalytic of non-nuclear war between states, especially if the non-state actor turns out to be aligned with or sponsored by a state (in many Japanese minds, the natural candidate for the perpetrator of such an attack is the pro-North Korean General Association of Korean Residents, often called Chosen Soren, which represents many of the otherwise stateless Koreans who were born and live in Japan) and a further sequence of coincident events is necessary to drive escalation to the point of nuclear first use by a state. Also, the catalyst\u2014the non-state actor\u2013is almost assured of discovery and destruction either during the attack itself (if it takes the form of a nuclear suicide attack then self-immolation is assured) or as a result of a search-and-destroy campaign from the targeted state (unless the targeted government is annihilated by the initial terrorist nuclear attack).", "It follows that the effects of a non-state nuclear attack may be characterized better as a trigger effect, bringing about a cascade of nuclear use decisions within NC3 systems that shift each state increasingly away from nuclear non-use and increasingly towards nuclear use by releasing negative controls and enhancing positive controls in multiple action-reaction escalation spirals (depending on how many nuclear armed states are party to an inter-state conflict that is already underway at the time of the non-state nuclear attack); and/or by inducing concatenating nuclear attacks across geographically proximate nuclear weapons forces of states already caught in the crossfire of nuclear threat or attacks of their own making before a nuclear terrorist attack.[17]"], "id": "c320bdaf74d3d7861cfc4651d8197ebecc520bde0ffa431aecb1e9a978304373", "highlighted_text": " nuc terror \u201ccatalyze\u201d nuclear war a cult build and buy nuclear weapons terrorism may be catalytic and drive escalation to first use a attack may be a trigger bringing cascade of nuclear decisions within NC3 that shift toward releasing controls in spirals inducing attacks", "highlights": [[2, 28, 31], [2, 36, 42], [2, 57, 67], [2, 80, 91], [2, 1048, 1054], [2, 1069, 1082], [2, 1083, 1098], [9, 35, 44], [9, 279, 285], [9, 286, 295], [9, 685, 688], [9, 745, 750], [9, 751, 761], [9, 762, 764], [9, 786, 795], [10, 31, 32], [10, 51, 64], [10, 89, 90], [10, 91, 98], [10, 107, 115], [10, 124, 131], [10, 132, 142], [10, 147, 167], [10, 176, 186], [10, 254, 260], [10, 277, 286], [10, 296, 304], [10, 337, 339], [10, 376, 383], [10, 546, 554], [10, 577, 584]], "underlines": [[2, 26, 27], [2, 28, 31], [2, 31, 35], [2, 36, 42], [2, 42, 56], [2, 57, 67], [2, 68, 79], [2, 80, 91], [2, 91, 107], [2, 108, 119], [2, 120, 142], [2, 143, 152], [2, 153, 190], [2, 243, 321], [2, 322, 334], [2, 1029, 1047], [2, 1048, 1054], [2, 1055, 1068], [2, 1069, 1082], [2, 1083, 1098], [2, 1099, 1101], [2, 1102, 1106], [5, 31, 59], [5, 180, 259], [5, 280, 299], [9, 13, 34], [9, 35, 44], [9, 279, 285], [9, 286, 295], [9, 685, 688], [9, 689, 690], [9, 699, 707], [9, 708, 710], [9, 722, 728], [9, 745, 750], [9, 751, 761], [9, 762, 764], [9, 778, 785], [9, 786, 795], [10, 31, 32], [10, 33, 50], [10, 51, 64], [10, 65, 88], [10, 89, 90], [10, 91, 98], [10, 99, 105], [10, 105, 106], [10, 107, 115], [10, 116, 123], [10, 124, 131], [10, 132, 142], [10, 143, 146], [10, 147, 167], [10, 168, 175], [10, 176, 186], [10, 187, 253], [10, 254, 260], [10, 260, 276], [10, 277, 286], [10, 287, 295], [10, 296, 304], [10, 305, 336], [10, 337, 339], [10, 339, 339], [10, 340, 375], [10, 376, 383], [10, 536, 539], [10, 546, 554], [10, 554, 554], [10, 555, 576], [10, 577, 584], [10, 585, 764]], "emphasis": [[2, 28, 31], [2, 36, 42], [2, 57, 67], [2, 68, 79], [2, 80, 91], [2, 108, 119], [2, 143, 152], [2, 322, 334], [2, 1069, 1082], [2, 1102, 1106], [9, 286, 295], [9, 699, 707], [9, 751, 761], [9, 778, 785], [9, 786, 795], [10, 91, 98], [10, 99, 105], [10, 124, 131], [10, 254, 260], [10, 277, 286], [10, 287, 295], [10, 296, 304], [10, 340, 375], [10, 376, 383], [10, 555, 576], [10, 577, 584]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-01-18"}, {"tag": "1NC \u2013 Security K", "cite": "Morrissey 11 (John Morrissey, Department of Geography, National University of Ireland, \u201cLiberal Lawfare and Biopolitics: US Juridical Warfare in the War on Terror\u201d.

As Mark Neocleous so aptly puts it, has the \u201cliberal project of \u2018liberty\u201d\u2019 not always been, in fact, a \u201cproject of security\u201d?116 This \u2018project of security\u2019 has long invoked a powerful political dispositif of \u2018executive powers\u2019, typically registered as \u2018emergency powers\u2019, but, as Neocleous makes clear, of the permanent kind.117 For Neocleous, the pursuit of \u2018security\u2019 \u2013 and more specifically \u2018capitalist security\u2019 \u2013 marked the very emergence of liberal democracies, and continues to frame our contemporary world. In the West at least, that world may be endlessly registered as a liberal democracy defined by the \u2018rule of law\u2019, but, as Neocleous reminds us, the assumption that the law, decoupled from politics, acts as the ultimate safeguard of democracy is simply false \u2013 a key point affirmed by considering the US military\u2019s extensive waging of liberal lawfare.

What happens when thought of politics starts at the limits of security? To answer this question, I inquired into three possible moves beyond politics of security. One of these three moves, I suggested, passes through de-centering the sovereign subject of security by exposing the Otherness constitutive of subjectivity as such. Shattering the illusion of a sovereign and secure self opens the way to formulate ethical responsibility on the premise of the radical interdependence inscribed at the heart of being. It recasts politics as a way of being in the world beyond a techno-politics of life.", "The second move beyond a politics of security that I discussed centered on the works of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, where politics is conceptualized as the overturning of the ordered space of security by staging political subjectivities in excess of the secure and functional order. Deploying the distinction that Ranci\u00e8re makes between \u201cpolice\u201d (logic of consensus) and \u201cpolitics\u201d (logic of dissensus), I suggested that, on this account, a politics beyond disrupts the reduction of politics to the management of the given and the securing of the proper distribution of identities, space, and time. ", "I elaborated the third and final move beyond politics of security by visiting Jacques Derrida\u2019s conception of political time as aporetic and his account of the future beyond representation. Such a conception of political time inscribes anxiety that issues from the absence of secure grounds as the condition of possibility of politics. In contrast to politics of security that annihilates political time as possibility by legislating the future, I argued, Derrida\u2019s thinking on political time allows for a form of writing the future beyond security.", "My investigation into alternative conceptions of political subjectivity beyond security hopes to serve as an opening that calls for further inquiry into other possibilities, other conceptions of politics that would allow approaching global political life with an idiom detoxified from security. Politics beyond politics of security can be a point of reflection in the light of many other questions that could be raised. For instance, if security reduces the body of the political community to a species body, what alternative forms of thinking about the body are available that could challenge this assertion? How would different conceptions of the body beyond biological thinking enable different forms of politics beyond bio-politics of security? Or should political thought abandon the thought of the body altogether?

What has been ignored even in this debate, however, is the exact role that each actor realistically plays in the \u2018bumpy\u2019 and complex risk landscape. Many errors of current innovation policy are due to placing actors in the wrong part of this landscape (both in time and space). For example, it is na\u00efve to expect venture capital to lead in the early and most risky stage of any new economic sector today (such as clean technology). In biotechnology, nanotechnology and the Internet, venture capital arrived 15\u201320 years after the most important investments were made by public sector funds.", "In fact, history shows that those areas of the risk landscape (within sectors at any point in time, or at the start of new sectors) that are defined by high capital intensity and high technological and market risk tend to be avoided by the private sector, and have required great amounts of public sector funding (of different types), as well as public sector vision and leadership, to get them off the ground.

Or might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign policy? This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition. Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy. This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), as well as many other possible confounding variables. This research questions existing theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace may result from economic troubles. Defining and Measuring Rivalry and Rivalry Termination I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which \u201c[b]oth actors view each other as a significant politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy.\u201d2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project\u2019s empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry.5 Why Might Economic Crisis Cause Rivalry Termination? Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels. (1) Economic crises lead to austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state. This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox foreign policy views. Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical examples that these mechanisms recur in practice.", ""], "id": "01a0e3d4760bb12eca8c627f9f6950f0c601beac029fbccda31c953138604342", "highlighted_text": " economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies Drawing on data from 109 rival dyads 67 terminated evidence suggests rivalries twice as likely to terminate during downturns crises lead to austerity pressures, which cut defense strategic reassessment threat deflation crises increase international cooperation", "highlights": [[2, 188, 222], [2, 223, 244], [2, 460, 484], [2, 494, 505], [2, 518, 520], [2, 530, 540], [2, 546, 573], [2, 593, 628], [2, 638, 647], [2, 3323, 3337], [2, 3419, 3445], [2, 3491, 3502], [2, 3552, 3574], [2, 3721, 3737], [2, 4010, 4016], [2, 4017, 4025], [2, 4066, 4079], [2, 4089, 4100]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 30], [2, 31, 65], [2, 67, 148], [2, 150, 187], [2, 188, 222], [2, 223, 244], [2, 245, 269], [2, 324, 459], [2, 460, 484], [2, 485, 493], [2, 494, 505], [2, 506, 517], [2, 518, 520], [2, 521, 529], [2, 530, 540], [2, 540, 545], [2, 546, 573], [2, 574, 592], [2, 593, 628], [2, 629, 637], [2, 638, 647], [2, 648, 698], [2, 700, 805], [2, 929, 981], [2, 983, 1099], [2, 1108, 1119], [2, 1145, 1184], [2, 3314, 3322], [2, 3323, 3337], [2, 3338, 3359], [2, 3360, 3389], [2, 3395, 3418], [2, 3419, 3445], [2, 3446, 3490], [2, 3491, 3502], [2, 3503, 3515], [2, 3521, 3551], [2, 3552, 3574], [2, 3576, 3720], [2, 3721, 3737], [2, 3739, 3826], [2, 3866, 3995], [2, 4001, 4009], [2, 4010, 4016], [2, 4016, 4016], [2, 4017, 4025], [2, 4026, 4065], [2, 4066, 4079], [2, 4080, 4088], [2, 4089, 4100], [2, 4500, 4543], [2, 4544, 4603], [2, 4604, 4612], [2, 4613, 4651]], "emphasis": [[2, 31, 65], [2, 223, 244], [2, 593, 628], [2, 629, 637], [2, 638, 647], [2, 1145, 1184], [2, 3314, 3322], [2, 3323, 3337], [2, 3338, 3359], [2, 3552, 3574], [2, 3721, 3737], [2, 4066, 4079], [2, 4080, 4088], [2, 4089, 4100], [2, 4544, 4603]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2015-01-01"}, {"tag": "1NC \u2013 War Offense", "cite": "Boehmer 10 (Charles R., Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Texas El Paso, \u201cEconomic Growth and violent international conflict: 1875-1999,\u201d Defence and Peace Economics, Volume 21, Issue 3, June 2010)", "body": ["The theory set forth earlier theorizes that economic growth increases perceptions of state strength, increasing the likelihood of violent interstate conflicts. Economic growth appears to increase the resolve of leaders to stand against challenges and the willingness to escalate disputes. A non-random pattern exists where higher rates of GDP growth over multiple years are positively and significantly related to the most severe international conflicts, whereas this is not true for overall conflict initiations. Moreover, growth of military expenditures, as a measure of the war chest proposition, does not offer any explanation for violent interstate conflicts. This is not to say that growth of military expenditures never has any effect on the occurrence of war, although such a link is not generally true in the aggregate using a large sample of states. In comparison, higher rates of economic growth are significantly related to violent interstate conflicts in the aggregate. States with growing economies are more apt to reciprocate military challenges by other states and become involved in violent interstate conflicts. The results also show that theories from the Crisis-Scarcity perspective lack explanatory power linking GDP growth rates to war at the state level of analysis. This is not to say that such theories completely lack explanatory power in general, but more particularly that they cannot directly link economic growth rates to state behavior in violent interstate conflicts. In contrast, theories of diversionary conflict may well hold some explanatory power, although not regarding GDP growth in a general test of states from all regions of the world across time. Perhaps diversionary theory better explains state behaviors short of war, where the costs of externalizing domestic tensions do not become too costly, or in relation to the foreign policies of particular countries. In many circumstances, engaging in a war to divert attention away from domestic conditions would seemingly exacerbate domestic crisis conditions unless the chances of victory were practically assured. Nonetheless, this study does show that domestic conflict is associated with interstate conflict. If diversionary conflict theory has any traction as an economic explanation of violent interstate conflicts, it may require the study of other explanatory variables besides overall GDP growth rates, such as unemployment or inflation rates. The contribution of this article has been to examine propositions about economic growth in a global study. Most existing studies on this topic focus on only the United States, samples of countries that are more developed on average (due to data availability in the past), or are based on historical information and not economic GDP data. While I have shown that there is no strong evidence linking military expenditures to violent interstate conflicts at the state level of analysis, much of the remaining Growth-as-Catalyst perspective is grounded in propositions that are not directly germane to questions about state conflict behavior, such as those linking state behavior to long-cycles, or those that remain at the systemic level. What answer remains linking economic growth to war once we eliminate military expenditures as an explanation? Considering that the concept of foreign policy mood is difficult to identify and measure, and that the bulk of the literature relies solely on the American historical experience, I do not rely on that concept. It is still possible that such moods affect some decision-makers. Instead, similar to Blainey, I find that economic growth, when sustained over a stretch of years, has its strongest effect on states once they find themselves in an international crisis. The results of this study suggest that states such as China, which have a higher level of opportunity to become involved in violent interstate conflicts due to their capabilities, geographic location, history of conflict, and so on, should also have a higher willingness to fight after enjoying multiple years of recent economic growth. One does not have to assume that an aggressive China will emerge from growth. If conflicts do present themselves, then China may be more likely to escalate a war given its recent national performance.

At the end of the second decade of the 21st Century scientists\u2014if not politicians\u2014have declared anthropogenic climate change an existential threat (Spratt and Dunlop, 2017, 2019; IPCC, 2018).

Meanwhile, a million non-human species face extinction from the human-induced decline of natural systems (IPBES, 2019); the pollution of air, land and oceans continues unabated; soil erosion and land degradation directly threaten two-fifths of the human population (Watts, 2018), etc., etc. On the socio-political front, we are witnessing growing civil discontent with wide-spread political corruption and increasingly egregious income disparity, elevated global tension over diminishing water and energy resources, and continuous energy-related war(s) in the Middle East (Castelo, 2018; Klare, 2014).

In this age of financialization we need reminding that, to the majority of people, the \u2018economy\u2019 still refers mainly to the production, distribution and consumption of physical goods. It is the (un)economic over-exploitation of biophysical systems that results in pollution (including GHG emissions/ climate change), fisheries collapses, land degradation, etc. A cascade of data shows that the human enterprise is in ecological overshoot, consuming nature\u2019s goods and services faster than ecosystems can regenerate and dumping (often toxic) wastes beyond nature\u2019s processing/ recycling capacity (Wackernagel et al., 2002; IPBES, 2019; Pearce, 2019).

Neo-liberal economics scorns regulation and considers markets the arbiter of social value. In these circumstances, interest bearing money, mergers and acquisitions, regressive taxation and regulatory corruption ensure that an increasing proportion of national wealth flows to the already wealthy (Kennedy, 1995). In the United States, the rich-poor income gap has widened for several decades as neoliberal policies have taken hold. Since 1989 the share of national income going to wealthiest 1 % has almost doubled while the share going to families in poverty has stagnated. By 2017, the average annual income of the wealthiest 1 % averaged 39 times that of the bottom 90 % and \u201can estimated 43.5 percent of the total U.S. population (140 million people) [were] either poor or low-income\u201d (Inequality.org, 2019).", "These data are extreme for an OECD country, but egregious inequality is a global phenomenon.

In search of economic realism", "Ecological economics (ecol-econ) was framed as a more realistic alternative to neoliberal economics (Costanza, 1991; Daly and Farley, 2010). Ecol-econ sees the economy as a fully contained, dependent, prone-to-grow subsystem of the non-growing ecosphere. Ecological economists recognize that: a) the economy is dynamically connected to the rest of nature through resource extraction/consumption and waste production and; b) all economically-relevant energy and material transformations are subject to biophysical laws, particularly the laws of thermodynamics (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Martinez-Alier, 1991). Thus, the most important economic flows are the unidirectional irreversible throughputs of energy and material rather than the self-inflating circular flows of abstract money value.", "Significantly, humanity\u2019s growth-driven ecological predicament is generally predictable from the assumptions of ecological economics (which tends to validate the assumptions).

These facts should help shape ecological economics.", "Competitive displacement or \u2018the demise of nature\u2019", "Intra-and inter-specific competition for scarce habitat and food is a powerful selection pressure in the evolution of most life forms.2 Two innate tendencies that humans share with other species are predispositions to expand to occupy all accessible habitats and to use all available resources.3 In fact, H. sapiens is classified as a reproductive Kstrategist because human populations historically tended to press up against the carrying capacities (\u2018K\u2019) of their habitats. K-strategists are generally long-lived, slowly reproducing species with extensive parental care and relatively high rates of offspring survival. Thus their populations grow until their habitats \u2018push back\u2019\u2014negative feedback may include spatial crowding, disease, food shortages, ecosystems degradation, etc.4 Humans are archetypal K-strategists, but have a competitive \u2018leg-up\u2019 in the game because technological advances tend to increase resource availability and therefore short-term carrying capacity.", "Humanity\u2019s competitive superiority has been well documented.

They found that, in 22 of 31 tests, humans lie outside the 99 % confidence limits for variation among other species and that our technology-aided demands on exploited ecosystems often dwarf those of competing species. For example, the human population is two orders of magnitude greater than the upper 95 % confidence limits of populations of 63 similar-sized mammal species; human aggregate consumption of biomass from the biosphere exceeds the upper 95 % confidence limits for biomass ingestion by 95 nonhuman mammal species by two orders of magnitude and; humanity\u2019s geographic range exceeds the upper 95 % confidence limit for the ranges of 523 other mammal species by a factor of ten.", "As human populations expand they necessarily appropriate ecological space required by other species.

From a fraction of 1 % ten millennia ago, humans now constitute 36 %, and our domestic livestock another 60 %, of the planet\u2019s much expanded mammalian biomass compared to only 4 % for all wild species combined. Similarly, domestic poultry now comprise 70 % of Earth\u2019s remaining avian biomass (data from Bar-On et al., 2018; see also Smil, 2011).

Contrary to politicians\u2019 assertions that economic growth can be compatible with conserving \u2018the environment\u2019, a core principle of ecological economics should be that, beyond a certain scale (long-since exceeded), there is an absolute conflict between the economy and ecosystem integrity. (This consideration is not even visible to neoliberal models); 2) While mainstream economists see \u2018the economy\u2019 and \u2018the environment\u2019 as virtually separate systems (and believe the former is further decoupling from the latter) ecological economists can assert that H. oeconomicus is the most ecologically significant macro-consumer organism (both herbivore and carnivore) in all the major terrestrial and most marine ecosystems on Earth; 3) Finally, the data highlight a double-barrelled behavioral challenge to sustainability\u2014H. sapiens\u2019 genetic predisposition to expand is being reinforced by a socially constructed cultural meme, the neoliberal growth ethic, as most dramatically expressed through global capitalism. Nature and nurture, the latter abetted by technology, conspire against human society living within safe planetary boundaries. The central question is how can ecolecon contribute to neutralizing this potentially fatal confluence? Subsidiary questions (admittedly anthropocentric) are, what level of biodiversity is necessary, and what percentage of ecosystem area should be left unexploited (or restored), to ensure the continued functioning of essential life-support services as necessary for human survival?", "Just what is nature worth?", "These questions are not likely to be satisfactorily answered by \u2018putting a price on nature\u2019 (Spangenberg and Settele, 2010; Rees, 2006). Ecol-econ has dedicated considerable attention to the commoditization of so-called natural capital on grounds that knowing its money value should discourage depletion. This effort has done little to retard degradation, in part because monetization is a relapse into neoliberal market thinking, displaces other approaches and leaves no room for a fall-back position. A major problem is that many species have no market value or valid shadow price\u2014their contributions, if any, to ecointegrity are simply unknowable until they disappear. Similarly, various life-support services may be transparent to detection, rendering monetary valuation impossible (Vatn and Bromley, 1994). ", "These technical limitations alone can invalidate cost-benefit analysis\u2014undervalued natural capital gives way to competing profitable development. Ecological economists must therefore accept that conventional economic logic is an unreliable ally in protecting nature. Mainstream valuation can never fully capture the ultimate worth of most species or so-called ecosystems services. In short:", "\u2026to the dismay of all those conservationists who have joined the valuation bandwagon in the hope it would play a preservationist tune, pure economic reasoning generally resonates more with the prevailing symphony of destruction [\u2026] Absent a crisis, the perceived value of biodiversity is likely always to be less than the measurable value of development. [In the circumstances,] the valuation exercise becomes a mere formality that turns against biodiversity by rationalizing its destruction (Rees, 2006).", "If it is theoretically impossible to monetize life-forms and eco-processes, then ecological economists must devise and champion some other approach to valuing life.

That means we are the richest, strongest people in the world and that we have the highest standard of living in the world. That is why we need so much energy, and may it always be that way (US President Richard Nixon, November 1973, p. 980).", "Ecological economists should be more creative in exploring the role of energy in both human evolution and economic progress. Physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (the father of statistical thermodynamics) famously speculated as early as 1886 that the Darwinian struggle for existence is really a competition for available energy. Subsequently, ecologists Alfred Lotka (1922) and later Howard Odum formulated what is now known as the \u2018maximum power principle\u2019: Successful systems are those that evolve in ways that maximize their use of available energy per unit time in the performance of useful work (growth, self-maintenance and reproduction) (see Hall, 1995). In the Anthropocene, no other species comes close to challenging humanity\u2019s energy hegemony. As President Nixon implicitly understood, \u2018maximum power\u2019 is a fundamental organizing force in both ecosystems and socioeconomic systems.", "That said, humanity\u2019s power supremacy had a long gestation period. Anatomically modern humans have existed for about 200,000 years but it wasn\u2019t until we committed to fossil-fuels only 200 years ago that we came fully to exercise our \u2018maximum power\u2019 muscle. The 19th Century shift to coal, oil and natural gas marked humanity\u2019s fateful transition from mainly endosomatic or \u2018within body\u2019 renewable energy (animal and human labor, including slavery), to dependence on an entirely exosomatic but depletable energy source (buried stocks of stored ancient solar energy). Modern society was birthed by, and remains precariously balanced on, a gusher of petroleum.5", "Contemporary analysts rarely acknowledge what a uniquely remarkable transition this has been. For most of humanity\u2019s at least 200,000 year history, population growth was negligible and attributable mainly to expansion out of Africa during the past 60 millennia. Even with agriculture and the boost in food production 10,000 years ago, it took 99.9 % of human history for the population to top one billion early in the early 1800s.", "Then, in just 200 years\u20141/1000th as much time required to reach the first billion\u2014the population ballooned over 7-fold to 7.4 billion by 2016. The principal enabler was the 1300-fold increase in global fossil energy use that energized industrialization between1800 and 2016.6 Fossil power facilitated a 100-fold increase in real global GDP and a factor 13 (rising to 25-fold in the richest countries) surge in average per capita incomes (Roser, 2019). In short, fossil energy, along with access to the land and resources of the \u2018new-world\u2019 and improving population health, suppressed natural negative feedback (e.g., disease, food/land/ resource shortages) and freed H. sapiens to express its innate capacity to expand exponentially (sometimes super-exponentially; Fig. 1).", "Of course, it is these parallel (and on-going) increases in energy supply, population, resource consumption and waste production that are driving climate change and the precipitous degradation of the ecosphere. And \u2018precipitous\u2019 is precisely the right word. It is a quirk of exponential growth that half the fossil energy ever used (and half the fossil CO2 ever produced), has been burned (emitted) in just the past 35 years!7 (The same for many other industrially important minerals and metals and waste generation/pollution.) During the 20th Century, humanity\u2019s \u2018maximum power\u2019 leverage elevated our species to superiority not only as the dominant ecological entity on Earth but also as the major geological force changing the face of the planet. Ironically, maximum power success may be our downfall. The economics facilitating this rise to power dominance ignores the biophysical laws governing every energy and material transformation!", "2.3. Raising humanity far-from-equilibrium, disordering the ecosphere)", "Every process, event, happening\u2014call it what you will; in a word, everything that is going on in Nature means an increase of the entropy of the part of the world where it is going on (Schr\u00f6dinger, 1945)", "All energy and material transformations are subject to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy law. The second law dictates that any spontaneous change in an isolated system\u2014a system that can exchange neither energy nor material with its environment\u2014increases the system\u2019s entropy (where \u2018entropy\u2019 is a measure of disorder or randomness). Each successive change in an isolated system creates greater disorder; concentrations disperse, gradients disappear and energy dissipates. In simple language, the second law states that things naturally run down, wear out and crumble away. Eventually, \u201ca permanent state is reached, in which no observable events occur\u201d (Schr\u00f6dinger, 1945). This is a state of local \u2018thermodynamic equilibrium\u2019, or maximum entropy, in which no further change is possible.", "Of course, many real-world systems from single-celled amoebae to the entire ecosphere are neither crumbling nor slipping toward equilibrium; in fact, all living systems persist in a state of thermodynamic disequilibrium. The ecosphere, for example, is a self-organizing system of mind-numbing complexity and multi-layered structure comprising steep material gradients, millions of distinct species, thousands of ecosystems and incalculable accumulations of energy-rich biomass. Moreover, over billions of years of evolution, on average, all these qualities have been increasing\u2014i.e., the ecosphere has been moving ever further from equilibrium. Indeed, distance from equilibrium may well be the measure of life: it is \u201c\u2026an essential parameter in describing nature, much like temperature is in standard equilibrium thermodynamics\u201d (Prigogine, 1997).", "While living things seem to violate the second law, they are actually subject to the same inexorable processes of entropic decay as everything else. However, because they are open rather than isolated systems, organisms, ecosystems (and economies) are able to extract energy and concentrated matter (\u2018negentropy\u2019) from their \u2018environments\u2019 which they use to maintain themselves, grow and reproduce; they simultaneously inject resultant waste heat and degraded materials (entropy) back into their surroundings.8 Because living systems survive by continuously degrading and dissipating low entropy energy and matter they are called \u2018dissipative structures\u2019 (Prigogine, 1997).", "Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen was among the first economists to understand (and be rejected for understanding) the implications of the second law for the economy. He observed repeatedly that \u201c\u2026in a finite space there can be only a finite amount of low entropy and, second, that low entropy continuously and irrevocably dwindles away\u201d (e.g., Georgescu-Roegen, 1975, p. 359). This observation is the more relevant in light of the structural/functional relationships described by SOHO (selforganizing holarchic open) systems theory (see Kay and Regier, 2001). Living systems, including the human enterprise, exist in overlapping nested hierarchies in which each component sub-system (holon) is contained by a higher level in the system, and itself hosts a complex of linked sub-systems at lower levels. (Think of Russian nesting dolls). Within the hierarchy each holon thrives\u2014maintains itself far-from-equilibrium\u2014by extracting low entropy energy and material from its host system one level up and exporting resultant degraded energy and material wastes (entropy) back into that host. In short, living organisms create and increase their local structure and complexity at the expense of increased global disorder and decay (Schneider and Kay, 1994, 1995).", "SOHO relationships should reframe all economists\u2019 understanding of humans-in-nature. It is true that both the human enterprise and the ecosphere are self-producing far-from-equilibrium dissipative structures. However, while the ecosphere evolves and maintains itself in dynamic steady-state by dissipating an extra-terrestrial source of negentropy, sunlight, the human sub-system to date can grow and complexify (i.e., raise itself ever further from equilibrium) only by dissipating its host system, the ecosphere.", "That said, there was nothing inherently unstable or unsustainable about energy and material dynamics within the pre-industrial SOHO hierarchy. Ecosystems self-produce, indefinitely powered by solar energy; anabolism marginally exceeds catabolism so biomass accumulates; the recycling process\u2014nature\u2019s \u2018waste\u2019 sink\u2014is capacious. Thus, for 99.9 % of human history our species functioned within thermodynamically \u2018healthy\u2019 limits. Indeed, net primary production by producer species (mostly green plants) has been more than adequate to sustain not only humans but also the world\u2019s entire complement of millions of other consumer species.", "2.4. H. sapiens as plague species", "Serious problems emerged only in the fossil fuel age. Coal, oil and natural gas have helped raise the human enterprise so far-from-equilibrium that (rising) demand for negentropy to maintain and grow the economy exceeds the productive and assimilative capacities of host ecosystems. The resultant entropic disordering of the ecosphere is evident in biodiversity loss, dissipation of soils and material resources (including fossil fuels), accumulating GHGs/climate change, ocean dead zones, etc., all signature symptoms of overshoot and apparent gross human ecological dysfunction.", "I say \u2018apparent\u2019 because the root cause is natural. Recall that all species populations have a predisposition to expand exponentially. When exposed to a temporary abundance of some limiting resource, many respond with an explosive population outbreak. Some species in simple ecosystems exhibit regular cycles of outbreak followed by collapse in which the outbreak is referred to as the \u2018plague phase\u2019 of the cycle (e.g., CSIRO, 2019). The plague continues until negative feedback\u2014food shortages, disease, predation, etc., depending on species and circumstances\u2014knocks the population back (Korpim\u00e4ki et al., 2004).", "As exemplary \u2018K\u2019-strategists, humans are as prone to population outbreaks as any similar species (only the time scales differ). When fossil-fueled technology reduced normal negative feedback by providing access to all necessary food and other material resources, humanity embarked on a 200+ year global population outbreak now well into plague phase (Fig. 1) with all the negative consequences for the ecosphere described above.", "This raises an important question for all economists: can\u2014or should\u2014the human plague phase be extended indefinitely or will it wind down, either through controlled implosion, gradual unraveling or catastrophic collapse? The answer is suggested by examination of energy consumption by country and region as of 2018 (Fig. 2). The horizontal line at \u20180\u2019 represents global average energy consumption per capita remembering that energy use is tightly correlated with GDP/ capita. Relatively rich OECD countries representing only 17 % of the world\u2019s population consume 2.4 times as much energy per capita as world average citizen and 3.4 times as much as non-OECD citizens (83 % of the world\u2019s population) (Fig. 2).", "To address equity concerns and bring the present non-OECD population to just average 2018 OECD levels\u2014still low compared to high-end users such as Norway, Canada and the US\u2014would require increasing global energy consumption by 140 %. At a global energy-use growth rate of 2.0 %/year, total primary energy use would double in just 35 years\u2014scarcely over 2 /3rds of the way to 140 %\u2014and more energy and other resources would be consumed/dissipated during that doubling than the total to date since 1800! Are there adequate fossil energy supplies? What would this mean for CO2 emissions? Could the already stressed ecosphere cope with the attendant massive entropy injection? And what about the expected additional billions of people? Meanwhile, the IPCC 1.5 C degree special report demands nearly 50 % lower emissions by 2030 and complete decarbonization by 2050, i.e. 6 % annual reductions beginning immediately.", "This conundrum will not soon be resolved by the much-heralded shift to \u2018green\u2019 alternative energy. The hype over wind, solar and other \u2018green\u2019 energy sources notwithstanding, no fully adequate substitutes for fossil fuels are available (IER, 2019; Mills, 2019) and absolute decarbonization is not occurring (Schr\u00f6der and Storm, 2018). Global energy demand grew by 2.9 % in 2018 led by natural gas; carbon emissions grew by 2.0 %. Renewables did contribute about a third of the growth in electrical power generation\u2014solar now produces about 585 TWh and wind 1270 TWh globally (total = 1850 TWh). However, the global increase in demand for electricity in 2018 was 938 TWh, 60% more than the total output of all existing solar photovoltaic installations. Just two years of electricity demand increase absorbs the entire contribution from more than three decades of wind and solar power development (data from BP, 2019).", "Even if the world were successfully to engineer a economically viable combination of fossil fuels and renewables sufficient to double energy production, we still have a problem. The use of so much energy to expand and raise the human enterprise even further-from-equilibrium, would guarantee both disastrous climate change and accelerate the parasitic hollowing-out of the ecosphere. Bottom line: human enterprise will almost certainly be forced to contract by energy/food/etc. shortages or foundering life-support systems.", "3. Discussion \u2013 where is the \u2018economics\u2019 in the ultimate human saga?", "The forgoing narrative obviously describes humanity\u2019 ecological predicament but it is no less a description of economic reality. On an elementary level, each of the concepts explored above provides a key to understanding: a) the full implications of humanity\u2019s extraction and use of energy and material resources including direct and unaccounted costs; b) the limited utility of attempts to price so-called natural capital; c) the eventual inevitability of simultaneous depletion (physical scarcity) and pollution (entropic disorder) on a global scale; d) the fundamental conflict between continuous material growth and maintaining ecological integrity; e) why inequality cannot be resolved through economic growth alone and; f) the limited scope for enhanced \u2018factor productivity\u2019 and factor substitution which constitute mainstream\u2019s major means to sustainability. On this last point: SOHO thermodynamics underscores that, while some dematerialization may occur, it is not even theoretically possible to \u2018decouple\u2019 the economy from the ecosphere (see also Ward et al., 2016); empirical data provide \u201c\u2026no evidence of decoupling of rising standards of living and consumptionbased carbon emissions\u2014which means that the future has to be different from the past, because \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 economics will lead us to \u2018Hothouse Earth\u2019\u201d (Schr\u00f6der and Storm, 2018, p. 22).", "The most profound and disturbing insight from all this is that, left unchecked, highly evolved and perfectly normal eco-behavioral predispositions, as manifested in humanity\u2019s fossil-energy powered economic exploitation of the natural world, have the potential to collapse the human enterprise. Some say societal collapse is inevitable (Bendell, 2018). These issues should be at the core of economic thinking for sustainability. In practice, however, daily reports on the state of the economy or global markets (which may actually follow news about the latest pollution disaster, heat wave or super-storm) never ask when \u2018enough is enough\u2019, just how \u2018far-from-equilibrium\u2019 can we safely go, or what life-style changes are necessary to avoid catastrophe.

Motivational studies tell us that H. sapiens is not primarily a rational species\u2014emotion and instinct play a remarkably large role in directing human affairs. Indeed, circumstances in which high intelligence rule our actions may actually be quite limited and their effect relatively trivial in the grand evolutionary context (see Rees, 2010). In particular, when humans feel their physical safety or social status is under threat, or they are sorely tempted by some forbidden fruit, the Dr Jekyll of reason may not be able to prevail over the Mr Hyde of emotion or instinct. Some argue that free will as normally understood is largely illusion (Harris, 2012; also Overbye, 2007).

It wouldbe fair to ask whether the Court was focused on the right problem. When considered against the possibility that North Carolina could randomly pick someone out of the Raleigh phonebook and designate that person the state dental regulator without review, the FTC's concern that person might have a conflict of interest by virtue of a financial interest in dentistry borders on the petty. Yet antitrust's state action doctrine, as it has developed over time, drove the Court to just such a result. Moreover, the Court's economic focus on the harms of state action has caused the Court to ignore the political value of state action immunity. For instance, the Court described state action as a \"disfavored\" doctrine,26 0 when it is in fact a necessary component of federalism. Anticompetitive state regulation, as distasteful as it might be to economists, is an expression of state political systems in exactly the same way as other forms of regulation are; there is no reason to single out regulation that harms competition-as indeed all regulation harms competition to some degree 2 6 1-for especially disfavorable treatment. State action presents some very difficult questions-some going to core ideas about republican government that border on the imponderable.

That\u2019s because Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure is more homogeneous, the result of electrification happening under the standardizing eye of the former Soviet Union, he told me.

Disasters like hurricane Katrina (2005), floods in Iowa (2019), and the on-going droughts and wildfires in California, all illustrate the high potential for damage to life and property caused by these disasters. Despite growing scientific evidence on climate change, there is limited federal action on mitigation (reducing GHG emissions) and adaptation (building resilience) in the country. Much like the historical pattern in environmental policymaking, states and local governments are filling the federal climate policy void by taking action on their own initiative (Rabe, 2008). A range of scholars have examined the development of climate policy in the U.S. (Wheeler, 2008; Rabe, 2010; Krause, 2011, Bromley\u2010Trujillo, Butler, Poe, & Davis, 2016; to name a few). Most of these studies focus on understanding climate mitigation policies and emissions reduction programs among state and local governments. Climate adaptation, in comparison, is relatively underexamined (Javeline, 2014) [there are exceptions, like: Bierbaum, Smith, Lee, Blair, Carter, Chapin, et al., 2013, Koski & Siulagi, 2016; Koski and Keating, 2018]. The politics surrounding adaptation is different from mitigation as adaptation does not present the same collective action problems. Resilience initiatives undertaken by a government, such as improved water storage infrastructure, will benefit its jurisdiction irrespective of whether other jurisdictions take similar measures. Conversely, mitigation measures to reduce emissions within the same jurisdiction would not necessarily result in benefits of reduced climate change impacts, if other governments and individuals do not undertake similar measures (free-rider problem). This demands a separate investigation of climate adaptation. Additionally, climate change poses various challenges of governance. As a \u2018wicked problem\u2019, policies to build resilience or reduce emissions often involve complex scientific and technical information, and cut across different agencies and bureaucracies. There are large risks and uncertainties, and these are spread over long timeframes, spanning beyond a decade to the next 50 to 100 years (IPCC, 2018). Within the U.S., these challenges are further exasperated with the large partisan divide on the issue. This contentious nature of climate politics presents a unique case to explore differences between symbolic and substantive policymaking (Krause, 2011). There is growing scholarship examining drivers of policy stringency (Carley & Miller, 2012, Bromley\u2010Trujillo et al., 2016) and examining the same through politics of climate adaptation will expand our understanding of the mechanisms at play. This article examines the factors that predict the emergence of State Adaptation Plans (SAPs) in the United States. I ask two main questions \u2013 why are some states initiating adaptation planning while others are not? And do these predictors vary across policy intensity - states that set ambitious policy goals for more substantive outcomes versus states that adopt limited goals as mere symbolic policymaking? I apply the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory using two dependent variables. The first is a basic measure of policy adoption, noting if a state has adopted its State Adaptation Plan (SAP) or not. The second dependent variable captures the intensity of a state\u2019s commitment to climate adaption by measuring the number of goals articulated in these plans. Using panel data from 2009 to 2015, I consider the relative influence of internal state characteristics, such as problem severity, citizen demand, state fiscal capacity and interest group pressures along with testing the impact of external pressure driving the development and level of commitment to climate adaption. I find that states tend to adopt policies when faced with greater climate vulnerabilities, and are influenced by the prevailing ideology of the mass public. While there are differences between adaptation and mitigation policies, my results show that states with previous experience of mitigation were more likely to adopt adaptation plans. To adopt a mitigation policy, states would most likely have to cross policy hurdles associated with building consensus around climate change. While this consensus is not necessary to build resilience, benefits of creating acceptance tends to help build support for adaptation as well. Policy intensity, on the other hand, is driven by interest group politics, fiscal capacity, and diffusion of policy ideas. As states overcome the negative pressures from carbon intensive industries and adopt a policy, the presence of greater number of environmental groups leads states to prepare more detailed and stringent plans (Bromley-Trujillo and Poe, 2018). And these plans are more likely to have a higher number of policy goals in states with greater resources to cover costs associated with implementing strategies. Additionally, once a state decides to adopt, they seem more likely to work with other states in their Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) region to prepare ambitious and comprehensive plans (Stoutenborough and Beverlin, 2008). It maybe that regional offices serve as conduits for information and sharing policy lessons such as resources, scientific/climate data and recommendations for effective adaptation strategies. For highly salient and politicized issues like climate change, the politics is definitely complex. My findings indicate that some policymakers maybe responding to forces such as climate vulnerabilities and citizen demands, but are limited in their ability to act due to factors like insufficient resources or substantial negative push-back from the carbon intensive industry. This is likely to result in either inaction or mere symbolic efforts where policies are adopted (to please their constituents) but without sufficient stringency of goals to build adequate climate resilience (responding to the industry). When environmental group pressures are high, and states have more resources at their disposal, they are more likely to learn from other states and develop comprehensive adaptation plans aimed at creating substantive policy change. These finding advance our understanding of which factors are potential barriers and incentives for policymakers in decisions on climate adaptation planning.

The investigations of any of these four firms will take years to unfold, and even longer to prosecute. Take, for example, Microsoft. The FTC launched an investigation into the software firm\u2019s bundling practices in 1990, with the DOJ following suit eight years later. At the time, the company\u2019s Windows operating system accounted for 90 percent of the PC market. The DOJ eventually charged Microsoft, claiming that its Internet Explorer browser, which was built into Windows, had an unfair advantage over other web browsers like Netscape. In 2000, a federal judge ordered the company to be split into separate entities, but an appeals court reversed the ruling. The DOJ and Microsoft finally settled the case in 2002\u2014a full twelve years after a regulatory agency first launched an investigation. Microsoft was ultimately required to give computer manufacturers identical licensing contracts for Windows, which gave other companies more equal access to the browser market, as well as undergo nine years of court supervision into its business practices. The punishment was, to say the least, much reduced from its original form. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Justice was not overly successful in that attack,\u201d says McCareins, who was a partner in the firm that represented Microsoft, Winston & Strawn. Any Penalties Are Likely to Be Insufficient Which brings McCareins to his final argument: even if regulators are successful in proving anticompetitive behavior by one of the big four, the penalties will likely be civil judgements in the form of large fines, which may not serve as an effective deterrent for such huge, highly profitable companies. In addition, the antitrust division announced earlier that it is not a big fan of what it describes as \u201cbehavioral remedies.\u201d So if the division does find grounds to sue, it will need to be sure that a structural remedy will be the ultimate result. At worst, the FTC and DOJ could force a divestiture similar to the federal ruling in the Microsoft case. However, according to McCareins, divestitures do not always work to quell anticompetitive behavior in a timely manner, especially in markets where technological change is rampant. In 1984, for example, the federal government broke AT&T into eight regional telecom providers, which became known as the \u201cBaby Bells.\u201d But those companies have since been reunited through a series of mergers and acquisitions.

Economy-wide growth is generally caused by new products or processes that have an impact on a wide variety of sectors in the economy, as was the case with the rise of electricity and computers. These are what macroeconomists call general purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs are characterized by three core qualities:", "\u2022 They are pervasive in that they spread into many sectors.", "\u2022 They improve over time and should keep lowering the cost to their users.", "\u2022 They make it easier to spawn innovation through the invention and production of new products or processes. (Grossman and Helpman 1991)", "Ruttan (2006) argues that large-scale and long-term government investment has been the engine behind almost every GPT in the last century. He analysed the development of six different technology complexes (the US \u2018mass production\u2019 system, aviation technologies, space technologies, information technology, Internet technologies and nuclear power) and concluded that government investments have been important in bringing these new technologies into being. He adds that nuclear power would most probably not have been developed at all in the absence of large government investments. In each case successful development of new technology complexes was not just a result of funding and creating the right conditions for innovation. Equally important was setting up specific institutions to envision the opportunity space, engage in the riskiest and most uncertain early research and oversee the commercialization process (Ruttan 2006). In Chapter 4, I will show that the same has been the case for the recent development of nanotechnology, which many believe is the next GPT. ", "Examples of the leading role played by the US government in technology development in fact abound. Lazonick (2013) presents a compelling summary of cases where the US Developmental State played a prominent role, ranging from land freely handed to private companies for the construction of railroads and the financial support of agricultural research in the nineteenth century; through the funding, support and active development of the aeronautical, space and aircraft industries in the twentieth century; to R&D grants and other types of finance for life sciences, nanotechnology and clean energy industries in the twenty-first century. ", "Abbate\u2019s (1999) extensive research shows how the Internet grew out of the small Defense Department network project (ARPANET) of connecting a dozen research sites in the US into a network linking millions of computers and billions of people. Leslie (2000) argues that while Silicon Valley has been an attractive and influential model for regional development, it has been difficult to copy it, because almost every advocate of the Silicon Valley model tells a story of \u2018freewheeling entrepreneurs and visionary venture capitalists\u2019 and yet misses the crucial factor: the military\u2019s role in creating and sustaining it. Leslie shows that \u2018Silicon Valley owes its present configuration to patterns of federal spending, corporate strategies, industry\u2013university relationships, and technological innovation shaped by the assumptions and priorities of Cold War defense policy\u2019 (Leslie 2000, 49). Notwithstanding the Silicon Valley model still lingers in the collective imagination of policy makers as a place where VC created a revolution. The 1999 National Research Council report Funding a Revolution: Government Support for Computing Research is in fact an attempt to recall and acknowledge the major role the US federal government has played in launching and giving momentum to the computer revolution. We look at this further below. ", "Given the leading developmental role the US government plays in a vast number of sectors, it is no surprise that at a more micro level, Block and Keller (2011b) found that between 1971 and 2006, 77 out of the most important 88 innovations (rated by R&D Magazine\u2019s annual awards)\u2014or 88 percent\u2014have been fully dependent on federal research support, especially, but not only, in their early phases\u2014and the R&D Magazine\u2019s award excludes IT innovations.

There is a whole literature devoted to the role of the so-called Developmental State, where the State is active not only in Keynesian demand management but also in leading the process of industrialization. The most typical examples are the East Asian economies, which through planning and active industrial policy were able to \u2018catch up\u2019 technologically and economically with the West (Amsden 1989). In states that were late to industrialize, the State itself led the industrialization drive. It took on developmental functions, for example by targeting certain sectors for investment, placed barriers to foreign competition until such time as companies in the targeted sectors were ready to export, and then provided assistance finding new export markets for companies. In Japan, for example, Johnson (1982) illustrates how the MITI worked to coordinate Japanese firms in new international markets. This occurred through investments made in particular technologies (picking winners), and the creation of specific business strategies meant to win particular domestic and international markets. Furthermore, the Japanese State coordinated the finance system through the Bank of Japan as well as through the Fiscal Investment Loan Program (funded by the postal savings system).", "Chang (2008) offers similar illustrations for South Korea and other recently emerged economies. China has engaged in a targeted industrialization strategy too, only joining the World Trade Organisation once its industries were ready to compete, rather than as part of an International Monetary Fund\u2013backed industrialization strategy. The Chinese strategy showed the weaknesses of the Washington Consensus on development, which denied the State the active role that it played in the development of major industrialized nations such as the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom (Chang 2002; Reinert 2007). ", "If there is strong evidence that the State can be effective in pursuing targeted catch-up policies by focusing resources on being dominant in certain industrial sectors, why is it not accepted that the State can have a greater role in the development of new technologies and applications beyond simply funding basic science and having an infrastructure to support private sector activity?", ""], "id": "15985d44fc0164d11d404ab1293c89fb9ef7200a3cc554eca3f9f96c64865e76", "highlighted_text": " examples are East Asia which \u2018 catch  up \u2019 technologically by targeting sectors for investment Japan pick winners and win international markets .

Used in tandem with long-term storage measures and diverse energy sources, microgrids can provide continuous energy in the case of multi-day outages; for example, a microgrid installation at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station that uses a mix of generators, battery storage, and solar photovoltaics can supply power to the base for up to three weeks.

Military investment has historically spurred civilian adoption down the line, furthering climate resilience efforts.

Power is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted formula exists. Perhaps overall military spending might be thought of as a proxy for hard power capabilities; perhaps too the amount of money the United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of the unipole. When compared to conflict levels, however, there is no obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative relationship between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic stability theorists would expect to see. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on defense by about 25 percent, spending $100 billion less in real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 To those believers in the neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible \u201cpeace dividend\u201d endangered both national and global security. \u201cNo serious analyst of American military capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America\u2019s responsibilities to itself and to world peace,\u201d argued Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 The world grew dramatically more peaceful while the United States cut its forces, however, and stayed just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the military budget was cut under President Clinton, in other words, and kept declining (though more slowly, since levels were already low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up. Overall US military spending has varied during the period of the New Peace from a low in constant dollars of less than $400 billion to a high of more than $700 billion, but war does not seem to have noticed. The same nonrelationship exists between other potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict: there does not seem to be much connection between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP, alliance commitments, and forward military presence. There was very little fighting in Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there, for example, and that has not changed as the number of Americans dwindled by 90 percent. Overall, there does not seem to be much correlation between US actions and systemic stability. Nothing the United States actually does seems to matter to the New Peace.", ""], "id": "6e96b78270fe140c6be19cc2a064f5510b5adac9ea4f94eff0eefe5ad590bdaa", "highlighted_text": " polarity conflict levels there is no correlation the U S cut defense by 25 percent The world grew more peaceful The same nonrelationship exists between US GDP alliance s and military presence", "highlights": [[2, 21, 29], [2, 420, 435], [2, 446, 457], [2, 466, 477], [2, 643, 648], [2, 654, 655], [2, 661, 664], [2, 673, 683], [2, 690, 700], [2, 1147, 1161], [2, 1175, 1188], [2, 1781, 1789], [2, 1790, 1805], [2, 1806, 1820], [2, 1961, 1967], [2, 1969, 1977], [2, 1988, 1989], [2, 1991, 1994], [2, 2003, 2020]], "underlines": [[2, 21, 29], [2, 37, 39], [2, 54, 70], [2, 91, 121], [2, 403, 407], [2, 408, 419], [2, 420, 435], [2, 446, 457], [2, 466, 477], [2, 625, 642], [2, 643, 648], [2, 654, 655], [2, 661, 664], [2, 665, 672], [2, 673, 683], [2, 690, 700], [2, 1147, 1161], [2, 1162, 1174], [2, 1174, 1174], [2, 1175, 1188], [2, 1189, 1200], [2, 1206, 1207], [2, 1213, 1227], [2, 1581, 1583], [2, 1584, 1601], [2, 1606, 1612], [2, 1613, 1623], [2, 1634, 1647], [2, 1742, 1779], [2, 1781, 1789], [2, 1790, 1805], [2, 1806, 1820], [2, 1821, 1826], [2, 1827, 1836], [2, 1836, 1836], [2, 1837, 1842], [2, 1843, 1855], [2, 1856, 1863], [2, 1869, 1881], [2, 1883, 1908], [2, 1908, 1908], [2, 1914, 1924], [2, 1924, 1924], [2, 1925, 1932], [2, 1933, 1960], [2, 1961, 1967], [2, 1967, 1968], [2, 1969, 1977], [2, 1978, 1988], [2, 1988, 1989], [2, 1989, 1990], [2, 1990, 1990], [2, 1991, 1994], [2, 1995, 2002], [2, 2003, 2020], [2, 2022, 2031], [2, 2037, 2106], [2, 2127, 2187], [2, 2188, 2201], [2, 2212, 2277], [2, 2277, 2277], [2, 2278, 2311], [2, 2317, 2318], [2, 2333, 2353]], "emphasis": [[2, 446, 457], [2, 466, 477]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 8], [9, 12]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2017-01-01"}, {"tag": "The valley of death kills all innovative ideas", "cite": "Johnson & Gruber 19 (Simon Johnson is the Ronald A.

Research is carried out by technical experts who are excited by discovery. However, the ultimate good that emerges from this process of discovery requires much more than just an excited scientist; it requires the ability to turn that discovery into a new technology, then into a new product, and finally into a sale to consumers. These are steps that go beyond the training and skill level of the basic scientists doing the discovery, and they require financing. Taking an idea from the lab to the store is expensive.", "In our economy, turning a good idea into a product is exactly what should be financed by private capital. Private capitalists should be able to provide both the funding and expertise to help scientists take their ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace. Indeed, the United States has a successful venture capital (VC) industry with a long and impressive track record of doing so. But this industry has fallen short when it comes to maximizing the entrepreneurial\u2014and economic growth\u2014-potential of new technologies.", "The VC industry has been an important player in our economy for decades. Early VC was closely associated with technology companies, so it makes sense that the growth of the VC industry beginning in the early 1970s has become linked to Sand Hill Road, in Menlo Park, California, which hosted firms like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia. Virtually every major player in Silicon Valley received money from a Sand Hill Road firm.49 In 1973, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) was formed. By the early 1990s, nearly half of venture money was going to the West Coast.50", "The VC industry has been a clear success story in terms of promoting the growth of technology companies in the United States. The examples are legendary; Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Intel, and many more of the leading companies in the United States were funded at their early stages by venture capital. Sixty percent of all companies who had an initial public offering (IPO) between 1999 and 2009 had venture backing.51 In 2014, 17 percent of US public corporations had started with VC backing, representing 21 percent of the entire capitalization of publicly traded companies in the country.52", "That said, the VC industry faces three defining constraints. The first is that the people who run these funds are investing in an exceedingly risky environment. Even after a rigorous process of culling thousands of proposals to the few that get funded, most venture-backed investments fail. Data from a leading venture investing firm show that 8 percent of their investment dollars resulted in more than 70 percent of the overall returns of the portfolio, while 60 percent of the investment dollars were spent on projects that were ultimately terminated below the cost of the investment.53", "The second is that VCs are ultimately investing in something that is largely out of their control. Venture investors are relying on entrepreneurs to put in the incredibly hard work required to take a product from idea to market. There is a legitimate concern that those who are the best inventors may not be ideally suited to put in that effort. If VCs invest a lot of money in a good idea and the entrepreneur is not dedicated or skilled enough to turn this into a productive company, then the venture capitalists have a failed investment on their hands.", "The final constraint is that the pool of investors willing to risk their money on very early-stage enterprises is actually quite limited. Only one-sixth of 1 percent of new start-ups each year get venture backing. The amount of actual capital that is committed to backing venture capital partnerships has typically been around 0.2 percent of the value of the US stock market.54 In other words, while the $76 billion in venture commitments in 2016 may seem large in absolute dollars, it is tiny compared both to the multitrillion-dollar size of our financial markets and to the requests for start-up funds by hundreds of thousands of firms each year.55 Venture investments amounted to only 2.5 percent of gross domestic private investment in the United States in 2016.56", "To attract and disburse these limited dollars, venture capitalists have developed two investing approaches that make sense from their perspective\u2014but that also explain a great deal about the limitations of the existing venture capital industry as a catalyst for economic growth.57", "The first is to pay entrepreneurs in proportion to the actual commercial success of the product. That is, while VCs can\u2019t tell how much effort the entrepreneurs are making, they can use the signal sent by the market as to whether the process was a success. So entrepreneur earnings are not proportional to their effort but rather to their market success.", "This strategy makes a great deal of sense for the venture capitalists\u2014but it places a lot of risk on the entrepreneur. The inventor could genuinely put in enormous effort only to, through no fault of their own, have the market not value their contribution. And individuals, with their limited budgets, are not in a good position to bear this risk.", "If you look only at the experience of successful entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, entrepreneurship appears to be a high-return activity, but in reality, most new start-up firms yield no meaningful value to entrepreneurs, and most of the total value to entrepreneurs comes from the tiny fraction of ventures that is wildly successful.58", "After accounting for risk, the return on starting a company is not high for the typical entrepreneur. A comprehensive study gathered data on the income earned by entrepreneurs and their risk of success and failure. The study concluded that if a worker is well paid and does not have millions of their own assets to put at risk, they will be better off staying at their job than striking out on their own.59 Consequently, many potential entrepreneurs do not go forward with their ideas because they cannot afford the risk of failure.

Early exits are preferred in order to establish a winning track record and raise a follow-on fund. This creates a situation whereby venture capital funds therefore have a bias towards investing in projects where the commercial viability is established within a three- to five- year period (Ghosh and Nanda 2010). Although this is sometimes possible (e.g. Google), it is often not. In the case of an emerging sector like biotech or green tech today, where the underlying knowledge base is still in its early exploratory phase, such a short-term bias is damaging to the scientific exploration process, which requires longer time horizons and tolerance of failure. Venture capital has succeeded more in the US when it provided not only committed finance, but managerial expertise and the construction of a viable organization (Lazonick 2012).

Crowding out is a hypothesis in economics that says that the danger of State investment is that it uses up savings that could have been used by the private sector for its own investment plans (Friedman 1979). Keynesians have argued against the idea that State spending crowds out private investment by emphasizing that this would only hold in a period of full resource utilization, a state that hardly ever occurs. However, the issues raised in this book present a different view: that an entrepreneurial State invests in areas that the private sector would not invest in even if it had the resources. And it is the courageous risk-taking visionary role of the State that has been ignored. Business investment is mainly limited not by savings but by its own lack of courage (or Keynesian \u2018animal spirits\u2019)\u2014the \u2018business as usual\u2019 state of mind. Indeed, firm-level studies have show that what drives entry behaviour into industries (companies deciding to move into one particular sector) is not existing profits in that sector but projected technological and market opportunities (Dosi et al. 1997). And such opportunities are linked to the amount of State investment in those areas.

It suggests that leaders who are worried about their popularity at home will try to divert attention from their failures by provoking a crisis with a foreign power and maybe even using force against it. Drawing on this logic, some Americans now worry that President Donald Trump will decide to attack a country like Iran or Venezuela in the run-up to the presidential election and especially if he thinks he\u2019s likely to lose. This outcome strikes me as unlikely, even if one ignores the logical and empirical flaws in the theory itself. War is always a gamble, and should things go badly\u2014even a little bit\u2014it would hammer the last nail in the coffin of Trump\u2019s declining fortunes. Moreover, none of the countries Trump might consider going after pose an imminent threat to U.S. security, and even his staunchest supporters may wonder why he is wasting time and money going after Iran or Venezuela at a moment when thousands of Americans are dying preventable deaths at home. Even a successful military action won\u2019t put Americans back to work, create the sort of testing-and-tracing regime that competent governments around the world have been able to implement already, or hasten the development of a vaccine. The same logic is likely to guide the decisions of other world leaders too. Another familiar folk theory is \u201cmilitary Keynesianism.\u201d War generates a lot of economic demand, and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of the doldrums and back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious case in point here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy finally escape the quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are convinced that great powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or the arms industry) happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument, and they might worry that governments looking at bleak economic forecasts will try to restart their economies through some sort of military adventure. I doubt it. It takes a really big war to generate a significant stimulus, and it is hard to imagine any country launching a large-scale war\u2014with all its attendant risks\u2014at a moment when debt levels are already soaring. More importantly, there are lots of easier and more direct ways to stimulate the economy\u2014infrastructure spending, unemployment insurance, even \u201chelicopter payments\u201d\u2014and launching a war has to be one of the least efficient methods available. The threat of war usually spooks investors too, which any politician with their eye on the stock market would be loath to do. Economic downturns can encourage war in some special circumstances, especially when a war would enable a country facing severe hardships to capture something of immediate and significant value. Saddam Hussein\u2019s decision to seize Kuwait in 1990 fits this model perfectly: The Iraqi economy was in terrible shape after its long war with Iran; unemployment was threatening Saddam\u2019s domestic position; Kuwait\u2019s vast oil riches were a considerable prize; and seizing the lightly armed emirate was exceedingly easy to do. Iraq also owed Kuwait a lot of money, and a hostile takeover by Baghdad would wipe those debts off the books overnight. In this case, Iraq\u2019s parlous economic condition clearly made war more likely. Yet I cannot think of any country in similar circumstances today. Now is hardly the time for Russia to try to grab more of Ukraine\u2014if it even wanted to\u2014or for China to make a play for Taiwan, because the costs of doing so would clearly outweigh the economic benefits. Even conquering an oil-rich country\u2014the sort of greedy acquisitiveness that Trump occasionally hints at\u2014doesn\u2019t look attractive when there\u2019s a vast glut on the market. I might be worried if some weak and defenseless country somehow came to possess the entire global stock of a successful coronavirus vaccine, but that scenario is not even remotely possible. If one takes a longer-term perspective, however, a sustained economic depression could make war more likely by strengthening fascist or xenophobic political movements, fueling protectionism and hypernationalism, and making it more difficult for countries to reach mutually acceptable bargains with each other. The history of the 1930s shows where such trends can lead, although the economic effects of the Depression are hardly the only reason world politics took such a deadly turn in the 1930s. Nationalism, xenophobia, and authoritarian rule were making a comeback well before COVID-19 struck, but the economic misery now occurring in every corner of the world could intensify these trends and leave us in a more war-prone condition when fear of the virus has diminished. On balance, however, I do not think that even the extraordinary economic conditions we are witnessing today are going to have much impact on the likelihood of war. Why? First of all, if depressions were a powerful cause of war, there would be a lot more of the latter. To take one example, the United States has suffered 40 or more recessions since the country was founded, yet it has fought perhaps 20 interstate wars, most of them unrelated to the state of the economy.

What is more realistic is for a cyber attack to cripple [devastate] an individual utility, causing a blackout or disruption of service at the local level.\u00b6 The power grid is vulnerable to attack \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that. In my own work, testing the security readiness of US and global energy companies and utilities, I regularly find serious vulnerabilities on these networks and I am often called in to deal with compromises that have already taken place \u2014 including cyber-espionage activities by state-sponsored groups.\u00b6 Adm. Rogers testimony is extremely important as it provides a strong authoritative voice to what is an urgent problem facing this country right now: America\u2019s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to attack, it\u2019s a complicated problem to fix it and an attack is eminent.

That means hackers would have to tunnel into hundreds of diverse networks, which would take several years, and then write custom exploits which are unique for each specific environment they\u2019re targeting. For those who would argue that China or Russia have the money, time and capability to do that, try to understand that developing a functional exploit, getting it placed on the exact part of the network that it needs to be on in order to have the desired effect (i.e., specific programmable logic controllers that run the utility\u2019s machinery), then keeping it hidden on that network over a period of months or years while security teams try to hunt it down, and doing all of this at the same time on hundreds of networks is extremely difficult.

Figure 1), detonated in any large capital city of the developed world, would cause an unprecedented catastrophic scenario. An estimate of direct effects in the attack\u2019s location includes a death toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000peopleinjured,dependingonthetarget\u2019s geography and population density. Total physical destruction of the city\u2019s infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave)andthermalradiation,wouldcoveraradiusofabout 500 meters from the point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing radiation greater than 5 Sieverts \u2013 compatible with the deadly acute radiation syndrome \u2013 would expand within an 850-meter radius. From the environmental point of view, such an area would be unusable for years. In addition, radioactive fallout would expandinanareaofabout300squarekilometers,depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target country, however, and promptly propagate worldwide. Global and national security, economy and finance, international governance and its framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments and individuals would all be put under severe trial. The severity of the effects at a national level, however, would depend on the countries\u2019 level of development, geopolitical location, and resilience. Global security and regional/national defense schemes would be strongly affected. An increase in global distrust would spark rising tensions among countries and blocs, that could even lead to the brink of nuclear weapons use by states (if, for instance, a sponsor country is identified). The consequences of such a shocking scenario would include a decrease in states\u2019 self-control, an escalation of present conflicts and the emergence of new ones, accompanied by an increase in military unilateralism and military expenditures. Regarding the economic and financial impacts, a severe global economic depression would rise from the attack, likely lasting for years. Its duration would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the two years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also include a shortage of high-technology products such as medicines, as well as a fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of international humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We expect an increase of unemployment and poverty in all countries. Global poverty would raise about 4 percent after the attack, which implies that at least 30 million more people would be living in extreme poverty, in addition to the current estimated 767 million. In the area of international relations, we would expect a breakdown of key doctrines involving politics, security, and relations among states. These international tensions could lead to a collapse of the nuclear order as we know it today, with a consequent setback of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation commitments. In other words, the whole system based on the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty would be put under severe trial. After the attack, there would be a reassessment of existing security doctrines, and a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse, proportionality, and negative security assurances.

That raises the stakes for everyone ) NAR", "body": ["Ransomware attacks are a potential danger for any organisation, with ransomware variants including Conti, Egregor, Maze and many others still successfully compromising victims across all industries \u2013 but there are some industries that criminal gangs are targeting more than others. The ransomware attacks are successful because many organisations can't afford for their network to be out of service for a sustained period of time, so many businesses are still taking what they perceive to be the quickest and easier route to restoring the network by giving into the ransom demands of criminals. A recent report by cybersecurity company Digital Shadows examined which industries were most targeted by ransomware during 2020. While almost every industry found itself dealing with ransomware gangs over the course of the past 12 months, industrial goods and services was the most targeted, accounting for 29% \u2013 or almost one in three \u2013 ransomware attacks. SEE: Security Awareness and Training policy (TechRepublic Premium) That number of attacks is more than those on the next three most targeted sectors \u2013 construction, technology and retail \u2013 combined. Manufacturers and infrastructure can make a tempting targeted for ransomware attacks because the organisations in these sectors need to be in operation around the clock, whether that's running a factory production line or operating a utilities plant. If they can't provide these services, there can be wide-ranging impacts further down the supply chain. \"Industrial organisations will feel more pressure to pay the ransom as periods of inoperability have significant impacts to their customers. This may result in a perception that organizations in this area are more likely to pay a ransom demand compared to organizations in other sectors,\" says Jamie Hart, cyber-threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows. Also, these systems also tend to be in constant use, which can create another problem because operators may be reluctant to take them offline to apply the steady flow of routine software patches necessary to protect against security vulnerabilities that can give ransomware gangs access in the first place. That's if the machines can receive security updates at all because obsolete, unsupported technology is still common in many industrial environments. \"Organisations in this vertical are heavily reliant on systems that are outdated and thus require significant efforts to maintain vulnerability management. Additionally, these systems are so vital to the day-to-day operations of these organizations taking them offline for patching is a significant undertaking,\" says Hart. This reliance on older systems and the need for constant uptime, therefore, makes industrial plants tempting victims for ransomware attacks. For the cyber criminals, it's all about the money and they're targeting factories because they know there's money to be made, potentially against a soft target that will be willing to pay up. \"Ransoming an enterprise, that's one thing. Ransoming an industrial plant that has a 15-million-a-day production line that would be affected by downtime, that's another,\" says Rob Lee, CEO and co-founder of Dragos, a company specialising in industrial cybersecurity.\"It will be extremely enticing for ransomware operators.\" Most ransomeware will target the PCs and servers on the business network (which is often enough to shut down operations), but some are going further to target the industrial systems too. There are some specialist ransomware operations that are looking to take attacks even further in their quest to make money, such as ransomware variants like EKANS, which are specifically designed to target industrial control systems (ICS). The prospect of ransomware encrypting ICS systems in factories is a worrying prospect, but there's also the potential these gangs could target critical infrastructure and attempt to hold energy, water and other utilities hostage. These aren't products that organisations and individuals could go without for a few days \u2013 if a cyber criminal has the ability to shut down the power of a city, the impact is going to be felt far and wide.", ""], "id": "1cf4c5534d549ee64e41bb60bd6a38ee25f9b9867dacaf84c3d4fad756674b9f", "highlighted_text": " Ransomware attacks are a danger for all industries but industrial goods and services was the most targeted there can be wide-ranging impacts down the supply chain Industrial organisations will feel more pressure Organisations are heavily reliant on systems that are outdated and vulnerabil Ransoming an industrial plant that has a 15-million-a-day production will be extremely enticing for ransomware operators gangs could target critical infrastructure and hold energy, water and other utilities hostage the impact is felt far and wide", "highlights": [[2, 0, 24], [2, 35, 45], [2, 183, 197], [2, 200, 203], [2, 834, 885], [2, 1441, 1453], [2, 1454, 1474], [2, 1483, 1504], [2, 1507, 1517], [2, 1518, 1531], [2, 1532, 1555], [2, 2323, 2336], [2, 2354, 2389], [2, 2390, 2402], [2, 2403, 2406], [2, 2452, 2462], [2, 3023, 3091], [2, 3249, 3300], [2, 3854, 3865], [2, 3866, 3872], [2, 3873, 3900], [2, 3912, 3958], [2, 4121, 4134], [2, 4147, 4164]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 24], [2, 25, 34], [2, 35, 45], [2, 183, 197], [2, 200, 203], [2, 834, 885], [2, 885, 886], [2, 1322, 1440], [2, 1441, 1453], [2, 1454, 1474], [2, 1475, 1482], [2, 1482, 1482], [2, 1483, 1504], [2, 1504, 1505], [2, 1505, 1505], [2, 1507, 1517], [2, 1518, 1531], [2, 1532, 1555], [2, 1556, 1601], [2, 1602, 1646], [2, 1872, 2321], [2, 2321, 2321], [2, 2323, 2336], [2, 2337, 2353], [2, 2354, 2389], [2, 2390, 2402], [2, 2403, 2406], [2, 2407, 2451], [2, 2452, 2462], [2, 2462, 2477], [2, 2663, 2676], [2, 2722, 2727], [2, 2728, 2777], [2, 3023, 3091], [2, 3092, 3093], [2, 3245, 3248], [2, 3248, 3248], [2, 3249, 3300], [2, 3300, 3302], [2, 3829, 3853], [2, 3854, 3865], [2, 3865, 3865], [2, 3866, 3872], [2, 3873, 3900], [2, 3901, 3908], [2, 3909, 3911], [2, 3912, 3958], [2, 3958, 3959], [2, 3959, 3959], [2, 4054, 4055], [2, 4056, 4070], [2, 4071, 4120], [2, 4121, 4134], [2, 4135, 4146], [2, 4147, 4164], [2, 4164, 4165]], "emphasis": [[2, 200, 203], [2, 834, 885], [2, 885, 886], [2, 1454, 1474], [2, 1475, 1482], [2, 1482, 1482], [2, 1483, 1504], [2, 1504, 1505], [2, 1602, 1646], [2, 2390, 2402], [2, 2452, 2462], [2, 2462, 2477], [2, 2728, 2777], [2, 3873, 3900], [2, 3901, 3908], [2, 3909, 3911], [2, 3912, 3958], [2, 3958, 3959], [2, 3959, 3959]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2021-01-01"}, {"tag": "Link alone turns case, zeroing enforcement and encouraging anticompetitive behavior.", "cite": "Baker 20 (Jonathan Baker, Bill Baer, Michael Kades, Fiona Morton, Nancy Rose, Carl Shapiro, Tim Wu; Professor of  Law at American University, former Director of the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission, Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University, J.D. from Harvard University; Visiting Fellow in Governance Studies, former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the U.S. Department of Justice and Director of the Bureau of Competition at the Federal Trade Commission, J.D. from Stanford University; Director of Markets and Competition Policy at the Equitable Growth Foundation, J.D. from the University of Wisconsin; Professor of Economics at ale University, Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Professor of Applied Economics, Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Professor of Business Strategy at the University of California, Berkeley; Special Assistant to the President for Technology and Competition Policy in the National Economic Council, J.D. from Harvard Law School, \u201cRestoring competition in the United States,\u201d Washington Center for Equitable Growth.

WHY IT MATTERS As senior officials told Bing, the DOJ's move to shift ransomware response illustrates how the issue is being prioritized. It will mean that the agency expects U.S. attorney's office investigators to share case details and other information with leaders in Washington. \"We've used this model around terrorism before, but never with ransomware,\" said Justice Department Principle Associate Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. Other investigations that will also trigger similar notifications now include cases involving counter-antivirus services, botnets and other tools used by hackers. The guidance follows a Thursday letter from National Security Council Cybersecurity Advisor Anne Neuberger to corporate executives and business leaders, noting the rise in ransomware attacks and advising organizations to beef up their protection against them. The letter outlines best practices for companies, including routine backups and patches, multifactor authentication, endpoint detection and response, encryption, and the employment of a skilled security team.

Or, at least more seriously. So reports Reuters, which on Thursday noted that the DOJ is \"elevating investigations of ransomware attacks to a similar priority as terrorism.\" This move, in part, will involve coordinating responses to ransomware with a single task force in Washington D.C. Ransomware is a form of digital extortion that involves encrypting a victim's files and then offering to provide a decryption key for a price, typically paid in cryptocurrency. Thursday's news was well received by experts in the cybersecurity field. Chris Krebs, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (who was notoriously fired by tweet), called out DOJ's effort as a step in the right direction. \"This is a positive indication that we're getting serious about stopping ransomware,\" he wrote Thursday. \"Much more needs to be done, but directional shifts are a good thing.\" Jackie Singh, a former senior cybersecurity staffer in the Biden campaign, explained what the DOJ's move means in practice. \"Centralizing the data and clarifying the reporting structure means more effective information sharing between disparate agencies on a topic of growing importance and recognized risk, primarily due to the disruption at Colonial Pipeline, but also based on the hundreds of ransomware incidents which pose mounting threats to Americans,\" she wrote over direct message.

Part of it may be concern about the difficulty in obtaining custody of the perpetrators.

To be sure, a high-profile data breach is visible and will command resources. But those resources tend to go into investigating the perpetrators of that particular hack, not into launching long-term, proactive investigations into all the cybercrime-as-a-service organizations that contribute to global hacking in larger, if less measurable ways. Part of the problem is that each U.S. attorney\u2019s office and each FBI field office has responsibility over a particular territory. Thus, a U.S. attorney will (understandably) be most concerned about catching the perpetrators of a ransomware attack committed against a company in his or her district. But, as noted above, the hackers who commit the ransomware attacks are like street-level drug dealers, not kingpins. And U.S. attorneys have much less incentive to spend scarce resources on long-term investigations into Russian-based cybercrime services with slight connections to their districts and a small chance of producing arrests in the near future. The department does have a centralized computer crimes section, CCIPS, which provides training and assistance to cyber prosecutors and has partnered with U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in many successful cybercrime-as-a-service cases, including the ones discussed in this post. But CCIPS\u2019s approximately 45 attorneys spend much of their time conducting training, providing advice, building relationships with foreign partners and advocating important policy changes.

Why it matters: A wave of mega-mergers touching many facets of daily life, from T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint to CVS\u2019s purchase of Aetna, will test the Justice Department's and Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to examine smaller or more novel cases, antitrust experts say. What they\u2019re saying: \u201cYou have finite resources in terms of people power, so if you are spending all of your time litigating big mergers \u2026 there might be some investigations where decisions might have to be made about which investigations you can pursue,\u201d said Caroline Holland, who was a senior staffer in DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division under President Obama and is now a Mozilla fellow. What's happening: More mergers are underway now than at any point since the recession. The total number of transactions reported to the federal government in fiscal year 2017, and not including cases given expedited approval or where the agencies couldn't legally pursue an investigation, is 82% higher than the number reported in 2010 and 55% higher than the number reported in 2012. Funding for antitrust officials who weigh the deals hasn\u2019t kept pace. The funding for the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division has fallen 10% since 2010, when adjusted for inflation. That's in line with the broader picture: not adjusting for inflation, the Department's overall budget increased just slightly in 2016 and 2017. Funding for the FTC has fallen 5% since 2010 (adjusted for inflation). An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on funding levels and Antitrust Division officials didn't provide a comment. Driving the news: Merger and acquisition activity is up 36% in the United States compared to the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters data from April. Several deals under government review have gotten national attention, including Sinclair\u2019s purchase of Tribune's TV stations or T-Mobile\u2019s deal with Sprint, which stands to reduce the number of national wireless providers from four to three.

Brown. 43 Parker involved an antitrust challenge to a California regulatory scheme (an output reducing raisin prorate program) that set up a raisin cartel. According to the Court\u2019s opinion, ninety-five percent of U.S. raisins and half of the world\u2019s raisins were grown in California and subject to the state\u2019s anticompetitive prorate program. Moreover, more than ninety percent of the output was shipped through interstate or foreign commerce to consumers outside California. As a result, instate private interests (California raisin growers) captured the vast majority of the benefits of the resulting anticompetitive price increase while ninety percent of the anticompetitive effect (of increased prices) was exported to consumers outside of California. The decision in Parker demonstrates that despite the fact that the state clearly articulated its anticompetitive intentions and actively supervised the cartel, the politicians and voters in the State of California may very well have still approved of the scheme. However, an alternative approach would focus upon the extent to which the effects of anticompetitive state regulations spillover to other states. Easterbrook would replace the Court\u2019s current approach with a single rule that would allow states and local jurisdictions to adopt any regulation they choose, if and only if the anticompetitive effects of the regulation are internalized by residents of that state.44 By focusing solely on the incidence of the anticompetitive overcharge, this approach would be more administrable than attempting to address such regulations through the dormant Commerce Clause and the difficult balancing tests it requires.45 The California raisin prorate program at issue in Parker clearly would fail this test and be subject to antitrust scrutiny. Exclusive focus on the jurisdictional incidence of anticompetitive effects, however, might also result in many of the anticompetitive regulations previously denied immunity by the Court receiving state action protection (e.g., Phoebe Putney,where the anticompetitive price effect of a \u201chospital authority\u201d monopolizing hospital services in a particular region of the state would be felt exclusively in-state). Accordingly, the substantive policy of the antitrust laws, the Commerce Clause, and other constitutional provisions that limit state economic parochialism might be advanced even more effectively by a hybrid approach: Anticompetitive state action meeting the criteria of the current state action doctrine would be immune from antitrust attack unless the anticompetitive effects of the state action are predominantly exported. This approach would safeguard the sovereign prerogatives of the states where they seek to supervise the local anticompetitive aspects of displacing competition, while still recognizing the clear exception identified in Parker (prohibiting mere authorization of private restraint) and protecting the federal interest in an integrated national economy. Using these insights, the Department of Justice could encourage the Court to revisit and supplement its current criteria for state action immunity by either initiating its own cases or filing amicus briefs in private cases. For example, the Department could challenge a state regulatory regime that meets the Court\u2019s current criteria for immunity \u2013 clear articulation and active supervision \u2013 but has anticompetitive effects felt predominantly beyond the borders of the regulating state. In either endeavor, however, the Department could aim to persuade the Court to impose a third condition for state action immunity (i.e., the lack of substantial out-of-state anticompetitive effects)."], "id": "7a86c241dfb0fb1c8a45f5b0a3840a8afd4f0fbefe095b0a292ae571a456838f", "highlighted_text": " Parker demonstrates despite anticompetitive intentions politicians approved an alternative approach would focus which effects of anticompetitive state regulations spillover to other states the Department of Justice could encourage the Court to revisit its current criteria for state action by either initiating its own cases or filing amicus briefs in private cases the Department could challenge a state regulatory regime that meets the Court\u2019s current criteria for immunity but has anticompetitive effects beyond the borders of the state", "highlights": [[2, 870, 889], [2, 895, 902], [2, 951, 977], [2, 1018, 1029], [2, 1093, 1101], [2, 1126, 1161], [2, 1181, 1186], [2, 1191, 1261], [2, 3104, 3166], [2, 3182, 3219], [2, 3229, 3304], [2, 3319, 3428], [2, 3475, 3506], [2, 3526, 3551], [2, 3563, 3568]], "underlines": [[2, 854, 869], [2, 870, 889], [2, 890, 894], [2, 895, 902], [2, 903, 926], [2, 926, 926], [2, 927, 950], [2, 951, 977], [2, 978, 1017], [2, 1017, 1017], [2, 1018, 1029], [2, 1030, 1092], [2, 1093, 1101], [2, 1102, 1108], [2, 1108, 1108], [2, 1109, 1116], [2, 1116, 1116], [2, 1124, 1125], [2, 1126, 1161], [2, 1162, 1180], [2, 1181, 1186], [2, 1187, 1190], [2, 1191, 1261], [2, 2523, 2551], [2, 2551, 2551], [2, 2552, 2640], [2, 2640, 2640], [2, 2641, 2730], [2, 2730, 2730], [2, 2731, 2801], [2, 2892, 2903], [2, 2903, 2903], [2, 2904, 2956], [2, 3082, 3103], [2, 3104, 3166], [2, 3167, 3181], [2, 3182, 3219], [2, 3220, 3228], [2, 3229, 3304], [2, 3319, 3428], [2, 3428, 3428], [2, 3475, 3506], [2, 3526, 3551], [2, 3552, 3562], [2, 3563, 3568]], "emphasis": [], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 16]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-03-18"}, {"tag": "It would require so many resources as to necessitate a NEW AGENCY", "cite": "Scheffler \u201919, Professor of Law at Yale (Gabriel, \u201c Unlocking Access to Health Care: A Federalist Approach to Reforming Occupational Licensing\u201d, https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hmax29&div=9&id=&page=)", "body": ["Finally, a federalist approach would enable the federal government to take advantage of states\u2019 institutional experience in regulating occupations, and to avoid having to create an equivalent institutional apparatus at the federal level.

To pick a recent example, consider the proposed merger of two hospital systems in the Memphis area, which the FTC filed to block in November 2020. Based on the FTC\u2019s complaint, the merger would have reduced the number of competing systems from four to three and created a system with over a 50 percent market share. In the face of litigation, the parties abandoned the deal\u2014consistent with this being a straightforward case. Although the FTC prevailed without a trial, it took nearly a year from the merger announcement to the abandonment. Over that period, the FTC likely devoted thousands of staff hours to the investigation and lawsuit and expended substantial taxpayer resources on expert witnesses.

History certainly lends support to this concern. Congress has been hostile to an activist FTC in the past and could be expected to move to rein in any activism.

Congress asserted new power over the agency and imposed additional procedural conditions on the use of its consumer protection authority.254", "This fear of a political backlash from business and Congress may be the strongest line of criticism of an expansive Section 5.

Congressional Republicans, with the support of some Democrats, have been trying to hobble the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d).256 The CFPB is seen as aggressively pursuing its statutory mission, bringing a wide range of enforcement actions and writing a number of rules to regulate consumer finance markets.257 In light of its vigor, the opposition from Congress does not come as a surprise.

Corporate interests and their Congressional allies would seek to curtail any Section 5 expansions. The FTC is a creation of Congress and so must answer to Congress.

The Prioritization of Criminal Prosecutions The designation of certain law enforcement efforts as priorities does make a difference in terms of what matters are declined.36 Congress, for example, has the ability to dictate priorities-at least to a certain extent-by increasing the number of DEA or INS agents or by increasing the funds available for securities fraud enforcement. Merely by bringing public attention to a law enforcement matter, Congress or the President may affect law enforcement efforts. Similarly, through the use of its oversight authority, Congress can press the DOJ to focus law enforcement efforts on particular areas of concern. As a result, the DOJ, as well as the local U.S. Attorneys' Offices, are able to designate certain matters as national and/or district priorities. Below, Table 5 contains data on the proportion of matters declined depending upon their priority classification as supplied in the original data set. As might be expected, the general finding is that matters designated as national priorities are less likely to be declined. Furthermore, as the data show, if a referred matter is both a national and a district priority, there is a low probability that it will be declined. If the referred matter is neither a national nor a district priority, however, there is a greater probability that it will be declined. Interestingly, the bulk of matters referred for prosecution constitute neither district nor national priorities. Because it appears that the vast majority of criminal matters investigated simply do not fall within the national or district priority categories, it would be useful to know whether the investigative agencies themselves are aware of the priorities that have been established at the DOJ. If emphasis is to be placed on certain sorts of crime control (e.g. fighting terrorism, combating the distribution of illegal weapons, etc.), it is important that the investigative agencies be on board as well. Criminal cases necessarily start out as investigations, and if the DOJ hopes to prioritize certain types of criminal enforcement, it must start on the front lines, with those who investigate criminal matters in the field.", ""], "id": "bf3a1fee382c18b038d9642e3bdd1aef65f4a56702282e2dabce7bb6ea552eef", "highlighted_text": " designation of law enforcement priorities does make a difference Congress affect law enforcement efforts through use of its oversight Congress press DOJ to focus efforts on particular areas matters designated as national priorities are less likely to be declined", "highlights": [[2, 51, 65], [2, 74, 89], [2, 101, 111], [2, 112, 116], [2, 117, 134], [2, 448, 456], [2, 478, 508], [2, 521, 528], [2, 533, 543], [2, 544, 553], [2, 565, 573], [2, 578, 583], [2, 588, 591], [2, 592, 594], [2, 595, 600], [2, 617, 627], [2, 628, 644], [2, 1003, 1048], [2, 1049, 1060], [2, 1061, 1066], [2, 1067, 1075]], "underlines": [[2, 7, 46], [2, 51, 65], [2, 65, 65], [2, 66, 73], [2, 74, 89], [2, 90, 97], [2, 98, 100], [2, 101, 111], [2, 112, 116], [2, 117, 134], [2, 135, 146], [2, 226, 236], [2, 312, 314], [2, 333, 338], [2, 383, 389], [2, 390, 392], [2, 393, 418], [2, 419, 421], [2, 422, 446], [2, 446, 447], [2, 448, 456], [2, 474, 477], [2, 478, 508], [2, 521, 528], [2, 529, 532], [2, 533, 543], [2, 544, 553], [2, 554, 558], [2, 558, 564], [2, 565, 573], [2, 574, 577], [2, 578, 583], [2, 584, 587], [2, 588, 591], [2, 592, 594], [2, 595, 600], [2, 601, 616], [2, 616, 616], [2, 617, 627], [2, 628, 644], [2, 645, 655], [2, 655, 801], [2, 1003, 1048], [2, 1049, 1060], [2, 1061, 1066], [2, 1067, 1075], [2, 1622, 1656], [2, 1661, 1815], [2, 1904, 1972]], "emphasis": [[2, 66, 73], [2, 74, 89], [2, 90, 97], [2, 101, 111], [2, 117, 134], [2, 393, 418], [2, 422, 446], [2, 478, 508], [2, 544, 553], [2, 554, 558], [2, 578, 583], [2, 584, 587], [2, 588, 591], [2, 595, 600], [2, 601, 616], [2, 628, 644], [2, 645, 655], [2, 1049, 1060], [2, 1067, 1075]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 9]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2004-01-01"}, {"tag": "Data from a wide range of industries proves this.", "cite": "Dafny 6-10 (Leemore Dafny \u2013 Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School and the John F.

DOI: 10.1177/0003603X20912884) ", "body": ["Judicial Resistance to Extensions of Existing Antitrust Doctrine As noted in Section II.A, judicial decisions since the mid-1970s have reshaped antitrust law; created more permissive substantive standards governing dominant firm conduct, mergers, and vertical restraints; and raised the bar to antitrust claims in a number of ways. This remolding has been facilitated by the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Sherman Act constitutes \u201ca special kind of common law offense,\u201d81 so that Congress \u201cexpected the courts to give shape to the statute\u2019s broad mandate by drawing on common-law tradition.\u201d82 This has allowed the statutory commands to be interpreted flexibly and the law to evolve with new circumstances and new wisdom;83 for example, where there is widespread agreement that the previous position is inappropriate or where the theoretical underpinnings of those decisions have been called into question.84 The proposed solutions will depend, in the short term at least, on the ability of enforcement agencies to navigate the described jurisprudence to find an antitrust infringement and, in some instances, a further rethinking, refinement, and/or development of doctrine, through softening, modification, or even a reversal of current case law. Although such an evolution could, in theory, result, as it did over the last forty years, from a steady stream of antitrust cases, judicial appointments since 2017 have arguably made such a change in direction unlikely. Rather, it seems more probable that successful prosecution of major antitrust, and especially Section 2 Sherman Act monopolization cases, will remain challenging and may even become more difficult. Cases will be litigated before judges who are ordinarily predisposed to accept the current framework, either by personal preference or by a felt compulsion to abide by forty years of jurisprudence that tells them to do so.85 A new president could gradually change the philosophy of the federal courts by appointing judges sympathetic to the aims of the proposed transformation.86 The reorientation of the courts through judicial appointments is, however, likely to take a long time.87 Until then, trial judges and the Court of Appeals will be compelled to abide by the existing jurisprudence and will only be at liberty to develop a more flexible approach in the \u201cgaps\u201d or spaces left by Supreme Court opinions\u2014for example, in relation to mergers and rebates\u2014and through creative interpretations of the law. Such cases are, however, likely to be hard fought. Indeed, Judge Lucy Koh\u2019s finding in Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm, Inc. 88 that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices constituted unlawful monopolization of the market for certain telecommunications chips has provoked hostile attacks, not only from practitioners and academics but also from the DOJ, the U.S. Departments of Defense and Energy, and even one of the FTC\u2019s own members. In a scathing op-ed in the Wall Street Journal,89 Commissioner Christine Wilson attacked Judge Koh\u2019s \u201cstartling new creation\u201d of legal obligations that may trigger a new wave of enforcement actions and undermine intellectual property rights. Commissioner Wilson condemned the judge\u2019s \u201cjudicial innovations,\u201d and \u201calchemy,\u201d through reviving and expanding the Supreme Court\u2019s 1985 opinion in Aspen Skiing Co v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp 90 (which she stresses was described by the Supreme Court in Trinko 91 as \u201cat or near the outer boundary\u201d of U.S. antitrust law), turning contractual obligations into antitrust claims, and for departing from current federal agency practice, by imposing remedies requiring Qualcomm to negotiate or renegotiate contracts with customers and competitors worldwide. She has thus urged the Ninth Circuit (on appeal), and if necessary the Supreme Court, to assess the wisdom of these sweeping changes and to stay the ruling.92 It seems likely therefore that, at the same time as bringing cases seeking to develop procedural, evidential, and substantive antitrust standards under the existing regime, additional antidotes to the stringencies of existing jurisprudence will be required, including more extensive, and expansive, use of Section 5 FTC Act to plug the gaps created by the narrowing of the scope of Section 2 Sherman Act; and/or the adoption of legislation that directs courts to apply a wider goals framework. B. Infirmities of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act One possible solution to rigidities that have developed in Sherman Act jurisprudence is for the FTC to rely more heavily on the prosecution, through its own administrative process, of cases based on Section 5 of the FTC Act and its prohibition of \u201cunfair methods of competition.\u201d93 This section allows the FTC94 to tackle not only anticompetitive practices prohibited by the other antitrust statutes but also conduct constituting incipient violations of those statutes or behavior that exceeds their reach. The latter is possible where the conduct does not infringe the letter of the antitrust laws but contradicts their basic spirit or public policy.95 There is no doubt therefore that Section 5 was designed as an expansion joint in the U.S. antitrust system. It seems unlikely to us, nonetheless, that a majority of FTC\u2019s current members will be minded to use it in this way. Further, even if they were to be, the reality is that such an application may encounter difficulties. Since its creation in 1914, the FTC has never prevailed before the Supreme Court in any case challenging dominant firm misconduct, whether premised on Section 2 of the Sherman Act or purely on Section 5 of the FTC Act.96 The last FTC success in federal court in a case predicated solely on Section 5 occurred in the late 1960s.97 The FTC\u2019s record of limited success with Section 5 has not been for want of trying. In the 1970s, the FTC undertook an ambitious program to make the enforcement of claims predicated on the distinctive reach of Section 5, a foundation to develop \u201ccompetition policy in its broadest sense.\u201d98 The agency\u2019s Section 5 agenda yielded some successes,99 but also a large number of litigation failures involving cases to address subtle forms of coordination in oligopolies, to impose new obligations on dominant firms, and to dissolve shared monopolies.100 The agency\u2019s program elicited powerful legislative backlash from a Congress that once supported FTC\u2019s trailblazing initiatives but turned against it as the Commission\u2019s efforts to obtain dramatic structural remedies unfolded.101 C. Designing Effective Remedies Important issues arising for the new enforcement strategy proposed will be what remedies should be sought; how can an order, or decree, be fashioned to ensure that the violation is terminated, that competition on the market is restored, the opportunity for competition is re-established, and that future violations are not committed and deterred; and will a court be likely to impose any such remedy.102 The Sherman Act treats infringements of its key commands as crimes attracting severe sanctions, including fines (corporate and individual) and imprisonment. Although since 1980, the DOJ has used criminal prosecutions only to challenge hard-core horizontal cartels,103 some antitrust reform proponents are calling for the introduction of fines to sanction illegal monopolization, and some commentators have proposed that the DOJ reconsider its policy of not seeking criminal penalties beyond the Section 1 conspiracy context.104 For the time being, however, it would appear that existing civil sanctions will remain the tool of choice for DOJ in dealing with antitrust infringements and will be the only set of remedies available to the FTC, which has no mandate to bring criminal cases. The civil remedial options, which can broadly be grouped into three categories, for the federal agencies, are nonetheless powerful in principle. The first and, perhaps, the most common form of remedy consists of controls on conduct. Conduct-related relief ordinarily takes the form of cease and desist orders that forbid certain behavior or, in a smaller number of cases, compel firms to engage in affirmative acts, such as providing a competitor access to an asset needed to compete. The second major form of remedy is structural relief in the form of divestitures or the compulsory licensing of intellectual property that enables a firm to enter a previously monopolized market. The boundary between purely conduct-based and structural remedies is not always clear. A compulsory licensing decree has strong structural features (it directly facilitates new entry) and conduct elements (it may require the owner of the patent to provide the licensee know-how and updates of the patented technology). The third remedy consists of civil monetary relief in the form of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains or the restitution of monopoly overcharges to victims. A number of Supreme Court decisions in monopolization cases in the late 1940s and early 1950s appeared to hold that these forms of recovery are encompassed in the mandate of courts to order equitable remedies to cure antitrust violations. The federal agencies have not used this power expansively, though it would appear to be available to recoup overcharges in Section 2 or other cases.105 The cures envisaged by many of the advocates of change call for the bold application of the full portfolio of civil remedies, including unwinding past mergers, divestment of assets, restructuring concentrated markets, limiting or reversing vertical integration or through the imposition of licensing obligations. Such advocates thus wish the DOJ and FTC to use the antitrust laws as an effective and simple mechanism for deconcentrating both monopolistic and oligopolistic markets, rapidly introducing new competition into a market; and reversing what they consider to be severe structural problems that have been allowed to develop on the market.106 Structural remedies, in particular, have always been a real and important part of the antitrust remedial arsenal,107 not only in merger cases where a violation of the antitrust rules may consist of an unlawful acquisition of shares or stock108 but also in Sherman Act cases.109 In the 1960s the FTC also sought, using its powers under Section 5 FTC Act to deconcentrate the petrol and breakfast cereal markets110 and in 1969 the Neal Report,111 commissioned by President Lyndon Johnson, proposed the adoption of laws which would allow oligopolistic industries to be deconcentrated and the condemnation of mergers on markets that were already concentrated.112 Modern antitrust has, however, had less appetite for the use of antitrust to break up companies. Although the District Court in United States v Microsoft Corp113 ordered, at the request of the DOJ, that Microsoft be broken into two parts, the Court of Appeals, despite affirming the violation of section 2, reversed and remanded the finding that Microsoft should be split into two. Setting out a high bar for structural relief, the Court stressed that the lower court had not (1) held a remedies-specific hearing114 or (2) provided adequate reasons for the decreed remedies.115 A number of factors seem responsible for the trend away from structural remedies. First, the change in antitrust thinking that has evolved since the early 1970s, from a belief that antitrust intervention and structural remedies can improve performance116 to the current more laissez-faire one.117 Second, concerns about the effectiveness of previous attempts to deconcentrate industries,118 especially given the length of time that antitrust proceedings take.119 Third, the difficulty involved in constructing and overseeing a structural remedy effectively. Although in cases involving a merger or acquisition it may be relatively easy to structure such a remedy through disentangling assets that were once owned separately,120 outside of this situation, the question of how and what to divest might be much more speculative, seem much more risky and may in fact be complex and difficult to administer (involving significant restructuring, separation of physical facilities, and allocation of staff from integrated teams).121 These types of concern make it a challenge to persuade a court that a structural remedy is warranted and will be successful in achieving its objective.122 In the discussion above, we have been addressing the types of remedies that are imposed at the conclusion of a lawsuit. A problem in highly dynamic markets, however, is that the lag between the initiation of a case and a final order on relief may be so great that market circumstances have changed dramatically or the victim of allegedly improper exclusion may have left the market or otherwise lost its opportunity to expand and contest the position of the incumbent dominant firm. In this context, the antitrust cure arrives far too late to protect competition. The relatively slow pace of antitrust investigations and litigation (with appeals that follow an initial decision) has led some observers to doubt the efficacy of antitrust cases as effective policy-making tools in dynamic commercial sectors. There are at least five possible responses to concerns about the speed of antitrust litigation, particularly matters involving dominant firms. First, agencies could experiment with ways to accelerate investigations, and courts could adopt innovative techniques to shorten the length of trials. In the United States, we perceive that greater integration of effort among the public agencies would permit the more rapid completion of investigations (e.g., by pooling knowledge and focusing more resources on the collection and evaluation of evidence). Courts could use methods tested with success in the DOJ prosecution of Microsoft in the late 1990s to truncate the presentation of evidence. These types of measures have some promise to bring matters to a close more quickly. Second, the initiation of a lawsuit could be recognized as being, in some important ways, its own remedy; the prosecution of a case by itself causes the firm to change its behavior in ways that give rivals more breathing room to grow. Moreover, the visible presence of the enforcement authority, manifest by its investigations and lawsuits, causes other firms to reconsider tactics that arguably violate the law. Seen in this light, the entry of a final order that specifies remedies may not be necessary for all instances to have the desired chastening effect. A third response is to experiment more broadly with interim relief that seeks to suspend certain types of exclusionary conduct pending the completion of the full trial.123 Effective interim measures would require the enforcement agency to develop a base of knowledge about the sector that enables it to accurately identify the practices to be enjoined on an interim basis and to give judges a confident basis for intervening in this manner. A fourth approach would be that the remedies achieved in protracted antitrust litigation may not be so imperfect or untimely as they might appear to be. There have been a number of instances in which the remedy achieved in a monopolization case was rebuked as desperately insufficient when ordered but turned out to have positive competitive consequences.124 This is a humbling and difficult aspect of policy making. It may not be easy for an agency to persuade its political overseers\u2014or other external audiences\u2014that the chief benefits of its intervention will emerge in, say, two or three decades. Yet the positive results may take a long time to become apparent. A fifth technique would be to rely more heavily on ex-ante regulation in the form of trade regulation rules that forbid certain practices. A competition authority\u2014most likely the FTC\u2014would use its rulemaking powers to proscribe specific types of conduct (e.g., self-preferencing by dominant information services platforms). In this article, we do not purport to solve the problems of the remedial design set out above. There is, however, a fairly clear conclusion about how enforcement agencies should go about thinking of remedies. As we note below, there is considerable room for public agencies to design remedies more effectively by systematically examining past experience and collaborating with external researchers to identify superior techniques. In this regard, the FTC\u2019s collection of policy tools would appear to make it the ideal focal point for the development of more effective approaches to remedial design. D. Political Backlash As we have already indicated, the government\u2019s prosecution of high stakes antitrust cases often inspires defendants to lobby elected officials to rein in the enforcement agency. Targets of cases that seek to impose powerful remedies have several possible paths to encourage politicians to blunt enforcement measures. One path is to seek intervention from the President. The Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division serves at the will of the President, making DOJ policy dependent on the President\u2019s continuing support. The White House ordinarily does not guide the Antitrust Division\u2019s selection of cases, but there have been instances in which the President pressured the Division to alter course on behalf of a defendant, and did so successfully.125 The second path is to lobby the Congress. The FTC is called an \u201cindependent\u201d regulatory agency, but Congress interprets independence in an idiosyncratic way.126 Legislators believe independence means insulation from the executive branch, not from the legislature. The FTC is dependent on a good relationship with Congress, which controls its budget and can react with hostility, and forcefully, when it disapproves of FTC litigation\u2014particularly where it adversely affects the interests of members\u2019 constituents. Controversial and contested cases may consequently be derailed or muted if political support for them wanes and politicians become more sympathetic to commercial interests. The FTC\u2019s sometimes tempestuous relationship with Congress demonstrates that political coalitions favoring bold enforcement can be volatile, unpredictable, and evanescent.127 If the FTC does not manage its relationship with Congress carefully, its litigation opponents may mobilize legislative intervention that causes ambitious enforcement measures to the founder. Imagine, for a moment, that the DOJ and the FTC launch monopolization cases against each of the GAFA giants. Among other grounds, these cases might be premised on the theory that the firms used mergers to accumulate and protect positions of dominance. The GAFA firms have received unfavorable scrutiny from legislators from both political parties over the past few years, but the current wave of political opprobrium is unlikely to discourage the firms from bringing their formidable lobbying resources to bear upon the Congress. It would be hazardous for the enforcement agencies to assume that a sustained, well-financed lobbying campaign will be ineffective. At a minimum, the agencies would need to consider how many battles they can fight at one time, and how to foster a countervailing coalition of business interests to oppose the defendants. E. Opposition to Legislative Reform Although statutory reform might at first sight appear to be a direct, effective solution to some of the impediments (such as entrenched judicial resistance to intervention), there are good reasons to expect that powerful business interests will also stoutly oppose any proposals for legislation to expand the reach of the antitrust laws or to create a new digital regulator.128 One can envisage the formidable financial and political resources of the affected firms will amass to stymie far-reaching legislative reforms. Legislative steps that threaten the structure, operations, and profitability of the Tech Giants and other leading firms are fraught with political risk. These risks are surmountable, but only by means of a clever strategy that anticipates and blunts political pressure. One element of such a strategy is to mobilize countervailing support from consumer and business interests to sustain an enabling political environment to enact ambitious new laws. Even if successful, \u201c[l]egislative relief from existing jurisprudential structures might take years to accomplish\u201d;129 acts taken under new legislation\u2014even with the establishment of presumptions that improve the litigation position of government plaintiffs\u2014may still be relatively complex and difficult to prosecute. Rulemaking is an alternative to litigation, but it is no easy way out of the problem.

The U.S. and Russia, both of which maintain massive nuclear arsenals, are increasingly at odds. Iran has announced plans to ramp up its production of enriched uranium. North Korea may already have nuclear missiles capable of striking anywhere in the U.S., and there is no way to know whether Trump\u2019s negotiations with Kim Jong-un will wind up increasing or decreasing the prospect of nuclear war. But the current state of dread, while entirely understandable, has overshadowed two crucial realities about the threat of a nuclear calamity. First, a nuclear attack on the United States could well come not from the skies but from the streets. Experts warn that it would be relatively easy for terrorists to build an \u201cimprovised nuclear bomb\u201d and smuggle it into America. Building a ten-kiloton bomb nearly as destructive as the one dropped on Hiroshima would require little more than some technical expertise and 46 kilograms of highly enriched uranium \u2014 a quantity about the size of a bowling ball.", "The second reality we have failed to understand is what a nuclear detonation and its aftermath would actually look like. In our imaginations, fueled by apocalyptic fictions like The Road and The Day After, the scale and speed of nuclear annihilation seem too vast and horrific to contemplate. If nuclear war is considered \u201cunthinkable,\u201d that is in no small part because of our refusal to think about it with any clarity or specificity. In the long run, the best deterrent to nuclear war may be to understand what a single nuclear bomb is capable of doing to, say, a city like New York \u2014 and to accept that the reality would be even worse than our fears.", "The Bomb", "There are currently at least 2,000 tons of weapons-grade nuclear material stored in some 40 countries \u2014 enough to make more than 40,000 bombs approximately the size of the one that devastated Hiroshima. Stealing the material would be challenging but far from impossible. Russia stockpiles numerous bombs built before the use of electronic locks that disable the weapons in the event of tampering. Universities that handle uranium often have lax security. And insiders at military compounds sometimes steal radioactive material and sell it on the black market. Since 1993, there have been 762 known instances in which radioactive materials were lost or stolen, and more than 2,000 cases of trafficking and other criminal activities.", "Once terrorists obtained the uranium, they would need only a small team of sympathetic engineers and physicists to build what is known as a gun-type nuclear bomb, like the one dropped on Hiroshima. A gun-type nuke uses traditional explosives to fire a slug of uranium through a tube directly into another chunk of uranium, fracturing huge numbers of atoms and unleashing a massive amount of energy.

A ten-kiloton bomb, which would release as much energy as 10,000 tons of TNT, would be only seven feet long and weigh about 1,000 pounds. It would be simple to transport such a device to America aboard a container ship, just another unseen object in a giant metal box among millions of other metal boxes floating on the ocean. Even a moderate amount of shielding would be enough to hide its radioactive signature from most detectors at shipping hubs. Given all the naturally radioactive items that frequently trigger false alarms \u2014 bananas, ceramics, Brazil nuts, pet deodorizers \u2014 a terrorist group could even bury the bomb in bags of Fresh Step or Tidy Cats to fool inspectors if a security sensor was tripped. In 1946, a senator asked J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who played a key role in the Manhattan Project, what instrument he would use to detect a nuclear bomb smuggled into the United States. Oppenheimer\u2019s answer: \u201cA screwdriver.\u201d Amazingly, our detection systems have still not caught up to this threat: One would essentially have to open and visually inspect every single crate and container arriving on America\u2019s shores. Once the container ship reached a port like Newark, terrorists would have no trouble loading the concealed bomb into the back of an unassuming white van and driving it through the Lincoln Tunnel directly into Times Square.", ""], "id": "6b242acea9bbac027f7a1a64ebc109bf827728f2b193c5a84d1a56185ba2eedb", "highlighted_text": " it would be easy to build nuclear bomb and smuggle it 2,000 tons of weapons-grade nuclear material in 40 countries stockpiles built before electronic locks Universities lax security insiders steal and sell 2,000 cases of trafficking bomb would be seven feet long simple to transport aboard ship unseen in metal box", "highlights": [[2, 777, 788], [2, 800, 804], [2, 820, 828], [2, 844, 856], [2, 858, 861], [2, 862, 872], [5, 29, 39], [5, 40, 73], [5, 81, 83], [5, 89, 101], [5, 278, 288], [5, 304, 309], [5, 310, 316], [5, 328, 344], [5, 397, 409], [5, 441, 453], [5, 459, 467], [5, 500, 505], [5, 527, 530], [5, 531, 535], [5, 674, 700], [7, 113, 117], [7, 177, 185], [7, 191, 206], [7, 249, 268], [7, 294, 300], [7, 313, 317], [7, 332, 338], [7, 346, 348], [7, 357, 366]], "underlines": [[2, 759, 776], [2, 777, 788], [2, 788, 788], [2, 789, 799], [2, 800, 804], [2, 805, 819], [2, 820, 828], [2, 829, 843], [2, 844, 856], [2, 856, 857], [2, 858, 861], [2, 862, 872], [2, 873, 885], [2, 885, 914], [2, 922, 939], [2, 959, 968], [2, 975, 999], [2, 1000, 1004], [2, 1005, 1028], [2, 1029, 1041], [2, 1042, 1068], [2, 1071, 1091], [2, 1092, 1114], [2, 1114, 1115], [5, 0, 9], [5, 29, 39], [5, 40, 73], [5, 81, 83], [5, 89, 101], [5, 104, 128], [5, 129, 141], [5, 203, 211], [5, 212, 224], [5, 224, 224], [5, 225, 233], [5, 250, 269], [5, 269, 270], [5, 271, 277], [5, 278, 288], [5, 289, 303], [5, 304, 309], [5, 310, 316], [5, 317, 327], [5, 328, 344], [5, 397, 409], [5, 410, 440], [5, 441, 453], [5, 453, 454], [5, 459, 467], [5, 468, 489], [5, 500, 505], [5, 506, 526], [5, 527, 530], [5, 531, 535], [5, 536, 558], [5, 558, 571], [5, 572, 587], [5, 587, 587], [5, 588, 591], [5, 592, 597], [5, 598, 607], [5, 608, 643], [5, 644, 648], [5, 649, 651], [5, 652, 658], [5, 658, 673], [5, 674, 700], [7, 31, 62], [7, 68, 69], [7, 77, 85], [7, 86, 97], [7, 97, 112], [7, 113, 117], [7, 177, 185], [7, 186, 190], [7, 191, 206], [7, 207, 222], [7, 223, 235], [7, 235, 248], [7, 249, 268], [7, 269, 293], [7, 294, 300], [7, 301, 312], [7, 313, 317], [7, 319, 331], [7, 332, 338], [7, 339, 345], [7, 345, 345], [7, 346, 348], [7, 349, 350], [7, 351, 356], [7, 357, 366], [7, 367, 402], [7, 1293, 1372], [7, 1373, 1393]], "emphasis": [[2, 789, 799], [2, 800, 804], [2, 844, 856], [2, 862, 872], [2, 959, 968], [2, 1000, 1004], [2, 1029, 1041], [2, 1092, 1114], [5, 29, 39], [5, 89, 101], [5, 129, 141], [5, 203, 211], [5, 212, 224], [5, 250, 269], [5, 310, 316], [5, 317, 327], [5, 328, 344], [5, 397, 409], [5, 441, 453], [5, 459, 467], [5, 500, 505], [5, 531, 535], [5, 536, 558], [5, 588, 591], [5, 592, 597], [5, 598, 607], [5, 644, 648], [5, 652, 658], [5, 674, 700], [7, 86, 97], [7, 191, 206], [7, 223, 235], [7, 294, 300], [7, 301, 312], [7, 313, 317], [7, 332, 338], [7, 339, 345], [7, 351, 356], [7, 357, 366], [7, 1373, 1393]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 7]], "filename": "neg-2.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2018-06-01"}, {"tag": "The fifty states and relevant subnational entities, through the Multistate Antitrust Task Force, should issue a rule subject to notice and comment that adopts a symmetric competition standard for anticompetitive business practices.", "cite": "Arteaga & Ludwig \u201921 [Juan; 1/28/21; Partner @ Crowell & Moring LLP, JD @ Columbia; and Jordan; Partner @ Crowell & Moring LLP, JD @ Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; \u201cThe Role of US State Antitrust Enforcement,\u201d Global Competition Review; https://globalcompetitionreview.com/guide/private-litigation-guide/second-edition/article/the-role-of-us-state-antitrust-enforcement; AS]  ", "body": ["During the 1980s, for example, state attorneys general once again emerged as vigorous antitrust enforcers, especially with respect to the prosecution of resale price maintenance practices and other vertical restraints.

To help ensure that they had a larger seat at the antitrust enforcement table, state attorneys general also increased the coordination of their enforcement efforts and competition advocacy through organisations such as the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), which created a Multistate Antitrust Task Force and issued state Vertical Restraints and Horizontal Merger Guidelines during this period.\u00a0", "Since the reawakening of state antitrust enforcement nearly 30 years ago, state attorneys general have continued to play an important role in the enforcement of both state and federal antitrust laws. During periods of lax federal antitrust enforcement, state attorneys general have often ramped up their enforcement activity in order to protect consumers from anticompetitive transactions and business practices. During periods of vigorous federal antitrust enforcement, they have often served as strong partners for the DOJ and FTC by, among other things, offering valuable insights about competitive dynamics in local markets, assisting with obtaining information from key market participants (including state governmental entities that are direct purchasers of goods and services), and helping develop and implement litigation strategies for cases being tried before federal judges presiding in their states.\u00a0", "Since\u00a0January 2017,\u00a0state attorneys general have increasingly played a leading and independent antitrust enforcement role. State antitrust enforcers have significantly increased their enforcement activity and willingness to act separately from their federal counterparts because many of them believe that there has been \u2018under-enforcement\u2019 by the DOJ and FTC. State antitrust enforcers have also been able to enhance their influence over key competition policy issues and the antitrust enforcement agenda within the United States because there appears to have been a significant decline in the coordination and relationship between the DOJ and FTC.\u00a0"], "id": "c0e8a9fa48794e2bed3ba065ef4e9eef667950cd3d1aabca62be3ebf258a2a41", "highlighted_text": " state

From the outset, these agencies were not uniformly consumer-welfare impelled or oriented, nor have they altogether evolved in that direction. Their focus has been as much on social and political, non-consumer-welfare concerns-a continuing condition more prevalent before the mid-1970s than today. Federal economic concerns with market power brought about the establishment of regulatory agencies prior to enactment of the Sherman Act.' The patriarch, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887,2 was a congressional response to concerns with the alleged monopoly and political power of the nation's railroads. Over the ensuing years, numerous other non-antitrust agencies were vested with power to regulate competition. Evolving from concerns with \"bigness\" as a threat to markets and, indeed, to the political system, legislation was enacted to address particular industries. This legislation afforded specialized agencies authority to regulate competition, to some extent in the same vein as that vested in the traditional antitrust agenciese.g., the Packers and Stockyards Act of 19213 and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.' Specialized agencies were also created to deal with the competitive functioning of industries in markets which were believed to embrace public assets, for example, air space and airlines and, initially, spectrum and broadcast communications. Part of the concern with \"bigness\" derived from fear of \"excessive\" competition, leading to statutory and regulatory restrictions on low-level pricing and limitations on market entry. The antitrust statutes were not immune from infection by this concern, as evidenced by enactment of the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936.' While the jurisdiction of sectoral agencies over competition and the relevant industries was often expressed in the governing statues as antitrust concerns, the overarching mandate was, and is, to protect and advance \"the public interest.\" This ambiguous standard continues to provide sectoral agencies with more latitude to address industry competitive and other attributes beyond consumer welfare. The unfortunate ambiguity of this standard is brilliantly illuminated in an address by Judge Henry Friendly in the 1962 Oliver Wendell Holmes lectures at Harvard Law School and in a subsequent article in the Harvard Law Review."], "id": "98f9b562148317bf4e5dd72fa9b81d18b6ea375dcb949d00a1dc3fe8c31a7b58", "highlighted_text": " Multiple federal enforcement agencies with competition authority Their focus has been on social and political, concerns Interstate Commerce congressional response to monopoly and political power non-antitrust agencies vested with power to regulate competition Packers and Stockyards Act Public Utility Holding Act Specialized agencies deal with the competitive functioning of industries embrace public assets, ambiguous standard provide sectoral agencies with latitude to address industry competitive attributes beyond consumer welfare", "highlights": [[2, 0, 37], [2, 38, 42], [2, 43, 54], [2, 63, 72], [2, 276, 296], [2, 305, 307], [2, 308, 329], [2, 351, 359], [2, 589, 608], [2, 629, 651], [2, 652, 654], [2, 681, 709], [2, 776, 798], [2, 804, 845], [2, 1180, 1206], [2, 1224, 1246], [2, 1255, 1258], [2, 1269, 1289], [2, 1311, 1362], [2, 1397, 1419], [2, 2074, 2092], [2, 2106, 2136], [2, 2142, 2182], [2, 2193, 2227]], "underlines": [[2, 0, 37], [2, 37, 37], [2, 38, 42], [2, 42, 42], [2, 43, 54], [2, 54, 62], [2, 63, 72], [2, 276, 296], [2, 297, 304], [2, 305, 307], [2, 307, 307], [2, 308, 329], [2, 330, 350], [2, 351, 359], [2, 359, 429], [2, 570, 588], [2, 589, 608], [2, 609, 628], [2, 629, 651], [2, 651, 651], [2, 652, 654], [2, 655, 680], [2, 681, 709], [2, 710, 736], [2, 761, 775], [2, 776, 798], [2, 799, 803], [2, 804, 845], [2, 946, 980], [2, 981, 1002], [2, 1173, 1179], [2, 1180, 1206], [2, 1207, 1223], [2, 1224, 1246], [2, 1247, 1254], [2, 1255, 1258], [2, 1259, 1266], [2, 1269, 1289], [2, 1290, 1310], [2, 1311, 1362], [2, 1363, 1396], [2, 1397, 1419], [2, 1420, 1509], [2, 2069, 2073], [2, 2074, 2092], [2, 2093, 2105], [2, 2106, 2136], [2, 2137, 2141], [2, 2142, 2182], [2, 2183, 2192], [2, 2193, 2227], [2, 2227, 2228]], "emphasis": [[2, 0, 37], [2, 37, 37], [2, 38, 42], [2, 42, 42], [2, 43, 54], [2, 54, 62], [2, 63, 72], [2, 276, 296], [2, 589, 608], [2, 652, 654], [2, 761, 775], [2, 776, 798], [2, 799, 803], [2, 804, 845], [2, 1180, 1206], [2, 1255, 1258], [2, 2069, 2073], [2, 2074, 2092], [2, 2093, 2105], [2, 2106, 2136], [2, 2137, 2141], [2, 2142, 2182], [2, 2183, 2192], [2, 2193, 2227], [2, 2227, 2228]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 6]], "filename": "neg-6.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2002-01-01"}, {"tag": "Plan trades off with FTC resources in other areas", "cite": "Reinhart 21 \u2013 Tara Reinhart, head of the Antitrust/Competition Group in Skadden\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, \u201cLina Khan\u2019s Appointment as FTC Chair Reflects Biden Administration\u2019s Aggressive Stance on Antitrust Enforcement,\u201d 6/18/21, https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/06/lina-khans-appointment-as-ftc-chair", "body": ["Second, like all antitrust enforcers, Ms. Khan and the FTC will face resource constraints.

It is a key component for human flourishing.", "THE FTC HAS ACHIEVED MUCH WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND WITHOUT CONSISTENT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT", "Many privacy issues are thought to be new. But the FTC has decades of experience handling privacy problems, particularly in credit reporting and debt collection. The FTC\u2019s earliest information privacy matters, in 1951 and then a series of cases in the 1970s, recognized the general consumer preference against commercialization of personal data. Using its enforcement powers, the FTC sued companies for deceptive data collection, and for the sale of data collected in preparing tax returns. The agency brought its first internet-related fraud case in 1994, long before most consumers shopped online. Since then, the FTC has pursued the biggest names in internet commerce. It has steadily broadened the duties for fair information handling, particularly in the information security domain.", "The FTC\u2019s broadest jurisdiction is its enforcement against unfair and deceptive practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Despite a wide reach, however, Section 5 has some significant limits in power. The FTC generally cannot issue a fine for Section 5 violations initially\u2014fines can only be issued for violations of consent decrees, as happened in the Facebook case.", "Resources are the FTC\u2019s greatest constraint. It is a small agency charged with a broad mission in competition and consumer protection. It carries out this mission with a budget of just over $300 million and a total staff of about 1,100, of whom no more than 50 are tasked with privacy. In comparison, the U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) has over 700 employees and a \u00a338 million budget for a mission focused entirely on privacy and data protection. In addition, for much of modern history, Congress has kept the FTC on a short leash. In 1980, Congress\u00a0punished the agency for being too aggressive, causing it to shut down twice. Congress has held authorization over the agency\u2019s head and used oversight power to scrutinize what members of Congress perceive as the expansive use of FTC legal authority, including its interpretation of privacy harm.", "Given these constraints, FTC attorneys make pragmatic choices in their case selection. At any given time, line attorneys are investigating many companies and weighing decisions on where to target limited enforcement resources. The FTC can only bring actions against a small fraction of infringers, and it has chosen cases wisely to make loud statements to industry about how to protect privacy.", "Even with these severe limitations, it has managed to bolster important norms and send strong signals to industry that have influenced the practices of many companies. It has become a significant enforcement agency that industry pays attention to. It has an enforcement record that compares quite well to other agencies in the US as well as around the world.", "Some critics of the Facebook settlement have focused only on its shortcomings. Despite flaws and limits in the consent order, the five-billion-dollar fine was the biggest privacy settlement worldwide by far. It is an order of magnitude greater than the highest fine under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation so far (the UK ICO\u2019s \u20ac183 million fine against British Airways) and roughly double the record fine under EU competition law, which privacy advocates have urged as the reference for privacy fines.", "The settlement also contains significant and noteworthy measures, such as forcing Facebook to make privacy a board-level concern and requiring Mark Zuckerberg to verify compliance. As dissenting Commissioners Chopra and Slaughter note, the FTC\u2019s settlement doesn\u2019t solve every problem; Facebook\u2019s structure and business model remain the same. But no existing enforcement agency has come close to matching the FTC\u2019s impact in this case, and foreign data protection agencies similar to proposed in the U.S. as FTC alternatives have not demonstrated the power or political capital to do so. As privacy enforcers go, the FTC stacks up well to others in many regards."], "id": "3c1ae17fbb6de3dfc8b0b67f4fd110396ed3037a5d1aaf233c39bc669b163d88", "highlighted_text": " FTC  is the right agency

Nor are they prepared to address the emerging fault lines in how to approach it. The institutional framework for international trade-that of the World Trade Organization and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-was built at a time when mainly agricultural and manufactured goods crossed borders and data flows were in the realm of fiction. The wTO's framework depends on two key classifications: whether something is a good or a service and where it originated. Goods are governed by different trade rules than are services, and a product's origin defines what duties or trade restrictions apply.", "Data defies this basic categorization for several reasons. One is that vast amounts of data-such as one's online browsing before ordering clothes-are unpriced consequences of the production and consumption of other goods and services. Another is that it is often hard to determine where data is created and kept. (From which country does data on an international flight's engineering performance originate? In which country does a multinational firm's cloud storage of its clients' data reside?) Moreover, there is no agreed-on taxonomy for valuing data. In the event of a trade dispute, WTO members may seek legal recourse and ask the organization to make a one-off correction, but such fixes do not address the fundamental inconsistencies between the WTO's framework and the nature of data.", "The lack of an internationally accepted framework governing data leaves big questions about the global economy and national security unanswered. Should sovereign governments be able to limit the location and use of their citizens' data within national borders? What does this concept even mean when the cloud and its data are distributed across the Internet? Should governments be able to tax the arrival of data from other nations, just as they levy tariffs on the import of many goods and services? How would this work when the data flows themselves are often unpriced, at least within the firms that gather the data? What controls can sovereign governments impose on data entering their countries? Can they demand that data be stored locally or that they be given access to it?", "The absence of an international framework also threatens people's privacy. Who will ensure that governments or other actors do not misuse people's data and violate their economic, political, and human rights? How can governments protect their citizens' privacy while allowing data to move across borders? Today, the United States and the EU do not agree on answers to these questions, causing friction that hurts cooperation on trade, investment, and national security. China, for its part, has shown little commitment to privacy. Without common and verifiable methods of anonymizing data to protect personal privacy, the innovative potential of personal data will be lost-or fundamental rights will be violated.", "In the absence of coherent and collective answers to these questions, countries and trade blocs are improvising on their own. This has left the world today with a collection of inconsistent, vague, and piecemeal regulations. Recent regional trade deals have included several provisions regarding data and e-commerce. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which does not include the United States, prohibits requirements that data be stored within a given country and bans duties on cross-border flows of electronic content. It recognizes the growing importance of the digital services sector, and it forbids signatories from demanding access to the source codes of companies' software. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has similar provisions. Both free-trade agreements aim to allow unencumbered flows of data, but they are largely untested and, by virtue of being regional, are limited.", "The EU sharpened its data rules on privacy in the General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR attempts to empower individuals to decide how companies can use their data, but many have voiced concerns that the GDPR has effectively established trade barriers for foreign firms operating in EU member countries by requiring expensive compliance measures and raising the European market's liability risks. Moreover, the EU's rules are the subject of continual dispute and litigation.", "Of much greater concern to the United States is China's distinct digital ecosystem. Over a generation ago, China began building its \"Great Firewall,\" a combination of laws and technologies that restrict the flow of data in and out of China, in part by blocking foreign websites. China has since adopted a techno-nationalist model that mandates government access to data generated in the country. The sheer quantity of that data fuels China's innovation but also enables the country's repressive system of control and surveillance-and at the expense of open, international flows of data.", "Beijing now seeks to expand this model. It has clear plans to use its indigenous technology industry to dominate the digital platforms that manage data, most immediately 5G telecommunications networks. To that end, it has unveiled an audacious plan, China Standards 2035, to set global standards in emerging technologies. And through the so-called Digital Silk Road and the broader Belt and Road Initiative, it is working to spread its model of data governance and expand its access to data by building Internet infrastructure abroad and boosting digital trade.", "And the United States? At the federal level, the country has not settled on any legal framework. Nor, beyond the USMCA, has it engaged in any meaningful cross-border agreements on data flows. So far, the United States has not answered China's efforts with a coherent plan to shape technology standards or ensure widespread privacy protections. The United States' ad hoc responses and targeted efforts to encourage other countries to reject the Chinese company Huawei's 5G technology may work in the near term. But they do not constitute an effective long-term plan for harnessing the power of data."], "id": "983ec801f1545a6bf0b3e8a4db2c24b8abb220bf827a36a7d6d28eb79a415ee5", "highlighted_text": " Current

Some analysts paint catastrophic pictures. Robert Kagan foresees a return to the despotism, protectionism, and strife of the 1930s, with China and Russia reprising the roles of imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. Peter Zeihan predicts a violent scramble for security and resources, in which Russia invades its neighbors and East Asia descends into naval warfare. These forecasts may be extreme, but they reflect an essential truth: the postwar order, although flawed and incomplete in many ways, has fostered the most peaceful and prosperous period in human history, and its absence would make the world a more dangerous place. ", "Thanks to the U.S.-led order, for decades, most countries have not had to fight for market access, guard their supply chains, or even seriously defend their borders. The U.S. Navy has kept international waterways open, the U.S. market has provided reliable consumer demand and capital for dozens of countries, and U.S. security guarantees have covered nearly 70 nations. Such assurances have benefited everyone: not just Washington\u2019s allies and partners but also its adversaries. U.S. security guarantees had the effect of neutering Germany and Japan, the main regional rivals of Russia and China, respectively. In turn, Moscow and Beijing could focus on forging ties with the rest of the world rather than fighting their historical enemies. Without U.S. patronage and protection, countries would have to get back in the business of securing themselves and their economic lifelines. ", "Such a world would see the return of great-power mercantilism and new forms of imperialism. Powerful countries would once again try to reduce their economic insecurity by establishing exclusive economic zones, where their firms could enjoy cheap and secure access to raw materials and large captive consumer markets. Today, China is already starting to do this with its Belt and Road Initiative, a network of infrastructure projects around the world; its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d policy, to stimulate domestic production and consumption; and its attempts to create a closed-off, parallel Internet. If the United States follows suit, other countries will have to attach themselves to an American or a Chinese bloc\u2014or forge blocs of their own. France might seek to restore its grip on its former African colonies. Russia might accelerate its efforts to corral former Soviet states into a regional trade union. Germany increasingly would have to look beyond Europe\u2019s shrinking populations to find buyers for its exports\u2014and it would have to develop the military capacity to secure those new far-flung markets and supply lines, too. ", "As great powers competed for economic spheres, global governance would erode. Geopolitical conflict would paralyze the UN, as was the case during the Cold War. NATO might dissolve as the United States cherry-picked partners. And the unraveling of the U.S. security blanket over Europe could mean the end of the European Union, too, which already suffers from deep divisions. The few arms control treaties that remain in force today might fall by the wayside as countries militarized to defend themselves. Efforts to combat transnational problems\u2014such as climate change, financial crises, or pandemics\u2014would mimic the world\u2019s shambolic response to COVID-19, when countries hoarded supplies, the World Health Organization parroted Chinese misinformation, and the United States withdrew into itself. ", "The resulting disorder would jeopardize the very survival of some states. Since 1945, the number of countries in the world has tripled, from 46 to nearly 200. Most of these new states, however, are weak and lack energy, resources, food, domestic markets, advanced technology, military power, or defensible borders. According to research by the political scientist Arjun Chowdhury, two-thirds of all countries today cannot provide basic services to their people without international help. In short, most countries depend critically on the postwar order, which has offered historically unprecedented access to international aid, markets, shipping, and protection. Without such support, some countries would collapse or be conquered. Fragile, aid-dependent states such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Liberia are only some of the most obvious high-risk cases. Less obvious ones are capable but trade-dependent countries such as Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea, whose economic systems would struggle to function in a world of closed markets and militarized sea-lanes.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59081791)", "US President Joe Biden unveiled a revamped $1.75tn (\u00a31.27tn) spending plan on Thursday, calling it a historic investment in the country's future. \"No one got everything they wanted, including me,\" he said, acknowledging the struggle within his party to reach consensus on a pair of landmark bills. Narrow margins in Congress require nearly unanimous support from the Democrats for the bills to pass. They include major investments in infrastructure, climate and childcare. Mr Biden's Democratic party suggested this week that an agreement was on the horizon, ahead of Mr Biden's trip to Europe later on Thursday. President Biden will travel to Rome, the Vatican and later to Glasgow, Scotland for the United Nations climate conference, COP26. But it remains to be seen whether Mr Biden has achieved the level of cooperation needed from within his party to move the spending plan forward. This new proposal is thought to be a stripped-down version of the roughly $3.5tn social spending plan favoured by progressives. Mr Biden was expected to use his Thursday morning meeting with House Democrats to convince progressives in the party that this new version is close enough to the original bill, and to persuade progressives in the House of Representative to pass a separate, $1tn infrastructure bill that has already passed in the Senate. It's a delicate balance for Mr Biden, as he tries to appeal to his party's progressives - who say they need action on the social spending bill before passing infrastructure - and some moderates, for whom the infrastructure bill is priority. Others had concerns over the price tag of the original social spending bill. So what's in the proposed new spending plan? $555bn aimed at fighting climate change, mainly through tax-incentives for renewable and low-emission sources of energy $400bn for free and universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds $165bn to lower health care premiums for the nine million Americans covered through the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare $150bn to build one million affordable housing units A 50-50 seat split in the Senate - and certain Republican resistance - means Mr Biden must bring his entire party on board if he hopes to pass the spending bill. Two moderate Democrats, Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, appeared to signal some support for the bill in separate statements on Thursday. \"After months of productive, good-faith negotiations with President Biden and the White House, we have made significant progress,\" Ms Sinema said. \"I look forward to getting this done.\" Both Ms Sinema and Mr Manchin are widely seen to have tanked the original bill by refusing to vote for it. For Mr Biden personally, a lot is riding on the fate of these two bills: his presidential legacy. \"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week,\" he told Democrats on Thursday morning, according to US media."], "id": "dff9f3f69783327675f46855df2d23692f88026232300e9495127e2241bfd28e", "highlighted_text": " Biden unveiled a revamped $1.75tn spending plan on Thursday They include major investments in climate it remains to be seen whether Biden achieved the cooperation needed within his party .

Biden\u2019s proposed framework includes $555 billion in clean energy investments, incentives and tax credits that would help the country meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030. If passed, environmental experts said it\u2019s the type of legislation that could create much-needed momentum to slash pollution levels and address the climate crisis in the United States and on the global stage. The proposal also backs up promises that Biden campaigned on, making climate change a sizable focus of his administration\u2019s biggest spending bill. \u201cThis would be an absolutely historic investment in clean energy and environmental justice \u2014 both of which are essential for climate progress,\u201d said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group based in San Francisco. \u201cA package that makes all those investments at a scale that will be transformative over the next eight years is incredible.\u201d The new framework comes after prolonged negotiations between the White House and two moderate Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Krysten Sinema of Arizona, who opposed key parts of Biden\u2019s original \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. Some environmental advocates had hoped for an even larger climate package. \u201cThe Build Back Better Framework announced by the White House today doesn\u2019t go far enough to address the economic and climate crises facing our generation,\u201d Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a progressive advocacy nonprofit started by billionaire and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, said in a news release. \u201cA few moderate Democrats negotiated against the best interest of the American people, forcing the rest of their party to renege on essential promises.\u201d Biden on Thursday urged Congress to pass the proposal, saying that the investments will \u201ctruly transform this nation.\u201d Earlier this year, the Senate passed a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure bill with robust bipartisan support, but the House has yet to vote on that measure, citing the need for parallel action on the social safety net portion of Biden\u2019s agenda. The bill\u2019s timing is crucial as Biden is set to meet with other world leaders in Scotland next week for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, where countries are expected to negotiate and set forth targets to reduce emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Stalled negotiations had generated concern among environmentalists around the world that Biden could show up to the conference empty-handed, leaving little incentive for other countries to offer their own aggressive plans to cut carbon emissions. Sam Ricketts, co-founder and co-director of the climate advocacy group Evergreen Action, said lawmakers should feel increased urgency to pass the revamped Build Back Better act, but added that the proposal itself should benefit Biden by demonstrating to other nations that the U.S. is actively working to achieve its emissions targets. \u201cThis will show the global community that America really is an ally and can be a leader in driving forward global climate efforts,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cIt shows that after four years of President Trump\u2019s outright climate denial, the U.S. government is moving with leadership against this global crisis.\u201d The proposed climate bill will also give the U.S. stronger footing in Scotland during negotiations with other top emitters, including China. \u201cThe Biden administration will have more leverage to push other countries to make strong commitments,\u201d said Danielle Arostegui, a senior climate analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cWe can show that we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is.\u201d The bill would significantly boost investments in renewable energy, including for solar and wind power, and would provide clean energy tax credits and an electric vehicle tax credit that would lower the cost of an electric vehicle by up to $12,500 per middle-class family, according to the White House. The framework also prioritizes environmental justice by earmarking 40 percent of the overall benefits of investment for disadvantaged communities. The plan would fund the electrification of ports, in addition to electrifying bus and truck fleets, and would provide grants to communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change and economic injustice. \u201cThis marks a new beginning in the fight against injustice in this country, and a long-overdue boost to the communities that have struggled with the toxic legacy of environmental pollution and systemic racism,\u201d officials with the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform, a consortium of climate change and environmental justice advocates, said in a statement. Dan Lashof, U.S. director of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research nonprofit group, said the legislation could bring the country significantly closer to meeting its emissions goals, but added that there is still ground to make up. The White House said the bill will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030, but Lashof said a total of 2 billion tons of emissions need to be cut to reach Biden\u2019s target by the end of the decade.

The Nation. Jan 13 2020. https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/nuclear-defense-climate-change/", "body": ["President Donald Trump may not accept the scientific reality of climate change, but the nation\u2019s senior military leaders recognize that climate disruption is already underway, and they are planning extraordinary measures to prevent it from spiraling into nuclear war. One particularly worrisome scenario is if extreme drought and abnormal monsoon rains devastate agriculture and unleash social chaos in Pakistan, potentially creating an opening for radical Islamists aligned with elements of the armed forces to seize some of the country\u2019s 150 or so nuclear weapons. To avert such a potentially cataclysmic development, the US Joint Special Operations Command has conducted exercises for infiltrating Pakistan and locating the country\u2019s nuclear munitions. Most of the necessary equipment for such raids is already in position at US bases in the region, according to a 2011 report from the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume that planning for the worst-case scenario regarding Pakistan\u2019s nukes has already taken place inside the US government,\u201d said Roger Cressey, a former deputy director for counterterrorism in Bill Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s administrations in 2011.", "Such an attack by the United States would be an act of war and would entail enormous risks of escalation, especially since the Pakistani military\u2014the country\u2019s most powerful institution\u2014views the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal as its most prized possession and would fiercely resist any US attempt to disable it. \u201cThese are assets which are the pride of Pakistan, assets which are\u2026guarded by a corps of 18,000 soldiers,\u201d former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf told NBC News in 2011. The Pakistani military \u201cis not an army which doesn\u2019t know how to fight. This is an army that has fought three wars. Please understand that.\u201d", "A potential US military incursion in nuclear-armed Pakistan is just one example of a crucial but little-\u200bdiscussed aspect of international politics in the early 21st century: how the acceleration of climate change and nuclear war planning may make those threats to human survival harder to defuse. At present, the intersections between climate change and nuclear war might not seem obvious. But powerful forces are pushing both threats toward their most destructive outcomes.", "In the case of climate change, the unbridled emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is raising global temperatures to unmistakably dangerous levels. Despite growing worldwide reliance on wind and solar power for energy generation, the global demand for oil and natural gas continues to rise, and carbon emissions are projected to remain on an upward trajectory for the foreseeable future. It is highly unlikely, then, that the increase in average global temperature can be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the aspirational goal adopted by the world\u2019s governments under the Paris Agreement in 2015, or even to 2\u00b0C, the actual goal. After that threshold is crossed, scientists agree, it will prove almost impossible to avert catastrophic outcomes, such as the collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and a resulting sea level rise of 6 feet or more.", "Climbing world temperatures and rising sea levels will diminish the supply of food and water in many resource-deprived areas, increasing the risk of widespread starvation, social unrest, and human flight. Global corn production, for example, is projected to fall by as much as 14 percent in a 2\u00b0C warmer world, according to research cited in a 2018 special report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Food scarcity and crop failures risk pushing hundreds of millions of people into overcrowded cities, where the likelihood of pandemics, ethnic strife, and severe storm damage is bound to increase. All of this will impose an immense burden on human institutions. Some states may collapse or break up into a collection of warring chiefdoms\u2014all fighting over sources of water and other vital resources.", "A similar momentum is now evident in the emerging nuclear arms race, with all three major powers\u2014China, Russia, and the United States\u2014rushing to deploy a host of new munitions. This dangerous process commenced a decade ago, when Russian and Chinese leaders sought improvements to their nuclear arsenals and President Barack Obama, in order to secure Senate approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010, agreed to initial funding for the modernization of all three legs of America\u2019s strategic triad, which encompasses submarines, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and bombers. (New START, which mandated significant reductions in US and Russian arsenals, will expire in February 2021 unless renewed by the two countries.) Although Obama initiated the modernization of the nuclear triad, the Trump administration has sought funds to proceed with their full-scale production, at an estimated initial installment of $500 billion over 10 years.", "Even during the initial modernization program of the Obama era, Russian and Chinese leaders were sufficiently alarmed to hasten their own nuclear acquisitions. Both countries were already in the process of modernizing their stockpiles\u2014Russia to replace Cold War\u2013era systems that had become unreliable, China to provide its relatively small arsenal with enhanced capabilities. Trump\u2019s decision to acquire a whole new suite of ICBMs, nuclear-armed submarines, and bombers has added momentum to these efforts. And with all three major powers upgrading their arsenals, the other nuclear-weapon states\u2014led by India, Pakistan, and North Korea\u2014have been expanding their stockpiles as well. Moreover, with Trump\u2019s recent decision to abandon the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, all major powers are developing missile delivery systems for a regional nuclear war such as might erupt in Europe, South Asia, or the western Pacific.", "All things being equal, rising temperatures will increase the likelihood of nuclear war, largely because climate change will heighten the risk of social stress, the decay of nation-states, and armed violence in general, as I argue in my new book, All Hell Breaking Loose. As food and water supplies dwindle and governments come under ever-increasing pressure to meet the vital needs of their populations, disputes over critical resources are likely to become more heated and violent, whether the parties involved have nuclear arms or not. But this danger is compounded by the possibility that several nuclear-armed powers\u2014notably India, Pakistan, and China\u2014will break apart as a result of climate change and accompanying battles over disputed supplies of water.", "Together, these three countries are projected by the UN Population Division to number approximately 3.4 billion people in 2050, or 34 percent of the world\u2019s population. Yet they possess a much smaller share of the world\u2019s freshwater supplies, and climate change is destined to reduce what they have even further. Warmer temperatures are also expected to diminish crop yields in these countries, adding to the desperation of farmers and very likely resulting in widespread ethnic strife and population displacement. Under these circumstances, climate-related internal turmoil would increase the risk of nuclear war in two ways: by enabling the capture of nuclear arms by rogue elements of the military and their possible use against perceived enemies and by inciting wars between these states over vital supplies ", "", "of water and other critical resources.", "The risk to Pakistan from climate change is thought to be particularly acute. A large part of the population is still engaged in agriculture, and much of the best land\u2014along with access to water\u2014is controlled by wealthy landowners (who also dominate national politics). Water scarcity and mismanagement is a perennial challenge, and climate change is bound to make the problem worse. Climate and Social Stress: Implications for Security Analysis, a 2013 report by the National Research Council for the US intelligence community, highlights the danger of chaos and conflict in that country as global warming advances. Pakistan, the report notes, is expected to suffer from inadequate water supplies during the dry season and severe flooding during the monsoon\u2014outcomes that will devastate its agriculture and amplify the poverty and unrest already afflicting much of the country. \u201cThe Pakistan case,\u201d the report reads, \u201cillustrates how a highly stressed environmental system on which a tense society depends can be a source of political instability and how that source can intensify when climate events put increased stress on the system.\u201d Thus, as global temperatures rise and agriculture declines, Pakistan could shatter along ethnic, class, and religious lines, precisely the scenario that might trigger the sort of intervention anticipated by the US Joint Special Operations Command.", "Assuming that Pakistan remains intact, another great danger arising from increasing world temperatures is a conflict between it and India or between China and India over access to shared river systems. Whatever their differences, Pakistan and western India are forced by geography to share a single river system, the Indus, for much of their water requirements. Likewise, western China and eastern India also share a river, the Brahmaputra, for their vital water needs. The Indus and the Brahmaputra obtain much of their flow from periods of heavy precipitation; they also depend on meltwater from Himalayan glaciers, and these are at risk of melting because of rising temperatures. According to the IPCC, the Himalayan glaciers could lose as much as 29 percent of their total mass by 2035 and 78 percent by 2100. This would produce periodic flooding as the ice melts but would eventually result in long periods of negligible flow, with calamitous consequences for downstream agriculture. The widespread starvation and chaos that could result would prove daunting to all the governments involved and make any water-related disputes between them a potential flash point for escalation.", "As in Pakistan, water supply has always played a pivotal role in the social and economic life of China and India, with both countries highly dependent on a few major river systems for civic and agricultural purposes. Excessive rainfall can lead to catastrophic flooding, and prolonged drought has often led to widespread famine and mass starvation. In such a setting, water management has always been a prime responsibility of government\u2014and a failure to fulfill this function effectively has often resulted in civil unrest. Climate change is bound to increase this danger by causing prolonged water shortages interspersed with severe flooding. This has prompted leaders of both countries to build ever more dams on all key rivers.", "India, as the upstream power on several tributaries of the Indus, and China, as the upstream power on the Brahmaputra, have considered damming these rivers and diverting their waters for exclusive national use, thereby diminishing the flow to downstream users. Three of the Indus\u2019s principal tributaries, the Jhelum, Chenab, and Ravi rivers, flow through Indian-controlled Kashmir (now in total lockdown, with government forces suppressing all public functions). It\u2019s possible that India seeks full control of Kashmir in order to dam the tributaries there and divert their waters from Pakistan\u2014a move that could easily trigger a war if it occurs at a time of severe food and water stress and one that would very likely invite the use of nuclear weapons, given Pakistan\u2019s attitude toward them.", "The situation regarding the Brahmaputra could prove equally precarious. China has already installed one dam on the river, the Zangmu Dam in Tibet, and has announced plans for several more. Some Chinese hydrologists have proposed the construction of canals linking the Brahmaputra to more northerly rivers in China, allowing the diversion of its waters to drought-stricken areas of the heavily populated northeast. These plans have yet to come to fruition, but as global warming increases water scarcity across northern China, Beijing might proceed with the idea. \u201cIf China was determined to move forward with such a scheme,\u201d the US National Intelligence Council warned in 2009, \u201cit could become a major element in pushing China and India towards an adversarial rather than simply a competitive relationship.\u201d", "Severe water scarcity in northern China could prompt yet another move with nuclear implications: an attempted annexation by China of largely uninhabited but water-rich areas of Russian Siberia. Thousands of Chinese farmers and merchants have already taken up residence in eastern Siberia, and some commentators have spoken of a time when climate change prompts a formal Chinese takeover of those areas\u2014which would almost certainly prompt fierce Russian resistance and the possible use of nuclear weapons.", "In the Arctic, global warming is producing a wholly different sort of peril: geopolitical competition and conflict made possible by the melting of the polar ice cap. Before long, the Arctic ice cap is expected to disappear in summertime and to shrink noticeably in the winter, making the region more attractive for resource extraction. According to the US Geological Survey, an estimated 30 percent of the world\u2019s remaining undiscovered natural gas is above the Arctic Circle; vast reserves of iron ore, uranium, and rare earth minerals are also thought to be buried there. These resources, along with the appeal of faster commercial shipping routes linking Europe and Asia, have induced all the major powers, including China, to establish or expand operations in the region. Russia has rehabilitated numerous Arctic bases abandoned after the Cold War and built others; the United States has done likewise, modernizing its radar installation at Thule in Greenland, reoccupying an airfield at Keflav\u00edk in Iceland, and establishing bases in northern Norway.", "Increased economic and military competition in the Arctic has significant nuclear implications, as numerous weapons are deployed there and geography lends it a key role in many nuclear scenarios. Most of Russia\u2019s missile-carrying submarines are based near Murmansk, on the Barents Sea (an offshoot of the Arctic Ocean), and many of its nuclear-armed bombers are also at bases in the region to take advantage of the short polar route to North America. As a counterweight, the Pentagon has deployed additional subs and antisubmarine aircraft near the Barents Sea and interceptor aircraft in Alaska, followed by further measures by Moscow. \u201cI do not want to stoke any fears here,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin declared in June 2017, \u201cbut experts are aware that US nuclear submarines remain on duty in northern Norway\u2026. We must protect [Russia\u2019s] shore accordingly.\u201d", "On the other side of the equation, an intensifying arms race will block progress against climate change by siphoning resources needed for a global energy transition and by poisoning the relations among the great powers, impeding joint efforts to slow the warming.", "With the signing of the Paris Agreement, it appeared that the great powers might unite in a global effort to slash greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to avoid catastrophe, but those hopes have since receded. At the time, Obama emphasized that limiting global warming would require nations to work together in an environment of trust and peaceful cooperation. Instead of leading the global transition to a postcarbon energy system, however, the major powers are spending massively to enhance their military capabilities and engaging in conflict-provoking behaviors.", "Since fiscal year 2016, the annual budget of the US Department of Defense has risen from $580 billion to $738 billion in fiscal year 2020. When the budget increases for each fiscal year since 2016 are combined, the United States will have spent an additional $380 billion on military programs by the end of this fiscal year\u2014more than enough to jump-start the transition to a carbon-\u200bfree economy. If the Pentagon budget rises as planned to $747 billion in fiscal year 2024, a total of $989 billion in additional spending will have been devoted to military operations and procurement over this period, leaving precious little money for a Green New Deal or any other scheme for systemic decarbonization.", "Meanwhile, policy-makers in Washington, Beijing, and Moscow increasingly regard one another as implacable and dangerous adversaries. \u201cAs China and Russia seek to expand their global influence,\u201d then\u2013Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats informed Congress in a January 2019 report, \u201cthey are eroding once well-established security norms and increasing the risk of regional conflicts.\u201d Chinese and Russian officials have been making similar statements about the United States. Secondary powers like India, Pakistan, and Turkey are also assuming increasingly militaristic postures, facilitating the potential spread of nuclear weapons and exacerbating regional tensions. In this environment, it is almost impossible to imagine future climate negotiations at which the great powers agree on concrete measures for a rapid transition to a clean energy economy.", "In a world constantly poised for nuclear war while facing widespread state decay from climate disruption, these twin threats would intermingle and intensify each other. Climate-\u200brelated resource stresses and disputes would increase the level of global discord and the risk of nuclear escalation; the nuclear arms race would poison relations between states and make a global energy transition impossible."], "id": "93ed896607da9fe69b104651bdf57708067ff449efb1a7d9fe656b9a1ac241c7", "highlighted_text": " extreme drought and rains  unleash chaos in Pakistan opening

power, so the Neo-Brandeisians argue, such companies should be broken up. Idealising the break-ups in antitrust history, Neo-Brandeisians think that breaking up big tech is a legally clean, economically harmless and socially useful (structural) remedy available to antitrust agencies. Such calls for break-ups have achieved momentum in the media but have so far failed to win support in academic and regulatory circles, for two reasons: historic break-ups have been failures; and big tech break-ups would be failures.", "Historically, structural remedies such as break-ups have done more harm than good. The US antitrust history of structural remedies forcing companies to break up is blatantly miserable:", "[F]resh memories of the deconcentration experiences of the 1970s have convinced many that the divestiture suit is a hopelessly flawed instrument of antitrust policy. In many respects it is harder today than it was in the early 1930s to imagine a revival of the section two divestiture action as an important antitrust weapon. (Kovacic, 1989, p. 1149)", "And yet, even in 1930s and before, break-ups of companies had appeared to fail to achieve their objectives and to do more harm than good. The break-up of the Standard Oil Trust19 and the \u201ccrusade against Aluminium Company of America\u201d are attacks that \u201cended up with a ceremony of atonement, but few practical results\u201d, and failed because \u201cthere were no new organizations growing up to take over the functions of those under attack\u201d (Arnold, 1937, p. 220). Historically, the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and the restructuring of AT&T in the 1980s \u2013 the main prime instances of divestures in US antitrust policy \u2013 were assessed with \u201crecurring criticism that the execution of admittedly sweeping relief was either counterproductive or essentially superfluous\u201d (Kovacic, 1989, p. 1106).", "Structural remedies imposed on big tech companies would harm consumers and deter innovation. Rather than being \u201cclean\u201d, the proposed \u201cforced breakup of unlawful monopolists is much riskier because bad judicially imposed breakups can create weak firms and undermine innovation\u201d (Bohannan & Hovenkamp, 2012, p. 11). Any break-up would ignore the fragile ecosystem within which big tech companies evolve: one set of activities may be revenue-generating only because another set of activities is not revenue-generating. In a zero-priced market, services funded by advertisements are provided to end-consumers on the basis of algorithm-driven data accumulation enabling revenue. For instance, Facebook Messenger may not be revenue generating whereas Facebook's advertisements are the core of Facebook's economic viability. Also, Google Shopping may not be revenue-generating whereas Google Search advertisements are the main source of income. Equally, Amazon as a platform provides a clearing house for price comparisons amongst widgets whereas Amazon as a retailer provides for more efficient competition on a limited set of products when efficiencies are possible. Separating one part of the ecosystem from another \u2013 that is, the platform from the commerce (Khan, 2019) \u2013 would lower the overall viability of the ecosystem without providing evidence for increased innovation and enhanced consumer welfare.20", "Neo-Brandeisians vouching for break-ups of big tech companies should remember the words of Justice Brandeis himself, who, despite being a vigorous advocate of small firms, admitted that under US antitrust laws \u201cthere is nothing in our industrial history to indicate that there is any need whatever to limit the natural growth of a business in order to preserve competition\u201d (Brandeis, 1913, p. 6).

Cursory inspection of its 756 pages suggests that it\u2019s just another standard product of the military-industrial complex that so worried President Eisenhower at the end of his term of office. On closer examination, however, it turns out to be a set of case notes on a tragic case of what we psychologists call \u201chegemonic anxiety\u201d \u2013 the fear of losing global dominance. The report is the work of 15 bigwigs, led by Dr Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Alphabet (and before that the adult supervisor imposed by venture capitalists on the young co-founders of Google). Of the 15 members of the commission only four are female. Eight are from the tech industry (including Andy Jassy, Jeff Bezos\u2019s anointed heir at Amazon); two are former senior Pentagon officials; and the tech sector of the national intelligence community is represented by at least three commissioners. Given these establishment credentials, the only surprising thing is that the inquiry seems to have been set up during Trump\u2019s presidency, which suggests that it was organised by the \u201cdeep state\u201d during the hours of one to four AM, when Trump was generally asleep. What have these luminaries concluded? Basically that there\u2019s a \u201cnew era of competition\u201d ahead, which \u201cpromises to change the world we live in and how we live within it\u201d. The US \u201ccan either shape the change to come or be swept along by it\u201d. There are \u201cadversaries\u201d out there (name begins with \u201cC\u201d) who \u201care determined to turn AI capabilities against us\u201d, and one of them (see above) is \u201cdetermined to surpass us in AI leadership\u201d. Advances in AI confer significant first-mover advantages, so \u201cnow we must act \u2013 the United States should invest what it takes to maintain its innovation leadership, to responsibly use AI to defend free people and free societies, and to advance the frontiers of science for the benefit of all humanity. AI is going to reorganise the world. America must lead the charge.\u201d Cue trumpet voluntary. Pathological anxiety about China runs through the entire document like the words in a stick of Blackpool rock. \u201cOn a level playing field,\u201d it burbles, \u201cthe United States is capable of out-innovating any competitor.\u201d But apparently there is \u201ca fundamental difference in the US and China\u2019s approaches to AI innovation that puts American AI leadership in peril\u201d. The playing field, it seems, is not level because US tech companies \u201care not instruments of state power\u201d. Since \u201cChina is organised, resourced, and determined to win the technology competition\u201d, the US approach has to change. What\u2019s needed, apparently, is \u201ca hybrid approach meshing government and private-sector efforts to win the technology competition\u201d. Pause, for a moment, to extract the signal from this message. First, the gobbledegook about \u201cAI\u201d is in fact almost entirely about machine learning, a flaky technology that has an insatiable demand for detailed data about humans and their activities. The Chinese are ahead because their tech companies have to turn all their data over to the authorities; Americans are hobbled because, while their state can always get the data from the tech companies that hoover it up, sometimes it has to jump through legal hoops to get it. The \u201chybrid approach\u201d that is deemed necessary involves \u201cmeshing\u201d the US government with the country\u2019s tech companies. Now what might that imply? You only have to ask the question to know the answer. If American tech giants are finally recognised as strategic partners of the US government in the coming existential hegemonic struggle with China, then Washington\u2019s enthusiasm for curbing said monopolies will rapidly decrease. Indeed, this may already be happening, if an inspection of the number of tech-company insiders who have been recruited by Biden is anything to go by. And the argument made to the US Congress by, among others, Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 that shackling US tech giants will guarantee Chinese hegemony \u2013 will once again find a ready audience in Washington. Reading the commission\u2019s report brings with it a strange sense of deja vu. It reminds me of the moment in October 1957 when the Eisenhower administration discovered that the Soviet Union had successfully launched a satellite into orbit, thereby triggering a chronic outbreak of hegemonic anxiety in the US. That shock prompted the kind of massive reorientation and resource commitment that Eric Schmidt and his fellow commissioners are now calling for \u2013 and ultimately led to the creation of the Arpanet, the precursor of the internet we all use today. What\u2019s worrying about that historical parallel is that the American response to the Sputnik challenge did not undermine its democracy \u2013 and in fact in the long run may have led to the eventual implosion of the Soviet regime. But if Schmidt and co have their way now, the US might be left as the hollowed-out shell of a republic facing a dominant and data-fuelled totalitarian China. The technological has been political for the past two decades; from now on it\u2019ll be geopolitical. And either way democracy will be the loser.", "", ""], "id": "f07a541a865952f795b860a7937ae1532cc0ffe540434e788c677bc3fae661a0", "highlighted_text": " another standard product of the military-industrial complex what psychologists call \u201c hegemonic anxiety \u201d \u2013 the fear of losing global dominance the inquiry was organised by the \u201cdeep state these luminaries concluded that there\u2019s a \u201cnew era of competition Pathological anxiety about China runs through the entire document the argument that shackling US tech giants will guarantee Chinese hegemony \u2013 will once again find a ready audience in Washington the American response to Sputnik challenge did not undermine democracy", "highlights": [[3, 166, 225], [3, 388, 392], [3, 396, 416], [3, 416, 433], [3, 433, 472], [3, 1044, 1055], [3, 1132, 1164], [3, 1245, 1271], [3, 1283, 1321], [3, 2058, 2123], [3, 3882, 3894], [3, 3955, 4018], [3, 4019, 4070], [3, 4680, 4704], [3, 4709, 4744], [3, 4749, 4758]], "underlines": [[3, 10, 104], [3, 166, 225], [3, 348, 387], [3, 388, 392], [3, 393, 395], [3, 396, 416], [3, 416, 433], [3, 433, 472], [3, 472, 473], [3, 473, 473], [3, 474, 510], [3, 669, 759], [3, 822, 862], [3, 971, 1043], [3, 1044, 1055], [3, 1056, 1131], [3, 1132, 1164], [3, 1164, 1234], [3, 1234, 1234], [3, 1235, 1244], [3, 1245, 1271], [3, 1283, 1321], [3, 1475, 1508], [3, 1532, 1588], [3, 1967, 2057], [3, 2057, 2057], [3, 2058, 2123], [3, 2124, 2167], [3, 2170, 2417], [3, 2775, 2835], [3, 2844, 3075], [3, 3076, 3083], [3, 3084, 3127], [3, 3501, 3725], [3, 3882, 3894], [3, 3895, 3899], [3, 3900, 3954], [3, 3955, 4018], [3, 4019, 4070], [3, 4070, 4071], [3, 4071, 4071], [3, 4072, 4190], [3, 4625, 4679], [3, 4680, 4704], [3, 4705, 4708], [3, 4709, 4744], [3, 4745, 4748], [3, 4749, 4758], [3, 4759, 5149]], "emphasis": [[3, 166, 225], [3, 416, 433], [3, 1283, 1321], [3, 2058, 2123], [3, 4019, 4070], [3, 4070, 4071], [3, 4625, 4679], [3, 4680, 4704], [3, 4705, 4708], [3, 4709, 4744], [3, 4745, 4748], [3, 4749, 4758], [3, 4759, 5149]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 15]], "filename": "neg-6.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2021-03-06"}, {"tag": "[3] Tech leadership doesn\u2019t enable Chinese expansionism", "cite": "Emewu 20", "body": ["(Ikenna, https://africachinapresscentre.org/2020/08/23/rise-of-chinese-ai-and-quantum-computing-threatens-american-military-tech-says-report-for-us-congress/)", "\u201cSuperior military technology could make the PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] an even more formidable foe for the US military. The current US strategy \u2026 is to rely on superior technological and qualitative advantage to compensate for quantitative inferiority.

However, China\u2019s advantages diminished the further from China\u2019s shores the PLA operated, Heath said. \u201cFor most South China Sea scenarios, such as near the Spratly Islands, the PLA would probably be quickly and easily overwhelmed by an intervening US naval and air force if it operated from a carrier battle group or from the Philippines,\u201d he said. Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the days of China lagging well behind the US in military technology were long gone. \u201cIn many areas they [China] are equivalent, and in some areas, they are surpassing the US, such as hypersonics, AI and quantum tech.

Rather than rely on market share as the alarm bell that signals the need for antitrust enforcement, regulators should focus more on firms\u2019 conduct, and they should look first to behavioral remedies, not structural ones.

At the same time, miscalculation is always possible and some see the danger of \u2018sleepwalking\u2019 into catastrophe, as happened with World War I.", "History is replete with cases of misperception about changing power balances. For example, when US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, he wanted to balance what he saw as a growing Soviet threat to a declining America. But what Nixon interpreted as decline was really the return to normal of America\u2019s artificially high share of global output after World War II.", "Nixon proclaimed multipolarity, but what followed was the end of the Soviet Union and America\u2019s unipolar moment two decades later.

Will Chinese leaders take more risks, or will Chinese and Americans learn to cooperate in producing global public goods under a changing distribution of power?", "Recall that Thucydides attributed the war that ripped apart the ancient Greek world to two causes: the rise of a new power and the fear that this created in the established power. The second cause is as important as the first. The US and China must avoid exaggerated fears that could create a new cold or hot war.", "Even if China surpasses the US to become the world\u2019s largest economy, national income is not the only measure of geopolitical power.

The US is surrounded by oceans and neighbours that are likely to remain friendly. China has borders with 14 countries, and territorial disputes with India, Japan and Vietnam set limits on its hard and soft power.", "Energy is another area where America has an advantage. A decade ago, the US was dependent on imported energy, but the shale revolution transformed North America from energy importer to exporter. At the same time, China became more dependent on energy imports from the Middle East, which it must transport along sea routes that highlight its problematic relations with India and other countries.", "The US also has demographic advantages.

A wide array of scholars and public intellectuals, including such notable figures as Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz4 and Paul Krugman5 and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich,6 among others, have claimed that monopoly and anticompetitive market conditions are among the root causes of wealth inequality.7 Some of these commentators blame the rising tide of wealth inequality on a weak record of antitrust enforcement in the United States.8 All seem to propose that enhancing antitrust enforcement against mergers, monopolies, and anticompetitive agreements could contribute to creating a more equal society.", "This Article challenges this emerging monopoly regressivity claim in two ways. First, it shows that the relationship between enforcement of the antitrust laws and wealth inequality is far more complex than monopoly regressivity critics recognize. The relationship between market power (the subject of antitrust law) and income distribution is subtle, circumstantially contingent, and, at least for a developed economy, extremely difficult to generalize. Whatever their other faults, it is far from certain that antitrust violations (including cartels, anticompetitive mergers, and abuses of dominance) systematically redirect wealth from the poor to the rich. To sustain a showing that they do, one would need information about a large number of factors, including the relative wealth of producers and consumers, overcharge pass-on rates, the effects of market power on employees of the firm, the distribution of rents between managers and shareholders, the progressive or regressive effects of antitrust violations where government entities are the purchasers, and the distribution of rents among classes of managers. Although there are undoubtedly cases where antitrust violations have regressive effects, there are also undoubtedly many cases where their effects are progressive or distributively neutral. It is virtually impossible to calculate the net effect on wealth distribution from general increases or decreases in overall antitrust enforcement.", "The second response this Article makes to the monopoly regressivity claim is that a significant set of antitrust interventions actually impede voluntary efforts to secure a more equitable and just society. ", "", "In a set of important cases, application of conventional antitrust principles frustrated private actors seeking to promote social justice by diverting market forces from their ordinary paths.9 Hence, an undifferentiated increase in antitrust enforcement could, in many instances, exacerbate rather than diminish inequality and related forms of social justice.", "To motivate this angle, consider some glimpses of the kinds of cases in which antitrust has posed an obstacle to private actors pursuing wealth redistribution goals. Examples include an antitrust challenge to an agreement by the Ivy League universities on a financial aid system designed to increase educational diversity;10 antitrust concerns preventing garment manufacturers in the United States from joining forces to pressure foreign suppliers to conform to minimal labor and employment standards;11 and antitrust challenges to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules prohibiting its members from paying student athletes, which could disrupt the cross subsidization of women\u2019s athletic programs and other less popular sporting programs.12 In each of these cases, discussed in greater detail below, there is a plausible argument that application of unqualified antitrust principles would increase the welfare of consumers but also impair the ability of private actors to pursue solutions to serious equality problems. ", "In tandem, these twin objections throw a wrench into the growing progressive claim that more antitrust enforcement would lead to a more just distribution of wealth. Not only could an undifferentiated increase in antitrust enforcement exacerbate wealth inequality in various ways but it could also impede private, voluntary pursuit of related social justice objectives.", "Thus far, this introduction has considered the effect of an undifferentiated increase in antitrust enforcement\u2014actions to augment and strengthen enforcement as a general matter, such as by providing more funding to the antitrust agencies, liberalizing rules for private enforcement, increasing fines and penalties, or adopting rules making antitrust claims easier to win. Changes in the level of antitrust enforcement have no clear effect on the regressivity or progressivity of wealth distribution and social justice more generally, but one could try to tailor antitrust policy to maximize wealth redistribution and social justice in particular cases. Although it might sometimes be prudent as a matter of prosecutorial discretion to prioritize resource allocation in the direction of fighting antitrust violations with highly regressive effects, it would be a mistake to recalibrate antitrust doctrine in an effort to combat wealth inequality. Even putting aside the likely deleterious effects on productive and allocative efficiency such doctrinal shifts might entail, it is impossible to craft a distributively-oriented body of antitrust law that would reliably increase wealth equality by clamping down on regressive forms of market power exploitation.", ""], "id": "914799714093289290825991ffd5c3b27143e803567ad4715e01757374265807", "highlighted_text": " scholars claimed anticompetitive conditions are the causes of wealth inequality the relationship between antitrust and inequality is far more complex antitrust violations are progressive or neutral .

As Mark Roe has noted, \u201c[e]mployees of monopoly firms can, and do, ally with capital to split the rents, to facilitate constricting production and raising price, and to seek barriers to competitive entry.\u201d 84 Empirical evidence shows that nonunion employees see higher wages as the market concentration of their industry increases and also that higher seller concentration leads to stronger unionization, which in turn leads to higher wages.85 The monopoly labor wage premium has been observed across a variety of industries.86 For present purposes, the monopoly labor wage premium is important because it suggests the ability of blue-collar workers to extract significant monopoly rents from their employers, thus counterbalancing any regressive effects from shareholder or senior management rent extraction.87", "Consistent with the evidence that increases in market power yield higher wages for blue-collar employees, there is evidence of labor union support for large corporate mergers that raise serious competitive issues. For example, the Communication Workers of America came out in favor of the AT&T and T-Mobile merger that the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department both opposed, and that AT&T and Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile\u2019s parent corporation, ultimately withdrew from.88 An editorial published in the Huffington Post explained that progressives should support the proposed merger \u201c[b]ecause AT&T is the ONLY unionized wireless company in the country and the merger would ensure that 20,000+ T-Mobile workers would have the chance to join the 43,000 currently unionized AT&T Mobility employees with decent wages and legal protections on the job.\u201d89 Similarly, the three airline employee unions supported American Airlines\u2019 questionable merger with US Airways, believing that employees would fare better in the combined company.90", "A related point concerns the differentiating effects among different classes of workers from increases in product market competition. Such competition may increase wage inequality by shifting demand in favor of skilled labor at the expense of unskilled labor, with the effect that a wage gap grows between skilled and unskilled labor.91 Such instances of income stratification have ambiguous effects on the overall distribution of wealth but would likely be regressive on net since they would shift down the average salaries of workers at the lowest end of the income distribution.", "The progressive effects of market power\u2013enhancing mergers may go beyond the financially quantifiable and spill outside the boundaries of the firm. Civil rights organizations have supported controversial mergers, arguing that the combined firm would cater better to the needs of minorities. For example, the Reverend Al Sharpton played a leading role in supporting the Comcast and NBC Universal merger, arguing that the deal would enhance racial diversity in broadcasting.92 The NAACP supported the AT&T and T-Mobile merger, arguing that AT&T had been a progressive corporate citizen that would bring a better culture to T-Mobile\u2019s employment conditions and contracting practices.93 It also supported the Sirius and XM merger, which resulted in a monopoly in satellite radio.94 Other civil rights organizations have similarly weighed in favor of mergers ultimately challenged on antitrust grounds.95", "At a minimum, the monopoly labor wage premium and evidence of union and civil rights organization support for competitively controversial corporate mergers should call into question the progressive argument that stronger merger enforcement would advance progressive wealth redistribution.

As noted previously, however, state economic regulatory power during this time was generally given a wide berth, extending even to entities that were based well outside the state. And, notwithstanding the expansion in the size and scope of businesses, a substantial amount of economic activity unfolded within state borders, and so would be well within the state's reach even under this theory. Indeed, as late as the 1960's, most antitrust violations the Department of Justice prosecuted unfolded within a single state's jurisdiction.1 0 3 Seventy years before, in an era of \"relatively insignificant commercial intercourse between the states,\"10 4 this concentration would only have been more pronounced.", "A final efficacy argument concerns the fear that antitrust enforcement, far from being too weak, was in fact too strong, and so risked scaring away businesses from the state.

As a matter of political economy, much of the agitation for antitrust law, and many of the most potent political interest groups in states, were incumbent local business owners who feared national entrants. 1 0 6 Given this influence, it seems odd to assert that a prosecutor or governor's incentives would be to avoid antitrust enforcement to keep big businesses in-state. If anything, one would expect the opposite: that causing the exit of large out-of-state competitors would be viewed as a political victory. 107", "Moreover, as a matter of economics, vigorous antitrust enforcement, far from driving businesses away, would actually create superior competitive and economic conditions, and would arguably create more economic activity in the long run.10 s Last, the argument that state enforcement lagged due to fears of driving away business seems to presuppose that, if found liable, companies would be either ousted from the state or would leave voluntarily. Yet it is far from clear that this happened. To the contrary (and to the dismay of some prosecutors) courts seldom ordered complete ousters, but instead ordered massive fines against companies, suggesting that, at least in large measure, states

Much of antitrust law is built on finding the perfect balance of standards and remedies: the law must properly deter anticompetitive acts without deterring healthy competition. A state law that shifts remedies or standards can upset this careful balancing, thus overdeterring desirable private action.", "Critics can point directly to ARC America as evidence of this overdeterrence threat.

The degree of federal enforcement has risen and fallen based upon different executive administrative goals. 144 Recent state action reflects the established trend of state involvement increasing in times of more lax federal enforcement.145", "State and federal enforcers vary in organization and purpose. The primary federal antitrust enforcers, the DOJ and FTC, generally divide sectors of the economy based on their enforcement history. The DOJ is a federal law enforcement agency with a greater range of remedies than is enjoyed by the FTC, including criminal prosecution. 146 The FTC is a bipartisan group with the dual missions of promoting competition and protecting consumers, and may target more extensive ranges of behavior by enforcing the Federal Trade Commission Act against \"unfair competition.\" 14 7 The states' domain is consumer protection of their citizens. States are not limited to suing under federal law and may bring actions available to them under their respective state's law. 148 Even with application of the same law, there are many different logistical considerations, such as limited staff and resources devoted to antitrust. These logistical difficulties cause most multistate actions to be led by larger states, with smaller states only contributing their limited sized antitrust sections as support.149 Another significant difference between the enforcers is that state enforcers are generally elected officials while federal enforcers are appointed officials. 150 As elected officials, States' Attorneys General are representing their constituents and will enforce antitrust in a manner that best benefits those constituents.", "State action is continuing to rise, with collective action becoming a cemented enforcement strategy. 151 The National Association of Attorneys General (\"NAAG\") serves to help organize disparate state enforcers and gives them a forum to discuss enforcement policies and cooperation. 15 2 The NAAG emulates a federal agency in geographic breadth of enforcement but is comprised of individual states and their elected officials (the States' Attorneys General).1 53 It achieves its influence through standing committees and task forces, including its Multistate Antitrust Task Force. 154"], "id": "b25d57dcf42eb59c08ed061daca3dd514572106717e63c625ccf888126851105", "highlighted_text": " state action reflects increasing  in times of lax fed logistical difficulties cause multistate to be led by larger states State action is continuing to rise , with collective action  becoming cemented strategy NAAG organize disparate enforcers gives them forum  to discuss policies NAAG emulates federal agency in geographic breadth achieves influence through committees  and task forces", "highlights": [[3, 398, 419], [3, 463, 473], [3, 473, 473], [3, 474, 485], [3, 491, 498], [4, 917, 940], [4, 941, 946], [4, 952, 962], [4, 971, 983], [4, 984, 997], [5, 0, 15], [5, 16, 34], [5, 34, 35], [5, 36, 40], [5, 41, 58], [5, 58, 58], [5, 59, 67], [5, 70, 78], [5, 91, 99], [5, 153, 157], [5, 175, 193], [5, 200, 209], [5, 214, 224], [5, 227, 232], [5, 232, 232], [5, 233, 243], [5, 256, 264], [5, 291, 295], [5, 296, 304], [5, 307, 324], [5, 325, 343], [5, 465, 473], [5, 478, 495], [5, 505, 515], [5, 515, 515], [5, 516, 519], [5, 520, 531]], "underlines": [[3, 0, 7], [3, 31, 38], [3, 39, 64], [3, 90, 100], [3, 125, 129], [3, 130, 145], [3, 146, 172], [3, 279, 292], [3, 293, 312], [3, 313, 344], [3, 345, 364], [3, 380, 385], [3, 391, 397], [3, 398, 419], [3, 436, 462], [3, 463, 473], [3, 474, 485], [3, 491, 498], [3, 498, 514], [4, 74, 101], [4, 120, 194], [4, 632, 642], [4, 643, 654], [4, 655, 727], [4, 728, 756], [4, 762, 815], [4, 826, 851], [4, 853, 916], [4, 917, 940], [4, 941, 946], [4, 947, 951], [4, 952, 962], [4, 963, 970], [4, 971, 983], [4, 984, 997], [4, 999, 1018], [4, 1024, 1036], [4, 1043, 1086], [5, 0, 15], [5, 16, 34], [5, 36, 40], [5, 41, 58], [5, 59, 67], [5, 68, 69], [5, 70, 78], [5, 79, 90], [5, 91, 99], [5, 153, 157], [5, 160, 174], [5, 175, 193], [5, 194, 199], [5, 200, 209], [5, 210, 213], [5, 214, 224], [5, 225, 226], [5, 227, 232], [5, 233, 243], [5, 243, 243], [5, 244, 255], [5, 256, 264], [5, 265, 268], [5, 269, 280], [5, 291, 295], [5, 296, 304], [5, 305, 306], [5, 307, 324], [5, 325, 343], [5, 344, 378], [5, 390, 396], [5, 462, 464], [5, 465, 473], [5, 478, 495], [5, 496, 504], [5, 505, 515], [5, 516, 519], [5, 520, 531], [5, 533, 578]], "emphasis": [[3, 31, 38], [3, 130, 145], [3, 293, 312], [3, 345, 364], [3, 380, 385], [3, 463, 473], [3, 491, 498], [3, 498, 514], [4, 74, 101], [4, 643, 654], [4, 728, 756], [4, 826, 851], [4, 917, 940], [4, 984, 997], [5, 16, 34], [5, 41, 58], [5, 70, 78], [5, 79, 90], [5, 91, 99], [5, 153, 157], [5, 175, 193], [5, 194, 199], [5, 200, 209], [5, 227, 232], [5, 244, 255], [5, 256, 264], [5, 269, 280], [5, 296, 304], [5, 325, 343], [5, 390, 396], [5, 496, 504], [5, 505, 515], [5, 520, 531]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 10]], "filename": "neg-6.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2021-01-01"}, {"tag": "CASE", "cite": "Beaupre \u201920 [Jacob; Associate @ Nicolaides Fink Thorpe Michaelides Sullivan LLP, JD @ DePaul University College of Law; \u201cBig Is Not Always Bad: The Misuse of Antitrust Law to Break up Big Tech Companies,\u201d DePaul Business & Commercial Law Journal 18(1), p. 25-48; AS]", "body": ["Proponents of breaking up Big Tech view a breakup as a panacea that would solve the ills of competition and data privacy on the internet.

Digital platforms should remain platforms \u2013 an unprecedented way to minimise transaction costs with greater match of demand and supply \u2013 without entering the realm of selling products or providing other services otherwise provided by competitors. The European Commission notably illustrates this implicit requirement of neutrality, embedded within the legal requirement of absence of any discrimination, with the Google Shopping decision (European Commission, 2017).", "In Google Shopping, the remedy was not so much a break-up (although some commentators hinted at it) but the surreptitious concept of \u201csearch neutrality\u201d (Portuese, 2017; 2018). After network neutrality and after net neutrality, the rising notion of search neutrality implies that search results should be listed in a non-discriminatory manner by Google's algorithms. Updated on a weekly basis, Google's algorithms should nevertheless ensure that Google Shopping results and third-party results are listed without discrimination in a fair and equitable manner. Ignoring the competition exerted by Amazon, and not requiring equally neutral search results on Amazon's platform, the European Commission has erred in assessing the driving force of the development of Google Shopping, which is to compete with Amazon on an equal footing with the understandable bias each algorithm displays towards the firm's own products and against competitors' products. Equivalent to prominent placements in end-aisles of supermarkets by the supermarkets' own brands, prominent placements in search results enable Google to innovate in both the products displayed and the display itself. The prohibition of such biased algorithmic ordering of search results means that the regulator has the duty to oversee the neutrality of algorithmic orderings, thereby overseeing the neutrality of the algorithmic design. Given the regular updates of Google's algorithms, and given the pace of innovation and change in such disruptive markets, compliance with the Google Shopping decision would require intense scrutiny by the European Commission into the weekly working of Google's core asset, namely its algorithms.", "As illustrative as it can be, the Google Shopping decision and the compliance with it demonstrate both the war the Neo-Brandeisians are conducting on big tech companies and the associated increase in the role of government in regulating these companies. It is conducive to a shift from big tech companies towards big government whereby algorithmic governability, algorithmic governance, and algorithmic transparency are new regulatory concepts enabling governments to regulate these companies as public utilities. Antitrust populists argue that they should be regulated as public utilities because of their size. But, quite apart from the risks of regulatory capture and induced entrenchment of these firms as dominant companies, where is the notion of the indispensability of these companies?", "Big tech companies may be regulated as public utilities21 only if they are to be considered as natural monopolies. But, as big tech companies are neither natural nor monopolies, governments unnecessarily run the risk of creating regulatory costs (regulatory capture and transaction costs) without demonstrating the benefits of such actions. In other words, based on historical failures to break up companies and on unproven benefits of breaking up tech companies, the structural remedies suggested by Neo-Brandeisians are inappropriate both in their strong version (break-ups) and in their light version (public utilities management). Such potential micromanagement of firms by governments would induce intrusions in dynamic sectors of our economy at the expense of innovation, market incentives, and market performance.", "The basic tenets of antitrust populism can and should be debunked not only because of the absence of clear benefits flowing from the proposed reforms, but also because of the flawed conceptual analysis these reforms rest on. In an age of digital disruption, where the quest for innovation should be at the forefront of the minds not only of entrepreneurs but also of regulators, there is no need for a revived antitrust populism; on the contrary, there is a need for an innovation-based antitrust grounded in economic analysis using the consumer welfare standard (Kerber, 2017).

The empirical literature on this issue is, however, limited and ambiguous (see supra, section 3.2.). The reason for this may, once more, be found in the incentives. An online marketplace\u2014such as Amazon\u2019s\u2014cannot discriminate against too many of its sellers, as this could negatively affect the health of its ecosystem: a platform with a reputation for exclusion may not attract or retain enough participants to give it the necessary volume and diversity.198 It is difficult to say which incentives will dominate: those to capture more of the value in the ecosystem through vertical exclusion, or those to preserve the overall health of the ecosystem. The on-going investigations into the potentially exclusionary conduct by Amazon199 and Apple  may bring us closer to the answer. Until then, the focus should be on speeding up these investigations, which can already be done through the broader use of interim measures while anticipating more fundamental institutional changes. However, the balance of the evidence does not currently favor structural separation, and it is difficult to see how this would change in the future given the various procompetitive efficiencies of vertical integration. While such efficiencies exist, however, there is no guarantee whatsoever that they in every case outweigh the anticompetitive effects, which are particularly pronounced in platform markets. Therefore, there appears to be room for a behavioral measure that preserves those efficiencies while also providing a basis for intervention whenever the anticompetitive effects take the upper hand. However, a number of antitrust precedents (e.g. potential decisions on Amazon and Apple, in addition to the Google Search decision) could\u2014through increased deterrence\u2014have the same effect as a behavioral ex ante rule. Moreover, as anticompetitive effects are difficult to assess in discrimination scenarios (given that they involve innovation, quality and choice rather than price), mitigating the burden of proof on the complainant is advised. Again, however, this can be done through an evolving interpretation of ex post antitrust law as well as the adoption of an ex ante behavioral rule.

Consumers receive substantial benefits by receiving free or nominally free services. Because of the proliferation of search services like Google, consumers have more access to information at their fingertips than any point in human history. Likewise, because of the advances pioneered by Amazon, consumers have almost an unlimited array of choices when purchasing goods. Even if these corporations have monopolistic power, a monopoly by efficiency in producing and marketing better and cheaper product than other companies does not fall within the scope of the antitrust acts. 121 Breaking up the big tech giants would lessen innovation and is counter to the current approach of antitrust law, which considers the benefit to consumers.", "Proponents of breaking up Big Tech contend the consumer welfare standard should apply because the tech giants present a future threat to consumers and small businesses. However, the consumer benefit standard looks at what is benefitting or not benefitting consumers at the time of the analysis. 12 2 Declaring a company a threat to consumers in the future is not sufficient to bring an antitrust action. 123 A reduction of competition does not invoke the Sherman Act until it harms consumer welfare. 124 By breaking up internet companies because of their sheer size, the U.S. would be limiting the amount of innovation that could be produced. Goldman Sachs keeps an index tracking tech industry spending and the June 2018 spending levels are the third highest since Goldman Sachs created the index in 2002.125 This investment is primarily targeted at security software, software as a service applications, analytics, and private and public clouds.1 2 6 Apple, Amazon, and Google have spent a combined $80 billion on physical assets alone such as real estate, powerful computers, and undersea internet cables. 127 These investments benefit the economy and help drive the pace of innovation. Because of these innovations and investment, the tech giants added more market capitalization than the GDP of India since 2008.128 Even the U.S. government is dependent on the benefits of these industries.

ANALYSIS", "A. Monopoly", "Monopoly power is defined as \"power to control prices or exclude competition; existence of monopoly power may be inferred from predominate share of relevant market.\" 66 A monopoly has two elements, \"the (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\" 67 However, size itself does not make a corporation a monopoly. 68 Size may be considered in \"connection with other evidence bearing upon alleged monopolistic practices.\" 69 Simply earning massive profits or commanding a large portion of the market share is not enough to sustain an antitrust action. Although the existence of monopoly power may be inferred from predominant share of market, monopoly from market does not have to follow automatically, and only careful factual analysis of market in question will reveal whether monopoly power exists. 70 Only an overwhelming market share can qualify a corporation as a monopoly that requires breaking up. Even then, a careful analysis of the market must be done to determine if the corporation constitutes a monopoly.", "Generally, courts look to examine whether a company controls more than half the market. United States v. Grinnell states that a company controlling more than 87 percent of relevant market justifies the finding of a monopoly.7 1 Other courts require that a 75 to 80 percent market share is required to successfully prove monopolization under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.7 2 Thus, an overwhelming share of the market is required to sustain an antitrust action. However, each tech company does not control enough of the market to be considered a monopoly. Facebook and Google combined to account for 70 percent of internet traffic.73 Amazon may account for 49.1 percent of all online sales7 4 , but 90 percent of sales occur offline.7 5", "A court may consider other factors tending to show monopoly power, \"including the strength of competition, probable development of industry, barriers to entry, nature of anti-competitive conduct, and elasticity of consumer demand.\" 76 However, a corporation does not violate antitrust laws when its dominant position is secured by offering a better product and customer service.7 7 The tech giants' position in the market is the result of superior products. It is undeniable that Amazon's or Google's positions are not the result of superior products and business acumen. Amazon has surged past other e-commerce sites for its breadth of products that it offers and its convenient services, like Amazon Prime. Likewise, Google usurped Yahoo to become the world's largest search engine because of its refined and improved search algorithms. Google did not become and has not maintained its position as the world's largest search engine by buying up other search engines. Facebook did not become the dominant social network by fixing prices or controlling the supply. Facebook cannot control the supply because much of the supply is manufactured and sold by competing businesses.", "It also cannot be said that the tech giants have become dominant because of price fixing or other predatory conduct. The FTC investigated whether Google's search results were unfairly biased toward favoring its own products.7 8 In 2013, the FTC closed its investigation unanimously concluding that Google's conduct did not violate antitrust laws.79 Rather, the big four tech companies have poured money into research and development and have benefitted from it. Without a superior product and demand for that product, these companies would not hold the dominant position they do. Thus, the result of their dominant market position is the result of a superior product.

Much of the arguments against these tech giants are because these companies have record profits. As stated by the Supreme Court in Spectrum Sports, the purpose of antitrust laws is to protect the public from market failure, not to punish businesses because of their size and influence. 82 Arguments focusing on these elements miss the mark of the intent of antitrust legislation. Both possession of monopoly power and willful misuse are necessary to sustain a charge of illegal monopolization under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 83 Antitrust law is designed to protect consumers and prevent a market failure from companies fixing prices or controlling the supply chain, not to break up a business because of its size or profits. At this point, there is no reason to conclude that the market is failing consumers. There are no legitimate grounds with which to sustain charges of illegal monopolization.

Biden's remarks at the White House came after he traveled to Capitol Hill to make the case to House Democrats for the still-robust domestic package \u2014 $1.75 trillion of social services and climate change programs \u2014 that the White House believes can pass the 50-50 Senate. \u201cIt will fundamentally change the lives of millions of people for the better,\u201d Biden said of the agreement, which he badly wanted before the summits to show the world American democracy still works. \u201cLet's get this done.\u201d Together with a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill heading for final votes possibly as soon as Thursday, Biden claimed it would be a domestic achievement modeled on those of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. \u201cI need your votes,\u201d Biden told the lawmakers earlier, according to a person who requested anonymity to discuss the private remarks. Biden was eager to have a deal in hand before departing for the global summits. But final votes are still a ways off. At best, he left with a revised package that has lost some top priorities, frustrating many Democrats still pressing to include them as the president\u2019s ambitions make way for the political realities of the narrowly divided Congress. Paid family leave and efforts to lower prescription drug pricing are now gone entirely from the package, drawing outrage from some lawmakers and advocates. Still in the mix, a long list of other priorities: Free prekindergarten for all youngsters, expanded health care programs \u2014 including the launch of a new $35 billion hearing aid benefit for people with Medicare \u2014 and $555 billion to tackle climate change. There's also a one-year extension of a child care tax credit that was put in place during the COVID-19 rescue and new child care subsidies. An additional $100 billion to bolster the immigration and border processing system could boost the overall package to $1.85 trillion if it clears Senate rules. One pivotal Democratic holdout, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, said, \u201cI look forward to getting this done.\u201d However, another, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was less committal: \u201cThis is all in the hands of the House right now.\" The two Democrats have almost single-handedly reduced the size and scope of their party\u2019s big vision. Republicans remain overwhelmingly opposed. Taking form after months of negotiations, Biden's emerging bill would still be among the most sweeping of its kind in a generation, modeled on New Deal and Great Society programs. The White House calls it the largest-ever investment in climate change and the biggest improvement to the nation\u2019s healthcare system in more than a decade. In his meeting with lawmakers at the Capitol, Biden made clear how important it was to show progress as he headed to the summits. \u201cWe are at an inflection point,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the world wonders whether we can function.\u201d"], "id": "46358863f3cecb33efb13b262da6edada8ac250752a48804fc9b0fdbce3a7ddd", "highlighted_text": " Biden declared he had reached a \u201chistoric economic framework\u201d with Democrats the still-robust domestic package the White House believes can pass the 50-50 Senate it would be a domestic achievement modeled on Roosevelt and Johnson votes are still a ways off Still in the mix 555 billion to tackle climate change I look forward to getting this done The White House calls it the largest-ever investment in climate change We are at an inflection point", "highlights": [[3, 27, 41], [3, 51, 112], [3, 384, 387], [3, 388, 400], [3, 401, 417], [3, 489, 517], [3, 518, 539], [3, 897, 942], [3, 961, 974], [3, 982, 989], [3, 1214, 1231], [3, 1232, 1236], [3, 1237, 1240], [3, 1631, 1647], [3, 1849, 1885], [3, 2258, 2293], [3, 2740, 2810], [3, 3027, 3056]], "underlines": [[3, 27, 41], [3, 42, 50], [3, 51, 112], [3, 113, 124], [3, 166, 213], [3, 384, 387], [3, 388, 400], [3, 401, 417], [3, 489, 517], [3, 518, 539], [3, 542, 630], [3, 763, 828], [3, 897, 942], [3, 943, 960], [3, 961, 974], [3, 975, 981], [3, 982, 989], [3, 989, 990], [3, 990, 990], [3, 1124, 1213], [3, 1214, 1231], [3, 1232, 1236], [3, 1237, 1240], [3, 1240, 1241], [3, 1631, 1647], [3, 1849, 1885], [3, 2232, 2238], [3, 2251, 2258], [3, 2258, 2293], [3, 2318, 2325], [3, 2344, 2412], [3, 2602, 2690], [3, 2740, 2810], [3, 3026, 3027], [3, 3027, 3056], [3, 3056, 3069], [3, 3069, 3124]], "emphasis": [[3, 388, 400], [3, 518, 539], [3, 1214, 1231], [3, 1232, 1236], [3, 1237, 1240], [3, 1849, 1885], [3, 3069, 3124]], "cite_emphasis": [[0, 16]], "filename": "neg-6.docx", "division": "local", "year": "local", "school": "Local", "team": "Local", "download_url": "local", "cite_date": "2021-10-28"}, {"tag": "The newest reconciliation proposal overcomes Dem holdouts and passes now.", "cite": "McPherson \u201810/28 [Lindsey; 10/28/21; \u201cBiden makes $1.75T sales pitch to House Democrats\u201d; ; Roll Call; accessed 10/29/21; TV]", "body": ["President Joe Biden presented House Democrats with a $1.75 trillion reconciliation framework Thursday morning, which senior administration officials said he'll ask them to support when it\u2019s written and ready for a vote, along with a separate Senate-passed bipartisan infrastructure bill.", "The reconciliation bill would be fully paid for and potentially reduce the deficit, based on $2 trillion worth of offsets the president has identified.

The reasoning behind this is straightforward: Since presidents have only few tools at hand to sway lawmakers on how they cast their ballot, the focus of the White House is set at an earlier stage: by already influencing what is considered in the first place. Compared with the legislative prevalence of executives in parliamentarian democracies, presidents in the United States are clearly less able to dominate the agenda space. Yet based on his constitutional right to recommend legislation deemed necessary and appropriate (Art. II, Sec 3, U.S. Constitution), it is primarily the resources of the executive branch - i.e., the departmental bureaucracies, and the Executive Office of the President - which put the president into the position to exert policy leadership via drafting legislative proposals.", "Unmatched by any other single legislators or even Congress as a whole, John W. Kingdon is right to argue that \u201c[\u2026] no other single actor in the political system has quite the capability of the president to set agendas.\u201c (Kingdon 2003, 24). Previous research has shown that defining the agenda is a promising strategy for the White House. Presidential initiatives, both major and minor ones, almost always find their way into the legislative hopper (Cameron and Park 2008, 51f; Cohen 2012, 24ff; Edwards and Barrett 2000, 116ff). Accordingly, legislation proposed by the administration makes up between 30% and 50% of the congressional calendar, while the remaining proportion is initiated by members of Congress, is based on recurring pieces of legislation, and are reaction to external events or imminent crises (Edwards and Barrett 2000, 112ff; Taylor 1998, 377ff; Theriault 2002). While this indeed makes the president the single most important agenda-setter, it also demonstrates that he does not dominate the legislative agenda of Congress (Sinclair 2006, 255\u201363).", "We can mainly identify three mechanisms how presidential agenda-setting affects the lawmaking process in Congress. First, it enables the president to define the boundaries of policies under consideration, and in this way to structure the following deliberation. In this sense, agenda setting is first and foremost about obtaining the Deutungshoheit - i.e., the prerogative of interpretation - over the policy debate through setting the terms of the debate, moving first on certain policy aspects, and via framing and priming of core arguments (Edwards and Wood 1999; Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake 2005). George W. Bush, for instance, during his 2000 presidential campaign advertised his plans for massive across the board tax breaks which, at that time, were perceived as a mere \u201cpipe dream\u201d on both sides of the political spectrum (Milbank 2001). Cutting taxes, and especially to this extent, did not rank high among the priorities of lawmakers nor the American public. The arrival of Bush in the White House, however, completely changed the dynamics of debate. It put the tax cut proposal upfront of the legislative agenda during his first half year as president, and Democrats in the end had to accept an amount of tax breaks which came up to more than double of what they called reasonable six months before during the election campaign. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, was largely rolled by the issue dynamics in the debates regarding the overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service in 1997. Favoring only minor reforms, he had to concede early on to pressures from the public and Congress who, fueled by several major scandals, thirsted for a largescale reorganization of the IRS instead of a fine-tuning approach preferred by Clinton (Broder 1997). Of course, these are only two illustrations highlighting how presidents can succeed but also fail in setting the tone of the debate from early stages and through this pre-structure the outcome of the lawmaking process.", "Second, presidential leadership at the agenda-setting stage helps to overcome collective action problems within Congress and among its 535 legislators by providing a focal point around which other political actors\u2019 policy positions can crystalize (Cameron and Park 2008; Cohen 2012; Neustadt 1991, 8f). The USA PATRIOT Act can serve as a prime example in this regard, on which the New York Times stressed that \u201c[b]y and large, the House and Senate bills both use as a starting point a proposal sent to Capitol Hill nearly two weeks ago by the White House.\u201d (Lewis and Pear 2001). Since lawmakers in Congress today only have scarce resources to draft their own bills, presidential input from the beginning is often highly appreciated. Yet, a proposal from the White House furthermore fulfills the role of first mover draft upon which the subsequent debate can be structured. In this sense, it both offers a distinct policy outline upfront and provides guiding posts for the further deliberation process.", "Third, agenda-setting offers the White House the opportunity to highlight its priorities, how they are distributed across various policy issues, and in which way policies should be packaged (Rudalevige 2005, 437ff; Wayne 2009b, 317ff). Because the resources of any administration to lobby Congress are not infinite and the multiple political arenas are usually heavily crowded with myriad policy items and problems striving to be solved, the White House needs to prioritize its policy agenda. This involves, among other things, to select some issues over others, decide about their sequencing, how to pursue them, and how much political capital it wants or needs to spend on any given item. Therefore, the administration will focus on certain policies with more attention, on others with less, depending on the prioritization by the president but also upon other considerations, such as the overall density of the policy agenda or imminent pressures of the time. The trick is to not overwhelm Congress with the president\u2019s initiatives. As Lyndon B. Johnson famously quipped, \u201cCongress is like a Whiskey drinker. You can put an awful lot of whiskey into a man if you just let him sip it. But if you try to force the whole bottle down his throat at one time, he\u2019ll throw it up.\u201d (cited in Rudalevige 2002, 113). Thus, the failure to prioritize easily leads to overload of Pennsylvania Avenue with Congress at the one end, and to excessive demands and exhaustion for the White House at the other end. The rocky start of the Clinton administration underlines this argument: since the White House did not pursue a \u2018rifle-approach\u2019 to define clear policy priorities for its initial months and then execute them, it got lost in numerous legislative battles and mine-fields early on in its first year. Instead it followed a \u2018shotgun-approach\u2019 by addressing as many issues as possible at once leading to an overkill and chaos (Rockman 1996; Sinclair 2000b)."], "id": "7d4c2a55488056292e1cc127bd20ec5822a897f6c543f7c343f1763c9475d99d", "highlighted_text": " Since presidents have only few tools to sway lawmakers the focus is set at an earlier stage by already influencing what is considered this makes the president the single most important agenda-setter it also does not dominate presidential agenda-setting enables the president to define policies under consideration presidential leadership helps to overcome collective action problems by providing a focal point Because the resources of any administration are not infinite and arenas are crowded with myriad policy items the White House needs to prioritize its agenda.

The number of new pandemic cases spiked to a record high last week. The fight against COVID-19 will require the expenditure of time, energy and political capital that the new president will require to solve other problems. The recession was a direct consequence of Trump\u2019s failure to effectively fight COVID-19. Even if the pandemic dissipates, the new president will still have to aggressively tackle the economic problems that confront the nation. Millions of people lost their jobs during the pandemic and many of them won\u2019t have jobs to return to when and if the pandemic finally subsides. Biden outlined his priorities recently in an interview with the podcast Pod Save America, \u201cGet control of the coronavirus. Without that nothing else will work well. Number one. Number two, invest in the community, in real infrastructure.\u201d Biden\u2019s priorities in the first chapter of his presidency are key because history has demonstrated that the major energy in a presidency comes early and dwindles as time goes on. But other urgent problems face Trump\u2019s successor. The concern about the pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn has driven dangers of climate change off the stage. The threat of climate change won\u2019t disappear just because politicians didn\u2019t discuss it as much during the campaign. If a President Biden doesn\u2019t put the fight against climate change on top of his to-do list, he will run into trouble with progressive members of his own party like Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.), who have championed the Green New Deal. The death and disease created by COVID-19 have intensified the need for a complete overhaul of the nation\u2019s health care system. The pandemic and the subsequent economic carnage have crowded other issues like the toxic racial climate, a broken health care system and the violent gun culture off the stage but the new president must deal with them anyway. Biden will need to actively confront several major problems when most presidents are lucky to mount one serious initiative during the first year of his presidency. There will be big institutional obstacles that could tie Biden\u2019s hands even as the United States faces crises of epic proportions. Currently, Republicans have a two-seat advantage in the U.S. Senate. All eyes turn to Georgia where there will be two runoff elections for the upper chamber in January. Unless Democrats sweep the double header in the Peach Tree State, Biden will have to grapple with a Senate controlled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). If Biden is successful pushing significant legislation through Congress, the Supreme Court conservative majority, aided by the elevation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, could wipe out significant legislative victories. Biden could win a fight to extend the reach of the Affordable Care Act to millions of more Americans only to see the high court abolish the whole program. Any attempt by the high court to curtail a women\u2019s right to choose by nullifying Roe v. Wade would put abortion on top of Biden\u2019s crowded issue agenda and place pressure from him to increase the number of justices. Biden will have his work cut out for him.
