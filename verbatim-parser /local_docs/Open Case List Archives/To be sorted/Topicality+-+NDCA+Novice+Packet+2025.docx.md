# Topicality

### File Explanation

Topicality is an argument that sets limits on what should be the focus
of debates. Each year, the community votes on a resolution to debate.
This year's resolution is:

**The United States federal government should significantly increase its
exploration and/or development of the Arctic.**

The purpose of topicality is to make sure that both sides are prepared
to debate the topic. Debates would not be very good if the affirmative
decided to not talk about the Arctic at all, and instead read an
affirmative on last year's topic about intellectual property. If a team
did that, they would very likely lose because the negative would
correctly argue that they are not topical (meaning, they don't fall
within the scope of the resolution above).

There's a novice packet, so everyone is prepared. Nonetheless, learning
how to debate topicality is still very important. There are
disagreements over what the words of the resolution mean, and both the
affirmative and negative might have different understandings of key
terms. For example, if you thought that "development" meant teams had to
drill the Arctic, but your opponents thought that "development" instead
meant that teams had to fund health and wellness initiatives in the
Arctic, there would be a disparity in preparedness.

Debating topicality is about interpreting select terms in the resolution
and then explaining why your interpretation creates the best debates
over the course of this year.

There are two arguments that the negative can read in this file:

#### Topicality -- Its

[This argument really only applies to the Russia LNG
affirmative]{.underline}.

The argument is that the word "its" in the resolution means "federal"
(because it refers back to the federal government). That means
affirmatives would be limited solely to affirmatives about
federally-controlled exploration or development. The Russia LNG
affirmative is mostly about having the federal government approve
private development of the Russian Arctic. So, debatably, the
development that would occur is not "federal" but instead it's private.

I turned out affirmative answers for three affirmatives, even though
this violation only really applies to Russia LNG. The other two
affirmatives -- Native Renewables and Science Diplomacy -- do not
violate this interpretation of its, because they are about federally
controlled exploration and development. But I turned out affirmative
blocks anyway because it's possible a negative team could read this in
those debates. Affirmative teams should primarily extend the "we meet"
argument, because there is no violation.

#### Topicality -- minerals

[This argument applies to Science Diplomacy, Domain Awareness, and
Native Renewables, but not to Russian LNG]{.underline}.

The argument is that the words "exploration" and "development" mean
looking for, and drilling minerals (which include oil and gas). The
three affirmatives violate this interpretation, because they have
nothing to do with minerals extraction.

#### Debating topicality

The negative is usually successful going for topicality if they can
convince the judge that the affirmative interpretation of the topic is
very broad and allows too many cases for the negative to prepare for.
Affirmatives can be successful by arguing that the negative's
interpretation of the topic is not predictable (for example, it's not
about the Arctic), or that it limits the topic too much and makes it too
hard to be affirmative.

One argument in some of the 2AC blocks is the argument that "other words
prevent a limits explosion". This argument defines a
[different]{.underline} term in the resolution, to allow the affirmative
to say that a broad interpretation of one word does not mean their
overall interpretation of the topic is broad. For example, even if
"exploration" and "development" are very broad terms, the word "its" is
a strict limit on what the affirmative can do if "its" means it must be
federally controlled. Why? Because the vast majority of exploration and
development is carried out by private actors. The federal government
isn't the party that drills for oil -- it's ExxonMobile. Likewise, a
very broad interpretation of "its" might be justifiable if "exploration"
and "development" are both very narrow (such as being limited to
minerals development).

## Topicality - Its

### 1NC -- Topicality "Its"

#### A. Interpretation. "Its" refers to [federal]{.underline} exploration or development -- the federal government must control the action

**King**, 20**19** - Presiding Justice, for the Supreme Court of
Mississippi, dissenting. Araujo v. Bryant, 283 So. 3d 73, 79-80, 2019

Uni, Accessed via University of Michigan //DH

P52. \"Any county or separate school district may levy an additional
tax, as prescribed by general law, to maintain its schools.\"6 Miss.
Const. art. 8, § 206 (emphasis added). [[\"Its\" is a possessive
pronoun]{.mark}]{.underline} that modifies and qualifies the noun
\"schools.\" William Strunk, Jr. & \[\*\*33\] E.B. White, The Elements
of Style, at 12 (4th ed. 2014); The Chicago Manual of Style 5.49 (17th

Possessive pronouns are \"used as limiting adjectives to qualify

\"Possessive\" is defined as \"\[t\]he case of nouns that indicates

conclusion that \"[its schools]{.mark}\"]{.underline} in Article 8,
Section 206, [[refers to schools]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} county or
school [district]{.mark}]{.underline} possesses,
[[controls]{.underline}]{.mark}, and/[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[owns]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### B. Violation. The plan authorizes [private]{.underline} development by allowing US companies to invest in Russian LNG. It does not mean the [federal]{.underline} government is doing the development

#### C. Prefer our interpretation. It's vital to limiting the topic by preventing affirmatives that allow [other]{.underline} people to explore or develop the Arctic -- that opens the topic to include all private companies, non-governmental organizations, and individuals

#### D. Topicality is a [voting issue]{.underline} for fairness and education. 

### They Say: "We Meet: Federal permits"

#### The plan's an [incentive]{.underline} for private development. Federal participation doesn't make it federal because after permission is granted, [companies]{.underline} have control

//DH

Conclusion. As the USPS has emphasized, the ubiquitous
[[actions]{.mark}]{.underline} and inactions [[of federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[affect the
likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of private
undertakings]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as their benefits and
burdens, in innumerable ways. In this context[[, it would make no sense
to require federal agencies to assess the]{.underline}]{.mark}
environmental [[impact of private actions **over which they have no
control**]{.underline}]{.mark}, solely on the basis of the incidental
effects of federal action on the private action. Fortunately, there is
no indication that in enacting NEPA Congress intended to do so.

[[In this case, the USPS has participated]{.mark}, on an arms-length
basis, [in a **private development**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Factually,
its actions were merely incidental to the private development and,
legally, the development has been insulated from USPS control.
Accordingly, this Court holds \"reasonable under the circumstances\" the
USPS\'s implicit determination that the environmental impact of the
Project as a whole did not have to be considered in the environmental
assessment underlying the FONSI.

#### Permitting doesn't make it federal. The permit creates private development [by effect]{.underline}

were cited]{.underline} by the EPA as support [for]{.underline} its
objections to [the]{.underline} Corps\' [proposed scope of]{.underline}
analysis [regulations]{.underline} in 1984. In the former case, a
developer planning a 156-acre residential and commercial development
applied for a Corps permit to stabilize an adjacent river bank, which
was necessary for the development to proceed. The court there required
the private development to be evaluated in the NEPA document as a likely
occurrence resulting from the issuance of a permit. See, generally, 605
F. Supp. at 1428-1434. The latter involved the proposed construction of
a causeway from the mainland to an island, and required the NEPA
analysis to include among the effects of permit issuance the industrial
development on the island that would be stimulated by construction of
the causeway. 769 F.2d at 877-78. As noted by the Corps in its response
to EPA\'s objections:

[[These cases did not hold]{.underline}]{.mark} the Corps [[permits
\"federalized\" the]{.underline}]{.mark} unregulated [[private
development]{.mark} so as [to render]{.mark} the [private action
Federal]{.mark}]{.underline} actions for NEPA purposes. Rather, among
the numerous legal problems found by each court, [[the cases required
the Corps to consider the private development likely to occur **as a
result of** the]{.underline}]{.mark} issuance of the Corps
[[permit.]{.underline}]{.mark} Such analysis is part of an accepted NEPA
requirement to consider the environmental effects of Federal action . .

Cf. Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Flowers, 359 F.3d 1257, 1272 n.15
(10th Cir. 2004): The appeals court observed that the distinction made
in the NEPA/404 scope of analysis between the impacts of permitted
discharges and those of independent upland developments (as set forth in
Wetlands Action Network and Sylvester) does not properly apply to the
alternatives analysis under Section 404. In this case, the court
observed that, although portions of the subject residential and golf
development located on uplands were arguably independent of the portions
for which a Section 404 permit was required, the Corps\' 404(b)(1)
analysis properly took into account the impact of the development as a
whole on bald eagle nesting and foraging habitat, including upland
areas, because that habitat is part of the overall \"aquatic
ecosystem,\" which must be considered under the 404(b)(1) Guidelines.

## Topicality -- Minerals

### 1NC -- Topicality "Minerals"

#### A. Interpretation. Exploration and development are the processes of searching for and exploiting [minerals]{.underline}, including oil and gas. This is defined by [federal law]{.underline}

Offshore Methane Hydrates: Existing Laws and Conventions," 32 Pace

2\. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)

OCSLA would regulate those methane hydrates within U.S. territorial
waters. The OCSLA provides for the recognition of the mineral assets of
the U.S. offshore in its territorial and EEZ waters. It also provides
the regulatory framework to lease those minerals.

The onset of methane hydrate development is also limited by previous
efforts to prevent offshore development of oil and gas within the U.S. A
variety of specific statutes banning offshore developments, e.g. the
North Carolina Outer Banks Protection Act, and presidential executive
moratoria have either directly prevented the leasing of areas offshore
both the West and East Coasts or have prevented budget allocations from
supporting the administrative costs of that licensing. Today, only the
areas offshore Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas are active in development
activities. 705

a\. Applicability to Offshore Methane Hydrates

[[OCSLA defines minerals to include]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[gas]{.underline}]{.mark}, 706
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[methane hydrates]{.underline}.]{.mark}
707 Likewise, [[OCSLA includes minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}, \[\*907\]

\"[[exploration]{.mark},\"]{.underline} 709
[\"[development]{.mark},\"]{.underline} 710 \"production,\" 711 and
\"fair market value.\" 712 As such, OCSLA provides the legal foundations
for leasing and economically managing methane hydrates within the
U.S.\'s EEZ.

What might not be expected though, is that OCSLA provides to the
Secretary of Commerce, not the Department of the Interior or the EPA,
the duties to perform EAs on prospective and on-going methane hydrate
leases and operations. 713 Nevertheless, NEPA remains in application, as
it applies to all federal agencies. 714

### They Say: "Predictability"

#### There is no Arctic-specific definition of development

//DH

**Penikett = Tony Penikett, former Premier of Yukon Territories.**

Define sustainable development?

\- Eventually, [[this knowledge database could
create]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary [[indicators on how to define
so-called sustainable Arctic development]{.underline}]{.mark}, said
Penikett. Although a remarkable popular term in Arctic discussions,
"sustainable [[development" lacks a clear definition of what both
"sustainable" and "development" actually entails in a northern
context]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Accordingly, Tony Penikett called out for young and aspiring
PhD-students or other academics to initiate his project idea.

\- It could start with a pilot project for a single country, linked to
the work already done across the universities in the Arctic. Given the
relevance of this initial work, it could be expanded across the
circumpolar region, Penikett added.

#### It's inherently unpredictable, we need to draw the line somewhere

The term [[development has no precise meaning]{.mark} and accepted
definition]{.underline}. Hoggart and Buller (1987, 18) noted that
"[[when commentators]{.underline}]{.mark} speak or [[write about
development, they]{.underline}]{.mark} frequently [[mean very different
things]{.mark} ... what development actually is, is a personal
evaluation\".]{.underline} Similarly, Black (1991) indicated that
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark} is a user-friendly term and therefore
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} virtually [[as many potential meanings as
potential users.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Development is narrowly perceived by some as economic growth. Todaro
(1989) for example, indicated that development means the capacity of a
region to generate and sustain an annual increase in its Gross National
Product (GNP) at a rate of more than 5 percent. This definition equates
development with increase in GNP. Apart from economic growth,
development also involves other aspects of human life (Lele 1975). It
includes positive changes in the demographic, social, and political
characteristics of a society or region. For example, among others, a
region or country experiencing development would experience improvements
in health, education and housing, changes that may be partly attributed
to economic growth but development is a multi-dimensional process of
societal change. These changes usually occur over a period of time.

### They Say: Minerals Definition is Colonialist

#### Minerals development can benefit Alaskan Natives

Bill M**atlack,** 20**24** - "Biden Hurts Native Groups With Alaska
Mining Limits; And green energy priorities, too. He instead leaves
critical resource extraction in foreign powers\' hands." Wall Street
Journal, 4/24, Proquest //DH

As a young geologist in 1979, I explored Red Dog, then an undrilled
outcropping of zinc and lead mineralization in the western Brooks Range
of Alaska. At the Ambler District 150 miles to the southeast, large
deposits rich in copper, zinc and cobalt had already been discovered and
drilled. Today, [[Red Dog is the world\'s largest zinc mine and a
**powerful economic driver** for]{.underline}
[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Native groups.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Meanwhile, little has changed in the Ambler District, a legacy President
Biden appears intent to continue by canceling plans to build an access
road (\" Biden Piles Sanctions on Alaska ,\" Review & Outlook, April
20).

Red Dog is scheduled to close in 2031 when its reserves are depleted.
This reflects a larger trend, as [[Alaska\'s Native groups face a fiscal
cliff from declining oil, gas and mineral production
revenue]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Ambler District would be an
important contributor to their **economic
prosperity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Candidate Biden told us he would make critical metals a priority for his
green initiative. Not to worry, he said, raw materials would be sourced
from mines overseas and used to create high-paying, value-added
manufacturing jobs in the U.S. This assumes the foreign countries
producing these metals play along, a prospect that seems increasingly
unlikely.

China controls the global supply chains of cobalt, rare earths,
germanium and gallium. Chile recently announced plans to nationalize its
lithium industry. Indonesia has curbed unrefined nickel and copper
exports to control their supply chains.

As noted above, under NEPA, federal agencies are only required to
prepare an EIS for "major federal actions significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." For the purposes of NEPA[, [federal
actions include "projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and programs [entirely or
partly financed]{.underline}, assisted, conducted, regulated,
[or]{.underline} [[**approved by** Federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}."121 Thus, where a federal agency proposes
to undertake a soil amendment project, that would qualify as a "federal
action" under NEPA. Soil amendment [projects proposed by non-federal
actors (e.g., private individuals]{.underline} or companies) might also
[qualify if the projects are funded, approved, or otherwise regulated by
a federal agency]{.underline}. In the latter case, however, [the project
will only be considered a federal action]{.underline} under NEPA [if it
is "subject to Federal control and responsibility]{.underline}."122 As
discussed in Part 4.1.4 below, [[many privately

P21. At the outset of our analysis, we note our disagreement with the

Article 8, Section 206. Miss. Const. art. 8, § 206. While \"its\" is a
possessive-case pronoun that refers to the antecedent \"county or

#### Federal [approval]{.underline} makes a project federal, even if carried out by private parties

Climate Change Law, "Permitting CO2 Pipelines" (Sept. 2023). Available
at: https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/207 //DH

Permitting decisions by the Army Corps of Engineers under either CWA or
the Rivers and Harbors Act are themselves subject to environmental
review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA mandates
preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any "major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment."184 "[Major [Federal actions" include "projects]{.mark} and
programs entirely or partly financed]{.underline}, assisted, conducted,
regulated, [or [approved by federal agencies," **even if those projects
are primarily conducted by private parties**]{.mark}]{.underline}.185
NEPA requires the Army Corps of Engineers to review the environmental
impact of its permits under CWA and the Rivers and Harbors Act, but
other actions by federal agencies may also trigger NEPA review. While
actions by CO2 pipeline regulators that do not issue discretionary
permits, like PHMSA, will not implicate NEPA,186 more discretionary
functions, like BLM's issuance of pipeline rights-of-way, often will.187
However, "NEPA is a procedural statute only; it makes no substantive
demands on the federal agencies" and "mandates no particular result from
the consideration of environmental impacts, but only that those impacts
be identified and considered."188

International Collaboration in the Arctic

The Arctic research community has long been a beacon and a bastion of
international collaborations. International partnerships with European
and Asian partners greatly advanced our understanding of the role of the
Arctic in the global climate system. Such cooperation promotes more
rapid learning and more efficient achievements.

[Following Russia\'s]{.underline} further [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in February, [[the U.S. ceased
**gov**]{.mark}ernment**[-to-gov]{.mark}**ernment]{.underline} and
multilateral [[engagement with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that was not
in the U.S. national security interest. [[Research]{.mark} that has been
[disrupted]{.mark} [includes]{.mark} [field studies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural carbon emissions, [[permafrost]{.mark}
degradation]{.underline}, large river discharges, and population
dynamics of walrus, polar bears, and waterfowl. Since Russia decided to
escalate this brutal war, [[**Federal** scientists]{.mark} have [ceased
these partnerships]{.mark} and shelved plans for new joint
efforts]{.underline}. [We have had no choice but to forgo the regular
collegial communications that enriched our understanding of Arctic
science since the thawing of the Cold War]{.underline}.

Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has caused tremendous suffering
and a cascade of misery throughout Europe; the disruption of Arctic
science is but one negative outcome that is far outweighed by the loss
of life and threats to democracy. However, we must not ignore the impact
to science, and we remain hopeful that Russia will fully withdraw from
Ukraine and end this war. It was through scientific partnerships and
collaborations that the U.S. and Russia developed a more open working
relationship at various points in history. We remain hopeful that the
scientific friendships we developed in the past can one day pave the way
for mutual respect and cooperation in science and policy. It is for this
reason that I worry about proposals to erect barriers to future
scientific collaboration, such as a policy contained in Section 535 of
H.R. 8256, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2023, which would prohibit OSTP, NASA, and the
National Space Council from collaborating with Russia.

[The magnitude of the challenges associated with climate change in the
Arctic are simply too great for any nation to resolve in
isolation]{.underline}. [We must continue to collaborate]{.underline}
with our international partners, particularly [in field studies and
observations]{.underline}, but also by sharing results, accomplishments,
and understanding.

#### The plan only governs federally funded and controlled research

Mitch **Ambrose,** 20**22** -- Mitch manages AIP's science policy
newsletters and resources. He previously was a fellow at the Science and
Technology Policy Institute and worked for the Senate Commerce, Science,
and Transportation Committee. "US Restricts Science Collaborations with
Russia" American Institute of Physics, 6/17,

https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/us-restricts-science-collaborations-russia

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced on
June 11 that [[the U.S. will "wind down" research collaborations with
Russia]{.mark} in response to its invasion of Ukraine. [The policy
applies to **federally funded projects**]{.mark} involving research
institutions and individuals affiliated with the Russian
government]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it [permits non-government
organizations]{.mark} in the U.S. [to make their own decisions]{.mark}
on whether to continue collaborations]{.underline}.

The announcement arrived just before OSTP Acting Director Alondra Nelson
participated in a summit of science ministers from the G7 countries,
comprising the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada. In
a joint statement, the ministers declared their commitment to
restricting government-funded research projects involving participation
by the Russian government, though they left the door open for engagement
with individual scientists.

"In the spirit of science diplomacy, we will continue the dialogue
between civil societies, including exchanges with Russian scientists and
students to the furthest extent possible, especially through the
promotion of individual academic and student mobility," they wrote.

US follows Europe in cutting official science ties

While the U.S. was quick to implement sweeping economic sanctions and
technology export controls on Russia, the White House had until now been
silent on whether it would pause or sever scientific ties between the
countries. By contrast, many European countries moved quickly to impose
official restrictions on science collaborations.

OSTP and the State Department declined requests for interviews about the
new U.S. policy but provided written responses to some questions.

Explaining why the U.S. chose to take an explicit stance on restricting
science collaborations, [a State Department spokesperson
stated]{.underline}, "Considering Russia's war crimes and other
atrocities committed by Russia's forces in Ukraine, [we recognize the
importance that we make clear what our research policy is to those who
are ultimately responsible for implementing it.]{.underline}"

[[The policy applies to both federal agencies and organizations they
sponsor, such as **national labs**]{.mark}, and instructs such
organizations to contact their agency sponsor for further
guidance]{.underline}.

In general, the policy prohibits new projects in "affected subject
areas," but ones begun before the start of the invasion on Feb. 24 will
be allowed to continue to completion. [[Federal agencies
will]{.underline}]{.mark} also "[[curtail interaction" with]{.mark}
leaders of [institutions affiliated with the Russian
government]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as with "those who have publicly
expressed support for the invasion of Ukraine."

While the policy states the U.S. will limit engagement with Russia in
"various international projects and initiatives related to science and
technology," it indicates partnerships will continue in areas where
required by "international law."

An OSTP spokesperson identified the ITER fusion facility under
construction in France as an example of a multilateral project where the
U.S. is compelled to continue engagement with Russia, which is a
founding member of ITER.

"There is no provision for expulsion of a member state from the ITER
project," the spokesperson stated. "The U.S. is in close cooperation
with its European, Indian, Japanese, and Korean partners concerning
Russia's future participation. Fusion energy science, including our
continued membership in ITER, continues to be a priority for the
Biden-Harris administration."

The spokesperson also offered one example of the U.S. curtailing
interaction with Russia, pointing to its decision in March to freeze
participation in the Arctic Council, a forum currently chaired by Russia
that coordinates multilateral activities in the region, including
research. The spokesperson noted that on June 8 the U.S. and other
Arctic Council nations announced they would resume some projects so long
as they do not involve participation by the Russian government.

Vice tightening on collaborations with Russian scientists

Beyond ITER, the U.S. also has significant partnerships with Russia
through the CERN particle physics lab in Europe. Russia and the U.S. are
not CERN member states but both are among the largest contributors to
the facility, with more than 1,000 scientists affiliated with Russian
institutions currently involved in the lab's experimental program.

CERN began to suspend interactions with the Russian government in March,
while permitting scientists affiliated with Russian institutions to
continue working there. However, today CERN announced its intent to not
renew its cooperation agreement with Russia, which expires in December
2024, meaning scientists affiliated with Russian institutions will be
unable to work at CERN after that date. CERN also plans to not renew its
cooperation agreement with Belarus, which served as a staging ground for
Russia's invasion.

Confirming the decision's impact on scientists, a CERN spokesperson
stated, "They can continue their scientific work on current activities
until the expiry. If at that time their institutions are outside Russia
and Belarus, they may continue to work at CERN. The Council's decision
applies to the countries and their institutions, not to individuals."

One outstanding question is whether Russian scientists will be permitted
to participate in projects involving the Department of Energy's user
facilities, such as its X-ray and neutron sources, which are open to
scientists from around the world. Based on statistics compiled by DOE,
220 Russian scientists used the facilities in the fiscal year preceding
the pandemic. Two Russian nuclear science institutions are also partners
on the internationally administered Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment, which will be built in South Dakota.

OSTP deferred to individual science agencies for examples of projects
that will be affected by the new policy. A spokesperson for the DOE
Office of Science declined to comment, while a spokesperson for [[the
National Science Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} indicated the agency
[[is "unlikely to make new \[grant\] awards with Russian
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The spokesperson noted [NSF generally does not directly fund Russian
institutions but has a "handful" of grants to U.S. institutions with
subawards to Russian entities,]{.underline} often for field technicians.
"We encourage all researchers to consider whether this is the best time
for activity involving Russian collaboration or fieldwork, given the
current situation and risks associated with it. Researchers are
encouraged to consider whether their research objectives can be
accomplished through other means," the spokesperson stated.

[In NSF's grant database, a few dozen active projects reference Russia,
primarily in relation to Arctic research]{.underline}. The database
lists three grants where the primary recipient was a Russian
institution, all involving cases where NSF paid for a Russian icebreaker
to resupply McMurdo Station in Antarctica a handful of times prior to
2014.

In general, U.S. government collaboration with Russia chilled
significantly following its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with
a key exception being the continued joint operation of the International
Space Station, which is a legally binding partnership. Although Russian
space agency head Dmitry Rogozin has made some inflammatory statements
about the ISS partnership, it has to date weathered strain from the war.

[[**contemporary** efforts to explore the Arctic originate from
oil]{.mark} and gas [companies]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and
**scientists**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [who]{.underline} employ
different methods and techniques and [have different motives for
exploration]{.underline}. Consequently, [[as the "unknown" elements of
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved and
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark}, so has [[the "subject" of exploration
transformed as well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Previous explorations leading up to the twenty-first century certainly
increased the geopolitical importance of the Arctic, as nations
developed new fishing grounds and new shipping routes. Subsequent
colonization of parts of the Arctic (Russian rule in Alaska, the Hudson
Bay Company in Canada, and the Bergen Greenland Company of Norway and
Denmark) paved the way for additional economic activities, such as fur
trading (Norman, 2018: 2).

Early economic and scientific explorations were financed by states
primarily to promote their interests in expanding their reach in the
areas of the Arctic considered terra nullius. Since then, the increasing
pressure of globalization on the nation-state system in the twenty-first
century promoted new actors in Arctic exploration, such as IGOs
(intergovernmental organizations), NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), private companies and multinational investors. Indeed,
the term "explorer" today is largely used as a metaphor, since the type
of exploration has evolved from discovering unknown territory to
developing new economic activities, such as the exploration of oil and
gas deposits by companies. In such cases, the new explorers are
companies.

[[Climate change has become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[the most

The concepts "research" and "exploration" are often used
indiscriminately about scientific or science related activities in the
past. [[Though we might like to think of]{.underline}]{.mark} research
as systematic, scientific studies and [[exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather [[as]{.mark} the process of [discovering new
territories]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[it]{.mark} [is important to
interpret]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} two
[c[oncept]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[contemporary context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What we may regard
today as a pure discovery expedition might have been viewed in the past
as advanced science.

Polar research as a specific term probably originated in Germany in the
19th century -- "Polarforschung" became a scientific discipline. Today,
however, we realize that polar research is not defined as a particular
discipline but is a geographical definition: research that is dedicated
to polar areas of the world. Typically, it is field based,
multidisciplinary, international, and very expensive. It is also typical
that polar research is motivated by more than scientific curiosity --
individual and national prestige, economic and political interests are
also important. Nonetheless, international cooperation is prevalent in
polar research.

Karl Weyprecht and Georg von Neumayer's initiative in the 1870s to
organize the first International Polar Year (1882--83) was a turning
point in making polar research more focussed on science, less on heroic
exploration and discovery. On Svalbard the Swedes manned the IPY station
at Kapp Thordsen, with great success.

The [([scientific) exploration of Svalbard may be divided into different
phases]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example:

• 1596--[[1720: First discovery, geographical

• 1720--1850: Development of natural science, North Pole expeditions

//DH

Recently, the Arctic began to be treated as a "geopolitical hotspot" and
as a "resource frontier." The region's international (i.e., interstate)
dynamics has been drawing the attention of scholars and policymakers
seeking to make sense (and take advantage) of emerging geopolitical and
economic phenomena in the region. One of the main drivers of such
efforts is the so-called Arctic resource boom -- an enhanced knowledge
on the resource endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially in terms
of the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves. Since the
publication of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, such
knowledge of the region has only increased, and triggered a plethora of
economic development projects for the region -- most geared towards
making the commercial exploitation of such resources viable. Such plans,
typical of [neo-**[extractivist modes of
development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and capital accumulation,1) demand
new instruments and technologies of control over land, territory and
resources -- not only in enabling the resource exploitation, but also in
displacing Arctic Indigenous populations that inhabit spaces where
resource-based economic activity is meant to take place. This process
has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling space
and mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation
activities". 2)

Theorizations and debates on the Arctic resource boom or on the
geopolitical tensions rising in the region [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally [[oblivious to indigenous political
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, institutions and articulations in the
region[. This [erasure takes]{.mark} the [colonial violence]{.mark}
underlying the relation between Arctic States and Arctic indigenous
peoples [out of sight, obscuring the **violent history of
expropriation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[underpinning]{.mark}]{.underline}
contemporary Arctic geopolitics and economic
[[development]{.underline}.]{.mark} Another effect of such perspectives
is the presentation of the Arctic as an "empty" space, devoid of people,
social dynamics and politics other than those developed and brought by
Westphalian States.3) [This position seeks to **justify State
interventions**]{.underline} in the region [for]{.underline} "properly"
[seizing]{.underline} emerging [economic]{.underline} and strategic
[opportunities -- with]{.underline} little to [no regard for indigenous
cultures and subsistence in the Arctic]{.underline}, nor to the already
sensible effects of climate change in the region.

The present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new
wave of Arctic settler colonialism. We argue that, although [projects
for resource exploitation of the Arctic]{.underline} are achieving
unprecedented scale, they [represent a continuity of the colonial
project]{.underline}, benefitting from the way previous waves of
colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the relations
between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories. Our
discussion is focused on the impacts of colonialism over the Beringian
portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit homeland -- and the impacts of
colonialism over the relation between State, indigenous peoples and
Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a discussion of the Arctic resource
boom and the strategic and development projects emerging in the Arctic
policies of littoral states and their treatment of indigenous issues
amid economic and strategic pressures to carve out new extractive
enclaves in Arctic territories.

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to
understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American
populations and the importance of resource extraction shaped
contemporary Arctic spaces -- from baleen and whale oil to the gold rush
and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is to
understand how this first moment of colonialism set up the conditions
for modern-day resource development projects. The discussion, then,
turns to [contemporary economic development projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}, understanding them as neo-extractivist enterprises
-- i.e., enterprises that rely heavily on resource development and
control over space in a late capitalist globalized economy. As such,
these projects represent a geographical expansion of extractive
frontiers in a global scale, seeking new resource reserves and to
reshape space to make them commercially viable. This [represents a new
wave of colonialism]{.underline} -- i.e., of attempts by state and
capital to enhance control over traditional indigenous territories --
[and a new wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} from their rights to their traditional
lands and livelihoods.

Old colonialisms: the colonial encounter in Inuit Nunaat

'Government, as such, was introduced when the whaling fleet came to the
Beaufort Sea, when the trappers came to the Canadian Arctic, and when
the Danes came to Greenland. Behind them came the Christian
missionaries, and behind them came those who "governed" us.'4)

In the field of International Studies, [[analyses of
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitics and economic [[development tend
to overlook]{.mark} the process of transformation of the
Arctic]{.underline} in a series of discrete territorial jurisdictions --
[and [the colonial violence underpinning such process]{.mark}
is]{.underline} generally [absent]{.underline} from historical
narratives and theoretical reflections. Since mainstream theorizations
organize their gaze from the point of view of the State, subnational and
non-national, non-state political organizations are rendered invisible.
Therefore, the colonization of Inuit Nunaat -- and, in fact, [the
colonization of]{.underline} the traditional homelands of [many
indigenous peoples are excluded from]{.underline} theoretical efforts
and reflections developed within [international relations]{.underline}
in general. [The recent spike in [interest in Arctic issues has
**reproduced such erasures**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [thinking
through]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[narrow definitions]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitics and [economic
[development,]{.mark}]{.underline} [seeing such issues so long as they
represent]{.underline} problems and/or [opportunities for Arctic
States.]{.underline} This framework has rendered Arctic international
relations into discussions and theorizing of Arctic interstate
relations, [[excluding indigenous political organizations
from]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[debates.]{.underline}]{.mark} An
account of the colonial encounter in Arctic spaces, more than a mere
historical recapitulation of how States occupied and annexed Inuit
Nunaat into their sovereign jurisdictions, is also a necessary step in
comprehending and theorizing contemporary Arctic environmental,
geopolitical and economic issues.

//DH

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices; this is not the only
history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact Indigenous peoples in the
Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of resistance to and
struggle against colonialism. [[The Inuit Circumpolar
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is an institution born of such efforts and,
to this day, it [disputes the contents and objectives of Arctic policies
through the development of its own political instruments]{.underline}
and Arctic policies in many dimensions[. [Rejecting]{.underline}]{.mark}

autonomy, self-government and]{.underline} economic [[development
**other than those deployed by settler-colonial**]{.mark}, capitalist,
westphalian **[States]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Understanding colonialisms and their development is an important step in
reckoning with the colonial violence underlying present-day rationales
for dealing with geopolitical and economic issues in the Arctic. It is
important to know and tell the histories of struggle and resistance to
colonialism, but [it is]{.underline} [also important to understand how
[the understandings deployed by indigenous
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} and their social and political practice
**[[might inform future debates on Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
geopolitics and economic [**[development]{.underline}**.]{.mark} While
[[such struggles put in question the **Euro-American
definitions**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}, sovereignty and self-government,
they were also invested in the construction of alternative
understandings and alternative social practices. Unearthing such
understandings and their impact over present-day Arctic Indigenous
policies, as well as understanding how they can articulate alternative
visions of Arctic economic development is an urgent task.
