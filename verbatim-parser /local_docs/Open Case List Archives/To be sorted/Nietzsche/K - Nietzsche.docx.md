enhanced. **[This]{.underline}** is the deep ambiguity from which the

**[necessary, because a world without misfortune is one that has taken

sacrifice itself. **[There must be homeless]{.underline}** people and

humility.]{.underline}** At a time when the Church, through its most
qualified spokesmen, is questioning the ambivalence of Christian
charity, it is the laity-usually Marxists- who are reviving its most
dubious reflexes. To take the most oppressed as a measure, as our good
Samaritans do, is to imply that suffering and death are not just
failures of an unjust worldwide economic system, but are also part "of
the immemorial drama of our relation to the Creator**."** It means that,
far from being abominable and outrageous, **t**he oppressed embellish
and typify the human condition. This bottomless pit of suffering becomes
the tribunal**[,]{.underline}** the supreme court that admonishes the
privileged and leisured members of the human race. The fact that people
are wallowing in rags and mud strengthens the indictment of silk and
ermine. The intolerable disorder of the world is constantly underlined,
the eye of an avenging God is cast on it, and he watches over it and
endlessly enumerates its weaknesses and faults. The West is satanized
and the Third World becomes fixed in its role of the persecuted, the
better to show that no compromise at all is possible between them, aside
from the infinite repentance of the West. With a remarkable talent for
spotting every ethnic group, or others who have been subject to
persecution in some way, the world is searched for sadness, bad luck and
misfortune. An obscene joy lists the millions of alarms ringing in the
world, and a sort of **[morbid delight is taken in the systematic ruin
of]{.underline}** the **[thousands]{.underline}** of forms of life on
the globe. Such liberals are **[like hemophiliacs in love with human
suffering, ready to bleed for any case]{.underline}**; they are the
professional mourners of modern history. They have no sooner dried their
tears when a new subject for lamentation makes them start weeping anew.
**[Failures and distress are collected because they serve as a clear
warning---you have enjoyed yourselves too much]{.underline}**, you have
wasted too much. You must prepare yourselves for abstinence, chastity,
and a return to the land. Hunger in the world is the punishment for our
own European sinfulness. Supermarkets, naked women, homosexuality, paper
money, Coca Cola- all these are the corruptors of the healthy young of
the underdeveloped world. The theme of atonement used to be one of the
political Right, but it is now that of the Left. It is a miraculous
reconciliation of the ashes of Marshal Petain and Lenin's tomb under the
patronage of a weeping Jesus Christ of Naples.

\[Jonny, "Nietzsche's Critique of Utilitarianism," *Journal of Nietzsche
Studies*, Issue 29, muse\]

Nietzsche's preliminary account of the difference between master
morality and slave morality in *Beyond Good and Evil* culminates with
the conclusion that **["\[s\]lave morality is essentially a morality of
utility]{.underline}**" (260). Although Nietzsche develops the notorious
distinction between master and slave morality most fully in the
*Genealogy*, he articulates the sense in which he considers
utilitarianism a form of **[slave morality]{.underline}** in a revealing
passage in *Beyond Good and Evil*. Here he speculates that the noble,
aristocratic man first identifies himself and those like him (powerful,
proud, distinguished men) as good, and then contrasts himself with those
he contemptuously regards **[as]{.underline}** "the cowardly, the timid,
the petty" and, above all, "**[those who think only of narrow
utility]{.underline}**" (*BGE* 260). **[The noble's power consists not
only in his ability to exploit others]{.underline}** with his superior
acumen or physical strength **[but also in exercising "power over
himself," by refraining from acting on the inclination of pity that
characterizes those whom he despises. The slave, conversely, identifies
himself negatively; he is part of the group that resents those who
unabashedly exercise their power.]{.underline}** Nietzsche scorns slave
morality because its proponents meekly resign themselves to whatever
master morality is not, and yet consider their own moral principles
universally binding rather than acknowledging them as narrowly useful
for members of their own group. In the Christian tradition, "pity, the
kind and helping hand, the warm heart, patience, industriousness,
humility, friendliness come into honor---for these are the most *useful*
qualities \[for the slave\]" (*BGE* 260). Although Nietzsche thinks
utilitarians share these values, he does not consider their values
coextensive with Christian morality, since hedonistic utilitarianism is
concerned with maximizing the very sensation that Christian morality
aims to suppress: pleasure (*WP* 35).5 The partial coincidence between
Christian and utilitarian values results in part, Nietzsche thinks, from
the fact that **[utilitarians construe "utility" in exceedingly familiar
terms. The pleasure they seek is not that of the voluptuary or
conqueror, but that of the "herd animal"---the "boring" and "mediocre"
enjoyment of people who have yet to awaken from the "soporific" spell of
slave morality]{.underline}** (*BGE* 228).6 **[What does it mean to
espouse the values of a herd animal?]{.underline}** We have already
encountered some of the values Nietzsche associates with slave
morality---**[humility, industriousness, pity]{.underline}**, but in
what sense are they "herd" values? If the fundamental goal of an animal
within a herd is its own preservation, and if its own preservation
depends upon the health of the herd of which it is a member, then,
Nietzsche supposes, the moral principles of that group will tend to
reflect the kind of egalitarianism embodied in Bentham's dictum,
"Everybody counts for one, and nobody for more than one."7 Nietzsche
considers this the essence of herd mentality: "\[**[I\]t is the instinct
of the herd that finds its formula in this rule---one is equal, one
takes oneself for equal"]{.underline}** (*WP* 925). According to
Nietzsche, this egalitarian formula originates from the benefit that
comes from reciprocal cooperation among equals in a group, but has been
extended by Christian morality to apply to all people---including
*un*equals. Nietzsche thus construes the golden rule as a precept of
"prudence" or mutual advantage, observing that "John Stuart **[Mill
believes in it"as the basis of morality, but that he fails to grasp its
prudential origin]{.underline}** (*WP* 925).8

**B. Link Universal ethics are an expression of resentment that deny
chaos and reduce all life to base cogs. The aff's moral theory turns
itself by reducing human life to the lowest common denominator.**

**Conway, 1997** \[Daniel W. Ph.D, Professor and Department Head of
Philosophy, Nietzsche & the Political, Routledge, 29-30\]

Especially when viewed from the broadly historical perspective that
Nietzsche favors, however, **[the enterprise of morality encompasses far
more than the universal prescriptions]{.underline}** and metaphysical
fictions that he *so famously debunks. In fact, he regularly reminds his
readers that the type of morality he* *opposes is only one among several
possible moralities:Morality in Europe today is herd animal* morality-in
other words, as we understand it, merely *one* type of human morality
beside which, before which, and after which many other types,. above all
*higher* moralities, are or ought to be, possible. But **[this morality
resists such a \"possibility,\" such an \"ought\" with all its
power]{.underline}**: **[it says]{.underline}** stubbornly and
inexorably, \"**[I am morality itself, and nothing besides is
morality.\"]{.underline}** (BGE **202)**Continuing this critique of
moral monism in his next book, *On the Genealogy of Morals,* he declares
that contemporary morality, despite its claims to **[universality, is in
fact descended from a \"slave\" morality]{.underline}**, which in turn
emerged only in response to the hegemony of a logically and historically
prior \"noble\" morality. The history of morality, encrypted in the
\"long hieroglyphic record\" that Nietzsche aims to decipher (GM P:7),
thus contradicts the claim of *any* morality, including the ubiquitous
\"herd animal morality,\" to a privileged, monistic prerogative as the
arbiter of ethical life. In his \"review\" of the *Genealogy,* he
explicitly identifies the \"slave revolt in morality\" with \"the birth
of Christianity out of the spirit of *ressentiment\"* (EH XI).**[A
universally binding morality would necessarily erect a monolithic moral
ideal, thereby reducing a plurality of human types and kinds to a lowest
common denominator. Ethical laws should (and do) bind collectively, but
only across a limited number of individuals]{.underline}**, such as
constitute a people, race, tribe, or community. As Zarathustra puts it,
\"I am a law only for my kind \[die Meinen\], I am no law for all\" (Z
IV:12). The dream of an ethical community comprising all human beings,
or all sentient beings, thus spells political nightmare. **[The laws of
an omni-inclusive ethical community would express only the commonalities
and banalities of the individuals involved, rather than their unique
strengths and virtues. Morality should always serve the enhancement of
the ethical life of a particular people, and not the other way
around.]{.underline}**

B. Link **Infinite obligation to the other fails in the face of two
political realities:**

1)  **It becomes an excuse for permanent war against those seen as
    violators of the ethical order, and**

2)  **The example of the suicide bomber renders those ethics
    incoherent---who is saved by allowing the determined suicide bomber
    to live?**

**Meister, 05** (Postmodern Culture, \"Never Again\": The Ethics of the
Neighbor and the Logic of Genocide

It is, of course, possible to attack Lévinas using Carl Schmitt\'s
argument against **[the discourse of humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}** following the Treaty of Versailles: that it
[**creates a *casus belli* against the forces of
\"inhumanity,\"**]{.underline} especially when they claim to be pursuing
historical justice in ways that disturb the peace by treating the
\"other\" as the \"same\" (Schmitt, *The Concept of the Political* 71).
[Suicide bombings would seem to be a paradigmatic example]{.underline}
of this: encountering the other as a disguised human bomb would suggest
that fear *of* her and fear *for* her are not as fundamentally distinct
as Lévinas himself claims. **[When we rescue the suicide bomber are we
saving her or ourselves?]{.underline}** And if we murder her instead,
what becomes of us? Do we reveal ourselves, like those whom Lévinas
condemns, to be more afraid of dying than of killing? What does it mean
for her to be equally unafraid of both? And does her self-chosen death
qualify her as a martyr or a monster, whether or not she succeeds in
bringing innocent others to their deaths along with her? In certain
political \"neighborhoods,\" [**Lévinas\'s concept of the ultimately
unknowable human face can be both ethical and awful in ways that reopen
the possibility of a horrifying response. The ethical temptation to
treat suicide bombers as \"inhumans\" in human disguise applies *a
fortiori* to the politics of third-party intervention raised at the
beginning of this essay: when neighbors kill neighbors, whom do we
rescue and whom do we attack**?]{.underline} Is the third party in this
situation just another neighbor?

**B. Link: The ethics of the obligation to the other fall flat in the

**Brown, 04** (Nicholas, University of Illinois at Chicago, Or, Alain

[**What guarantees the otherness of the other**]{.underline} in the

posited.]{.underline} What this implies, first of all, is that [**the

at all**.]{.underline} Second, we are compelled to ask: why this will to
otherness? Once again, Badiou critiques the laicized, multiculturalist
version of this ethics by staging it. In its everyday form, without the
support of the Altogether Other, [the ethics of difference bifurcates as
soon as it is put into play]{.underline}. Its attitude towards any
rigorously sustained difference is entirely different from the attitude
it believes itself to have towards difference-as-such[. A rigorously
sustained religious difference? Fundamentalism. Rigorously sustained
political difference? Extremism. Rigorously sustained cultural
difference? Barbarism. \"As a matter of fact, **this celebrated
\'other\' is acceptable only if ~~he~~ is a good other**---**which is to

acceptable difference is one that also merely \"accepts\"

of the other is effectively a discourse of the Same**: a cosmopolitan
fantasy of liberal-democratic, free-market society: \"**nothing other

**The impact is that a "moral obligation" to assist the needy creates a
guilt economy requiring people to be in need so we can fulfill our
obligation. Rather than recognizing their intrinsic humanity we enslave
people in need by pitying their state of existence. Assisting others
allows us to fantasize that we are omnipotent individuals upon whom they
rely. By attempting to become enviable persons we dehumanize the
existence of others by viewing them merely as creatures to be helped.
Ure writes:**

> Michael Ure, "The Irony of Pity: Nietzsche contra Schopenhauer and
> Rousseau." The Journal of Nietzsche Studies - Issue 32, Autumn 2006,
> pp. 68-91

It is for this reason that Nietzsche claims that overcoming the feeling
of selflack and **[restoring]{.underline}** the vanity of
**[self-affection are the motivating forces of the kind of
pity]{.underline}** Rousseau and Schopenhauer identify **[as the source
of all our moral actions]{.underline}.** Couched in psychoanalytic
terms, our feelings of self-lack are a reignition of infantile rage over
our asymmetrical dependence on an idealized, self-sufficient other. Pity
serves to soothe this envious rage by overturning the asymmetry that the
needy, dependent child fears may lead to its abandonment. These
psychoanalytic insights are implicit in Nietzsche's treatment of
Rousseau and Schopenhauer. It is because Nietzsche sees how their notion
of **[pity is]{.underline}** shaped by this psychological matrix that he
argues that it is both **[self-serving and damaging to the
other]{.underline}**. On the plane of fantasy, he suggests, as pitiers
we imagine the others on whom we depend as self-sufficient and we play
the game of pity in order to redress this asymmetry. We do so **[by
attempting to make ourselves appear as enviable and self-sufficient
individuals on whose beneficence others must depend.]{.underline}** In
the psychological transaction of pity, as Nietzsche sees it, **[we aim
to spoil others by making their suffering the occasion for undermining
their independence and asserting our own]{.underline}**. As Nietzsche
explains in the following aphorism: If we love, honour, admire someone
and then afterwards discover that he is suffering . . . our feeling of
love, reverence and admiration changes in an essential respect: it grows
tenderer; that is to say, the gulf between us and him seems to be
bridged, an approximation to identity seems to occur. Only now do we
conceive it possible that we might give back to him, while he previously
dwelt in our imagination as being elevated above our gratitude. This
capacity to give back produces in us great joy and exaltation. . . .
\[W\]e have the enjoyment of active gratitude---which, in short, is
benevolent revenge. **[If he wants and takes nothing whatever from us,
we go away]{.underline}** chilled and **[saddened]{.underline},** almost
**[offended]{.underline}**. . . . From all of this it follows that, even
in the most favorable cases, there is something degrading in suffering
and something elevating and productive of superiority in pitying---which
separates these two sensations from one another to all eternity. (D 138)
As Nietzsche analyzes it here, [**as pitiers** **our giving is motivated
by the desire to usurp the position of imagined omnipotence, rather than
by the other's desire for our pity.**]{.underline} (It is this insight
that informs Zarathustra's caution that pity should always be a
conjecture---"May your pity be a conjecture: that you may first know if
your friend wants pity" \[Z:1 "Of the Friend"\].) For Nietzsche the fact
that as pitiers we are driven by our desire to restore our
self-affection is disclosed by our feeling of offence if the other does
not appreciate our "gift" of Mitleid: "Refusing gratitude.---One may
well refuse a request, but one may never refuse gratitude (or what comes
to the same thing, receive it coldly or conventionally). To do so is
very wounding---and why?" (D 235). Through gift giving inspired by such
pity, Nietzsche implies, we try to exact from the other the kind of
acknowledgment that can aid us in our attempt to restore our fantasy of
plenitude. **[As a sign of their subordination to us, the gratitude of
others can serve to bolster our fragile illusion of
omnipotence]{.underline}**. In this context, therefore, if others refuse
our gift of pitying concern, they are, as it were, refusing to grant us
the right to feel or imagine ourselves as elevated above them. In this
regard, the gift of Mitleid is really a gift we attempt to bestow on
ourselves at the other's expense.

The alternative is to reject the affirmative and reorient ourselves
toward experiences of suffering. Saying that "people in need" ought to
be assisted imposes our own meaning on their lives, thereby making the
affirmative's moral obligation self-defeating by destroying any
self-worth that people in need have. Only by embracing eternal
recurrence can we love every single moment of our lives and establish
meaningful relations with other persons. Kain writes:

"Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence." The
Journal of Nietzsche Studies. Issue 33, Spring, 2007.

We have seen that in Nietzsche\'s opinion **we cannot bear meaningless
suffering and so we give it a meaning**. Christianity, for example,
explains it as punishment for sin. **Eternal recurrence**, however,
would certainly seem to plunge us back into meaningless suffering (*WP*
55). It **implies that suffering just happens**, it repeats eternally,
it is fated. There is no plan, no purpose, no reason for it. Eternal
recurrence would seem to rub our noses in meaningless suffering. In one
sense this is perfectly correct. And Nietzsche does want to accept as
much meaninglessness and suffering as he can bear (*BGE* 39, 225; *WP*
585a). Nevertheless, we must see that there is meaning here---it is just
that it lies precisely in the meaninglessness. **[Embracing eternal
recurrence means imposing suffering on oneself]{.underline}**,
meaningless suffering, suffering that just happens, suffering for no
reason at all. But at the very same time, this creates the innocence of
existence. The meaninglessness of suffering means the innocence of
suffering. That is the new meaning that suffering is given. Suffering no
longer has its old meaning. Suffering no longer has the meaning
Christianity gave to it. Suffering can no longer be seen as punishment.
There is no longer any guilt. There is no longer any sin. One is no
longer accountable (*TI* \"Errors\" 8; *HH* 99). **[If suffering just
returns eternally]{.underline}**, if even the slightest change is
impossible, how can one be to blame for it? **[How can one be
responsible?]{.underline}** It can be none of our doing. We are
innocent. **[This could explain why one would be able to embrace eternal
recurrence, love every detail of one\'s life, not wish to change a
single moment of suffering]{.underline}**. One would be embracing one\'s
own innocence. One would be loving one\'s own redemption from guilt.
Eternal recurrence brings the Übermensch as close as possible to the
truth, meaninglessness, the void, but it does not go all the way or it
would crush even the Übermensch. **[Eternal recurrence
gives]{.underline}** the Übermensch **[meaning. It eliminates
emptiness.]{.underline}** It fills the void. With what? It fills it with
something totally familiar and completely known; with something that is
in no way new, different, or strange; with something that is not at all
frightening. **[It fills the void with one\'s own
life]{.underline}**---repeated eternally. It is true that this life is a
life of suffering, but (given the horror of existence) **suffering
cannot be avoided anyway**, and at least suffering has been stripped of
any surplus suffering brought about by concepts of sin, punishment, or
guilt. It has been reduced to a life of innocence. Moreover, as
Nietzsche has said, it is only meaningless suffering that is the
problem. If given a meaning, even suffering becomes something we can
seek (*GM* III:28). Eternal recurrence, the fatedness of suffering, its
meaningless repetition, makes our suffering innocent. That might well be
reason enough to embrace it. Or, although *we* may not be able to
embrace it ourselves, I think we can at least see why Nietzsche
might---and even why it might *make sense* for him to do so. Eternal
recurrence also gives suffering another meaning. If one is able to
embrace eternal recurrence, **[if one is able to turn all \"it was\"
into a \"thus I willed it,\" then one]{.underline}** not only reduces
suffering to physical suffering, **[breaks its psychological
stranglehold]{.underline}**, and eliminates surplus suffering related to
guilt, but one may even in a sense reduce suffering below the level of
physical suffering. **[One does not do this]{.underline}** as the
liberal, socialist, or Christian would, **[by changing the world to
reduce suffering]{.underline}**. In Nietzsche\'s opinion **[that is
impossible, and]{.underline}**, indeed, **[eternal
recurrence]{.underline}** of the same **[rules it
out]{.underline}**---at least as any sort of final
achievement.[^23^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v033/33.1kain.html#FOOT23)
Rather, **[physical suffering is reduced by treating it as a
test]{.underline}**, a discipline, a training, which brings one greater
power. One might think of an athlete who engages in more and more
strenuous activity, accepts greater and greater pain, handles it better
and better, and sees this as a sign of greater strength, as a sign of
increased ability. Pain and suffering are turned into empowerment.
Indeed, it is possible to love such suffering as a sign of increased
power. One craves pain---\"*more* pain! *more* pain!\" (*GM* III:20).
And the more suffering one can bear, the stronger one becomes. If
suffering is self-imposed, if the point is to break the psychological
stranglehold it has over us, if the point is to turn suffering into
empowerment, use it as a discipline to gain greater strength, then it
would be entirely inappropriate for us to feel sorry for the sufferer.
[**To take pity on the sufferer**]{.underline} either would demonstrate
an ignorance of the process the sufferer is engaged in, what the
sufferer is attempting to accomplish through suffering, or **[would show
a lack of respect for the sufferer\'s suffering]{.underline}** (*GS*
338; *D* 135). To pity the sufferer, **[to wish the sufferer did not
have to go through such suffering, would demean the sufferer and the
whole process of attempting to gain greater strength through such
suffering.]{.underline}** Let us try again to put ourselves in
Nietzsche\'s place. He has suffered for years. He has suffered intensely
for years. He has come to realize that he cannot end this suffering. He
cannot even reduce it significantly. But he has finally been able to
break the psychological stranglehold it has had over him. He is able to
accept it. He wills it. He would not change the slightest detail. He is
able to love it. And this increases his strength. **How**, then,
**[would he respond to our pity?]{.underline}** Very likely[, **he would
be offended**]{.underline}. He would think we were patronizing him. He
would not want us around. **[He would perceive us as trying to rob him
of the strength he had achieved, subjugate him again to his suffering,
strip him of his dignity. He would be disgusted with our attempt to be
do-gooders, our attempt to impose our own meaning on his suffering
(treating it as something to pity and to lessen) in opposition to the
meaning he has succeeded in imposing on it.]{.underline}**

To appreciate how committed he is, **[suppose we are]{.underline}**
incorrigible **[do-gooders]{.underline}**---liberals, socialists, or
Christians. **[We just cannot bear to see anyone suffer]{.underline}**.
**[Suppose we find a researcher who is working on a cure for

a few years a drug can be produced to eliminate the disease. **[Suppose

Nietzsche has solidly committed to eternal recurrence]{.underline}**,
just as he is able to love his fate, just as he has decided he would not
change the slightest detail of his life, **[we tell him about this
cure]{.underline}**. How would Nietzsche respond? Would he accept the
cure? **[Would he give up his hard-won attitude of accepting his
migraines, nausea, and vomiting, of refusing to desire any
change]{.underline}**? Would he revert to his old attitude of hoping to
reduce his suffering, trying out whatever might accomplish this?
**[Would he give his illness a chance to reassert its psychological
stranglehold?]{.underline}** We must remember that our supposition is
that he would actually be cured in a few years. But he would also forgo
the discipline, the strengthening, the empowerment that a commitment to
eternal recurrence and amor fati would have made possible. **[Although
his illness would be cured, he would not have developed the wherewithal
to deal with any other suffering---in a world characterized by the
horror of existence.]{.underline}** We cannot know whether Nietzsche
would decide to take the cure or not. What we can be sure of is that if
he did, he would not be the Nietzsche we know. Kierkegaard retells the
story of Abraham and Isaac. God commands Abraham to take his only son to
Mount Moriah and to sacrifice him there as a burnt offering. Faithful
Abraham sets off to obey God\'s will. But just as he arrives, just as he
has drawn his knife, just as he is about to offer his son, he is told
instead to sacrifice the ram that God has prepared. Kierkegaard suggests
that if he had been in Abraham\'s position, if he had sufficient faith
in God and had obeyed him as Abraham did, if he had been able to summon
the same courage, then, when he got Isaac back again he would have been
embarrassed. Abraham, he thinks, was not embarrassed. He was not
embarrassed because he believed all along, by virtue of the absurd, that
God would not require
Isaac.[24](http://208.34.222.250/bin/rdas.dll/RDAS_SVR=muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v033/33.1kain.html#FOOT24)
What about Nietzsche? **[Let us assume that Nietzsche]{.underline}** has
fully committed to eternal recurrence and amor fati, that he **[has come
to love his fate, that he has decided he would not change the slightest
detail]{.underline}**. Moreover, he has announced this to the world in
his writings. Let us assume that over the years this commitment has
empowered him, given him greater strength. **[We do-gooders now inform
him that we can cure his disease and eliminate his
suffering.]{.underline}** Even further, **[suppose we were able to prove
to him that eternal recurrence is impossible.]{.underline}** Would
Nietzsche be embarrassed? Maybe. But it is not absolutely clear that he
would be. He might respond that **[believing in eternal

**Kain**, Phillip **2007**, "Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the
Horror of Existence"
<http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v033/33.1kain.html>

I think we are now in a position to see that for eternal recurrence to
work, for it to have the effect that it must have for Nietzsche, we must
accept without qualification, we must love, every single moment of our
lives, every single moment of suffering**. [We cannot allow ourselves to
be tempted by what might at first sight seem to be a much more appealing
version of eternal recurrence]{.underline}**, that is, a recurring life
that would include the desirable aspects of our present life while
leaving out the undesirable ones**[. To give in to such temptation
would]{.underline}** be to risk losing everything that has been gained.
To give in to such temptation, I suggest, would **[allow the suffering
in our present life to begin to reassert its psychological
stranglehold]{.underline}**. We would start to slip back into
subjugation. We would again come to be dominated by our suffering.
**[We]{.underline}** \[End Page 57\] **[would spend our time trying to
minimize it]{.underline}**, or avoid it, **or** ameliorate it, **[or
cure it. We would again become slaves to it.]{.underline}** For the same
reason, **[I do not think it will work for us to accept eternal
recurrence merely because of]{.underline}** one or **[a few grand
moments---for the sake of which we are willing to tolerate the rest of
our lives]{.underline}**. Magnus holds that all we need desire is the
return of one peak
experience.[21](http://208.34.222.250/bin/rdas.dll/RDAS_SVR=muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v033/33.1kain.html#FOOT21)
This suggests that our attitude toward much of our life, even most of
it, could be one of toleration, acceptance, or indifference---it could
even be negative. All we need do is love one great moment and, because
all moments are interconnected (Z IV: \"The Drunken Song\" 10; WP 1032),
that then will require us to accept all moments. This would be much
easier than actually loving all moments of one\'s life---every single
detail. The latter is what is demanded in Ecce Homo, which says that
amor fati means that one \"wants nothing to be different\" and that we
\"\[n\]ot merely bear what is necessary . . . but love it\" (EH
\"Clever\" 10, emphasis **added \[except to love\]).** We want \"a
Yes-saying without reservation, even to suffering. . . **[. Nothing in
existence may be subtracted, nothing is dispensable . .
.\"]{.underline}** (EH \"BT\" 2). **[If we do not love every moment of
our present life for its own sake, those moments we do not love, those
moments]{.underline}** we accept for the sake of one grand moment, I
suggest, will begin to **wear on
us**.**[22](http://208.34.222.250/bin/rdas.dll/RDAS_SVR=muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v033/33.1kain.html#FOOT22)**
We will begin to wish we did not have to suffer through so many of them,
we will try to develop strategies for coping with them, we will worry
about them, they will start to reassert themselves[, **they will slowly
begin to dominate us, and pretty soon we will again be enslaved by
them.**]{.underline} Our attitude toward any moment cannot be a desire
to avoid it, change it, or reduce it---or it will again begin to
dominate us. Indeed, in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche says that he had to display
a \"Russian fatalism.\" He did so by tenaciously clinging for years to
all but intolerable situations, places, apartments, and society, merely
because they happened to be given by accident: it was better than
changing them, than feeling that they could be changed---than rebelling
against them. Any attempt to disturb me in this fatalism, to awaken me
by force, used to annoy me mortally---and it actually was mortally
dangerous every time. Accepting oneself as if fated, not wishing oneself
\"different\"---that is in such cases great reason itself. (EH \"Wise\"
6) Eternal recurrence is an attempt to deal with meaningless suffering.
It is an attempt to do so that completely rejects an approach to
suffering that says, Let\'s improve the world, let\'s change things,
let\'s work step by step to remove suffering---the view of liberals and
socialists whom Nietzsche so often rails against. **[If it is impossible
to significantly reduce suffering in the world]{.underline}**, as
Nietzsche thinks it is, then to **[make it your goal to try to do so is
to enslave yourself to that suffering.]{.underline}** \[End Page 58\]

How should we comport ourselves to the suffering we find in our lives?
**[When touching a hot stove or confronted with danger, our natural
reactions are to pull back, to flee, to find safety]{.underline}**. In
general it seems that we naturally shy away from discomfort and
pain---suffering of all types. The child laments his boring afternoon
and the adult fears the impending death of a parent and the subsequent
anguish the loss will bring, hoping and wishing they will never come.
Suffering, it seems, is quite rightly seen as undesirable. **[However:
When a misfortune strikes us, we can overcome it either by removing its
cause or]{.underline}** else **[by changing the effect it has on our
feelings]{.underline}**, that is, **[by reinterpreting the misfortune as
a good, whose benefit may only later become clear.]{.underline}**

So, should we seek to abolish suffering as far as we can by removing its
cause, or should we attempt to change our attitude toward suffering such
that it is no longer seen as (always) undesirable? Taking Nietzsche
seriously when he says that **[it is the meaning of our suffering that
has been the problem]{.underline}**, I will attempt to indirectly answer
this question by looking at two possibilities found in Nietzsche for
giving meaning to our suffering. The first possibility concerns a
religious ethic that, according to Nietzsche, views suffering as
undesirable, but which ultimately uses mendacious and deleterious means
to provide a meaning for human suffering. The second possibility
concerns the extent to which we can say **[Nietzsche endorsed the idea
of giving meaning to suffering through acknowledging its necessary role
in human enhancement and greatness. Since the religious ethic sees
suffering as undesirable and thus something ultimately to be
avoided]{.underline}** (being itself the paradigmatic means for easing
suffering), **[and the means it uses to give suffering meaning are
ultimately mendacious]{.underline}**, I will argue that if Nietzsche is
significantly correct in both his attack on religious morality and his
alternative ideal, we can take this as evidence that the **[avoidance of
suffering is not the proper attitude]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, I
will not be able to address the question of whether Nietzsche is
significantly correct in this paper. Secondly, **[given Nietzsche's
positive alternative---one that embraces the necessary role suffering
has for the enhancement of human life]{.underline}**---I will argue that
we can take this as evidence that **[it is our attitude toward suffering
that needs to be modified]{.underline}**, i.e., **[we should modify so
that we no longer see suffering as something to be
avoided]{.underline}**. Because of this, the middle position of avoiding
suffering when possible and then seeing its positive attributes when it
does occur does not recommend itself. That is, **[since it will be
argued that suffering has a positive and necessary role to play, to seek
to avoid it as far as possible and then to acknowledge its positive
aspects when it does occur,]{.underline}** is not really to acknowledge
and accept suffering's positive and necessary role. However, as we will
see, all of this is complicated by the issue of the order of rank as
found in Nietzsche's writings.

**ALT SOLVES: Value to Life**

**Suffering and loss are inevitable parts of a chaotic world---our
alternative enables us to find meaning and lead a joyful life despite
crises.**

**Groff 04** -- Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Bucknell University
-- 2004 (Peter S, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, "Al-Kindi and Nietzsche
on the Stoic Art of Banishing Sorrow," Issue 28, Autumn 2004, pg.
139-173)

Nietzsche goes on to reflect on the lies and \"deadly silence\" with
which the advocates of extirpation have tried to hide the \"over-rich
happiness\" \[überreiche Glück\] of passionate people, and concludes:
\"Is our life really painful and burdensome enough to make it
advantageous to exchange it for a Stoic way of life and petrification?
We are not so badly off that we have to be as badly off as Stoics\" (GS
326). But Nietzsche is merely scratching the surface here, for [the more
fundamental question is whether suffering is something that necessarily
ought to be ameliorated]{.underline}. In an earlier aphorism from the
same book, Nietzsche ostensibly accepts the Stoics\' doctrine of the
inextricable bond between pleasure and pain, while at the same time
drawing a radically different conclusion: \[W\]hat if pleasure \[Lust\]
and displeasure \[Unlust\] were so tied together that whoever wanted to
have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of
the other---that whoever wanted to learn to \"jubilate up to the
heavens\" would also have to be prepared for \"depression unto death\"?
And that is how things may well be. At least the Stoics believed that
this was how things were, and they were consistent when they also
desired as little pleasure as possible, in order to get as little
displeasure as possible out of life\.... To this day [you have a choice:
either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief \... or
as much displeasure as possible as the price for the growth of an
abundance of subtle pleasures]{.underline} \[Lüsten\] and joys
\[Freuden\] that have rarely been relished yet. [If you decide for the
former and desire to diminish and lower the level of human
pain]{.underline} \[Schmerzhaftigkeit\], [you also have to diminish and
lower the level of their capacity for joy]{.underline}. Nietzsche
concludes this aphorism with a rumination on the power of science to
promote either goal: it can make us \"colder, more like a statue, more
Stoic,\" but it also has the \"immense capacity for making new galaxies
of joy flare up\" (GS 12). To some extent, the Stoics function in this
passage as a foil for Nietzsche\'s imperative to experiment---or \"live
dangerously,\" as he famously puts it (GS 283)---and one is reminded of
Nietzsche\'s reflections on the health of the soul, where he poses the
troubling question of the potential value of illness (GS 120). However,
in spite of this we can already begin to see a more fundamental
agreement between Nietzsche and the Stoics that underlies their
internecine dispute and indeed makes it possible in the first place.
Nietzsche\'s claim that \"much displeasure\" is a prerequisite for our
capacity to experience great joy recalls his claim that suffering is a
condition for the possibility of human greatness. Yet this assertion is
not necessarily at odds with Stoic ethics, for whenever Nietzsche extols
the virtues of suffering (insofar as it makes us profound and
contributes to the growth and intensification of power), his primary
target is the morality of pity. And Nietzsche and the Stoics are
actually in accordance in their low estimation of the value of pity
\[Mitleid\] (D 139).75 Thus in order to understand Nietzsche\'s
Stoicism, it is crucial to distinguish between eliminating suffering and
banishing sorrow. Nietzsche explicitly rejects the former program,
inasmuch as it makes us small, mediocre, and ignoble. However, while
Nietzsche valorizes suffering, he by no means advocates sorrow. [The
essential Nietzschean orientation toward the world is not one of
recoiling, sadness, or regret, but rather one of affirmation, gaiety,
cheerfulness, and joy. In order to make sense of this apparent tension
in his thought, we might provisionally think of suffering as a brute,
inescapable fact of embodied existence, and sorrow as one optional
interpretation of that experience. In other words, sorrow and joy both
have to do with one\'s interpretation and evaluation of the meaning and
value of suffering.]{.underline} The Stoic can no more eliminate
suffering than he can eliminate loss. As became clear in al-Kindī\'s
epistle, [loss is necessary and inevitable, but sorrow is not. In a
similar way, the Nietzschean \"ideal\" is to become strong and healthy
enough joyfully to affirm the entirety of existence---even its
\"accursed and loathsome aspects,\" including suffering]{.underline}
(KSA 13.16\[32\], cf. EH P3). To attain this standpoint, I suggest, is
to banish sorrow.

**ALT SOLVES: Intolerance**

**Affirmation of difference enables a more robust conception of
tolerance. We do not advocate a nihilistic abandonment of values but the
simple acceptance that others will have competing values.**

**Hatab, 02** (Lawrence J. Professor of Philosophy at Old Dominion
Univrsity 2002 Prospects for a Democratic Agon Why We can still be
Nietzscheans: The Journal of Nietzsche p.MUSE)

In fact, Nietzschean conceptions of agonistics and [nonfoundational
openness can go a long way toward articulating and defending democratic
practices without the problems attaching to traditional principles of
equality]{.underline}. If political respect implies inclusiveness and an
open regard for the rightful participation of others, an agonistic model
of politics can underwrite respect without the need for substantive
conceptions of equality or even something like \"equal regard.\" I have
already mentioned that agonistics can be seen as a fundamentally social
phenomenon. Since the self is formed in and through tensional relations
with others, then any annulment of my Other would be an annulment of
myself. Radical agonistics, then, discounts the idea of sheer autonomy
and self-constitution. Such a tensional sociality can much more readily
affirm the place of the Other in social relations than can modern models
of subject-based freedom. Moreover, the structure of an agon conceived
as a contest can readily underwrite political principles of fairness.
Not only do I need an Other to prompt my own achievement, but the
significance of any \"victory\" I might achieve demands an able
opponent. As in athletics, defeating an incapable or incapacitated
competitor winds up being meaningless. So I should not only will the
presence of others in an agon, I should also want that they be able
adversaries, that they have opportunities and capacities to succeed in
the contest. And I should be able to honor the winner of a fair contest.
Such is the logic of competition that contains a host of normative
features, which might even include active provisions for helping people
in political contests become more able participants.
[25](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v024/24.1hatab.html#FOOT25)
In addition, agonistic respect need not be associated with something
like positive regard or equal worth, a dissociation that can go further
in facing up to actual political conditions and problematic connotations
that can attach to liberal dispositions. Again allow me to quote my
previous work. Democratic respect forbids exclusion, it demands
inclusion; but [respect for the Other as other can avoid a vapid sense
of \"tolerance,\" a sloppy \"relativism,\" or a misplaced spirit of
\"neutrality.\" Agonistic respect allows us to simultaneously affirm our
beliefs and affirm our opponents as worthy competitors]{.underline} in
public discourse. [Here we can speak of respect without ignoring the
fact that politics involves perpetual disagreement]{.underline}, and we
have an adequate answer to the question \"Why should I respect a view
that I do not agree with?\" In this way beliefs about what is best
(aristos) can be coordinated with an openness to other beliefs and a
willingness to accept the outcome of an open competition among the full
citizenry (demos). [Democratic respect, therefore, is a]{.underline}
dialogical [mixture of affirmation and negation, a political bearing
that entails giving all beliefs a hearing, refusing any belief an
ultimate warrant, and perceiving one\'s own viewpoint as agonistically
implicated with opposing viewpoints]{.underline}. In sum, we can
combine 1) the historical tendency of democratic movements to promote
free expression, pluralism, and liberation from traditional constraints,
and 2) a Nietzschean perspectivism and agonistic respect, to arrive at a
postmodern model of democracy that provides both a nonfoundational
openness and an atmosphere of civil political discourse.
[26](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v024/24.1hatab.html#FOOT26)
[An agonistic politics construed as competitive fairness can sustain a
robust conception of political rights, not as something \"natural\"
possessed by an original self, but as an epiphenomenal, procedural
notion conferred upon citizens in order to sustain viable political
practice]{.underline}. Constraints on speech, association, access, and
so on, simply insure lopsided political contests. We can avoid
metaphysical models of rights and construe them as simply social and
political phenomena: social in the sense of entailing reciprocal
recognition and obligation; political in the sense of being guaranteed
and enforced by the state. We can even defend so-called positive rights,
such as a right to an adequate education, as requisite for fair
competition in political discourse. Rights themselves can be understood
as agonistic in that a right-holder has a claim against some treatment
by others or for some provision that might be denied by others. In this
way rights can be construed as balancing power relations in social
milieus, as a partial recession of one\'s own power on behalf of the
power of others---which in fact is precisely how Nietzsche in an early
work described fairness and rights (D 112). And, as is well known, the
array of rights often issues conflicts of different and differing
rights, and political life must engage in the ongoing balancing act of
negotiating these tensions, a negotiation facilitated by precisely not
defining rights as discrete entities inviolably possessed by an
originating self. Beyond political rights, a broader conception of
rights, often designated as human rights as distinct from political
practice, can also be defended by way of the kind of nonfoundational,
negative sense of selfhood inspired by Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, the
self is a temporal openness infused with tragic limits, rather than some
metaphysical essence, stable substance, or eternal entity. A via
negativa can be utilized to account for rights as stemming not from what
we are but from what we are not. So much of abusive or exclusionary
treatment is animated by confident designations and reductions as to
\"natures\" having to do with race, gender, class, role, character, and
so on. \[End Page 143\] Nonfoundational challenges to \"identity\" may
seem unsettling, but if we consider how identities figure in injustices,
a good deal of [work can be done to reconfigure rights as based in
resistance. It is difficult to find some positive condition that can
justify rights and do so without excluding or suppressing some other
conditions. But a look at human history and experience can more readily
understand rights and freedom as emerging out of the irrepressible
tendency of human beings to resist and deny the adequacy of external
attributions as to what or who they \"are.\" It may be sufficient to
defend rights simply in terms of the human capacity to say
No]{.underline}.

**ALT SOLVES: NEW POLITICS**

**Over-turning ethical absolutes is critical to personal and political
transformation.**

**Brown, 2000** (Wendy, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Princeton
University and UC Berkeley Humanities Fellow "Nietzsche for Politics" in
"Why Nietzsche Still?" Edited by Alan Schrift, pg. 211-212)

Three different instances of genealogy\'s strategy of reversal emerge in
this passage. [Nietzsche reverses the givenness of everyday values,
upsetting their unchallengeable status in an effort to disclose the
power this status carries and covers. **Whatever has been accepted \"as
factual, as beyond all question,\" shall now be posed as a question, as
a fiction, as utterly dubious because utterly
contingent**]{.underline}**.** But if reversals function as a form of
questioning, they also emerge as part of the answer to the question.
Hence [the morally good is made to appear regressive and dangerous,
rather than progressive and valuable, while morality itself appears as
that which might inhibit]{.underline} rather than foment or express [the
"power and splendor\" of man.]{.underline} Finally,
[genealogy]{.underline} also [conjures a reversal in the accepted course
of history]{.underline}-it challenges progressive accounts with
intimations of regression, [as in suggesting that the present may be
\"living off the future\" rather than paving that future.]{.underline}
If Nietzsche in this preface articulates some of the critical workings
III genealogy and especially its refiguration of the relation between
knowledge and politics, such moments of self-consciousness about this
relation are relatively rare, Foucault renders much more explicit the
aims and effects of genealogy in this regard. He characterizes the
project of genealogy he adapts from Nietzsche as one of discerning the
political "ontology of the present.\" 10 Such discernment is expressly
contrasted with \"an analytics of truth\"-philosophical criticism-a
contrast achieved largely through a postmetaphysical historical, but not
historicist, orientation. A political ontology of the present, which
Foucault sometimes also describes in the terms of \'diagnosis,\' \"does
not consist in a simple characterization of what we are but, instead-by
following lines of fragility in the present-in managing to grasp why and
how that-which is might no longer be that-which-is.\" 11 [A political
ontology of the present,]{.underline} in short, [requires that form of
questioning that unsettles the present\'s givenness, that is \"made in
accordance with these kinds of virtual fracture which **open up the
space of freedom understood as a space of concrete freedom, i.e., of
possible transformation**.\"]{.underline} 12 Foucault\'s endeavor of a
\"diagnosis\" or \"ontology\" of the present entails reconfiguring both
the relationship of philosophy to history and the relation of philosophy
and history to politics. [The task of philosophy becomes curiously
historical: apprehending the nature of ourselves in the
present]{.underline}, [philosophy must recognize us as historical beings
and our time as a time in history. Conversely, history is subjected to
philosophical critique insofar as it must be divested of
reason]{.underline} and direction at the same time that it is tethered
to conventionally philosophical questions: [how can we know our time and
ourselves when we cannot move beyond or outside of them?]{.underline}
While never fully resolvable, Foucault responds to this problem on
genealogy\'s behalf: [\"Effective history studies what is closest, but
in all abrupt dispossession, so as to seize it at a
distance.\"]{.underline}13

K of Utilitarianism

**In the face of a crisis of suffering, we are presented with two
options:**

**1) the world of the AC---a life-denying will to calculate the greatest
good and manage the herd---dooming us to mediocrity and hatred for the
world. Or,**

**2) the alternative---we can accept that chaos and discord are
inevitable, that preventing suffering is impossible, and escape nihilism
by affirming life as it is.**

**Owen and Ridley, 2000** (David Owen is Reader in Political Philosophy
and Deputy Director of the Centre for Post-Analytic Philosophy at the
University of Southampton. He is the author of numerous books and
articles in social and political philosophy with a focus on Nietzsche.
Aaron Ridley is a professor of Philosophy at the School of Humanities at
the University of Southampton. He has also written multiple books about
Nietzschean ethics. Why Nietzsche still? page 149-54)

The threat here is obvious: What is to be feared, what has a more
calamitous effect than any other calamity, is that man should inspire
not profound fear but profound *nausea;* also not great fear but great
*pity.* Suppose these two were one day to unite, they would inevitably
beget one of the uncanniest monsters: the \"last will\" of man, his will
to nothingness, nihilism. And a great deal points to this union. *(GM*
III:I4) So suicidal nihilism beckons. The one response to the situation
that is absolutely ruled out is the one that has so far proved most
successful at addressing problems of this sort, namely, adoption of the
ascetic ideal, because the present crisis is caused by the
self-destruction of that ideal. But [Nietzsche argues that two plausible
responses to the crisis are]{.underline} nonetheless
[possible]{.underline} for modern man. Both of these involve the
construction of immanent ideals or goals: one response is represented by
the type the Last Man, the other by the type the *Ubermensch.* [The
first response recognizes the reality of suffering and]{.underline} our
(post-ascetic) inability to accord transcendental significance to it and
[concludes that the latter provides an overwhelming reason for
abolishing the former to whatever extent is possible.]{.underline} This
has the effect of elevating the abolition of suffering into a
quasi-transcendental goal and brings with it a new table of virtues, on
which prudence figures largest. In other words, [this response takes the
form of]{.underline} a *rapport a soi* characterized by a style of
**[calculative rationality directed toward the avoidance of suffering at
any cost]{.underline}**, for example, [**of utilititarianism and any
other account of human subjectivity that accords preeminence to
maximizing preference satisfaction**.]{.underline} In *Thus Spoke
Zarathustra* Nietzsche portrays this type as follows: \"What is love?
What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\" thus asks the Last
Man and blinks. [The earth has become small, and upon it hops the Last
Man, who makes everything small. His race is as inexterminable as the
flea; the Last Man lives longest. \"]{.underline}We have discovered
happiness,\" say the Last Men and blink. They have left the places where
living was hard: for one needs warmth. One still loves one\'s neighbor
and rubs oneself against him: for one needs warmth. Sickness and
mistrust count as sins with them: one should go about warily. He is a
fool who still stumbles over stones or over men! A little poison now and
then: that produces pleasant dreams. And a lot of poison at last, for a
pleasant death. They still work, for work is entertainment. But they
take care the entertainment does not exhaust them. Nobody grows rich or
poor any more: both are too much of a burden. Who still wants to rule?
Who obey? Both are too much of a burden. No herdsman and one herd.
[Everyone wants the same thing, everyone is the same: whoever thinks
otherwise goes voluntarily into the madhouse]{.underline} \"Formerly all
the world was mad,\" say the most acute of them and blink. They are
clever and know everything that has ever happened: so there is no end to
their mockery. They still quarrel, but they soon make up-otherwise
indigestion would result. They have their little pleasure for the day
and their little pleasure for the night: but they respect health. \"We
have discovered happiness,\" say the Last Men and blink. *(Z:* I
\"Prologue\" 5) [Nietzsche\'s]{.underline} hostility to this first form
of response is evident. His [general objection to the Last Man is that
the Last Man\'s ideal]{.underline}, like the ascetic ideal, [is
committed to the denial of chance and necessity as integral features of
human existence.]{.underline} Whereas the ascetic ideal denies chance
and necessity per se so that, while suffering remains real, what is
objectionable about it is abolished, [the Last Man\'s ideal is expressed
as the practical imperative to abolish suffering]{.underline}, and
hence, a fortiori, what is objectionable about it -- that is, our
exposure to chance and necessity. This general objection has two
specific dimensions. The first is that [**the Last Man\'s ideal is
unrealizable**, insofar as human existence involves ineliminable sources
of suffering-]{.underline}not least our consciousness that we come into
being by chance and cease to be by necessity. Thus the Last Man\'s ideal
is predicated on a neglect of truthfulness. The second dimension of
Nietzsche\'s objection is that **[pursuit of the Last Man\'s ideal
impoverishes and arbitrarily restricts our understanding of what we can
be and]{.underline}**, in doing so, [**forecloses our future
possibilities of becoming otherwise than we are**.]{.underline} Thus the
Last Man\'s ideal entails an atrophying of the capacities (for
self-overcoming, etc.) bequeathed by the ascetic ideal. Nietzsche brings
these two dimensions together in *Beyond Good and Evil:* \"You want, if
possible -- and there is no more insane \'if possible\' -- to *abolish
suffering.* \... Well-being as you understand it -- that is no goal,
that seems to us an *end,* a state that soon makes man ridiculous and
contemptible -- that makes his destruction *desirable\" (BGE 225).* [The
second response]{.underline} to the nihilistic threat posed by the
selfdestruction of the ascetic ideal is definitive of the *Ubermensch*
type. This response [**recognizes both the reality and the
ineliminability of suffering and concludes that an affirmation of chance
and necessity must therefore be built into the very conception of what
it is for something to function** as a (postascetic) ideal]{.underline}.
So [this response]{.underline}, insofar as it cultivates [an affirmation
of chance and necessity]{.underline} (i.e., *amor fati),* [overcomes
the]{.underline} (ascetic) [hatred of or]{.underline} (modern)
[dissatisfaction with this-worldly existence]{.underline}. Yet the
success of this overcoming is conditional on the exercise and
development of the very capacities and disposition that are the bequest
of the ascetic ideal. The disposition to truthfulness is a condition of
recognizing the ineliminability of chance and necessity. But actually to
recognize, let alone affirm, this awful fact about human existence
requires the exercise of the capacities for self-surveillance (so that
one can monitor oneself for the symptoms of self-deception in the face
of this fact), self-discipline (so that one can resist the
understandable temptation to deceive oneself about this fact), and
self-overcoming (so that one can develop, in the face of this
temptation, one\'s capacities for self-surveillance and
self-discipline). Thus the ascetic ideal provides the tools required to
overcome the crisis precipitated by its own self-destruction. In other
words, the *Ubermensch\'s* ideal simply is the exercise and cultivation
of the capacities and the disposition required to affirm the fact that
chance and necessity are ineliminable. And because chance and necessity
are ineliminable, and therefore require perpetually to be affirmed anew,
[such exercise and cultivation must itself be perpetual, a process
without the slightest prospect of an end. The contrast with the Last
Man\'s ideal is stark. Whereas the latter offers a feeling of power to
its devotees by positing as realizable the unrealizable ideal of no more
suffering-that is, of a fixed, final, *completed* state of being -- the
*Ubermensch's* ideal offers a feeling of power predicated only on the
continual overcoming of the desire for any such state.]{.underline} What
the Last Man longs for, in other words., the *Ubermensch* distinguishes
himself by unendingly and truthfully refusing to want. It is of the
first importance that **[the *Ubermensch\'s* ideal should represent a
*process* as inherently valuable, rather than a product (such as the
Last Man\'s completed state of life without suffering]{.underline}**).
There are two reasons for thinking this important. The first is the one
mentioned above given that chance and necessity are ineliminable
features of living a life, [a life oriented to the affirmation of this
fact must recognize the ineliminably processual character of such an
affirmation, and hence the ineliminably processual character of an ideal
that serves rather than denies \"the most fundamental prerequisites of
life]{.underline}\" *(GM* III:28). The other reason is that this ideal
exhibits the form of practical reasoning that Nietzsche\'s genealogy
itself deploys. By contrast with, say, Kant\'s conception of practical
reasoning, which centers on an opposition between the real and the ideal
(between the heteronomous and the autonomous), and denies \"the most
fundamental prerequisites of life,\" Nietzsche\'s conception involves a
continual process of movement from the attained to the attainable; and
it is precisely this that the *rapport a soi* constitutive of the
*Ubermensch* exhibits. Thus, while Kant offers a juridical conception of
practical reasoning structured in terms of the idea of *law,* Nietzsche
offers a medical or therapeutic conception articulated through the idea
of the type or exemplar. Which is to say, Nietzsche\'s genealogical
investigation (at its best, i.e., its most self-consistent) exemplifies
precisely that commitment to the affirmation of life which it
recommends, that is, to an *Ubermenschlich rapport a soi.* Process, not
product; Dionysus, not Apollo.

**[Supposedly, we do not have the right to rest "as long as
a]{.underline}** single **[child continues to suffer," because our moral
monitors have ordained that we take on the whole human race as our
responsibility.]{.underline}** We must give up family ties, friendship,
and nationality so as to honor only the universal figure of suffering
Man. **[Any struggle against oppression becomes my struggle. It does not
occur to our good apostles that there is no common denominator to these
conflicts and that justice varies from one country to another, depending
on its context.]{.underline}** I am supposed to extend myself
everywhere, and in the same day I am supposed to mobilize for Nicaragua,
the guerillas in El Salvador, mutilated Moslem women, and vivisected
cats, dogs, and mice, without forgetting the latest strike in a Parisian
factory or some demand students have hurled at their professors.
**[Everything concerns me, and I must put myself into the midst of the
welter dying, suffering, agonized people, those in protest, the
misunderstood, and the weak. All the world is my garden, and I must tend
to it]{.underline}**. I embrace the whole gamut of affliction around the
globe, in one oceanic and inclusive emotion. I am a soldier of famine
and a soldier of God. I indignantly refuse all thought of private
pleasure. I will be on alert till the end of the world. I am a hero of
unselfishness.

**[We cannot pretend to imitate Jesus. People exist for us only in
situations where we encounter them. If course, in all our actions the
rest of the world is somehow involved and the extent of our
responsibilities is related to the dimensions of our
actions.]{.underline}** But certain people need help from us right now,
because they are our neighbors, and their expectations define our
priorities of action. **[Even if every enterprise is ultimately tied to
the rest of the human race, our solidarity is primarily local or
national]{.underline}**. What relation is there between a taxi drivers'
strike in Marseille and a demonstration by peanut farmers in the Ivory
Coast? What do road blocks put up by wine growers in southern France
have to do with the struggle of Arizona Indians against the U.S. federal
government? **[The situations are not interchangeable. If you try to be
everyone's neighbor, you will end up as nobody's neighbor. For me to
proclaim my solidarity with the sufferings of the human
race,]{.underline}** to give up friends, relatives, and fatherland for
some vague universal feeling of sympathy, **[is literally a
mockery]{.underline}**. **[It is impossible to escape one's time and
country with a wave of the hand, and the attempt to assert world
citizenship carries with it its own failure. An overblown conscience is
an empty conscience.]{.underline}**
