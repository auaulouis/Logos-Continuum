The aff's ethic of charity is self-negating -- it's just an exercise of
power

**Quain 9** (Tony, freelance writer on contemporary economic, political,
and philosophical issues, achelor of Arts in Economics from Georgetown
University and a Master of Arts in Economics from George Mason
University, author of "The Political Reference Almanac," last updated
july 13, "Nietzsche and the Welfare State,"
<http://www.tonyquain.com/philo/200611NW.shtml>) Zanezor

\"[Whether I contemplate men with benevolence or with an evil eye, I
always find them concerned with a single task ...: to do what is good
for the preservation of the human race]{.underline}. Not from any
feeling of love for the race, but merely [because nothing in them is
older, stronger, more inexorable and unconquerable than this
instinct]{.underline}---because [this instinct constitutes the essence
of our species]{.underline}, our herd.\"1

With this grand assertion, the 19th century German philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche opens Book I of The Gay Science, a work encompassing most of
his influential ideas on morality, religion, and man and society. But
does the preservation of the species imply the need to ensure the
preservation of every individual? Even if it did, does Nietzsche believe
that this primal instinct has served man well? Is there a basic human
dignity that demands that our herd take care of all of its members?

What does Nietzsche have to contribute to our understanding of the
charity and benevolence of a political society? Specifically, would
Nietzsche favor or oppose a generous, redistributive welfare state? I
shall argue that in his writing [**[Nietzsche]{.mark} makes it quite
clear that he [would oppose state redistribution]{.mark} of wealth**,
both [from the point of view of those from whom wealth is taken
and]{.mark} those to whom it is [given]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 [While he
does not in The Gay Science directly confront or discuss the merits of
welfare politics, [his views on pity]{.mark}]{.underline}, benevolence,
dignity, morality, equality, pain, and happiness [all [contribute to a
**mosaic quite contemptuous of charity and its motives and
consequences**]{.mark}. Nietzsche would [reject the welfare state as
being]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the same time, [both weak [submission to
self-negating morality and]{.mark} a **[projection of power of]{.mark}
the [strong over]{.mark} the [weak]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Nietzsche\'s approach is individualistic. While he often speaks of the
origins, development, and ails of society in general, his writing is
nowhere intended to sway the designs or designers of the collective; he
directs his attention always to the individual as an individual.
Following this style, the evidence of his rejection of the welfare state
shall be presented as the admonitions he dispenses to three kinds of
people3: the Benefactor, who gives what he has to assist those in need;
the Moralist, who demands that others do the same; and the Recipient,
who accepts the charity of others or the manna of a compassionate state.
The argument will conclude with a possible alternative Nietzsche offers
to the welfare state.

[The [Benefactor is]{.mark} held up [for contempt]{.mark} mainly
[because]{.mark} his [acts originate from]{.mark} a contemptible feeling
of [pity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout The Gay Science, Nietzsche
makes clear that [pity is [an enervating emotion of the
weak-willed]{.mark}.]{.underline} [\"What is needful is not pity for
\[the evil and unhappy\]. [We must learn to abandon this **arrogant
fancy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"4 Further, he admires the absence of
pity: \"At times, [[our strengths propel us so far forward that we can
no longer endure our weaknesses]{.mark} and perish from them ... Thus
[we become hard against everything in us that desires consideration, and
our greatness is also our lack of compassion]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"5
**[[Pity is]{.mark} also [tied directly to a notion of
charity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as when he says, \"[Indeed, [those
who]{.mark} now [preach]{.mark} the [morality of pity]{.mark} even [take
the view that]{.mark} precisely this and [only this is moral---**to lose
one\'s own way** in order to come to the assistance of a
neighbor]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"6 Those who give of themselves out of
pity simply do not deserve our respect.

While Nietzsche often singles out pity as a deplorable affection,
virtues of self-negation in general are held in low regard. \"[[I do not
like negative]{.mark} virtues---**[virtues whose very essence is
to]{.mark} negate and [deny oneself something]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"7
Also: \"**[\'[Selflessness\' has no value]{.mark} either [in heaven
or]{.mark} on [earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"8 **[[Benevolence is
thoroughly linked]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Nietzsche\'s mind [[to
self-negation]{.mark}, as [when he cries \"No altruism!\" and]{.mark}
then [describes people who desire to be a **\"function\" of someone else
and**]{.mark} **thus [fail to live for
themselves.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Yet even as he pours derision on self-negation and pity, Nietzsche does
not deny that these feelings have personal utility, even if they are
misplaced. Pity moves us to take possession of the pitiful, to exert
power over them. \"[[When we see somebody suffer, we like to exploit
this opportunity]{.mark} to take possession of him; those who become his
benefactors and pity him ... do this ... [and the pleasure they feel is
comparable to that aroused by the prospect of a new
conquest]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}10 This makes it less clear that
selfless virtues such as pity do not hold some positive value for the
individual.

When Nietzsche says, \"[[Benefiting and hurting others are ways of
exercising one\'s power upon others]{.mark}; that is all one desires in
such cases]{.underline},\"11 he [[extends power as a motivation]{.mark}
not just [for those who are charitable]{.mark}**, but [also for those
who would redistribute wealth from benefactors]{.mark} (willing or
unwilling) [to recipients]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Hurting unwilling
benefactors through taxation and benefiting poor recipients
through]{.underline}]{.mark} [public [welfare]{.mark} spending
ultimately [serves the power instincts of those who may be
neither]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here [we are speaking of the
Moralist.]{.underline}

For Nietzsche, [[there is no special place for humans in nature]{.mark}
and no minimum acceptable human condition]{.underline}. He claims that
[[we should \"remove]{.mark} humanity, humaneness, and [\'human
dignity]{.mark}]{.underline}.\'\"12 Indeed, [he [sees the Moralist
as]{.mark} too involved, [too caring of others**, too unconcerned for
the self**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [\"I do not want to wage war against
what is ugly ... Looking away shall be my only
negation]{.underline}.\"13 Ultimately [[Nietzsche wants the Moralist to
reserve judgment for others and]{.mark} instead [look to
oneself]{.mark}. In his criticism of the Kantian categorical
imperative]{.underline} and \'universal laws,\' [he counters,
\"[We]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[want to become]{.mark} those we
are---human [beings who are new, unique]{.mark}, incomparable, who give
themselves laws, [who create themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"14 [He
seeks a moral anarchy, which by extension appears to imply political
anarchy]{.underline}. Indeed, he proclaims that [[the message of]{.mark}
\"\'equal rights,\' [\'a free society,\' \'no more masters and no
servants\'\" has no allure. \"We simply do not consider it desirable
that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth,\"
since this would be the \"realm of the deepest
leveling]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"15 While this does not conclusively
determine that Nietzsche believed in total anarchy, [it does show that
with specific regard to notions of equality he is strongly disposed to
anarchy and opposed to all order and leveling.]{.underline}

**This obsession with assisting others turns the case and destroys
humanity**

**Bruckner 86** (Pascal, Associate professor, [Institut d'Études
Politiques de
Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_d%E2%80%99%C3%89tudes_Politiques_de_Paris))
[The Tears of the White Man]{.underline}, p.66-68 //WLT

That is the wellspring of [this religion of compassionate
sympathy]{.underline}, which [strives to outdo itself with regard to
everything that lives, suffers, and feels-]{.underline}from West African
peasants to baby seals, to Amnesty International prisoners and
fur-bearing animals that have been skinned to warm the shoulders of
elegant ladies. [The [glorification of benevolent impulses is "an
instinctive morality]{.mark} that has no head, but appears to be
[composed]{.mark} only [of a heart and helping
hands]{.mark},"]{.underline} as Nietzsche said. [It is [a glorification
chanted day and night]{.mark} by the media]{.underline}, press,
politicians, and literary and artistic personalities, and it wallows in
the most bastardized form of Christianity.

[This]{.underline} religion [affliction says that [**you have to suffer
from life as if it were sickness.** As long as]{.mark} men are dying,
[children are hungry]{.mark},]{.underline} or prisons are full[, [no one
has the right to be happy]{.mark}. It is a]{.underline} categorical
[imperative that imposes on us the [duty to love man in the
abstract]{.mark}, preferably [when]{.mark} he is [far
away]{.mark}.]{.underline} Exactly as Jesus said that the poor are our
masters, [Third-Worldists make the suffering of the countries of the
Southern hemisphere into a kind of virtuous model.]{.underline} These
tropical lands are beloved because of their failings and their want, and
hunger and evil are simultaneously fought, but subtly enhanced. [This is
the [deep ambiguity]{.mark} from which the Catholic Church has never
escaped, and]{.underline} it is [the same one [that **contaminates all
organizations providing assistance**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the Third
World. [Even where suffering does not exist, it has to be created, and
where it exists, it has to be accentuated]{.underline}. Everywhere, [the
[worship of doom requires that we uphold the principal of
universal]{.mark} human [suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course,
epidemics, [[wars]{.mark} and millions of children with empty stomachs
[are intolerable]{.mark}]{.underline}, because my fellow man is my
brother. [[But]{.mark} such pain is]{.underline} also [[necessary,
because a world without misfortune]{.mark} is one that [has taken the
place of heaven]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In this way, [people are put in the service of]{.underline} the poor,
but also in the service of [poverty]{.underline}, of sacrifice itself.
[[There must be homeless]{.underline}]{.mark} people and orphans [[upon
whom our liberalism can be practiced]{.underline}]{.mark} to remind us
constantly that "my Kingdom is not of this world," and to make all joy
suspect. [As appeals for solidarity are made, the blows of misfortune
are celebrated, because they are pretexts for humility.]{.underline} At
a time when the Church, through its most qualified spokesmen, is
questioning the ambivalence of Christian charity, it is the
laity-usually Marxists- who are reviving its most dubious reflexes. [To
take the most oppressed as a measure,]{.underline} as our good
Samaritans do, [is to imply]{.underline} that [suffering and
death]{.underline} are not just failures of an unjust worldwide economic
system, but [are also part "of the immemorial drama of our relation to
the Creator]{.underline}." [It means]{.underline} that, far from being
abominable and outrageous, [the [oppressed embellish and typify the
human condition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This bottomless pit of suffering becomes the tribunal,]{.underline} the
supreme court that admonishes the privileged and leisured members of the
human race. The fact that people are wallowing in rags and mud
strengthens the indictment of silk and ermine. [The intolerable disorder
of the world is constantly underlined, the eye of an avenging God is
cast on it, and he watches over it and endlessly enumerates its
weaknesses and faults. The West is satanized and the Third World becomes
fixed in its role of the persecuted, the better to show that no
compromise at all is possible between them]{.underline}, aside from the
infinite repentance of the West.

With a remarkable talent for spotting every ethnic group, or others who
have been subject to persecution in some way[, the world is searched for
sadness, bad luck and misfortune. An obscene joy lists the millions of
alarms ringing in the world, and a sort of [morbid delight is taken in
the **systematic ruin** of the]{.mark} thousands of forms of life on the
[globe]{.mark}. Such liberals are like hemophiliacs in love with human
suffering, ready to bleed for any case]{.underline}; they are the
professional mourners of modern history. They have no sooner dried their
tears when a new subject for lamentation makes them start weeping anew.
[Failures and distress are collected because they serve as a clear
warning-you have enjoyed yourselves too much]{.underline}, you have
wasted too much. You must prepare yourselves for abstinence, chastity,
and a return to the land. Hunger in the world is the punishment for our
own European sinfulness. Supermarkets, naked women, homosexuality, paper
money, Coca Cola- all these are the corruptors of the healthy young of
the underdeveloped world. The theme of atonement used to be one of the
political Right, but it is now that of the Left. It is a miraculous
reconciliation of the ashes of Marshal Petain and Lenin's tomb under the
patronage of a weeping Jesus Christ of Naples.

**Alternative: Vote Negative to reject the affirmative truth claims in
favor of complete nihilism.**

**This halts our drive for perfection fostering a vibrant humanity**

**White 90** (Alan, Professor of Philosophy at Williams College, "Within
Nietzsche's Labrynth," 1990,
<http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/faculty/awhite/WNL%20web/WNL%20contents.htm>
) //WLT

All of this suggests that radical nihilism remains \"something to be
overcome.\" The questions arise: by whom, and how? A passage already
introduced provides a hint concerning the first: w[hat I have been
calling radical nihilism results when \"all one has left are the values
that pass judgment.\"]{.underline} This sug­gests that [one for whom
those values have \"devalued themselves\" must be left with nothing at
all]{.underline}. Etymologically, [it would cer­tainly make sense to call
such a person a \"nihilist.\"]{.underline} In addi­tion, Nietzsche
suggests that [[one who is left with nothing]{.underline}]{.mark} in
this manner [[has gained rather than lost]{.mark}:]{.underline} [[in
denying]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the world requires
[\"purpose]{.mark}]{.underline},\" \"unity,\" or \"truth\" [[of]{.mark}
the sort posited by [religious nihilists]{.mark} and despaired of by
radical nihilists, [one may regain the world of becoming in its original
innocence]{.mark}:]{.underline}

one cannot judge, measure, compare, or even deny the whole! Why not? \--
For five reasons, all accessible even to modest intel­lects; for example,
because there is nothing besides the whole \[weil es nichts gibt ausser
dem Ganzen\]. \[\...\] And, once again, this is a tremendous
restorative, for herein lies the innocence of all existence. (N:15\[30\]
/ WP:765; cf. TIVI:8)

The Nietzschean term that suggests itself for the resulting position is
\"complete \[vollendeter\] nihilism,\" but this term must be used with
care. I take it from Nietzsche\'s description of him­self as \"Europe\'s
first complete nihilist, who, however, has him­self already lived
nihilism through to its end, within himself \-- who has it behind him,
beneath him, outside of him\" (N:11\[411\] / WP:P). The wording of this
passage indicates that Nietzsche, al­though Europe\'s first complete
nihilist, is no longer a nihilist. I will nevertheless characterize this
position as \"complete nihilism\" in the sense of completed nihilism,
nihilism that has been lived through entirely, \"the logic of our great
values and ideals, thought through to its end\" (N:11\[411\] / WP:P).

[My use of the term receives some justification from Nietzsche\'s claim
of having brought nihilism to its end, albeit only within himself; its
advent within the world at large, he tells us, is to dominate \"the
history of the next two centuries.\"]{.underline} Following those two
centuries, \"in some future or other,\" t[here will be a
countermovement, a transvaluation, that will \"absolve
\[]{.underline}ablö sen\] [this complete nihilism\"]{.underline}
(N:11\[411\] / WP:P). [If Nietzsche cannot accomplish this
transvaluation, he can]{.underline} at least [foresee it]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} thereby, within himself, [bring nihilism to its end;
but, again, he can be aware of doing so]{.underline}, can be aware that
the end is end, only if he is beyond the end, [only if he sees that what
fol­lows the end is no longer nihilism. [One is a complete nihilist only
when one has completed nihilism, thereby ceasing to be a
nihilist]{.mark}.]{.underline} And indeed, [[in the continuation of the
passage defining nihilism as the condition of one who has left only
\"the values that pass judgment \-- nothing else,\" Nietzsche
describes]{.mark} the \"[problem of strength and weakness\" in terms
that]{.mark} clearly [place]{.mark} the [strongest beyond]{.mark} the
so-defined [nihilism:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[(1) the [weak collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}

[(2) the [stronger destroy what does not]{.mark} collapse;]{.underline}

[(3) the strongest overcome the values that pass judgment.]{.underline}
(N:9\[107\] / WP:37)

[The religious nihilist,]{.underline} unlike the radical nihilist,
denies being a nihilist; what about the complete nihilist? Certainly,
the latter acknowledges that our world does not correspond to the
traditional \"highest values,\" and that we \"have no right\" to any
other world; but this acknowledgment is paired with the denial that any
other world \"ought to be,\" and that our \"world of becoming\" ought
not to be. [For the complete nihilist, denigrating the world for its
lack of purpose is as senseless as denigrating a philosophical treatise
for its lack of plot, a symphony for its lack of text, or a painting for
representing, rather than containing, motion or depth.]{.underline} In
non-Nietzschean terms: [the [complete nihilist considers nihilism itself
to be the result of a category mistake]{.mark}. The complete nihilist
thus [returns to a position abandoned with the step to religious
nihilism]{.mark}: the complete nihilist \"deifies becoming and the
apparent world as the only world, and calls them good\"]{.underline}
(N:9\[60\] / WP:585).

Active celebration of individual life avoids their debasement of
humanity

**Celtel 5** (Andre, Professor @ Institute of Social and Cultural
Anthropology at Oxford, "Categories of Self, " 187-8, google books)
Zanezor

A great deal of what Kierkegaard stood for was undone in the latter half
of the nineteenth century by Nietzsche (1844---19(X)). In particular.
Klerkegaard's [idealisation of]{.underline} the religious life, his high
estimation of Christian [[self-denial, finds little resonance]{.mark} In
Nietzsche]{.underline}'s hypercritical philosophy. For the latter, [It
is the [aesthetic life]{.mark} that [Is favoured]{.mark} ---
[freedom]{.mark}, if anywhere, is to be found [in]{.mark} expressive,
creative. Independent [individuals, giving free reign to their emotions,
to their Intrinsic 'will to power']{.mark}]{.underline}. While
Kierkcgaard hoped to salvage Christianity from the absurdities of
Christendom, Nietzsche's attitude is far more damning: [[Christianity
amounts to a **deep-seated debasement of**]{.mark} **that [human ideal
that finds its highest expression in purely aesthetic
values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Kenny 1988: 301). According to Nietzsche,
the [history of [Western morality should be read as]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[reversal]{.mark} or 'transvaluatlon' of two distinct moralities.
In place [of a 'master-morality' espoused by]{.mark} the
[powerful]{.mark}]{.underline} or noble, the ruling elite, one [[that
emphasizes]{.mark} strength, bravery. riches. luxury an overall **[zest
for life]{.mark}**]{.underline}[:]{.mark} in place of this, [a
'slave-morality', that of the lowly and disappointed, had gained
ascendancy]{.underline}. This **['[slave-' or 'herd-morality' puts a
premium on]{.mark} character traits befitting [the underdog]{.mark}.
[traits such]{.mark} as solidarity. humility, self-denial, tolerance,
and [benevolence]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- the Christian gospel of love
Is among Its most exemplary expressions. [[What
motivates]{.underline}]{.mark} Christianity [[Is]{.mark} not a selfless.
spiritual piety, **but [a deep resentment]{.mark}, a spirit of revenge
--- '[the meek shall inherit the earth' --- against those who are
stronger]{.mark}, happier, more noble, and powerful**]{.underline}.
Christianity encourages a view of worldly existence as empty and
unfulfilling. It [[points to the]{.mark} vanity of even the greatest
earthly accomplishments, the worthlessness of luxury and ambition, the
inherent [evil concealed in power]{.mark}, wealth, and excessive
leisure]{.underline}. In short. Christianity
[[denies]{.underline}]{.mark}, transvaluates, [all those [things enjoyed
by the master class]{.mark} and unattainable to slaves]{.underline} ---
**[it [breeds contempt, even disdain, for life]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Solomon 1988: 115---22). [Vulgarity and [mediocrity]{.mark} arc [the
modern ideal]{.mark}s: modern [man is hardly a man at
all]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nietzsche's philosophy Is thoroughly this-worldly and Individualistic.
In his view, [to Impose a single universal standard. a categorical
Imperative. Is to limit those with the greatest talents and abilities,
to level out society to the **lowest common denominator**. Rational
[universal imperatives deny]{.mark} those [inclinations and instinctual
promptings that **lie at the very heart of what it is to be**]{.mark}
**a [human]{.mark} being**. [Any imposition]{.mark} of universal
standards [equates to a morality of the masses]{.mark}, of the weak and
downtrodden. Opposed to this pitiable leveling out of humanity.
[Nietzsche encourages a masterly morality]{.mark}]{.underline}, one
[[that places individual excellence and creativity above obedience and
social conformity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Christianity, like [all
metaphysical escape from this world, places the **greatest obstacle** to
the fulfilment of human life.]{.underline} The '[[death of God'
should]{.mark} thus [be celebrated]{.mark}, since]{.underline} once
again those **[[basic instincts that have always been an essential part
of humankind can freely and creatively resurface]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The [most fundamental of these Is the 'will to power', the secret of all
existence]{.underline}, even of non-human life. [Every living thing
strives to fulfill its potential, to discharge its essential
life-force]{.underline}. in the realm of humanity. the [[will to power
Is the power of]{.mark} great souls, of artists, of [**self-sufficient
and self-confident individuals**, of a creative and expressive

Suffering is inevitable -- we must fully embrace it without a middle
ground

Our Attitude Towards Suffering Be," Nietzsche and Suffeirng- A Choice of

We have now come back to our original question. I said at the beginning
of this paper that I would try to answer it indirectly by looking at two
different ways of giving suffering meaning. The first way involved the
ascetic ideal, which turned out to be a mendacious and deleterious
means. [Correlated with the ascetic ideal is the idea that suffering is
to be avoided as far as possible: suffering is undesirable.]{.underline}
But **[[while it is undesirable, it is ultimately unavoidable]{.mark}.
But [worse than not being able to avoid suffering is not being able to
see it as meaningful]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [[ascetic ideal
provided]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
essentially that [we suffer [as punishment]{.mark} for our sins;
however, **this turns out to [actually increase]{.mark} our [suffering
through]{.mark} our [intense]{.mark} feelings of
[guilt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At first the guilt acts as a narcotic for
our suffering, but it ultimately gives way to more suffering. The
[[unavoidability]{.mark} of suffering, and the mendaciousness and
deleteriousness of the ascetic ideal and its associated idea that
suffering is undesirable]{.underline}, I take as **[[evidence that our
attitude toward suffering should not be one of
avoidance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Further, I [[take]{.mark} the [life
enhancing attributes]{.mark} of suffering [and its subsequent
meaningfulness]{.mark} coupled with the eternal recurrence [to be a
positive alternative]{.mark} ideal. It is an ideal [that involves the
wholehearted embracing of]{.mark} one's [suffering]{.mark}, an attitude
that seeks not to avoid suffering]{.underline}, but to see it as
necessary and an opportunity for growth and strengthening. This I take
to be evidence that our attitude toward suffering should not be one of
avoidance. However, [when I say that our attitude toward suffering
should be one of embracement and not avoidance, [I do not]{.mark} mean
to [suggest that we not try to avoid sickness]{.mark} or]{.underline}
pain. Rather, the idea is that [[while we should neither seek out
suffering nor]{.mark} never seek to [circumvent it, when it does happen
we should not bemoan]{.mark} or lament [our situation]{.mark}, but seek
to embrace it as an opportunity for enhancing]{.underline} ourselves [in
some way]{.underline}. At the same time, however, **[we should not try
to make things too easy]{.underline}** for ourselves, for it is harsh
conditions that make strong; in this sense we should seek great
responsibilities and take much upon ourselves.

There is a problem, however. We have seen that this alternative ideal is
not open to all. There are some, the lower types, who are predisposed to
suffer poorly. What should they do? Presumably they should stick with
the ascetic ideal; however, I am reluctant to suggest that anyone stick
with something mendacious and deleterious. This leads to an important
question that I must leave unaddressed: is it possible for a lower type
to struggle to become a higher type? From what we have seen, Nietzsche
probably would say no; but while a lower type, because of his natural
capacities, may not be able to become one of the highest types, I do not
see why he would not be able to become a type higher than before.
Further, insofar as there is truth to what I have argued, it will have
profound implications for ethics: for example, in how we ought to treat
others, in particularly how we ought to respond to the suffering of
children and the sick.

I said at the beginning of the paper that **[[there is not a middle
position between the two ideals]{.mark} available]{.underline}**. That
is, **[the [attitude of avoiding suffering as far as possible and
embracing it when]{.mark} it actually [does happen, as it inevitably
must, is not]{.mark}]{.underline}** really **[[a
possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is because [[to]{.mark} really
[adopt the]{.mark}]{.underline} Nietzschean
[[alt]{.mark}ernative]{.underline} ideal, as I have tried to spell it
out, **[[is not compatible with trying to avoid
suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}** as far as possible, for reasons already
given. Again this does not mean that one does not avoid an oncoming car
or that one blithely walks into a pit of snakes.

Their appeal to compassion is more dangerous than pity -- we should help
the poor without identifying with their weaknesses or risk negative life

**Tevenar 5** (Gurdren von, Prof of Philosophy @ Birkbeck University,
"Nietzsche's Objections to Pity and Compassion,"
<http://www.bbk.ac.uk/phil/staff/academics/gemes-work/GurdrenvonTevenar18Oct05>)
Zanezor

Regarding the question whether Nietzsche truly believed that mere pity
is all there is to *Mitleid,* one must concede that much speaks for such
a conclusion since, as we have seen, most of the objections put forward
by Nietzsche against *Mitleid* apply to *Mitleid* understood merely as
pity and not as compassion. Because of this [some
commentators]{.underline} and translators [believe that pity is all
there is to Nietzsche's Mitleid and thus to doubt that Nietzsche had any
inkling of the existence and power of compassion.]{.underline} In what
follows I will argue that [[Nietzsche was aware of]{.mark} the existence
of [compassion and]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} indeed, [**[feared its
power]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[Let us focus]{.underline} again [on the difference]{.underline} between
pity and compassion [with the help of Nietzsche's own words. Zarathustra
declares]{.underline} \[part II: *Of the Pitiers*\]:

[But I am a giver: gladly give I as a friend to friends. But strangers
and the poor may help themselves to the fruit of my trees: it shames
less that way.]{.underline} Let us leave aside the question of shame and
concentrate solely on the attitude of the speaker who describes himself
as a giver. He gladly gives to friends -- presumably out of friendship
-- and also gives to strangers and the poor -- presumably out of
*Mitleid.* So [Zarathustra gives to both, but note the difference in his
attitude towards them! With the first group Zarathustra identifies
because of the bond of friendship]{.underline}, he is attentive to them
as someone like himself -- as a friend to friends. But the second group,
[the strangers]{.underline} and poor, [he keeps at a distance, a
distance defined by their condition of strangeness and
poverty.]{.underline} [This is precisely the distance we have earlier
defined as characteristic of the attitude of pity.]{.underline} It
separates the needy by defining them -- as with a label -- by their
condition of strangeness and poverty thus failing to attend to them as
persons, as someone like oneself. One consequence of keeping strangers
and the poor in this way separate and at a distance is that, after
opening the gates to one's orchard, nothing stops one now from happily
continuing one's own pursuits such as, perhaps, feasting with one's
friends while the needy are away in the orchard.

Contrast this with what Nietzsche writes in *On the Genealogy of Morals*
\[III:14\] where he speaks of the danger the weak pose for the strong as
well as of the danger of *'*great *Mitleid'.* [Nietzsche informs us that
'[the failed]{.mark}, downcast, and broken' are the ones 'who [most
dangerously poison]{.mark} and call into question [our
confidence]{.mark} in life, in man, in ourselves'. And so [he
warns]{.mark} us [against]{.mark} what he calls '[the conspiracy of the
sufferers]{.mark}' and against a time [when the
weakest]{.mark}]{.underline}....

....**[[might succeed in shoving]{.mark} their own misery, [all
misery]{.mark} generally [into the conscience of the
happy]{.mark}:]{.underline}** so that [they would one day begin to be
ashamed of their happiness and perhaps say to each other: 'it is a
disgrace to be happy]{.underline}! there is too much misery! \[my
translation\] But [how do the weak manage to shove their misery into the
conscience of the happy]{.underline}?

They do it by inducing in them 'great *Mitleid'.* [[It
begins]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Nietzsche, [[with]{.mark} the
'[veiled look' in the eyes of the wretched which produces]{.mark} in the
strong [a 'deep sadness']{.mark}]{.underline}. Nietzsche eloquently
describes that 'veiled look' as a dangerous mixture of pain and secret
resentment: [dangerous, because the resultant 'deep sadness' is just the
beginning. For Nietzsche predicts that this sadness [will eventually
grow into guilt]{.mark} and shame [until]{.mark}, in the end, [the
happy]{.mark} begin to [doubt their very right to happiness]{.mark} in
face of 'too much misery'.]{.underline} In other words, the misery and
wretchedness of the weak has potentially serious consequences for the
strong inasmuch as it undermines their hitherto unquestioned confidence
in the superior value of themselves and their lives. Please note that
the objection to *Mitleid* in the *Genealogy* \[III;14\] is also of the
detrimental-to-givers kind, but, unlike Zarathustra earlier, the agent
now experiences and succumbs to 'great *Mitleid',* and is thus unable to
simply cleanse herself of its effect by 'washing her hands and wiping
her soul'. The difference between the attitude of Zarathustra and
Nietzsche's description of 'great *Mitleid'* in the *Genealogy* captures
an important difference between pity and compassion. Remember the
description of pity as agent distress at the suffering of others. There
is ample everyday evidence that the distress of pity generally leads to
action that relieves, at one and the same time, both the suffering of
others and the distress of agents. This is precisely the case with
Zarathustra: feeling pity for the hungry, he opens the gates of his
orchard \[or makes a credit card donation\] thus relieving the hungry
and his own distress. And now he can switch off, as it were, and
continue untroubled with his previous lifestyle. Not so, however, with
the agent Nietzsche describes in the *Genealogy*! Having looked deeply
into the eyes of the wretched, that agent now experiences a 'deep
sadness'; a sadness, furthermore, which Nietzsche believes will
eventually undermine her previous enjoyment and affirmation of life. In
other words, [after looking deep in the [eyes of pain]{.mark}, even if
they [also harbour secret resentment]{.mark}, things no longer remain
the same, since the agent is now troubled by doubt about her previously
unquestioned right to happiness, unsettled by the thought that 'it is a
disgrace to be happy]{.underline}! *there is too much misery!'* So,
unlike Zarathustra, this agent will be unable to merrily feast with her
friends while the hungry are away in the orchard.

So what is the difference? The difference is that Zarathustra feels
*Mitleid* merely as pity while the [**[deeply sad agent feels]{.mark}
what Nietzsche calls ['great Mitleid']{.mark}, which we [can]{.mark} now
[confidently translate as compassion]{.mark}**. By allowing the pain of
others to move her in such a way as [to feel solidarity with them, this
agent bridges the gap of separation]{.mark} and otherness by
acknowledging them as persons with whom she has a common bond. That very
acknowledgement [prevents her now from continuing to enjoy]{.mark} the
kind of untroubled outlook that Nietzsche believes is]{.underline} - and
wants to maintain as - **[[the birthright of the
strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, [that acknowledgement also
[initiates the]{.mark} dreaded [slide into degeneration]{.mark}, since
Nietzsche believed that once tempted by 'great Mitleid' to succumb to
sadness and feelings of guilt, [the agent has
forfeited]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it were, her **[right to [membership
of the strong for she]{.mark} now [identifies with miserable members of
the herd]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And I suggest that [this very [power to
tempt the strong to identify with the weak]{.mark}, thus subverting
confidence in their own superiority, [is]{.mark} precisely [what
Nietzsche most fears]{.mark} about]{.underline} 'great *Mitleid'* or
[compassion]{.underline}. Hence the polemic, hence the passionate
rhetoric of his objections, for **[Nietzsche [certainly has no
objections to feeding the hungry]{.mark}]{.underline}**! Indeed, it
would be a mistake to conclude, as Nussbaum seems to have done, that
Nietzsche rejects feeding the hungry when he rejects *Mitleid.*
**[Feeding the hungry is [perfectly all right as long as it is done
from]{.mark} an [overflow of strength]{.mark}, from an abundance of
happiness, [and not from Mitleid]{.mark}, especially not from 'great
Mitleid' [with its temptation to identify with the weak]{.mark} thus
opening the sluice gates of degeneration]{.underline}**. \[see also

Religion and Buddhism are obsessed with abolishing suffering

Our Attitude Towards Suffering Be," Nietzsche and Suffeirng- A Choice of

Zanezor

To begin I will look at the possibility of desiring the abolishment or
minimizing of suffering. [There may be various ways that one might try
to do away with or avoid suffering, but religion provides a good if not
paradigmatic example of such a way]{.underline}. In his explication of
basic Buddhist concepts, Kogen Mizuno writes, "[The [major purpose of
all religions is to cure the illness of the spirit]{.mark} and create a
wholesome, integrated psychological condition]{.underline}...\[their\]
[major task is the essential improvement of the psychological being to
ensure spiritual health and immunity to spiritual illness]{.underline}."
There are surely those who might disagree to this being the major
project of religion; however, it is not objectionable that many turn to
religion for solace from their suffering.

[In Buddhism [we]{.mark} can most easily [find]{.mark} a direct
expression of [the notion of abolishing suffering**. At the center** of
the Buddha's teachings]{.mark} are what are usually called the four
noble truths]{.underline}: "that life is suffering, that ignorance is
the cause of suffering, that [suffering can be eliminated]{.underline},
and that the Eightfold Path is the way to eliminate suffering." The
Buddha is said to have been shaken out of his naïve view of life by
viewing the suffering of sickness, old age, and death. It was upon
seeing these that he realized the true nature of life. The [Dalai Lama
often says that all sentient beings desire happiness and freedom from
suffering. Here we find the idea that happiness and suffering are
separate; the latter interferes with the former.]{.underline} We all
want happiness, [so we all desire freedom from suffering. [Buddhism
supposedly offers a way to]{.mark} achieve this freedom---a freedom
which is ultimately to be found in enlightenment and the cessation of
the cycle of births and deaths]{.underline}; however, [Buddhism also
tries to cultivate happiness and the [cessation of
suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} caused by such things as sickness and
death even before enlightenment occurs and Nirvana is found.

Zanezor

[[None of these ponderous herd animals]{.underline}]{.mark} with their
unquiet consciences (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as
the cause of the general welfare) [[wants to know]{.mark} or even sense
[that]{.mark} "the [general welfare" is **no
ideal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, no goal, no remotely intelligible concept,
[[but only an emetic]{.underline}]{.mark}---that **[[what is fair for
one cannot]{.mark} by any means for that reason alone also [be fair for
others]{.mark}; that the [demand of one morality for all is detrimental
for the higher man]{.mark}]{.underline}**; in short, that [[there is an
order]{.mark} of rank between man and man, hence also [between
**morality and morality.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is a great deal going on in this passage. Nietzsche is arguing
against the idea that English utilitarianism should be viewed as right
for humanity as a whole. [Nietzsche wants to make clear that a [desire
for]{.mark} a [universal morality is]{.mark} not only a bad
idea]{.underline}---because of the order of rank---**[but also a
[dangerous]{.mark} one]{.underline}**. The [morality of the ascetic
priest is dangerous to the higher type of man, [for it is the morality
of the meek]{.mark} and those that do not suffer well]{.underline}. And
a [[morality]{.mark} that would be appropriate [for the higher]{.mark}
type [would be dangerous for the lower]{.mark} type]{.underline}. Those
in the [lower ranks [**could not bear** the burden of
responsibility]{.mark} and suffering that comes with the higher
type]{.underline}. This is, in part, why Nietzsche says that a further
difference among people, one that further differentiates the order of
rank, is their table of goods (what they take to be good) and what they
take to be having something good. The higher type, for example, takes
strength, self-reverence, and the ability to bear heavy responsibility
as goods; the lower type takes timidity, humbleness, and altruistic
ideals as goods (or poverty, humility, and chastity).

Universal rights are a myth -- inequality is inevitable

Zanezor

As we have seen, [Nietzsche essentially advocates inequality.
[In]{.mark} today's world of [political correctness]{.mark}]{.underline}
and attempts by universities to push multiculturalism, [[to advocate
inequality is blasphemous]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [however distasteful
the idea might be, [we should give it a **fair
hearing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To begin, **[it is [undeniable that
humans are born with greatly unequal]{.mark} natural characteristics,
abilities, and [capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I will [not try to
list all the ways, but some]{.underline} of them [include
size,]{.underline} physical [strength, metabolism]{.underline}, genetic
predisposition to disease, eyesight, mental acuity, ability to
concentrate, general disposition, demeanor, and so on. It is true that
if you are not naturally a fast runner, you can train very hard to
improve; nevertheless, [[if]{.mark} you are [not predisposed to
being]{.mark} really [fast]{.mark} or to having great endurance,
[regardless of how hard you train, someone who is]{.mark} predisposed to
these things [will be faster]{.mark} or have greater
endurance]{.underline}.

We might be willing to acknowledge that people are physically and
psychologically different, at which point we say that though they are
different in body and mind, everyone should have equal rights and equal
opportunities. But from what we have already seen, even this is
repugnant to Nietzsche. For example, [the [higher types should]{.mark}
have the right to [rule, whereas]{.mark} the [lower types are not fit
to]{.mark}]{.underline} rule. Speaking disparagingly of those he takes
to be falsely called "free spirits" in his time, Nietzsche writes, "[the
two songs and doctrines which they repeat most often are 'equality of
rights' and 'sympathy for all that suffers'---and suffering itself they
take for something that must be abolished]{.underline}." For Nietzsche,
**[[those who want]{.mark} to guarantee [equality of rights]{.mark} and
opportunity also [want to do away with suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Their [[hearts bleed]{.mark} for the suffering and inequality that they
perceive. [They do not realize the importance]{.mark} and necessity [of
suffering]{.mark},]{.underline} Nietzsche would say. [This is not to say
that there are not actual cases where individuals are done wrong.
[Racism]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the sense, for example, of taking an
individual of one race to be boorish or stupid simply by virtue of being
of a particular race, [[can rightly be seen as doing]{.mark} that
individual [wrong]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [there is also the case
of the violation of the rights of the higher type by the lower type's
calling for equality]{.underline}:

Today...when only the herd animal receives and dispense honors in
Europe, [when "[equality of rights" could]{.mark} all to easily [be
changed into]{.mark} equality in violating rights]{.underline}---I mean,
**[into a common [war on all that is rare]{.mark}, strange, privileged,
the [higher man]{.mark}, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher
responsibility, [and]{.mark} the [abundance of creative power and
masterfulness]{.mark}]{.underline}**....[Equal rights]{.underline}, when
preached by the lower type, **[[mean]{.mark} the [violation of the
higher type's rights, since]{.mark} the equal [rights preached by the
lower]{.mark} type [are befitting the lower]{.mark} type
[alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Kaufman writes:

In our time...equality is confused with conformity---as Nietzsche sees
it---and it is taken to involve the renunciation of personal initiative
and the demand for general leveling. [[Men are losing]{.mark} the
[ambition to be equally excellent]{.mark}, which involves as the surest
means the desire to excel one another in continued competition, and they
are [becoming resigned to]{.mark} being equally [mediocre]{.mark}.
Instead of vying for distinction, men nurture a ressentiment against all
that is distinguished, superior, or strange.]{.underline}

[Wanting equal rights is a mark of shallowness]{.underline}---[[such a
shallow thinker fails to see the depth of distinctions that lie in human
natures]{.underline}]{.mark}. A great many people easily feel nervous
when they see others excel; they do not like to be reminded that they
are not equal. This can be seen in certain initiatives to do away with
grades in school---the general desire by some to spare children, if not
adults, the feeling of not being as good as someone else.

#  Impact: Extinction {#impact-extinction .Block-Title}

Compassion causes extinction -- it paralyzes progress

**Frazer 6** (Michael, Ph.D in political philosophy from Princeton,
postdoctoral research associate in the Political Theory Project at Brown
University. Proferssor of Enlightenment polyphi @ Harvard, "On
Nietzschean Ethnic: The Compassion of Zarathuras: Nietzsche of Sympathy
and Strength,"
<http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=421638>)
Zanezor

These are all strong arguments against compassion, to be sure. But
Nietzsche insists that there is still "a more important one. . . . Quite
in general, [[compassion]{.underline}]{.mark} \[das Mitleiden\]
[crosses]{.underline} the law of development, which is [the law of
selection]{.underline}. It [[preserves what is **ripe for
destruction**]{.mark}, it defends those who have been disinherited and
condemned by life"]{.underline} (AC 7, p. 573).35 The eugenic argument
against compassion is a direct extension of the medical nature of
Nietzschean ethics. "[**[Life itself]{.underline}** [recognizes
no]{.underline}]{.mark} [solidarity, no ['equal rights,' between]{.mark}
the [healthy and]{.mark} the [degenerate parts of an organism: one must
excise the latter---**or the whole will perish**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Nietzsche explains. As a result, ["[Compassion for]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[Mitleiden mit\] [decadents, equal rights for the
[ill-constituted]{.mark}]{.underline}---that **[[would be the
profoundest immorality]{.mark}; that would be [antinature]{.mark} itself
[as morality]{.mark}]{.underline}**!" (WM 734, p. 389). The [[physician
to humanity]{.mark}, in order [to save it]{.mark} from its degenerate
parts, [must]{.mark} therefore first [play physician to the individual
psyche]{.mark}, for it is the [compassion]{.mark} in the individual that
[feeds the degeneracy in the collective.]{.mark}]{.underline} "To be
physicians here, [t[o wield the scalpel]{.mark}]{.underline} here,"
Nietzsche explains, "that [[is]{.mark} our part]{.underline}; that is
**[[our love of man]{.underline}]{.mark}**; that is how we are
philosophers" (AC 7, p. 574).

Even this eugenic view, however, fails to capture the full danger of
compassion, for it portrays the weak and sickly who are its objects as
mere passive recipients of aid. To the contrary, [[compassion is]{.mark}
**actively [wielded as a weapon]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [hands of the
weak]{.mark}. For the most degenerate]{.underline} of the degenerate,
[it is the one weapon they have left, [the one last strength]{.mark}
which shows that they are still alive as manifestations of the will to
power. **[They]{.mark} therefore [wield]{.mark} compassion [with
relish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When the weak beg the strong for
sympathy, "[the compassion]{.underline} \[Das Mitleiden\]
[which]{.underline} these \[[the strong\] then express is a consolation
for the weak and suffering]{.underline}, inasmuch as it shows them that,
all their weakness notwithstanding, [they possess]{.underline} at any
rate [one power: the power to hurt]{.underline}" (MAM I:50, p. 39). The
[[result is not only]{.mark} the **[objective degeneration of
humanity]{.mark}** over the generations, [but]{.mark} also a
**[subjective]{.mark}** sense of [shame on]{.mark} the part of [those
who remain strong]{.mark}]{.underline}. Full power over another,
remember, is control over his values. [The ultimate victory of the
slaves over the masters thus comes when they have "succeeded in
poisoning the consciences of the fortunate with their own
misery]{.underline}, with all misery, [so that one day the fortunate
begin to be ashamed of their good fortune and perhaps say to one
another: 'it is disgraceful to be fortunate: there is too much
misery']{.underline}" (GM III:14, p. 560).

They deny human vitality -- we need to embrace strength

**Porter 1** (Burton, prof of Philosophy at Amherst, "The Good Life,"

[[Nietzsche singled out]{.mark} democracy. socialism, and Christianity
as oppressive forces]{.underline}, lie [regarded democracy and socialism
as [**enemies of the vital spirit of humanity because they maintain
that** all]{.mark} people [are equal and should have]{.mark} the [same
**proportion of**]{.mark} **the worlds [goods]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
an equal voice in government; the [[idea of someone being
Superior]{.mark} and entitled to greater consideration [is anathema to

means that bourgeois morality will carry the day 'We do not take a vote

but oddly enough [we allow]{.mark} the [masses to decide the social

arc allowed to rule]{.mark} our social existence.**]{.underline}

[Nietzsche criticized Christianity]{.underline} on similar grounds, for
[it seems [in league with everything that is]{.mark} common and
[timid]{.mark}]{.underline}. To Nietzsche's mind, [Christianity [favors
humility and self-denial]{.mark}, pacifism, conservatism, and mutual
helpfulness]{.underline}. This is [**[a manifestation of herd
morality]{.mark}** which Christianity reflects and supports, and it is
founded on weakness rather than strength. Christians are [merely
extolling their own inadequacies and transforming them into virtues
because they do not have the courage to assert
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. They **[[believe the meek shall
inherit]{.mark} the earth [because they lack]{.mark} the strength of

religion of pity," Nietzsche wrote, and [[pity stands opposed to]{.mark}
the tonic [emotions which heighten our vitality]{.mark}; it [has a
depressing effect]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[(and) makes suffering
contagious]{.underline}**]{.mark}. .. . In Christianity the [instincts
of the subjugated and oppressed come to the fore: here the lowest
classes seek their salvation]{.underline}. Christian too is [mortal
enmity against the lords of the earth, against the
"noble]{.underline}"---along with a sly, secret rivalry (one leaves them
the body, one wants only the "soul"). Christian, finally, is [[the

[Nietzsche thought Christianity not only antivital hut distracting in
that it draws people's attention **away from real issues of human
progress and personal growth.**]{.underline} Like Marx. he did not want
to understand the world so much as to change it, and [Christianity stood
in the way as a conservative force that persuades people to pin their

The aff's motivations delink humanity from pleasure and value -- worsens
the problem

and philosophical issues, achelor of Arts in Economics from Georgetown
University and a Master of Arts in Economics from George Mason
University, author of "The Political Reference Almanac," last updated

Although Nietzsche has been shown to offer much disdain for benefactors
and moralists, **[it is [the Recipient]{.mark} who he believes [is
harmed most by charitable intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
[arises out of a fundamental misunderstanding of human
happiness.]{.underline}

**[[Discomfort and displeasure are necessary for]{.mark} us to
experience and appreciate [true pleasure]{.mark} and true
happiness:]{.underline}**

[\"To this day [you have the choice: either]{.mark} as little
displeasure as possible, [painlessness]{.mark} in
brief]{.underline}---and in the last analysis
[[socialists]{.underline}]{.mark} and politicians of all parties [[have
no right to promise their people more]{.mark} than
that]{.underline}---[[or]{.mark} as much [displeasure]{.mark} as
possible [as the price for]{.mark} the growth and [abundance of]{.mark}
subtle [pleasures]{.mark} and joys that have rarely been relished yet.
[If you]{.mark} decide]{.underline} for the former and desire [to
[diminish]{.mark} and lower the level of [human
pain]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[you]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[also [have
to diminish]{.mark} and lower the level of their [capacity for
joy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" 16 (It should be noted that [Nietzsche\'s
aside in this quote about \"socialists]{.underline} and politicians of
all parties\" [is quite instructive. It indicates that **[politics can
not increase]{.mark} our [pleasure]{.mark} but only diminish our
displeasure**]{.underline}, i.e. [only close the gap and thus **reduce
our capacity for joy**]{.underline}. This [[presents a connection
between]{.mark} Nietzsche\'s [discussion of pleasure and]{.mark} his
[views on welfare statism]{.mark}]{.underline}).

[[Without their opposites, pleasure and happiness have **no relative
value for us and no vivacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly,
[pain and misfortune provoke personal growth and evolution; loss brings
with it new and increased strength]{.underline}.17 [Those who face great
pain with pride and happiness are heroic; **\"pain itself gives them
their greatest moments**]{.underline} ... They [contribute immensely to
the preservation of the species, even if it were only by opposing
comfortableness and by not concealing how this sort of happiness
nauseates them]{.underline}.\"18 Indeed, such
[\"[comfortableness]{.mark}\" for Nietzsche [is]{.mark} vegetative, [a
retreat from life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, \"[our \'benefactors\'
are, **more than our enemies**, people who make our worth and will
smaller]{.underline}.\" In his concern for the Recipient, Nietzsche
returns to an attack on pity: \"[It is the very essence of the emotion
of pity that it strips away from the suffering of others whatever is
**distinctively personal**]{.underline}.\"19 Ironically, this appears to
be [an appeal to]{.underline} a respect for human dignity---not the
material dignity which Nietzsche disparages elsewhere (as shown), but [a
dignity of true individuality.]{.underline}

Lest Nietzsche himself show pity for the Recipient, [he reserves much of
the blame for the recipients themselves. [In receiving charity**, they
are all too willing to submit to the
stronger**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} \"Hence, [we should make a
distinction in benevolence between the impulse to appropriate and the
impulse to submit, and ask whether it is the stronger or the weaker that
feels benevolent ... joy and the wish to be desired appear together in
the weaker that wants to become a function]{.underline}.\"

Focusing on suffering of the weak devalues life -- we need to affirm
existence

Yet before we can answer these questions we must gain an understanding
of Nietzsche's attitude towards suffering, one's own and the suffering
of others. [Nietzsche was highly critical of [the
attitude]{.mark}]{.underline} towards suffering prevalent at his time,
and indeed now, [where]{.underline} suffering, particularly the
[[suffering of others]{.underline}]{.mark}, of the multitude of others,
mattered and [[mattered greatly]{.underline}]{.mark}. He blamed
Christianity for this and also, more narrowly because applying only to
the educated, Schopenhauer. Nietzsche observed how both Christianity and
Schopenhauer ascribe to our suffering empirical as well as metaphysical
significance. Christian dogma links empirical suffering here on earth to
both original and personal sin and promises release via purification and
atonement as well as salvation via Christ; while Schopenhauer states
that our empirical suffering is but the inevitable outcome of a
metaphysical reality governed by a blind, relentless drive to life --
the Will. Thus both theories offer an explanation why suffering is so
pervasive and the seemingly inescapable lot of each and everyone. In
view of these explanations, [one can readily see why both theories value
and promote Mitleid as an appropriate because somewhat soothing and
consoling response. Yet Nietzsche utterly rejects this response,
particularly its passivity and easy slide to resignation.]{.underline}
Nor is that all. Even more abhorrent, because [more threatening to
Nietzsche's revaluation project, are the wider consequences of the
Christian and Schopenhauerian views, inasmuch as both **[drain value out
of]{.mark} this [our earthly lives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Christianity
postulates life on earth as a mere testing station and hence just
preliminary to the real life to come in the beyond]{.underline}; and
[[Schopenhauer]{.underline}]{.mark}, with his well-known pessimism,
**[[goes]{.mark} even [further]{.mark} by [claiming]{.mark} that [it
would be better for us not to be born]{.mark}, thus [rejecting life
altogether]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Given that]{.underline}]{.mark}
[one of Nietzsche's [**most urgent aims** was]{.mark} the
[affirmation]{.mark}]{.underline} and, indeed, re-affirmation [[of
life]{.mark}, it is [not surprising]{.mark} why the combination of
Mitleid and [negative significance of suffering should be seen]{.mark}
by him [as]{.mark} a threat and [odious obstacle]{.mark} to his
aim.]{.underline}

Against *Mitleid* and against the negative significance of suffering
Nietzsche puts forward his own proposals. He argues in *On the Genealogy
of Morals \[III:14\]* that suffering and particularly the
[[suffering]{.mark} of others]{.underline}, i.e. the suffering of [the
sick, weak, and misshapen multitude [of the herd**, must not be allowed
to obstruct the life of the strong - those**]{.mark} **lucky, talented,
healthy [few]{.mark} who [must be promoted]{.mark} because needed [as
blueprint for future men]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He [warns]{.underline}
us therefore [against]{.underline} what he calls '[the conspiracy of the
sufferers against the well-formed and victorious' and makes his famous
claim that the weak pose the greatest danger to the strong, and that the
strong and healthy have to be shielded from polluting contact with the
sick with their secret resentment and veiled pleas for
Mitleid]{.underline}*.* On a more positive note, **[[Nietzsche urges us
to accept]{.mark} our [suffering as an integral part of a worthwhile
life]{.mark}, to [actively]{.mark} and purposefully [master it]{.mark}
[and not]{.mark} just [passively 'suffer' it. Active acceptance]{.mark}
and mastering are [not just better]{.mark} ways of [coping with
suffering]{.mark}, they [function]{.mark} at the same time also [as an
affirmation of life]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hence [Nietzsche despised
the feeble resignation and impotent resentment with which members of the
herd fail to accept their suffering, thus fail to cope, thus fail to
affirm.]{.underline}

Their benign mission is informed by a lust for power -- their herd
instinct makes violence inevitable

University of Jerusalem and Hans Jonas Professor at the Graduate
Faculty, the New School, "Nietzsche as an affirmative thinker," 49-50,
google books) Zanezor

Nietzsche's account began with two types, the aristocratic master, the
servile slave. [The [master]{.mark}]{.underline} is, and his [[morality
extols]{.mark}, health, competition, beauty. independence, power,
self-control, pride, spontaneity, and [passion]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[self-directed [master derives his values **not from**]{.mark} **the
community, not from "[the herd," but]{.mark} presumably [from the
abundance of his own life]{.mark} and strength**. [The
slave]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} however, [fears the strength and
power of the master; and he [despises him]{.mark}. He is [dependent,
powerless]{.mark}, without self-direction, discipline or
self-control]{.underline}. To seize control over his own psychic
destiny, [the [slave must curb and tame his master]{.mark}]{.underline}.
He must displace him in a sense. And the [[method of "overcoming" the
master]{.mark} arid his morality, the means to his displacement, [is to
render the values of the herd]{.mark} absolute and
[universal]{.mark}]{.underline}. This revolt of the slaves in moral
matters is both creative and resentful. [Powerless to effect a
fundamental change in his condition, he [wreaks vengeance
against]{.mark} the [master by converting the master's attributes into
vices]{.mark}.]{.underline} And while master morality sanctions
coexistence with "inferior" types and morals, the resentment of the
slave yearns for universality. Nothing is to escape its moral clutches
alive. Nietzsche does not mean to suggest that the slave's resentment of
and revenge against the master is either direct or conscious.

It is in this context, the context of moral-psychological imperialism,
that the slave's resentment is to be understood. [Since [the
slave]{.mark} cannot displace the master in reality, he [avenges]{.mark}
himself [symbolically]{.mark}, mythically. [Hence the triumph of the
religion of the slave]{.mark} --- Christianity]{.underline} (and
Judaism). Christianity is [first of all the Ideology of slave morality
for Nietzsche. It expresses the slave's resentment against the
attributes of master morality by vilifying them]{.underline}. The
[[**virtues of the muter become "sin.' In place of power, it is said
that the meek shall inherit the earth. Pride is sin. Humility is
virtue**. **Charity**]{.mark}, chastity, and obedience [replace
competition]{.mark}, sensuality, and autonomy.]{.underline}

Finally, the innocence of existence, its topic neutrality, too, is
abolished in the triumph of slave morality qua Christianity. On this
view, [Christianity is the fruit of resentment. As a product of weakness
it [represents]{.mark} the [decline of life]{.mark}, decadence,
degeneracy, [in contrast to the **exuberant ascent of life which seeks
expression**]{.mark} **in master morality**]{.underline}. And so it also
follows for Nietzsche that [Christianity]{.underline}, like Platonic
philosophy, [severs body and soul]{.underline}, that [it deprecates the
human body. Impulse. instinct, passion, beauty, the intellect, as well
as aesthetic values generally]{.underline}.

[Nietzsche goes]{.underline} so far as [to [see even in the rise of
democratic and socialist movements]{.mark} the [vestiges of
Christianity]{.mark}]{.underline}. vestiges of [the slave
morality]{.underline} I have been mentioning: "[We shall wreak vengeance
and abuse upon all whose equals we are not]{.underline}'--- thus do the
tarantula-hearts vow. "[And '[will to equality' shall]{.mark} henceforth
[be the name for virtue]{.mark}; and [against all
that]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[has power we want to]{.mark} raise our [clamor]{.mark}.]{.underline}'
You preachers of equality, the tyrannomania of impotence clamors thus
out of you for equality: [**your [most secret ambitions to be
tyrants]{.mark} thus [shroud themselves in words of virtue]{.mark}**!
Aggrieved conceit, [repressed envy]{.mark} --- perhaps the conceit and
envy of your fathers --- [erupt]{.mark} from you [as]{.mark} a flame and
as [the **frenzy of revenge**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} (Z "On the
Tararnubs") Note that the [[will to equality is]{.underline}]{.mark}
here characterized by Nietzsche as a [[disguised **lust for
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [objective as in all slave morality,
is to slake the thirst to be tyrants**. "[Tyrannomania" is possible only
for those who]{.mark} feel and indeed [are unequal,]{.mark} for those
[who]{.mark} must [legislate to others]{.mark} in order [to feel
equal]{.mark}, for those who must dominate.** [For those who are]{.mark}
genuinely [superior, domination]{.mark} is cultural. It is
self-directed. It **[needs no "other]{.mark}."**]{.underline} For
Nietzsche this struggle between spirit and power is always and
everywhere in evidence.

In the end, no one can spend more than he has: that is true of the
individual. it is true of a people\... culture and the State --- one
should not deceive oneself about this --- are antagonists\... One lives
off the other, one thrives at the expense of the other. (TI "What the
Germans Lack" 4) We may now be in a better position to appreciate the
force of Nietzsche's claim that [democracy and socialism are to be
understood as growing on the soil of Christianity; for [we now]{.mark}
need to [see the state as the supplanting deity]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the lives of Europeans. The [**[state is a surrogate
god]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Even Hegel's philosophizing is sometimes
understood by Nietzsche in the coarse sense in which it was later to be
assimilated by other authors, as providing nurture for
authoritarian-totalitarian readings of history and destiny. For example,
Hegel: \...Right is with the victorious: they represent the progress of
mankind. Attempt to prove the dominion of morality by means of history.
(WP 415) The significance of German philosophy (Hegel): to evolve a
pantheism through which evil, error, and suffering are not felt as
arguments against divinity. This grandiose project has been misused by
the existing powers (state. etc.). as if it sanctioned the rationality
of whoever happened to be ruling. (WP 416)

The [[nation-state retains a **transcendent value and mission**]{.mark},
a providential role [which history]{.mark} expresses and [seeks to
realize.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Bismarckophobia" and virulent
"nationalism" may generally be read as interchangeable expressions in
Nietzsche's litany without much loss of sense. And [again it is the herd
instinct. The morality of the slavish, which seeks expression
here.]{.underline} [Dreams of universality now attach to the nation and
its state with missionary fervor and zeal. **[The slaughter of rivals
and the conquest of the earth proceed under the banner of universal
brotherhood]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But that is merely
symptomatic of the tyrannomania of impotence." Again, [the [herd
instinct,]{.mark} the need to be in it together, collective revenge. is
what [runs rampant in nationalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} And just as the
God of Christianity represented life at ebb tide, at bottom, just as God
represented a force essentially hostile to life, so the nation-State,
too, represents the aspirations of the "base," the "despicable," the
"slave," on this view.

[Supposedly, we do not have the right to rest "as long as a]{.underline}

and nationality so as to honor only the universal figure of suffering
Man. [Any struggle against oppression becomes my struggle. It does not
occur to our good apostles that there is no common denominator to these
conflicts and that justice varies from one country to another, depending
on its context.]{.underline} I am supposed to extend myself everywhere,
and in the same day I am supposed to mobilize for Nicaragua, the
guerillas in El Salvador, mutilated Moslem women, and vivisected cats,
dogs, and mice, without forgetting the latest strike in a Parisian
factory or some demand students have hurled at their professors.
[Everything concerns me, and I must put myself into the midst of the

[We cannot pretend to imitate Jesus. People exist for us only in
situations where we encounter them. If course, in all our actions the
rest of the world is somehow involved and the extent of our
responsibilities is related to the dimensions of our

because they are our neighbors, and their expectations define our
priorities of action. [Even if every enterprise is ultimately tied to
the rest of the human race, our solidarity is primarily local or
national]{.underline}. What relation is there between a taxi drivers'
strike in Marseille and a demonstration by peanut farmers in the Ivory
Coast? What do road blocks put up by wine growers in southern France
have to do with the struggle of Arizona Indians against the U.S. federal

The greatest weight.--- [What, if]{.underline} some day or night [a
demon were to]{.underline} steal after you into your loneliest
loneliness and [say]{.underline} to you: "This life as you now live it
and have lived it, [you will have to live once more and innumerable
times more; and there will be nothing new in it]{.underline}, but [every
pain and every joy]{.underline} and every thought and sigh and
everything unutterably small or great [in your life will]{.underline}
have to [return to you]{.underline}, all in the same succession and
sequence---even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and
even this moment and myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is
turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!"

[Would you]{.underline} not [throw yourself down]{.underline} and gnash
your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? [Or]{.underline} have you
once experienced a tremendous moment when you [would have answered him:
"**You are a god and never have I heard anything more
divine**]{.underline}." If this thought gained possession of you, it
would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each
and every thing, "[Do you desire this once more and innumerable times
more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well
disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave
nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and
seal]{.underline}?

Relating this back to suffering, if [one cannot embrace all that one
lives through]{.underline}, which includes profound suffering, [then one
cannot embrace the idea of the eternal recurrence. In embracing the
eternal recurrence one embraces every aspect of one's life.]{.underline}
I want to say that part of **[this [embrace involves the recognition of
the necessity and life enhancing aspects of suffering---the recognition
that suffering thereby has a meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To my
knowledge, Nietzsche does not say directly that suffering can or cannot
be given a meaning through the acknowledgment and embracement of its
necessary and life enhancing aspects. But it is clear that insofar as
[Nietzsche's [alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} ideal involves the
eternal recurrence it also [involves embracing one's
suffering:]{.underline}

My [formula for greatness in a human being is [amor fati: that one wants
nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
eternity]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Not merely bear what is
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}, still less conceal it---all idealism is
mendacious in the face of what is necessary---**[[but love
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[To live is to suffer; to be able to embrace one's life means being able
to embrace, to love, one's suffering---one's fate as a creature who is
born to suffer.]{.underline}

[[Seeing our suffering as meaningful]{.mark} for]{.underline} its
necessary and [life enhancing aspects should [mean a **rejection of
suicidal nihilism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For [suffering would then no
longer be without a meaning]{.underline}, which is [the central
motivating factor of suicidal nihilism]{.underline}; further, if we
couple this alternative ideal with the eternal recurrence, [[we affirm
life]{.mark} and thus [do not want to end it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In contrast to]{.underline} this [compassion which "gets things wrong,"
[Nietzsche paints]{.mark} a]{.underline} rather mysterious [alternative
which]{.underline} somehow ["gets things right]{.underline}." This is
[[a "more manly brother of compassion]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[ma¨nnlicheren Bruder des Mitleidens\]" (MR I:78, p. 79), Nietzsche
writes; it is "a feeling for which I find no name accurate" (WM 367, pp.
198--199). At one point, [this unnamable [Ubermitleid is identified with
the "species of suffering" experienced only when "the genius of ability
and of knowledge is amalgamated with moral genius]{.mark} in the same
individual." Such]{.underline} a man [has "an extra- and suprapersonal
sensibility attuned to a nation, to mankind, to a whole culture, to all
suffering existence]{.underline} \[allem leidenden Dasein\], [which
[acquires]{.mark} its [value through its connection with very difficult
and remote forms of knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}." [In contrast to
such a sensibility, "compassion itself]{.underline} \[Mitleid an sich\]
[remains of very little value"]{.underline} (MAM I:157, p. 84).

At another point, Nietzsche insists [the sensibility he is advocating is
actually not a sort of suffering]{.underline}, not a sort of Leid or
Mitleid, at all. [It is not compassion]{.underline}, he writes, "that
[[opens the gates to]{.underline}]{.mark} the most distant and strange
types of being and culture" but rather [[a kind of empathy that]{.mark}
"does not 'suffer with']{.underline} \[nicht 'mitleidet'\]
[but]{.underline} on the contrary [[takes delight in]{.mark} a hundred
[things that led people to suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}." This [manlier
brother of compassion is [a sort of "feeling-with and

which is nonetheless "**[[far from being
compassionate]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[mitleidig\]" (MR II:113, p. 113).
In today's English terminology, it is [a [joyous]{.mark}, sometimes
cruel [empathy that pitilessly penetrates into another's
experience]{.mark} of suffering without ever coming to feel this
suffering itself.]{.underline} This empathy may emotionally overwhelm
those who experience it, but Nietzsche insists that their delightful
pain is not compassionate. "[[Even when]{.mark} we are [shaken
by]{.mark} the [sight of suffering and moved to
tears]{.mark}]{.underline}," he writes, "[[we do
not]{.underline}]{.mark} by any means for that reason [[feel like

Nietzsche is undoubtedly filled with rage at those who bring about the
degeneration of humanity by obtaining the compassion of their natural
superiors, rage seemingly justified from the perspective of life.
Nonetheless, his precise feelings toward compassion take a rather
surprising form. "Anyone . . . who approached this almost deliberate
degeneration and atrophy of man represented by the Christian European .
. . would surely have to cry out in wrath, in compassion \[mit Mitleid
\], in horror: 'O you dolts, you presumptuous, compassionate
\[mitleidigen\] dolts, what have you done!" (JGB III: 62, p. 265).
[Nietzsche,]{.underline} in other words, [reacts to the sight of
humanity diminishing itself through compassion with compassion, albeit a
"**higher and more farsighted compassion**]{.underline} \[Mitleiden\]"
[than the Christian]{.underline} and quasi-post-Christian [moralists'
foolish hatred of sheer suffering]{.underline}. "Thus," Nietzsche
concludes, "[it is compassion versus compassion]{.underline} \[Mitleid
also gegen Mitleid\]" (JGB VII:225, pp. 343--44). Given all of
Nietzsche's arguments outlined above, however, how can he possibly
endorse compassion in any form? Can there really be a compassion of
strength?

One might answer in the negative, while finding some appropriately noble
disposition that could perform an analogous function in the case of the
strong and pitiless. [Such a sentiment]{.underline} would lead the
naturally healthy aristocrat to the service of a degenerating humanity
without dragging him into the great cesspool of human suffering. To the
contrary, it [would grow naturally from the very health and power which
keeps the nobleman at such a distance from his miserable inferiors. If
Nietzsche]{.underline}, at times, still [speaks of this]{.underline}
sentiment [as]{.underline} a sort of [compassion, he is using the word
very loosely]{.underline}, and primarily **[for ironic
effect]{.underline}**. And the [[best candidate for such a noble
replacement for compassion is]{.mark} the ["gift-giving virtue]{.mark}"
discussed throughout]{.underline} Thus Spoke [Zarathustra]{.underline}.
In the prologue of that epic work, our hero at first tells the saint
that he has left his lofty seclusion out of a (compassionate?) love of
lesser men. Quickly, however, Zarathustra corrects himself. "Did I speak
of love? I bring men a gift" (Z Prologue:2, p. 123). Nor is the
gift-giving virtue a mere quirk of Nietzsche's protagonist; on the
contrary, [it is [integral to]{.mark} the author's [conception of health
and strength]{.mark}. "Those poor in life, [the weak, impoverish
life]{.mark}]{.underline}," he writes. "**[Those rich in life, [the
strong, enrich it]{.mark}. The [first are parasites]{.mark} of life; the
[second give presents to it]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (WM 48, p. 30). [If
you]{.underline} are naturally, [[vitally noble]{.mark} you will
inevitably "[force all things to]{.mark} and into yourself that they may
[flow back out of your well as]{.mark} the [gifts of]{.mark} your
[love]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Z I "On the Gift-Giving Virtue," 1, p.
187).

The [[gift-giving virtue]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is by no means
a form of compassion]{.mark}, let alone a compassion of
strength]{.underline}. Instead, [it is [compassion's **usurper and
replacement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[The [noble human being helps the
unfortunate]{.mark}, but not]{.underline}, or almost not, [from
compassion]{.underline} \[nicht oder fast nicht aus Mitleid\], but
[[prompted]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[by an urge begotten by excess of

overlook or underestimate that "fast."36 [To suggest that Nietzsche is
discussing the gift-giving virtue when he approves of compassion does
violence to his insistence that his "higher" Mitleid still deserves that
otherwise lowly appellation.]{.underline} A genuinely compassionate form
of compassion is, for Nietzsche, still actively present in the noble
soul.

We need to embrace a master morality -- allows for new freedom

[In place of]{.underline} the ["herd or "slave morality" promoted by
democracy, socialism, and Christianity, Nietzsche advocated a master
moralitv]{.underline}---at least [for the outstanding individuals who
have the courage to adopt it. [Slave virtues]{.mark} may be [fine
for]{.mark} the [masses who endorse their **own mediocre**]{.mark} **and
obsequious [slate but these]{.mark} virtues [must not]{.mark} be allowed
to [govern the strong,]{.mark} decisive, daring. and creative
individuals whom Nietzsche called the "[masters]{.mark}."**]{.underline}
They [[must have a new ethic founded on the will to power rather than on
safety and conformity]{.mark} one that brings about a transvaluation of
all values or is "[beyond good and evil]{.mark}]{.underline}." The
[masters can [transcend conventional morality]{.mark} and, creating
their own code, [assume leadership of the world, guiding it out of the
lethargy]{.mark} and stagnation [into which slave morality has plunged
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nietzsche advocated]{.underline} a dualistic
theory of morals, with [one set of principles for masters and another
for slaves]{.underline}, although [he [hoped for the eventual dispersion
of the mass of slaves as they achieved progressive
self-awareness.]{.mark}]{.underline} For [[no man is a slave or a master
by nature]{.mark}, but [only through cowardice or

uses his capacity for free action to escape the abject
state]{.underline}; he [**[takes the risk of freedom to create himself
according to his own lights and raise humanity to a new level]{.mark}**.

#  Alt Solves Value {#alt-solves-value .Block-Title}

The selflessness of the aff is parasitic -- only an individualist
paradigm has value

**Hunt 6** (Lester, Philosophy Prof at U of Wisconsin-Madison in in the
areas of moral, political, and legal philosophy, "THUS SPAKE HOWARD
ROARK: NIETZSCHEAN IDEAS IN THE FOUNTAINHEAD," MUSE) Zanezor

In his courtroom speech, [he]{.underline} makes an important move that
he refrained from making in the last dialogue with Wynand: he [specifies
and describes the way of life that he takes to be the only alternative
to the second-hander's way]{.underline}. The name he gives to the
alternative charactertype has an eminently Nietzschean clang to it: he
calls contrasting type ["the creator."]{.underline}15 His initial
description of it suggests a much deeper connection than merely verbal
echoes: The [**[creators are not selfless]{.mark}**. It is [the]{.mark}
whole [secret of their power]{.mark}---that it [was
self-sufficient]{.mark}, self-motivated, self-generated. "first cause, a
fount of energy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The creator [served
nothing and no one]{.mark}. He had lived for himself.]{.underline}" (p.
737)16 Here Roark characterizes the positive pole of his distinction
between the two ways of life first of all in terms of its power, and he
characterizes the nature of this power as a process that, because its
activity flows from its own internal nature and not from external
stimuli, presents itself to an external point of view as spontaneous. So
far, the point of view is thoroughly Nietzschean. The anti-Nietzschean
moment comes near the end of the speech, when he says that the sphere of
activity of the creator "includes the whole sphere of his creative
faculty, his work," but "does not include the sphere of the gangster,
the altruist and the dictator" (pp. 740--41). The reason he immediately
gives for this pronouncement is however strikingly Nietzschean: [[Rulers
of men . . . create nothing. **They exist entirely through the persons
of others**]{.mark}**.** Their goal is in their subjects, in the
activity of enslaving. [They are as dependent as the
beggar]{.mark}]{.underline}, the social worker, the bandit. The [form of
dependence does not matter]{.underline}. (p. 741).

As a criticism of the "rulers of men," this line of thinking has two
essential elements that are quite different and become explicit in
different parts of his speech. On the one hand, he is alleging
parasitism of a physical sort. Part of his concern, as he indicates
earlier, is with the ways in which human beings manage to survive. As he
says: Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be
produced. And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in
only one of two ways---by the independent work of his own mind or as a
parasite fed by the minds of others. The creator originates. The
parasite borrows. The creator faces nature alone. The parasite faces
nature through an intermediary. (p. 738)

Part of the criticism of "ruling" lies in the simple fact that, [in so
far as hegemony functions as a way of making one's way, of surviving,
then what one is doing is **getting others to provide one with the
wherewithal to live**. [It is]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[original
producers]{.mark} who are using their powers to [make human life
possible]{.mark}, the [ruler is simply]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this
respect, [**[a parasite, physically dependent on
others]{.underline}**.]{.mark} As Roark puts it, "the basic need of the
secondhander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed" (p.
738). It is easy to see how someone could use this idea to argue that
this way of life represents a low grade or quantity of power.

There is, as I have said, another aspect of Roark's critique of
hegemonic power. It is less obvious than this one but necessary to the
unity of his position. He touches on this aspect when at one point in
his speech he says: "**[[The man who attempts to live for others is a
dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he
serves]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (p. 738). There are two completely
different sorts of parasitism being alleged here. The sort of
[parasitism that he says is brought about by one who attempts to live
for others is obviously the physical dependence that I have just
addressed: he is saying that [if one is the recipient of the
**altruistically donated services** of others one is]{.mark}, in that
respect, physically [dependent on the productive capacities of
others]{.mark} for the wherewithal to make one's way in the
world]{.underline}. But the other sort of parasitism, the [[parasitism
"in motive]{.underline}]{.mark}," this **[[exists in]{.mark} the [one
who renders]{.mark} the [services]{.mark}, and just because one has made
the attempt to live for others, is an entirely different sort of
thing.]{.underline}** So, for that matter, is the sort of dependence
that he was alleging in the description of Keating in the earlier
dialogue with Wynand. There the dependence, the secondariness, of the
second-hander was located not, primarily, in the realm of physical fact,
but in that of the consciousness of the facts. As Rand puts it earlier
in an earlier passage summarizing Keating's psychology: He was great;
great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as
the number of people who believed him. He looked at the faces, at the
eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift
of life. (pp. 196--97)

For Keating, [the standard of value, the one feature of the world that
is an infallible indicator of value, is not in his own consciousness,
nor in the facts, but in other people's estimates of the facts. Keating
is]{.underline} not only a physical parasite but, one might say, [an
axiological parasite, in that the [consciousness of others is what puts
the **stamp of value one his own life.** At the basis of his system of
values is]{.mark} thus a certain [compulsion to look
outward]{.mark}.]{.underline} He does not [[seek the
other]{.underline}]{.mark} in order to gratefully affirm a pre-existing
conviction of his own value, but [**[for the foundation]{.mark} of his
values**. To understand fully his way of [life is]{.mark} to see it as
[a reaction to external stimuli]{.mark}.]{.underline} All this of course
is in accord with Nietzsche's way of thinking on these matters. But
Roark suggests by implication that [those whose fundamental value is to
rule others are open to the same sort of critique]{.underline}. He does
not explicitly say why this is so in his courtroom speech, but Rand
hints at the reason in the novel, primarily in the characterization of
Keating.

At first glance, this seems odd. Keating, one might suppose, is a quite
different sort of character from the predatory Wynand. He is the
charming young man who makes his way by pleasing others---by flattering
them and imitating them, and not by overcoming and subduing them.
Actually, Rand is careful to indicate that there is a darker site to
Keating's second-handedness, and her treatment of Keating is meant to
show how both sorts of parasitism are essential to the character-type
that seeks power over others.

Keating's character has always had a predatory side, an aspect that he
describes (using the term in an un-Roarkian sense) as "selfish." Soon
after he goes to work for the architectural firm of Francon and Heyer,
he goes to work on Tim Davis, the favored draftsman in the office;
eventually, as a series of devious "favors" for him, he takes over most
of Davis' responsibilities in the office, so that he is eventually
fired. Keating takes his place. He then manipulates the head designer,
Claude Stengel, into leaving the firm in order to start one of his own.
Then, when he comes to face his first assignment as designer, the
thought of the men he defeated in order to win this opportunity is
deeply meaningful to him, and yet at the same time somehow meaningless.
He "thought of Tim Davis, of Stengel, of many others who had wanted
\[this opportunity\], had struggled for it, had tried, had been
beaten---by him. It was a triumphant

CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

feeling." Yet as far as the actual execution of this assignment itself
is concerned, these victories are no help at all. Instead of seeing the
building, a simple residence, "rise up before him, he saw it sinking; he
saw its shape as a pit in the ground; and as a pit within him; as an
emptiness, with only Davis and Stengel rattling uselessly within it" (p.
70).

[When he has drawn up a plan for the house he is, in spite of many hours
of work on it, still radically uncertain of its value;]{.underline} and
he decides to do the same thing he had done with his most important
projects in college: [he seeks]{.underline} Roark's [help]{.underline}.
Later, when he is attempting to design a submission for a highly
publicized building competition, his one great chance for early fame,
the incident is narrated in a manner calculated to underline the
parallel with his designing his first residence. Keating finds himself
thinking of "the man who might win and be proclaimed publicly his
superior," of the absolute necessity of defeating that man. As to the
inner resources he might use to beat him, "there was no Peter Keating,
there was only a suction chamber" that sucked other beings dry "and thus
acquired its own substance." Again, he goes to Roark for help (p. 180).
[Overcoming and subduing other people is not merely a side-effect of
Keating's achieving his goals, nor is it a means to an end. It is one of
his values, in the sense that it is something that he pursues as good in
itself.]{.underline} What Rand is suggesting is that [if such things are
pursued as good in themselves, then the there is no way to
satisfactorily explain why it has this sort of value except by
**supposing that it rests on the sense of validity one derives from the
consciousness of others, either of the defeated rivals or those who are
impressed by it**]{.underline}. The [point of the activity lies in
either case in the substitution of the recognition by some other person
for one's own judgment. The seeking of hegemonic power]{.underline},
then[, is an instance of the axiological parasitism of the second-hander
in fundamentally the same way that]{.underline} Keating's [less
malevolent activities are. [Those who seek]{.mark} ultimately [to rule
or hurt]{.mark} others [are **"selfless" in the same way that those who
seek ultimately to serve or please others.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Can we say now, as Hillesheim does, that [since harsh conditions and
suffering can "function as a psychological stimulant to further growth"
that "Suffering is thus not without meaning; man's suffering is
transfigured by the knowledge that it serves a life-enhancing
end]{.underline}"? Or as Sefler says, in regard to an individual giving
meaning to her suffering, "[The proper way of understanding
suffering]{.underline}, Friedrich Nietzsche proposes, **[is to
acknowledge its existence and to give it a positive and necessary status
within human life]{.underline}**"? We still have yet to look at the role
of the eternal recurrence, which is what Leiter takes to be the center
of Nietzsche's offered alternative ideal to the ascetic ideal, yet at
this point we can say, *pace* Leiter, that [suffering can be given a
meaning, we can answer the question "Why do I suffer?" with, "I suffer,
not as a punishment, but in order to become better and stronger; it is
up to me to use my suffering]{.underline}." This **[answer differs in an
important way from that of [the religious answer]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
say, that of the Christian or Buddhist. Whereas [[they are
backwards-looking]{.mark}, looking [for a cause]{.mark} or
reason]{.underline} for our suffering, [[our]{.underline}]{.mark}
Nietzschean [**[answer is forward-looking]{.mark}**: suffering has
meaning not because it is deserved but because of its possible **life
enhancing capabilities**. Suffering is]{.underline} not to be endured as
a deserved punishment, but **[[embraced because it is pregnant with
possibilities for growth and power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

We must, however, be careful with this answer. The [idea that suffering
is]{.underline} somehow [justified]{.underline} through its
life-enhancing capabilities **[does not mean that the great joy that may
result from profound suffering is a justification for our
suffering.]{.underline}** At least this is [not what Nietzsche wanted to
say]{.underline}: "[[The more volcanic the earth, the greater the
happiness]{.mark} will be]{.underline} - **[[but it would be ludicrous
to say that this happiness justified suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}**
per se.\" But this brings to light another issue: if the joy that might
result from suffering does not justify suffering, why should the
strengthening aspect of suffering justify or give meaning to suffering?
After all, if both happiness and enhancement are possible *results* of
suffering, and happiness does not justify suffering, why should
enhancement? For Nietzsche, the answer might be that [**[human greatness
is a goal]{.mark}, but human [happiness is not]{.mark}**. It is
[suffering, not happiness,]{.mark} that [makes
great]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, [since happiness is not to be desired
over suffering to begin with, any happiness that results from "volcanic
earth" is not going to justify our suffering. But the life-[enhancing
aspects of suffering]{.mark} do [give]{.mark} suffering [meaning
because]{.mark} human [greatness is more desirable than]{.mark} human
[happiness]{.mark}]{.underline} per se. However, this possible response
to suffering and its meaning is still incomplete. We must turn to
further considerations.

The [strengthening role of suffering]{.underline} in human life [is
another mark against religious morality]{.underline} for Nietzsche. [He
saw]{.underline} the strengthening of the species as desirable; or more
precisely, he saw the **[cultivation of higher types of humans as
desirable]{.underline}** (more on this below). This is one of the
reasons his tongue was so sharp in his polemic against religious
morality. In previous sections we witnessed his reasons for considering
the ascetic priest's method of giving meaning to our suffering
mendacious and deleterious. Here we can bring forth another reason for
his distaste for religious morality. [We saw the various palliatives
provided by the ascetic priest for his flock---a flock that consists of
the meek]{.underline}, those who have twisted earlier valuations and
[who have found ways to protect and propagate themselves]{.underline}.
As such, [Nietzsche sees them as weakening the species]{.underline}, and
this is why he says of Buddhism and Christianity:

[They seek to preserve]{.underline}, to preserve alive [whatever can
possibly be preserved]{.underline}...the *sovereign*
[[religions]{.underline}]{.mark} we have had so far are among the chief
causes that [[have kept]{.underline}]{.mark} the type **[["man" on a
lower rung]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[they have preserved too much of
what ought to perish...to preserve all that was sick and that
suffered]{.underline}---which means, in fact and in truth, to *worsen
the European race*....

Leiter notes rightly that [if the [ascetic ideal has been the
only]{.mark} ideal so far [available]{.mark}, **the [appearance of an
alternative ideal would be of "enormous
significance]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Nietzsche writes concerning the
ascetic ideal, "Above all, **[a [counterideal was lacking---until
Zarathustra]{.mark}]{.underline}**." So it seems [Nietzsche sees himself
as offering such a counterideal with his Zarathustra.]{.underline}
Leiter writes that a new ideal must be able to answer the question
"Suffering for what?" and thus be able to block suicidal nihilism. But
what kind of ideal is Nietzsche offering?

In his discussion of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* in *Ecce Homo*, Nietzsche
writes that the penultimate section of the fourth book of his *The Gay
Science* contains "the basic idea of *Zarathustra*." As Kaufman notes,
[[the idea]{.underline}]{.mark} here referred to [[is]{.mark} the
[eternal recurrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nietzsche starts the
discussion by writing that, "[The fundamental conception]{.underline} of
\[*Thus Spoke Zarathustra*\] [is the idea of the eternal recurrence,
**this [highest formula of affirmation]{.mark} that is at all
[attainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}...." To this Leiter adds that the
[embracing]{.underline} of the [[eternal recurrence would **remove
suicidal nihilism**, since someone who is nihilistically suicidal is not
going to want to repeat life eternally]{.mark}, but end it
prematurely]{.underline}. From this Leiter concludes that the teaching
of the [eternal recurrence is the alternative]{.underline} ideal offered
by Nietzsche through Zarathustra, "for whom, '**[Pain is not considered
an objection to life']{.underline}** (EH III: Z-1) and who 'says Yes to
the point of justifying, of redeeming even all of the past' (EH III:
Z-8)." Further, Nietzsche writes in *Beyond Good and Evil* that [[if we
"look down]{.mark} into the most [world-denying]{.mark} of all possible
ways of [thinking",]{.mark} [free of]{.mark} the [**delusive force**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} religious [[morality, we]{.underline}]{.mark}
may [[see]{.underline}]{.mark} the opposite ideal:

**[The [ideal of the most]{.mark} high-spirited, alive, and
[world-affirming]{.mark} human [being]{.mark} [who has not only come to
terms]{.mark} and learned to get along with [whatever was and is, but
who wants]{.mark} to have [what]{.mark} was [and is repeated]{.mark}
into all eternity, shouting insatiably da capo---not only to himself but
to the whole play and spectacle]{.underline}**....

If the ideal that Nietzsche offers is the eternal recurrence and this
ideal can stave off suicidal nihilism, there still remains the question
of what meaning, if any, can be found for suffering in relation to the
eternal recurrence.

According to Leiter, the whole-hearted embracing of the eternal
recurrence involves an acceptance of there not being any meaning to our
suffering. To substantiate this claim Leiter quotes Nietzsche's claim
that the human will needs an aim and it would rather will nothing, i.e.,
the ascetic ideal, than not will. The [eternal recurrence
provides]{.underline} no meaning or justification for our suffering but
it does provide [another aim for the will: rather than will the ascetic
ideal, one can will the eternal recurrence of every pleasure and pain,
every small detail of one's life]{.underline}. There is the problem
perhaps that only the strongest can embrace the idea of the eternal
recurrence, and therefore, the ascetic ideal will still be needed for
the majority of wretched souls. But the [eternal recurrence
is]{.underline} at least [a true and great possibility for those **great
human souls** who are strong enough to handle its
consequences.]{.underline}

To be fair, the least developed part of Leiter's interpretation of the
*Genealogy of Morals* is this last part, where he speaks of the eternal
recurrence as an alternative to the ascetic ideal. Nevertheless, this is
where is interpretation is weakest and, I believe, needs to be revised.
A case can be made, and I will now attempt to make it, that [suffering
can be given a meaning along the lines of the eternal recurrence by way
of acknowledging the necessity of suffering for greatness in human
achievement and development]{.underline}. Let us now turn to this
possibility.

If we are not to try to abolish all suffering, which ultimately amounts
to merely avoiding suffering some of the time, then how can we view
suffering in a way that is fecund and best for the enhancement of life?
Perhaps [[one way to change our view of suffering is through the sincere
acknowledgment that suffering has positive aspects]{.mark}, some of
which might be necessary for human greatness]{.underline}. Nietzsche
addresses the positive aspects of suffering from many different
directions. Unfortunately, I will only look at two of them in turn.
First, there is the idea that **[[suffering and
joy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (happiness) **[[are
inseparable]{.underline}]{.mark}**; further, to enjoy great joy requires
submitting oneself to (at least the possibility of) great suffering.
Second, suffering makes one strong. Commenting on what he calls the
religion of pity, Nietzsche writes the following about suffering and
happiness:

If you, who adhere to this religion, have the same attitude toward
yourselves that you have toward your fellow men; [if you refuse to let
your own suffering lie upon you for an hour and if you constantly try to
prevent and forestall all possible stress way ahead of time; if you
experience suffering and displeasure as evil]{.underline}, hateful,
worthy of annihilation, and as a defect of existence, [then it is clear
that besides your religion of pity you also harbor another religion in
your heart that is perhaps the mother of the religion of pity: the
religion of comfortableness. How little you know of human happiness, you
comfortable and benevolent people, for happiness and unhappiness
are]{.underline} sisters and even [twins that either grow up together
or, as in your case, remain small together.]{.underline}

Here Nietzsche plainly disparages the preference for comfortableness
over pain: those who "worship" comfort know so little of happiness, for
since happiness and unhappiness are twins, when you avoid unhappiness in
your pursuit of comfort you avoid happiness as well. The obvious
question is why should we believe that happiness is so tied to
unhappiness?

In "Nietzsche And Dostoevsky On The Meaning Of Suffering," George F.
Sefler offers a possible answer. Unfortunately without citing his
quotations, Sefler writes that for Nietzsche it is a "philosophical
prejudice" of the metaphysician to postulate "antithetical absolutes";
for every good or pleasurable concept there exists an opposite concept:
pleasure and pain are paired but antithetical. Further, according to
Sefler, the metaphysician has claimed the impossibility "of the
generation of one absolute from its respective opposite." Nietzsche,
according to Sefler, thinks these prejudices need to be reexamined, the
implication being that the metaphysician is wrong to postulate such
absolute opposites and that pleasure and pain really are not opposites
in this sense. But so presented the case for great pleasures requiring
great suffering remains unconvincing. James W. Hillesheim, discussing
Nietzsche and self-overcoming, writes that we must get rid of the
"dualistic view of pleasure and pain." Appealing to Ryle's notion of a
category mistake, he calls this dualistic view of pleasure and pain a
misclassification. In making the case on Nietzsche's behalf that
pleasure and pain really are connected, in particular for one
CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

engaged in self-overcoming, he cites a strange passage from Nietzsche's
*The Will to Power*:

[[Nietzsche cites]{.mark} examples of [pleasures in which]{.mark} a
number of [painful stimuli are necessary]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[This is the case]{.underline}, e.g., [[in
tickling]{.underline}]{.mark}, also the sexual tickling in the act of
coitus: here we see displeasure at work as an ingredient of pleasure. It
seems, [a [little hindrance]{.mark} that [is overcome and immediately
followed by another]{.mark} little hindrance that is again overcome --
this game of resistance and victory arouses most strongly that general
feeling of superabundant, excessive power that constitutes the essence
of pleasure.]{.underline}

The opposite, an increase in the sensation of pain through the
introduction of little pleasurable stimuli, is lacking; for pleasure and
pain are not opposites.

Citing tickling and sexual tickling as examples of the combination of
pleasure and pain hardly proves the case that great pleasure requires
great pain. However, the idea we find here, that the constant overcoming
of hindrances gives rise to feelings of excessive power, which in turn
is the essence of pleasure, is important. [It is]{.underline} at least
[[plausible to view]{.mark} hindrances as]{.underline}, in some sense,
[displeasurable]{.underline} in themselves, [and their [overcoming as
giving rise to feelings of]{.mark} power]{.underline}, which are,
according to Nietzsche, [the very [essence of
pleasure]{.mark}]{.underline}. If they are the essence of pleasure, or
at least give rise to pleasure, it further seems plausible to say that
[the [greater the hindrance]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., [the [greater
the]{.mark} displeasure, the greater the feeling of power]{.underline},
and therefore, [[pleasure]{.mark} that will result]{.underline}.
Further, we do find here some reason to disregard the idea that pleasure
and pain are strict opposites. That is, Nietzsche points out that while
certain kinds of pain will give rise to pleasure, certain types of
pleasure will not give rise to pain in the same way.

If we accept the idea that overcoming certain hindrances can lead to
pleasure, and that the greater the hindrance the greater the pleasure,
we do not thereby have to accept that this is the only way to bring
about great pleasure. That is, we do not have to accept it as the only
means to pleasure unless we really take Nietzsche's assertion that the
essence of pleasure is the feeling of superabundant, excessive power;
and it is not obvious that Nietzsche is right about this. It is easy to
imagine great pleasures that do not require feelings of excessive power.
For example, I can love my job, earn money by it, and then go on a
wonderful vacation where everything runs smoothly: I relax, play,
perhaps on a deeper level I commune with nature, and thereby experience
great, non-shallow pleasure. Nietzsche could argue that such pleasures
are not really pleasures after all, much like Socrates does in Plato's
*Republic*, when he argues that physical pleasures are really illusions
and therefore not real pleasures at all. But without serious
argumentation, such a move would be a cheap trick. Nevertheless, there
is something to the idea of great pleasure being cultivated by the
overcoming of great hindrances, even if it does not turn out to be the
only means for experiencing great pleasure. Sefler tries to tie pleasure
and pain together in another way. Life, he writes, is "situational"; it
is made up of interrelated elements whose configurations determine the
meaning of the overall whole:

Elements of experience are such because of their relationality to their
co-elements. [Pain has no meaning "in-itself"; it is meaningful only in
reference to pleasure....And...happiness has no meaning "in-itself," it
is meaningful only in reference to suffering. [If suffering were to
disappear]{.mark} from the world, [happiness would]{.mark} likewise
[disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is, the [happiness-suffering
dimensions of life would combine into a constant, unchangeable state
which would be indifferentiable.]{.underline}

The seven chapters of Appel's book provide a vivid and fair reading of
Nietzsche's texts that exhibit a forceful call for aristocraticism based
on rank, domination, and exploitation, which should be an embarrassing
obstacle to embracing Nietzsche in the service of egalitarian political
movements. [[Appel's position]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[depends
upon an **unnuanced reading** of]{.mark} Nietzsche's motifs of
[domination and power]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is at least [a risky
proposition with a thinker as elusive and complicated]{.underline} as
Nietzsche. The genealogical [[narrative of master and slave morality
need **not be read as a call for domination**]{.mark} of the weak by the
strong, [but as an **unmasking of the power plays** of the weak
and]{.mark} as an [ambiguous blending of]{.mark} master and slave
[forces in cultural production]{.mark}]{.underline}, taken as a
"spiritualization" of erstwhile natural forces of power.7 While we might
never be sure of the meaning of Nietzsche's rich and elusive texts, this
should not blind us to the seeming aristocraticism in much of
Nietzsche's writings. We should admit that such elitism is alive in the
texts, and in this respect Appel is right. Yet the complexity of the
texts should alert us against both easy dismissals and selective
embraces of Nietzsche when it comes to the question of democracy. My
take has been that Nietzsche indeed is anti-egalitarian but that
egalitarianism may not be the sine qua non of democratic politics, and
that many elements of democratic practice and performance are more
Nietzschean than he suspected (or we have suspected). More on this
shortly.

Agonism makes violence impossible -- opponents are necessary

How can we begin to apply the notion of agonistics to politics in
general and democracy in particular? First of all, contestation and
competition can be seen as fundamental to self-development and as an
intrinsically social phenomenon. Agonistics helps us articulate the
social and political ramifications of Nietzsche's concept of will to
power. As Nietzsche put it in an 1887 note, "will to power can manifest
itself only against resistances; it seeks that which resists it" (KSA
12, p.424). [Power]{.underline}, therefore, [is not simply an individual
possession or a goal of action; it is more a global, interactive
conception]{.underline}. For Nietzsche, every advance in life is an
overcoming of some obstacle or counterforce, so that conflict is a
mutual co-constitution of contending forces. [Opposition generates
development. The human self is not formed in some internal sphere and
then secondarily exposed to external relations and conflicts. The [self
is constituted]{.mark} in and [through what it opposes]{.mark} and what
opposes it; in other words, **the self is formed through [agonistic
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, [[any annulment of]{.mark}
one's [Other would be]{.mark} an [annulment of]{.mark} one's
[self]{.mark} in this sense. [Competition can be understood]{.mark} as a
shared activity for the sake of fostering high achievement and
self-development]{.underline}, and therefore **[[as an intrinsically
social activity.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In the light of Nietzsche's appropriation of the two forms of Eris,
**[it is necessary to distinguish between agonistic conflict and sheer
violence]{.underline}**. A [**[radical agonistics rules out
violence]{.mark}**, because [violence is actually an impulse to
eliminate conflict by annihilating]{.mark} or incapacitating [an
opponent, bringing the agon to]{.mark} an [end]{.mark}]{.underline}.11
In a later work Nietzsche discusses the "spiritualization of hostility
(Feindschaft)," wherein [one must affirm both the presence and the power
of one's opponents as implicated in one's own posture]{.underline} (TI
"Morality as Antinature," 3). And in this passage Nietzsche specifically
applies such a notion to the political realm. What this implies is that
the category of the social need not be confined to something like peace
or harmony. Agonistic relations, therefore, do not connote a
deterioration of a social disposition and can thus be extended to
political relations.

Before exploring these questions and confronting Nietzsche's attitude
toward democracy, it is important to set the stage by considering the
matter of institutions, without which political philosophy could very
likely not get off the ground. Modern societies, at least, cannot
function without institutions and the coercive force of law. Appel, like
[many interpreters, construe]{.underline}s [Nietzsche's "political"
thought as advancing more an "aesthetic" activity than institutional
governance]{.underline} (NCD, p.160ff). [Supposedly Nietzsche envisions
an elite who compete with each other for creative results in isolation
from the mass public;]{.underline} indeed the elite simply use the
masses as material for their creative work, without regard for the fate
or welfare of the general citizenry. Appel maintains that such a
political aesthetics is problematic because it is incompatible with the
maintenance of stable institutions. And Nietzsche is also supposed to
eschew the rule of law in favor of the hubris of self-policing (NCD,
p.165). If this were true, one would be hard pressed to find Nietzsche
relevant for any political philosophy, much less a democratic one.

**[[It is a mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[to read
Nietzsche in simple terms as being against institutions]{.mark} and the
rule of law on behalf of self-creation]{.underline}**. First of all,
even Nietzsche's early celebration of the Dionysian should not be taken
as an antior extra-political gesture. In BT 21, Nietzsche insists that
the Apollonian has coequal status with the Dionysian, and the former is
specifically connected with the political order, which is needed to
temper the Dionysian impulse toward "ecstatic brooding" and "orgiastic
self-annihilation."

[Those who read Nietzsche as resisting]{.underline} "normalization" and
["discipline"]{.underline} (this includes most postmodern readings and
Appel's as well13), [are not on very firm ground either]{.underline}.
For one thing, [[Nietzschean creative freedom is selective]{.mark} and
[most]{.mark} people [should be ruled by normative orders]{.mark},
because universal unrestricted freedom would cause havoc.]{.underline}14
Moreover, [**[even selective creative freedom is not an abandonment of
order and constraint]{.mark}.** Creativity [breaks free of existing
structures, but only to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**establish new
ones**.]{.mark} Shaping new forms requires formative powers prepared by
disciplined skills and activated by refined instruments of
production]{.underline}. Accordingly, creativity is a kind of "dancing
in chains" (WS 140).15 [Creative freedom]{.underline}, then, [is not an
abandonment of constraint, but a disruption of structure that still
needs structure to prepare and execute departures from the
norm.]{.underline}

Those who take Nietzsche to be diagnosing social institutions as
descendants of slave morality should take note of GM II,11, where
Nietzsche offers some interesting reflections on justice and law. He
indicates that the global economy of nature is surely not a function of
justice; yet workable conceptions of justice and injustice are
established by the historical force of human law. Nietzsche does not
indict such forces as slavish infirmities. Legal arrangements are
"exceptional conditions" that modulate natural forces of power in social
directions, and that are not an elimination of conflict but an
instrument in channeling the continuing conflict of different power
complexes. Surprisingly, Nietzsche attributes the historical emergence
of law not to reactive resentment but to active, worldly forces that
check and redirect the "senseless raging of revenge," and that are able
to reconfigure offenses as more "impersonal" violations of legal
provisions rather than sheer personal injuries. Here Nietzsche analyzes
the law in a way analogous to his account of the Greek agon and its
healthy sublimation of natural impulses for destruction. A legal system
is a life-promoting cultural force that refashions natural energies in
less savage and more productive directions.

Finally, [those who read Nietzsche as an anti-institutional transgressor
and creator should heed TI]{.underline} ("Skirmishes of an Untimely
Man," 39), [where Nietzsche clearly diagnoses a repudiation of
institutions as a form of decadence. [Because of our modern faith in a
foundational individual freedom, **we no longer have the instincts for
forming and sustaining the traditions and modes of authority that
healthy institutions require**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The **[whole of the
[West no longer possesses]{.mark} the [instincts]{.mark} out of which
institutions grow, o[ut of which a future grows]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
perhaps nothing antagonizes its "modern spirit" so much. One lives for
the day, one lives very fast, one lives very irresponsibly: precisely
this is called "freedom." [That which makes an institution an
institution is despised, hated, repudiated: one fears the danger of a
new slavery the moment the word "authority" is even spoken out loud.
That is how far decadence has advanced in the value-instincts of our
politicians, of our political parties: instinctively they prefer what
disintegrates, what hastens the end.]{.underline}

In the light of these remarks, [a Nietzschean emphasis on power and
agonistics offers significant advantages for political
philosophy.]{.underline} In some respects we are freed from the modern
project of "justifying" the force of social institutions because of a
stipulated freedom from constraint in the "state of nature." [With a
primal conception of power]{.underline}(s), [we can retrieve an
Aristotelian take on social institutions as fitting and productive of
human existence. [Forces of law need not be seen as alien to the self,
but as modulations of a ubiquitous array of forces within which human
beings can locate relative spheres of freedom]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
an agonistic conception of political activity need not be taken as a
corruption or degradation of an idealized order of political principles
or social virtues. Our own tradition of the separation of powers and an
adversarial legal system can be taken as a baseline conception of the
nature, function, and proper operation of government offices and
judicial practice. The founders of the Constitution inherited from
Montesquieu the idea that a division of powers is the best check on
tyranny. In other words, tyranny is avoided not by some project of
harmony, but by multiplying the number of power sites in a government
and affirming their competition through mutual self- assertion and
mistrust.16 [Our common law tradition is agonistic in both conception
and practice]{.underline}. Most procedural rules are built around the
idea of coequal competition in open court before a jury who will decide
the outcome, where the judge in most respects plays the role of an
impartial referee. And the presumption of innocence is fundamentally
meant to contest the government's power to prosecute and punish.17 I
think that both [notions of separation of powers and legal
adversarialism are compatible with Nietzsche's analysis of the law noted
previously---that a legal order is not a means of preventing struggle,
but "a means in the struggle between power-complexes"]{.underline} (GM
II,11).

Appel concedes that [a [political agon can]{.mark} be healthy and
**[prevent]{.mark} the [establishment of]{.mark} entrenched, [permanent
hierarchies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (NCD, p.162). But [he poses an
important question]{.underline}, which is in the spirit of French
neo-liberal critics of Nietzschean politics: [[Might not]{.mark} a
radical [agon]{.mark} all the way down in political life ["debunk"
important democratic "verities"]{.mark} such as universal suffrage,
equal respect, and human rights]{.underline}? This is indeed a pressing
question that many postmodern writers have not addressed adequately. Yet
Appel, like many [critics]{.underline} of postmodernism, [[simply
assumes]{.mark} the truth and [necessity of these traditional democratic
notions]{.mark}, without much articulation of how agonistics threatens
these notions, and without any defense of the viability of these notions
in the wake of Nietzschean genealogical criticisms]{.underline}. Such
criticisms have been effectively advanced by Foucauldian appropriations
of Nietzsche that reveal how modern "reason" cannot help being caught up
in what it presumes to overcome---namely regimes of power---and
consequently cannot help producing exclusionary effects and constraints
that belie the modern rhetoric of emancipation.

[Nietzsche's]{.underline} genealogical [critique of liberal democratic
ideals]{.underline}, I think, [is important]{.underline} and still
relevant [for political philosophy.]{.underline} The question at hand
turns on two possibilities: Does the critique presume a refutation of
these ideals or does it open up the possibility of redescribing these
ideals in quasi- Nietzschean terms? Appel presumes the former
possibility, I take up the latter, while agreeing that most postmodern
appropriations of Nietzsche have not done much to address either
possibility. [We cannot assume the truth of universal suffrage,
equality, and human rights by ignoring Nietzsche's trenchant
attacks]{.underline}. My [strategy has been to redescribe democratic
ideals in the light of Nietzschean suspicions of their traditional
warrants. Universal suffrage, equality, respect, and political [rights
can be defended by way of]{.mark} a [postmodern via negativa
that]{.mark} simply [rules out grounds for exclusion rather than
postulates]{.mark} conditions that warrant
[inclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Nietzschean perspectivism,
metaphysical suspicion, and agonistics simply destabilize politics and
prevent even ostensibly democratic propensities from instigating
exclusions or closed conceptions of political practice. In what follows
I will briefly address two questions: How can a Nietzschean agonistics
be extended to the body politic so as to be viably democratic? How can
agonistics redescribe respect and political rights without the baggage
of traditional egalitarianism so forcefully assailed by Nietzsche?

Appel does indicate that his appraisal of political Nietzscheanism is
not meant to discredit Nietzsche but to invite democrats to face
Nietzsche's challenge and defend democratic ideals (NCD, p.167). He
admits that Nietzsche forces us to ask: Why equality? Equality of what?
(NCD, p.169). We cannot dismiss Nietzsche's aristocraticism as
irrelevant, uninteresting, or trivial (NCD, p.170). The
[strategy]{.underline} of my work [has been]{.underline} to take up this
challenge, not by reiterating or renewing defenses of egalitarianism but
by [trying to show that [democracy need not be committed to]{.mark}
traditional [egalitarian rhetoric]{.mark} and so [can approach]{.mark} a
Nietzschean [comfort with social stratification]{.mark}]{.underline} in
ways that Nietzsche did not expect or think through.

Appel is right in calling to account selective appropriations of
Nietzsche by postmodern democrats who ignore or sidestep his elitism.
Few writers who celebrate difference and democratic openness in
Nietzsche's name have embraced his affirmation of excellence. There is
difference and then there is difference. [Excellence is a form of
difference that implies gradations and judgments concerning superior and
inferior, better and worse performances. Many have embraced a
Nietzschean openness to difference on behalf of a generalized liberation
of diverse life styles and modes of self-creation.]{.underline}19 [Such
a generalized emancipation]{.underline}, however, [would repulse
Nietzsche]{.underline}. He was [interested in fostering special
individuals and high achievements.]{.underline} I wonder whether certain
postmodern celebrations of difference conceal a kind of egalitarianism
in their avoidance or suppression of Nietzsche's clear comfort with
social stratification. And [[it is important]{.underline}]{.mark}, in my
view, [[to sustain]{.mark} a sense of [excellence that is **vital for
both democratic politics and cultural
production**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [Excellence and democracy are
compatible as long as excellence is understood in a contextual and
performative sense, rather than a substantive sense of permanent,
pervasive, or essential superiority.]{.underline}

I argue for a meritocratic sense of apportional justice modeled on
Aristotle's conception of justice in the Politics (1280a10--15).21 What
is usually missed in Aristotle's formulation is that [[**sometimes it is
just to treat people unequally**,]{.mark} if they are unequal in a
certain attribute relevant to a certain context.]{.underline} For
example, [it is [just to deny children the right to vote since they do
not]{.mark} have the [maturity to engage in political
practice]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, we can grant praise, status,
even privilege to certain performances in social and political life as
long as they exhibit appropriate levels of distinction that fit the
circumstances. We can still be "democratic" in opening opportunity to
all to prove themselves, without assuming fixed or protected locations
of excellence. Yet [we can be "aristocratic" in apportioning appropriate
judgments of superiority and inferiority]{.underline}, depending on the
context, [and thus we can avoid what Nietzsche took to be the most
insidious feature of egalitarianism, resentment in the face of
excellence]{.underline}. We can also borrow from Nietzsche's denial of a
substantial self on behalf of a pluralized sphere of actions (see BGE
19--21) in order to keep the contextual apportionment of excellence open
both between and within selves, so as not to slip into any essentialist
aristocratic confidences about superior selves per se.

[What is helpful to democratic political philosophy in
appropriating]{.underline} a [Nietzschean comfort with stratification is
that [we are no longer bedeviled by]{.mark} puzzles surrounding
so-called "[democratic elitism]{.mark}]{.underline}[." [Whenever
democratic practice]{.underline}]{.mark} [has [exhibited unequal
distributions]{.mark}]{.underline} of power, authority, function, or
influence, [it has [seemed to be incompatible with democratic ideals
because equality has usually been]{.mark} the [baseline]{.mark}
principle defining democratic life]{.underline}. But [[as long as
opportunities are open]{.mark} in a democratic society, a
[meritocratic]{.mark}, contextual [apportionment of different
roles]{.mark} and performances [need not seem
undemocratic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such [phenomena as representative
government, executive and judicial powers, opinion leaders, and
expertise can be understood as appropriate arrangements in political
practice.]{.underline} One way to ascertain this is to realize that
**[the [only way to guarantee]{.mark} purely [egalitarian practices
would be to have all]{.mark} political [decisions]{.mark} produced
[by]{.mark} direct [tally of all citizens]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or to
have political offices distributed by lot. Any CONTINUED - NO TEXT

CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

reservations about such prospects will open space for a nonoxymoronic
conception of democratic elitism.

[Democratic politics can avoid many of the difficulties attached to
egalitarian assumptions by trading the notion of "equal respect" for
"[agonistic respect]{.mark}."]{.underline}24 I believe that the
**[latter notion [can capture all of the practical features of
egalitarianism without]{.mark} the [theoretical puzzles]{.mark}
concerning how and in what sense human beings are
"equal]{.underline}**." Nietzsche had a strong case that traditional
egalitarian ideals were animated and prepared by transcendent warrants
that are no longer philosophically viable. He thought that such a
critique would doom democracy and open the way for an aristocracy of
artisttyrants, whose selective agon would create cultural and political
values that would guide humanity and be liberated from metaphysical
fictions. Any democratic appropriation of Nietzsche must face the
question of how and whether the agon can be extended to the body politic
and still be viably democratic and Nietzschean in significant senses.

My contention is that Nietzsche's aristocratic, artistic agon applied to
politics is either unworkable or itself susceptible to a Nietzschean
suspicion (or both). We need a distinction between: 1) the
aristocracy-democracy encounter in the cultural sphere pertaining to
matters of creativity and normalcy, excellence and mediocrity; and 2)
the aristocracy-democracy encounter in the political sphere pertaining
to the formation of institutions, actual political practices, the
justification of coercion, and the extent of sovereignty. I maintain
that Nietzsche's aristocraticism is defensible regarding the first
encounter but not so regarding the second encounter. How would a
Nietzschean political elite be identified? How would their "rule" be set
up? What would their rule entail? What would be their function? How
would their creative genius and production apply to normal political
matters of governance such as economic policies, criminal justice,
national defense, the everyday needs of citizens, and so on? More
pointedly, the kind of closure and unchecked power implied in political
authoritarianism seems to run afoul of the nonfoundational openness of
Nietzsche's own perspectivism and agonism.

Perhaps one could argue for a coexistence of a Nietzschean cultural
elite and a democratic egalitarian politics. Some of Nietzsche's own
remarks suggest as much (see HAH I,438 and KSA 10, p.244). One passage
seems to imply that a fortified democratic egalitarianism would spur
even higher forms of creativity (BGE 242), which would be consistent
with Nietzsche's overall agonistics, in the sense that part of
creativity is a resistance to, and dissatisfaction with, the established
norm. Nietzschean cultural creators could simply coexist with a
democratic polity, even be given some honor, yet not be given unchecked
political power. A restricted agon might be appropriate for the arts,
let's say, but context is everything. The context of political practices
and milieus is such that artistic genius seems out of place.

Such an interpretive outcome might be satisfying, but I would not want
to establish it by separating the cultural and political spheres, as
some would be happy to do in order to either preserve democratic ideals
from Nietzsche's critique or rescue Nietzsche from reprobation by
sidestepping his frightful political remarks or decoding them as simply
metaphors for self-creation. I think that Nietzsche's attack on
democracy ought to be challenged, but not by reasserting democratic
traditions, but by showing that much of Nietzsche's cultural and
philosophical outlook is compatible with, even constitutive of, much of
democratic politics. So the distinction between cultural and political
spheres allows us to challenge some of Nietzsche's political vision; but
overlaps between the spheres show that Nietzsche's authoritarianism is
weakened by his own philosophical orientation, and that democratic
political life can exhibit certain creative, nonegalitarian, and
agonistic elements to a degree that may warrant calling it Nietzschean
enough to support a democratic appropriation of Nietzsche (thus
answering Appel's challenge). Assuming that politics should not be
restricted and reserved for an elite, but open to the participation of
all citizens, can we retain a sense of respect and political rights in
appropriating Nietzsche for democracy? I think so. In fact, Nietzschean
conceptions of agonistics and nonfoundational openness can go a long way
toward articulating and defending democratic practices without the
problems attaching to traditional principles of equality.

[If political respect implies inclusiveness and an open regard for the
rightful participation of others, an agonistic model of politics can
underwrite respect without the need for substantive conceptions of
equality or even something like "equal regard]{.underline}." I have
already mentioned that agonistics can be seen as a fundamentally social
phenomenon. Since the self is formed in and through tensional relations
with others, then any annulment of my Other would be an annulment of
myself. Radical agonistics, then, discounts the idea of sheer autonomy
and self-constitution. [Such a tensional sociality can much more readily
affirm the place of the Other in social relations than can modern models
of subject-based freedom]{.underline}. Moreover, the structure of an
agon conceived as a contest can readily underwrite political principles
of fairness. [[Not only do I need an Other to prompt]{.mark} my own
[achievement, but]{.mark} the [significance of any "victory]{.mark}" I
might achieve demands an able opponent. As in athletics, defeating an
incapable or incapacitated competitor winds up being
meaningless]{.underline}. So I [should not only will the presence of
others in an agon,]{.underline} I **[should also want that they be able
adversaries, that they have opportunities and capacities to succeed in
the contest. And I should be able to honor the winner of a fair
contest]{.underline}**. Such is the logic of competition that contains a
host of normative features, which might even include active provisions
for helping people in political contests become more able
participants.25 In addition, agonistic respect need not be associated
with something like positive regard or equal worth, a dissociation that
can go further in facing up to actual political conditions and
problematic connotations that can attach to liberal dispositions. Again
allow me to quote my previous work.

Democratic respect forbids exclusion, it demands inclusion; but respect
for the Other as other can avoid a vapid sense of "tolerance," a sloppy
"relativism," or a misplaced spirit of "neutrality." Agonistic respect
allows us to simultaneously affirm our beliefs and affirm our opponents
as worthy com petitors in public discourse. Here we can speak of respect
without ignoring the fact that politics involves perpetual disagreement,
and we have an adequate answer to the question "Why should I respect a
view that I do not agree with?" In this way beliefs about what is best
(aristos) can be coordinated with an openness to other beliefs and a
willingness to accept the outcome of an open competition among the full
citizenry (demos). Democratic respect, therefore, is a dialogical
mixture of affirmation and negation, a political bearing that entails
giving all beliefs a hearing, refusing any belief an ultimate warrant,
and perceiving one's own viewpoint as agonistically implicated with
opposing viewpoints. In sum, we can combine 1) the historical tendency
of democratic movements to promote free expression, pluralism, and
liberation from traditional constraints, and 2) a Nietzschean
perspectivism and agonistic respect, to arrive at a postmodern model of
democracy that provides both a nonfoundational openness and an
atmosphere of civil political discourse.26 An agonistic politics
construed as competitive fairness can sustain a robust conception of
political rights, not as something "natural" possessed by an original
self, but as an epiphenomenal, procedural notion conferred upon citizens
in order to sustain viable political practice. Constraints on speech,
association, access, and so on, simply insure lopsided political
contests. We can avoid metaphysical models of rights and construe them
as simply social and political phenomena: social in the sense of
entailing reciprocal recognition and obligation; political in the sense
of being guaranteed and enforced by the state. We can even defend
so-called positive rights, such as a right to an adequate education, as
requisite for fair competition in political discourse. Rights themselves
can be understood as agonistic in that a right-holder has a claim
against some treatment by others or for some provision that might be
denied by others. In this way rights can be construed as balancing power
relations in social milieus, as a partial recession of one's own power
on behalf of the power of others---which in fact is precisely how
Nietzsche in an early work described fairness and rights (D 112). And,
as is well known, the array of rights often issues conflicts of
different and differing rights, and political life must engage in the
ongoing balancing act of negotiating these tensions, a negotiation
facilitated by precisely not CONTINUED - NO TEXT REMOVED\...

defining rights as discrete entities inviolably possessed by an
originating self. Beyond political rights, a broader conception of
rights, often designated as human rights as distinct from political
practice, can also be defended by way of the kind of nonfoundational,
negative sense of selfhood inspired by Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, the
self is a temporal openness infused with tragic limits, rather than some
metaphysical essence, stable substance, or eternal entity. A via
negativa can be utilized to account for rights as stemming not from what
we are but from what we are not. So much of abusive or exclusionary
treatment is animated by confident designations and reductions as to
"natures" having to do with race, gender, class, role, character, and so
on. Nonfoundational challenges to "identity" may seem unsettling, but if
we consider how identities figure in injustices, a good deal of work can
be done to reconfigure rights as based in resistance. It is difficult to
find some positive condition that can justify rights and do so without
excluding or suppressing some other conditions. But a look at human
history and experience can more readily understand rights and freedom as
emerging out of the irrepressible tendency of human beings to resist and
deny the adequacy of external attributions as to what or who they "are."
It may be sufficient to defend rights simply in terms of the human
capacity to say No.

Appel insists that a radical agonistics is a significant threat to
democratic ideals and principles. Although he does little to develop how
and why this may be so, the charge raises important questions facing
postmodern, and particularly Nietzschean, approaches to democratic
politics. In my work I have tried to face this question, admit the
difficulty, and suggest a "tragic" model of democratic openness, to
borrow from Nietzsche's interest in tragedy.27 Many democratic theorists
insist that politics must be grounded in secure principles, which
themselves are incontestable, so as to rule out anti-democratic voices
from having their day and possibly undermining democratic procedures or
results. A radically agonistic, open conception of democracy that simply
invites any and all parties to compete for favor seems utterly
decisionist, with no justification beyond its contingent enactment. But
from a historical perspective, despite metaphysical pretenses in some
quarters, democratic foundings have in fact emerged out of the "abyss"
of conventions and decisional moments.28 And with the prospect of a
constitutional convention in our system, it is evident from a
performative standpoint that any results are actually possible in a
democracy, even anti-democratic outcomes (not likely, but surely
possible). The "tragedy" is that democracy could die at its own hands.
Foundationalists would call such an outcome contradictory, but a tragic
conception would see it as a possibility intrinsic to the openness of
democratic practice.

Can there be more than a simply negative register in such a tragic
conception? I think so. Just as, for Nietzsche, the tragic allows us to
be sensitized and energized for the fragile meanings of existence, thus
enhancing life, a tragic politics could wean us from false comforts in
foundations and open us to the urgent finite conditions of political
life in an enhanced way. And even if one conceded the existence of
foundational self-evident political principles, would the force of such
principles by themselves necessarily be able to prevent non-democratic
outcomes? If not, the force of such principles would be restricted to
the solace of intellectual rectitude that can comfort theorists while
the walls are coming down. The nonexistence of foundational guarantees
surely does not prevent one from living and fighting for democratic
ideals. What is to be said of someone who, in the absence of a
guarantee, would hesitate to act or be obstructed from acting or see
action as tainted or less than authentic? Nietzsche would take this as
weakness. The most profound element in Nietzsche's conceptions of will
to power, agonistics, and eternal recurrence, in my view, can be put in
the following way. [For Nietzsche, to act in the world is always to act
in the midst of otherness, of resistances or obstacles. Hence [to dream
of action without otherness is to annul action.]{.mark} To affirm one's
Other as necessarily constitutive of oneself is not only to affirm the
full field of action]{.underline} (which is the sense of eternal
recurrence), but also to affirm action as action, that is to say, a real
move in life amidst real resistances, as opposed to the fantasy of
self-sufficient, fully free, uncontested occurrences born in Western
conceptions of divine perfection and continued in various philosophical
models of demonstrative certainty and theoretical governance. [The irony
of a tragically open, agonistic politics is that it need not "infect"
political life but in fact spur it toward the existential environment of
it enactment. And as radically open, an [agonistic politics has]{.mark}
the [virtue of precluding]{.mark} the [silencing]{.mark} of [any
voice]{.mark}, something especially important when [even]{.mark}
purportedly [democratic dispositions are comfortable with
exclusions]{.mark} (frustrated by citizens who will not come around to
being impartial enough, rational enough, secular enough, deliberative
enough, communal enough, virtuous enough, and so on), **thereby
[becoming susceptible to the most]{.mark} ironic and [insidious form of
tyranny done in democracy's name.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Nietzsche's demand for]{.mark} a new, [higher morality]{.mark} can be
harmonized with his perspectivism]{.underline} when one acknowledges,
following Nehamas, that Nietzsche's perspectivism **[[need not imply

is [entirely compatible with the idea that certain perspectives are
better than others]{.underline}. Nietzsche [captures this idea by
rejecting interpretations of the world that represent "only provisional
perspectives, perspectives . . . from]{.underline} some nook, perhaps
from [below, frog perspectives, as it were]{.underline}" (JGB I:2, p.

[Schopenhauer]{.underline}, famously, celebrated *Mitleid* as the
greatest of all virtues and as the sole basis of genuine morality. He
[argued that Mitleid alone is able to overcome our naturally selfish
inclinations and thus to motivate agents to act solely for the
well-being of others]{.underline}, this being *the* characteristic of
morally worthy actions. **[Nietzsche vehemently rejected this elevation
of what he considered to be one of the more regrettable outcomes of
slave morality]{.underline}**. And while objections against *Mitleid*
are voiced throughout Nietzsche's work, *Daybreak* *133* is notable for
its strong polemic against Schopenhauer's psychological explanations of
*Mitleid.* In *Daybreak* *133* Nietzsche alleges that [Schopenhauer
could not possibly have had much relevant experience of Mitleid 'because
he observed and described it so badly'.]{.underline} In particular,
[[Nietzsche]{.mark} utterly [dismisses as 'mere inventions'
Schopenhauer's]{.mark} psychological [foundations of Mitleid such as its
**supposed motivational purity of selflessness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nietzsche [derides]{.mark} the [superficial evidence of selflessness
and claims]{.mark}]{.underline}, in opposition, [that subconsciously
**[we are always]{.mark} and throughout [concerned with our own
selves]{.mark}**. We]{.underline} therefore [[**never** act solely
for]{.mark} the sake of [others]{.mark} but usually harbour a variety of
motives which include]{.underline}, in the case of *Mitleid,* the
**[co-motivations of 'subtle self-defence or even a piece of
revenge'.]{.underline}**

Two sections on, in *Daybreak* *135*, Nietzsche provides us with a
particularly vivid detrimental-to-recipient objection. He states that
[**the mere idea of [being pitied 'evokes a moral shudder']{.mark}** [in
savages]{.mark}]{.underline}, because to savages, [being]{.underline}
still, we are meant to assume, [uncorrupted by conventional morality,
['**to offer pity is as good as to offer
contempt'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[should a defeated enemy
weep]{.mark} and plead then [savages will, out of Mitleid and contempt,
let]{.mark} him [live, humiliated like a dog]{.mark}, while those who
endure suffering with defiant pride repulse Mitleid and thus earn their
admiration and praise.]{.underline}

Regarding the detrimental-to-givers objection, [Nietzsche has
Zarathustra declare]{.underline}, in the by now familiar
detrimental-to-recipients tone, **[that [he badly wronged a sufferer's
pride when he helped him]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} But,
importantly, [Zarathustra]{.underline} also [declares that he washes his
hand and]{.underline} also [wipes clean his soul because he has helped a
sufferer]{.underline}, and he admits, furthermore, that [he feels
ashamed because of the sufferer's shame]{.underline}. These latter
statements show quite conclusively that Nietzsche believed [[agents
pollute and degrade themselves when they show Mitleid]{.mark} and that
Mitleid is therefore detrimental to its givers]{.underline}.

#  A2: Narcissism -- Link Turn  {#a2-narcissism-link-turn .Block-Title}

They conceal narcissism

**Ure 6** (Michael, Prof of German Philosophy @ Monash U, Ph. D in
history of modern social and political theory and modern German
philosophy from Melbourne, 'The Irony of Pity: Nietzsche contra
Schopenhauer and Rousseau', The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 32, 2006,
pp. 68-91, MUSE) Zanezor

[[Nietzsche is]{.mark} intent on **[stripping away pity\'s golden
luster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He builds his case against pitié/Mitleid
largely on the basis of his suspicions about the psychological dynamics
that, so he claims, we can use to lay bare Schopenhauer\'s and
Rousseau\'s gilded rationalizations of this pathos. According to
Nietzsche, the type of [pitié]{.underline}/Mitleid they expound [is
symptomatic of]{.underline} what we might call, drawing on
psychoanalytic terms, [the narcissistic malaise]{.underline}.4 Boldly
stated, he argues that **[as a psychological transaction [Mitleid
satisfies the ego\'s desire to assuage its loss of narcissistic
plenitude]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In making this case, Nietzsche
dramatically \[End Page 68\] reverses their perspective, **[arguing that
[Mitleid should not be understood as an affective bond with the
other]{.mark}, not as a sign of living for others,
[but]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather, [[as a veiled means of restoring
self-affection at the other\'s expense]{.underline}]{.mark}. To show
this he analyzes the moral psychology that underpins the precepts of the
ethics of pity. If Nietzsche\'s psychological analysis is correct, then
[Mitleid is not antithetical to revenge against others but]{.underline},
in fact, [closely linked to one of its subtle shadings and
masks]{.underline}, which he calls [**envy**. \"[In the gilded sheath of
pity]{.mark}]{.underline},\" as he puts it with signature pithiness,
\"[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes stuck **[[the dagger of
envy]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" (AOM 377).

Whereas Rousseau and Schopenhauer claim that Mitleid is the only source
of ethical concern for others, Nietzsche argues that their [psychology
of Mitleid uncritically accepts a paranoid-schizoid splitting of the
object world]{.underline}, to borrow Melanie Klein\'s terminology, [into
the enviable and the pitiable]{.underline}.5 He claims that [because
these forms of pity are generated by]{.underline} a [paranoid-schizoid
psychological constellation, they are better characterized as what we
might call **\"hateship\"** rather than friendship]{.underline}. In this
respect, [Nietzsche sees [in the psychology of the pitier an
immature]{.mark} or infantile [**attempt to resolve** the **narcissistic
malaise**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nietzsche pursues this critique of
Rousseau and Schopenhauer as part of a broader concern that informs his
middle period: his concern with theorizing a mature transformation of
narcissism that does not entail such damaging splitting and projection.

We can reconstruct and elaborate three steps in Nietzsche\'s critical
analysis of the psychological configuration that engenders the type of
pity that Rousseau and Schopenhauer advocate: his claim that
[[pity]{.mark} is deeply complicit in envy and its projective
identifications]{.underline}; that it [**[ultimately tends toward a
diminution of others]{.mark};** and]{.underline}, finally, that the
[twinning of pity and envy in the construction of the object world
blocks our ability to live well with others]{.underline}. In other
words, Nietzsche builds a strong case for reversing Schopenhauer and
Rousseau\'s central, unexamined presumption: he shows that [far from
overcoming our \"colossal egoism]{.underline},\" as Schopenhauer calls
it, **[[pity is a]{.mark} species of pathological [narcissism that
damages]{.mark} the individual\'s [capacity for]{.mark} composing or
\"restoring\" [balanced]{.mark}]{.underline}** (gleichgewicht)
**[[relations with others]{.underline}]{.mark}** (HAH 376). Nietzsche
especially underscores the point that a morality built on these
psychological foundations prevents individuals from developing a subtle,
penetrating, and therapeutically efficacious understanding of another\'s
intrapsychic world and experiences.

In criticizing the ethics of pity, then, Nietzsche specifically targets
the conceptualization of this pathos or affect that lies at the heart of
both Rousseau\'s and Schopenhauer\'s ethical philosophy. In prosecuting
his case against their ethics he brings to bear his method of
\"psychological dissection,\" claiming that it can help explore and
fathom pity\'s intrapsychic significance in a way that sheds new light
on both Rousseau\'s moral pedagogy of pitié and Schopenhauer\'s
metaphysically based ethics of Mitleid (HAH 35, 37). His core thesis is
that pitié/Mitleid, as they conceive it, merely crystallizes the
structure of affects and \[End Page 69\] defenses characteristic of a
psyche ensnared by a primitive means of soothing the narcissistic
wound.6 Contextualized this way, Nietzsche argues, [[Mitleid should be
treated **first and foremost** as a]{.mark} pathological
[stratagem]{.mark} through [which]{.mark} the psyche [seeks narcissistic
gratification]{.mark}]{.underline}. His analysis might stand as an
illustration of his broader claim that moral philosophy should not be
based on or give credence to belief in conceptual oppositions (HAH 1).
For he turns common sense inside out and claims that pitié/Mitleid,
which Schopenhauer identifies as action devoid of \"all egoistic
motivations,\" has its roots in envy.7 It is his psychological
dissections that place Nietzsche several steps ahead of not only
Rousseau and Schopenhauer but also those critics who invoke this
tradition of pity against Nietzsche without carefully examining, as he
does, its theoretical and psychological presuppositions.8 We can orient
ourselves to Nietzsche\'s critique of this type of pity by briefly
examining Rousseau\'s and Schopenhauer\'s very similar treatments of the
origins and worth of pity.

#  A2: Nietzsche = Capitalist Poor Person Hater {#a2-nietzsche-capitalist-poor-person-hater .Block-Title}

**The alt allows for the poor to have real value -- their focus on
economic assets causes extinction**

**Del Caro 4** (Adrian, Associate Vice Chancellor for Graduate
Education, the University of Colorado, Prof of German and Comparative
Literature, Ph. D from U-Minnesota "Grounding the Nietzsche Rhetoric of
Earth," 216-217 google books) Zanezor

We should also make note of the fact that when Nietzsche speaks of the
quotidian and the finite, it is not necessarily in connection with
solitude and certainly it is not in the context of asceticism, which he
justifiably regards as life denying. [Nussbaum is right to emphasize
that Nietzsche's vision of the solitary, struggling individual is
bourgeois and does not address the plight of the poor]{.underline}. who
are present everywhere on the earth and deserve a share in defining any
purported "meaning of the earth." Still, I [regard Nietzsche's choice to
not speak as a champion of the poor as another expression of his view of
nature as superabundance --- he is the prophet of abundance, of a world
(nature) rich in things great and small, of nature as it encourages us
to honor and value the finite]{.underline} --- **[poverty in the natural
sphere does not exist as far as he is concerned, or if it does only as
an exception.]{.underline}** Of course [he admits of poverty in the
social sphere where]{.underline}, it could be argued, [humans who are
out of touch with the finite and intent on hoarding, on bulwarking
against the transient are spreading their disease of consumption and
life denial **across the planet, dragging both the planet and its life
forms down with them**]{.underline}. And [before anyone, socialist or
otherwise, slams the door on the potential of Nietzsche's philosophy of
nature to effect changes in the gross imbalances that cover our planet
in social and economic terms, perhaps greater attention should be paid
to the quotidian Nietzsche, the one who teaches gratitude and modesty
and love for earth]{.underline} --- the last time I looked these were
[not bourgeois values]{.underline}. In other words, I believe Nietzsche
does in fact draw the condition that Nussbaum finds lacking in him, and
that his formulation of the conclusion and his suggestions for change
are miles apart from those of Marx and other socialist and democratic
thinkers, and because they are so different both from Marxian ideology
and the image of Nietzsche which is lodged in people's minds, his
alternatives have only begun to percolate to the surface of Western
cultural consciousness. The [Marxian strategy to redistribute wealth is
one ecumenical vision. Nietzsche's is quite another, but make no
mistake: Nietzsche has an ecumenical vision, a vision for the earth and
lot humanity, and it is neither religious nor
revolutionary.]{.underline} There is no reason to expect that one as
anti- democratic as Nietzsche would have anything resembling a platform
for egalitarian social reform. And by the same token, there is [no
reason to expect that one as adamant about working creatively within the
finite, about affirming the earth with gratitude and humility, would not
be interested in empowering human beings to whatever extent possible to
begin dwelling affirmatively and intelligently on the earth --- there
are other moralities.]{.underline}

Müller-Lauter wants to ensure that Nietzsche's protective
conservationist attitude toward the earth is visible despite what
readers may have been led to believe by Heidegger. In Zarathustra but
also in earlier and later writings ["the earth is supposed to maintain
its own within the whole process of human creation of
meaning."]{.underline} While for Heidcgger the earth becomes "the errant
star" (der lrrstern, also wandering star), Muller-Lauter focuses instead
on Nietzsche's steady insistence that "[humans must remain conscious of
their own earthiness as well as their rule of the earth, in order to
appropriately exercise any such rule]{.underline}."" [Our
earthiness]{.underline} (Erdhafiigkeir) [is precisely the feature of
human being that Nietzsche foregrounds when he alerts us to the presence
of the closest things and the quotidian]{.underline}. Earthiness cannot
be demonstrated by simply professing a view of the earth and installing
oneself as earth ruler --- by [definition earthiness requires a
closeness and bonding with the earth]{.underline}, as suggested by the
German haften, to bond or to stick, as it forms the compound erdiiafiig,
"earthy" or "of the earth." On this accounting [**the poorest, least
refined human** who is bonded to the earth, who displays earthiness in
her living, is as capable of earth affirmation as a professor or a
philosopher.]{.underline}

Something resembling the traditional ethical appeal to an objective
teleology embedded in human nature is the most likely candidate for such
a foundation. Yet it is precisely such an objective ethics which those
who describe Nietzsche as a "genealogist" insist that the author cannot
provide. This impossibility is often attributed to Nietzsche's
"perspectivism"---the doctrine that [[an objective
ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}, like any objective knowledge, [[is
**unattainable** because "there is only a perspective seeing]{.mark},
only a perspective 'knowing']{.underline}" (GM III:12, p. 555).13 Yet
perspectivism obviously does not rule out all critique or revaluation of
our moral evaluations. Alexander Nehamas, for one, argues that [the
great crime of slave morality]{.underline}, the fundamental reason for
its low valuation by Nietzsche, [is a crime against
perspectivism]{.underline} itself. The Christian [[morality of the
weak]{.underline}]{.mark}, he claims, **[[seeks "to conceal and]{.mark}
to [deny its own interpretive status]{.mark}" by [maintaining that it is
true and authoritative for all, weak and strong alike, rather than a

How should we comport ourselves to the suffering we find in our lives?
[When touching a hot stove or confronted with danger, our natural
reactions are to pull back, to flee, to find safety]{.underline}. In
general it seems that we naturally shy away from discomfort and
pain---suffering of all types. The child laments his boring afternoon
and the adult fears the impending death of a parent and the subsequent
anguish the loss will bring, hoping and wishing they will never come.
Suffering, it seems, is quite rightly seen as undesirable. [However:
[When]{.mark} a [misfortune strikes]{.mark} us, [we can overcome
it]{.mark} either [by removing]{.mark} its [cause
or]{.mark}]{.underline} else **[[by changing the effect it has on our
feelings]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is, [by [reinterpreting]{.mark}
the misfortune [as a good, whose benefit may]{.mark} only [later become
clear.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So, should we seek to abolish suffering as far as we can by removing its
cause, or should we attempt to change our attitude toward suffering such
that it is no longer seen as (always) undesirable? Taking Nietzsche
seriously when he says that [it is the meaning of our suffering that has
been the problem]{.underline}, I will attempt to indirectly answer this
question by looking at two possibilities found in Nietzsche for giving
meaning to our suffering. The first possibility concerns a religious
ethic that, according to Nietzsche, views suffering as undesirable, but
which ultimately uses mendacious and deleterious means to provide a
meaning for human suffering. The second possibility concerns the extent
to which we can say [[Nietzsche endorsed]{.mark} the idea of [giving
meaning to suffering through acknowledging its necessary role in
human]{.mark} enhancement and [greatness]{.mark}. Since the religious
ethic sees suffering as undesirable and thus something ultimately to be
avoided]{.underline} (being itself the paradigmatic means for easing
suffering), [and the means it uses to give suffering meaning are
ultimately mendacious]{.underline}, I will argue that if Nietzsche is
significantly correct in both his attack on religious morality and his
alternative ideal, we can take this as evidence that the **[[avoidance
of suffering is not the proper attitude]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to address the question of whether
Nietzsche is significantly correct in this paper. Secondly, [[given
Nietzsche's positive alternative]{.mark}---one [that embraces
the]{.mark} necessary [role]{.mark} suffering has for the enhancement of
human life]{.underline}---I will argue that we can take this as evidence
that [it is our attitude toward suffering that needs to be
modified]{.underline}, i.e., [we should modify so that we no longer see
suffering as something to be avoided]{.underline}. Because of this,
**[[the middle position of avoiding suffering when possible and then
seeing its positive attributes when it does occur does not recommend
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is, [[since]{.mark} it will be
argued that [suffering has a positive]{.mark} and necessary
[role]{.mark} to play, [to seek to avoid it]{.mark} as far as possible
and then to acknowledge its positive aspects when it does occur, **[is
not really to acknowledge and accept suffering's positive and necessary
role]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, as we will see, all of this is
complicated by the issue of the order of rank as found in Nietzsche's
writings.

"To live is to suffer": this is only contentious if we thereby mean that
to live is only to suffer. If we say that [[suffering pervades
life]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [need not mean that there are no
pleasures in life]{.underline}. Even still, [is it true that for every
individual, life will involve suffering]{.underline}? Other than those
who are born and die a quick, painless death shortly thereafter, [the
answer is surely going to be yes]{.underline}. However, before we
rightfully answer whether life automatically means suffering, we should
say what is meant by suffering.

If we look at suffering as a genus, we can say that psychological
suffering and physical suffering are its species. It is easy to think of
examples of both kinds. [[Under mental suffering]{.underline}]{.mark} we
find depression, anxiety, fear, unsatisfied desires (perhaps even desire
itself before it is satisfied), loneliness, loss, anguish, grief,
separation, lamentation, distress, dissatisfaction, rejection, failure,
hopelessness, stress, boredom, ennui, angst, weltschmerz, existential
malaise, and so on. While all of the above admit to degrees, one could
argue that [[any degree]{.mark}]{.underline} of any of them
[[constitutes suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Physical suffering
presents more of a variety]{.mark} of clear and unclear cases of
suffering due to degrees. [There is pain]{.mark}]{.underline}---really
the paradigm of physical suffering ---[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[various [degrees]{.mark}]{.underline} (passing a kidney stone to a
mild, dull, almost unnoticed ache), hunger, which can range from mild
discomfort to actual pain, itching in its various degrees (most of one's
body covered in a rash to the itch one offhandedly scratches), degrees
of being too hot or too cold, being tickled until one cannot stand it,
and so on.

[One becomes acquainted with [more kinds of suffering the longer one
lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [even a very young sheltered child has
experienced many of the above kinds of suffering.]{.underline} At the
very least, [[any child will experience hunger and unsatisfied
desires]{.underline}]{.mark}; in all likelihood, however, a child will
experience much more suffering. [[When]{.mark} we [consider]{.mark} the
[full range of possible]{.mark} human [suffering]{.mark}, it is [hard to
deny that to live is to suffer]{.mark}, as long as [we do not mean that
to live is **only** to suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}.

With the above in mind, [let us]{.underline} now [turn to]{.underline}
the second of our two questions and [Nussbaum's claim]{.underline} \[see
bibliography\] [that Nietzsche lacked 'inner understanding' of the
misery and contingency of suffering.]{.underline} Nussbaum accuses
Nietzsche of insensitivity for the way suffering can be erosive of human
well-being. She argues that Nietzsche had no grasp of the simple truth
that one functions badly when one is hungry and that stoic self-command
is just not possible when suffering from what she terms 'basic
vulnerability'. Nussbaum contrasts 'basic vulnerability', which
comprises deprivations of resources utterly central to human mental,
physical, and intellectual functioning, from 'bourgeois vulnerability'
with its relatively comfortable pains of loneliness, ill health, bad
reputation, and so on. These latter pains, Nussbaum argues, are indeed
painful enough but not such as to impair human functioning altogether.
She insists that Nietzsche simply ignored 'basic vulnerability' since he
apparently believed that even a beggar could be a stoic hero so long as
socialism and *Mitleid* did not keep him weak. Thus [[Nussbaum concludes
that **despite all his famous unhappiness Nietzsche was without 'inner
understanding**]{.mark} **of the ways contingency matters for
virtue'**]{.underline}.

[These]{.underline} are powerful and thought provoking
[[objections]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, I suggest that they somewhat
[[miss their point because Nietzsche was not interested in
virtue]{.mark}, did not address himself to the multitude, and did
not]{.underline}, therefore, [envisage the possibility of members of the
herd growing into stoic heroes]{.underline}. Moreover, [[there is ample
evidence]{.mark} throughout his writings as well as in his letters [that
he was not insensitive to the fact that deprivation]{.mark} -- mental
and physical -- [stunts growth]{.mark} and that severe pain and misery
not only hurts but also harms people]{.underline}. Yet [[Nietzsche
nonetheless]{.underline}]{.mark}, and here lies the highly controversial
nature of his thought, [[refused to grant]{.underline}]{.mark}
suffering, [**[even severe suffering]{.mark}**, the kind of
[significance assigned to it through]{.mark} the influence of
[Christianity]{.mark} and Schopenhauer, which leads]{.underline}, almost
inevitably, to *Mitleid* and hence, Nietzsche feared, [**to erosion of
the will to power of those precious, privileged few by undermining their
confidence in themselves and in their lives**. [The truly objectionable
feature of suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}, Nietzsche holds, [[is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} the well-acknowledged fact [[that it
hurts]{.underline}]{.mark} and harms people, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
the non-acknowledged and deeply deplorable fact **[[that so many
sufferers]{.mark} simply [fail to respond appropriately]{.mark} to their
suffering [and]{.mark} thus [allow themselves to become feeble]{.mark},
impaired, wretched]{.underline}** -- in other words, [they allow
themselves to 'suffer' hurt and harm]{.underline}. We can conclude,
then, that [Nietzsche was [not insensitive to]{.mark} the
[misery]{.mark} and contingency of suffering [but]{.mark} simply
**[refused to accept its alleged wider
significance.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
