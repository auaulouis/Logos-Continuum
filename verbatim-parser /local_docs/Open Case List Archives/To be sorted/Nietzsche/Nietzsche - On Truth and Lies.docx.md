I have taken the liberty, or fascist dictatorial authority, of
underlining phrases, terms, and statements which are, I think, important
and which must not be overlooked if only because they will be mentioned
in the discussion questions I have written at the end of the reading. I
have also created footnotes for any words or terms which I think may not

On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense\
Frederich Nietzsche

1

In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in
innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which [clever
animals invented knowledge]{.underline}. That was the highest and most
mendacious[^1] minute of \"world history\"---yet only a minute. After
nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever
animals had to die.

One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated
sufficiently how wretched, how shadowy and flighty, [how aimless and
arbitrary, the human intellect appears in nature]{.underline}. There
have been eternities when it did not exist; and [when it is done for
again, nothing will have happened]{.underline}. For this intellect has
no further mission that would lead beyond human life. It is human,
rather, and [only its owner and producer gives it such
importance]{.underline}, as if the world pivoted around it. But if we
could communicate with the mosquito, then we would learn that he floats
through the air with the same [self-importance]{.underline}, feeling
within itself the flying center of the world. There is nothing in nature
so despicable or insignificant that it cannot immediately be blown up
like a bag by a slight breath of this power of knowledge; and just as
every porter wants an admirer, the proudest human being, the
philosopher, thinks that he sees on the eyes of the universe
telescopically focused from all sides on his actions and thoughts.[^2]

It is strange that this should be the effect of the intellect, for after
all it was given only as an aid to the most unfortunate, most delicate,
most evanescent beings in order to hold them [for a minute in
existence]{.underline}, from which otherwise, without this gift, they
would have every reason to flee as quickly as Lessing\'s son. \[In a
famous letter to Johann Joachim Eschenburg (December 31, 1778), [Lessing
relates the death of his infant son, who \"understood the world so well
that he left it at the first opportunity]{.underline}.\"\] That
haughtiness which goes with [knowledge]{.underline} and feeling, which
shrouds the eyes and senses of man in a blinding fog, therefore
[deceives him about the value of existence]{.underline} by carrying in
itself the most flattering evaluation of knowledge itself. Its most
universal effect is deception; but even its most particular effects have
something of the same character.

[The intellect, as a means for the preservation of the individual,
unfolds its chief powers in simulation]{.underline}; for this is the
means by which the weaker, less robust individuals preserve themselves,
since they are denied the chance of waging the struggle for existence
with horns or the fangs of beasts of prey. In man this art of
[simulation reaches its peak: here deception, flattering, lying and
cheating, talking behind the back, posing, living in borrowed splendor,
being masked, the disguise of convention, acting a role]{.underline}
before others and before oneself---in short, the constant fluttering
around the single flame of vanity is so much the rule and the law that
almost [nothing is more incomprehensible than how an honest and pure
urge for truth could make its appearance among men]{.underline}. They
are deeply immersed in illusions and dream images; their eye glides only
over the surface of things and sees \"forms\"; their feeling nowhere
lead into truth, but contents itself with the reception of stimuli,
playing, as it were, a game of blindman\'s buff on the backs of things.
Moreover, man permits himself to be lied to at night, his life long,
when he dreams, and his moral sense never even tries to prevent
this---although men have been said to have overcome snoring by sheer
will power.

[What, indeed, does man know of himself!]{.underline} Can he even once
perceive himself completely, laid out as if in an illuminated glass
case? Does not [nature]{.underline} keep much the most from him, even
about his body, to spellbind and confine him in a proud, deceptive
consciousness, far from the coils of the intestines, the quick current
of the blood stream, and the involved tremors of the fibers? She [threw
away the key]{.underline}; and woe to the calamitous curiosity which
might peer just once through a crack in the chamber of consciousness and
look down, and sense that man rests upon the merciless, the greedy, the
insatiable, the murderous, in the indifference of his
ignorance---hanging in dreams, as it were, upon the back of a tiger. In
view of this, [whence in all the world comes the urge for
truth?]{.underline}

Insofar as the individual wants to preserve himself against other
individuals, in a natural state of affairs he employs the intellect
mostly for simulation alone. But because man, out of need and boredom,
wants to exist socially, herd-fashion, he requires a peace pact and he
endeavors to banish at least the very crudest *bellum omni contra omnes*
\[war of all against all\] from his world. This peace pact brings with
it something that looks like the first step toward the attainment of
this enigmatic urge for truth. For now that is fixed which henceforth
shall be [\"truth\"; that is, a regularly valid and obligatory
designation of things is invented]{.underline}, and this [linguistic
legislation]{.underline} also furnishes the first laws of truth: for it
is here that the contrast between truth and lie first originates. [The
liar]{.underline} uses the valid designations, the words, to [make the
unreal appear as real]{.underline}; he says, for example, \"I am rich,\"
when the word \"poor\" would be the correct designation of his
situation. [He abuses the fixed conventions]{.underline} by arbitrary
changes or even by reversals of the names. When he does this in a
self-serving way damaging to others, then society will no longer trust
him but exclude him. Thereby men do not flee from being deceived as much
as from being damaged by deception: [what they hate at this stage is
basically not the deception but the bad, hostile consequences of certain
kinds of deceptions]{.underline}. In a similarly limited way man wants
the truth: [he desires the agreeable life-preserving consequences of
truth, but he is indifferent to pure knowledge, which has no
consequences; he is even hostile to possibly damaging and destructive
truths]{.underline}. And, moreover, what about these conventions of
language? Are they really the products of knowledge, of the sense of
truth? Do the designations and the things coincide? [Is language the
adequate expression of all realities?]{.underline}

[**THIS ENTIRE PARAGRAPH**:]{.underline} Only through forgetfulness can
man ever achieve the illusion of possessing a \"truth\" in the sense
just designated. If he does not wish to be satisfied with truth in the
form of a tautology---that is, with empty shells---then he will forever
buy illusions for truths. What is a word? The image of a nerve stimulus
in sounds. But to infer from the nerve stimulus, a cause outside us,
that is already the result of a false and unjustified application of the
principle of reason. If truth alone had been the deciding factor in the
genesis of language, and if the standpoint of certainty had been
decisive for designations, then how could we still dare to say \"the
stone is hard,\" as if \"hard\" were something otherwise familiar to us,
and not merely a totally subjective stimulation! We separate things
according to gender, designating the tree as masculine and the plant as
feminine. What arbitrary assignments! How far this oversteps the canons
of certainty! We speak of a \"snake\": this designation touches only
upon its ability to twist itself and could therefore also fit a worm.
What arbitrary differentiations! What one-sided preferences, first for
this, then for that property of a thing! The different languages, set
side by side, show that what matters with words is never the truth,
never an adequate expression; else there would not be so many languages.
The \"thing in itself\" (for that is what pure truth, without
consequences, would be) is quite incomprehensible to the creators of
language and not at all worth aiming for. One designates only the
relations of things to man, and to express them one calls on the boldest
metaphors. A nerve stimulus, first transposed into an image---first
metaphor. The image, in turn, imitated by a sound---second metaphor. And
each time there is a complete overleaping of one sphere, right into the
middle of an entirely new and different one. One can imagine a man who
is totally deaf and has never had a sensation of sound and music.
Perhaps such a person will gaze with astonishment at Chladni\'s sound
figures; perhaps he will discover their causes in the vibrations of the
string and will now swear that he must know what men mean by \"sound.\"
It is this way with all of us concerning language; we believe that we
know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees,
colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for
things---metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities.
In the same way that the sound appears as a sand figure, so the
mysterious X of the thing in itself first appears as a nerve stimulus,
then as an image, and finally as a sound. Thus the genesis of language
does not proceed logically in any case, and all the material within and
with which the man of truth, the scientist, and the philosopher later
work and build, if not derived from never-never land, is a least not
derived from the essence of things.

Let us still give special consideration to the formation of concepts.
Every word immediately becomes a concept, inasmuch as it is not intended
to serve as a reminder of the unique and wholly individualized original
experience to which it owes its birth, but must at the same time fit
innumerable, more or less similar cases---which means, strictly
speaking, never equal---in other words, a lot of unequal cases. Every
concept originates through our equating what is unequal. [No leaf ever
wholly equals another, and the concept \"leaf\" is formed through an
arbitrary abstraction from these individual differences, through
forgetting the distinctions; and now it gives rise to the idea that in
nature there might be something besides the leaves which would be
\"leaf\"---some kind of original form after which all leaves have been
woven, marked, copied, colored, curled, and painted, but by unskilled
hands, so that no copy turned out to be a correct, reliable, and
faithful image of the original form.]{.underline} We call a person
\"honest.\" Why did he act so honestly today? we ask. Our answer usually
sounds like this: because of his honesty. Honesty! That is to say again:
the leaf is the cause of the leaves. After all, **[we know nothing of an
essence-like quality]{.underline}** named \"honesty\"; **[we know only
numerous individualized, and thus unequal actions, which we equate by
omitting the unequal and by then calling them]{.underline}** honest
actions. In the end, we distill from them a **[*qualitas occulta*
\[hidden quality\]]{.underline}** with the name of \"honesty.\" We
obtain the concept, as we do the form, by overlooking what is individual
and actual; whereas nature is acquainted with no forms and no concepts,
and likewise with no species, but only with an X which remains
inaccessible and undefinable for us. For [even our contrast between
individual and species is something anthropomorphic]{.underline}[^3]
[and does not originate in the essence of things]{.underline}; although
we should not presume to claim that this contrast does not correspond to
the essence of things: that would of course be a dogmatic assertion and,
as such, would be just as indemonstrable as its opposite.

[What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and
anthropomorphisms---in short, a sum of human relations which have been
enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and
which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people:
truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what
they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins
which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer
as coins.]{.underline}

We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we
have heard only of the obligation imposed by society that it should
exist: [to be truthful means using the **customary**
metaphors]{.underline}---in moral terms: the obligation to lie according
to a fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory for all.
Now man of course forgets that this is the way things stand for him.
Thus he lies in the manner indicated, unconsciously and in accordance
with habits which are centuries\' old; and precisely *by means of this
unconsciousness* and forgetfulness he arrives at his sense of truth.
From the sense that one is obliged to designate one thing as red,
another as cold, and a third as mute, there arises a moral impulse in
regard to truth. The venerability, reliability, and utility of truth is
something which a person demonstrates for himself from the contrast with
the liar, whom no one trusts and everyone excludes. [As a *rational*
being, he now places his behavior under the control of abstractions. He
will no longer tolerate being carried away by sudden impressions, by
intuitions. First he universalizes all these impressions into less
colorful, cooler concepts, so that he can entrust the guidance of his
life and conduct to them.]{.underline} Everything which distinguishes
man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual
metaphors in a schema, and thus to dissolve an image into a concept.
**[For something is possible in the realm of these schemata which could
never be achieved with the vivid first impressions: the construction of
a pyramidal order according to castes and degrees, the creation of a new
world of laws, privileges, subordinations, and clearly marked
boundaries---a new world, one which now confronts that other vivid world
of first impressions as more solid, more universal, better known, and
more human than the immediately perceived world, and thus as the
regulative and imperative world.]{.underline}** Whereas each perceptual
metaphor is individual and without equals and is therefore able to elude
all classification, the great edifice of concepts displays the rigid
regularity of a Roman columbarium and exhales in logic that strength and
coolness which is characteristic of mathematics. Anyone who has felt
this cool breath \[of logic\] will hardly believe that even the
concept---which is as bony, foursquare, and transposable as a die---is
nevertheless [merely the *residue of a metaphor*]{.underline}, and that
the illusion which is involved in the artistic transference of a nerve
stimulus into images is, if not the mother, then the grandmother of
every single concept. But in this conceptual crap game \"truth\" means
using every die in the designated manner, counting its spots accurately,
fashioning the right categories, and never violating the order of caste
and class rank. Just as the Romans and Etruscans cut up the heavens with
rigid mathematical lines and confined a god within each of the spaces
thereby delimited, as within a **templum**, so every people has a
similarly mathematically divided conceptual heaven above themselves and
henceforth thinks that truth demands that each conceptual god be sought
only within *his own* sphere. [Here one may certainly admire man as a
mighty genius of construction, who succeeds in piling an infinitely
complicated dome of concepts upon an unstable foundation, and, as it
were, on running water.]{.underline} Of course, in order to be supported
by such a foundation, his construction must be like one constructed of
spiders\' webs: delicate enough to be carried along by the waves, strong
enough not to be blown apart by every wind. As a genius of construction
man raises himself far above the bee in the following way: whereas the
bee builds with wax that he gathers from nature, man builds with the far
more delicate conceptual material which he first has to manufacture from
himself. In this he is greatly to be admired, but not on account of his
drive for truth or for pure knowledge of things. [When someone hides
something behind a bush and looks for it again in the same place and
finds it there as well, there is not much to praise in such seeking and
finding. Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and finding
\"truth\" within the realm of reason.]{.underline} If I make up the
definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a camel, declare
\"look, a mammal\" I have indeed brought a truth to light in this way,
but it is **[a truth of limited value]{.underline}**. That is to say, it
is a thoroughly anthropomorphic truth which contains not a single point
which would be **[\"true in itself\"]{.underline}** or really and
universally valid apart from man. At bottom, what the investigator of
such truths is seeking is only the metamorphosis of the world into man.
He strives to understand the world as something analogous to man, and
[at best he achieves by his struggles the feeling of
assimilation]{.underline}. Similar to the way in which astrologers
considered the stars to be in man\'s service and connected with his
happiness and sorrow, such an investigator considers the entire universe
in connection with man: the entire universe as the infinitely fractured
echo of one original sound-man; the entire universe as the infinitely
multiplied copy of one original picture-man. His method is to treat man
as the measure of all things, but in doing so he again proceeds from the
error of believing that he has these things \[which he intends to
measure\] immediately before him as mere objects. [He forgets that the
original perceptual metaphors are metaphors and takes them to be the
things themselves.]{.underline}

Only by forgetting this primitive world of metaphor can one live with
any repose, security, and consistency: only by means of the
petrification and coagulation of a mass of images which originally
streamed from the primal faculty of human imagination like a fiery
liquid, [only in the invincible faith that *this* sun, *this* window,
this table is a truth in itself, in short, only by forgetting that he
himself is an *artistically creating* subject, does man live with any
repose, security, and consistency.]{.underline} If but for an instant he
could escape from the prison walls of this faith, his \"self
consciousness\" would be immediately destroyed. It is even a difficult
thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives
an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that **[the
question of which of these perceptions of the world is the more correct
one is quite meaningless, for this would have to have been decided
previously in accordance with the criterion of the *correct perception*,
which means, in accordance with a criterion which is *not available*.
But in any case it seems to me that the correct perception---which would
mean the adequate expression of an object in the subject---is a
contradictory impossibility]{.underline}**. For between two absolutely
different spheres, as between subject and object, there is no causality,
no correctness, and no expression; there is, at most, [an *aesthetic*
relation]{.underline}: I mean, a suggestive transference, a stammering
translation into a completely foreign tongue---for which I there is
required, in any case, a freely inventive intermediate sphere and
mediating force. \"Appearance\" is a word that contains many
temptations, which is why I avoid it as much as possible. For [it is not
true that the essence of things \"appears\" in the empirical
world]{.underline}. A painter without hands who wished to express in
song the picture before his mind would, by means of this substitution of
spheres, still reveal more about the essence of things than does the
empirical world. Even the relationship of a nerve stimulus to the
generated image is not a necessary one. But when the same image has been
generated millions of times and has been handed down for many
generations and finally appears on the same occasion every time for all
mankind, then it acquires at last the same meaning for men it would have
if it were the sole necessary image and if the relationship of the
original nerve stimulus to the generated image were a strictly causal
one. In the same manner, an eternally repeated dream would certainly be
felt and judged to be reality. But the hardening and congealing of a
metaphor guarantees absolutely nothing concerning its necessity and
exclusive justification.

Every person who is familiar with such considerations has no doubt felt
a deep mistrust of all idealism of this sort: just as often as he has
quite early convinced himself of the eternal consistency, omnipresence,
and fallibility of the laws of nature. He has concluded that so far as
we can penetrate here---from the telescopic heights to the microscopic
depths---everything is secure, complete, infinite, regular, and without
any gaps. Science will be able to dig successfully in this shaft
forever, and the things that are discovered will harmonize with and not
contradict each other. How little does this resemble a product of the
imagination, for if it were such, there should be some place where the
illusion and reality can be divined. Against this, the following must be
said: [if each us had a different kind of sense perception---if we could
only perceive things now as a bird, now as a worm, now as a plant, or if
one of us saw a stimulus as red, another as blue, while a third even
heard the same stimulus as a sound---then no one would speak of such a
regularity of nature, rather, nature would be grasped only as a creation
which is subjective in the highest degree.]{.underline} After all, what
is a law of nature as such for us? [We are not acquainted with it in
itself, but only with its effects, which means in its relation to other
laws of nature---which, in turn, are known to us only as sums of
relations. Therefore all these relations always refer again to others
and are thoroughly incomprehensible to us in their essence. All that we
actually know about these laws of nature is what we ourselves bring to
them---time and space, and therefore relationships of succession and
number.]{.underline} But everything marvelous about the laws of nature,
everything that quite astonishes us therein and seems to demand
explanation, everything that might lead us to distrust idealism: all
this is completely and solely contained within the mathematical
strictness and inviolability of our representations of time and space.
But we produce these representations in and from ourselves with the same
necessity with which the spider spins. If we are forced to comprehend
all things only under these forms, then it ceases to be amazing that in
all things we actually comprehend nothing but these forms. For they must
all bear within themselves the laws of number, and it is precisely
number which is most astonishing in things. All that conformity to law,
which impresses us so much in the movement of the stars and in chemical
processes, coincides at bottom with those properties which we bring to
things. Thus it is we who impress ourselves in this way. In conjunction
with this, it of course follows that the artistic process of metaphor
formation with which every sensation begins in us already presupposes
these forms and thus occurs within them. The only way in which the
possibility of subsequently constructing a new conceptual edifice from
metaphors themselves can be explained is by the firm persistence of
these original forms That is to say, this conceptual edifice is an
imitation of temporal, spatial, and numerical relationships in the
domain of metaphor.

2

We have seen how it is originally *language* which works on the
construction of concepts, a labor taken over in later ages by *science*.
Just as the bee simultaneously constructs cells and fills them with
honey, so **[science works unceasingly on this great columbarium of
concepts, the graveyard of perceptions. It is always building new,
higher stories and shoring up, cleaning, and renovating the old cells;
above all, it takes pains to fill up this monstrously towering framework
and to arrange therein the entire empirical world, which is to say, the
anthropomorphic world]{.underline}**. Whereas the man of action binds
his life to reason and its concepts so that he will not be swept away
and lost, the scientific investigator builds his hut right next to the
tower of science so that he will be able to work on it and to find
shelter for himself beneath those bulwarks which presently exist. And he
requires shelter, for there are frightful powers which continuously
break in upon him, powers which oppose scientific truth with completely
[different kinds of \"truths\"]{.underline} which bear on their shields
the most varied sorts of emblems.

**[THIS ENTIRE PARAGRAPH:]{.underline}** The drive toward the formation
of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a
single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense
with man himself. This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely
subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is constructed as
its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It seeks a new
realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in myth
and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual
categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors,
and metonymies. It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion
the world which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as
colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and
eternally new as the world of dreams. Indeed, it is only by means of the
rigid and regular web of concepts that the waking man clearly sees that
he is awake; and it is precisely because of this that he sometimes
thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of concepts is torn by
art. Pascal is right in maintaining that if the same dream came to us
every night we would be just as occupied with it as we are with the
things that we see every day. \"If a workman were sure to dream for
twelve straight hours every night that he was king,\" said Pascal, \"I
believe that he would be just as happy as a king who dreamt for twelve
hours every night that he was a workman.\" In fact, because of the way
that myth takes it for granted that miracles are always happening, the
waking life of a mythically inspired people---the ancient Greeks, for
instance---more closely resembles a dream than it does the waking world
of a scientifically disenchanted thinker. When every tree can suddenly
speak as a nymph, when a god in the shape of a bull can drag away
maidens, when even the goddess Athena herself is suddenly seen in the
company of Peisastratus driving through the market place of Athens with
a beautiful team of horses---and this is what the honest Athenian
believed---then, as in a dream, anything is possible at each moment, and
all of nature swarms around man as if it were nothing but a masquerade
of the gods, who were merely amusing themselves by deceiving men in all
these shapes.

[But man has an invincible inclination to allow himself to be deceived
and is, as it were, enchanted with happiness when the rhapsodist tells
him epic fables as if they were true, or when the actor in the theater
acts more royally than any real king.]{.underline} So long as it is able
to deceive without *injuring*, that master of deception, the intellect,
is free; it is released from its former slavery and celebrates its
Saturnalia. It is never more luxuriant, richer, prouder, more clever and
more daring. With creative pleasure it throws metaphors into confusion
and displaces the boundary stones of abstractions, so that, for example,
it designates the stream as \"the moving path which carries man where he
would otherwise walk.\" The intellect has now thrown the token of
bondage from itself. At other times it endeavors, with gloomy
officiousness, to show the way and to demonstrate the tools to a poor
individual who covets existence; it is like a servant who goes in search
of booty and prey for his master. But now it has become the master and
it dares to wipe from its face the expression of indigence. In
comparison with its previous conduct, everything that it now does bears
the mark of dissimulation, just as that previous conduct did of
distortion. The free intellect copies human life, but it considers this
life to be something good and seems to be quite satisfied with it. [That
immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings
his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a
scaffolding and toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated
intellect.]{.underline} And when it smashes this framework to pieces,
throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic
fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it is
demonstrating that it has no need of these makeshifts of indigence and
that it will now be [guided by intuitions rather than by
concepts.]{.underline} There is no regular path which leads from these
intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions.
[There exists **no word** for these intuitions]{.underline}; when man
sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in [forbidden
metaphors]{.underline} and in unheard-of combinations of concepts. He
does this so that by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers
he may at least correspond **[creatively]{.underline}** to the
impression of the powerful present intuition.

There are ages in which **[the rational man and the intuitive
man]{.underline}** stand side by side, **[the one in fear of intuition,
the other with scorn for abstraction. The latter is just as irrational
as the former is inartistic.]{.underline}** They both desire to rule
over life: the former, by knowing how to meet his principle needs by
means of foresight, prudence, and regularity; the latter, by
disregarding these needs and, as an \"overjoyed hero,\" counting as real
only that life which has been [disguised as]{.underline} illusion and
beauty. Whenever, as was perhaps the case in ancient Greece, the
intuitive man handles his weapons more authoritatively and victoriously
than his opponent, then, under favorable circumstances, a culture can
take shape and art\'s mastery over life can be established. All the
manifestations of such a life will be accompanied by this dissimulation,
this disavowal of indigence, this glitter of metaphorical intuitions,
and, in general, this immediacy of deception: neither the house, nor the
gait, nor the clothes, nor the clay jugs give evidence of having been
invented because of a pressing need. It seems as if they were all
intended to express an exalted happiness, an Olympian cloudlessness,
and, as it were, a playing with seriousness. [The man who is guided by
concepts and abstractions only succeeds by such means in warding off
misfortune, without ever gaining any happiness for himself from these
abstractions. And while he aims for the greatest possible freedom from
pain, the intuitive man, standing in the midst of a culture, already
reaps from his intuition a harvest of continually inflowing
illumination, cheer, and redemption---in addition to obtaining a defense
against misfortune]{.underline}. To be sure, he suffers more intensely,
*when* he suffers; he even suffers more frequently, since he does not
understand how to learn from experience and keeps falling over and over
again into the same ditch. He is then just as irrational in sorrow as he
is in happiness: he cries aloud and will not be consoled. How
differently the stoical man who learns from experience and governs
himself by concepts is affected by the same misfortunes! [This man,
who]{.underline} at other times [seeks]{.underline} nothing but
sincerity, truth, [freedom from deception]{.underline}, and protection
against ensnaring surprise attacks, now executes a masterpiece of
deception: he [executes his masterpiece of deception in misfortune, as
the other type of man executes his in times of happiness.]{.underline}
He wears no quivering and changeable human face, but, as it were, a mask
with dignified, symmetrical features. He does not cry; he does not even
alter his voice. When a real storm cloud thunders above him, he wraps
himself in his cloak, and with slow steps he walks from beneath it.

**[\| Questions to consider and discuss \| Definite answers are optional
if not fruitless \|]{.underline}**

\(1\) Nietzsche wrote that "clever animals invented knowledge." Does
Nietzsche believe and/or claim in this writing that (transcendental)
knowledge (inherently) exists? Do things merely happen and do humans
just attach words to these past events in order to give them some sort
of significance? Is knowledge a social construct which requires mass
consensus for it to be 'true' or for it to 'hold weight' / be accepted
as 'true'? If the solar system was sucked into a black hole, where would
the truth/knowledge/facts go? Were these facts merely private brain
states (certain neurons firing in our head) which fooled us into
thinking we were correct? Do other living creatures use/believe in
knowledge or are they creatures of habit, experience, and learning? How
are humans any different? Is there a difference between being
knowledgeable and being intelligent? If Nietzsche doesn't believe in
truth, do you think he believe this essay of his is true? If yes, why?
If no, do you think he cares?

\(2\) Nietzsche states that human intellect appears aimless, arbitrary,
wretched, shadowy, and flighty *in nature*. What might Nietzsche mean by
his use of "nature"? Do you think Nietzsche believes that humans are
part of nature, but that by acting unlike any other life form we are
unknowingly fooling ourselves and in the process deluding ourselves from
our true Being and/or deluding ourselves from who/what we truly are? Is
there a clear line to be drawn between humanity and nature? If yes,
what's your reason and does your reason collapse into the thought that
humans are somehow superior to all other creatures because only we are
able to display the fact that we created knowledge -- (we read books,
draw cave paintings, and we talk!)? If no, does that mean that roads,
cars, power plants, and cities are just as natural as the anthill you
negligibly destroyed on your walk to your car yesterday? How about as
natural as the complicated cells within a tree's leaves? Does this mean
that prescription drugs or drugs created in a lab are just as natural as
the poison that grows on a frog's back or the vegetables that grow in
your garden?

\(3\) Nietzsche claims that "only its owner and producer gives it such
importance." While Nietzsche, in this context, is only referencing human
intellect and human knowledge, do you think Nietzsche would also say the
same for everything else in existence? Is there anything in existence
which has an inherent inviolability or some inherent importance? If yes,
what? If no, why not? Why are pieces of green paper with Benjamin
Franklin on them important? They didn't fall from the heavens -- they
came from a fancy printing press somewhere in the USA. Is money only
valuable because we attach value to it? What about becoming a CEO of a
Fortune 500 Company? Is having a family and a house with a white picket
fence only worth striving for because we attach value to it? Is God only
worth worshipping because we attached value to it? Because others
attached value to it? What about humans? How are we significantly
different from the dead pig you ate for breakfast? Unrelatedly, why do
others use the word "bacon" or "pork"? Is it a psychologically
distancing mechanism to free them from the guilt of supporting the
killing of an innocent creature with which they may have more in common
than the Hmong immigrant who made their pho at an eatery last night
which just so happened to have dead pig in it? Did the
conscious/sentient/pain-feeling-creature choose to be born as a pig? Did
you choose to be born as a human? Was this 'forced choice' arbitrary?
Are the vegetarians ETHICALLY correct? If they are, should we even care
because bacon tastes really, really, really good? Even if bacon tastes
like meh, should be even care about ethics which concern other life
forms? It's not like the pigs are knowledgeable enough to fight for
rights they may invented for themselves. Survival of the fittest; and
most delicious!

\(4\) Why do you think Nietzsche, or whoever titled this essay, chose
the term "extra-moral" and not amoral, moral, non-moral, post-moral,
anti-moral, immoral, et cetera? What do you think the term "extra-moral"
means, especially in relation to all of these other options? What are
the similarities and dissimilarities between all these terms? Do you
think any are synonymous with each other? Why was the term "moral" used
and not "ethical" or "inter-subjectively defined rules"?

\(5\) What's the difference between the truth and the not-truth? Any
statement, whether it's true or false, uses words and are
written/spoken/uttered by something so at the very least two statements
have more in common even if their 'truth value' may not be congruous.
Why is what your little sister says any more true than what the raccoon
says/yells/squeaks when it is caught nom nom noming on some fine trash
outside your house? Both are sound waves, both enter your ears, both are
understood by you in some regard, and both are said as the result of
some external stimuli. Is it because you yourself 'added value' to your
sister's sentence? Value in this case being "the quality of truth". Is
it possible to be truthful even when you're lying? Don't the tone of
your voice, the context in which you are speaking, the
register/vocabulary you're using, the audience you're speaking to, and
the subject on which you are speaking also carry significant data which
are relevant to whether you should assign a 'truth value' to the
sentence? If I mockingly say "oh yeah, 1 plus 1 is totally 3" in a
valley girl accent, is not what I am saying true (that 1 plus 1 actually
isn't 3) even though the literal words I am using seem to indicate
otherwise? Why even care to assign a 'truth value' to something? Why not
just use one's preferences (this sentence agrees with me; not the other
way around!)? So, to return to the first question in (5) -- do we only
know the meanings of terms in relation to their opposite? Do we only
know what "truth" means because we know what "lie" means? What about
barbarianism and civilized? Euphoria and depression? Do we only know Big
Macs taste horrible after we've eaten foie gras and lobster? In other
words, can our knowledge / information we use to judge the world only
come from experience?

\(6\) Nietzsche asserts that a "leaf" is merely defined by its "leafy /
leaf-like characteristics." Is this a tautology? Is this true? Are there
any true sentences which cannot be reworded as tautologies? For
instance, if I say "Barack Obama is the 44^th^ president of the United
States" and if my/our definition of the term "the 44^th^ president of
the United States" is "Barack Obama" isn't my original sentence really
just saying "Barack Obama is Barack Obama"? Is something odd,
interesting, thought-provoking, hilarious, or troubling about this? What
concepts, terms, or nouns do we use (like leaves, persons, aggression,
cool/popular, sexy, and truth(!)) which aren't the result of, as
Nietzsche says, a process wherein we "know only numerous individualized,
and thus unequal" actions/descriptions/qualities/experiences which we
then "equate by omitting the unequal and by then calling them" a
singular word/term such as "leaf," "person," "aggressive," "cool,"
"sexy," and "TRUE." No two snowflakes are alike, so why don't we just
call a snowflake we catch on our tongues "a cold, white, frozen molecule
of water that I tasted at 1:54pm on 12/25/2008"? Does this very
description fall into the same trap Nietzsche describes (because it uses
words/terms/concepts)? Is it possible to escape this trap? Is this a
problem? Are not concepts just tools for a form of shorthand
communication? How does mathematics fit into this? Are the concepts of
"1" and "743,556,732" 'pure'? Is not the number/concept of "3" only
meaningful in relation to three 1s or all the other numbers in some way?
What about mathematical laws, equations, axiomatic truths, algorithms,
and functions?

\(7\) Nietzsche speaks of our thinking and our concepts creating
"clearly marked boundaries" amongst things in the universe. Are any of
these boundries 'true'? Are they arbitrary? Do these boundaries take
some arbitrary quality and then assert that this quality is somehow
important enough (arbitrarily important) in order to warrant the
creation of a boundary? What's the boundary in other people's minds
between an insane person and a sane person? Between a dog and a human?
Between a squirrel and a tree? Between water and lava? Between a
supernova/stardust and gravity? Between you and me? Are any differences
you \[care to\] notice or \[care to\] care about arbitrary? If you
categorize everything as itself and don't lump it under a category such
as "Person" or "Tree" do you categorize anything? Is this method of
categorizing the world or is this schemata of the world equally
arbitrary? Is it preferable?

[^1]: "Mendacious" means untruthful, dishonest, deceitful, lying,
    unreliable, inaccurate, and untrue. "Mendacious" is an incredibly
    appropriate word given the context, but to be fair this is a
    translation and me finding the original German version and doing an
    etymological analysis wouldn't be worth the effort.

[^2]: "thinks that he sees on the eyes of the universe telescopically
    focused from all sides on his actions and thoughts" = essentially,
    those who claim they are unbiased are still biased. For instance,
    even if a journalist never inserts her opinion into a column she
    wrote and even if she only uses facts (x happened here because y and
    it caused z), the mere fact that she wrote that column and that it
    was published says something about her and/or the managing editor.
    At the very least she's glad that the story is being widely read by
    people even if her opinion of it isn't explicitly stated since,
    well, don't the facts of the story unambiguously tell you what to
    believe!?

[^3]: According to Wikipedia "anthropomorphism" is "any attribution of
    human characteristics (or characteristics assumed to belong only to
    humans) to non-human animals, non-living things, phenomena, material
    states, objects or abstract concepts, such as spirits or deities. At
    the very least, everything has one quality in common: it exists.
    Even unicorns and ghosts, which may not exist on this planet Earth
    or in our universe, exist within our thoughts and our thoughts are
    reducible to some sort of brain chemistry or firing of neurons. So
    everything exists! It just may not exist outside our mind in
    material form. Is this meaningful? Even if not meaningful, it is
    still a sense of the word "exist" even if it's not the most common
    of usages.
