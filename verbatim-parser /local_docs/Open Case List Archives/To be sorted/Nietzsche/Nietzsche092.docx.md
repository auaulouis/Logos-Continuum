# notes

There are two basic 1NCs:

1)  The Security version---best against teams primarily relying on
    hegemony, terrorism, economic collapse or something similar as the
    advantage. The alternative to this version claims that accepting the
    world as inevitably dangerous and accepting it as it is is life
    affirming and dodges the escalating war on difference that we are
    trapped in now.

2)  The Non-security version---this is best against teams that claim
    poverty or ethics advantages. You should tailor the 1NC to include
    more specific links---we cut links to lots of the specific aff
    claims re: ethics. The alternative with this version claims that a
    refusal of specific morals enables a more radically inclusive/less
    dogmatic politics.

**The world we live in is inevitably relativistic---mutually exclusive
value systems mean that there will always be war. When the mission of
statehood is extended to include democracy promotion or cosmopolitanism
it escalates that warfare, as those who have embraced the liberal order
feel justified in waging war on all outsiders.**

**Rasch, 03** (Cultural Critique 54 (2003) 120-147, [William
Rasch](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#top)
is the Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana
University, Human Rights as Geopolitics  Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form
of American Supremacy).

[In the past, we/they,]{.underline} neighbor/foreigner, [friend/enemy
polarities were inside/outside distinctions that produced a plurality of
worlds, separated by physical and cultural borders. When these worlds
collided, it was not always a pretty picture, but it was often possible
to maintain the integrity of the we/they distinction, even to regulate
it by distinguishing between domestic and foreign affairs. If \"they\"
differed, \"we\" did not always feel ourselves obliged to make \"them\"
into miniature versions of \"us,\"]{.underline} to Christianize them[,
to civilize them,]{.underline} to make of them good liberals[. Things
have changed. With a single-power global hegemony that is guided by a
universalist ideology, all relations have become, or threaten to become,
domestic]{.underline}. The inner/outer distinction has been transformed
into a morally and legally determined acceptable/unacceptable one, and
the power exists (or is thought to exist), both spiritually and
physically, to eliminate the unacceptable once and for all and make
believers of everyone. [The new imperative states: the other shall be
included. Delivered as a promise, it can only be received, by some, as
an ominous threat]{.underline}. In his The Conquest of America, Tzvetan
Todorov approaches our relationship to the \"other\" by way of three
interlocking distinctions, namely, self/other, same/different, and
equal/unequal. A simple superposition of all three distinctions makes of
the other someone who is different and therefore unequal. [The
problem]{.underline} we have been discussing, however, [comes to light
when we make of the other someone who is equal because ~~he~~ is
essentially the same. This form of the universalist ideology is
assimilationist.]{.underline} It denies the other by embracing ~~him~~.
Of the famous sixteenth-century defender of the Indians, Bartolomé de
Las Casas, Todorov writes, \[his\] declaration of the equality of men is
made in the name of a specific religion, Christianity\.... Hence, there
is a potential danger of seeing not only the Indians\' human nature
asserted but also their Christian \"nature.\" \"The natural laws and
rules and rights of men,\" Las Casas said; but who decides what is
natural with regard to laws and rights? Is it not specifically the
Christian religion? Since Christianity is universalist, it implies an
essential non-difference on the part of all men. We see the danger of
the identiWcation in this text of Saint John Chrysostrom, quoted and
defended at Valladolid: \"Just as there is no natural difference in the
creation of man, so there is no difference in the call to salvation of
all men, barbarous or wise, since God\'s grace can correct the minds of
barbarians, so that they have a reasonable understanding.\" Once again
we see that the term \"human\" is not descriptive, but evaluative. To be
truly human, one needs to be corrected. Regarding the relationship of
difference and equality, Todorov concludes, \"If it is \[End Page 139\]
incontestable that the prejudice of superiority is an obstacle in the
road to knowledge, we must also admit that the prejudice of equality is
a still greater one, for it consists in identifying the other purely and
simply with one\'s own \'ego ideal\' (or with oneself)\" (1984, 165).
[Such identification is]{.underline} not only [the essence]{.underline}
of Christianity, but also [of the doctrine of human rights]{.underline}
preached by enthusiasts like Habermas and Rawls. [And such
identification means that the other is stripped of his otherness and
made to conform to the universal ideal of what it means to be human. And
yet, despite---indeed, because of---the all-encompassing embrace, the
detested other is never allowed to leave the stage altogether. Even as
we seem on the verge of actualizing]{.underline} Kant\'s dream, as
Habermas puts it, [of \"a cosmopolitan order\" that unites all
peoples]{.underline} and abolishes war under the auspices of \"the
states of the First World\" who \"can afford to harmonize their national
interests to a certain extent with the norms that define the halfhearted
cosmopolitan aspirations of the UN\" (1998, 165, 184), it is still
fascinating to see how the barbarians make their functionally necessary
presence felt. John Rawls, in his The Law of Peoples (1999),
conveniently divides the world into well-ordered peoples and those who
are not well ordered. Among the former are the \"reasonable liberal
peoples\" and the \"decent hierarchical peoples\" (4). Opposed to them
are the \"outlaw states\" and other \"burdened\" peoples who are not
worthy of respect. [Liberal peoples,]{.underline} who, by virtue of
their history, possess superior institutions, culture, and moral
character (23-25)[, have not only the right to deny non-well-ordered
peoples respect, but the duty to extend what]{.underline} Vitoria called
\"brotherly correction\" and [Habermas \[called\] \"gentle
compulsion\"]{.underline} (Habermas 1997, 133). [That is, Rawls believes
that the \"refusal to tolerate\" those states deemed to be outlaw states
\"is a consequence of liberalism and decency.\" Why? Because outlaw
states violate human rights]{.underline}. What are human rights? \"What
I call human rights,\" Rawls states, \"are \... a proper subset of the
rights possessed by citizens in a liberal constitutional democratic
regime, or of the rights of the members of a decent hierarchical
society\" (Rawls 1999, 81). [Because of their violation of these liberal
rights, nonliberal, nondecent societies do not even have the right \"to
protest their condemnation by the world society\" (38), and decent
peoples have the right, if necessary, to wage just wars against
them]{.underline}. Thus, liberal societies are not merely contingently
established and historically conditioned forms of organization; they
become the universal standard against which other societies are judged.
[Those found wanting are banished,]{.underline} as outlaws[, from the
civilized world.]{.underline} Ironically, one of the signs of their
outlaw status is their insistence on autonomy, on sovereignty.

**Those who refuse the offer of political salvation are labeled as
subhuman because they have not converted to the High Church of humanism.
In this frame, war on difference becomes inevitable.**

**Rasch, 03** (Cultural Critique 54 (2003) 120-147, [William
Rasch](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#top)
is the Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana
University, Human Rights as Geopolitics  Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form
of American Supremacy).

As Schmitt says: [Only with the concept of the human in the sense of
absolute humanity does there appear as the other side of this concept
a]{.underline} specically [new enemy, the inhuman.]{.underline} In the
history of the nineteenth century, setting off the inhuman from the
human is followed by an even deeper split, the one between the
superhuman and the subhuman. In the same way that the human creates the
inhuman, so in the history of humanity the superhuman brings about with
a dialectical necessity the subhuman as its enemy twin. This \"two-sided
aspect of the ideal of humanity\" (Schmitt 1988, Der Nomos der Erde, 72)
is a theme Schmitt had already developed in his The Concept of the
Political (1976) and his critiques of liberal pluralism (e.g., 1988,
Positionen und Begriffe, 151-65). His complaint there is that [liberal
pluralism is in fact not in the least pluralist but reveals itself to be
an overriding monism,]{.underline} the monism of humanity. Thus[,
despite the claims that pluralism allows for the individual\'s
freedom]{.underline} from illegitimate constraint, Schmitt presses the
point home that [political opposition to liberalism is itself deemed
illegitimate. Indeed, liberal pluralism,]{.underline} in Schmitt\'s
eyes[, reduces the political to the social and economic and thereby
nullifies all truly political opposition by simply excommunicating its
opponents from the High Church of Humanity. After all, only an
unregenerate barbarian could fail to recognize the irrefutable benefits
of the liberal order.]{.underline} Though he favorably opposes
sixteenth-century Christianity to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment,
Schmitt has no interest in reestablishing the hegemony of the Roman
Church. Rather, he is in search of conceptual weapons with which to
fight the contemporary enemy. But it is a failed search just as it is a
failed contrast; for in Christianity, Schmitt finds not the other of
humanism, but humanism\'s roots. In truth, what Schmitt calls humanism
is but an intensification of the aspirations of the Roman Church. Unlike
the Judaism from which it sprang, Christianity is not a tribal or
national religion, but a religion of universal pretensions. The
distinction between believer and nonbeliever is not a distinction
between tribe and tribe or nation and nation; it is not a distinction
between neighbor and foreigner or even one between finite and
localizable friends and enemies. Rather, ideally, in the Christian
world, the negative pole of the distinction is to be fully and finally
consumed without remainder. The differences between families, tribes,
nations, friends, and enemies are meant to disappear. In the final
analysis [there is no room for opposition,]{.underline} neither within
the City of God nor against it, [and the polis]{.underline}---call it
Rome, call it Jerusalem---[will encompass the entire world]{.underline}.
That is precisely the purpose of its civilizing power. What Schmitt
calls humanism is but a more complete universalization of the same
dynamic. Christianity and humanism are both civilizing missions. In
neither case can there be barbarians left outside the gates because
eventually there will be no outside of the gates and, thus, no more
gates. [To live in the city, the barbarians must thoroughly give up
their barbarian ways---their customs, their religion, their language. In
the discourse that equates the polis with humanity, to remain a
barbarian is not to remain outside the city, but to be included in the
city as a moral and legal outlaw and thus to come under the city\'s
moral and legal jurisdiction]{.underline}. That liberal America\'s
civilizing mission is an extension of Christian Europe\'s was clearly
seen and approved of by James Brown Scott who during his life
(1866-1943) had been professor of international law and foreign
relations at Georgetown; both director and secretary of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace; president of three American and
European societies of international law; editor and interpreter of
Vitoria, Suarez, and Grotius; active propagandist for the Allied cause
during and after World War I; and loyal servant to President Woodrow
Wilson. Scott recognized the link between the conquest of the New World
and the splintering of the old. The \"discovery of America,\" he wrote
in a volume devoted to Vitoria and Suarez, \"gave birth to a modern law
of nations, Spanish in origin, lay in form, but Catholic in fact and
capable of continued development under the control of that Christian
morality of which all peoples, and \[End Page 137\] therefore all
nations, are beneficiaries\" (Spanish Conception of International Law,
1934, 2). This birth of a new law out of the spirit of Christianity
coincides with that religion\'s fragmentation, \"broken by the
Reformation,\" as Scott puts it, and \"replaced by an international
community, today \[1934\] universal and embracing all peoples of all
continents; the law applicable to members of the Christian community was
found to be applicable to non-Christians; and the law of nations, once
confined to Christendom, has become international. Without ceasing to be
Christian in fact, the law of nations became laicized in form\" (Spanish
Origin of International Law, 1934, 1-2). In this way, Christianity
survives its own secularization and the Greco-Christian West rises from
its ashes, rechristened simply as the entire world. The \"international
community,\" Scott writes, \"is coextensive with humanity---no longer
merely with Christianity;\" it has become \"the representative of the
common humanity rather than of the common religion binding the States.\"
Therefore, [the international community \"possesses the inherent right
to impose its will \... and to punish its violation, not because of a
treaty, or a pact or a covenant, but because of an international need\"
(283).]{.underline} If in the sixteenth century it was the Christian
Church that determined the content of this international need, in the
twentieth century and beyond it must be the secularized \"church\" of
\"common humanity\" that performs this all-important service.
\"Vitoria\'s idea,\" Scott reminds us, \"was to treat the Indians as
brothers and as equals, to help them in their worldly affairs, to
instruct them in spiritual matters and lead them to the altar by the
persuasion of Christian life on the part of the missionary\" (Spanish
Conception of International Law, 1934, 2). [Thus, with the
secularization of the Christian mission comes also the secularization of
the Christian missionary, who still shows his brotherly love by exerting
brotherly correction]{.underline}.

**Global liberal governance posits emergencies as in need of linear
policy solutions. The word is hardly that simple---there is a nonlinear
economy of power and knowledge and dramatic material inequalities. The
result of their over-simplification is serial policy failure.**

**Dillon & Reid, 2000** (Michael and Julian, Lecturer at the University
of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of
London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Humane Governance, Vol.
25 Ish. 1, January-March).

[Serial policy failure is no simple shortcoming that]{.underline}
science and policy\--and [policy science\--will ultimately overcome.
Serial policy failure is rooted in the]{.underline} ontological and
epistemological assumptions [that fashion the ways in which global
governance encounters and problematizes life as a process of emergence
through fitness landscapes]{.underline} that constantly adaptive and
changing ensembles have continuously to negotiate. [As a particular kind
of intervention into life, global governance promotes the very changes
and unintended outcomes that it then serially reproblematizes in terms
of policy failure. Thus, global liberal governance is not a linear
problem-solving process committed to the resolution of objective policy
problems simply by bringing better information and knowledge to bear
upon them. A nonlinear economy of power/knowledge, it deliberately
installs socially specific and radically inequitable distributions of
wealth, opportunity, and mortal danger]{.underline} both locally and
globally through the very detailed ways in which life is variously
(policy) problematized by it. [In consequence, thinking and acting
politically is displaced by the institutional]{.underline} and epistemic
[rivalries that infuse its power/ knowledge networks,]{.underline} and
by the local conditions of application that govern the introduction of
their policies. These now threaten to exhaust what \"politics,\" locally
as well as globally, is about. It is here that the \"emergence\"
characteristic of governance begins to make its appearance. [For it is
increasingly recognized that there are no definitive policy solutions to
objective, neat, discrete policy problems. The \"subjects\" of policy
increasingly also become a matter of definition as well, since the
concept population does not have a stable referent either]{.underline}
and has itself also evolved in biophilosophical and biomolecular as well
as Foucauldian \"biopower\" ways.

**Disorder and insecurity are inevitable because we live in a dangerous
world. Efforts to control this fear have resulted in the deaths of
millions and the creation of WMDs. The alternative is a negative gesture
of indifference---we must learn to live with the world as it is.
Admitting that everything is dangerous will allow us to break out of the
death cycle.**

**Der Derian, (Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts)
98** (James, On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes,
Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security).

[No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical
punch, nor commands the disciplinary power of \"security.\" In its name,
peoples have alienated their fears, rights and powers to gods, emperors,
and most recently, sovereign states, all to protect
themselves]{.underline} from the vicissitudes of nature\--as well as
from other gods, emperors, and sovereign states. [In its name, weapons
of mass destruction have been developed which have transfigured national
interest into a security dilemma based on a suicide pact.]{.underline}
And, less often noted in international relations, [in its name billions
have been made and millions killed while scientific knowledge has been
furthered and intellectual dissent muted.]{.underline} We have inherited
an *ontotheology* of security, that is, an *a priori* argument that
proves the existence and necessity of only one form of security because
there currently happens to be a widespread, metaphysical belief in it.
Indeed, within the concept of security lurks the entire history of
western metaphysics, which was best described by Derrida \"as a series
of substitutions of center for center\" in a perpetual search for the
\"transcendental signified.\"
^[1](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note1)^ From
God to Rational Man, from Empire to Republic, from King to the
People\--and on occasion in the reverse direction as well, for history
is never so linear, never so neat as we would write it\--the security of
the center has been the shifting site from which the forces of
authority, order, and identity philosophically defined and physically
kept at bay anarchy, chaos, and difference. Yet the center, as modern
poets and postmodern critics tell us, no longer holds. The demise of a
bipolar system, the diffusion of power into new political, national, and
economic constellations, the decline of civil society and the rise of
the shopping mall, the acceleration of *everything* \--transportation,
capital and information flows, change itself\--have induced a new
anxiety. As George Bush repeatedly said\--that is, until the 1992
Presidential election went into full swing\--\"The enemy is
unpredictability. The enemy is instability.\"
^[2](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note2)^ One
immediate response, the unthinking reaction, is to master this anxiety
and to resecure the center by remapping the peripheral threats. In this
vein, the Pentagon prepares seven military scenarios for future
conflict, ranging from *latino* small-fry to an IdentiKit super-enemy
that goes by the generic acronym of REGT (\"Reemergent Global Threat\").
In the heartlands of America, Toyota sledge-hammering returns as a
popular know-nothing distraction. And within the Washington beltway,
rogue powers such as North Korea, Iraq, and Libya take on the status of
pariah-state and potential video bomb-site for a permanently
electioneering elite. There are also prodromal efforts to shore up the
center of the International Relations discipline. In a newly instituted
series in the *International Studies Quarterly* , the state of security
studies is surveyed so as to refortify its borders.
^[3](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note3)^
After acknowledging that \"the boundaries of intellectual disciplines
are permeable,\" the author proceeds not only to raise the drawbridge
but also to caulk every chink in the moat.
^[4](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note4)^
Recent attempts to broaden the concept of \"security\" to include such
issues as global environmental dangers, disease, and economic and
natural disasters endanger the field by threatening \"to destroy its
intellectual coherence and make it more difficult to devise solutions to
any of these important problems.\"
^[5](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note5)^ The
field is surveyed in the most narrow and parochial way: out of 200-plus
works cited, esteemed Third World scholars of strategic studies receive
no mention, British and French scholars receive short shrift, and Soviet
writers do not make it into the Pantheon at all. The author of the
essay, Stephen Walt, has written one of the better books on alliance
systems;
^[6](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note6)^ here
he seems intent on constructing a new alliance within the discipline
against \"foreign\" others, with the \"postmodernist\" as arch-alien.
The tactic is familiar: like many of the neoconservatives who have
launched the recent attacks on \"political correctness,\" the
\"liberals\" of international relations make it a habit to base their
criticisms on secondary accounts of a category of thinking rather than
on a primary engagement with the specific (and often differing) views of
the thinkers themselves.
^[7](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note7)^ In
this case, Walt cites IR scholar Robert Keohane on the hazards of
\"reflectivism,\" to warn off anyone who by inclination or error might
wander into the foreign camp: \"As Robert Keohane has noted, until these
writers \`have delineated . . . a research program and shown . . . that
it can illuminate important issues in world politics, they will remain
on the margins of the field.\' \"
[8](http://libcat1.cc.emory.edu:32888/20050307122932441313c0=www.ciaonet.org:80/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note8)
By the end of the essay, one is left with the suspicion that the rapid
changes in world politics have triggered a \"security crisis\" in
security studies that requires extensive theoretical damage control.
[What if we leave the desire for mastery to the insecure and instead
imagine a new dialogue of security, not in the pursuit of a utopian end
but in recognition of the world as it is, *other than us* ]{.underline}?
What might such a dialogue sound like? Any attempt at an answer requires
a genealogy: to understand the discursive power of the concept, to
remember its forgotten meanings, to assess its economy of use in the
present, to reinterpret\--and possibly construct through the
reinterpretation\--a late modern security comfortable with a plurality
of centers, multiple meanings, and fluid identities. The steps I take
here in this direction are tentative and preliminary. I first undertake
a brief history of the concept itself. Second, I present the
\"originary\" form of security that has so dominated our conception of
international relations, the Hobbesian episteme of realism. Third, I
consider the impact of two major challenges to the Hobbesian episteme,
that of Marx and Nietzsche. And finally, I suggest that Baudrillard
provides the best, if most nullifying, analysis of security in late
modernity. In short, I retell the story of realism as an historic
encounter of fear and danger with power and order that produced four
realist forms of security: epistemic, social, interpretive, and
hyperreal. To preempt a predictable criticism, I wish to make it clear
that [I am not in search of an \"alternative security.\"]{.underline} An
easy defense is to invoke Heidegger, who declared that \"questioning is
the piety of thought.\" Foucault, however, gives the more powerful
reason for a genealogy of security: I am not looking for an alternative;
you can\'t find the solution of a problem in the solution of another
problem raised at another moment by other people. You see, [what I want
to do is not the history of solutions, and that\'s the reason why I
don\'t accept the word *alternative* . My point is not that everything
is bad, but that everything is dangerous,]{.underline} then we always
have something to do. The hope is that [in the interpretation
of]{.underline} the most pressing [dangers]{.underline} of late
modernity [we might be able to construct a form of security based on the
appreciation]{.underline} and articulation [rather than the]{.underline}
normalization or [extirpation of difference. Nietzsche
transvalues]{.underline} both Hobbes\'s and Marx\'s [interpretations of
security through a genealogy of modes of being. His method
is]{.underline} not to uncover some deep meaning or value for security,
but [to destabilize the intolerable fictional identities of the past
which have been created out of fear, and to affirm the creative
differences which might yield new values for the future]{.underline}.
Originating in the paradoxical relationship of a contingent life and a
certain death, the history of security reads for Nietzsche as an
abnegation, a resentment and, finally, a transcendence of this paradox.
In brief, [the history is one of individuals seeking an impossible
security from the most radical \"other\" of life, the terror of death
which, once generalized and nationalized, triggers a futile cycle of
collective identities seeking security from alien others\--who are

**In the face of a crisis of suffering, we are presented with two
options:**

**1) the world of the 1AC---a life-denying will to calculate the
greatest good and manage the herd---dooming us to mediocrity and hatred
for the world. Or,**

**2) the alternative---we can accept that chaos and discord are
inevitable, that preventing suffering is impossible, and escape nihilism
by affirming life as it is.**

**Owen and Ridley, 2000** (David Owen is Reader in Political Philosophy
and Deputy Director of the Centre for Post-Analytic Philosophy at the
University of Southampton. He is the author of numerous books and
articles in social and political philosophy with a focus on Nietzsche.
Aaron Ridley is a professor of Philosophy at the School of Humanities at
the University of Southampton. He has also written multiple books about
Nietzschean ethics. Why Nietzsche still? page 149-54)

The threat here is obvious: What is to be feared, what has a more
calamitous effect than any other calamity, is that man should inspire
not profound fear but profound *nausea;* also not great fear but great
*pity.* Suppose these two were one day to unite, they would inevitably
beget one of the uncanniest monsters: the \"last will\" of man, his will
to nothingness, nihilism. And a great deal points to this union. *(GM*
III:I4) So suicidal nihilism beckons. The one response to the situation
that is absolutely ruled out is the one that has so far proved most
successful at addressing problems of this sort, namely, adoption of the
ascetic ideal, because the present crisis is caused by the
self-destruction of that ideal. But [Nietzsche argues that two plausible
responses to the crisis are]{.underline} nonetheless
[possible]{.underline} for modern man. Both of these involve the
construction of immanent ideals or goals: one response is represented by
the type the Last Man, the other by the type the *Ubermensch.* [The
first response recognizes the reality of suffering and]{.underline} our
(post-ascetic) inability to accord transcendental significance to it and
[concludes that the latter provides an overwhelming reason for
abolishing the former to whatever extent is possible.]{.underline} This
has the effect of elevating the abolition of suffering into a
quasi-transcendental goal and brings with it a new table of virtues, on
which prudence figures largest. In other words, [this response takes the
form of]{.underline} a *rapport a soi* characterized by a style of
**[calculative rationality directed toward the avoidance of suffering at
any cost]{.underline}**, for example, [**of utilititarianism and any
other account of human subjectivity that accords preeminence to
maximizing preference satisfaction**.]{.underline} In *Thus Spoke
Zarathustra* Nietzsche portrays this type as follows: \"What is love?
What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\" thus asks the Last
Man and blinks. [The earth has become small, and upon it hops the Last
Man, who makes everything small. His race is as inexterminable as the
flea; the Last Man lives longest. \"]{.underline}We have discovered
happiness,\" say the Last Men and blink. They have left the places where
living was hard: for one needs warmth. One still loves one\'s neighbor
and rubs oneself against him: for one needs warmth. Sickness and
mistrust count as sins with them: one should go about warily. He is a
fool who still stumbles over stones or over men! A little poison now and
then: that produces pleasant dreams. And a lot of poison at last, for a
pleasant death. They still work, for work is entertainment. But they
take care the entertainment does not exhaust them. Nobody grows rich or
poor any more: both are too much of a burden. Who still wants to rule?
Who obey? Both are too much of a burden. No herdsman and one herd.
[Everyone wants the same thing, everyone is the same: whoever thinks
otherwise goes voluntarily into the madhouse]{.underline} \"Formerly all
the world was mad,\" say the most acute of them and blink. They are
clever and know everything that has ever happened: so there is no end to
their mockery. They still quarrel, but they soon make up-otherwise
indigestion would result. They have their little pleasure for the day
and their little pleasure for the night: but they respect health. \"We
have discovered happiness,\" say the Last Men and blink. *(Z:* I
\"Prologue\" 5) [Nietzsche\'s]{.underline} hostility to this first form
of response is evident. His [general objection to the Last Man is that
the Last Man\'s ideal]{.underline}, like the ascetic ideal, [is
committed to the denial of chance and necessity as integral features of
human existence.]{.underline} Whereas the ascetic ideal denies chance
and necessity per se so that, while suffering remains real, what is
objectionable about it is abolished, [the Last Man\'s ideal is expressed
as the practical imperative to abolish suffering]{.underline}, and
hence, a fortiori, what is objectionable about it -- that is, our
exposure to chance and necessity. This general objection has two
specific dimensions. The first is that [**the Last Man\'s ideal is
unrealizable**, insofar as human existence involves ineliminable sources
of suffering-]{.underline}not least our consciousness that we come into
being by chance and cease to be by necessity. Thus the Last Man\'s ideal
is predicated on a neglect of truthfulness. The second dimension of
Nietzsche\'s objection is that **[pursuit of the Last Man\'s ideal
impoverishes and arbitrarily restricts our understanding of what we can
be and]{.underline}**, in doing so, [**forecloses our future
possibilities of becoming otherwise than we are**.]{.underline} Thus the
Last Man\'s ideal entails an atrophying of the capacities (for
self-overcoming, etc.) bequeathed by the ascetic ideal. Nietzsche brings
these two dimensions together in *Beyond Good and Evil:* \"You want, if
possible -- and there is no more insane \'if possible\' -- to *abolish
suffering.* \... Well-being as you understand it -- that is no goal,
that seems to us an *end,* a state that soon makes man ridiculous and
contemptible -- that makes his destruction *desirable\" (BGE 225).* [The
second response]{.underline} to the nihilistic threat posed by the
selfdestruction of the ascetic ideal is definitive of the *Ubermensch*
type. This response [**recognizes both the reality and the
ineliminability of suffering and concludes that an affirmation of chance
and necessity must therefore be built into the very conception of what
it is for something to function** as a (postascetic) ideal]{.underline}.
So [this response]{.underline}, insofar as it cultivates [an affirmation
of chance and necessity]{.underline} (i.e., *amor fati),* [overcomes
the]{.underline} (ascetic) [hatred of or]{.underline} (modern)
[dissatisfaction with this-worldly existence]{.underline}. Yet the
success of this overcoming is conditional on the exercise and
development of the very capacities and disposition that are the bequest
of the ascetic ideal. The disposition to truthfulness is a condition of
recognizing the ineliminability of chance and necessity. But actually to
recognize, let alone affirm, this awful fact about human existence
requires the exercise of the capacities for self-surveillance (so that
one can monitor oneself for the symptoms of self-deception in the face
of this fact), self-discipline (so that one can resist the
understandable temptation to deceive oneself about this fact), and
self-overcoming (so that one can develop, in the face of this
temptation, one\'s capacities for self-surveillance and
self-discipline). Thus the ascetic ideal provides the tools required to
overcome the crisis precipitated by its own self-destruction. In other
words, the *Ubermensch\'s* ideal simply is the exercise and cultivation
of the capacities and the disposition required to affirm the fact that
chance and necessity are ineliminable. And because chance and necessity
are ineliminable, and therefore require perpetually to be affirmed anew,
[such exercise and cultivation must itself be perpetual, a process
without the slightest prospect of an end.]{.underline}

OWEN & RIDLEY CONTINUE...

[The contrast with the Last Man\'s ideal is stark. Whereas the latter
offers a feeling of power to its devotees by positing as realizable the
unrealizable ideal of no more suffering-that is, of a fixed, final,
*completed* state of being -- the *Ubermensch's* ideal offers a feeling
of power predicated only on the continual overcoming of the desire for
any such state.]{.underline} What the Last Man longs for, in other
words., the *Ubermensch* distinguishes himself by unendingly and
truthfully refusing to want. It is of the first importance that **[the
*Ubermensch\'s* ideal should represent a *process* as inherently
valuable, rather than a product (such as the Last Man\'s completed state
of life without suffering]{.underline}**). There are two reasons for
thinking this important. The first is the one mentioned above given that
chance and necessity are ineliminable features of living a life, [a life
oriented to the affirmation of this fact must recognize the ineliminably
processual character of such an affirmation, and hence the ineliminably
processual character of an ideal that serves rather than denies \"the
most fundamental prerequisites of life]{.underline}\" *(GM* III:28). The
other reason is that this ideal exhibits the form of practical reasoning
that Nietzsche\'s genealogy itself deploys. By contrast with, say,
Kant\'s conception of practical reasoning, which centers on an
opposition between the real and the ideal (between the heteronomous and
the autonomous), and denies \"the most fundamental prerequisites of
life,\" Nietzsche\'s conception involves a continual process of movement
from the attained to the attainable; and it is precisely this that the
*rapport a soi* constitutive of the *Ubermensch* exhibits. Thus, while
Kant offers a juridical conception of practical reasoning structured in
terms of the idea of *law,* Nietzsche offers a medical or therapeutic
conception articulated through the idea of the type or exemplar. Which
is to say, Nietzsche\'s genealogical investigation (at its best, i.e.,
its most self-consistent) exemplifies precisely that commitment to the
affirmation of life which it recommends, that is, to an *Ubermenschlich
rapport a soi.* Process, not product; Dionysus, not Apollo.

**Social services are the embodiment of the ascetic ideal of that Last
Man---they create an underclass that is increasingly vulnerable to
statist coercion.**

**Arnold 05** (Kathleen, Assistant Professor of political and feminist
theory @ U. of Texas, San Antonio, "Asceticism in Contemporary Political
Theory: Marx, Weber, Nietzsche and Beyond," Theory & Event, ProjectMUSE)

In conclusion, [the prescription of asceticism]{.underline} while
intended for the entire populace, [has been aimed at the working poor
and welfare recipients as the exemplar of a group that is simultaneously
being molded into good, docile citizens while being punished for
\"excesses.\"]{.underline} Despite the gap between rich and poor,
employment opportunities for women, sexism, racism and the crisis in
affordable housing, these groups are blamed for their poverty. [The
ascetic values underlying policy and cultural solutions imply that the
poor will achieve some sort of self-mastery and thus, fitness for
citizenship, if they only buckle down.]{.underline} Nevertheless, this
espousal of asceticism is an attempt to master groups falling under the
rubric of the biological through eradicating or neutralizing difference
and the power relation is one of coercion more than independence or
self-will. In this way, [the dynamics of power in the liberal capitalist
state have allowed for the coexistence of seemingly contradictory power
mechanisms, both democratic and non-democratic. However, this seemingly
paradoxical coexistence is an integral part of liberal capitalism:
\"bare life\" is crucial to political identity, power and the economy
and elucidates the deployment of prerogative power in the domestic
arena]{.underline}. This (partial) intellectual history of ascetic ideas
thus suggests how and why [the moral imperatives of welfare and the
ascetic practices]{.underline} linked to workfare and work in the global
economy [do not signal the decreasing importance of the
state]{.underline}, much less sovereignty, in late modern politics. The
purported disappearance of the nation-state has been claimed on two
fronts: in the context of the global economy first, and second, in the
dismantling of welfare and affirmative action programs. However, these
developments do not demonstrate the absence of state [but rather, the
increasing influence of economic logic in matters of
sovereignty]{.underline}, both internal and
external.[^129^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v008/8.2arnold.html#_edn129)
Ascetic ideas provide the crucial nexus between the deployment of
prerogative, on the one hand, and the dictates of capitalism, on the
other. [The increasing predominance of a capitalist and ascetic ethos
thus brings politics to the level of bare life and facilitates the
greater influence of bio-power and disciplinary power,]{.underline} thus
enabling the suspension of law.

# link: hegemony

**The affirmative's search for security is rooted in fear---the quest to
control difference creates enemies, recycling the need for security.**

**Der Derian,** **98** - Director of Watson Institute Global Security
program -- 1998 (James, former Rhodes Scholar, [On
Security]{.underline}, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche,
and Baudrillard," ed. Ronnie Lipschutz. ciaonet)

[Nietzsche transvalues]{.underline} both Hobbes\'s and Marx\'s
interpretations of [security]{.underline} through a genealogy of modes
of being. [His method is]{.underline} not to uncover some deep meaning
or value for security, but [to destabilize the intolerable fictional
identities of the past which have been created out of fear, and to
affirm the creative differences]{.underline} which might yield new
values for the future.
[33](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note33)
Originating in the paradoxical relationship of a contingent life and a
certain death, [the history of security reads for Nietzsche as an
abnegation, a resentment]{.underline} and, finally, a transcendence of
this paradox. In brief[, the history is one of individuals seeking an
impossible security from the most radical \"other\" of life, the terror
of death which,]{.underline} once generalized and nationalized[,
triggers a futile cycle of collective identities seeking security from
alien others\--who are seeking similarly impossible
guarantees.]{.underline} It is a story of differences taking on the
otherness of death, and identities calcifying into a fearful sameness.
Since Nietzsche has suffered the greatest neglect in international
theory, his reinterpretation of security will receive a more extensive
treatment here. One must begin with Nietzsche\'s idea of the will to
power, which he clearly believed to be prior to and generative of all
considerations of security. In Beyond Good and Evil , he emphatically
establishes the primacy of the will to power: \"Physiologists should
think before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the
cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to
discharge  its strength\--life itself is will to power;
self-preservation is only one of the most frequent results.\"
[34](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note34) The
will to power, then, should not be confused with a Hobbesian perpetual
desire  for power. It can, in its negative form, produce a reactive and
resentful longing for only  power, leading, in Nietzsche\'s view, to a
triumph of nihilism. But Nietzsche refers to a positive will to power,
an active and affective force of becoming, from which values and
meanings\--including self-preservation\--are produced which affirm life.
[Conventions of security act to suppress rather than confront the fears
endemic to life,]{.underline} for \". . . life itself is essentially 
appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker;
suppression, hardness, imposition of one\'s own forms, incorporation and
at least, at its mildest, exploitation\--but why should one always use
those words in which slanderous intent has been imprinted for ages.\"
[35](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note35)
Elsewhere [Nietzsche establishes the pervasiveness of agonism in life:
\"life is a consequence of war, society itself a means to
war.\"]{.underline}
[36](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note36) But
[the denial of this permanent condition,]{.underline} the effort to
disguise it with a consensual rationality or to hide from it with a
fictional sovereignty[, are all effects of this suppression of fear. The
desire for security is manifested as a collective resentment of
difference\--that which is not us, not certain, not
predictable.]{.underline} Complicit with a negative will to power is the
fear-driven desire for protection from the unknown. Unlike the positive
will to power, which produces an aesthetic affirmation of difference,
the search for truth produces a truncated life which conforms to the
rationally knowable, to the causally sustainable. In The Gay Science ,
Nietzsche asks of the reader: \"Look, isn\'t our need for knowledge
precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover everything
strange, unusual, and questionable, something that no longer disturbs
us? Is it not the instinct of fear  that bids us to know? And is the
jubilation of those who obtain knowledge not the jubilation over the
restoration of a sense of security?\"
[37](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note37) [The
fear of the unknown and the desire for certainty combine to produce a
domesticated life, in which causality and rationality become the highest
sign of a sovereign self, the surest protection against contingent
forces. The fear of fate assures a belief that everything reasonable is
true, and everything true, reasonable.]{.underline} In short[, the
security imperative produces, and is sustained by, the strategies of
knowledge which seek to explain it. Nietzsche elucidates]{.underline}
the nature of this generative relationship in The Twilight of the
Idols : The causal instinct is thus conditional upon, and excited by,
the feeling of fear. The \"why?\" shall, if at all possible, not give
the cause for its own sake so much as for a particular kind of
cause \--a cause that is comforting, liberating and relieving. . . .
[That which is new and strange and has not been experienced before, is
excluded as a cause.]{.underline} Thus one not only searches for some
kind of explanation, to serve as a cause, but for a particularly
selected and preferred kind of explanation\--that which most quickly and
frequently abolished the feeling of the strange, new and hitherto
unexperienced: the most habitual  explanations.
[38](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note38) A
safe life requires safe truths. [The strange]{.underline} and the alien
[remain unexamined, the unknown becomes identified as evil, and evil
provokes hostility\--recycling the desire for security.]{.underline}

has taken on the impossible task of re-making the world in our image.

[A war to rid the world of evil, and ending it on the hour, even one so
chosen by the most powerful nation in the world, is yet another tall
order set by the *NSS*. The war is to be fought simultaneously on
multiple fronts, aiming, when possible, \"to disrupt the financing of
terrorism\" and \"to enlist the support of the international
community,\" and, when necessary, to \"not hesitate to act
alone]{.underline} . . . to exercise our right of self-defense by acting
preemptively\" (6). [The strategy for defense might start, but it does
not stop, at our border. States that support terrorism will be compelled
\"to accept their sovereign responsibilities\"; \"terrorism will be
viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide]{.underline}\";
and public diplomacy will be used \"to promote the free flow of
information and ideas\" (6). And should the ghost of Vince Lombardi
prove insufficient (\"While we recognize that our best defense is a good
offense . . .) , then the war must be waged at home as well (\". . . we
are also strengthening America\'s homeland security to protect against
and deter attack\" \[6\]). In most of the sections that follow, after
all the early fist waving at terrorism and its supporters, the hand of
the United States is opened to the international community that must be
constituted by a conflict in which \"freedom and fear are at war,\" and
\"there will be no quick or easy end\" (7). In these sections, the *NSS*
seeks to \"Work with Others to Defuse Regional Conflicts\" (section IV);
\"Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and
Free Trade\" (section VI); \"Expand the Circle of Development by Opening
Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy\" (Section VII);
and \"Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers
of Global Power\" (Section VIII). But the document seems schizoid: after
a prologue in which lines are drawn and ultimatums issued, the call for
international dialogue rings hollow. [The *NSS* might aim for peace, but
it amounts to a blueprint for a permanent war. Gone is any trace of the
humility that presidential candidate Bush invoked in his foreign policy
addresses. In its place, hubris of an epic size obviates any historical
or self-consciousness about the costs of empire. What ends not
predestined by America\'s righteousness are to be preempted by the
sanctity of holy war. The *NSS* leaves the world with two options: peace
on U.S. terms, or the perpetual peace of the grave.]{.underline}

**The war on terror is being framed as a holy war that justifies the use
of violence anywhere in the globe.**

[If 9-11 is not wholly new, what is it? We have a better sense of what
it is not than what it is: from the President and Secretary of Defense
and on down the food-chain of the national security hierarchy, we have
heard that this will not be a war of states against states]{.underline};
it will not be the Gulf War or Kosovo; and it will not be Vietnam or
Mogadishu. And they\'re probably right \-- certainly more right than
commentators from both the Right (it\'s Pearl Harbor) and Left (it\'s an
anti-imperialist struggle) who have relied on sloppy ideological
analogies to understand the event. In my view 9-11 is a combination of
new and old forms of conflict, including: the rhetoric of holy war from
both sides; a virtual network war in the media and on the internet; a
high-tech surveillance war overseas but also in our airports, our
cities, and even our homes; and a dirty war of counter-terrorism and
counter-insurgency, using an air campaign and limited special operations
to kill the leadership and to intimidate the supporters of al Qaeda and
the Taliban. [I call this new hybrid conflict, *virtuous
war*]{.underline}. It has evolved from the battlefield technologies of
the Gulf War and the aerial campaigns of Bosnia and Kosovo; [it draws on
just war doctrine (when possible) and holy war (when
necessary]{.underline}); it clones the infowar of global surveillance
and the networked war of multiple media. In the name of the holy trinity
of international order \-- global free markets, democratic sovereign
states, and limited humanitarian interventions \-- the U.S. has led the
way in a revolution in military affairs (RMA) which underlies virtuous
war. [At the heart as well as the muscle of this transformation is the
*technical capability* and *ethical imperative* to threaten and, if
necessary, actualize violence from a distance]{.underline} \-- but
again, with minimal casualties when possible. Using networked
information, global surveillance, and virtual technologies to bring
\'there\' here in near real-time and with near-verisimilitude, virtuous
war emerged before 9-11.

# link: war on terror

**The war on terror re-enforces two dangerous trends; first, it seeks to
control that which is inherently chaotic and uncontrollable, second, it
fuels imperial suspension of democracy at home and abroad.**

**Brown, 05** (*Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics*,
Wendy, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley).

[There are two powers in our times whose main currency is fear:
terrorism and empire. The principle of terrorism is unpredictable
violence; it is the opposite of systematic, visible, routine, or
regularized domination]{.underline}. What renders terrorist violence as
power is its inevitable, anticipated, yet random arrival, its capacity
to disrupt and destroy everyday life any time and any place. [Because
terrorism has no regular time or place, we are made fearful less by
actual terrorist events than by the specter of terrorism,]{.underline} a
specter that works through incalculability. This is the fundamental
absurdity of color-coded \"terror alerts.\" [Feigning an ability to
measure and predict the moves of a power form that mocks measurement and
prediction, the alerts pretend in a way that convinces no one that we
know what will happen next, that we are in control when we are not, even
as they no doubt increase the fearfulness of those imagining themselves
to be targets.]{.underline} The principle of fear at work in
contemporary practices of empire is quite different from that in
terrorism and is related to the modem illegitimacy of empire vis-a-vis
principles of democracy and popular sovereignty. This illegitimacy means
that [empire today can be justified only through fear, by declaring a
perpetual state of emergency that would allow conventional democratic
principles to be overridden]{.underline}. So modern empire mobilizes
human fear on a mass scale; it is above all parasitic on the fear
incited by the specter of terrorism, but it is also dependent on the
fear related to the porousness of modern nation states and to the
exposure of vulnerable individuals and deracinated communities to the
vicissitudes of global forces. [Empire promises protection from dangers
that it rhetorically magnifies in order to secure itself, a
magnification that intensifies our fear in the dark]{.underline}. But
while darkness today implies not only fear but also disorientation, the
latter pertains to an arc of powers shaping the present that exceed a
dialectic of empire and terror. We are disoriented by the literal loss
of trajectory following the collapse of historical metanarratives in a
present that appears fraught with injustice and misery and not only
apocalyptic danger. It has become a commonplace to describe our time as
pounded by undemocratic historical forces yet lacking a ***forward***
movement. This makes the weight of the present very heavy: all mass, no
velocity. Or, in the terms of the late modem speediness invoked earlier:
all speed, no direction. If this heaviness mixed with speediness were
analogized to a mental state, the diagnosis would be profound depressive
anxiety, a disorder for which an astonishing number of persons today
seek treatment. [Depressive anxiety is a terrible state]{.underline}:
you cannot move because of the bleakness but you cannot rest because of
the anxiety; you can neither seize life nor escape it, neither live nor
die[. There may not be a better appellation for our condition, for the
bleakness of a seemingly eternal present with catastrophe limning its
horizon. Permanent daylight, Nietzsche reminds us, is one with unbroken
darkness; the unbearability of both is time stopped, an endless
present.\'\' Unbroken time is the time of eternity, death\'s
time]{.underline}.

**The effort to control proliferation has turned into an absolute battle
between good and evil. It has become a blank check for unlimited war
designed to make the world fit our image of security.**

[From the perspective of the *NSS*]{.underline}, even before the shock
of 9/11, [the end of the Cold War augured not global peace but a new
world disorder. \"New deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states
and terrorists]{.underline}\" (13); and while they might not possess the
might of the Soviet Union, [they have the asymmetrical advantages
garnered by weapons of mass destruction and the will to use
them]{.underline}. [Positing that traditional deterrence no longer
works, the *NSS* presents axiomatically the right to preemptively strike
against these new enemies: \"The greater the threat, the greater is the
risk of inaction---and the more compelling the case for taking
anticipatory action to defend ourselves]{.underline}, even if
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\'s attack\"
(15). [This is not a grand strategy; this is a blank check, to take
whatever actions, whenever deemed necessary, against whoever fits the
terrorist profile]{.underline}. Facing \"an age where the enemies of
civilization openly and actively seek the world\'s most destructive
technologies,\" the *NSS* sanctions a counterstrategy based on superior
intelligence, ethics, and technological capability (15): \"The reasons
for our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just\"
(16). [In short, war will be *virtuous*]{.underline}. First auditioned
in the Balkans, and dress-rehearsed in Afghanistan, virtuous war took
center stage in the invasion of Iraq. Virtuous war projects a
technological and ethical superiority in which computer simulation,
media dissimulation, global surveillance, and networked warfare combine
to deter, discipline, and, if need be, destroy the enemy. Ethically
intentioned and virtually applied, drawing on the doctrines of just war
when possible and holy war when necessary, virtuous war is more than a
felicitous oxymoron. [After September 11, as the United States chose
coercion over diplomacy in its foreign policy, and deployed a rhetoric
of total victory over absolute evil, virtuous war became the ultimate
means]{.underline} by which the United States intended to resecure its
borders, assert its suzerainty, and secure the holy trinity of
international order: global capitalism (VI. Ignite a New Era of Global
Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade \[17\]); Western
models of democracy (VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening
Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy \[21\]); a
hegemonic \"balance of power\" (VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative
Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power \[25\]); and
preventive interventions.

**Cosmopolitanism fails. The liberal order will always require a
scapegoat to destroy in the name of expanding peace. Humanitarianism and

of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of

It is our contention, then, that the [liberal peace]{.underline} of
global governance has to be distinguished as a certain form of liberal
peace comprised in turn of a complex hybrid form of power. The varied
use of the term governance signals this. In its Kantian variants, it
[means the rule of law and endorses the proliferation of nongovernmental
organizations, associations, and groups at a global level with the
ambition of establishing a global civil society]{.underline}. In its
technocratic-capitalist variants, it means deregulated processes and
practices of enterprise management and accountability. [The liberal
peace of global governance is therefore one in which the pacifying
effects of Kantian cosmopolitan law obeyed by sovereign
states]{.underline}, combined with an extension of civil society, are
heavily reliant also on the dissemination globally of practices that are
premised upon a conception of order and management that Foucault called

and as the extension and application of it subsequently have also shown,
the genealogy of global liberal governance is thus much more varied and
diverse than its public claims to a Kantian heritage especially would
imply. To say that it is capitalist economically as much as it is
liberal politically and corporately technocratic scientifically, and
that this presents a powerful brew of social, political, economic, and
military forces that radically exceed the liberal account of both power
and of politics, is to pose more questions than these phrases answer.

**Cosmopolitan liberalism is not actually more open because it can only
be extended to others who have already accepted liberal principles.
States that resist the global order are treated as threats.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

[Liberal tolerance, which simultaneously affirms the value of autonomy
and consecrates state secularism, is understood as a virtue available
only to the self regulating individual, as a political principle
available only to secular states, and as a good appropriately extended
only to individuated subjects and regimes that promote such
individuation. Conversely, those captive to organicism and organicist
practices are presumed neither to value tolerance, to be capable of
tolerance, nor to be entitled to tolerance. The governmentality of
tolerance deploys the formal legal autonomy of the subject and the
formal secularism of the state as a threshold of the tolerable, marking
as intolerable whatever is regarded as a threat to such autonomy and
secularism]{.underline}. Yet even as tolerance is mobilized to manage
the challenges to this logic posed by the eruptions of subnational
identities in liberal polities occasioned by late modern transnational
population flows, its invocation also functions as a sign of the
breakdown of this logic of liberal universalism. Tolerance arises as a
way of negotiating "cultural," "ethnic," and "religious" differences
that clash with the hegemonic "societal culture" within which they
exist. The conflict that emerges when those differences emerge or erupt
into public life poses more than a policy problem- for example, whether
Muslim girls in France can wear the hijab to public schools, or whether
female circumcision or bigamy can be practiced in North America. Rather,
[the conflict itself exposes the nonuniversal character of liberal
legalism and public life: it exposes its cultural
dimensions]{.underline}. This expose is managed by tolerance discourse
in one of two ways. Either the difference is designated as dangerous in
its nonliberalism (hence not tolerable) or as merely religious, ethnic,
or cultural (hence not a candidate for a political claim). [If it is
nonliberal political difference, it is intolerable; and if it is
tolerated, it must be privatized, converted into an individually chosen
belief or practice with no political bearing. Tolerance thus functions
as the supplement to a liberal secularism]{.underline} that cannot
sustain itself at this moment.

Just as governance is a specific feature of liberalism, so also [liberal
peace is]{.underline} therefore [a specific form of liberal governmental
power.]{.underline} Hence the peace of global liberal governance differs
from other forms of liberal peace inasmuch as its liberalism differs
from earlier and other forms of liberalism in respect, specifically, of
the increasing emphasis placed on its networks of global governance[. It
does not, for example, aspire to the ideal of world government. It does
not rely exclusively upon the juridical power of international law.
Neither does it problematize the foundational question of order by
premising it exclusively on the sovereign power of states alone. It is
also a combative and heavily armed peace deeply reluctant to forgo its
own military advantages in the cause of restraining the dissemination of
weapons of mass destruction or the effective control of the
conventional-arms economy globally]{.underline}.

# link: cosmopolitanism

**Cosmopolitan peace is a myth---it enables the domination of all those
considered insufficiently liberal.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

[That tolerance is preferable to violent civil conflict is inarguable.
What this truism elides, however, is the discursive function of
tolerance in legitimating the often violent imperialism of international
liberal governmentality conjoined with neoliberal global political
economy. The practice of tolerance does not simply anoint the superior
or advanced status of the tolerant. Withholding tolerance for designated
practices, cultures and regimes does not simply mark them as beyond the
pale of civilization. The economy of this offering and this refusal also
masks the cultural norms of liberal democratic regimes and of the West
by denying their status as cultural norms]{.underline}. What becomes
clear when we consider together the above-named thinkers is that the
discourse of tolerance substantively brokers cultural value- valorizing
the West, othering the rest-while feigning to do no more than
distinguish civilization from barbarism, protect the former from the
latter, and extend the benefits of liberal thought and practices.
Insofar as tolerance in its civilizational mode draws on a
political-juridical discourse of cultural neutrality, in which what is
at stake is said to be rationality, individual autonomy, and the rule of
law rather than the (despotic) rule of culture or religion, tolerance is
crucial to liberalism\'s denial of its imbrication with culture and the
colonial projection of culture onto the native. It is crucial to
liberalism\'s conceit of independence from culture, of neutrality with
regard to culture . . . a conceit that in turn shields liberal polities
from charges of cultural supremacy and cultural imperialism. This was
precisely the conceit that allowed George W. Bush to declare, without
recourse to the infelicitous language of \"crusade,\" that \"we have no
intention of imposing our culture\" on others while insisting on a set
of liberal principles that others cannot brook without risking being
bombed (see chapter 6).

**Cosmopolitanism is the perfect excuse for colonial domination\-\--it
cloaks the culturally specific Western liberal subject as a universal
neutral.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

The native, the fanatic, the fundamentalist, and the bigot are what must
be overcome by the society committed to tolerance; from the perspective
of the tolerant, these figures are premodern or at least have not been
thoroughly bathed in modernity, a formulation endlessly rehearsed by
Thomas Friedman in his New York Times editorials on Islam. This reminds
us that it is not really Western civilization tout court but that
identifications of modernity and, in particular, liberalism with the
West- indeed, [the identification of liberalism as the telos of the
west- that provides the basis for Western civilizational
supremacy]{.underline}. What wraps in a common leaf the native, the
fanatic, the fundamentalist, and the bigot- despite the fact that some
may be religiously orthodox or members of an organicist society while
others may be radical libertarians- is a presumed existence in a narrow,
homogenous, unquestioning, and unenlightened universe, an existence that
inherently generates hostility towards outsides, toward questioning,
toward difference. "[Learning tolerance"]{.underline} thus [involves
divesting oneself of relentless partiality, absolutist identity, and
parochial attachments, a process understood as the effect of a larger,
more cosmopolitan worldview and not as the privilege of hegemony. It is
noteworthy, too, that within this discourse the aim of learning
tolerance is not to arrive at equality or solidarity with others but,
rather, to learn how to put up with others by weakening one's own
connections to community and claims of identity]{.underline}- that is,
by becoming a liberal pluralist and thereby joining those who, according
to Michael Ignatieff, an "live and let live" or "love others more by
loving ourselves a little less" Tolerance as the overcoming of the
putative natural enmity among essentialized differences issues from
education and repression, which themselves presume the social contract
and the weakening pf nationalist or other communal identifications.
[Formulated this way, the valuation and practice of tolerance
simultaneously confirm the superiority of the West; depoliticize (by
recasting as nativist enmity) the effects of domination, colonialism,
and cold way deformations of the Second and Third Worlds; and portray
those living these effects as in need of the civilizing project of the
West.]{.underline}

# link: democracy promotion

**The transition to liberal governance generates the very violence that
they attempt to solve.**

**Dillon & Reid, 2000** (Michael and Julian, Lecturer at the University
of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of
London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Humane Governance, Vol.
25 Ish. 1, January-March).

[The violent conflicts associated with]{.underline} such emerging
[political complexes are not simply the persistent
recurrence]{.underline}, as so many contemporary analysts are inclined
to argue, [of fixed and irresolvable historical hatreds. They are very
much a function of the ways in which societies in dissolution, since
they are at the turbulent confluence of local and global dynamics
excited by the diverse military, political, and economic practices of
global liberal governance itself, are in consequence thereby subject to
violent disorder and change]{.underline}. It is that change that
engenders emerging political complexes. While radically reformulating
old identity myths and inventing new ones is a typical feature of such
complexes, so giving the appearance of unchanging historical form, these
are devices by which political and economic forces are mobilized
everywhere in the face of change. That is why they are also an active
part of the political processes by which emerging political complexes
coalesce. It is however quite simplistic to think of them as peculiar to
those regions where complex emergencies are said to occur or the mere
recurrence of unchanging historical truths there. [These practices are
part of the common currency of political mobilization in the domain of
liberal peace as well. It therefore seems obvious that the radical and
continuous transformation of societies that global liberal governance so
assiduously seeks must constitute a significant contribution to the very
violence that it equally also deplores.]{.underline}

**Democracy promotion is inherently undemocratic---citizens have very
little influence over externally imposed governments and are coerced
into new social arrangements.**

**Odysseos---04** (Louiza, Ph.D, Professor of Politics and International
Studies at the University of London, "*Über Die Linie*? Carl Schmitt and
Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on
Terror," September, p. 15-16)

The second strand of cosmopolitanism is neo-liberal in its ideological
location. As Peter Gowan notes, it 'run\[s\] parallel to the discourse
of globalization and rhetorically complement\[s\] it.' It is a
cosmopolitanism that instantiates a rewriting of the principles of
sovereignty and non-intervention, which were regarded as constitutive of
the Westphalian order. Seen as conditional, they 'can be withdrawn
should any states fail to meet the domestic or foreign standards laid
down by the requirements of liberal governance.' In the words of William
Rasch, state sovereignty becomes restricted by 'the simple but
uncontested sovereignty of liberalism itself'. This [neo-liberal
cosmopolitanism]{.underline}, which Gowan associates with US and its
allies and their academic apologists, [often betrays an 'arbitrary
attitude towards enforcing of universalist liberal norms of individual
rights' despite its resting on the argument of a humanity that is
'finally on the verge of being unified in a single, just world
order']{.underline}. [This arbitrariness often results in the imposition
of incoherent domestic and international requirements on states in the
form of legal domestic arrangements that promote individualism and
liberal (i.e. good) governance, but also frequently in the form of
social population control and consumerization]{.underline}. Chantal
Mouffe suggests that [such policies might lead to an increasing
detachment of citizens from their *demos* as a result of the imposition
of externally acceptable arrangements. This would leave liberal
cosmopolitans in the precarious position of losing their democratic
rights of lawmaking.]{.underline} They would be left, at best, with
their liberal right of appealing to transnational courts to defend their
individual rights when those have been violated. In all probability,
such a [cosmopolitan democracy, if it were ever to be realized, would
not be more than an empty name disguising the actual disappearance of
democratic forms of government]{.underline} and indicating the triumph
of the liberal form of governmental rationality that Foucault called
"governmentality".

liberalization to create 'modern' societies. The results are

The disorder of emerging political complexes is of course fueled by
local factors. In a world that has always been more or less
interdependent, however, it would be grossly naive to think that local
factors were ever permanently or totally isolated historically from
global developments.\[2\] Much less so now, then, in an age of virulent
globalization. [Global liberal governance is not, of course, a neutral
phenomenon, indifferent to local cultures, traditions, and practices.
Neither is it benignly disposed toward them. Rather, it has always been
virulently disruptive of them and aggressively related to them as much
in moral as in economic and military terms. Much of the disorder that
borders the domain of liberal peace is clearly also a function,
therefore\--albeit a fiercely contested function\--of its very own
normative, political, economic, and military agenda]{.underline}s,
dynamics, and practices, and of the reverberations these excite
throughout the world. It seems increasingly to be a function,
specifically, of the way in which development is now ideologically
embraced by all of the diverse institutions of liberal peace as an
unrelenting project of modernization.\[3\] The chief economist of the
World Bank (Joseph Stiglitz) attacks the Washington Consensus on
liberalization, stabilization, and privatization in the world economy,
for example, as too technical and too narrowly framed a development
strategy. He espouses instead a new intensive as well as extensive
policy committed to the unqualified and comprehensive modernization and
\"transformation of traditional societies.\"\[4\] \"Honesty, however
requires me to add one more word. In calling for a transformation of
societies, I have elided a central issue,\" Stiglitz had the candor to
conclude, \"transformation to what kind of society and for what ends?\"
[The impact of modernization on modern as well as traditional societies
is,]{.underline} of course, [as violent as the impact on global
resources and global ecology.]{.underline} The values, practices, and
investments that propel such development nonetheless, however, are
precisely what protect it from pursuing the key question, locally as
well as globally, that Stiglitz posed in terms other than those that
underwrite his very problematization of it.

**International law that ultimately relies on state power will not
fundamentally change anything---military advantage will be the guiding

Just as governance is a specific feature of liberalism, so also liberal
peace is therefore a specific form of liberal governmental power. Hence
the peace of global liberal governance differs from other forms of
liberal peace inasmuch as its [liberalism]{.underline} differs from

# link: human rights

**Human rights are a only cover for international violence that fails to
protect individuals because**

a)  **domestic repression is simply replaced by foreign domination,
    and**

b)  **they are a negative protection that cannot promote social
    justice.**

Fatalism, [Wendy
Brown](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v103/103.2brown.html#authbio)).

But in addition to Ignatieff\'s own transgressions of the boundaries he
sets, there is this: [it is in the nature of every significant political
project to ripple beyond the project\'s avowed target and action, for
the simple reason that all such projects are situated in political,
historical, social, and economic contexts with which they dynamically
engage. No effective project produces only the consequences it aims to
produce]{.underline}. Whatever their avowed purpose, then, do human
rights only reduce suffering? Do they (promise to) reduce it in a
particular way that precludes or negates other possible ways? And if
they reduce suffering, what kinds of subjects and political (or
antipolitical) cultures do they bring into being as they do so, what
kinds do they transform or erode, and what kinds do they aver? What are
the implications of human rights assuming center stage as an
international justice project, or as *the* progressive international
justice project? Human rights activism is a moral-political project and
if it displaces, competes with, refuses, or rejects other political
projects, including those also aimed at producing justice, then it is
not merely a tactic but a particular form of political power carrying a
particular image of justice, and it will behoove us to inspect,
evaluate, and judge it as such. Such considerations require us to depart
both the terms of pragmatist minimalism and the terms of morality for a
more complex encounter with the powers of political context and
political discourse than either set of terms can accommodate. For the
most part, [human rights activism]{.underline} refuses the political
mantle on which I am insisting. Rather, it generally [presents itself as
something of an antipolitics---a pure defense of the innocent and the
powerless against power]{.underline}, a pure defense of the individual
against immense and potentially cruel or despotic machineries of
culture, state, war, ethnic conflict, tribalism, patriarchy, and other
mobilizations or instantiations of collective power against individuals.
More precisely, human rights take their shape as a moral discourse
centered on pain and suffering rather than political discourse of
comprehensive justice. Even as Ignatieff titles his first lecture
\"Human Rights as Politics\" and recognizes that \"human rights must
accept that it is a fighting creed and that its universal claims will be
resisted\" by whatever authority is its particular target, the politics
he identifies are in the pragmatic effects of what he forthrightly
identifies as a moral order of things: \"Human rights is the language
that systematically embodies \[the\] intuition \[that each individual is
entitled to equal moral consideration\], and to the degree that this
intuition gains influence over the conduct of individuals and states, we
can say that we are making moral progress\" (4). In addition to the
explicit claim about moral equality, international human rights are also
premised on the immorality of politically induced suffering. Unlike
constitutionally derived and nationally enforced highly specified rights
in liberal democratic orders, international human rights are cast in
terms of the moral inviolability of \"human dignity\" and the
deprivation or degradation of this dignity that they are understood to
protect against. Human rights, in Ignatieff\'s understanding, do not
prescribe what is good or right but rather depend on agreement \"about
what is insufferably, inarguably wrong\" (56): The universal commitments
implied by human rights can be compatible with a wide variety of ways of
living only if the universalism implied is self-consciously minimalist.
Human rights can command universal assent only as a decidedly \"thin\"
theory of what is right, a definition of the minimum conditions for any
kind of life at all. Human rights is only a systematic agenda of
\"negative liberty,\" a tool kit against oppression, a tool kit that
individual agents must be free to use as they see fit within the broader
frame of cultural and religious beliefs that they live by. (56, 57) But
if human rights are tendered as an antipolitical and expressly moral
antidote to abusive political power, a defense against power and a
protection against pain, deprivation, or suffering, we may still ask
what kind of politicization they set in motion against the powers they
oppose. Do they stand for a different formulation of justice or do they
stand in opposition to collective justice projects? Whether they aim
either to weaken national political sovereignty as they strengthen the
moral standing of the individual or, to the contrary as Ignatieff
argues, they underline the \"necessity of state order as a guarantee of
rights,\" and hence ought actually to strengthen \"overburdened
states,\" what kind of justice project is this? Put another way, if
human rights are proffered as a defense against political power\'s
ability to inflict pain, indignity, cruelty, and death, if they stand
for political power\'s moral limit regardless of its internal
organization or legitimacy, what is their political positioning and
effect in this work? As it turns out, Ignatieff does not, indeed cannot,
limit his brief for human rights to their attenuation of suffering.
Rather, he understands them as opening up progressive political
possibility that exceeds their purview. He claims, first, that \"human
rights matter because they help people to help themselves\" and thus
instantiate or develop agency where it did not exist before (57). He
claims, second, that rights as \"civil and political freedoms are the
necessary condition for the eventual attainment of social and economic
security\" (90). Third, he claims that rights language creates the basis
for \[End Page 454\] \"conflict, deliberation, argument and
contention,\" as it provides a \"shared vocabulary from which our
arguments can begin, and the bare human minimum from which differing
ideas of human flourishing can take root\" (95). The first claim
concerns the ontological logic of human rights; the second claim
concerns the historical logic of human rights; and the third claim
concerns the political logic of human rights. Let us consider each
briefly. \"Human rights is a language of individual empowerment,\"
Ignatieff argues, and \"when individuals have agency, they can protect
themselves against injustice. Equally, when individuals have agency,
they can define themselves what they wish to live and die for\" (57). In
other words, human rights configure subjects as either able or entitled
(it\'s not clear which for Ignatieff) to protect themselves from what
they consider unjust and define for themselves what their individual
aims and ends are. As Ignatieff argues elsewhere, \"Rights language has
been central not simply to the protection, but also to the production of
modern individuals,\" a production that he specifies as the process of
becoming an individual---\"the most universal aspiration behind all the
forms of modernity on
offer.\"[3](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v103/103.2brown.html#FOOT3)
But [it is not at all clear that human rights discourse actually
secures]{.underline} the [autonomy and agency]{.underline} Ignatieff
promises; rather, [this discourse offers a form of protection for
individuals that may trade one form of subjection for another, an
intervention by an external agent or set of institutions that promises
to protect individuals from abusive state power in part by replacing
that power]{.underline}. (A recent and very literal case of such an
exchange was, of course, the intervention in Iraq by the United States
and Britain, commencing in spring 2003 and continuing through the
present, which carried the flag of human rights and which Ignatieff, in
several major press venues, has at times defended as a human rights
effort.[4](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v103/103.2brown.html#FOOT4))
While the replacement may or may not be a positive one from the
standpoint of reducing suffering, it does not follow that it necessarily
produces agency or \"helps people to help themselves.\"
[Moreover,]{.underline} to the extent that human rights are understood
as the ability to protect oneself against injustice and define one\'s
own ends in life, [this is a form of \"empowerment\" that fully equates
empowerment with liberal individualism. As such, the promise of rights
to enable the individual\'s capacity to choose what one wishes to live
and die for does not address the historical, political, and economic
constraints in which this choice occurs]{.underline}---agency is defined
as choice within these constraints and thus largely codifies these
constraints. Finally, if rights promise a shield around individuals, the
\"right \[End Page 455\] to choose the life they see fit to lead\" (57),
[this shield constitutes a juridical limit on regimes without empowering
individuals as political actors]{.underline}; rather, it is an instance
of what Isaiah Berlin called and Ignatieff endorses as \"negative
liberty,\" the right to be let alone to do as one wishes (57).

**Human rights act in opposition to projects for political
transformation:**

a)  **negative rights are atomizing, they do not create social
    solidarity**

b)  **the historical record clearly demonstrates that rights foster

Fatalism, [Wendy
Brown](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v103/103.2brown.html#authbio)).

Taken together, Ignatieff\'s three [claims about the political
possibilities set in motion by human rights]{.underline}---far from
representing the minimalism with which we began---[are building blocks
for an argument that this discourse can inaugurate a different
distribution of power and order of justice in nonliberal
societies.]{.underline} If this were so, it would constitute a new
historical formation, a new chronology in history, in which rights would
constitute the engine rather than the outcome of a form of popular
political power, the basis for democratic participation rather than the
containment of it, the place from which democracy starts rather than
ends. [Not only is this untried, this insistence]{.underline} also
conflicts with Ignatieff\'s own notion of rights as a form of protection
from power and conflict as well as with his corollary claim for
tolerance as the ability to \"live and let
live.\"[7](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v103/103.2brown.html#FOOT7)
It [collides with the rejection of politics---the retreat from the
problem of collective power---that the right to live as one wishes
promises. Moreover, it introduces an unresolved interval between the
expressly moral and antipolitical discourse of human rights and a
politicization that this discourse is claimed to promise. Perhaps most
importantly, it formulates political and social power as a zero-sum
game: rights against culture or the state become a measure of power
taken away from them---what the individual has, the institutions don\'t
get]{.underline}. Few modern thinkers still subscribe to this
formulation of power. Even apart from the Foucauldian insight into the
regulatory dimension of rights that challenges it---an insight into the
production of subjects and subjectification by juridical
discourse---[there is the patent empirical fact that Americans have
never had so many rights]{.underline} (even the lawyers can\'t keep
track of them) [and so little power to shape collective
justice]{.underline} and national aims. What we have learned in the last
century: [if rights secure the possibility of living without fear of
express state coercion, they do not thereby decrease the overall
power]{.underline} and reach of [the state nor do they enhance the
collective power of the citizenry to determine]{.underline} the contours

themselves be tactics and vehicles of governance and

**Tolerance for the other easily slips into an excuse for military
aggression if the gesture is not reciprocated.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

[Tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant,
it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers
protection or incorporation to the less powerful, and tolerance as an
individual virtue has a similar asymmetrical structure. The ethical
bearing of tolerance is high-minded, while the object of such
high-mindedness is inevitably figured as something more
lowly]{.underline}. Even as the outlandish, wrongheaded, or literal
outlaw is licensed or suffered through tolerance, the voice in which
tolerance is proffered contrasts starkly with the qualities attributed
to its object. The pronouncement \"I am a tolerant man\" conjures
seemliness, propriety, forbearance, magnanimity, cosmopolitanism,
universality, and the large view, while those for whom tolerance is
required take their shape as improper, indecorous, urgent, narrow,
particular, and often ungenerous or at least lacking in perspective.
Liberals who philosophize about tolerance almost always write about
coping with what they cannot imagine themselves to be: they identify
with the aristocrat holding his nose in the agora, not with the stench.
Historically and philosophically, tolerance is rarely argued for as an
entitlement, a right, or a naturally egalitarian good in the ways that
liberty generally is. Rather, one pleads for tolerance as an
incorporative practice that promises to keep the peace through such
incorporation. And so the subterranean yearning of tolerance-for a
universally practiced moderation that does not exist, a humanity so
civilized that it would not require the virtue of tolerance-sits
uneasily with the normative aspect of tolerance that reaffirms the
characterological superiority of the tolerant over the tolerated.
Attention to these rhetorical aspects of tolerance suggests that it is
not simply asymmetrical across lines of power but carries caste, class,
and civilizational airs with it in its work. This chapter scrutinizes
that conveyance by considering the logic of tolerance as a
civilizational discourse. [The dual function of civilizational
discourse, marking in general what counts as \"civilized\" and
conferring superiority on the West, produces]{.underline} tolerance
itself in two distinct, if intersecting[, power functions: as part of
what defines the superiority of Western civilization, and as that which
marks certain non-Western practices or regimes as intolerable. Together,
these operations of tolerance discourse in a civilizational frame
legitimize liberal polities\' illiberal treatment of selected practices,
peoples, and states.]{.underline} They sanction illiberal aggression
toward what is marked as intolerable without tarring the \"civilized\"
status of the aggressor. Shortly after September 11th, George W. Bush
asserted: \"Those who hate all civilization and culture and progress . .
. cannot be ignored, cannot be appeased. They must be fought.
\"Tolerance, a beacon of civilization, is inappropriately extended to
those outside civilization and opposed to civilization; violence, which
tolerance represses, is the only means of dealing with this threat and
is thereby self-justifying. When this statement is paired with remarks
in February 2002, in which Bush declared the United States to have a
\"historic opportunity to fight a war that will not only liberate people
from the clutches of barbaric behavior but a war that can leave the
world more peaceful in the years to come,\"3 [it is not difficult to see
how an opposition between civilization and barbarism, in which the
cherished tolerance of the former meets its limits in the
latter]{.underline} (limits that also give the latter its identity[),
provides the mantle of civilization, progress, and peace as cover for
imperial militaristic adventures.]{.underline} If being beyond the pale
of civilization is also to be what civilization cannot tolerate, then
tolerance and civilization not only entail one another but mutually
define what is outside of both and together constitute a strand in an
emerging transnational governmentality. To be uncivilized is to be
intolerable is to be a barbarian, just as to declare a particular
practice intolerable is to stigmatize it as uncivilized. That which is
inside civilization is tolerable and tolerant; that which is outside is
neither. [This is how, even amid plural definitions of civilization, the
discourse of tolerance recenters the West as the standard for
civilization, and how tolerance operates simultaneously as a token of
Western supremacy and a legitimating cloak for Western
domination]{.underline}.

**Human rights promote a very limited definition of what counts as
political action, and, hence, what it means to be human. Those who
resist are forced to conform.**

**Odysseos---04** (Louiza, Ph.D, Professor of Politics and International
Studies at the University of London, "*Über Die Linie*? Carl Schmitt and
Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on
Terror," September, p. 18-19)

There are two ways in which [the discourse of a 'universal humanity' has
a strong disciplining effect on peoples and polities]{.underline}. The
first, noted by a number of commentators, involves the [political
refutation of the tolerance witnessed in the cultural or private
sphere]{.underline}; in other words, [politically, cosmopolitanism shows
little tolerance for what it designates as 'intolerant' politics, which
is any politics that moves in opposition to its ideals, rendering
political opposition to it illegitimate. Cosmopolitan discourses are
also defined by a claim to their own exception and
superiority]{.underline}. They naturalize the historical origins of
liberal sciences which are no longer regarded as 'contingently
established and historically conditioned forms of organization'; rather,
they become the universal standard against which other societies are
judged. Those found wanting banished, as outlaws, from which the
civilized world. Ironically, one of the signs of their outlaw status is
their insistence on autonomy, on sovereignty. [The second disciplining
effect of the discourse of humanity is seen in the tendency to normalize
diverse peoples through 'individualization'. The paramount emphasis
placed on legal instruments such as human rights transforms diverse
subjectivities into 'rights-holders'.]{.underline} As Rasch argues ['the
other is stripped of his otherness and made to conform to the universal
ideal of what it means to be human]{.underline}'. The [international
human rights regime, which cosmopolitanism champions]{.underline} as a
pure expression of the centrality of the individual and to which it is
theoretically and ontologically committed, [is the exportation of modern
subjectivity around the globe. The discourse of humanity expressed
through human rights involves a transformation of the human into the
rights-holder: '\[o\]nce again we see that the term "human" is not
descriptive, but evaluative. To be truly human, one needs to be
corrected]{.underline}.

**Social services inherently create a vision of the poor as indebted,
useless consumers.**

**Arnold 05** (Kathleen, Assistant Professor of political and feminist
theory @ U. of Texas, San Antonio, "Asceticism in Contemporary Political
Theory: Marx, Weber, Nietzsche and Beyond," Theory & Event, ProjectMUSE)

In the current political environment, ascetic demands and [values are
not only preached to the poor but imposed on them in welfare/workfare
laws and low wage and deregulation policies.]{.underline} Marx
recognized the hypocrisy in these demands that the poor save, for
example, or abstain from alcohol or sex, or eat less when the wealthy
often do not do any of these things. [To apply Nietzsche]{.underline} to
Marx, [it could be said that the asceticism preached to the poor is not
a will to power but characterized by *ressentiment*. In Nietzsche\'s
words, those who promote asceticism (policy makers, welfare caseworkers,
editorial writers) say \"no\" to the poor \-- what is outside, what is
different, not itself, the economic mainstream. That is, in the same way
that Nietzsche conceives of the weak in society formulating an ethos
that is simply a reaction to the more powerful other,]{.underline} the
response to the poor comes
paradoxically[^124^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v008/8.2arnold.html#_edn124)
from a position of weakness or uncertainty. [In part, this is because
economic power is not always stable; the poor represent a loss in what
is conceived of as a zero sum game. A welfare recipient can represent
\"a purely receptive, expending, and consuming agency, an *apparently*
useless
mouth.\"]{.underline}[[^125^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v008/8.2arnold.html#_edn125)
The resentment of the rich is based on feelings of]{.underline}
*Schuld*[, debt and guilt that have been projected back onto the
poor.]{.underline} Alternatively, the well-off view not only their work
as a sign of grace but also their spending. In contemporary times, stock
market speculation, gambling, and investment in various properties can
be viewed not as pure excess but a sacrifice, a contribution (and a
manifestation of \"self-interest properly understood\"). George W. Bush
confirmed this after the attacks of September 11^th^, 2001, when he
urged all citizens to continue spending money and shopping.

**Political solutions to inequality are rooted in a suicidal slave
morality and nihilistic deference to the state.**

**Brown, 2000** (Wendy, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Princeton
University and UC Berkeley Humanities Fellow "Nietzsche for Politics" in
"Why Nietzsche Still?" Edited by Alan Schrift, pg. 217)

[If Nietzsche bears some ambivalence toward philosophy in the name of
life, there is no such ambiguity in his open hostility toward politics,
where the latter encompasses moral doctrines such as
equality,]{.underline} institutions such as the state and political
parties, politicians, righteous position taking, [and policy making.
Nietzsche\'s objections to moral political doctrine, especially
liberalism, include his notorious disdain for the rabble and for the
\"little men\" whose envious, petty, and poisonous nature he believes
sap all strength from a culture. Nietzsche\'s critique of political
solutions to unfairness and injustice and their origins in resentment
and revenge is distilled in his forthright claim, \"\'Men are not
equal\' .]{.underline} \' . life wants to climb and overcome itself
climbing\" (2:2 \"On the Tarantulas[\"). If liberal doctrine thus
inevitably partakes of slave morality, when this critique is compounded
by Nietzsche\'s despisal of the state-\"coldest of all cold monsters
\... where the slow suicide of all is called \'life\'\" -then all
state-centered political formations, whether socialist, democratic, or
totalitarian, appear even more antagonistic than philosophy to \"life\"
and culture]{.underline} (2:r \"On the New Idol\"), \"The better the
state is established,\" Nietzsche polemicizes, \"the fainter is
humanity.\" 25 Even these critiques do not plumb the depths of
[Nietzsche\'s]{.underline} hostility to politics, a hostility many have
termed aesthetic but that might be better understood as an intense
[*anti-institutionalism* rooted in his critique of slave morality.
\"\'The will to power\' is so hated in democratic ages,\" he argues,
\"that their entire psychology seems directed towards belittling and
defaming it\"]{.underline} (WP 751).In *Twilight ofthe Idols,* Nietzsche
emphasizes the massified, deindividualizing character of democratic
institutions, the way in which they lose \"man\" in a regime putatively
designed to protect\" everyman\": \"Equality\" , .. belongs essentially
to decline: the chasm between man and man, class and class, the
multiplicity of types, the will to be oneself, to stand out-that which I
call *pathos of* distance-characterizes every *strong* age. The tension,
the range between the extremes is today growing less and less\~ the
extremes themselves are finally obliterated to the point of similarity.

**Laws protecting free speech legitimate the state as the protector of
the individual while real threats to dissent, such as the corporate
media are allowed to crush anything deemed un-American.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

[Even tolerance discourse concerned with free speech and dissent can be
turned into a tactic of citizen subjection and technology of increased
state power in a crisis such as the current war on
terrorism]{.underline}. Free speech is subverted through a reversal of
the state-citizen circuitry described above; this time, the state does
the tolerating/protecting, while turning civil society into the scene
for intolerant vigilantism. [The state promises to protect free speech
and dissent, while declaring at the same time that \"if you\'re not for
us, you\'re with the terrorists,\" thereby allying dissent with support
for the enemy. Dissent becomes equated seen, the limit condition of
tolerance is fealty to the nation, expressed through identification with
and loyalty to the nation-state. Within the logic of \"if you\'re not
with us, you\'re against us,\" dissenters are not eligible for
tolerance; moreover, if they are giving \"aid and comfort to the
enemy,\" there is every reason not to tolerate them.\" So, even as they
are formally protected by the state in their right to dissent, when the
equation of dissent with un-Americanness is taken up by corporations,
the media, and other powers in civil society,]{.underline} dissenters
can be pulled from the airwaves, from the pages of magazines, from
educational forums, and occasionally from academic and other positions
at what appears to be the behest of the citizenry, not the orders of the
state. [The combination of popular and commercial power in constraining
or filtering dissent]{.underline} (mainly by limiting its venues)
[leaves the state appearing as a protector of free speech, even as it
has provided the rationale for curtailing it.]{.underline}

# link: levinas

**Levinas gives absolute priority of ethics before politics---making
ethics a universal obligation that becomes the basis of human rights and
the need to intervene all over the world.**

**Meister, 05** (Postmodern Culture, \"Never Again\": The Ethics of the
Neighbor and the Logic of Genocide

15.2, Robert, Department of Politics, UC Santa Cruz).

[Lévinas\'s point is that in ethics, unlike politics, we do not ask who
came first and what we have already done to (or for) each
other]{.underline}. The distinctively ethical question is rather one of
proximity\--we are already here and so is the other, cheek-by-jowl with
us in the same place. The neighbor is the figure of the other toward
whom our *only* relationship is that of proximity. [For Lévinas, the
global movement to give ethics primacy over politics must be
accompanied, *within* ethics, by the effort to give primacy to the
ethics of the neighbor]{.underline}\--the local over the global. In this
way, the global primacy of ethics crystallizes around our horror of the
inhuman act (the \"gross\" violation of human rights) rather than, for
example, around the international distribution of wealth or the effects
of global climate change. Proximity is, thus, the marker that
distinguishes an ethics of the neighbor as a basis for human rights from
global concerns about injustice that might also be considered ethical.
Proximity is not itself a merely spatial concept\--both space and time
can be proximate or distant\--but it is useful to think of the ethics of
the neighbor as a *spatializing* discourse within ethics, as distinct
from a \"temporalizing\" discourse that subordinates ethics to political
rhetorics associated with memory and identity (Boyarin, \"Space\" 20).
The latter is held accountable for the atrocities of the twentieth
century because it suggests that the suffering of one\'s immediate
neighbor can be justified through an historical narrative that links it
to redeeming the suffering of someone else, perhaps an ancestor or a
comrade, to whom one claims an historical relationship that is
\"closer\" than relations among neighbors. To regard proximity of
*place* as the ethical foundation of politics is to resist this tendency
from the beginning, and thereby to set the stage for the *fin-de-siècle*
project of transitional justice, which is both the alternative to human
rights interventions and their professed aim. Transitional justice
assigns to historical enemies the task of living as neighbors in the
same place. It employs *techniques* of reconciliation to create new and
better relationships between previously warring groups, but the
*imperative* to reconcile is ultimately ethical in Lévinas\'s sense.
That imperative is based on no relationship other than proximity and
mutual vulnerability\--the ever-present possibility that they will
murder each other. If the subjects of transitional justice fail to
reconcile, and mass murders occur, these atrocities are liable to be
considered crimes against humanity that justify outside intervention. In
the now-massive literature on transitional justice, gross violations of
human rights are always assumed to be local, occurring between neighbors
who occupy common ground, and the responders are treated as third
parties who intervene (or fail to do so) from afar. [Even if the
responders have an historical connection to the site of intervention,
perhaps as one-time colonizers, they are considered to be driven by
ethics, as distinct from politics, in their willingness to respond on
behalf of the world community that should never again stand by while
neighbors murder each other. It is implicit in this emerging conception
that the site of ethics is the space of the neighbor]{.underline} (or
neighborhood) [and that the site of politics is global]{.underline}.
Global intervention in the local can be justified in the name of
universal human rights; but violence aimed at global causes of suffering
(such as the Seattle riots against the WTO or the Chiapas rebellion
against NAFTA) is not seen as a form of humanitarian direct action on a
par with bombing Belgrade or Baghdad. In the emergent global discourse
on human rights, \"Nothing essential to a person\'s human essence is
violated if he or she suffers as a consequence of military action or of
market manipulation from beyond his own state when that is permitted by
international law\" (Asad, \"Redeeming the \'Human\'\" 129). A perverse
effect of the global \"culture\" of protecting local human rights is
thus to take the global causes of human suffering off the political
agenda. [Any direct action taken against global forces runs the risk of
being considered a violation of universal human rights]{.underline} (a
violation such as \"terrorism\") in the locality where it occurs.

**Don't let them claim that they only create an ethical obligation in a
particular instance---Levinasian ethics demand recognition of a
universal duty---individual situations are only a proxy for this larger
obligation.**

**Meister, 05** (Postmodern Culture, \"Never Again\": The Ethics of the
Neighbor and the Logic of Genocide

15.2, Robert, Department of Politics, UC Santa Cruz).

Without belaboring the obvious tension suggested here between the
message of Judaism, thus described, and political Zionism, it is clear
that this quote privileges the position of the refugee over the claims
of both settler and native, and treats the territory as a place of
refuge harboring potential neighbors for whom bad history is always yet
to come. [The space of the neighbor (the neighborhood) is no longer a
\"situation\" for which we share attachments; it is here mystified as a
pure relationship of being in the presence of, and answerable to,
another face. What makes this relationship quintessentially ethical,
according to Lévinas, is that the neighbor does not approach us first
with the political identify]{.underline} of friend or foe, and with the
claim to be recognized accordingly. [Rather, the neighbor\'s first
demand is placed upon us by pure proximity\--not because we feel
*closer* to our neighbor than to someone else, but because his proximity
makes us answer for our responsibility to the more distant stranger for
whom he also substitutes]{.underline} (see \"Substitution\"). In
Lévinas\'s ethic of the neighbor, \"The proximity of the neighbor\--the
peace of proximity\--is the responsibility of the ego for an other\"
(\"Peace and Proximity\" 167).

# link: levinas

**Infinite obligation to the other fails in the face of two political
realities:**

1)  **It becomes an excuse for permanent war against those seen as
    violators of the ethical order, and**

2)  **The example of the suicide bomber renders those ethics
    incoherent---who is saved by allowing the determined suicide bomber
    to live?**

**Meister, 05** (Postmodern Culture, \"Never Again\": The Ethics of the
Neighbor and the Logic of Genocide

15.2, Robert, Department of Politics, UC Santa Cruz).

It is, of course, possible to attack Lévinas using Carl Schmitt\'s
argument against [the discourse of humanitarian
intervention]{.underline} following the Treaty of Versailles: that it
[creates a *casus belli* against the forces of
\"inhumanity,\"]{.underline} especially when they claim to be pursuing
historical justice in ways that disturb the peace by treating the
\"other\" as the \"same\" (Schmitt, *The Concept of the Political* 71).
[Suicide bombings would seem to be a paradigmatic example]{.underline}
of this: encountering the other as a disguised human bomb would suggest
that fear *of* her and fear *for* her are not as fundamentally distinct
as Lévinas himself claims. [When we rescue the suicide bomber are we
saving her or ourselves?]{.underline} And if we murder her instead, what
becomes of us? Do we reveal ourselves, like those whom Lévinas condemns,
to be more afraid of dying than of killing? What does it mean for her to
be equally unafraid of both? And does her self-chosen death qualify her
as a martyr or a monster, whether or not she succeeds in bringing
innocent others to their deaths along with her? In certain political
\"neighborhoods,\" [Lévinas\'s concept of the ultimately unknowable
human face can be both ethical and awful in ways that reopen the
possibility of a horrifying response. The ethical temptation to treat
suicide bombers as \"inhumans\" in human disguise applies *a fortiori*
to the politics of third-party intervention raised at the beginning of
this essay: when neighbors kill neighbors, whom do we rescue and whom do
we attack?]{.underline} Is the third party in this situation just
another neighbor?

**The dark side of Levinasian ethics are their potential to justify
terrible evil. For instance, absolutist political obligations undergird
genocide as much as they do political campaigns to end violence or
poverty.**

Chicago -- 2003 (Jacob, John Hopkins University Press, "Politics Against

[Levinas' account of redemption,]{.underline} mediated by his
conversation with the Rabbis and Samuel, [suggests that ideals of purity
and deliverance]{.underline} are not confined to religious or
theological matters, but often penetrate political conversations, and
this is why I call politics that are animated by such ideals "redemptive
politics". [Redemptive politics work in the service of projects that
most people would probably recognize as "good"\--for instance, in calls
to end all war]{.underline} (UNOPI, 1965; Lipsky, 1971), [genocide,
hunger, poverty, homelessness, drug use, racism, and violent crime. But
redemptive politics also work in the service of projects that most
people would probably recognize as "bad". For instance, redemptive
politics seem to underpin genocide. During the Rwandan genocide, Hutu
extremists referred to Tutsis as]{.underline} inyenzi, or cockroaches,
as [pests that needed to be exterminated]{.underline} (Prunier, 1995).
Similarly, [Nazi ideology portrayed Jews as dirty, a plague infesting
German stock. These depictions tied genocidal campaigns to the
achievement and maintenance of purity for a given identity]{.underline},
whether Rwandan or German.6 Furthermore, many scholars have
characterized genocidal projects in redemptive terms. Leo Kuper, for
instance, has highlighted scape-goating in genocides (1981: 43). [In
times of social and economic turmoil]{.underline}\--say, Germany in the
1930s\--[it is easy to blame prominent minority groups for social,
economic, and political ills. That which we cannot
abide]{.underline}---military defeat, economic depression and so
on---[we]{.underline} may [cast off by locating responsibility for our
condition elsewhere]{.underline}.7 Ronald Aronson (1982:144) has
characterized [genocide as "a kind of ultimate denial of reality: a
madness of those in power who are impotent to use that power effectively
to change reality, and who, lost in visions of omnipotence, instead seek
to destroy it".]{.underline} Finally, Robert Jay Lifton has argued that
[genocide involves "a perception of collective illness, a vision of
cure, and a series of motivations, experiences, and requirements of
perpetrators in their quest for that cure"]{.underline} (Lifton 1986, p.
467; in Fein, 1993, p.46). [Scape-goating, denial of reality, and
metaphors of illness and cure all call up drives to purification that
are symptomatic of redemptive politics.]{.underline}

**The notion that our personal ethical orientation is transformative is
an overly simplistic substitute for real politics and props up a Western
concept of the individual.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

The legal and political formalism of liberalism, in which most of what
transpires in the spaces designated as cultural, social, economic, and
private is considered natural or personal (in any event, independent of
power and political life), is a profound achievement of
depoliticization. [Liberalism's excessive freighting of the individual
subject with self- making, agency, and a relentless responsibility for
itself also contributes to the personalization of political contoured
conflicts and inequalities. These tendencies eliminate from view various
norms and social relations- especially those pertaining to capital,
race, gender, and sexuality- that construct and position subjects in
liberal democracies. In addition, the reduction of freedom to rights,
and of equality to equal standing before the law, eliminates from view
many sources of subordination, marginalization, and inequality that
organize liberal democratic societies and fashion their
subjects]{.underline}. Liberal ideology at its most generic, then,
always already eschews power and history in its articulation and
comprehensions of the social and the subject. Individualism. The
American cultural emphasis on the importance of individual belief and
behavior, and of individual heroism and failure, is also relentlessly
depoliticizing. [An identification of belief, attitude, moral fiber, and
individual will with the capacity to make world history is the calling
card of the biographical backstories and anecdotes that so often
substitute for political analyses and considerations of
power]{.underline} in American popular culture. From Horatio Algers to
demonized welfare mothers, from Private Jessica Lynch to Private Lynndie
England, from mythohistories to mythobiographies, [we are awash in the
conceits that right attitudes produce justice, that willpower and
tenacity produce success, and that everything else is, at most,
background, context, luck, or accidents of history. It is a child's view
of history and politics: idealist, personal, and replete with heroes and
villains, good values and bad]{.underline}.

# link: categorical imperative

**The categorical imperative is utterly incompatible with Nietzsche's
ethics---individuals needs to decide their own grounds for ethics.**

**Warren, 88** (Mark, Professor at the University of British Colombia,
[Nietzsche and Political Thought,]{.underline} MIT Press)

Nietzsehe\'s critique is based on Kant\'s failure to realize the
immanent potential of his moral philosophy, a failure that could, in
Nietzsche\'s view, be traced to the very nature of Kant\'s project.
Kant\'s intention was to provide a rational foundation for Christian
morality when Christian faith was being seriously eroded by the new
sciences of the Enlightenment. Thus it is hardly surprising that
[Nietzsche ultimately finds Kant\'s project impossible]{.underline}, and
consisting in the last analysis in a continuation of Christian
*Sittlichkeit.* In Nietzsche\'s assessment, this continuity shows up
most clearly in Kant\'s categorical imperative, demanding as it does
obedience to universalizable maxims of behavior. [He finds in Kant a
residue of social oppression refracted into and maintained by Christian
morality.]{.underline} \"[The categorical imperative,\"]{.underline} he
remarks in the *Genealogy,* \"[smells of cruelty]{.underline}.\" 58
[Kant]{.underline} in effect [undermined]{.underline} his ideal of
[autonomy by defining it in terms of the categorical
imperative]{.underline} and so detaching it from situated and reflexive
practices. In this way [he carried the ideological effects of previous
social morality]{.underline} into his attempt [to provide a rational
basis for individual morality. According to Nietzsche]{.underline}, a
workable equation between autonomy and responsibility would require even
these last remnants of *Sittlichkeit* to be overcome, \"for
[\'autonomous\' and \'moral\']{.underline} *\[sittlich\]* [are mutually
exclusive]{.underline}.\" 59 While Kant holds that action in accordance
with the categorical imperative would produce freedom, [Nietzsche holds
that the capacity for moral responsibility requires freedom
from]{.underline} all residues of*Sittlichkeit,* [the categorical
imperative]{.underline} included. That Nietzsche would sever all
conceptual relations between *Sittlichkeit* and autonomy does not,
however, mean that he dissociates them historically. Past beliefs and
practices need not have been rational for them to have produced
practices subsequently lending themselves to rational action (chapter
3). And so it is with *die Sittlichkeit der Sitte,* the \"morality of
mores.\" Because Nietzsche, like Aristotle, Hegel, and Marx, takes human
nature to be \"cultivated\" *(ziichtet)* over time, he ascribes
importance to the \"morality of mores\" for cultivating the kind of
agent capable of responsible action, \"notwithstanding the severity,
tyranny, stupidity, and idiocy involved in it.\" 60 Owing to the
\"prehistoric labor\" of the \"morality of mores,\" it is now possible,
Nietzsche thinks, to conceive of a morality that would lend itself to
responsible, autonomous, individual practices. Nietzsche\'s model of
autonomy is his \"sovereign individual.\" In two well-known sections of
the *Genealogy,* he describes the sovereign individual as the \"ripest
fruit\" ofthe \"tremendous process\" offorging human nature into
something \"regular, calculable, necessary, even in his own image of
himself.\" 61 [Two\' distinct qualities are present in the sovereign
individual: he represents a self-overcoming]{.underline}
*(Selbstaujhebung)* [of the morality of mores into moral responsibility;
and he represents the kind of individual who has the capacity to
practice this morality by virtue of a fully developed agency, providing
the power that gives the \"right to make promises]{.underline}.\" 62 For
a morality to be truly responsible, one must have the capacity to
anticipate the consequences of one\'s actions, and in this way to
\"stand in security\" of the future.

# link: ethics of the other

**Radical responsibility for the other is narcissistic and lends itself
to political passivity---we feel that we have fulfilled our duty simply
by experiencing shame.**

**Murphy, 04** (Ann, Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of philosophy at
the university of New South Wales, "The Political Significance of
Shame," Borderlands E-Journal, volume 3 Number 1, 2004)

2\. The insistence on the ahistorical nature of responsibility is
particularly obvious when one takes note of [Shame is]{.underline} of
interest as a [political phenomenon]{.underline} to the degree that [it
signals]{.underline} cognisance of individual and [collective
responsibility.]{.underline} Knowing this, one should take note of the
dangerous dismissal of guilt and shame in contemporary politics by both
the right and the left. The right's attack on guilt has frequently been
couched in terms of the \"bleeding heart liberal,\" whose attempts to be
empathetic to others is condemned as a delusional and wrong-headed
approach to issues of cultural difference. In an attempt to publicly
undermine the efficacy of social policies such as welfare, the right has
persisted in labelling the advocates of such policies \"bleeding
hearts,\" whose rational capacity for judgment has been clouded by their
emotions. Allegedly, \"bleeding hearts\" cannot be trusted to rationally
deliberate issues of politics. This line of argumentation is likely
grounded in the belief that we inherit from Kant, and those who work in
his wake, that justice in its proper sense is to be rendered via the
avenues of reason, and not those of the heart. In this context, shame
and guilt become problematic insofar as they hamper political
rationality. 3. It would be disingenuous, however, to assign blame
wholly to the political right. To be fair -- and admittedly with a few
notable exceptions -- the discourse on shame has arguably suffered equal
abuse at the hands of the left. While there is no disputing the claim
that the right has frequently coopted the discourse on empathy in order
to shirk certain social responsibilities, it is also the case that the
left has demonstrated a marked reluctance to delve into the politics of
collective guilt. Particularly [amidst a theoretical
landscape]{.underline} -- inherited from Levinas and Derrida -- [that
privileges the stranger, the foreigner, and the radically other, the
worry surrounding guilt and shame is that there is something in the
experience of these emotions that is perhaps narcissistic, indulgent,
and even patronizing]{.underline}. In short, [the fear of addressing
shame and guilt is grounded in the worry that these emotions in the end
only recuperate certain privileges. Shame and guilt are self-regarding
emotions, and so one worries that they may detract from the genuine
consideration of others and that at heart they are egoistic. Add to this
the worry that guilt in and of its own right does not necessarily
motivate concrete action, and one sees why even those with progressive
political agendas express reticence regarding the issue of guilt, not
simply in regard to the danger of appearing patronizing, but likewise
out of suspicion regarding its efficacy in motivating
action.]{.underline}

# link: ethics of the other

**The ethics of the obligation to the other fall flat in the face of
real situations---respect for the other becomes respect for those who
are fundamentally like us.**

**Brown, 04** (Nicholas, University of Illinois at Chicago, Or, Alain
Badiou and Slavoj Žižek, Waiting for Something to Happen, CR: The New
Centennial Review 4.3 (2004) 289-319).

[What guarantees the otherness of the other]{.underline} in the absence
of the Absolutely Other? [Nothing, which means it can only be
posited.]{.underline} What this implies, first of all, is that [**the
ineffable other is a product of my own thought** and therefore not other
at all.]{.underline} Second, we are compelled to ask: why this will to
otherness? Once again, Badiou critiques the laicized, multiculturalist
version of this ethics by staging it. In its everyday form, without the
support of the Altogether Other, [the ethics of difference bifurcates as
soon as it is put into play]{.underline}. Its attitude towards any
rigorously sustained difference is entirely different from the attitude
it believes itself to have towards difference-as-such[. A rigorously
sustained religious difference? Fundamentalism. Rigorously sustained
political difference? Extremism. Rigorously sustained cultural
difference? Barbarism. \"As a matter of fact, **this celebrated
\'other\' is acceptable only if ~~he~~ is a good other**---which is to
say what, exactly, if not the same as us]{.underline}?". [The only
acceptable difference is one that also merely \"accepts\" difference.
This restriction means that the **discourse of the other is effectively
a discourse of the Same**: a cosmopolitan fantasy of liberal-democratic,
free-market society: \"nothing other than the identity of a
wealthy---albeit visibly declining---\'West\']{.underline}\" (24).

**Legal extensions of the ethics of tolerance expand the legitimacy and
power of the state---for instance, the government simultaneously called
for tolerance of Muslim-Americans while using its power against them.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

For [tolerance discourse not only governs subjects, it not only quiets
potential civic conflict or social unrest, it also shores up the
legitimacy of the state and in so doing shores up and expands state
power]{.underline}. As we will see, [both state and nonstate deployments
of tolerance serve important strengthening and legitimating functions
for states suffering from weakened sovereignty occasioned by
globalization and crises of universalism related to exposed investments
in certain hegemonic powers, groups, and status categories]{.underline}.
Tolerance discourse will also turn out to be paradoxically important in
legitimating certain kinds of state violence. So here is the corrective
I would offer to Foucault\'s account: Although the state may be a minor
apparatus of governmentality, although it is itself governmentalized and
survives only to the degree that it 1s governmentalized, the state
remains the fulcrum of political legitimacy in late modern nations.8 But
political legitimacy, especially the political legitimacy of
institutions conferred by those subject to them, is not a matter in
which Foucault was much interested.9 And legitimacy is largely excluded
from his formulation of governmentality (though it does make an
appearance in his discussions of specifically neoliberal
governmentality).10 Yet even as governmentality captures both the
unboundedness of the state and the insufficiency of the state as a
signifier of how modern societies are governed, it fails to convey the
extent to which the state remains a unique and hence vulnerable object
of political accountability. If state legitimacy needs determine at
least some portion of political life, then this is a fact with which a
theory of the imperatives conditioning and organizing governance ought
to reckon - and Foucault\'s theory does not.11 We can think about this
another way: modern political power not only manages populations and
produces certain sorts of subjects, it also reproduces and enlarges
itself. Because such reproduction and enlargement at times fall among
political power\'s primary aims, they cannot be treated independently of
the project of governing populations and individuals. A full account of
governmentality, then, would attend not only to the production,
organization, and mobilization of subjects by a variety of powers but
also to the problem of legitimizing these operations by the singularly
accountable object in the field of political power: the state. These two
functions may be analytically separable, and at times they may appear at
cross purposes, but they do not occur separately in practice; an account
of contemporary governance therefore must capture both. This is not to
say that the state is the only source of governance, or even always the
most important one; but where it is involved (and this includes
privatization schemes in which the state\'s connection with the
enterprises to which it turns over certain functions is still visible),
the question of legitimacy is immediately at issue. In this vein, I will
be arguing that [the deployment of tolerance by the state is in part a
response to a legitimacy deficit and, in particular, to its historically
diminished capacity to embody universal representation. Tolerance
discourse masks the role of the state in reproducing the dominance of
certain groups and norms,]{.underline} and it does so at a historical
moment when popular sensitivity to this role and this dominance is high,
when those who have been historically excluded by norms of sex, race,
ethnicity, and religion are vocal about such exclusion. State tolerance
talk both softens and deflects these tensions. So[, for example, in the
context of the national security crisis precipitated by 9/11, the
American state not only guaranteed equality across ethnicity and
subnationality, it also expressly called for civic tolerance of what is
conjured as threatening Americans in the post-9/11 period]{.underline}:
\"Middle Eastern types\" in \"our\" midst. The state\'s guarantee of
equality expresses its powers to fulfill the social contract, while the
state\'s call for tolerance seeks to incite a modality of citizen
behavior that rejects stereotyping, prejudice, and above all
vigilantism. Yet at the same time that the state represents itself as
securing social equality and rhetorically enjoins the citizenry from
prejudice and persecution, the state engages in extralegal and
persecutorial actions toward the very group that it calls upon the
citizenry to be tolerant toward. [From roundups of illegal aliens by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service]{.underline} (now Immigration and
Customs Enforcement,-within the Department of Homeland Security) [to
detention and deportation of one ethnic subcategory of illegal residents
to racial profiling]{.underline} in airport security searches to police
and FBI interrogations that abrogate civil rights[, the state has busily
vilified and persecuted Arab Americans]{.underline} and Arab foreign
residents[, constituting them as potential threats to national
security]{.underline} and as a suspect, hence vulnerable and tenuous,
population[. These apparently Janus-faced actions are not mere hypocrisy
or subterfuge but are, rather, precisely what tolerance-as both a
subject-regulating and state-legitimating discourse-makes
possible.]{.underline}

**Their use of the law dooms their attempt at "hospitality"---including
others within the law re-enforces the superiority of the host.**

**Yegenoglu, 03** - professor of sociology at Middle East Technical
University, Ankara -- 2003 (Meyda, "Liberal Multiculturalism and the
Ethics of Hospitality in the Age of Globalization," PMC 13.2, Muse)

The question of hospitality in Kant\'s writings pulls us into the domain
of law, citizenship and the relation the state has with its subjects.
[Universal hospitality here is only juridical and political.
Cosmopolitan law is about international agreement and refers to the
condition of justice]{.underline} and law that is to be decided by
nations. Hospitality is treated as a question of rights, justice and
obligation that is to be regulated by
law.[4](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v013/13.2yegenoglu.html#foot4)
Resting on a juridical and political definition, the Kantian formulation
is based not on granting the right of residence but only the right of
temporary sojourn. [As a juridical regulation, it concerns the rights of
citizens of states that are to be regulated and deliberated by a
cosmopolitical constitution. As such, it suspends and conditions the
immediate, infinite, and unconditional welcoming of the
other]{.underline} (87). Derrida directs our attention to the fact that
[conditional hospitality is offered at the owner\'s]{.underline} place,
home[, nation]{.underline}, state, or city\--[that is, at a place where
one is defined as the master and where unconditional hospitality or
unconditional trespassing of the door is not possible.]{.underline} The
host, the non-guest, the one who accepts, the one who offers
hospitality, the one who welcomes, is the owner of a home and therefore
is the master of the
home.[5](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v013/13.2yegenoglu.html#foot5)
As I mentioned above, Derrida directs our attention to the fact that in
Kant\'s essay, [hospitality is framed as a question of law, an
obligation, a duty, and a right: it refers to the welcoming of an
alien/stranger other as a non-enemy. The formulation of hospitality as a
question of law weaves it with contradiction because the welcoming of
the other within the limits of law is possible on the condition that the
host, the owner of the home, the one who accepts, remains the master of
the home and thereby retains his/her authority in that
place]{.underline}.

**The acceptance of the Other treats them as add-ons to the existing
order and does not truly transform relationships.**

**Yegenoglu, 03** - professor of sociology at Middle East Technical
University, Ankara -- 2003 (Meyda, "Liberal Multiculturalism and the
Ethics of Hospitality in the Age of Globalization," PMC 13.2, Muse)

The increasing political presence of refugees and immigrants in
post-Cold war Europe has generated considerable debate about the nature
of multicultural society. [The demand for the recognition of cultural,
racial, and ethnic differences has come to occupy a central place
in]{.underline} the forms of [post-national politics]{.underline}
emergent today. [Yet, a closer examination of the juridico-political
regulations developed in response to these demands reveals a troubling
tendency: cultural/racial difference is translated into an understanding
of cultural diversity that treats minorities,]{.underline} to use David
Bennett\'s term[, as \"add-ons\" (5) to the existing nation form. Thus
the question becomes whether such an \"additive model\" (5) is capable
of inducing a radical transformation in the concept of the sovereign
position of the national self.]{.underline} This essay addresses the
limitations of this procedural multiculturalist valorization and argues
that [the liberal imperative to tolerate and respect cultural difference
is far from displacing the sovereignty of the host society in
question]{.underline}.

**NGOs carry out the political goals of the state. To the extent that
they promote humanitarian liberalism, they are promoting statist values,
even though they claim to operate outside of power.**

**Dillon & Reid, 2000** (Michael and Julian, Lecturer at the University
of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of
London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Humane Governance, Vol.
25 Ish. 1, January-March).

In sum, bipolarity once allowed subscription to the liberal distinctions
of civil/military, humanitarian/political, and
governmental/nongovernmental to effect a \"humanitarian\" position that
eschewed the political realism of the ideological conflict of the Cold
War. [Humanitarianism claimed then to be a space that was itself a kind
of zone of indistinction. That is to say, here relief was on offer
irrespective of religious, political, or other distinctions. The advent
of global liberal governance now represents the official propagation,
however, of such distinctions, together with their allied governmental
practices and institutions. These have become one of the principle means
by which global power currently circulates and operates. In doing so,
global liberal governance quite literally threatens nongovernmental and
humanitarian agencies with recruitment into the very structures and
practices of power against which they previously defined
themselves.]{.underline} Where once they practiced and enjoyed the space
afforded by the claim that they were without power\--specifically, power
politics\--it is evident now that they are not. [Major nongovernmental
humanitarian relief and development agencies are often also structured
more like and operate more like multinational corporations than
voluntary workers]{.underline}. Their spokesmen and women act and sound
like the senior international diplomats and policymakers that they are.
[As humanitarian NGOs increasingly devote themselves to the promotion of
liberal governmental policie]{.underline}s\--for example those of
transparency and accountability\--[they, too, have to meet penetrating
questions about the legitimacy, accountability, and transparency of
their own practices]{.underline}. Doing good, especially by insisting on
following the Hippocratic injunction to do no harm\--the classic
governmental maneuver of effecting power by denying one\'s own
politicality\--is a fiction now increasingly difficult to sustain in the
context of global liberal governance.

University, Human Rights as Geopolitics  Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form
of American Supremacy).

\"[To preach and announce the Gospel in the lands of the
barbarians]{.underline},\" Vitoria admonishes us, [is not just a right;
it is also a Christian duty]{.underline}. \"Brotherly correction is as
much part of natural law as brotherly love; and since all those peoples
are not merely in a state of sin, but presently in a state beyond
salvation, it is the business of Christians to correct and direct them.
Indeed, they are clearly obliged to do so\" (1991, 284). Though it is
wrong to convert the barbarians forcibly---here, as almost everywhere,
Vitoria follows Aquinas---it is right and just to force them to listen,
whether they accept the truth or not. Accordingly, [if the barbarians
obstruct or prevent the Spaniards in any way from exercising their
Christian]{.underline} duty to spread the truth[, then the Spaniards may
\"take up arms and declare war on them,]{.underline} insofar as this
provides the safety and opportunity needed to preach the Gospel.\" [They
may even \"**lawfully conquer** the territories of these
people]{.underline}, deposing their old masters and setting up new ones
and carrying out all the things which are lawfully permitted in other
just wars by the law of war, so long as they always observe reasonable
limits and do not go further than necessary\" (285-86). It was
Vitoria\'s sad and sincere belief that Spaniards had not observed
\"reasonable limits\" and had, in fact, \"gone beyond the permissible
bounds of justice and religion,\" but their excesses neither cancelled
their rights to use force when necessary nor vitiated the legal and
moral principles involved (286). [Christians had the right and the duty
to travel wherever they pleased, take the gold and other goods that they
found to be unused and unclaimed, and **preach their way of life, by
force if necessary, in order to bring the barbarians of the New World
out of their self-imposed immaturity** and into civic adulthood as full
members of the Christian community]{.underline}. Vitoria is careful to
specify that the barbarians of the Americas had nearly all of the same
rights as the Spaniards, for instance, the right to travel to Spain and
receive the full protection of Spanish law. But, for all of Vitoria\'s
concern with reciprocity---granting the Indians the same rights of
travel and trade---he cannot grant them equal rights when it comes to
religion. Here, as Schmitt is quick to point out, one finds Vitoria\'s,
and Christendom\'s, central and inescapable asymmetry. The ultimate
justification for the Spanish conquests lies in Christ\'s command to the
apostles to \"teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you \... even unto the end of the
world\" (Matthew 28:19-20). In more secular terms, the Church\'s
evangelical mission becomes Spain\'s \"civilizing\" mission, a mission
for which, perhaps because of his lingering Catholicism and his adamant
Eurocentrism, Schmitt cannot help but have some sympathy. It is worth
listening to what Schmitt has to say here at some length: However, that
the result \[of his investigations\] still leads in the Wnal analysis to
a justiWcation of the Spanish conquest lies in the fact that Vitoria\'s
objectivity and neutrality do indeed have their limits and in no \[End
Page 134\] way extend so far as to ignore or deny the distinction
between believing Christians and non-Christians. On the contrary: the
practical result is grounded completely in Vitoria\'s Christian
conviction, which Wnds its real justiWcation in the Christian mission.
That non-Christians could demand the same right of free propagation of
and intervention for their idolatry as the Christian Spaniards for their
Christian mission---that really does not occur to this Spanish monk.
Here, then, is the limit both of his absolute neutrality and his general
reciprocity and reversibility of concepts. Vitoria is perhaps an
Erasmist, but he is not representative of absolute humanity in the style
of the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries; he is no Voltarian and no
Rousseauist, no free thinker and no socialist\.... For Vitoria,
Christian Europe is still the center of the world, historically and
concretely located in Jerusalem and Rome. (1988, Der Nomos der Erde, 83,
84) Yes, this passage attests to the antiliberal prejudices of an
unregenerate Eurocentric conservative with a pronounced affect for the
counterrevolutionary and Catholic South of Europe. It seems to resonate
with the apologetic mid-twentieth-century Spanish reception of Vitoria
that wishes to justify the Spanish civilizing mission in the Americas.
[8](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT8)
But the contrast between Christianity and humanism is not just
prejudice; it is also instructive, because with it, Schmitt tries to
grasp something both disturbing and elusive about the modern
world---namely, the apparent fact that the liberal and humanitarian
attempt to construct a world of universal friendship produces, as if by
internal necessity, ever new enemies. For Schmitt, the Christianity of
Vitoria, of Salamanca, Spain, 1539, represents a concrete, spatially
imaginable order, centered (still) in Rome and, ultimately, Jerusalem.
This, with its divine revelations, its Greek philosophy, and its Roman
language and institutions, is the polis. This is civilization, and
outside its walls lie the barbarians. The humanism that Schmitt opposes
is, in his words, a philosophy of absolute humanity. By virtue of its
universality and abstract normativity, it has no localizable polis, no
clear distinction between what is inside and what is outside. Does
humanity embrace all humans? Are there no gates to the city and thus no
barbarians outside? If not, against whom or what does it wage its wars?
We can understand Schmitt\'s concerns in the following way:
[Christianity distinguishes between believers and
nonbelievers.]{.underline} Since nonbelievers can become believers, they
must be of the same category of being. [To be human,]{.underline} then,
[is the horizon within which the distinction between believers and
nonbelievers is made]{.underline}. That is, humanity per se is not part
of the distinction, but is that which makes the distinction possible.
[However, once the term used to describe the horizon of a distinction
also becomes that distinction\'s positive pole, it needs its negative
opposite. If humanity is both the horizon and the positive pole of the
distinction that that horizon enables, then the negative pole can only
be something that lies beyond that horizon, can only be something
completely antithetical to horizon and positive pole alike---**can only,
in other words, be inhuman**]{.underline}. As Schmitt says: [Only with
the concept of the human in the sense of absolute humanity does there
appear as the other side of this concept a specically new enemy, the
inhuman]{.underline}. In the history of the nineteenth century, setting
off the inhuman from the human is followed by an even deeper split, the
one between the superhuman and the subhuman. In the same way that the
human creates the inhuman, [so in the history of humanity the superhuman
brings about with a dialectical necessity the subhuman as its enemy
twin]{.underline}.[9](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT9)

[The Spanish conquest of the New World gave rise to two pressing and
interconnected questions: what type of humans]{.underline} (if humans
they were) [occupied this strange world, and what legal or moral
justification was there for Spanish dominion]{.underline} over them and
their possessions? [The answer to the first question, and thus
implicitly to the second, was simple,]{.underline} but needed further
specification[: **they were barbarians**]{.underline}. When the Greeks
coined the word, they used it to distinguish the foreign \"other\" from
themselves. If at first it merely meant the foreigner as such, by the
fourth century B.C. it marked the foreigner as inherently inferior. By
virtue of such an asymmetrical distinction between self and other, the
qualities of the self are simply assumed, unstated, and silently equated
with the norm, while the substandard properties of the other can be
endlessly enumerated. To be Greek was to be in an ethnically,
politically, culturally, and linguistically defined closed community.
All else was, and remained, outside, to be ignored or, if noticed, to be
dominated and used. [When the early Christian church took the term as
their own to distinguish between believers and nonbelievers, they
divested it of its ethnic, linguistic, and geographic substance, for all
humans]{.underline} had souls and all humans [had the potential of being
included in the Kingdom of Christ.]{.underline} That is, [the
distinction between the self and the other was no longer fixed, but
fluid; the other could give up its otherness and become part of the
larger and ever-expanding self---could, in a word,
assimilate]{.underline} itself to the dominant group. [Universalization,
however, has its price. All peoples,]{.underline} not just Greeks, could
now belong to an all-encompassing group, and by virtue of that
possibility all peoples [could be part of something called \"humanity,\"
but because Christians are in possession of the one and only
Truth]{.underline} and because inclusion is now based on the choice to
accept that one and only Truth, [to refuse to join was condemned as
moral perversity. One was offered a choice, but rather than a neutral
either/or, the alternatives were labeled \"right\" and \"wrong.\" Those
who lived in]{.underline} vincible [ignorance of
Christ]{.underline}---those, in other words, who had heard but rejected
the good news of the Gospel---[committed a mortal sin and would face
eternal damnation. **While still on earth, such infidels could also be
the targets of a \"just war,\" a \"crusade.\" Thus, though all peoples
are members of \"humanity,\" some---the nonbelievers---are lesser
members than others, possessing fewer rights and deserving
opprobrium**]{.underline}.

**Christianity demands cultural genocide of all those considered
barbarians.**

[The distinction between believer and nonbeliever is not a distinction
between tribe and tribe or nation and nation;]{.underline} it is not a
distinction between neighbor and foreigner or even one between finite
and localizable friends and enemies[. Rather, ideally, in the Christian
world, the negative pole of the distinction is to be fully and finally
consumed without remainder. The differences between]{.underline}
families, tribes[, nations, friends, and enemies are meant to
disappear.]{.underline} In the final analysis [there is no room for
opposition, neither within the City of God nor against it, and the
polis]{.underline}---call it Rome, call it Jerusalem---[will encompass
the entire world]{.underline}. That is precisely the purpose of its
civilizing power. What Schmitt calls humanism is but a more complete
universalization of the same dynamic.
[11](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT11)
Christianity and humanism are both civilizing missions. In neither case
can there be barbarians left outside the gates because eventually there
will be no outside of the gates and, thus, no more gates. [To live in
the city, **the barbarians must thoroughly give up their barbarian
ways---their customs, their religion, their language**. In the discourse
that equates the polis with humanity, to remain a barbarian is not to
remain outside the city, but to be included in the city as a moral and
legal outlaw and thus to come under the city\'s moral and legal
jurisdiction]{.underline}.

**The state cannot grant us freedoms---it can only make us into a

**Brown, 2000** (Wendy, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Princeton
University and UC Berkeley Humanities Fellow "Nietzsche for Politics" in
"Why Nietzsche Still?" Edited by Alan Schrift, pg. 218)

[This appreciation of- not simply hierarchy]{.underline}---as culturally
invigorating [emerges in Nietzsche\'s characterization of freedom as
\"the will to self-responsibility\" that \"preserves the distance which
divides us\"]{.underline} *(Tl* \"Skirmishes\" 3H). Thus, like Foucault,
[Nietzsche\'s complaint against modern politics is that it excessively
organizes and institutionalizes human relations: it dissolves our
separateness even as it fabricates us as \"individuals\"]{.underline};
it throws us into proximity in a fashion that mutes our own capacity to
express responsibility, creativity, and hence freedom, Like Rousseau,
[Nietzsche regards mass social intercourse and the institutions that
perpetuate it as the enemy of discerning sensibility. In this regard,
tolerance, one of democracy\'s proudest virtues, emerges as a symptom of
its baseness.]{.underline} To put up with men, to keep open house in
one\'s heart-this is liberal, but no more than liberal. One knows hearts
which are capable of *noble* hospitality, which have curtained windows
and closed shutters: they keep their best rooms empty \... because they
await guests with whom one does *not* have to \"put up.\" *(TI*
\"Skirmishes\" 25) In short, **[Nietzsche regards political life,
especially modern political life, as harboring values and spawning
institutions that displace and discourage individual and collective
aspiration, creativity, distinction, and culture. The state is
\"organized immorality,\" a \"tremendous machine\" that \"overpowers the
individual\" and substitutes for it a mechanical individualism in which
all are reduced to units]{.underline}** (WP 717,718). Parties arc for
unthinking followers-\"whoever thinks much is not suitable as a party
member: he soon thinks himself right through the party\" *(HH 579).* And
[political doctrines are mostly justifications of and for the weak
against the strong but also of the rational against the Dionysian, in
either case issuing from *ressentiment*]{.underline} *(Tl* \"Ancients\"

politics and culture when the former itself partakes of \"greatness\"
(Periclean Athens is the ambivalent example to which he frequently
recurs), politics is more often cast as the enemy of culture.

# impact: meaning to life

**Believing in truth with a capital T is a nihilist embrace of a false
version of reality. The only way to achieve meaningful existence is to
accept that violence and chaos are inevitable.**

**Scott---90** (Charles E., professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania
State University, "The Question of Ethics: Nietzsche, Foucault,
Heidegger," Ed. John Sallis, p. 173-174)

[One pathogenic aspect of our Western ethos that we have followed is the
ascetic ideal. It is characterized by many types of refusal and denial
regarding the manner in which human life occurs, and on Nietzsche\'s
account the ascetic ideal reinforces this denial with a habitual
insistence on the continuous presence of meaning in all dimensions of
life and being. In our ascetic withdrawal from life we join forces with
hopelessness, suffering, death, and helplessness by giving them meaning,
in our appropriation of them, that far exceeds their
occurrence]{.underline} and that subordinates them within a scheme of
meaning and hope. The rule governing the ascetic ideal is found in its
incorporation and blind expression of the hopelessness and
meaninglessness that it is designed to overcome. [This incorporation of
what it is constitutes the ideal\'s nihilism for Nietzsche: the
affirmations within the ascetic ideal project their opposites and
produce a spiral of unwitting and inevitable violence in the
spirituality that they create. The denial of life within the boundaries
of the ascetic ideal continuously reestablishes the power of the ideal.
But when this movement is broken by a self-overcoming]{.underline} like
that in Nietzsche\'s genealogy of the ascetic ideal, the rule of the
ascetic ideal is interrupted and [a possibility is opened for
life-affirmations that do not suppress the most fearful occurrences
involved in being alive.]{.underline} The joyousness of life without the
illusion of continuous meaning, the joyousness that Nietzsche found in
early Greek culture, was lost, according to his reading, in the course
of the increasing cultural dominance of those whose nerve has failed
before the disheartening flow of life. The ascetic ideal expresses this
failure in its insistence on meaning and in its persistent manufacture
of hope out of illusions bred of the failure. Heidegger is perhaps at
his most non-Nietzschean point when in his Rector\'s address he turns to
the Greek division between the everyday and the question of being. This
is an ironic moment in Heidegger\'s thought: he traces the origins of
his own move to separate the future of the German university from the
German Volkstum, (that is, from dominant popular culture) to the
emergence of the separation of thought from everyday life in Greek
culture. But this move is not associated with the joyousness that
Nietzsche uses as his reference in delimiting the ascetic ideal.
According to Nietzsche\'s genealogy we have lost an earthly affirmation
of life in the midst of the specific suffering of everyday existence.
Nietzsche countenances fully the brutality, the fateful shattering of
hope, the disappointments that break people\'s lives, the individual and
social tragedies. The debilitation of minds and bodies is juxtaposed to
people\'s savoring food and drink, enjoying sexual pleasure. It is
juxtaposed to friendship, the energy of ambition, the struggle between
competitors, the mixture of desperation and exhilaration in efforts of
accomplishment. [Nietzsche\'s move is toward affirmation in the midst of
chaotic living when he speaks of what is lost in the blind and
self-deceived chaos of asceticism that is ordered by the illusion of
continuous meaning. In this affirmation one has an
awareness]{.underline}, presumably a full awareness, [of the otherness
to human interest that radically distresses us]{.underline}. People\'s
attention is delimited by it. [Rather than escape or turn away from it,
people are delimited by it in their relations with things.]{.underline}
Rather than appropriate the suffering of life in ascetic self-denial,
human beings stand over against its otherness, its unthinkableness, its
density. They need not attempt to embody it in forms that seem to shape
it to human and thinkable dimensions. [They live in the inappropriable,
meaningless dark vacuity,]{.underline} with it and other to it, out of
it and in it. They are angel and animal, Nietzsche said. [Not to be
lost, not to be redeemed, not to be overcome, it is juxtaposed to a will
to live, an affirmation with, and not in spite of, the
chaos]{.underline}.

# impact: meaning to life

**Nietzsche's nihilism is life-affirming---he asks us to say "yes" to
the world as it is, giving meaning to our imperfect existence.**

**Dienstag, 2004** (Joshua Foe, PhD. in polsci from Princeton,
\"Tragedy, Pessimism, Nietzsche,\" New Literary History 34:1, Johns
Hopkins Literary Press, Project Muse)

Tragic art is the organization of a small portion of an otherwise
meaningless world that gives purpose to an individual existence (WP
585). It is the attempt to impose a temporary form on the inevitable
transformation of the world. Since the world must acquire some
particular forms in its metamorphoses, art is \"repeating in miniature,
as it were, the tendency of the whole\" (WP 617)-only now by an effort
of will. Thus, art is not really an attempt to fight the pattern of
existence, but rather to shape that pattern into something recognizable,
\"to realize in oneself the eternal joy of becoming-that joy which also
encompasses joy in destruction\" (TI 110). When art assumes this shape,
it becomes \"the great seduction to life, the great stimulant to life\"
(WP 853). This is not to say, however, that such art must be
\"uplifting\" in the conventional sense. Since joy in destruction may be
a stimulant to life, even depictions of the most miserable things may be
included: \"The things they display are ugly: but that they display them
comes from their pleasure in the ugly . . . How liberating is
Dostoevsky!\" (WP 821). If we can understand why an artist like
Dostoyevsky, who knows that art is devoid of metaphysical value, would
still want to write, then we can understand why [Nietzsche thinks
pessimism can result in a creative pathos]{.underline}. Similarly[, if
we can see how tragedy, the \"repetition in miniature\" of worldly
chaos, can represent the liberating \"joy of becoming,\" then we can get
a sense for the political productivity of a pessimistic
ethic.]{.underline} The normal situation of an architect, I think, helps
us to get some purchase on this: any sane architect must know that no
building lasts forever. Built in opposition to nature but using the
unstable materials of nature (as, to some extent, every human structure
must be), every edifice will be attacked by nature (by wind, by water,
by gravity, and so forth) the moment it is completed. Whatever the
purpose for which it is initially designed, that purpose will someday be
superseded. However beautiful it may seem when erected, it will someday,
to another set of eyes, appear ugly. Yet, knowing all this, architects
pursue their craft. Knowing that the universe will ultimately not
tolerate their work, they continue to organize a small portion of that
same universe for local purposes. The lack of an objective or
metaphysical meaning for the work is no obstacle; indeed, architects
often think of the generation of locally meaningful environments out of
natural waste to be a particular goal, a spur to activity. [Dionysian
pessimism]{.underline}, then, [is an ethos of a similar kind, an art of
living]{.underline}.22 In recommending it as a life-practice, [Nietzsche
is]{.underline}, in some sense, [thereby recommending the practice of
life]{.underline}. But since, as he was fond of pointing out, there is
really no perspective from which to view life as a whole (whether to
deny or affirm it), such an assent can only be a kind of gamble or
risk-taking. [It is an affirmation in the dark, an approval given in
ignorance. Above all, in keeping with the emphasis on the centrality of
temporal experience, it is a decision to welcome the unknown future and
accept the unseen past, rather than clinging to a familiar
present]{.underline}.23 While other [pessimisms]{.underline} (such as
Schopenhauer\'s) also [conclude that the universe has no order and human
history no progress, Dionysian pessimism is the one that can find
something to like about this situation: \"My new way to
\'yes.\']{.underline} My new version of [pessimism as a voluntary quest
for fearful and questionable aspects of beings. . . . A pessimist such
as that could in that way lead to a Dionysian yes-saying to the world as
it is: as a wish for its absolute return and eternity: with which a new
ideal of philosophy and sensibility would be given]{.underline}\" (KGW
8.2.121).

# impact: totalitarianism

**Democracy and privacy are not a check against totalitarianism; they
are [agents]{.underline} of excessive power---the tyranny of the
majority forces herd values onto the individual.**

**Warren, 88** (Mark, Professor of Political Science at the University
of British Colombia, [Nietzsche and Political Thought,]{.underline} pg.
220, MIT Press)

In these terms, one can understand Nietzsche\'s fear that the self might
be regressively politicized in the wake of the vacuum left by
Christian-moral culture. Although he implicitly shared this fear with
liberals, he did not see the possibility ofa resolution within the terms
of liberal theory. Here again Nietzsche\'s comments are suggestive:
[liberals have always opposed the encroachment of institutionalized
politics]{.underline} (if not institutionalized economics) [into the
\"private\" sphere of the self. They rightly fear totalitarianism in
such instances]{.underline}. But [liberals tend not to understand why
totalitarianism is possible]{.underline}, because [they do not
understand the historically conditional nature of individual
agency]{.underline}.25 They often make the fatal assumption that the
individual provides a natural and unassailable cornerstone of private
life, sustained by family, church, and work place. Yet [central aspects
of this system of identities dissolve in a cultural crisis]{.underline}.
[Nietzsche thought that for most the cultural crisis would lead to
exposure of a \"decadent\" self, the \"private person.\"]{.underline} 26
The \"private person\" coincides with what he later called the \"last
man.\" 27 The \"last man\" of the modern period is the result of a
political culture that had mediated power relations between individuals
through external identities, such as those of God and country. [With the
loss of external guidance in the modern cultural crisis, the last man\'s
feeling of power is threatened.]{.underline} God is replaced by new
kinds of religion, narcotic culture, and identity with national heroes
and the state[. The existence of \"last men\" leaves a fertile field for
invasion of the self by the state or any other institutionalized
power.]{.underline} Nietzsche\'s sensitivity to this weakness of liberal
democratic societies surely stemmed in part from the fact that liberal
culture was never well established in Germany. For this reason, he was
able to understand its contingent nature in ways that those in
well-established liberal cultures could not. Even in Nietzsche\'s
lifetime, processes of cultural breakdown coexisted with a rising German
nationalism, a nationalism expressed in the *Reich* and anti-Semitism.
Although [Nietzsche]{.underline} welcomed in principle the growth of
liberal institutions as a means for curbing state power, he [took little
comfort in their existence because he saw them as vehicles for the
ideals of an increasingly massified society]{.underline}.28 Thus,
reflecting the German situation of his time, Nietzsche emphasized not
the pluralism of parliamentary processes but their relative ideological
unity. [\"Parliamentarianism that is, public permission to choose
between five basic public opinions-flatters and wins the favor of all
those who would like to *seem* independent and individual, as if they
fought for their opinions\.... \"\"however deviates from the five public
opinions and stands apart will always have the whole herd against
him]{.underline}.\" 29 [\"Liberalism,\"]{.underline} Nietzsche writes
elsewhere, is [\"herd-animalization.\"]{.underline} 30The plausibility
of Nietzsche\'s polemics against the \"herd\" and its connections to
liberal institutions can be found in his view-one already well-developed
by de Tocqueville and John Stuart Millthat [parliamentary
processes]{.underline} contain the danger of [providing merely the
formal appearance of pluralism while functioning to legitimate the state
as a guarantor of mass values]{.underline}. [Should parliament become
the tool of the \"herd\"\--and Nietzsche thought this imminent-it would
surely use state power to impose \"herd\" values on
everyone.]{.underline} [\"]{.underline}Liberal institutions,\" he
generalizes, \"cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later
on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than
liberal institutions.\" 31 He voiced similar concerns about leftist
movements. Working at first through liberal institutions, the advocates
of democracy on the left would wish to politicize \"everything\" by
defining general standards of existence; they would dictate that
\"everyone should live and work according to such standards.\" 32
Foreshadowing the objections of later anarchists such as Emma Goldman
against statist Marxists, Nietzsche believed that revolutionaries harbor
a \"reactionary\" desire to reassert the power of the state over the
individua1.

# impact (security): survival 

**Imposing modernization comes at the cost of military
aggression---risking cultural and ecological survival.**

**Dillon & Reid, 2000** (Michael and Julian, Lecturer at the University
of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of
London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Humane Governance, Vol.
25 Ish. 1, January-March).

The disorder of emerging political complexes is of course fueled by
local factors. In a world that has always been more or less
interdependent, however, it would be grossly naive to think that local
factors were ever permanently or totally isolated historically from
global developments. Much less so now, then, in an age of virulent
globalization. [Global liberal governance is not, of course, a neutral
phenomenon, indifferent to local cultures,]{.underline} traditions, and
practices. Neither is it benignly disposed toward them**. [Rather, it
has always been virulently disruptive of them]{.underline}** [**and
aggressively related to them as much in moral as in economic and
military terms**. Much of the disorder that borders the domain of
liberal peace is clearly also a function,
therefore]{.underline}\--albeit a fiercely contested function\--[of its
very own normative]{.underline}, political, economic, and military
agendas, dynamics, and [practices]{.underline}, and of the
reverberations these excite throughout the world. [It seems increasingly
to be a function, specifically, of the way in which development is now
ideologically embraced by all of the diverse institutions of liberal
peace as an unrelenting project of modernization.]{.underline} The chief
economist of the World Bank (Joseph Stiglitz) attacks the Washington
Consensus on liberalization, stabilization, and privatization in the
world economy, for example, as too technical and too narrowly framed a
development strategy. He espouses instead a new intensive as well as
extensive policy committed to the unqualified and comprehensive
modernization and \"transformation of traditional societies.\"\[4\]
\"Honesty, however requires me to add one more word. In calling for a
transformation of societies, I have elided a central issue,\" Stiglitz
had the candor to conclude, \"transformation to what kind of society and
for what ends?\" [The impact of modernization on modern as well as
traditional societies is, of course, **as violent as the impact on
global resources and global ecology**. The values, practices, and
investments that propel such development nonetheless, however, are
precisely what protect it from pursuing the key question, locally as
well as globally, that Stiglitz posed in terms other than those that
underwrite his very problematization of it.]{.underline}

# Impact (security): war

**The West posits a culturally particular definition of what it means to
be human. This necessarily creates its opposite---the inhuman barbarian
that refuses the liberal order. Only abandoning the quest for a
universal humanity can stop escalating wars.**

**Rasch, 03** (Cultural Critique 54 (2003) 120-147, [William
Rasch](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#top)
is the Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana
University, Human Rights as Geopolitics  Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form
of American Supremacy).

For Schmitt, [to assume that one can derive morally correct political
institutions from abstract, universal norms is to put the cart before
the horse. The truly important question remains: who decides? What
political power representing which political order defines terms like
human rights and public reason, defines, in fact, what it means to be
properly human? What political power distinguishes]{.underline} between
the decent and the indecent, [between those who police the world and
those who are outlawed from it]{.underline}? Indeed, what political
power decides what is and what is not political? Habermas\'s contention
that normative legality neutralizes the moral and the political and that
therefore Schmitt \"suppresses\" the \"decisive point,\" namely, \"the
legal preconditions of an impartial judicial authority and a neutral
system of criminal punishment\" (1998, 200), is enough to make even an
incurable skeptic a bit nostalgic for the old Frankfurt School
distinction between affirmative and critical theory. One could observe,
for instance, that [the \"universality\" of human rights has a very
particular base.]{.underline} As Habermas says: Asiatic societies cannot
participate in capitalistic modernization without taking advantage of
the achievements of an individualistic legal order. One cannot desire
the one and reject the other. From the perspective of Asian countries,
the question is not whether human rights, as part of an individualistic
legal order, are compatible with the transmission of one\'s own culture.
Rather, the question is whether the traditional forms of political and
societal integration can be reasserted against---or must instead be
adapted to---the hard-to-resist imperatives of an economic modernization
that has won approval on the whole. (2001, 124) Thus, despite his
emphasis on procedure and the universality of his so-called discourse
principle, the choice that confronts Asiatic societies or any other
people is a choice between cultural identity and economic survival,
between, in other words, cultural and physical extermination. As Schmitt
said, the old Christian and civilizing distinction between believers and
nonbelievers (Gläubigern and Nicht-Gläubigern) has become the modern,
economic distinction between \"creditors and debtors\" (Gläubigern and
Schuldnern). But while affirmative theorists like Habermas and Rawls are
busy constructing the ideological scaffolding that supports the
structure of the status quo, what role is there for the \"critical\"
theorist to play? Despite the sanguine hopes of Hardt and Negri (2000)
that \"Empire\" will all but spontaneously combust as a result of the
irrepressible ur-desire of the multitude, can we seriously place our
faith in some utopian grand alternative anymore, or in some
revolutionary or therapeutic result based on the truth of critique that
would allow us all, in the end, to sing in the sunshine and laugh
everyday? Do, in fact, such utopian fantasies not lead to the moralizing
hubris of a Rawls or a Habermas?
[16](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT16)
In short, it is one thing to recognize the concealed, particular
interests that govern the discourse and politics of human rights and
quite another to think seriously about how things could be different, to
imagine an international system that respected both the equality and the
difference of states and/or peoples. Is it possible---and this is
Todorov\'s question---to value Vitoria\'s principle of the \"free
circulation of men, ideas, and goods\" and still also \"cherish another
principle, that of self-determination and noninterference\" (Todorov
1984, 177)? The entire \"Vitorian\" tradition, from Scott to Habermas
and Rawls, thinks not. Habermas, for instance, emphatically endorses the
fact that \"the erosion of the principle of nonintervention in recent
decades has been due primarily to the politics of human rights\" (1998,
147), a \"normative\" achievement that is not so incidentally correlated
with a positive, economic fact: \"In view of the subversive forces and
imperatives of the world market and of the increasing density of
worldwide networks of communication and commerce, the external
sovereignty of states, however it may be grounded, is by now in any case
an anachronism\" (150). And [opposition to this development is not
merely anachronistic; it is illegitimate, not to be tolerated. So, for
those who sincerely believe in American]{.underline} institutional,
cultural, and moral [superiority, the times could not be rosier. After
all, when push comes to shove, \"we\" decide---not only about which
societies are decent and which ones are not, but also about which acts
of violence are \"terrorist\" and which compose the \"gentle
compulsion\" of a \"just war.\" What, however, are those \"barbarians\"
who disagree with the new world order supposed to do]{.underline}? With
Agamben, they could wait for a \"completely new politics\" to come, but
the contours of such a politics are unknown and will remain unknown
until the time of its arrival. And that time, much like the second
coming of Christ, seems infinitely deferrable. While they wait for the
Benjaminian \"divine violence\" to sweep away the residual effects of
the demonic rule of law (Benjamin 1996, 248-52), the barbarians might be
tempted to entertain Schmitt\'s rather forlorn fantasy of an egalitarian
balance of power. Yet if the old, inner-European balance of power rested
on an asymmetrical exclusion of the non-European world, it must be
asked: what new exclusion will be necessary for a new balance, and is
that new exclusion tolerable? At the moment, there is no answer to \[End
Page 143\] this question, only a precondition to an answer. If one
wishes to entertain Todorov\'s challenge of thinking both equality and
difference, universal commerce of people and ideas as well as
self-determination and nonintervention, then the concept of humanity
must once again become the invisible and unsurpassable horizon of
discourse, not its positive pole[. The word \"human,\" to evoke one
final distinction, must once again become descriptive of a \"fact\" and
not a \"value.\" Otherwise, whatever else it may be, the search for
\"human\" rights will always also be the negative image of the
relentless search for the \"inhuman\" other]{.underline}.

# impact (ethics): war

**An ethic of tolerance achieves its opposite. Liberal societies
consider themselves tolerant insider states that are justified in waging
war on outsiders marked by intolerance.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

The original project, then, was to be a consideration of the
constructive and regulatory effects of tolerance as a discourse of
justice, citizenship, and community in late modern, multicultural
liberal democracies, with a focus on the United States. However, in the
aftermath of September 11, political rhetorics of [Islam, nationalism,
fundamentalism, culture, and civilization have reframed even domestic
discourses of tolerance-the enemy of tolerance is now the weaponized
radical Islamicist state or terror cell]{.underline} rather than the
neighborhood bigot-and have certainly changed the cultural pitch of
tolerance in the international sphere. [While some of these changes have
simply brought to the surface long-present subterranean norms in liberal
tolerance discourse, others have articulated tolerance for genuinely new
purposes. These include the legitimation of a new form of imperial state
action in the twenty-first century, a legitimation tethered to a
constructed opposition between a cosmopolitan West and its putatively
fundamentalist Other. Tolerance thus emerges as part of a civilizational
discourse that identifies both tolerance and the tolerable with the
West, marking nonliberal societies and practices as candidates for an
intolerable barbarism that is itself signaled by the putative
intolerance ruling these societies.]{.underline} In the mid-nineteenth
through midtwentieth centuries, the West imagined itself as standing for
civilization against primitivism, and in the cold war years for freedom
against tyranny; now these two recent histories are merged in the
warring figures of the free, the tolerant, and the civilized on one
side, and the fundamentalist, the intolerant, and the barbaric on the
other. As it altered certain emphases in liberal discourse itself, so,
too, did the post-September 11 era alter the originally intended course
of this study. The new era demanded that questions about tolerance as a
domestic governmentality producing and regulating ethnic, religious,
racial, and sexual subjects be supplemented with questions about the
operation of tolerance in and as a civilizational discourse
distinguishing Occident from Orient, liberal from nonliberal regimes,
\"free\" from \"unfree\" peoples. Such questions include the following:
If tolerance is a political principle used to mark an opposition between
liberal and fundamentalist orders, how might liberal tolerance discourse
function not only to anoint Western superiority but also to legitimate
Western cultural and political imperialism? That is, how might this
discourse actually promote Western supremacy and aggression even as it
veils them in the modest dress of tolerance? How might tolerance, the
very virtue that Samuel Huntington advocates for preempting a worldwide
clash of civilizations, operate as a key element in a civilizational
discourse that codifies the superiority and legitimates the
superordination of the West? What is the work of tolerance discourse in
a contemporary imperial liberal governmentality? What kind of subject is
thought to be capable of tolerance? What sort of rationality and
sociality is tolerance imagined to require and what sorts are thought to
inhibit it-in other words, what anthropological presuppositions does
liberal tolerance entail and circulate? In the end, the effort to
understand tolerance as a domestic discourse of ethnic, racial, and
sexual regulation, on the one hand, and as an international discourse of
Western supremacy and imperialism on the other, did not have to remain
permanently forked. Contemporary domestic and global discourses of
tolerance, while appearing at first blush to have relatively distinct
objects and aims, are increasingly melded in encomiums to tolerance,
such as those featured in the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance
discussed in chapter 4, and are also analytically interlinked. [The
conceit of secularism under girding the promulgation of tolerance within
multicultural liberal democracies not only legitimates their intolerance
of and aggression toward nonliberal states or transnational formations
but also glosses the ways in which certain cultures and religions are
marked in advance as ineligible for toleranc]{.underline}e while others
are so hegemonic as to not even register as cultures or religions; they
are instead labeled \"mainstream\" or simply \"American.\" In this way,
[tolerance discourse in the United States, while posing as both a
universal value and an impartial practice, designates certain beliefs
and practices as civilized and others as barbaric, both at home and
abroad; it operates from a conceit of neutrality]{.underline} that is
actually thick with bourgeois Protestant norms. The moral autonomy of
the individual at the heart of liberal tolerance discourse is also
critical in drawing the line between the tolerable and the intolerable,
both domestically and globally, and thereby serves to sneak liberalism
into a civilizational discourse that claims to be respectful of all
cultures and religions, many of which it would actually undermine by
\"liberalizing,\" and, conversely, to sneak civilizational discourse
into liberalism. This is not to say that tolerance in civilizational
discourse is reducible to liberalism; in fact, it is strongly shaped by
the legacy of the colonial settler native encounter as well as the
postcolonial encounter between white and indigenous, colonized, or
expropriated peoples. This strain in the lexicon and ethos of tolerance,
while not reducible to a liberal grammar and analytics, is nonetheless
mediated by them and also constitutes an element in the constitutive
outside of liberalism over the past three centuries [Tolerance is thus a
crucial analytic hinge between the constitution of abject domestic
subjects and barbarous global ones, between liberalism and the
justification of its imperial and colonial adventures.]{.underline} Put
slightly differently, tolerance as a mode of late modern governmentality
that iterates the normalcy of the powerful and the deviance of the
marginal responds to, links, and tames both unruly domestic identities
or affinities and nonliberal transnational forces that tacitly or
explicitly challenge the universal standing of liberal precepts[.
Tolerance regulates the presence of the Other both inside and outside
the liberal democratic nation-state, and often it forms a circuit
between them that legitimates the most illiberal actions of the state by
means of a term consummately associated with liberalism.]{.underline}

# impact (ethics): war

**The ethics of helping your neighbor are grounded in a spirit of
resentment---leading to inevitable warfare between opposing, dogmatic
civilizations.**

**Johnston, 99** (Ian, Research Associate and Instructor at Vancouver
Island University, \"There\'s Nothing Nietzsche Couldn\'t Teach Ya About
the Raising of the Wrist\" May,
<http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/nietzs.htm>)

Why is this insight so worrying? Well, one point is that [dogmatists get
aggressive]{.underline}. Soccer players and rugby players who forget
what Nietzsche is pointing out can start killing each other over
questions which admit of no answer, namely, questions about which group
has the true game, which group has privileged access to the truth.
Nietzsche senses that [dogmatism is going to lead to
warfare]{.underline}, and he predicts that [the]{.underline} twentieth
[century will see an unparalleled extension of warfare in the name of
competing dogmatic truths.]{.underline} Part of [his project is to wake
up the people who are intelligent enough to respond to what he\'s
talking about so that they can recognize the stupidity of killing each
other for an illusion which they mistake for some
\"truth.\"]{.underline} In addition to that, [Nietzsche]{.underline},
like Mill (although in a very different manner), [is seriously concerned
about the possibilities for human excellence in a culture where the herd
mentality is taking over]{.underline}, where Europe is developing into
competing herds\--a situation which is either sweeping up the best and
the brightest or is stifling them entirely. Nietzsche, like Mill and the
ancient pre-Socratic Greeks to whom he constantly refers, is an elitist.
[He wants the potential for individual human excellence to be liberated
from the harnesses of conformity and group competition and conventional
morality. Otherwise, human beings are going to become destructive, lazy,
conforming herd animals, using technology to divert them from the
greatest joys in life,]{.underline} which come only from individual
striving and creativity, activities which require one to release one\'s
instincts without keeping them eternally subjugated to an overpowering
historical consciousness or a conventional morality of good and evil.
[What makes this particularly a problem for Nietzsche is that he sees
that a certain form of game is gaining popularity: democratic
volleyball. In this game, the rule book insists that all players be
treated equally, that there be no natural authority given to the best
players or to those who best understand the nature of quality
play.]{.underline} Hence the mass of inferior players is taking over,
the quality of the play is deteriorating, and there are fewer and fewer
good volleyball players. [This process is being encouraged]{.underline}
both [by the traditional ethic of \"help your neighbour]{.underline}\"
(now often in a socialist uniform) and (as mentioned above) by modern
science).  [As the mass of]{.underline} more [numerous inferior
players]{.underline} [takes over the sport, the mindless violence of
their desires to attack other players and take over their games
increases, as does their hostility to those who are uniquely
excellent]{.underline} (who may well need a mask to prevent themselves
being recognized). The hopes for any change in this development are not
good. In fact, things seem to be getting worse. For when Nietzsche looks
at all these games going on he notices certain groups of people, and the
prospect is not totally reassuring.

# impact (ethics): meaning to life

**Their call to love thy neighbor is an assertion of the need to absorb
difference in order to create a secure order. Only the affirmation of
difference and an acceptance of fear can lead to a meaningful
existence.**

**Der Derian,** **98** - Director of Watson Institute Global Security
program -- 1998 (James, former Rhodes Scholar, [On
Security]{.underline}, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche,
and Baudrillard," ed. Ronnie Lipschutz. ciaonet)

[The establishment of the community is dependent upon, indeed it feeds
upon, this fear of being left outside.]{.underline} As the castle wall
is replaced by written treaty, however, and distant gods by temporal
sovereigns, the martial skills and spiritual virtues of the noble
warrior are slowly debased and dissimulated. [**The subject of the
individual will to power becomes the object of a collective resentment.
The result? The fear of the external other is transvalued into the
\"love of the neighbor**\"]{.underline} quoted in the opening of this
section[, and the perpetuation of community is assured through the
internalization and legitimation of a fear that lost its original source
long ago.]{.underline} [This powerful nexus of fear, of external and
internal otherness, generates the values which uphold the security
imperative.]{.underline} Indeed, Nietzsche locates the genealogy of even
individual rights, such as freedom, in the calculus of maintaining
security: - My rights - are that part of my power which others not
merely conceded me, but which they wish me to preserve. How do these
others arrive at that? First: through their prudence and fear and
caution: whether in that they expect something similar from us in return
(protection of their rights); or in that they consider that a struggle
with us would be perilous or to no purpose; or in that they see in any
diminution of our force a disadvantage to themselves, since we would
then be unsuited to forming an alliance with them in opposition to a
hostile third power. Then : by donation and cession.
[45](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note45) The
point of Nietzsche\'s critical genealogy is to show that the perilous
conditions that created the security imperative\--and the western
metaphysics that perpetuate it\--have diminished if not disappeared;
yet, the fear of life persists: \"Our century denies this perilousness,
and does so with a good conscience: and yet it continues to drag along
with it the old habits of Christian security, Christian enjoyment,
recreation and evaluation.\"
[46](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note46)
[Nietzsche\'s worry is that the collective reaction against older, more
primal fears has created an even worse danger: the tyranny of the
herd,]{.underline} the lowering of man, the apathy of the last man which
controls through conformity and rules through passivity[. The security
of the sovereign, rational self and state comes at the cost of
ambiguity, uncertainty, paradox\--all that makes a free life worthwhile.
Nietzsche\'s lament for this lost life is captured at the end of
Daybreak  in a series of rhetorical questions:]{.underline} Of future
virtues\--How comes it that the more comprehensible the world has grown
the more solemnities of every kind have decreased? [Is it that fear was
so much the basic element of that reverence which overcame us in the
presence of everything unknown and mysterious and taught us to fall down
before the incomprehensible and plead for mercy? And has the world not
lost some of its charm for us because we have grown less
fearful?]{.underline} With the diminution of our fearfulness has our own
dignity and solemnity, our own fearsomeness , not also diminished?
[47](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note47) It
is of course in Nietzsche\'s lament, in his deepest pessimism for the
last man, that one finds the celebration of the overman as both symptom
and harbinger of a more free-spirited yet fearsome age. Dismissive of
utopian engineering, Nietzsche never suggests how he would restructure
society; he looks forward only so far as to sight the emergence of \"new
philosophers\" (such as himself?) who would restore a reverence for fear
and reevaluate the security imperative. Nietzsche does, however, go back
to a pre-Christian, pre-Socratic era to find the exemplars for a new
kind of security. In The Genealogy of Morals , he holds up Pericles as
an example, for lauding the Athenians for their \"rhathymia \"\--a term
that incorporates the notion of \"indifference to and contempt for
security.\"
[48](http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html#note48) It
is perhaps too much to expect Nietzsche\'s message to resonate in late
modern times, to expect, at the very time when conditions seem most
uncertain and unpredictable, that people would treat fear as a stimulus
for improvement rather than cause for retrenchment. Yet [Nietzsche would
clearly see these as opportune times, when fear could be willfully
asserted as a force for the affirmation of difference, rather than
canalized into a cautious identity constructed from the calculation of
risks and benefits.]{.underline}

# impact (ethics): dehumanization

**The notion of acting to save the stranger takes otherness as natural
and relies upon the categories of us/them. This reduces subjects of
protection to dehumanized subjects---lives to be saved, but stripped of
political agency.**

**Edkins, 03 (**Jenny, International politics, University of Wales,
Journal of Human Rights, v.2 n.2, June).

[The debate broadly centers on establishing normative principles that
help us decide at what point we should intervene to help
strangers.]{.underline} What are our responsibilities towards those who
are not fellow citizens? Should we take action to help them when to do
so would mean intervening in the affairs of  another sovereign state?
How should we do this so as to avoid inadvertently doing harm? These
questions take for granted that the people we are concerned to help are
what we call 'strangers'. The assumption is that 'we' and 'they' are
already distinct, before there is any relationship between us. The only
question to be resolved is whether and how 'we' should help 'them' --
and it is not seen as problematic to look for general, ahistorical rules
that will provide solutions to those questions. [The sovereign state
system under which we live is one that is based on and produced by such
distinctions: between domestic and foreign, inside and outside, us and
them]{.underline}, here and there (Walker 1993). [To take for granted
these distinctions is already to frame the whole debate in a way that
leads inexorably towards a solution supportive of  state
sovereignty]{.underline}. [This is why, far from challenging state
sovereignty, humanitarianism often reinforces it]{.underline} (Campbell
1997). And I want to suggest that this is the reason too why an increase
in talk of  normative criteria and the moral  basis  of 
 humanitarianism  is  accompanied  so  closely  by  the  incorporation
 of   the independent humanitarian movement in practices of  governance:
whether those of  indi- vidual states or those of  the interstate
community is largely immaterial. Does this mean that all forms of 
humanitarianism will in the end succumb to incorporation by the state?
Is it possible to envisage a humanitarianism that restores the concept
of  neutrality and re-establishes an 'autonomous humanitarian space'
distinct from state politics, as Rieff  suggests (Rieff  2002: 328)? To
address this question we need to examine closely what Rieff  has in mind
here. The success of  the enterprise may well depend on the extent to
which it can move away from the assumptions underlying contemporary
humanitarianism identified above and develop an approach that does not
rely on the constitution of  the subjects of  its concern in a way that
so closely imitates the production of  subjects of the state. The
concepts of  neutrality and impartiality are often seen as part of  an
attempt to render  humanitarianism  apolitical.  As  a  result  of   the
 experience  of   'actually-existing humanitarianism' over the past
twenty-five years, it is now generally accepted that humanitarian action
cannot be separated from politics in the broad sense: it has political
consequences.  Rieff   does  not  dispute  this,  and  when  he  argues
 for  a  return  to  a  neutral, independent humanitarianism, I take it
he means a humanitarianism that is not closely linked to the politics
of  the state rather than one that is apolitical. What are the
implications of  the call for a neutrality of  this sort? Is it
possible? Can humanitarianism return to its 'core values -- solidarity,
a fundamental sympathy for victims, and an antipathy for oppressors and
exploiters' (Rieff  2002: 334)? Neutrality can be read in different
ways, some more conducive to state humanitarianism and others to the
independent humanitarianism Rieff  advocates. The concept of neutrality
can be seen as drawing on some notion of  common humanity -- a form of 
lowest common denominator that all human beings possess and to which
humanitarians respond. The human rights discourse relies on a similar
concept of  a basic humanity to which rights are attached. This approach
is problematic, however. As Rieff  points out, it emphasizes the
innocence of  victims. Images of  children are particularly potent in
this discourse because of  their guaranteed 'innocence'.[Those that
humanitarianism helps are 'human beings in the generic sense', in a tale
'devoid of  historical context]{.underline}, geographical specificity'
and 'any real personalization' (Rieff  2002: 35). In other words they
are treated as lives to be saved, lives with no political voice, or what
Giorgio Agamben calls 'bare life' (Agamben 1998). This notion of  bare
humanity risks complicity with state forms -- in the same way as the
us/them distinction discussed above. [Both the sovereign state and a
humanitarianism based on the concept of  a common human essence produce
(and depend on) a particular form of  subject: one that is excluded from
politics. The  narrative  of  human  being  as  a  common  essence
 risks  the  same  exclusionary practices that produce the sovereignty
of  the nation-state]{.underline}, with its narratives of  national
identity[, and produces the same dehumanized and depoliticized
subjects.]{.underline}

# impact (ethics): turns case

**Ethics of acceptance end up displacing more important substantive
political solutions, making conflicts worse.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

[The retreat from more substantive visions of justice heralded by the
promulgation of tolerance today is part of a more general
depoliticization of citizenship and power and retreat from political
life itself. The cultivation of tolerance as a political end implicitly
constitutes a rejection of politics as a domain in which conflict can be
productively articulated and addressed, a domain in which citizens can
be transformed by their participation, a domain in which differences are
understood as created and negotiated politically, indeed a domain in
which "difference" makes up much of the subject matter.]{.underline} To
the contrary, as it casts the political and the social as places where
individuals with fixed identities, interests, and ideas chafe and
bargain, tolerance discourse attempts to remove from the political table
as much of our putatively "natural" enmity as it can. This formulation
undercuts the cultivation both of shared citizen power and of a
substantive public sphere devoted to the fashioning of democratic
political culture and community. Moreover, [the retreat from a political
encounter with difference exacerbates the problem imagined to occasion
it. The thinner that public life and citizens' experience with power and
difference grows, the more citizens withdraw into private identities and
a perception of fellow citizens as tools or obstacles to their private
aims, and the more we appear in need of tolerance as a solution to our
differences- a solution that intensifies our estrangements from one
another and from public life as a filed of engagement with
difference]{.underline}.

**The ethical call for tolerance and acceptance of the other is
depoliticizing---emotional appeals replace serious investigation of the
conditions that produced injustice in the first place.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

Again, if [tolerance is never innocent of power]{.underline} or
normativity, this serves only to locate it solidly in the realm of the
human and hence make it inappropriate for conceptualizations of morality
and virtue that fancy themselves independent of power and subjection. Of
itself, however, this revaluation does not yet indicate what the
specifically political problematics of tolerance are. These are set not
by the presence of power in the exercise of tolerance but, rather, by
the historical, social, and cultural particulars of this presence in
specific deployments of tolerance as well as in discourses with which
tolerance intersects, including those of equality, freedom, culture,
enfranchisement, and Western civilization. Tolerance as such is not the
problem. Rather, [the call for tolerance, the invocation of tolerance,
and the attempt to instantiate tolerance are all signs of identity
production and identity management in the context of orders of
stratification or marginalization in which the production, the
management, and the context themselves are disavowed. In short, they are
signs of a buried order of politics]{.underline}. Part of the project of
this book, then, is to analyze tolerance, especially in its recently
resurgent form, as a strand of depoliticization in liberal democracies.
Depoliticization involves construing inequality, subordination,
marginalization, and social conflict, which all require political
analysis and political solutions, as personal and individual, on the one
hand, or as natural, religious, or cultural on the other. Tolerance
works along both vectors of depoliticization-it personalizes and it
naturalizes or culturalizes-and sometimes it intertwines them. Tolerance
as it is commonly used today tends to cast instances of inequality or
social injury as matters of individual or group prejudice. And it tends
to cast group conflict as rooted in ontologically natural hostility
toward essentialized religious, ethnic, or cultural difference. That is,
tolerance discourse reduces conflict to an inherent friction among
identities and makes religious, ethnic, and cultural difference itself
an inherent site of conflict, one that calls for and is attenuated by
the practice of tolerance. As I will suggest momentarily, tolerance is
hardly the cause of the naturalization of political conflict and the
ontologization of politically produced identity in liberal democracies,
but it is facilitated by and abets these processes. Although
depoliticization sometimes personalizes, sometimes culturalizes, and
sometimes naturalizes conflict, these tactical variations are tethered
to a common mechanics, which is what makes it possible to speak of
depoliticization as a coherent phenomenon.13 Depoliticization involves
removing a political phenomenon from comprehension of its historical
emergence and from a recognition of the powers that produce and contour
it. No matter its particular form and mechanics, depoliticization always
eschews power and history in the representation of its subject. When
these two constitutive sources of social relations and political
conflict are elided, an ontological naturalness or essentialism almost
inevitably takes up residence in our understandings and explanations. In
the case at hand, an object of tolerance analytically divested of
constitution by history and power is identified as naturally and
essentially different from the tolerating subject; in this difference,
it appears as a natural provocation to that which tolerates it.
Moreover, not merely the parties to tolerance but the very scene of
tolerance is naturalized, ontologized in its constitution as produced by
the problem of difference itself. When, for example, middle and high
schoolers are urged to tolerate one another\'s race, ethnicity, culture,
religion, or sexual orientation, there is no suggestion that the
differences at issue, or the identities through which these differences
are negotiated, have been socially and historically constituted and are
themselves the effect of power and hegemonic norms, or even of certain
discourses about race, ethnicity, sexuality, and culture. Rather,
difference itself is what students learn they must tolerate. [In
addition to depoliticization as a mode of dispossessing the constitutive
histories and powers organizing contemporary problems and contemporary
political subjects-that is, depoliticization of sources of political
problems-there is a second and related meaning of
depoliticization]{.underline} with which this book is concerned: namely,
[that which substitutes emotional and personal vocabularies for
political ones in formulating solutions to political problems. When the
ideal or practice of tolerance is substituted for justice or equality,
when sensitivity to or even respect for the other is substituted for
justice for the other,]{.underline} when historically induced suffering
is reduced to \"difference\" or to a me- indium of \"offense,\" when
suffering as such is reduced to a problem of personal feeling, [then the
field of political battle and political transformation is replaced with
an agenda of behavioral, attitudinal, and emotional practices. While
such practices often have their value, substituting a tolerant attitude
or ethos for political redress of inequality or violent exclusions not
only reifies politically produced differences but reduces political
action and justice projects to sensitivity training]{.underline}, or
what Richard Rorty has called an \"improvement in manners.\"l5 A justice
project is replaced with a therapeutic or behavioral one.

# impact (rights) = extermination

**Human rights justify wars of extermination. Once the enemy is labeled
as an enemy of abstract concepts, such as "freedom", they cease to be
fully human and are targeted for annihilation.**

**Odysseos---04** (Louiza, Ph.D, Professor of Politics and International
Studies at the University of London, "*Über Die Linie*? Carl Schmitt and
Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on
Terror," September, p. 19-21)

Finally and most importantly, [there is the relation of the concept of
humanity to the other, and to war and violence]{.underline}. In its
historical location, the humanity concept had critical purchase against
aristocratic prerogatives, but its utilization by [liberal
discourses]{.underline} in the individualist tradition, Schmitt feared,
[could bring about new and unimaginable modes of exclusion]{.underline}.
Rasch explains: [The humanism that Schmitt opposes is, in his words, a
philosophy of absolute humanity. By virtue of its universality and
abstract normativity, it has no localizable polis, no clear distinction
between what is inside and what is outside. Does humanity embrace all
humans? Are there no gates to the city and thus no barbarians outside?
If not, against whom or what does it wage its wars?]{.underline}
'Humanity as such' Schmitt noted 'cannot wage war because it has no
enemy, at least not on this planet'. As Ellen Kennedy notes, [humanity
'is a polemical word that negates its opposite]{.underline}.' In *The
Concept of the Political* Schmitt argued that [humanity 'excludes the
concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human
being']{.underline}. In the *Nomos*, however, it becomes apparent that,
historically examined, the concept of humanity could not allow the
notion of *justis hostis*, of a 'just enemy', who is recognized as
someone with whom one can make war but also negotiate peace. Schmitt
noted how [only when '~~man~~ appeared to be the embodiment of absolute
humanity, did the other side of this concept appear in the form of a new
enemy: the inhuman']{.underline} (NE 104). It is worth quoting Rasch's
account at length: We can understand Schmitt's concerns in the following
way: Christianity distinguishes between believers and nonbelievers.
Since nonbelievers can become believers, the must be of the same
category of being. To be human, then, is the horizon within which the
distinction between believers and nonbelievers is made. That is,
humanity per se is not part of the distinction, but is that which makes
the distinction possible. However, once the term used to describe the
horizon of a distinction also becomes that distinction's positive pole,
it needs its negative opposite. [If humanity is both the horizon and the
positive pole of the distinction that that horizon enables, then the
negative pole can only be something that lies beyond that horizon, can
only be something completely antithetical to horizon and positive pole
alike--- can only, in other words, be inhuman. Without the concept of
the just enemy associated with the notion of nondiscriminatory war, the
enemy had no value and could be exterminated]{.underline}. The concept
of humanity, furthermore, reintroduces substantive causes of war because
it shutters the formal concept of *justis hostis*, now designated
substantively as an enemy of humanity as such. In Schmitt's account of
the League of Nations in the *Nomos*, he highlights that compared to the
kinds of [wars that can be waged on behalf of humanity the Interstate
European wars from 1815 to 1914 in reality were regulate; they were
bracketed by the neutral Great Powers and were completely legal
procedures in comparison with the modern and gratuitous police actions
against violatiors of peace, which can be dreadful acts of
annihilation]{.underline} (NE 186). Enemies of humanity cannot be
considered 'just and equal' enemies. Moreover, they cannot claim
neutrality: [one cannot remain neutral in the call to be for or against
humanity or its freedom]{.underline}; one cannot, similarly, claim a
right to resist or defend oneself in the sense we understand this right
to have existed in the *jus publicum Europeaum*. As will examine below
in the context of the war on terror, [this denial of the self-defense
and resistance 'can presage a dreadful nihilistic destruction of all
law']{.underline} (NE 187).

# impact (rights) = extermination

**Human rights stands in cooperation with conservative power---all those
who oppose rights are labeled as terrorists to be exterminated.**

**Meister 02** \[Robert, Professor of Philosophy @ UC Santa Cruz, "Human
Rights and the Politics of Victimhood," Ethics & International Affairs,
Vol. 16, Iss. 2, pg. 91, proquest\]

[The political effect of recent Human Rights Discourse is to marginalize
as \"terrorists\"]{.underline} those on both sides of the old conflict
[who are still willing to fight on. Terrorism-the remnant of
twentieth-century \"inhumanity\"-is now the phenomenon against which all
civilized nations in the twenty-first century can agree to make \"war.\"
The main point,]{.underline} today, [of calling a movement or regime
\"terrorist\" is to drain it of its]{.underline} twentieth-century
[political]{.underline} content and context. Indeed, struggles for
political and/or cultural autonomy that might recently have claimed the
mantle of human rights are now described (looking forward) as morally
equivalent to crimes against humanity insofar as they engage in acts of
\"terror\" or are hesitant in condemning terrorism elsewhere. In its new
proximity to power, [the]{.underline} mainstream [human rights
establishment speaks with increasing hostility toward movements that it
might once have sought to comprehend.]{.underline} As we begin this new
century, [Human Rights Discourse is in danger of devolving from an
aspirational ideal to an implicit]{.underline} compromise that allows
the victims of past injustice a moral victory on the understanding that
the ongoing beneficiaries get to keep their gains without fear of
terrorism. [The movement aims, of course, to persuade the passive
supporters of the old order to abjure illegitimate means of
counterrevolutionary politics-the repressive and fraudulent techniques
of power that they once condoned or ignored]{.underline}. Insofar as the
aim is also to reconcile these passive supporters (including many
beneficiaries) with the victims of past injustice, it nevertheless
advances the counterrevolutionary project by other means. The new
culture of respect for human rights would, thus, reassure the
beneficiary that the (former) victim no longer poses this threat, and
maybe never did. For the victim who was morally undamaged and/or
subsequently \"healed,\" the past would be truly over once its horrors
were acknowledged by national consensus. This sought-after consensus on
the moral meaning of the past comes at the expense, however, of cutting
off future claims that would normally seem to follow from it. To put the
point crudely, the cost of achieving a moral consensus that the past was
evil is to reach a political consensus that the evil is past. [In
practice, this political consensus operates to constrain debate in
societies that regard themselves as \"recovering\" from horrible
histories]{.underline}. It means that unreconciled victims who continue
to demand redistribution at the expense of beneficiaries will be accused
of undermining the consensus that the evil is past; it also means that
continuing beneficiaries who act on their fears that victims are still
unreconciled will be accused of undermining the consensus that the past
was evil by \"blaming the victim.\' Indeed, the substantive meaning of
evil itself has changed in the human rights culture that is widely
believed to have superseded the Cold War. \"Evil\" is no longer widely
understood to be a system of social injustice that can have ongoing
structural effects, even after the structure is dismantled. Rather, evil
is described as a time that is past-or can be put in the past. The
present way that born-again adherents to human rights address surviving
victims of past evil is to project a distinction between the \"good\"
(undamaged) and \"bad\" (unreconciled or recalcitrant) members of the
victimized groups. [To the extent that the emergent human rights project
aims to enlist the support of the good victims in repressing the bad
victims as terrorists]{.underline} (and/or criminals, depending on the
type of judicial process they will receive), [it is, prima facie, a
continuation, by other means, of the twentieth-century project of
counterrevolution]{.underline}.

# impact (rights) = extermination

**The politics of human rights justifies massive violence---the powerful
can wage wars against the inhuman masses laying outside the circle of
rights holders.**

**Meister 02** \[Robert, Professor of Philosophy @ UC Santa Cruz, "Human
Rights and the Politics of Victimhood," Ethics & International Affairs,
Vol. 16, Iss. 2, pg. 91, proquest\]

[The anti-messianic message of the Human Rights Discourse
is]{.underline} not entirely the program of peace and reconciliation
that it might seem to be on the surface. It is, also, [a declaration of
war against a new enemy]{.underline}. Carl Schmitt first pointed this
out in his criticism of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, outlawing war.
\"The solemn declaration of outlawing war,\" he asserted, \"does not
abolish the friend-enemy distinction, but, on the contrary, opens new
possibilities by giving an international hostis declaration new content
and new vigor.\"30 This criticism applied equally, in Schmitt\'s view,
to the human rights consensus expressed by the Treaty of Versailles, in
1919, which established the League of Nations: [When a state fights its
political enemy in the name of humanity it\...seeks to usurp a universal
concept against its military opponent \... in the same way that one can
misuse peace, justice, progress, and civilization in order to claim
these as one\'s own and to deny the same to the enemy.]{.underline}
Although Schmitt\'s own political agenda, which led to a defense of
Nazism, is ultimately despicable, he nevertheless provides a helpful
guide to the ideological significance of Human Rights Discourse at a
moment of U.S. military and economic hegemony at the end of the Cold
War. This move is, as he well understood, a way to create new political
alliances by shifting enemies. The underlying intent of such an
international consensus to protect human rights is not to assert a
selfconfident universality, but rather to represent what Schmitt called
\"a potential or actual alliance, that is, a coalition.\"32 In the
present conjuncture, he is worth quoting at length on this point: It
is\...erroneous to believe that a political position founded on economic
superiority is \"essentially unwarlike\"\... \[It\] will naturally
attempt to sustain a worldwide condition which enables it to apply and
manage, unmolested, its economic means, e.g., terminating credit,
embargoing raw materials, destroying the currencies of others, and so
on. Every attempt of a people to withdraw itself from the effects of
such \"peaceful methods\" is considered by this imperialism as
extraeconomic power\.... Modern means of annihilation have been produced
by enormous investments of capital and intelligence, surely to be used
if necessary.33 Schmitt anticipated [the rhetorical demands that Human
Rights Discourse would place on liberal politicians still fighting, as
Woodrow Wilson did, \"to make the world safe for democracy\"-but now in
the name of a \"world community\" defending \"humanity\" as
such]{.underline}. As he explains: For the application of such means, a
new and essentially pacifist vocabulary has been created. War is
condemned but executions, sanctions, punitive expeditions,
pacifications, protection of treaties, international police, and
measures to assure peace remain. [The adversary is thus no longer called
an enemy but a disturber of peace and is thereby designated to be an
outlaw of humanity]{.underline}\.... But this allegedly
non-political\... system cannot escape the logic of the political.34
Schmitt\'s analysis, above, might be read today as a forecast: Although
we are now able to fight wars only on the condition that they are not
described as such, these wars do not thereby \"escape the logic of the
political.\" Schmitt\'s powerful critique of the depoliticizing project
of what was, in his time, the precursor to Human Rights Discourse went
some way toward repoliticizing it, at least in Weimar Germany. Perhaps
because of his own dalliance in the politics of victimhood in its most
pernicious form, Schmitt did not fully understand a deeper implication
of his own argument: that adopting a [Human Rights Discourse gives
survivors of past barbarity the consciousness of victims. It is they,
the newly vulnerable, who must now be protected from being violated by
the \"inhuman.\" \"Whoever invokes humanity wants to
cheat;\']{.underline} Schmitt says. [\"To\... invoke and monopolize such
a term probably has certain incalculable effects, such as denying the
enemy the quality of being human and declaring him to be an outlaw of
humanity; and a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme
inhumanity.]{.underline}\"35

# alt solves: realism

**Nietzsche is compatible with realism---it is the 1ACs quest for
democracy and universal rights that is idealist.**

**Der Derian 03** (Political Science Professor, University of
Massachusetts
<http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/boundary/v030/30.3derian.html>
boundary 2 30.3 (2003) 19-27, Decoding The National Security Strategy of
the United States of America, James).

[What significance should we make of the fact that the shortest section
of the *NSS*]{.underline} (barely a page and a half) [is on the
\"nonnegotiable demands of human dignity\" and rights, including \"free
speech; freedom of worship; equal justice;]{.underline} respect for
women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private
property\" (3[). Are these rights so self-evident and inalienable that
they do not warrant further clarification or justificatio]{.underline}n?
It would seem so: \"History has not been kind to those nations which
ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people\" (3). And
yet this universalist avowal of rights requires a selective if not
outright denial of history. Where was the U.S. support of freedom,
justice, and religious and ethnic tolerance when it supported Saddam
Hussein in his earlier war against Iran? When it provided intelligence,
arms, and the precursors for chemical weapons of mass destruction? When
it abandoned the Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north of Iraq
after the first Gulf War? Most significant is that these rights are
considered \"nonnegotiable,\" making war, if not the first, certainly
more of a viable option when these rights are violated. In this regard,
President Bush\'s *NSS* is a continuation rather than a repudiation of
President Clinton\'s *National Security Strategy of the United States
1994--1995: Engagement and Enlargement*. To be sure, Clinton\'s
*National Security Strategy* places greater emphasis on \"preventive
diplomacy\" and multilateral intervention than Bush\'s preference for
preemptive war and unilateralist predispositions. But the virtuous
imperatives are in full evidence in the Clinton strategy: \"All of
America\'s strategic interests---from promoting prosperity at home to
checking global threats abroad before they threaten our territory---are
served by enlarging the community of democratic and free market nations.
Thus, working with new democratic states to help preserve them as
democracies committed to free markets and respect for human rights, is a
key part of our national security strategy.\"

[It is hardly surprising]{.underline}, then, [that many liberals, both
within the government and the university, supported the war against
Iraq,]{.underline} and hardly unfair to question the extent to which
Clinton and other moral interventionists prepared the high ground for
this war. [As a microcosm, consider one of the most visible splits in
the ranks at top American universities, when such \"moral\" liberals
as]{.underline} Joseph [Nye,]{.underline} Michael [Ignatieff,
and]{.underline} Samantha [Power came out in support of the war, whereas
such \"amoral\" realists as]{.underline} Stanley Hoffmann, Steve Walt,
and John [Mearsheimer publicly opposed it. Nietzsche, who always
detected the smell of the swamp in all talk of virtue]{.underline},
finds in *The Twilight of the Idols* a \"bestowing virtue\" [in the
realist\'s \"courage in the face of reality]{.underline}\": \"My
recreation, my preference, my *cure* from all Platonism has always been
*Thucydides*. Thucydides, and perhaps the *Principe* of Machiavelli, are

**A refusal to close the question of ethics creates continual
interrogation of values that has greater potential to transform
relationships of power.**

**Scott---90**(Charles E., professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State
University, "The Question of Ethics: Nietzsche, Foucault, Heidegger,"
Ed. John Sallis, p. 7-8)

[In the question of ethics, the emphasis falls on a continuing process
of thinking that diagnoses, criticizes; clarifies by means of questions,
destructures the components of meaning and power that silently shape our
lives together, and also questions the values and concepts that have
rule-governing and axiomatic power in our culture. The emphasis does not
fall on the possible complete systematic accounts that prescribe
definitive solutions to problems**,**]{.underline} \'right\' structures
of value, originary or utopian visions of preferred types of personal
identity. Thinking and writing, rather, take place in the
questionableness and the problems that arise in the constellations of
belief, knowledge, and evaluation that constitute us and set the
parameters for what we may legitimately desire and the manners in which
we normally relate to people and things. The question of ethics does not
arise outside of ethics, but from within it. [Its thought is disciplined
by efforts to maintain questionableness, by learning how to ask
questions in given settings, and by finding its own heritage and its
problems. Learning to name things anew,]{.underline} to become alert to
exclusions and to forgotten aspects in a people\'s history[, to overhear
what is usually drowned out by the predominant values, to rethink what
is ordinarily taken for granted,]{.underline} to find out how to hold
itself in question: [these are aspects of the thought of the question of
ethics.]{.underline} There is a subversiveness in such processes
vis-à-vis the normal and ordinary, a subversiveness not unlike that of
poets and philosophers who are routinely excluded or silenced by
totalitarian regimes. But subversiveness is neither a goal nor an ideal
for the question of ethics. [Its goal is to rethink, rework, rewrite, to
listen again to the cultural inevitabilities that make us who we are and
to affirm the transformative process]{.underline} without sense of
origin or teleology[.]{.underline}

**By removing absolute moral values, the alternative forces us to
investigate ethics.**

[Without ultimate value, people and beings are heard in the 'mere'
quality of their life struggles.]{.underline} [Their hierarchies and
roles are at best conveniences]{.underline} in a given way of life.
[Without sanctity their anguish and happiness can be clearly
heard]{.underline}--- not necessarily heard, but possibly heard--- [in
the interruption of the inherited claims to ultimacy, claims that
suggest a staggered range of importance concerning who is anguished or
happy. An absence of ultimate importance levels us all]{.underline},
discloses us all without the sanctions of the many orders of our lives.
In such an interruption of ethics the ascetic ideal of Heidegger's
approach to being, this part of [our Western ethos, is momentarily
suspended, and the question of ethics affects the beginning of steps
that one might take toward retrieving something in our tradition that
has been lost. The lostness, our common lack of essence]{.underline},
not what has been lost, affects us and [provokes us to
think]{.underline} in that moment.

# alt solves: respect for the other

**Nietzschean politics treat the Other as a worthy opponent in
democratic discourse. It creates a deeper respect than appeals to
equality.**

**Hatab, 02** (Prospects For A Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be
Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

I think that Nietzsche\'s attack on democracy ought to be challenged,
but not by reasserting democratic traditions, but by showing that [much
of Nietzsche\'s cultural and philosophical outlook is compatible
with,]{.underline} even constitutive of, much of [democratic
politics]{.underline}. So the distinction between cultural and political
spheres allows us to challenge some of Nietzsche\'s political vision;
but overlaps between the spheres show that [Nietzsche\'s
authoritarianism is weakened by his own philosophical orientation, and
that democratic political life can exhibit certain creative,
nonegalitarian, and agonistic elements]{.underline} to a degree that may
warrant calling it Nietzschean enough to support a democratic
appropriation of Nietzsche (thus answering Appel\'s challenge). Assuming
that politics should not be restricted and reserved for an elite, but
open to the participation of all citizens, can we retain a sense of
respect and political rights in appropriating Nietzsche for democracy? I
think so. In fact, [Nietzschean conceptions of agonistics and
nonfoundational openness can go a long way toward articulating and
defending democratic practices without the problems attaching to
traditional principles of equality.]{.underline} [If political respect
implies inclusiveness and an open regard for the rightful participation
of others, an agonistic model of politics can underwrite respect without
the need for substantive conceptions of equality]{.underline} or even
something like \"equal regard.\" I have already mentioned that
agonistics can be seen as a fundamentally social phenomenon. [Since the
self is formed in and through tensional relations with others, then any
annulment of my Other would be an annulment of myself. Radical
agonistics, then, discounts the idea of sheer autonomy and
self-constitution. Such a tensional sociality can much more readily
affirm the place of the Other in social relations]{.underline} than can
modern models of subject-based freedom. Moreover, the structure of an
agon conceived as a contest can readily underwrite political principles
of fairness. Not only do I need an Other to prompt my own achievement,
but the significance of any \"victory\" I might achieve demands an able
opponent. As in athletics, defeating an incapable or incapacitated
competitor winds up being meaningless. So I should not only will the
presence of others in an agon, I should also want that they be able
adversaries, that they have opportunities and capacities to succeed in
the contest. And I should be able to honor the winner of a fair contest.
Such is the logic of competition that contains a host of normative
features, which might even include active provisions for helping people
in political contests become more able participants. 25 In addition,
agonistic respect need not be associated with something like positive
regard or equal worth, a dissociation that can go further in facing up
to actual political conditions and problematic connotations that can
attach to liberal dispositions. Again allow me to quote my previous
work. Democratic respect forbids exclusion, it demands inclusion; but
respect for the Other as other can avoid a vapid sense of \"tolerance,\"
a sloppy \"relativism,\" or a misplaced spirit of \"neutrality.[\"
Agonistic respect allows us to simultaneously affirm our beliefs and
affirm our opponents as worthy competitors]{.underline} [in public
discourse. Here we can speak of respect without ignoring the fact that
politics involves perpetual disagreement]{.underline}, and we have an
adequate answer to the question \"Why should I respect a view that I do
not agree with?\" In this way beliefs about what is best (aristos) can
be coordinated with an openness to other beliefs and a willingness to
accept the outcome of an open competition among the full citizenry
(demos). Democratic respect, therefore, is a dialogical mixture of
affirmation and negation, a political bearing that entails giving all
beliefs a hearing, refusing any belief an ultimate warrant, and
perceiving one\'s own viewpoint as agonistically implicated with
opposing viewpoints. In sum[, we can combine 1) the historical tendency
of democratic movements to promote free expression, pluralism, and
liberation]{.underline} from traditional constraints[, and 2) a
Nietzschean perspectivism and agonistic respect, to arrive at a
postmodern model of democracy]{.underline} that provides both a
nonfoundational openness and an atmosphere of civil political discourse.

**Nietzsche's concept of will to power can only manifest itself through
social relations---it requires the presence and engagement with the
other.**

[How can we begin to apply the notion of agonistics to politics in
general and democracy in particular? First of all, contestation and
competition can be seen as fundamental to self-development and as an
intrinsically social phenomenon]{.underline}. Agonistics helps us
articulate the social and political ramifications of Nietzsche\'s
concept of will to power. [As Nietzsche put it]{.underline} in an 1887
note, \"[will to power can manifest itself only against
resistances]{.underline}; it seeks that which resists it\" (KSA 12,
p.424). [Power, therefore, is not simply an individual possession or a
goal of action; it is more a global, interactive conception. For
Nietzsche, every advance in life is an overcoming of some obstacle or
counterforce, so that conflict is a mutual co-constitution of contending
forces]{.underline}. Opposition generates development. The human self is
not formed in some internal sphere and then secondarily exposed to
external relations and conflicts. [The self is constituted in and
through what it opposes and what opposes it; in other words, the self is
formed through agonistic relations. Therefore, any annulment of one\'s
Other would be an annulment of one\'s self in this sense. Competition
can be understood as a shared activity for the sake of fostering high
achievement and self-development, and therefore as an intrinsically
social activity.]{.underline}

# alt solves: value to life

**Suffering and loss are inevitable parts of a chaotic world---our
alternative enables us to find meaning and lead a joyful life despite
crises.**

**Groff 04** -- Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Bucknell University
-- 2004 (Peter S, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, "Al-Kindi and Nietzsche
on the Stoic Art of Banishing Sorrow," Issue 28, Autumn 2004, pg.
139-173)

Nietzsche goes on to reflect on the lies and \"deadly silence\" with
which the advocates of extirpation have tried to hide the \"over-rich
happiness\" \[überreiche Glück\] of passionate people, and concludes:
\"Is our life really painful and burdensome enough to make it
advantageous to exchange it for a Stoic way of life and petrification?
We are not so badly off that we have to be as badly off as Stoics\" (GS
326). But Nietzsche is merely scratching the surface here, for [the more
fundamental question is whether suffering is something that necessarily
ought to be ameliorated]{.underline}. In an earlier aphorism from the
same book, Nietzsche ostensibly accepts the Stoics\' doctrine of the
inextricable bond between pleasure and pain, while at the same time
drawing a radically different conclusion: \[W\]hat if pleasure \[Lust\]
and displeasure \[Unlust\] were so tied together that whoever wanted to
have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of
the other---that whoever wanted to learn to \"jubilate up to the
heavens\" would also have to be prepared for \"depression unto death\"?
And that is how things may well be. At least the Stoics believed that
this was how things were, and they were consistent when they also
desired as little pleasure as possible, in order to get as little
displeasure as possible out of life\.... To this day [you have a choice:
either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief \... or
as much displeasure as possible as the price for the growth of an
abundance of subtle pleasures]{.underline} \[Lüsten\] and joys
\[Freuden\] that have rarely been relished yet. [If you decide for the
former and desire to diminish and lower the level of human
pain]{.underline} \[Schmerzhaftigkeit\], [you also have to diminish and
lower the level of their capacity for joy]{.underline}. Nietzsche
concludes this aphorism with a rumination on the power of science to
promote either goal: it can make us \"colder, more like a statue, more
Stoic,\" but it also has the \"immense capacity for making new galaxies
of joy flare up\" (GS 12). To some extent, the Stoics function in this
passage as a foil for Nietzsche\'s imperative to experiment---or \"live
dangerously,\" as he famously puts it (GS 283)---and one is reminded of
Nietzsche\'s reflections on the health of the soul, where he poses the
troubling question of the potential value of illness (GS 120). However,
in spite of this we can already begin to see a more fundamental
agreement between Nietzsche and the Stoics that underlies their
internecine dispute and indeed makes it possible in the first place.
Nietzsche\'s claim that \"much displeasure\" is a prerequisite for our
capacity to experience great joy recalls his claim that suffering is a
condition for the possibility of human greatness. Yet this assertion is
not necessarily at odds with Stoic ethics, for whenever Nietzsche extols
the virtues of suffering (insofar as it makes us profound and
contributes to the growth and intensification of power), his primary
target is the morality of pity. And Nietzsche and the Stoics are
actually in accordance in their low estimation of the value of pity
\[Mitleid\] (D 139).75 Thus in order to understand Nietzsche\'s
Stoicism, it is crucial to distinguish between eliminating suffering and
banishing sorrow. Nietzsche explicitly rejects the former program,
inasmuch as it makes us small, mediocre, and ignoble. However, while
Nietzsche valorizes suffering, he by no means advocates sorrow. [The
essential Nietzschean orientation toward the world is not one of
recoiling, sadness, or regret, but rather one of affirmation, gaiety,
cheerfulness, and joy. In order to make sense of this apparent tension
in his thought, we might provisionally think of suffering as a brute,
inescapable fact of embodied existence, and sorrow as one optional
interpretation of that experience. In other words, sorrow and joy both
have to do with one\'s interpretation and evaluation of the meaning and
value of suffering.]{.underline} The Stoic can no more eliminate
suffering than he can eliminate loss. As became clear in al-Kindī\'s
epistle, [loss is necessary and inevitable, but sorrow is not. In a
similar way, the Nietzschean \"ideal\" is to become strong and healthy
enough joyfully to affirm the entirety of existence---even its
\"accursed and loathsome aspects,\" including suffering]{.underline}
(KSA 13.16\[32\], cf. EH P3). To attain this standpoint, I suggest, is
to banish sorrow.

# alt solves: intolerance

**Affirmation of difference enables a more robust conception of
tolerance. We do not advocate a nihilistic abandonment of values but the
simple acceptance that others will have competing values.**

**Hatab, 02** (Lawrence J. Professor of Philosophy at Old Dominion
Univrsity 2002 Prospects for a Democratic Agon Why We can still be

In fact, Nietzschean conceptions of agonistics and [nonfoundational
openness can go a long way toward articulating and defending democratic
practices without the problems attaching to traditional principles of
equality]{.underline}. If political respect implies inclusiveness and an
open regard for the rightful participation of others, an agonistic model

[An agonistic politics construed as competitive fairness can sustain a
robust conception of political rights, not as something \"natural\"
possessed by an original self, but as an epiphenomenal, procedural
notion conferred upon citizens in order to sustain viable political
practice]{.underline}. Constraints on speech, association, access, and
so on, simply insure lopsided political contests. We can avoid
metaphysical models of rights and construe them as simply social and
political phenomena: social in the sense of entailing reciprocal
recognition and obligation; political in the sense of being guaranteed
and enforced by the state. We can even defend so-called positive rights,
such as a right to an adequate education, as requisite for fair
competition in political discourse. Rights themselves can be understood
as agonistic in that a right-holder has a claim against some treatment
by others or for some provision that might be denied by others. In this
way rights can be construed as balancing power relations in social
milieus, as a partial recession of one\'s own power on behalf of the
power of others---which in fact is precisely how Nietzsche in an early
work described fairness and rights (D 112). And, as is well known, the
array of rights often issues conflicts of different and differing
rights, and political life must engage in the ongoing balancing act of
negotiating these tensions, a negotiation facilitated by precisely not
defining rights as discrete entities inviolably possessed by an
originating self. Beyond political rights, a broader conception of
rights, often designated as human rights as distinct from political
practice, can also be defended by way of the kind of nonfoundational,
negative sense of selfhood inspired by Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, the
self is a temporal openness infused with tragic limits, rather than some
metaphysical essence, stable substance, or eternal entity. A via
negativa can be utilized to account for rights as stemming not from what
we are but from what we are not. So much of abusive or exclusionary
treatment is animated by confident designations and reductions as to
\"natures\" having to do with race, gender, class, role, character, and
so on. \[End Page 143\] Nonfoundational challenges to \"identity\" may
seem unsettling, but if we consider how identities figure in injustices,
a good deal of [work can be done to reconfigure rights as based in
resistance. It is difficult to find some positive condition that can
justify rights and do so without excluding or suppressing some other
conditions. But a look at human history and experience can more readily
understand rights and freedom as emerging out of the irrepressible
tendency of human beings to resist and deny the adequacy of external
attributions as to what or who they \"are.\" It may be sufficient to
defend rights simply in terms of the human capacity to say
No]{.underline}.

# alt solves: nihilism

**By embracing self-overcoming, we escape the nihilistic tendency to
dwell on death and destruction. Nietzsche calls upon us to embrace life
by affirming its chaotic elements and create meaning
[despite]{.underline} inevitable suffering.**

**Scott, 90** (Charles E., professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State
University, "The Question of Ethics: Nietzsche, Foucault, Heidegger,"
Ed. John Sallis, p. 173-174)

[One pathogenic aspect of our Western ethos that we have followed is the
ascetic ideal.]{.underline} It is characterized by many types of refusal
and denial regarding the manner in which human life occurs, and [on
Nietzsche\'s account the ascetic ideal reinforces this denial with a
habitual insistence on the continuous presence of meaning in all
dimensions of life and being. In our ascetic withdrawal from life we
join forces with hopelessness, suffering, death, and helplessness by
giving them meaning, in our appropriation of them, that far exceeds
their occurrence]{.underline} and that subordinates them within a scheme
of meaning and hope. The rule governing the ascetic ideal is found in
its incorporation and blind expression of the hopelessness and
meaninglessness that it is designed to overcome. [This incorporation of
what it is constitutes the ideal\'s nihilism for Nietzsche: **the
affirmations within the ascetic ideal project their opposites and
produce a spiral of unwitting and inevitable violence in the
spirituality that they create**. The denial of life within the
boundaries of the ascetic ideal continuously reestablishes the power of
the ideal. **But when this movement is broken by a
self-overcoming**]{.underline} like that in Nietzsche\'s genealogy of
the ascetic ideal, the rule of the ascetic ideal is interrupted and [**a
possibility is opened for life-affirmations that do not suppress the
most fearful occurrences involved in being alive**.]{.underline} The
joyousness of life without the illusion of continuous meaning, the
joyousness that Nietzsche found in early Greek culture, was lost,
according to his reading, in the course of the increasing cultural
dominance of those whose nerve has failed before the disheartening flow
of life. The ascetic ideal expresses this failure in its insistence on
meaning and in its persistent manufacture of hope out of illusions bred
of the failure. Heidegger is perhaps at his most non-Nietzschean point
when in his Rector\'s address he turns to the Greek division between the
everyday and the question of being. This is an ironic moment in
Heidegger\'s thought: he traces the origins of his own move to separate
the future of the German university from the German Volkstum, (that is,
from dominant popular culture) to the emergence of the separation of
thought from everyday life in Greek culture. But this move is not
associated with the joyousness that Nietzsche uses as his reference in
delimiting the ascetic ideal. According to Nietzsche\'s genealogy we
have lost an earthly affirmation of life in the midst of the specific
suffering of everyday existence. Nietzsche countenances fully the
brutality, the fateful shattering of hope, the disappointments that
break people\'s lives, the individual and social tragedies. The
debilitation of minds and bodies is juxtaposed to people\'s savoring
food and drink, enjoying sexual pleasure. It is juxtaposed to
friendship, the energy of ambition, the struggle between competitors,
the mixture of desperation and exhilaration in efforts of
accomplishment. [Nietzsche\'s move is toward affirmation in the midst of
chaotic living when he speaks of what is lost in the blind and
self-deceived chaos of asceticism that is ordered by the illusion of
continuous meaning. In this affirmation one has an
awareness]{.underline}, presumably a full awareness, [of the otherness
to human interest that radically distresses us]{.underline}. People\'s
attention is delimited by it. [Rather than escape or turn away from it,
people are delimited by it in their relations with things.]{.underline}
Rather than appropriate the suffering of life in ascetic self-denial,
human beings stand over against its otherness, its unthinkableness, its
density. They need not attempt to embody it in forms that seem to shape
it to human and thinkable dimensions. [They live in the inappropriable,
meaningless dark vacuity,]{.underline} with it and other to it, out of
it and in it. They are angel and animal, Nietzsche said. [Not to be
lost, not to be redeemed, not to be overcome, it is juxtaposed to a will
to live, an affirmation with, and not in spite of, the
chaos]{.underline}.

# alt solves: nihilism

**Rejecting a quest for truth and asking "why not rather untruth? or
uncertainty?" realizes the positive potential of the death of God and
avoids a slide into nihilism.**

[The danger of the late-modern nihilistic Will to Truth is that this
reactive \'will to negation\',]{.underline} while yearning for a
truthful foundation, can only destroy and negate. Even anthropocentric
recreations of authoritative Truth, such as faith in progress,
utilitarian happiness-for-everyone, socialist utopias, or Kant\'s
secularised teleologies, cannot survive the scrutiny of this nihilistic
Will to Truth. As Michael Haar notes, \[a\]fter having killed God-i.e.
after having recognized the nothingness of the \'true world\'-and after
having placed himself where God once was, Man continues to be haunted by
his iconoclastic act: he cannot venerate himself, and soon ends up by
turning his impiety against himself and smashing this new idol.64 The
radical and untempered scepticism of scientific Will to Truth undermines
the foundational meanings of the modern world and thus [threatens modern
life with the prospect of unconditional nihilism.]{.underline} [The Will
to Truth must become \'conscious of itself as a problem\' if it is to
avoid this fate]{.underline}.65 [And with the historical stage of late
modernity, we are able to explore the possibilities of this
self-overcoming of the Will to Truth]{.underline}. As Nietzsche states,
\'\[w\]e finally come to a complete stop before a still more basic
question. We ask about the value of this will. [Suppose we want Truth:
why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? even
ignorance?]{.underline}\'66 In this question, [Nietzsche at last sees
the positive potential of the death of God. For while the danger of
nihilism is ever-present,]{.underline} Nietzsche suggests that [the fact
that\' a new problem arises: that of the value of truth]{.underline},
[allows us to question the previously \'natural\' belief that we must
ground philosophical foundations in the notion of a dichotomised world
in which only ideal and \'true\' values can structure and guide human
interaction]{.underline}. Nietzsche forces the Will to Truth to \'draw
its most striking inference, its inference against itself\... \[and)
pose the question \"what is the meaning of all truth?\"\'68 In doing
so[, he problematises the authority and the value of a dichotomised
model of action structured unquestioningly by a conception of normative
Truth. Nietzsche\'s paradoxical charge is thus to overcome the Will to
Truth and found a renewed philosophical will to power, while
simultaneously avoiding the abyss of modern nihilism.]{.underline} For
us moderns, exposed without the reassurance of God or Truth, \'it is a
rendezvous, it seems, of questions and question marks\' .69 Questions
and Question Marks: The Will to Truth of \'Anti-Foundationalism\' If the
self-overcoming of the Will to Order has undermined the foundation from
which pol itics-as-making emerged, and on which it is dependent, then it
is clear that our normative understanding of political action must be
profoundly rearticulated. [From this perspective, the central question
before normative IR theory in late modernity is to understand political
action without the assurances of Truth or Reason, while simultaneously
avoiding the slide into decadent nihilism and scientific
meaninglessness]{.underline}. Some might suggest, however, that this is
exactly the project of many of the \'dissident\' scholars of IR. On the
one hand, I agree that such a \'post-modern\' ethic is necessary,
possible, and emergent in some of the critical literature. In fact, an
inextricable component of much of this scholarship is its
self-consciously normative stance. Moreover, the frequent, if rarely
elaborated, calls for tolerance, difference, dialogue, otherness,
thinking space, radicalised democracy, etc., clearly delineate at least
several ethical agendas.70

# alt solves: democracy

**Abandoning the will to truth opens up the possibility of genuine
democracy---accepting discord and uncertainty is deeply liberating.**

Relations Theory", Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 25

Paul)

In this context, plurality and natality cannot be realised, because
individualisation becomes atomisation through autonomy, which destroys
any possibility of a simultaneous and comprehensive realisation of human
universality. [Arendt]{.underline} therefore [reconceptualises freedom
not as the liberal utopia of absolute liberation, sovereignty, and
autonomy, but rather as the process of free spontaneity and creation
through communal political interaction.90 In this sense, Arendt
profoundly reconsiders freedom and equality, and grounds them not as
ideal goals, but rather as constitutive elements of the process of
political interaction. In doing so, she manages to revitalise the
foundation for equality and freedom, while focusing on the importance of
the participatory process, not the ideal end, of political
action]{.underline}. This is not to suggest that Arendt\'s work
represents the \'next stage\' of IR theory. Rather, Arendt\'s importance
is that she recognises both the necessity of foundation and the fact
that the self-overcoming of the Will to Truth/Order undermines the
traditional conception of foundationalism. [By offering a renewed
foundation-the importance of politics as a process through which to
resolve the existential experience of plurality-without grounding it in
an untenable Will to Order/Truth,]{.underline} Arendt forwards an
important and appropriate reconsideration of the \'political\' which
underlines the historicity of politics-as-making, while also offering a
renewed model of the possibility of politics. Fusing politics and
philosophy by recognising the politics of philosophy as well as the
potentially philosophical role of politics, [Arendt fulfils Nietzsche\'s
call and affirms both the Death of God and the end of politics-as-making
while avoiding a decadent and nihilistic will to
nothingness.]{.underline} The question is not, therefore, whether
Arendt\'s foundation is \'true\' and thus represents the only response
to late modernity. Rather, we must consider whether we could use this
understanding to reground and reconceptualise the normative
possibilities of political action. For if Arendt and Nietzsche stress
anything, it is that [the question of foundation no longer relies on the
threadbare and familiar chorus of Truth. Instead, it must be open to the
harmony and discord of political debate.]{.underline} IR theory cannot
ignore this historical context. Although the discipline has long
employed the claim to a \'discrete area of analysis\' as a bulwark
against unwanted \'meta-theoretical\' criticism, this self-imposed
monasticism is not justifiable, IR theory can claim to profoundly
contemplate normative questions only if we reconsider and problematise
the most basic assumptions and philosophical foundations of IR theory.
For it is clear that the Will to Order and its characterisation of
politics-as-making is neither a natural nor neutral origin. To realise
this is to assert the historical importance and influence of any
underpinning philosophy and to recognise the contemporary need for a
sustained reconsideration of the possibilities, and limitations, of
political action. If I have turned to Arendt and Nietzsche as guides in
this endeavour, it is because they recognise that to live in late
modernity[, to live in a political realm with neither authority nor the
concomitant awareness that the source of authority
transcends]{.underline} power and [those who are in power, means to be
confronted anew, without the religious trust in a sacred beginning and
without the protection of traditional]{.underline} and therefore self
evident standards of behaviour, by the elementary problems of human
living together.91 [This, above all else, is the challenge and the
potential of the Death of God]{.underline}.

To pursue these possibilities, I want to consider first Nietzsche the
genealogical \"psychologist,\" the thinker who deploys speculative
genealogies to probe the psychological production of values such as
justice, equality, or Christian morality. What is the significance of
Nietzsche\'s diagnostic pose and genealogical approach for reconceiving
a relation ship of theory to politics? How does genealogy itself
refigure the relation between the intellectual and the political? How
does genealogy\'s crossing of philosophy and history open up the
political present without it self taking the place of politics? [\"We

this ignorance that Nietzsche seeks to redress with his genealogical

power but also its thwarted forms-envy, resentment, jealousy, and
revenge) [that materialize into the moral and political formations of
equality, liberal justice, and the state.]{.underline} Unlike other
genres of philosophical or historical criticism, including those

to their ordinary ordering and situation. In this, [genealogy
paradoxically aims to dislocate that which is both its starting point
and its object: the present. And in that dislocation, it also dislocates
the conventions of politics,]{.underline} morality, and epistemology
constitutive of the present. Nietzsche\'s intentions with genealogy can
also be figured as calling into question the familiar through a complex
of *strategic reversals.* Consider section 6 of the preface to *On the
Genealogy of Morals,* which begins, This problem of the *value* of pity
and of the morality of pity \... seems at first to be merely something
detached; an isolated question mark; but [whoever sticks with it and
*learns* how to ask questions here will experience what I experienced-a
tremendous new prospect opens up for him, a new possibility comes over
him like a vertigo]{.underline}, every kind of mistrust, suspicion, fear
leaps up, his belief in morality, in all morality, falters-finally a new
demand becomes audible. *(GM* P6) In this account of genealogical
movement, Nietzsche reminds us that [genealogy is, at bottom, a form of
artful questioning, a way of asking \"what really happened
there\"]{.underline} about a commonplace. He reminds us too that when
this question truly grips the questioner, it disturbs a much larger nest
of beliefs than that with which the genealogist begins. One might think
here not only of Nietzsche\'s *Genealogy of Morals* but of Foucault\'s
*History of Sexuality* and the way that each calls into question the
*structure* and *function* of conventional beliefs and standard
histories about their subject- and not only the beliefs and histories
themselves. [The questioning Nietzsche recommends is necessarily of a
historical kind.]{.underline} specified in the next portion of the
passage quoted above: [let us articulate this *new demand*]{.underline}
\[that has become audible by virtue of questioning the value of the
morality of pity\]: [we need a *critique* of moral values, *the value of
these values themselves must first be called in question-and* for that
there is needed a *knowledge of the conditions and circumstances in
which they grew, under which they evolved and changed*]{.underline}
(morality as consequence, as symptom, as mask, as tartufferie, as
illness, as misunderstanding; but also morality as cause, as remedy, as
stimulant, as restraint, as poison), *a knowledge of a kind that has
never yet existed or even been desired. (GM* P6; latter two emphases
added) [Calling into question a commonplace]{.underline} (in this case
the value of the morality of pity) **[produces a new political
possibility]{.underline}** (a critique of morality as such), [which in
turn produces a need for a new kind of knowledge]{.underline} (a
particular kind of history of morality). **[A radical critique of moral
values requires knowing the history of how they were occasioned, the
conditions under which they grew, changed, and took hold-precisely the
history that must be buried by values that naturalize themselves as
universal and transhistorical]{.underline}**. But there is something
else highlighted by this passage: [the movement between knowledge and
politics, between questioning and demand, consists of an
*oscillation*]{.underline} that does not collapse these terms into one
another. Questioning produces an experience of vertigo; the vertigo
produces a demand; the demand requires new knowledge; Ind the new
knowledge can materialize into a new worldview. [**The questioning and
the political demand *incite* each other,**]{.underline} but the chain
of incitation would be aborted if the movement collapsed through direct
politicization of knowledge or a reduction of politics to questioning.
Nietzsche continues: One has taken the *value* of these \"values\" as
given, as factual, as beyond all question; one has hitherto never
doubted or hesitated in the slightest degree in supposing \"the good
man\" to be of greater value than \"the evil man,\" of greater value in
the sense of furthering the advancement and prosperity of man in
general. \... But what if the reverse were true? What if a symptom of
regression were inherent in the \"good,\" likewise a danger, a
seduction, a poison, a narcotic, through which the present was possibly
living *at the expense of the future?* \... So that precisely morality
would be to blame if the *highest power and splendor* actually possible
to the type man was never in fact attained? So that precisely morality
was the danger of dangers? *(GM* P6)

# alt solves: new politics

**Over-turning ethical absolutes is critical to personal and political
transformation.**

**Brown, 2000** (Wendy, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Princeton
University and UC Berkeley Humanities Fellow "Nietzsche for Politics" in
"Why Nietzsche Still?" Edited by Alan Schrift, pg. 211-212)

Three different instances of genealogy\'s strategy of reversal emerge in
this passage. [Nietzsche reverses the givenness of everyday values,
upsetting their unchallengeable status in an effort to disclose the
power this status carries and covers. **Whatever has been accepted \"as
factual, as beyond all question,\" shall now be posed as a question, as
a fiction, as utterly dubious because utterly
contingent**]{.underline}**.** But if reversals function as a form of
questioning, they also emerge as part of the answer to the question.
Hence [the morally good is made to appear regressive and dangerous,
rather than progressive and valuable, while morality itself appears as
that which might inhibit]{.underline} rather than foment or express [the
"power and splendor\" of man.]{.underline} Finally,
[genealogy]{.underline} also [conjures a reversal in the accepted course
of history]{.underline}-it challenges progressive accounts with
intimations of regression, [as in suggesting that the present may be
\"living off the future\" rather than paving that future.]{.underline}
If Nietzsche in this preface articulates some of the critical workings
III genealogy and especially its refiguration of the relation between
knowledge and politics, such moments of self-consciousness about this
relation are relatively rare, Foucault renders much more explicit the
aims and effects of genealogy in this regard. He characterizes the
project of genealogy he adapts from Nietzsche as one of discerning the
political "ontology of the present.\" 10 Such discernment is expressly
contrasted with \"an analytics of truth\"-philosophical criticism-a
contrast achieved largely through a postmetaphysical historical, but not
historicist, orientation. A political ontology of the present, which
Foucault sometimes also describes in the terms of \'diagnosis,\' \"does
not consist in a simple characterization of what we are but, instead-by
following lines of fragility in the present-in managing to grasp why and
how that-which is might no longer be that-which-is.\" 11 [A political
ontology of the present,]{.underline} in short, [requires that form of
questioning that unsettles the present\'s givenness, that is \"made in
accordance with these kinds of virtual fracture which **open up the
space of freedom understood as a space of concrete freedom, i.e., of
possible transformation**.\"]{.underline} 12 Foucault\'s endeavor of a
\"diagnosis\" or \"ontology\" of the present entails reconfiguring both
the relationship of philosophy to history and the relation of philosophy
and history to politics. [The task of philosophy becomes curiously
historical: apprehending the nature of ourselves in the
present]{.underline}, [philosophy must recognize us as historical beings
and our time as a time in history. Conversely, history is subjected to
philosophical critique insofar as it must be divested of
reason]{.underline} and direction at the same time that it is tethered
to conventionally philosophical questions: [how can we know our time and
ourselves when we cannot move beyond or outside of them?]{.underline}
While never fully resolvable, Foucault responds to this problem on
genealogy\'s behalf: [\"Effective history studies what is closest, but
in all abrupt dispossession, so as to seize it at a
distance.\"]{.underline}13

# at: time frame outweighs

**The refusal of immediate choice is precisely what gives the critique
the power to force us to question the nature of the political.**

**Brown, 05** (*Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics*,
Wendy, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley).

On the one hand, [critical theory cannot let itself be bound by
political exigency; indeed, it has something of an obligation to refuse
such exigency. While there are always decisive choices to be made in the
political realm]{.underline} (whom to vote for, what policies to support
or oppose, what action to take or defer), [these very delimitations of
choice are often themselves the material of critical
theory.]{.underline} Here we might remind ourselves that prying apart
immediate political constraints from intellectual ones is one path to
being \"governed a little less\" in Foucault\'s sense. Yet [allowing
thinking its wildness beyond the immediate in order to reset the
possibilities of the immediate is also how this degoverning
rearticulates critical theory and politics after disarticulating them;
critical theory comes back to politics offering a different sense of the
times and a different sense of time]{.underline}. It is also important
to remember that the \"immediate choices\" are just that and often last
no longer than a political season (exemplified by the fact that the
political conundrums with which this essay opened will be dated if not
forgotten by the time this book is published). [Nor is the argument
convincing that critical theory threatens the possibility of holding
back the political dark. It is difficult to name a single instance in
which critical theory has killed off a progressive political project.
Critical theory is not what makes progressive political projects
fail;]{.underline} at worst it might give them bad conscience, [at best
it renews their imaginative reach and vigor]{.underline}.

**The refusal to be guided by the crisis of the time is exactly what
allows the critique to disrupt the political order.**

**Brown, 05** (*Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics*,
Wendy, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley).

[The rebuff of critical theory as untimely provides the core matter of
the affirmative case for it. Critical theory is essential in dark times
not for the sake of]{.underline} sustaining utopian hopes, making
flamboyant interventions, or [staging irreverent protests, but rather to
contest the very senses of time invoked to declare critique untimely. If
the charge of untimeliness inevitably also fixes time, then disrupting
this fixity is crucial to keeping the times from closing in on us. It is
a way of reclaiming the present from the conservative hold on it that is
borne by the charge of untimeliness.]{.underline} To insist on the value
of untimely political critique is not, then, to refuse the problem of
time or timing in politics but rather to contest settled accounts of
what time it is, what the times are, and what political tempo and
temporality we should hew to in political life. [Untimeliness deployed
as an effective intellectual and political strategy, far from being a
gesture of indifference to time, is a bid to reset time]{.underline}.
Intellectual and political strategies of successful untimeliness
therefore depend on a close engagement with time in every sense of the
word. They are concerned with timing and tempo. They involve efforts to
grasp the times by thinking against the times. [They attempt, as
Nietzsche put it, to \"overcome the present\" by puncturing the
present\'s \"overvaluation of itself,\" an overcoming whose aim is to
breathe new possibility into the age]{.underline}. If our times are
dark, what could be more important?

# at: non-verifiable

**Theory does not have to be verifiable: the power of critique is its
ability to describe a new vision for the future---it is an act of
construction.**

**Brown, 05** (*Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics*,
Wendy, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley).

Theory is not simply different from description; rather, it is
incommensurate with description. Theory is not simply the opposite of
application but carries the impossibility of application. [As a
meaning-making enterprise, theory depicts a world that does not quite
exist, that is not quite the world we inhabit. But this is theory\'s
incomparable value, not its failure. Theory does not simply decipher the
meanings of the world but recodes and rearranges them in order to reveal
something about the meanings and incoherencies that we live
with]{.underline}. To do this revelatory and speculative work, theory
must work to one side of direct referents, or at least it must disregard
the conventional meanings and locations of those referents. Theory
violates the self representation of things in order to represent those
things and their relation-the world\--differently. [Thus, theory is
never \"accurate\" or \"wrong\"; it is only more or less illuminating,
more or less provocative]{.underline}, more or less of an incitement to
thought, imagination, desire, possibilities for renewal. [There is
another reason that theory cannot be brought to the bar of truth or
applicability. Insofar as theory imbues contingent or unconscious
events, phenomena, or formations with meaning and with location in a
world of theoretical meaning, theory is a sense-making enterprise of
that which often makes no sense, of that which may be inchoate,
unsystematized, inarticulate]{.underline}. It gives presence to what may
have a liminal, evanescent, or ghostly existence. Thus [theory has no
kinship with the project of \"accurate representation\"; its value lies
instead in the production of a new representation, in the production of
coherence and meaning that it does not find lying on the ground but
which, rather, it forthrightly fashions]{.underline}. Similarly theory
does not simply articulate needs or desires but argues for their
existence and thus literally brings them into being. [As theory
interprets the world, it fabricates that world]{.underline} (pace Marx!
especially Marx!); as it names desire, it gives reason and voice to
desire, and thus fashions a new order of desire; as it codifies meaning,
it composes meaning. [Theory\'s most important *political* offering is
this opening of a breathing space between the world of common meanings
and the world of alternative ones]{.underline}, a space of potential
renewal for thought, desire, and action.

Ultimately, however, real-world transformations exceed the grasp of the
*NSS*. The war in Iraq put on full display just how effective the
military could be in attaining its planned goals. But what falls outside
the engineering and imaginary of the plan, what Edmund Burke called the
\"empire of circumstance,\" is in the driver\'s seat and beyond the
cybernetic machinations of the *NSS*, as we see in the \"peace\" that
followed. [Many scholars saw the end of the Cold War as an occasion to
debate the merits of a unipolar future]{.underline} as well as to wax
nostalgic over the stability of a bipolar past. These debates continued
to be state-centric as well as materialist in their interpretation of
how power works. By such criteria, there was little doubt that the
United States would emerge as the dominant military, economic, and,
indeed, civilizational power. Even in Paul Wolfowitz\'s worst-case
nightmares, it was difficult to identify a potential \"peer competitor\"
on the horizon. [But then came 9/11, and blueprints for a steady-state
hegemony were shredded. Asymmetrical power and fundamentalist
resentment, force-multiplied by the mass media, prompted a permanent
state of emergency]{.underline}. After the first responders came a
semiotic fix with a kick, *The National Security Strategy of the United
States of America*[. But from the tragedy of 9/11 to the farce of war in
Iraq, after the multilateral hopes for a \"safer and better world\" were
subverted by the unilateral nihilism of preventive war, the syntax of
order]{.underline} and the code of the simulacrum [began to break down.
We caught a glimpse of a *heteropolar matrix*, in which actors radically
different in identity and interests (states versus super-empowered
individuals), using technologies in revolutionary ways
(]{.underline}civilian airliners to create kamikaze weapons of mass
destruction, the Internet to mobilize the largest antiwar demonstrations
ever), [were suddenly comparable in their capability to produce
improbable global effects. It might be small solace, but out of this
deeply nihilistic moment might yet come a real balance of power *and*
truth,]{.underline} in which the Straussian reach of *The National
Security Strategy* is [foreshortened by a Nietzschean grasp of
reality.]{.underline}

**The way that they frame their harms is not politically neutral. Their

[No political formulation is]{.underline} therefore [innocent. None
refers to a truth about the world that preexists that truth\'s entry
into the world through discourse]{.underline}. Every formula is instead
a clue to a truth[. Each is crafted in the context of a wider discursive
economy of meaning]{.underline}. Tug at the formula, the pull in the
fabric begins to disclose the way in which it has been woven. The
artefactual design of the truth it proclaims then emerges. We are
therefore dealing with something much more than a mere matter of
geopolitical fact when encountering the vocabulary of complex emergency
in the discourse of global governance and liberal peace. We are not
talking about a discrete class of unproblematic actions. Neither are we
discussing certain forms of intractable conflicts. The formula complex
emergency does of course address certain kinds of violent disorder. That
disorder is not our direct concern. Recall with Foucault and many other
thinkers that [an economy of meaning is no mere idealist speculation.
**It is a material political production integral to a specific political
economy of power**]{.underline}. We do not therefore subscribe to the
view championed, for example, by Adam Roberts that the formula complex
emergency is merely a way of giving a new name to an old problem.\[12\]
[We are talking instead about a particular understanding of
(inter)national politics that leads to such **disorder being bracketed**
and addressed **in terms of complex emergency**. For it is only in the
context of a certain political rationality, in this instance the global
governance of liberal peace, that the formula occurs at
all]{.underline}.\[13\] It is in relation to that political rationality
and its hybrid practices of power that the formula not only makes sense
but also does certain kinds of work. [So-called humanitarian emergencies
are always therefore profoundly political events concerned above all
with the responses to the advent of violent change induced by the
constant interplay between the local and the global.]{.underline}

# at: our ethics are universal

**Morals are not a priori, they have different meanings depended up on
the context and so the quest for transcendence is illusory.**

**Turnali, 03** (The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 26 (2003) 55-63,
Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for
Another World, Aydan Turanli, Professor, Department of Humanities and
Social Sciences, Istanbul Technical University).

Nietzsche questions idealization in ethics: [On the Genealogy of Morals
is designed to show that concepts regarding moral issues cannot be
analyzed in a vacuum]{.underline} and this attitude is actually the
product of thinking that there can be an external standpoint in
analyzing concepts. Nietzsche criticizes Plato\'s attempt to define the
perfect man through concepts such as \"good,\" \"wise,\" \"just,\" and
\"dialectician.\" According to him, this is to define \"individuum in
itself.\" It is the \"denaturalization of moral values\" (WP II 430) and
to remove a plant from all soil. [Moral values are naturalized through
Nietzsche\'s conceptual analysis: he gives the genealogy of the concepts
\"good\" and \"evil\" to show that there are no moral values such as
good-in-itself and morality-in-itself over and above the actual uses of
\"good\" and \"evil.\" \"Good\" and \"bad\" are not defined by our a
priori knowledge of them]{.underline}. In order to show this he appeals
to descriptions of historical processes in which these concepts have
been used. [The origin of evil does not lie behind this
world]{.underline}. Rather than searching for the origin behind this
world, we should, Nietzsche suggests, ask \"under what conditions did
man invent the value judgements good and evil\" (GM III Preface).
Nietzsche\'s depiction of the master-slave morality presumes that the
relation between the concepts \"good\" and \"bad\" depends on a class
relation, the relation between the ruling class and the lower class.
\"Good\" was imposed upon the lower class by the upper or ruling class
(GM I 2). \"Good\" was always associated with the upper class, with
Aryans, fair-haired, noble, spiritually distinct, and pure. \"Bad\" was
identified with working class, common, inferior, and poor. Historically,
they were correlated with race and class. While previously concepts or
values such as \"good,\" \"noble,\" \"happy,\" and \"powerful\" were
under the monopoly of aristocrats, with the influence of the Slave
Revolt of Jews and Christians this changed. \"Good\" became associated
with the poor, powerless, sick, ugly, and truly blessed (GM I 6). Hence,
in almost all nations, the values \"good,\" and \"bad\" were inculcated,
or imposed upon the lower class by the ruling class, the class that
possesses power. [Nietzsche\'s analyses of moral values show that there
is no a priori necessity for associating the word \"good\" with
unegoistic actions]{.underline} (GM I 2). [There is no meaning-in-itself
determining the meaning of the concepts \"good\" and \"bad\" once and
for all. Other concepts concerning moral values such as \"guilt,\"
\"obligation,\" or \"justice\" are also analyzed in historical
perspective in the Genealogy. They too, like other moral concepts, are
seen within the perspective of class relationships, power relationships,
purchase and sale relationships, and exchange relationships of creditor
and debtor. Nietzsche\'s conviction that there is no one characteristic
defining moral values stems from his complete rejection of the
traditional Platonic understanding. For him, the whole history of a
thing, or a custom, is a chain of reinterpretations]{.underline} rather
than progress toward a goal (GM II 12). With this step Nietzsche rejects
traditional teleological explanations and this paves the way for
accepting the fluidity of meanings. The concept of \"punishment,\" for
example, has many meanings (GM II 13). The conclusions Nietzsche draws
from the analysis of the concept \"punishment\" show the great
similarities between his views and those of Wittgenstein. Nietzsche
says, \"the history of punishment up to now in general, the history of
its use for a variety of purposes, finally crystallizes in a kind of
unity which is difficult to dissolve back into its elements, difficult
to analyse and, this has to be stressed, is absolutely undefinable\"
(ibid.). He says further that \"all concepts in which an entire process
is semiotically concentrated defy definition; only something which has
no history can be defined\" (ibid.). He also stresses that there cannot
be one element defining a concept, because although in some cases one
element becomes predominant, in other cases other elements may become
important. So the definition of \"punishment\" per se cannot be given
because it is totally dependent on history, context, and uses in actual
cases. This is very similar to Wittgenstein\'s concept of \"family
resemblance.\" Wittgenstein too points out that concepts have meaning
only in the flux of life and most concepts of daily life cannot be
defined by a single characteristic. There is no quality of **\[End Page
59\]** a concept corresponding to the actual features of the world in
our immediate environment. Hence, the intrinsic definition of concepts
cannot be given. Despite this, Wittgenstein and Nietzsche differ with
respect to the methodology of conceptual analysis. Nietzsche goes to the
origins of concepts. He gives the genealogy of concepts. According to
him, concepts can only have meaning when seen from a historical
perspective. He appeals to history, and shows in what ways concepts were
used under different circumstances. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, by
showing connections between concepts, tries to get us to see that most
of our concepts elude clear-cut definition. While criticizing Frege\'s
view that a concept should have definite boundaries, he says, \"Stand
roughly there\" is also enough to describe a concept (PI §71). To define
the concept \"game,\" we give examples and we intend them to be taken in
a particular way. There is nothing common to all types of games. There
is rather \"a complicated network of similarities overlapping and
criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities
of detail\" (PI §66). Wittgenstein does not appeal to history; he does
not give us the origin of concepts. He suggests that we look and see how
concepts are used in daily life, and what relation they have to other
concepts in order to show us that there is no uniformity in their usage.
The point of similarity, on the other hand, is that both Nietzsche and
Wittgenstein reject categories and a prioricity. According to Nietzsche,
the-meaning-in-itself, like other concepts of traditional metaphysics
such as \"unity,\" \"truth,\" \"purpose,\" \"totality,\" \"permanence,\"
\"doer,\" \"atom,\" and \"the thing-in-itself,\" is \"only the seduction
of language (and the fundamental errors of reason petrified within it)\"
(GM I 13). [Nothing in the world actually corresponds to these concepts.
They are, for Nietzsche, subjective categories of the human mind having
no objective existence]{.underline}. ... Nietzsche\'s rejection of
traditional metaphysics finds its culmination in his remark \"God is
dead.\" [For Nietzsche, \"God is dead\" can be interpreted as saying
that there is no realm of transcendent reality, no supersensible world,
no absolute values. Presupposing that there are two different realms,
one an immutable, absolute realm of universal essences, is to degrade
the world in which we live into a world of illusion. It is to deny
reality, the world of senses, of change, and opposition. With the
devaluation of the highest values,]{.underline} Nietzsche abandons the
idea that there are two worlds having an unequal ontological rank: the
true and transcendent world of ideas and the inferior world of senses[.
The only world we have is the world of sensations, change, and
contradiction]{.underline}.

# at: our ethics are an act of self-overcoming

**The notion that our individual ethical orientation can be
transformative is a simplistic substitute for real politics that props
up a Western concept of the all-powerful individual.**

**Brown, 06** (Wendy, Prof Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Regulating Aversion:
Tolerance in an Age of Identity and Empire).

The legal and political formalism of liberalism, in which most of what
transpires in the spaces designated as cultural, social, economic, and
private is considered natural or personal (in any event, independent of
power and political life), is a profound achievement of
depoliticization. [Liberalism's excessive freighting of the individual
subject with self- making, agency, and a relentless responsibility for
itself also contributes to the personalization of political contoured
conflicts and inequalities.]{.underline} These tendencies eliminate from
view various norms and social relations- especially those pertaining to
capital, race, gender, and sexuality- that construct and position
subjects in liberal democracies. In addition, [the reduction of freedom
to rights, and of equality to equal standing before the law, eliminates
from view many sources of subordination, marginalization, and inequality
that organize liberal democratic societies and fashion their
subjects]{.underline}. Liberal ideology at its most generic, then,
always already eschews power and history in its articulation and
comprehensions of the social and the subject. Individualism. The
American cultural emphasis on the importance of individual belief and
behavior, and of individual heroism and failure, is also relentlessly
depoliticizing. [An identification of belief,]{.underline} attitude,
moral fiber, [and individual will with the capacity to make world
history is the calling card of the biographical backstories and
anecdotes that so often substitute for political analyses and
considerations of power]{.underline} in American popular culture. From
Horatio Algers to demonized welfare mothers, from Private Jessica Lynch
to Private Lynndie England, from mythohistories to mythobiographies, [we
are awash in the conceits]{.underline} that right attitudes produce
justice, [that willpower and tenacity produce success,]{.underline} and
that everything else is, at most, background, context, luck, or
accidents of history[. It is a child's view of history and politics:
idealist, personal, and replete with heroes and villains, good values
and bad]{.underline}.

# at: nihilism/no meaning to life

**The refusal of transcendent values forces us to deal creatively with
the world as it is---we are responsible for shaping what we have, not
waiting for an impossible utopia of absolutes.**

**Turnali, 03** (The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 26 (2003) 55-63,
Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for
Another World, Aydan Turanli, Professor, Department of Humanities and
Social Sciences, Istanbul Technical University).

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing
metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche provides an account of how
this craving arises. [The creation of the two worlds such as apparent
and real world, conditioned and unconditioned world, being and becoming
is the creation of the ressentiment of metaphysicians. Nietzsche says,
\"to imagine another, more valuable world is an expression of hatred for
a world that makes one suffer]{.underline}: the ressentiment of
metaphysicians against actuality is here creative\" (WP III 579).
[Escaping from this world because there is grief in it results in
asceticism. Paying respect to the ascetic ideal is longing for the world
that is pure and denaturalized. Craving for frictionless surfaces, for a
transcendental, pure, true, ideal, perfect world, is the result of the
ressentiment of metaphysicans who suffer in this world]{.underline}.
Metaphysicians do not affirm this world as it is, and this paves the way
for many explanatory theories in philosophy. In criticizing a
philosopher who pays homage to the ascetic ideal, Nietzsche says, \"he
wants to escape from torture\" (GM III 6). The traditional philosopher
or the ascetic priest continues to repeat, \"\'My kingdom is not of this
world\'\" (GM III 10). [This is a longing for another world in which one
does not suffer. It is to escape from this world; to create another
illusory, fictitious, false world. This longing for \"the truth\" of a
world in which one does not suffer is the desire for a world of
constancy]{.underline}. It is supposed that contradiction, change, and
deception are the causes of suffering; in other words, the senses
deceive; it is from the senses that all misfortunes come; reason
corrects the errors; therefore reason is the road to the constant. In
sum, this world is an error; the world as it ought to be exists. [This
will to truth, this quest for another world, this desire for the world
as it ought to be, is the result of unproductive thinking. It is
unproductive because it is the result of avoiding the creation of the
world as it ought to be. According to Nietzsche, the will to truth is
\"the impotence of the will to create]{.underline}\" (WP III 585).
Metaphysicians end up with the creation of the \"true\" world in
contrast to the actual, changeable, deceptive, self-contradictory world.
They try to discover the true, transcendental world that is already
there rather than creating a world for themselves. For Nietzsche, on the
other hand, the transcendental world is the \"denaturalized world\" (WP
III 586). The way out of the circle created by the ressentiment of
metaphysicians is the will to life rather than the will to truth. The
will to truth can be overcome only through a Dionysian relationship to
existence. This is the way to a new philosophy, which in Wittgenstein\'s
terms aims \"to show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle\" (PI §309).

transcendent values is critical to check tyranny.**

[Many democratic theorists insist that politics must be grounded in
secure principles, which themselves are incontestable, so as to rule out
anti-democratic voices from having their day]{.underline} and possibly
undermining democratic procedures or results. [A radically agonistic,
open conception of democracy that simply invites any and all parties to
compete for favor seems utterly decisionist, with no justification
beyond its contingent enactment. But from a historical
perspective]{.underline}, despite metaphysical pretenses in some
quarters, [democratic foundings have in fact emerged out of the
\"abyss\" of]{.underline} conventions and [decisional
moments]{.underline}. 28 And with the prospect of a constitutional
convention in our system, it is evident from a performative standpoint
that any results are actually possible in a democracy, even
anti-democratic outcomes (not likely, but surely possible). The
\"tragedy\" is that democracy could die at its own hands.
Foundationalists would call such an outcome contradictory, but a tragic
conception would see it as a possibility intrinsic to the openness of
democratic practice. Can there be more than a simply negative register
in such a tragic conception? I think so. Just as, for Nietzsche, the
tragic allows us to be sensitized and energized for the fragile meanings
of existence, thus enhancing life, [a tragic politics could wean us from
false comforts in foundations and open us to the urgent finite
conditions of political life in an enhanced way. And even if one
conceded the existence of foundational self-evident political
principles, would the force of such principles by themselves necessarily
be able to prevent non-democratic outcomes]{.underline}? If not, the
force of such principles \[End Page 144\] would be restricted to the
solace of intellectual rectitude that can comfort theorists while the
walls are coming down. [The nonexistence of foundational guarantees
surely does not prevent one from living and fighting for democratic
ideals.]{.underline} What is to be said of someone who, in the absence
of a guarantee, would hesitate to act or be obstructed from acting or
see action as tainted or less than authentic? Nietzsche would take this
as weakness. The most profound element in Nietzsche\'s conceptions of
will to power, agonistics, and eternal recurrence, in my view, can be
put in the following way. For Nietzsche, to act in the world is always
to act in the midst of otherness, of resistances or obstacles. Hence to
dream of action without otherness is to annul action. [To affirm one\'s
Other as necessarily constitutive of oneself is not only to affirm the
full field of action]{.underline} (which is the sense of eternal
recurrence), [but also to affirm]{.underline} action as action, that is
to say[, a real move in life amidst real resistances]{.underline}, as
opposed to the fantasy of self-sufficient, fully free, uncontested
occurrences born in Western conceptions of divine perfection and
continued in various philosophical models of demonstrative certainty and
theoretical governance. The irony of a tragically open, agonistic
politics is that it need not \"infect\" political life but in fact spur
it toward the existential environment of it enactment. [And as radically
open, an agonistic politics has the virtue of precluding the silencing
of any voice,]{.underline} [something especially important when even
purportedly democratic dispositions are comfortable with
exclusions]{.underline} (frustrated by citizens who will not come around
to being impartial enough, rational enough, secular enough, deliberative
enough, communal enough, virtuous enough, and so on), [thereby becoming
susceptible to the most ironic and insidious form of tyranny done in
democracy\'s name]{.underline}.

better reading uses Nietzsche to reveal power relations.**

The seven chapters of Appel\'s book provide a vivid and fair reading of
Nietzsche\'s texts that exhibit a forceful call for aristocraticism
based on rank, domination, and exploitation, which should be an
embarrassing obstacle to embracing Nietzsche in the service of
egalitarian political movements. [Appel\'s position]{.underline},
however, [depends upon an unnuanced reading of Nietzsche\'s motifs of
domination and power, which is at least a risky proposition with a
thinker as elusive and complicated as Nietzsche. The genealogical
narrative of master and slave morality need not be read as a call for
domination of the weak by the strong, but as an unmasking of the power
plays of the weak and as an ambiguous blending of master and slave
forces in cultural production, taken as a \"spiritualization\" of
erstwhile natural forces of power]{.underline}. While we might never be
sure of the meaning of Nietzsche\'s rich and elusive texts, this should
not blind us to the seeming aristocraticism in much of Nietzsche\'s
writings. We should admit that such elitism is alive in the texts, and
in this respect Appel is right. Yet [the complexity of the texts should
alert us against both easy dismissals and selective embraces of
Nietzsche when it comes to the question of democracy]{.underline}.

# at: nietzsche is an anarchist/does not apply to politics

**Nietzsche's thought is highly applicable to institutional
governance---they are over stating his anarchic tendencies.**

**Hatab, 02** (Prospects For A Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be
Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

Before exploring these questions and confronting Nietzsche\'s attitude
toward democracy, it is important to set the stage by considering the
matter of institutions, without which political philosophy could very
likely not get off the ground. Modern societies, at least, cannot
function without institutions and the coercive force of law. [Appel,
like many interpreters, construes Nietzsche\'s \"political\" thought as
advancing more an \"aesthetic\" activity than institutional
governance]{.underline} (NCD, p.160ff). [Supposedly Nietzsche envisions
an elite who compete with each other for creative results in isolation
from the mass public; indeed the elite simply use the masses as material
for their creative work, without regard for the fate or welfare of the
general citizenry]{.underline}. Appel maintains that such a political
aesthetics is problematic because it is incompatible with the
maintenance of stable institutions. And [Nietzsche is also supposed to
eschew the rule of law in favor of the hubris of
self-policing]{.underline} (NCD, p.165). If this were true, one would be
hard pressed to find Nietzsche relevant for any political philosophy,
much less a democratic one. [It is a mistake, however, to read Nietzsche
in simple terms as being against institutions and the rule of law on
behalf of self-creation. First of all, even Nietzsche\'s early
celebration of the Dionysian should not be taken as an anti- or
extra-political gesture]{.underline}. In BT 21, [Nietzsche insists that
the Apollonian has coequal status with the Dionysian, and the former is
specifically connected with the political order]{.underline}, which is
needed to temper the Dionysian impulse toward \"ecstatic brooding\" and
\"orgiastic self-annihilation.\" [Those who read Nietzsche as resisting
\"normalization\" and \"discipline]{.underline}\" (this includes most
postmodern readings and Appel\'s as well 13 ), [are not on very firm
ground either. For one thing, Nietzschean creative freedom is selective
and most people should be ruled by normative orders, because universal
unrestricted freedom would cause havoc]{.underline}. 14 [Moreover, even
selective creative freedom is not an abandonment of order and
constraint]{.underline}. Creativity breaks free of existing structures,
but only to establish new ones. Shaping new forms requires formative
powers prepared by disciplined skills and activated by refined
instruments of production. Accordingly, creativity is a kind of
\"dancing in chains\" (WS 140). 15 Creative freedom, then, is not an
abandonment of constraint, but a disruption of structure that still
needs structure to prepare and execute departures from the norm.

**Nietzsche does not call for the destruction of the state---just an end
to slave morality within the law.**

**Hatab, 02** (Prospects For A Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be
Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

[Those who take Nietzsche to be diagnosing social institutions as
descendants of slave morality should take note of]{.underline} GM II,11,
[where Nietzsche offers some interesting reflections on justice and
law]{.underline}. He indicates that the global economy of nature is
surely not a function of justice; yet workable conceptions of justice
and injustice are established by the historical force of human law.
Nietzsche does not indict such forces as slavish infirmities. [Legal
arrangements are \"exceptional conditions\" that modulate natural forces
of power in social directions, and that are not an elimination of
conflict but an instrument in channeling the continuing conflict of
different power complexes. Surprisingly, Nietzsche attributes the
historical emergence of law not to reactive resentment but to active,
worldly forces that check and redirect the \"senseless raging of
revenge,\" and that are able to reconfigure offenses as more
\"impersonal\" violations of legal provisions rather than sheer personal
injuries]{.underline}. Here Nietzsche analyzes the law in a way
analogous to his account of the Greek agon and its healthy sublimation
of natural impulses for destruction. [A legal system is a life-promoting
cultural force that refashions natural energies in less savage and more
productive directions.]{.underline} Finally, those who read Nietzsche as
an anti-institutional transgressor and creator should heed TI
(\"Skirmishes of an Untimely Man,\" 39), where Nietzsche clearly
diagnoses a repudiation of institutions as a form of decadence. Because
of our modern faith in a foundational individual freedom, we no longer
have the instincts for forming and sustaining the traditions and modes
of authority that healthy institutions require. The whole of the West no
longer possesses the instincts out of which institutions grow, out of
which a future grows: perhaps nothing antagonizes its \"modern spirit\"
so much. One lives for the day, one lives very fast, one lives very
irresponsibly: precisely this is called \"freedom.\" That which makes an
institution an institution is despised, hated, repudiated: one fears the
danger of a new slavery the moment the word \"authority\" is even spoken
out loud. That is how far decadence has advanced in the value-instincts
of our politicians, of our political parties: instinctively they prefer
what disintegrates, what hastens the end. In the light of these
remarks[, a Nietzschean emphasis on power and agonistics offers
significant advantages for political philosophy. In some respects we are
freed from the modern project of \"justifying\" the force of social
institutions because of a stipulated freedom from constraint in the
\"state of nature]{.underline}.\"

**Nietzsche is not an anarchist---laws based on competition, such as
separation of powers or the adversarial legal system, fit within the
will to power.**

Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

[Forces of law need not be seen as alien to the self, but as modulations
of a ubiquitous array of forces within which human beings can locate
relative spheres of freedom]{.underline}. And an agonistic conception of
political activity need not be taken as a corruption or degradation of
an idealized order of political principles or social virtues. [Our own
tradition of the separation of powers and an adversarial legal system
can be taken as a baseline conception of the nature, function, and
proper operation of government offices and judicial practice. The
founders of the Constitution inherited from Montesquieu the idea that a
division of powers is the best check on tyranny. In other words, tyranny
is avoided not by some project of harmony, but by multiplying the number
of power sites in a government and affirming their competition through
mutual self-assertion and mistrust]{.underline}. 16 Our common law
tradition is agonistic in both conception and practice. Most procedural
rules are built around the idea of coequal competition in open court
before a jury who will decide the outcome, where the judge in most
respects plays the role of an impartial referee. And the presumption of
innocence is fundamentally meant to contest the government\'s power to
prosecute and punish. 17 I think that [both notions of separation of
powers and legal adversarialism are compatible with Nietzsche\'s
analysis of the law noted previously---that a legal order is not a means
of preventing struggle, but \"a means in the struggle between
power-complexes]{.underline}\" (GM II,11).

Like Nietzsche, then, Steiner derives tragedy from pessimism and
accounts for the decline of tragedy by reference to the triumph of
optimism. But what follows from this account, it should now be clear,
need not be a reactionary aesthetics or politics. Whatever Steiner\'s
intent (which I do not pursue here, though I think it has often been
oversimplified), [Nietzsche\'s \"Dionysian pessimism\" is]{.underline}
the source of [his most radical claims]{.underline}, claims that have,
most recently, appealed to a series of radically democratic political
theorists. Tracy [Strong describes Nietzsche\'s politics as a \"politics
of transfiguration,\" and it is this theme of self-shaping and
self-transformation against a tragic background]{.underline} which is
the key link between Nietzsche and such figures as Camus, Arendt,
Foucault, and William Connolly. Each of these [writers has found in
Nietzsche a portrait of energetic individuality that can be supportive
of democracy while remaining distinct from the liberal assumptions that
are often assumed to be a necessary complement to democratic theory.
Nietzsche\'s pessimism does not require elitism, and it does not
recommend passivity.]{.underline} Instead, as these twentieth-century
inheritors of [Nietzsche]{.underline} have seen, it [sanctions a process
of identity-renovation based not on an assumption of the self\'s natural
integrity but, to the contrary, on an acknowledgment of its fundamental
instability and perishability.]{.underline} While [acknowledging limits
to the human condition]{.underline}, this is a politics of possibility
more radical than most. It makes little sense, therefore, to link
pessimism (or pessimism-cum-tragedy) with conservative politics. [The
pessimistic spirit is a restless one, unlikely to be enamored of the
status quo.]{.underline}

weakness.**

**Robertson, 09** (Simon, "Nietzsche\'s Ethical Revaluation," The
Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 37, pp. 66-90)

Sometimes [Nietzsche]{.underline} countenances a noble person treating
others as a mere means (contrary to central moral tenets \[ *SE* 6;
*BGE* 258, 273; *WP* 962\]). Yet he also [suggests]{.underline} that
["many actions called immoral ought to be avoided and
resisted"]{.underline} ( *D* 103); that [hurting others "is a sign that
we are still lacking power]{.underline}" ( *GS* 13); and that ["when an
exceptional human being handles the mediocre more gently than he does
himself or his equals, this is not merely politeness of the heart---it
is simply his *duty* "]{.underline} ( *A* 57; cf. *BGE* 260). The
question is how such apparently conflicting strands might be reconciled.
The beginnings of an approach might appeal to Nietzsche's notion of
self-sufficiency: [the more self-sufficiently one achieves one's
goals]{.underline} (e.g., [without using or hurting others as
means]{.underline}), [the more excellent one is.]{.underline} Even so,
doing so (though signaling lack of power) may sometimes be necessary. We
might thereby understand self-sufficiency as (a formal condition)
partially constitutive of what it is to be an excellent individual, in
turn yielding a (defeasible) constraint on conduct: [Nietzsche's higher
men have good reason not to hurt others, since doing so stains their
character by showing them suboptimally self-sufficient and thus less
excellent]{.underline} (see also *Z* :II "The Pitiful"). Much more needs
to be said here; but it indicates a direction by which to avoid the
abhorrent conclusions some passages initially imply.

**Despite some of Nietzsche's absurdist statements about women, his
radical affirmation of difference undermines patriarchy.**\

As the temporality of the Ubermensch, the eternal recurrence offers a
structuring of time that is at once infinite and plural. It is a
temporal vision that embraces the polytheism of the world emerging in
the wake of God\'s death, and delights in the entanglement of all things
emerging in the beyond of good and evil. In this, my
feminist-perspective interpretation of the eternal recurrence, I am
suggesting that the fluidity of the eternal return offers a vision of
male and female which breaks the boundaries of traditional Western
categories. In his choice of the term Ubermensch, in his admonition to
get beyond good and evil, where evil is characterized as an attack on
and aversion to otherness, and in his inversion of the traditional
understandings of the male as active and female as passive, 14
[Nietzsche encourages us to articulate new meanings of masculine and
feminine. Sexual differentiation cannot designate the alienation of
otherness to one who stands beyond good and evil; it cannot be an
invitation to domination to one who rejects all pretensions of masterful
expertise; and it cannot be the ground of a patriarchal hierarchy of
values]{.underline} to one who allows his Zarathustra to invoke images
of mothering as he dances his Yea-saying songs. 15 What [sexual
differentiation can be is suggested by the structuring of time Nietzsche
called the eternal recurrence,]{.underline} [where otherness and forms
of differentiation are entangled and affirmed without being annihilated
or devalued.]{.underline} VI. Where does this leave us? With a few
insights and some intriguing possibilities. A general insight is that
[Nietzsche\'s transvaluation of values is also and necessarily a
decompartmentalizing of values according to the patriarchal designated
spheres of male and female.]{.underline} Transvaluation is a
genealogical project that invokes the erotic without allowing the erotic
to be sexualized in accordance with dominant male significations. A more
specific insight concerns the relationship between patriarchy,
historical temporality, and nihilism. Within the Western system of
patriarchy, time is bifurcated into male and female spheres of
otherness. Though the malefemale couple is recognized as a couple, it is
dichotomized into a she who displays reproductive energy in giving birth
and a he who displays creative energy in social, political, and
historical activity. [Nietzsche\'s eternal recurrence offers an
alternative vision of the couple.]{.underline} Here the reproductive and
productive are freed from their enclosure in the sexually designated
private and public domains. Creation and re-creation, transcendence and
immanence, male and female are intimately and complexly complicitous. On
this feminist reading of Nietzsche\'s eternal recurrence, [what
patriarchy designates as disjoined male and female modes of
temporalization is a nihilistic figuring of time intent on subverting an
attentiveness to the ways in which the otherness of male and female must
intercept and inhabit each other if life is to be affirmed]{.underline}.
In this reading, the eternal recurrence\'s nonteleological joyful
affirmation of life is aligned with the affirmation of feminine pleasure
insofar as it is independent of all reproductive functions or goals. It
is linked to what Spivak calls the [double vision]{.underline} that
[affirms the feminine as it undoes sexism.]{.underline} This feminist
reading does not come from nowhere. It is historically situated and
reflects, I believe, the current state of feminist studies. While
earlier feminist thought attempted to discard the sex-biased roles of
patriar chal society by declaring the equality of women, current
feminist work dis tinguishes between the notions of equality and equal
status. Whether it argues for a rejection of male values or demands that
the feminine be rec ognized as an other of equal standing, today\'s
feminists insist on their otherness. [It is this affirmation of
otherness within feminism that sets the stage for a receptivity to
Nietzsche and opens the way for a heterosexual androgynous reading of
the eternal recurrence.]{.underline}

Let us articulate this new demand: We need a critique of moral values,
the values of these values themselves must first be called in
question-and for that there is needed a knowledge of the conditions and
circumstances in which they grew, under which they evolved and changed.2
[What would it mean to question the value of moral values? A collapse
into relativistic amoralism? Or worse, a rejection of the very notion of
ethical action, thus ensuring the rule of the strong over the weak? Or
could this path explore our normative foundation, so as to revitalize
human interaction; to question traditional and \'natural\' limits placed
on normative theory, so as to expand the possibilities of political
action]{.underline}? Perhaps it is necessary to philosophize with a
hammer, so as to hear the hollow ring of those ancient idols and go
beyond them. For [those standards which continue to masquerade as
nature,]{.underline} while covertly structuring the limits of our modern
imagination[, are among those least \'natural\', least
benign,]{.underline} and perhaps, least appropriate to late modernity.
To articulate this demand in International Relations (IR) theory is to
assert the historicity of its normative framework and to suggest that to
evaluate truly the normative value of particular standards of political
action, [the constructed nature of the foundational terms of debate must
be exposed, and their utility reconsidered]{.underline}. Specifically,
it is to recognize that while the conventional opposition of Realism
against Cosmopolitan Idealism highlights significant differences, it
conceals the more important fact that both accept as natural the
philosophical foundation of [the Will to Truth/Order]{.underline}. This
unquestioned philosophical substructure, however, is neither \'natural\'
nor neutral terrain. Rather, I would suggest that this foundation [sets
profound limits on the horizon of normative theory by establishing as
\'natural\' an intellectual framework which severely circumscribes the
very definition, and thus the normative potential, of
politics]{.underline}.

# at: nazism/fascism

**Dogmatism is the ultimate tyranny.**

**Strong, 08** (Tracy B., Prof at UC San Diego "Nietzsche and the
Political" Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Spring/Autumn)

[Tyranny thus arises for Nietzsche from *the failure to remember* that
we live in worlds that we have made: tyranny is thus a forgetting of
human agency]{.underline}, one might say. 9 Much as in the famous
passage about "truth" as a "worn out metaphor," as an "illusion of which
one has forgotten what it really is" ("On Truth and Lies in an
Extra-Moral Sense," *KGW* III.2, 369), there is thus a kind of built-in
amnesia about tyranny, an amnesia that accompanies all acts of volition.
The point here, however, has to do with what tyranny *means* : it is, in
essence, taking as accomplished the world that one has defined and
forgetting that the world in which one lives is one that one has made.
It is for this reason that Nietzsche can write in *BGE* that the ["will
to truth is--- *will to power* "]{.underline} ( *BGE* 211). It follows
from this, however, that Nietzsche does not, and cannot, simply assume
that one can at one's leisure forego this process. Why not? [The most
noteworthy characteristics of the tyrant are his (her?) belief in his
own understanding of the world as simply and finally true and his
failure to question that belief.]{.underline} [The knowledge that the
world in which one lives is one's own world means that that world has no
more validity than one has oneself: this can induce modesty or
megalomania]{.underline}, but it is not a matter of a mitigating Humean
skepticism.

**Nietzsche's criticism of democracy ultimately serves to strengthen

Conventional ways of locating Nietzsche\'s politics include examining
the convergence of his thought with Nazi doctrine; his reduction of all
demands for justice to envy; his misogyny and racism; his heroic ethic
and esteem for ancient Athenian culture; his opprobrium toward the
masses, democracy, socialism, liberalism, and especially the sacred cow
of modernity, political equality. [Nietzsche has been variously
characterized as antipolitical, apolitical, and engaged in a \"politics
of transfiguration\"]{.underline} (Strong). He has been cast as deadly
to politics; as a \"haunt\" or "conscience\" to political thought and
political life; as providing the ethos for a liberal ironism (Rorty),
for a recovery of moral-political responsibility (Honig), and for an
agonistic liberal radicalism (Connolly); and as a \"way out\" of
Marxism, phenomenology, and existentialism in the twentieth century
(Foucault). Most politically sympathetic treatments of Nietzsche try to
draw a politics *out of* his thought, even as they recognize that there
is much in Nietzsche that cannot be redeemed for democratic practice[.
But what if we conceive Nietzsche\'s thought instead as a knife to a
raiment that is the cover for the ideals and practices constitutive of
political life? What if Nietzsche\'s thought does not guide but only
exposes and challenges, functioning to strengthen democratic culture by
disturbing and provoking it?]{.underline} Affirming Foucault\'s

In a 1983 article entitled \"The Nazi Appropriation of Nietzsche,\"
Rudolf Kuenzli
[**^2^**](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_judaism/v017/17.1br_santaniello.html#FOOT2#FOOT2)
expresses astonishment as to how long the denazification of Nietzsche
has taken. He suggests, correctly, I believe, that [to strip away the
caricature of Nietzsche as a \"mad Nazi\" is to be compelled to confront
Nietzsche\'s critiques both of democracy and of Christianity. It is to
face his antifascism and to investigate the significant statements
Nietzsche makes about the nature of German culture]{.underline} and its
contempt for European Jewry. It is to denude our culture of its defense
mechanisms and stand at the edge of the abyss. Perhaps this is why so
many years have elapsed before a book like this could be written.
Nietzsche views Christianity as both antinatural and antihistorical. In
the tradition of Ludwig Feuerbach,
[**^3^**](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_judaism/v017/17.1br_santaniello.html#FOOT3#FOOT3)
Nietzsche claims that humans project both our highest creative
attributes and our most sinister qualities onto a divine being, thereby
diminishing ourselves and failing to recognize the possibility toward
evil that is part of human nature. \"What?\" Nietzsche exclaims, \"A
love encapsulated in if-clauses attributed to an almighty god? A love
that has not even mastered the feelings of honor and vindictiveness\"?
[**^4^**](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_judaism/v017/17.1br_santaniello.html#FOOT4#FOOT4)
According to Nietzsche, Christianity falsifies history by interpreting
all history prior to Jesus as a foreshadowing of Christ\'s coming.
Christianity falsifies the future with the notion of eternal life,
considered by Nietzsche to be the false worship of the self, and it
falsifies reality itself by interpreting God as static and unchanging in
an almost Aristotelian fashion (p. 48). Life, however, is an unending
process of becoming; it is movement and creativity; change in order to
preserve life, not meekness and submission to gain salvation in death.
Thus [Nietzsche\'s critique of Christianity\--which was most strongly a
critique of Christian-dominated European culture\--compels
us]{.underline}, according to Santaniello, [to view Nietzsche on his own
terms and in his own political context, stripped of the veneer later
painted on by his sister Elizabeth]{.underline}. In his critique of
Christianity, Nietzsche is concerned with several issues: the Christian
concept of morality; eschatology; and the implications of the figure of
Christ the Redeemer for the Christian believer\'s notion of self.
Similarly, Nietzsche both directly and indirectly tackles the
ramifications of the Lutheran state-church, the phenomenon of
nationalism, and Christianity\'s central role in the increasingly
virulent anti-Semitism of his time. The vitality of human creativity
requires not the timidity, pity, and humility praised as Christian
values, but courage, \[End Page 104\] honesty, and genuine searchings
that lead toward the flourishing of life, not the glorification of
death. [Protestant teachers in Germany, Nietzsche claims, confuse
morality with obedience and cause in the masses a slow atrophying of the
natural instinct toward spirituality]{.underline} and the religious
life.

Review: *Nietzsche, God, and The Jews: His Critique of
Judeo-Christianity in Relation to the Nazi Myth).*

From 1891 onward, Elisabeth, [Nietzsche\'s sister,]{.underline} compiled
(and then published) what she claimed were the previously unpublished
notes of her famous brother. In fact, until her death in 1935, Elisabeth
[was responsible for feeding]{.underline} to [the leading ideologues of
what became National Socialism]{.underline}\--including Houston Stewart
Chamberlain, Dietrich Eckhart, Joseph Goebbels, Alfred Rosenberg, and
Hitler himself\--presumed statements of Nietzsche\'s professed love of
Christianity, allegiance to Aryan racial supremacy, and (after 1923)
loyalty to the Nazi Party. [These are clearly antithetical to
Nietzsche\'s critiques of]{.underline} Christianity[,
anti-Semitism]{.underline}, and Wagnerism. Under Elisabeth\'s control,
the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar became a propaganda tool for fascist
politics and National Socialism. As Santaniello confirms, [Nietzsche
never wrote a book entitled *The Will to Power*; it was, rather, a
compilation of distorted statements]{.underline} of Nietzsche\'s put
together by Elisabeth herself in 1901, a year after Nietzsche\'s death.
One might speculate that Elisabeth needed to justify her own powerful
anti-Semitic leanings, and in true Freudian style, could not do it in a
better fashion than by deliberately twisting her brother\'s thought.
Thus she could cover up Nietzsche\'s violent break with her mentor,
Richard Wagner, in 1876 and with herself in 1884; she could appropriate
his genius for her purposes, camouflaging her own shallowness,
complacency, and racism. [In truth, Elisabeth\'s false representations
of Nietzsche\'s philosophy represent the very aspects of Christianity
and German culture that Nietzsche so deeply despised]{.underline}. This
is especially evident in her skewed two-volume biography of her
brother,*The Life of Nietzsche* (much of which was written between
1895-1904) and its later popular adaptations,*The Young Nietzsche*
and*The Lonely Nietzsche* (1912-1915). By the time of Elisabeth\'s death
in 1925, Nietzsche\'s appropriation by the Nazis was complete, and he
was continually depicted as a well known anti-Semite of long standing.
In the light of her meticulous biographical and psychological analysis
in Part 1 and textual analyses in Part 2, Santaniello is concerned to
emphasize the \"crucial fact that Nietzsche was a staunch opponent of
antisemitism and that his extremely rare position during his time did
not win for him many popularity contests\" (p. 150). This is significant
in that Santaniello unequivocally demonstrates that [the Nazis\'
deliberate manipulations of the Nietzsche corpus were based not on their
misunderstanding but rather on their astute comprehension]{.underline}
of his work. [They understood only too well that Nietzsche defended the
Jews and defied many of the precursors of National
Socialism]{.underline}: the Wagners, Ernest Renan, Chamberlain,
Gobineau, Stöcker, and the Forsters, his own sister and brother-in-law.
[By adapting and distorting Nietzsche\'s works, the Nazis effectively
silenced his voice.]{.underline}

**Nietzsche explicitly rejects the herd mentality and demands that
people consider their actions in terms of individual moral
judgment---this is incompatible nationalism.**

**Millen, 97** -- Professor of Religion at Wittenberg University -- 1997
(Rochelle L. Millen,
<http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_judaism/v017/17.1br_santaniello.html>
Review: *Nietzsche, God, and The Jews: His Critique of
Judeo-Christianity in Relation to the Nazi Myth).*

[In criticizing the herd morality of Christianity, Nietzsche\'s concern
is the complacency, the lack of rationality, the predominance of the
follower instinct that led to a tradition he viewed as bankrupt.
Christian morality entraps one in a sense of guilt and sinfulness,
precluding the flourishing of true human creativity. Nietzsche also uses
the figure of Jesus to support his claim that works, not faith, are the
way of the Christian life. Jesus\'s legacy was his behavior, an
existential disposition rather than a set of beliefs]{.underline}. Thus
Nietzsche\'s reading of Jewish (i.e., biblical) theology leads to his
holding Judaism responsible for the slave morality characteristic of
Christian society, yet simultaneously and paradoxically he admires
Jewish culture. The centrality of doctrine in Christianity has another
negative implication. By definition, it leads not only to repressed
individuals and a herd morality, but also to religious bigotry.
Christianity for Nietzsche, Santaniello explains, has \"degenerated into
German nationalism with a streak of vengeance\" (p. 56). Thus [part of
Nietzsche\'s critique of Christianity is political: democracy,
socialism, and Christianity encourage mass conformity and project their
discontent on the Jews. Nietzsche disparages German
nationalism]{.underline}, the Lutheran state-church, and the notion of
the *Volk*, all of which\--like Christian doctrine itself\--preclude the
development of healthy cultures.

**The desire to create an ordered word is an authoritarian move---it
requires obedience, violence and a denial of plurality to be achieved.**

**Saurette, 96** (Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Volume
25, Number 1, 1 March 1996 , pp. 1-28(28), Paul, Professor of Political
Studies, University of Ottawa, "I Mistrust All Systematizers And Avoid
Them\': Nietzsche, Arendt And The Crisis Of The Will To Order In
International Relations Theory").

[It has always been a great temptation]{.underline}, for men of action
no less than for men of thought, [to find a substitute for action in the
hope that the realm of human affairs may escape the haphazardness and
moral irresponsibility inherent in a plurality]{.underline} of agents.25
[This exasperation almost invariably led to attempts to abolish the
plurality of the public realm by replacing human interaction with the
absolute control of rulership. This conversion]{.underline}, however,
[fundamentally transforms the understanding of politics by replacing the
notion that to be human is to exist within a plurality and act
\'freely\', with the idea that \'men can lawfully and politically live
together only when some are entitled to command and others forced to
obey\']{.underline}. Arendt contends that this rule-based conception of
political action assumed a hegemonic and \'natural\' status only when
the philosophical transformation of Western civilisation created an
intellectual framework which necessitated interpreting politics as
rulership. From this perspective, the importance of Arendt\'s thought is
that she reveals the way in which [the Will to Order/Truth has created
the parameters of the modern understanding of politics.]{.underline}
According to Arendt, our modern notion of politics is an inevitable
consequence of the Platonic Will to Truth/Order. [After Plato\'s
Republic, politics could no longer be conceived of as the freedom to act
with equals, but could be conceptuaIised only as the ordering of
society]{.underline} according to the world of forms. With this
paradigmatic substitution of making for acting, homo faber becomes the
model political actor, and the realm of human affairs can be interpreted
only in terms of work. Further, [through this transformation, the
concepts of mastery, control, and violence are inextricably imposed onto
the realm of politics]{.underline}.

# at: racism

**Nietzschean politics fit well within democratic values of competition
between ideas, not stratification based on biology.**

**Hatab, 02** (Prospects For A Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be
Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

Appel concedes that a political agon can be healthy and prevent the
establishment of entrenched, permanent hierarchies (NCD, p.162). But he
poses an important question, which is in the spirit of French
neo-liberal critics of Nietzschean politics: [Might not a radical agon
all the way down in political life \"debunk\" important democratic
\"verities\" such as universal suffrage, equal respect, and human
rights]{.underline}? This is indeed a pressing question that many
postmodern writers have not addressed adequately. Yet Appel, like many
critics of postmodernism, simply assumes the truth and necessity of
these traditional democratic notions, without much articulation of how
agonistics threatens these notions, and without any defense of the
viability of these notions in the wake of Nietzschean genealogical
criticisms. Such criticisms have been effectively advanced by
Foucauldian appropriations of Nietzsche that reveal how modern
\"reason\" cannot help being caught up in what it presumes to
overcome---namely regimes of power---and consequently cannot help
producing exclusionary effects and constraints that belie the modern
rhetoric of emancipation. [Nietzsche\'s genealogical critique of liberal
democratic ideals]{.underline}, I think, [is important and still
relevant for political philosophy.]{.underline} The question at hand
turns on two possibilities: Does the critique presume a refutation of
these ideals or does it open up the possibility of redescribing these
ideals in quasi-Nietzschean terms? Appel presumes the former
possibility, I take up the latter, while agreeing that most postmodern
appropriations of Nietzsche have not done much to address either
possibility. We cannot assume the truth of universal suffrage, equality,
and human rights by ignoring Nietzsche\'s trenchant attacks. My strategy
has been to redescribe democratic ideals in the light of Nietzschean
suspicions of their traditional warrants. [Universal suffrage, equality,
respect, and political rights can be defended by way of a postmodern via
negativa that simply rules out grounds for exclusion rather than
postulates conditions that warrant inclusion. Nietzschean
perspectivism]{.underline}, metaphysical suspicion, and agonistics
[simply destabilize politics and prevent even ostensibly democratic
propensities from instigating exclusions or closed conceptions of
political practice]{.underline}. In what follows I will briefly address
two questions: How can a Nietzschean agonistics be extended to the body
politic so as to be viably democratic? How can agonistics redescribe
respect and political rights without the baggage of traditional
egalitarianism so forcefully assailed by Nietzsche? Appel does indicate
that his appraisal of political Nietzscheanism is not meant to discredit
Nietzsche but to invite democrats to face Nietzsche\'s challenge and
defend democratic ideals (NCD, p.167). He admits that Nietzsche forces
us to ask: Why equality? Equality of what? (NCD, p.169). [We cannot
dismiss Nietzsche\'s aristocraticism as irrelevant]{.underline},
uninteresting, or trivial (NCD, p.170). [The strategy of my work has
been to take up this challenge, not by reiterating or renewing defenses
of egalitarianism but by trying to show that democracy need not be
committed to traditional egalitarian rhetoric and so can approach a
Nietzschean comfort with social stratification]{.underline} in ways that
Nietzsche did not expect or think through. Appel is right in calling to
account selective appropriations of Nietzsche by postmodern democrats
who ignore or sidestep his elitism. Few writers who celebrate difference
and democratic openness in Nietzsche\'s name have embraced his
affirmation of excellence. There is difference and then there is
difference. [Excellence is a form of difference that implies gradations
and judgments concerning superior and inferior, better and worse
performances]{.underline}. Many have embraced a Nietzschean openness to
difference on behalf of a generalized liberation of diverse life styles
and modes of self-creation. 19 Such a generalized emancipation, however,
would repulse Nietzsche. He was interested in fostering special
individuals and high achievements. I wonder whether certain postmodern
celebrations of difference conceal a kind of egalitarianism in their
avoidance or suppression of Nietzsche\'s clear comfort with social
stratification. And it is important, in my view, to sustain a sense of
excellence that is vital for both democratic politics and cultural
production. 20 [Excellence and democracy are compatible as long as
excellence is understood in a contextual and performative sense, rather
than a substantive sense of permanent, pervasive, or essential
superiority.]{.underline}

# at: anti-semitism

**Nietzsche's philosophy contains tools to fight against
anti-Semitism.**

**Yovel 02** Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy (Yirmiyahu, Nietzsche,
Godfather of Fascism?: On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy,
"Nietzsche contra Wagner on the Jews" ed. by Jacob Golomb, Robert
Solomon Wistrich)

But even without considering psychology, [there are sufficient
philosophical grounds for Nietzsche\'s active adoption of
anti-anti-Semitism. The anti-Semitic movement contained and heightened
most of the decadent elements in modern culture that Nietzsche\'s
philosophy set out to combat]{.underline}: 1. [Anti-Semitism as a mass
movement was seen by Nietzsche as vulgar, ideological, a new form of
\"slave morality\" representative of the herd]{.underline}. 2.
Anti-Semitism was a popular neurosis, affecting weak people who lacked
existential power and self-confidence. 3. Anti-Semitism, especially in
Germany, served to reinforce the Second Reich and the cult of the state,
which Nietzsche, \"the last Unpolitical German,\" had denounced as \"the
New Idol.\" 4. Anti-Semitism was also a lubricant of German nationalism,
which the mature Nietzsche opposed most insistently (though he did so
\"from the right\"). 5. [Anti-Semitism also depended on racism, which
Nietzsche\'s philosophy rejected as a value distinction among
groups,]{.underline} though he did use race as a descriptive category.
Nietzsche favored the mixing of races within the new Europe he
envisaged. 6. [At the root of anti-Semitism lay a common genealogical
structure of fear, insecurity, existential weakness, and, above all,
ressentiment the malignant rancor against the mentally powerful and
self-affirming, as well as the hatred toward the other as a precondition
for self esteem]{.underline}. The ardor of the anti-Semite conceals his
or her deep insecurity: he does not start with the celebratory
affirmation of his own being, but with the negation of the other by
which alone the anti- Semite proves able to reaffirm his own self-which
he does in an overblown, empty, and arrogant manner. [Nietzsche\'s four
negations - those of nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, and the cult of
the state-also explain why he was bound to have opposed fascism and
Nazism]{.underline}, although these ideologies successfully manipulated
his philosophy for their devious purposes.

# at: aristocratic/hierarchy

**A celebration of excellence is not anti-democratic as long as it is
worthy praise based on the context---Nietzsche's celebration of
aristocratic vales are not about biology.**

**Hatab, 02** (Prospects For A Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be
Nietzscheans, Lawrence J. Hatab, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24
(2002) 132-147, Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Old
Dominion University).

[We can still be \"democratic\" in opening opportunity to all to prove
themselves, without assuming fixed or protected locations of excellence.
Yet we can be \"aristocratic\" in apportioning appropriate judgments of
superiority and inferiority, depending on the context, and thus we can
avoid what Nietzsche took to be the most insidious feature of
egalitarianism, resentment in the face of excellence. We can also borrow
from Nietzsche\'s denial of a substantial self on behalf of a pluralized
sphere of actions]{.underline} (see BGE 19-21) [in order to keep the
contextual apportionment of excellence open both between and within
selves, so as not to slip into any essentialist aristocratic confidences
about superior selves per se]{.underline}. 22 What is helpful to
democratic political philosophy in appropriating a Nietzschean comfort
with stratification is that we are no longer bedeviled by puzzles
surrounding so-called \"democratic elitism.\" Whenever democratic
practice has exhibited unequal distributions of power, authority,
function, or influence, it has seemed to be incompatible with democratic
ideals because equality has usually been the baseline principle defining
democratic life. But [as long as opportunities are open in a democratic
society, a meritocratic, contextual apportionment of different roles and
performances need not seem undemocratic. Such phenomena as
representative government, executive and judicial powers, opinion
leaders, and expertise can be understood as appropriate arrangements in
political practice]{.underline}.

[The Dionysian is \"the triumphant Yes to life beyond death and change;
true life as collective continuation of life through
procreation]{.underline}\" (TI 109). But [this can come only at the cost
of suffering, as the price to be paid for continuous rebirth: \"In the
teaching of the mysteries, pain is sanctified:]{.underline} the \'pains
of childbirth\' sanctify pain in general-all becoming and growing, all
that guarantees the future, postulates pain. . . . All this is contained
in the word Dionysus\" (TI 109). The Dionysian is not simply sexuality
(Nietzsche is not Freud); rather, the repression of sexuality represents
the repression of the \"fearful and questionable\" as such. (Likewise,
Creek tragedies are not simply sexual conflicts, though such conflicts
are often at the core of them.) [Accepting the necessity of pain in a
life of growth and change, setting aside the goal of happines as the
ultimate aim of a human life, is what the Dionysian \"yes\" requires. To
truly embrace becoming at the expense of being means to take pleasure in
the suffering that accompanies the demise of whatever is.]{.underline}
\"The joy of Being is only possible as the joy of appearance\[.\] [The
joy of becoming is only possible in the destruction of the actuality of
\'Beings,\']{.underline} the beautiful visions, in the pessimistic
annihilation of illusions. \[I\]n the destruction also of beautiful
illusions, Dionysian joy appears as its climax\" (KGW 8.1.114). [The
Dionysian \"yes\" is not a matter of taking a sadistic pleasure in the
suffering of others. Rather, it is a decision to value the future over
the present. To be glad that ours is a world of becoming, rather than
being, means to be glad that things are always changing, that the future
is always coming and the present always passing away.]{.underline} It
means detachment from whatever exists at present-something that will
inevitably appear as callousness towards others: \"Dionysian wisdom. Joy
in the destruction of the most noble and at the sight of its progressive
ruin: in reality joy in what is coming and lies in the future, which
triumphs over existing things, however good\" (WP 417). This is what
Nietzsche had in mind by such phrases as \"amor fati\" or eternal
recurrence. Not the idea that we must relive the past again and again,
but rather that this pattern of destruction and creation is unalterable
and must be borne. And it cannot be withstood by means of faith in
progress. [We must learn to hope in the absence of an expectation of
progress.]{.underline} If this sounds almost nonsensical to the modern
ear, perhaps it is because we have been told for so long that progress
is the rational thing to hope for[. While no element of our life is
unalterable, suffering is the unalterable price to be paid for changing
it. It is this condition that we have no choice but to accept as a whole
or to reject through the hypocrisy of optimism]{.underline}.25 In a
famous note, Nietzsche embodies the two choices as \"Dionysus and the
Crucified\": \"The problem is that of the meaning of suffering: whether
a Christian meaning or a tragic meaning.\" We can surely struggle to
alter those elements of life within our purview, but we will still be
faced with the larger question where we cannot pick and choose. One
alternative is to reject life, and its afflictions, as a whole: \"The
god on the cross is a curse on life, a signpost to seek redemption from
life.\" The other is to embrace life, with all the suffering entailed,
both for ourselves and for others: \"Dionysus cut to pieces is a promise
of life: it will be eternally reborn and return again from destruction\"
(WP 1052). [If one accepts the pessimistic assessment of the world as a
place of chaos and dissonance, one faces the choice of retreating from
it wholesale or embracing it and trying to \"let a harmony sound forth
from every conflict\"]{.underline} (WP 852).

all the decadent elements within European culture? Did the Nazis not
draw some inspiration from his shattering of all moral taboos, his
radical, experimental style of thinking, and his apocalyptic visions of
the future? Certainly, there were National Socialists who tried to
integrate Nietzsche into the straitjacket of their ideology and
exploited his dangerous notion of degeneration. But without its
biological racism and anti-Semitism, the Nazi worldview had no real
cohesion and Nietzsche was as fierce a critic of these aberrations as
one can imagine. Moreover, his so-called immoralism, with its
[questioning of all dogmas and established values, was hardly the basis
on which fascist, Nazi, or other totalitarian regimes consolidated their
support. On the contrary, such regimes, however radical their
intentions, were careful to appeal to conventional morality and
nationalist feelings in order to broaden their following, just as they
often paid lip service to democratic values in order better to destroy
them. Nietzsche\'s skeptical outlook, with its love of ambivalence,
ambiguity, and paradox, was far removed from such manipulations, which
he could only have despised and abhorred]{.underline}. Certainly,
Nietzsche was a disturbing thinker whose ideas will always remain open
to a diversity of interpretations. He was no admirer of modernity or of
the liberal vision of progress, nor was he a \"humanist\" in the
conventional sense of that term. His work lacked a concrete social
anchor and his solution to the problem of nihilism led to a cul-de-sac.
But [to hold Nietzsche responsible, even indirectly, for Auschwitz, is

Nietzsche, Arendt and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International
Relations Theory", Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 25

Realism The notion that [Realism]{.underline} is a highly normative
perspective is contentious statement in contemporary IR theory,.16
Although no longer a Morgenthau postulates the existence of
\'objective\' laws of politics, this [is only possible through a series
of normative manoeuvres which take the state as the ultimate realisation
of political interaction]{.underline}. By accepting that human nature is
characterised by a lust for power which creates danger for individual
(and later state) survival, Morgenthau follows an essentially Hobbesian
conception of the justification of domestic politics.37 The
establishment of civil society through the rule of law and centralised
state power is viewed as a necessary result of human nature. As such,
Morgenthau accepts the state as a self-evident goal, because only its
hierarchical rule can tame \'natural\' conflict and ensure survival and
security. This normative bias is also betrayed in the work of Kenneth
Waltz, his strenuous claim to objectivity notwithstanding. In fact,
Waltz\'s claim to objectivity is conspicuous for the fact that it
implicitly privileges the status quo (the state) by default. Waltz\'s
theory of anarchy, however, also seems to suggest a more assertive moral
framework. Insofar as he views anarchy as a uniform consequence of the
existence of autonomous units,J8 it seems clear that Waltz merely adopts
his own reading of Rousseau\'s state of nature to justify the normative
primacy of the state. In other words, [Waltz justifies the moral
legitimacy of the state simply by assuming that it is the only effective
form of civil society that can mitigate the logic of anarchy by ensuring
hierarchical control]{.underline}. Waltz thus replaces Morgenthau \'s
embarrassing assumptions about power with the sanitised notion of
structural self-interest, while continuing to justify the state in terms
of hierarchical security. In both cases, [the domestic order is
privileged because \'progress and perfection\',]{.underline} or at least
the mitigation of the state of nature[, is assumed to be possible only
through control and rule. This conception appears coherent only because
non-order,]{.underline} understood as the lack of hierarchical rule[, is
a priori defined as a state of nature/conflict. It is only by a
perfectly circular tautology, then, that realism manages to privilege
the state. Once anarchy is defined as dangerous, politics can be
conceptualised only as a process of fabrication through which a secure
community is forged by rule and control. Moreover, once
security/community is understood in these terms, the logic can only
circulate back and reinforce the understanding of political action as
mastery and control over human affairs through the authority or violence
of rulership]{.underline}. When considering international relations,
then, it is completely consistent for realism to label \'the
international\' as anarchic and thus dangerous because it is beyond
control. Yet, because realism has previously defined non-order as
inherently dangerous to survival, the drive for state security compels
the attempt to impose order on the international realm. In a sense, the
international must seem both political (a space in need of hierarchical
control) and apolitical (a space beyond hierarchical control). [This
dichotomy leads to the double strategy of realism as (1) the attempt to
impose order on the international through \'reasoned foreign policy\'
and power, while (2) retreating into the normative value of the state,
and its circular normative justification of domestic order and state
survival.]{.underline}

# at: utilitarianism

**The quest for utility based on supposed scientific truth about the
world is utterly nihilistic---we need to wrestle with why we are on such
a quest before blindly committing to that path.**

**Saurette 96** ("\'I Mistrust all Systematizers and Avoid Them\':
Nietzsche, Arendt and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International
Relations Theory", Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 25
i. 1, March 1996

Paul)

The very logic of the Will to Order, \'Christian morality itself, the
concept of truthfulness taken more and more strictly\' ,56 leads to the
dawn of its self overcoming. [Science is one of the latest phases
of]{.underline} its [\[Will to Truth\] evolution,]{.underline} one of
its terminal forms and inner consequences-it is the awe-inspiring
catastrophe of two thousand years of training in truthfulness that
finally forbids itself the lie involved in belief in God! 57 [By
challenging the truthfulness of God, the scientific Will to Truth
undermines the very dichotomy between the Real World and the Apparent
World. Science, however, is]{.underline} not an overcoming of the Will
to Truth, but [merely the most complete, empty, and nihilistic ascetic
ideal. It refutes \'faith\' but retains an unquestioned belief in
itself.]{.underline} Although science claims to follow no authority, its
\'unconditional will to truth is faith in the ascetic ideal itself, even
if as an unconscious imperative\... it is the faith in a metaphysical
value, the absolute value of truth\' .58 [The scientific Will to Truth
is both the most advanced and the most dangerous manifestation of the
Will to Order/Truth, because]{.underline} in spite of its disavowal of
the Christian dichotomised world[, it retains a belief in Truth without
attaching any value or meaning to existence]{.underline}.59 With the
rise of science, then, the sole virtue of the Christian Will to
Truth/Order, the\' faith in the dignity and uniqueness of man, in his
irreplaceability in the great chain of being, \[becomes\] a thing of the
past. Man has become an animal, literally and without reservation or
qualification\'.6O The radical scepticism of science is the \'suicidal
nihilism\' of the late-modern age, \'affirming as little as it
denies\'.\" It is the process by which all such \'transcendent\' grounds
are dissolved in a corrosive scepticism: the true world becomes a fable.
The central value of our culture-truth-drives us towards ceaseless
unmasking. The irony, as Tracy Strong observes, is that [this discovery
does not liberate us from the sense that we must have truth in order to
have meaning,]{.underline} that meaning is somehow inextricably tied to
truth or the universal. [We continue to search for what we know does not
exist, confirming our growing sense of meaninglessness]{.underline};
worse, we come to be at home in this exhaustion of meaning.62
Ironically, then, Nietzsche suggests that [it is precisely the nihilism
of scientific faith which pushes man \'onto an inclined
plane-]{.underline}now he is [slipping faster and faster]{.underline}
away from the centre [into-]{.underline}what? into
[nothingness]{.underline}? into a penetrating sense of nothingness\' .63
[The danger of the late-modern nihilistic Will to Truth is that this
reactive \'will to negation\', while yearning for a truthful foundation,
can only destroy and negate. Even]{.underline} anthropocentric
recreations of authoritative Truth, such as [faith in progress,
utilitarian happiness-for-everyone, socialist utopias, or Kant\'s
secularised teleologies, cannot survive the scrutiny of this nihilistic
Will to Truth.]{.underline} As Michael Haar notes, \[a\]fter having
killed God-i.e. [after having recognized the nothingness of the \'true
world\'-and after having placed himself where God once was, Man
continues to be haunted by his iconoclastic act: he cannot venerate
himself, and soon ends up by turning his impiety against himself and
smashing this new idol]{.underline}.64 [The radical and untempered
scepticism of scientific Will to Truth undermines the foundational
meanings of the modern world and thus threatens modern life with the
prospect of unconditional nihilism.]{.underline}

# at: utilitarianism

**Utilitarianism is simply a re-working of Judeo-Christian morality --
it prioritizes the herd over the individual.**

**Warren, 88** (Mark, Professor at the University of British Colombia,
[Nietzsche and Political Thought,]{.underline} MIT Press)

[If Nietzsche is not interested in ethical rules]{.underline} so much as
in the conceptions of agency they presuppose, [one would think that he
would have been well-disposed toward the utilitarian attempt to evaluate
practices in terms of their benefits for the self]{.underline}. After
all, utilitarianism breaks down the Christian polarity between the
demands of the self and what is good, between morality and life. But
[one finds little praise of utilitarianism in Nietzsche\'s
writings]{.underline}. Part of [the reason is that utilitarianism embeds
a metaphysics of moral agency in its concept of the
\"ego,\"]{.underline} and it is [this metaphysics]{.underline} that is
[expanded into notions of general welfare.]{.underline} Nietzsche\'s
argument is that [the utilitarian self is not given as a fact, but must
itself be explained as the result of a specific historical organization
of power. Utilitarianism in effect takes over and simply reevaluates the
Christian \"false dogmatism regarding the \'ego\']{.underline}: it is
taken in the atomistic sense, in a false antithesis to the \'nonego\';
at the same time, pried out of becoming, as something that has being.\"
38 This is why [\"the \'welfare of the individual\' is just as imaginary
as the \'welfare of the species\': the former is *not* sacrificed to the
latter]{.underline}; \[the\] species viewed from a distance is just as
transient as the individual.\" 39 Nietzsche\'s point, as we saw in
chapter 2, is that the powers, capabilities, and needs of agents become
something \"individual\" through an incorporation of historical
experiences, culture, and language. Insofar as moral judgments attribute
selfhood to individuals, they as much constitute individuals as they
flow from them. [What utilitarianism really does]{.underline}, then[, is
read interests of general welfare]{.underline} (\"the happiness of
*Rngland,\"* as Nietzsche puts it) [onto the individual]{.underline}. In
this way, it [usurps the good of the individual into the good of
society]{.underline} -precisely [the opposite of what its proponents
intend]{.underline}.

**Blind faith in empiricism ignores the social and political context in
which truths are created. Nietzschean skepticism is a necessary
corrective.**

The perspectival nature of justification helps us understand
Nietzsche\'s ambivalent attitude toward the science of his day (for
additional analyses of Nietzsche\'s relation to science, see, among
others, [Clark

It is certainly true that science is preferable to many other
perspectives---religion and morality in particular---but [Nietzsche has
a number of complaints about science that entail that it cannot be
uniquely privileged over every other kind of knowledge]{.underline}. One
criticism is directed against scientists themselves, focusing on their
character flaws. [Scientists myopically root around in their
specialties,]{.underline} digging \"quietly under their molehills\" (*D*
41), [blissfully uncritical about the value of their work and never
connecting it to the larger personal and social contexts in which it
occurs]{.underline}. This trait distinguishes scientists from
philosophers, for whom nothing is impersonal (*BGE* 6). A second, more
serious complaint is that [scientists are ascetics]{.underline}. The
ascetic ideal is a kind of self-mortifying decadence. Nietzsche argues
in *GM* that [the unquestioned faith in the value of truth found in
science makes truth a stand-in divinity for God]{.underline} after he
has died. [Truth becomes the object to which all sacrifices must be
made]{.underline}; hence, scientists are humble in the face of the
truth, and by suppressing their desires in order to devote their lives
to their research, their labs, and their books, they live a life of
chastity and poverty, reminiscent of priests. Thus is the practice of
science a practical asceticism. Nietzsche also complains about science
itself. It is, for example, mistakenly governed by a set of mechanistic
principles that are false (see, for example, *GS* 373). Now, to the
extent that science reduces to mechanism, to that extent this criticism
is sound. However, one might think that since mechanism was more
widespread in the nineteenth century than it is now, this criticism is
not as relevant now as then. But this glib response misses [Nietzsche\'s
more trenchant objection, which is to reductionism in science, the view
that we can identify fundamental categories and explain everything in
terms of them]{.underline} (see especially [Cox
1998](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v037/37.welshon.html#b8)).
If anything, reductionism in science has accelerated since the
nineteenth century. If you doubt it, simply review the last hundred
years of psychology. Until the so-called cognitive revolution in the
1960s, the most widespread theoretical framework in psychology was
reductionist behaviorism, according to which the domain of psychology
was exhausted by observable behavior. Behaviorism was in turn replaced
by computationalism, according to which all cognition was a kind of
computation. Computationalism is now also thought by most to be false,
since computers are qualitative zombies and we are not. There is
*something* that *our* psychology has---phenomenological character to
our experiences---that computers lack. But we still have not learned the
Nietzschean lesson, for there are now two new reductionist trends in
psychology: cognitive neuroscience, according to which a psychological
phenomenon is reducible to neural activity, and evolutionary psychology,
according to which a psychological phenomenon is reducible to survival
value. Again, [Nietzsche\'s larger point that science is routinely
blinkered and self-interested seems to be forgotten again and
again]{.underline}.

**Wolin has an overly simplistic read of Nietzsche and fails to support
his claims.**

**Rorty 04** (Richard, Former Professor Emeritus @ Stanford U., June 14,
2004, "A Review: The Seduction of Unreason,"
\[http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/wolin.htm\])

[Wolin has an easy time showing that fans of Nietzsche and Heidegger
have said stupid and irresponsible things about democracy. But he does
not do much to show that the stupidities follow from their philosophies,
nor that those philosophies are untenable. To do the latter, he would
have to argue in defense of specific philosophical claims\--those that
constitute what he thinks of as democracy's \"normative resources.\" He
leaves it pretty vague what a \"normative resource\" might be, and how
such resources are put to use in political deliberation. Postmodernism,
Wolin says, is \"the rejection of the intellectual and cultural
assumptions of modernity]{.underline} in the name of 'will to power'
(Nietzsche), 'sovereignty' (Bataille), an 'other beginning' (Heidegger),
'différance' (Derrida) or a 'different economy of bodies and pleasures'
(Foucault).\" So [one expects him to enumerate \"the intellectual and
cultural assumptions of modernity\" and show why they should not be
rejected.]{.underline} But [Wolin seems to assume that his readers
already know what these assumptions are, and are disposed to take
rejection of them as a reductio ad absurdum of a philosopher's
outlook.]{.underline} Sometimes, however, he goes out on a philosophical
limb, as when he says that Derrida's \"criticism of the modern natural
law tradition\--the normative basis of the contemporary democratic
societies\"\--leaves us with a \"'political existentialism,' in which,
given the 'groundless' nature of moral and political choice, one
political 'decision' seems almost as good as another.\" In such passages
as these, Wolin endorses the old Platonic argument to the effect that if
there is nothing \"out there\" (the Platonic forms, the will of God,
natural law) that makes our moral judgments true, there is no point in
forming such judgments at all.

**Wolin is only able to indict philosophers via guilt by
association---he pays little attention to the actual arguments made.**

**Rorty 04** (Richard, Former Professor Emeritus @ Stanford U., June 14,
2004, "A Review: The Seduction of Unreason,"
\[http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/wolin.htm\])

[Wolin is very good at digging up the dirt on famous European thinkers.
He does a fine job of describing how their doctrines were put to use by
different bad guys at different times\--]{.underline}how, for example,
\"a critique of reason, democracy and humanism that originated on the
German Right during the 1920s was internalized by the French Left.\"
That is an admirable summary of one of the strangest turns in
twentieth-century European intellectual life. But, [though he protests
that his book is \"not an exercise in guilt-by-association,\" that
description is actually pretty close to the mark. Wolin neglects the
question of why the figures he discusses held the views they did in
favor of an account of the uses to which they were put]{.underline}.
[Wolin]{.underline} [thinks]{.underline}, rightly, [that if you
understand the sociopolitical contexts in which a philosophical view was
formulated]{.underline}, and the factors that account for its reception,
[you will be in a better position to decide whether to adopt
it.]{.underline} Still, [the best sort of intellectual history is the
kind that pays equal attention to the company a philosophical doctrine
keeps and to the arguments deployed in its defense]{.underline}.

# at: but our ethic is universal

**Conflict about ethics proves that there are no universal norms.**

**Franke 2000** (Mark F.N., Instructor of International Studies at the
University of Northern British Columbia, \"Refusing an Ethical Approach
to World Politics in Favour of Political Ethics,\" European Journal of
International Relations 6(3) p. 310)

The grounds that propel International Relations and, consequently, the
general concern of international ethics themselves, though, are surely
not of an ethical character per se. International Relations and the
considerations of ethics made possible within that vision respond
primarily to the notion that there is no natural structure or code upon
which actions and judgments in human relations may be legitimately
justified in any final sense. No person or group of persons has view to
any thing like what one might call the universal conditions of humanity.
[Each is limited to particular perspectives and cultural mappings of how
a human universe may appear if local understandings could be extended
globally. It is for this reason that persons are said to be naturally in
a state of war with each other]{.underline}. 5 In trying to orient
themselves to one another and the things that come of interest to them
via experience and reports of the experiences of others, humans run
inevitably into a cartographic crisis with one another, a crisis
regarding how each ought to orient her and himself to others. Even prior
to any kind of base power struggle that Realists may attribute to them,
people come into a conflict of ideas and representations of what the
world of experience might be. The multiple images that different humans
may project or adopt in trying to understand the potential range of
their respective interests and movements share no natural grounds in
common. [There is no one place, life or vision in which all humans
commonly partake]{.underline}. [The world of humans is therefore
anarchical]{.underline}. But [it is not so because of a selfish nature
identically reproduced in each individual,]{.underline} as the
metaphysicists of Realism/Idealism proclaim. [Rather this 'world' is
anarchical due to the fact that there is never actually a single world
to which all ideas of human life may be justifiably created]{.underline}
from this variety of views. Instead, humans, by the fact of being
particular and finite beings unable to see all things and enjoy all
possible lives at once, give rise to unlimited numbers and kinds of
principles upon which unending worlds may be founded and demanded. [Only
one universally applicable social fact must then be said to confront
each and every possible person, that an ethics is not
av]{.underline}ailable by nature. There are at [least no grounds upon
which such an ethics may be assumed possible.]{.underline}

# AFF: at: no value to life

**Securing life is a prerequisite to determining value.**

**Schwartz, 02** (Lisa, Medical Ethics,
<http://www.fleshandbones.com/readingroom/pdf/399.pdf>)

The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a
criterion for decision- making is closely related to the first, but with
an added dimension. This assertion suggests that [the determination of
the value of the quality of a given life is a subjective determi-nation
to be made by the person experiencing that life]{.underline}. The
important addition here is that [the decision is a personal one
that]{.underline}, ideally[, ought not to be made externally by another
person but internally by the individual involved]{.underline}. Katherine
Lewis made this decision for herself based on a comparison between two
stages of her life. So did James Brady. Without this element, decisions
based on quality of life criteria lack salient information and the
patients concerned cannot give informed consent. [Patients must be given
the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they think their lives
are worth living or not. To ignore or overlook patients' judgement in
this matter is to violate their autonomy and their freedom to decide for
themselves]{.underline} on the basis of relevant informa- tion about
their future, and comparative con- sideration of their past. As the
deontological position puts it so well, [to do so is to violate the
imperative that we must treat persons as rational and as ends in
themselves]{.underline}.

**Turn\--elevating other values over extinction destroys the value to
life and makes extinction certain---their representation that they know
the absolute truth of the value to life makes it easier to end it**

**Schell, 82** (Jonathan, writer for the New Yorker and nuclear weapons
expert, [The Fate of the Earth)]{.underline}

For the generations that now have to decide whether or not to risk the
future of the species, the implication of our species' unique place in
the order of things is that [while things in]{.underline} the
[life]{.underline} of mankind [have worth, we must never raise that
worth above]{.underline} the life of mankind and above [our respect
for]{.underline} that [life's existence. To do this would be to make of
our highest ideals so many swords with which to destroy ourselves. To
sum up the worth of our species by reference to some
particular]{.underline} standard, goal, or [ideology, no matter
how]{.underline} elevated or [noble]{.underline} it might be, [would be
to prepare the way for extinction by closing down in thought and feeling
the open-ended possibilities for human development which extinction
would close down in fact.]{.underline} There is only one circumstance in
which it might be possible to sum up the life and achievement of the
species, and that circumstance would be that it had already died, but
then, of course, there would be no one left to do the summing up. [Only
a generation that believed itself to be in possession of final, absolute
truth could ever conclude that it had reason to put an end to human
life, and only generations that recognized the limits to their own
wisdom and virtue would be likely to subordinate their interests and
dreams to the as yet unformed interests and undreamed dreams of the
future generations, and let human life go on.]{.underline}

# AFF: cede the political links 

**Nietzsche's affirmation of chaos is willful abandonment of all
reason---we become mere pawns of fate, reduced to silence.**

**Wolin, 06** (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with
Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, Professor of
History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City
University).

[Once Nietzsche realized the illusory character of all language and
human ends, silence became the only viable and honest response. Recourse
to \"consciousness\" and \"reason\" would only falsify this profound
realization]{.underline}. The \"vicious circle\" Klossowski alludes to
in his title expresses this dilemma. The act of turning the eternal
return into a \"doctrine\" risks falsifying it, risks translating an
unfathomable insight into the hackneyed terms of linguistic convention
or \"culture.\" The theory of eternal recurrence embodies a new
\"lucidity\"; yet, paradoxically, this lucidity must remain
inexpressible. For if such a lucidity is impossible, what the doctrine
of the vicious Circle tends to demonstrate is that \"belief\" in the
Return, adherence to the non-sense of life, in itself implies an
otherwise impracticable lucidity. We cannot renounce language, nor our
intentions, nor our willing; but we could evaluate this willing and
these intentions in a different manner than we have hitherto evaluated
them-namely, as subject to the \"law\" of the vicious Circle. [The
vicious circle expresses the fundamental paradox of the human condition:
\"the only way we can overcome our servitude is by knowing we are not
free." We cannot escape the essential determinism of all being.
Nevertheless, insight into this condition permits a measure of tragic
superiority for a spiritual elite]{.underline}, the \"lucid few.\" [The
anti-intellectual implications]{.underline} of Klossowski\'s \"parody\"
[of Nietzsche are stunning. They are tantamount to a willful abandonment
of reason, history, and freedom.]{.underline}

**Nietzsche's radical skepticism is nihilistic because to give up on the
rules of logic is to abandon critical thinking.**

**Comte- Sponville 91** (Andre, Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne.
"The Brute, the Sophist, and the Aesthete "Art in the Service of
Illusion*"*, *Why We are Not Nietzscheans*).

But [Nietzsche cannot]{.underline} then [escape from the aporia of
logical nihilism: if there is no truth, the proposition that states that
there is no truth is not true. We must therefore conclude either that
there is a truth (in which case the proposition \"there is no truth\" is
false, and Nietzsche is mistaken), or that we cannot think at all any
more (since the proposition \"there is no truth\" is simultaneously true
and false, which violates the principle of noncontradiction, or neither
true nor false, which transgresses the principle of the excluded
third]{.underline}). In a word: we have either to save logic and give up
Nietzsche or to save Nietzsche and give up on logic. The genealogists
may ask us: \"Why are you so attached to logic?\" We have our reasons,
to which I will come back. But we also have to return the question to
them: and you, why are you so little attached to it? Nietzsche claims
that attachment to logic is a sign of weakness, that it betrays a
plebian or Jewish origin (WP, 431 ff.; GS, 348, 370). Should we then
conclude that every illogicality is a sign of aristocratic or Aryan
force? Or would this conclusion be itself too logical? Too plebeian? Too
Jewish? Or are logic and genealogy legitimate only when corning from
Nietzschean pens? But let\'s leave that aside. Another, more solid
objection that could be made against me is that the aporia I have just
evoked (the self contradiction of logical nihilism) is that of any
radical skepticism, and that I can\'t take Nietzsche to task for it more
than I would Pyrrhon, Montaigne, or Hume, whom I nevertheless profess to
admire.

[If I had no morality]{.underline}, as I so haughtily claimed, [then in

sweetness to cruelty? [For a time I tried to answer: \"In the name of an

for a while. This ethic still had to be thought out, and the strange
fact accounted for that a supposedly amoral ethic most often corresponds
quite well, and this on all the serious problems, to what any honest man
would call morality]{.underline}. So I took up my Spinoza again, and
what I saw there is that there is no Spinozist immoralism, or rather
only a theoretical immoralism, and that . . . but let\'s get back to
Nietzsche. There is a Nietzschean immoralism, not only theoretical but
practical, and the more I got to know it, the more I found it-I barely

**Fasching, 93** - professor in USF\'s religious studies department --
1993 (Darrell, [The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima :
Apocalypse or Utopia?,]{.underline} Pg. 28)

[Our modern technological civilization offers us seemingly infinite
utopian opportunities to recreate ourselves (e.g., genetic engineering,
behavioral engineering) and our societies (social engineering) and our
world (chemical engineering, atomic engineering). But having transcended
all limits and all norms, we seem bereft of a normative vision to govern
the use of our utopian techniques. This normlessness threatens us with
demonic self-destruction. It is this dark side of technical civilization
that was revealed to us not only at Auschwitz and but also at
Hiroshima.]{.underline} Auschwitz represents a severe challenge to the
religious traditions of the West: to Christians, because of the
complicity of Christianity in the anti-Judaic path that led to Auschwitz
renders its theological categories ethically suspect; to Jews, because
their victim status presses faith in the God of history and in humanity
to the breaking point. But the path to Auschwitz, and from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima, represents a challenge, equally severe, for the scientific
and technical, secular culture of the Enlightenment. We do not seem to
have fared any better under a secular ethic than we did under a
religious one. Indeed we have fared worse. Genocide it seems is a unique
product of the modern secular world and its technically competent
barbarians. Auschwitz stands for a demonic period in modern Western
civilization in which the religious, political and technological
developments converged to create a society whose primary purpose was the
most efficient organization of that entire society for the purpose of
exterminating all persons who were regarded as aliens and
strangers---especially the Jews. [The Nazi vision of the pure Aryan
society represents a utopian vision of demonic proportions---a vision
that inspired an apocalyptic revolutionary program of genocide. It
reveals at once both a time of \"The Death of God\" in the Nietzschean
sense and yet the resurgence of religion]{.underline}, that is, a
demonic religiosity that creates a new public order in which all
pluralism is eliminated from the public square and in which virtually
nothing is sacred---not even human life. [The period of the Holocaust
stands as prophetic warning to a technological civilization that has no
other norm than the *will to power*]{.underline}. If Auschwitz embodies
the demonic use of technology against targeted populations to commit
genocide, Hiroshima and Nagasaki represent the last such use of
technology. [For with the coming of Nuclear warfare, technology has
outstripped human intentionality so that if the bomb is ever used again,
genocide will be transformed into collective suicide or *omnicide*---the
destruction of all life. Having enemies is a luxury no community on the
face of the earth can any longer afford]{.underline}

[How might one translate the conviction that hierarchy is beneficial and
equality symptomatic of weakness-beliefs Nietzsche held-into the terms
of a consistent political ethos]{.underline}? This was the dilemma
confronting Nietzsche as a political philosopher, and the solution he
found was an endorsement of \"great politics.\" [His belief in the
necessity of hierarchy had profound political implications, which found
expression in his conviction that the \"well-being of the majority and
the well-being of the few are opposite viewpoints of value.\" If one

[one couldn\'t shy away from drawing the necessary conclusions, harsh as
they might seem from a humanitarian point of view]{.underline}.

power and artist tyrants will be made to endure for
millennia]{.underline} . In Ecce Homo Nietzsche openly speculates on
what a \"successful\" realization of his doctrines (\"my attempt to
assassinate two millennia of antinature and human disfiguration\") might
mean. [The scenario he envisions cannot but make one shudder: \"That
higher Party of Life which would take the greatest of all tasks into its
hands, the higher breeding of humanity, including the merciless
extermination]{.underline} \[Vernichtung\] [of everything
degenerate]{.underline} and parasitical, would make possible again that
excess of life on earth from which the Dionysian state will grow
again.\"

**Nietzsche's celebration of cruelty, violence, and authoritarianism are
cornerstones of his philosophy.**

**Wolin, 06** - Professor of History and Comparative Literature at City
University (Richard, The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance
with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism).

Ironically, [whereas an earlier generation of critics took Nietzsche\'s
philosophy to task for its repugnant political message, the postmodern
approach is fond of celebrating his apoliticism. But no special
interpretive talent is needed to see that the remarks just quoted, far
from being \"apolitical,\" are fraught with political directives and
implications]{.underline}. The postmodernists exaggerate Nietzsche\'s
status as an aesthete and systematically downplay the components of his
work that are politically consequential. Nietzsche was, admittedly, an
unrelenting critic of contemporary European politics, which in his
estimation wreaked of mediocrity and conformity. But that hardly makes
him an apolitical thinker. [Instead, Nietzsche\'s unabashed embrace of
hierarchy, violence, and the virility of the \"warrior type,\" combined
with his visceral distaste for the values of altruism and political
egalitarianism, suggests that his doctrines foreshadowed]{.underline}
nolm volens [some of the more unsavory dimensions of twentieth-century
Machtpolitik cum total war. Any serious attempt to reassess Nietzsche\'s
philosophical legacy must ultimately confront the distasteful character
of his moral and political views]{.underline}. Conversely, any
discussion of Nietzsche that focused exclusively on this aspect of his
thought would be extremely limited. Nietzsche\'s influence on modern
thought and literature has been incalculable. Writers as diverse as
Rillre, Yeats, Valery, D. H. Lawrence, and George Bernard Shaw embraced
his teachings. In Doctor Faustus Thomas Mann used Nietzsche as the model
for the composer Adrian Leverkiihn. For a period of five years during
the late 1930s Martin Heidegger lectured exclusively on Nietzsche.
Perhaps the writer Gottfried Benn said it best when in the late 1940s he
observed to a friend, \"Really, you know, \[Nietzsche\] has anticipated
and formulated everything, absolutely everything we poke around in-what
else have we done these last fifty years but trot out and vulgarize his
gigantic thoughts and suffering.\" His stylistic brilliance aside, no
other writer articulated the spiritual disorientation of fin-de-siecle
Europe as consummately as Nietzsche. As a cultural analyst, a
diagnostician of European moral collapse, his acumen was unparalleled. A
self-described \"good European,\" he sensed, in a manner that was almost
uncanny, the abyss toward which Europe was uncontrollably heading. Who
could deny the preternatural clairvoyance of the following prophetic
claim from Ecce Homo: When the truth enters into a fight with the lies
of millennia, we shall have upheavals, a convulsion of earthquakes, the
like of which has never been dreamed of. . . . The concept of politics
will have merged entirely with a war of spirits; all power structures of
the old society will have been exploded.. . There will be wars the like
of which have never yet been on earth. It is only beginning with me that
the earth knows great politic. No one gave voice to the dilemmas of
European nihilism with as much force and clarity as Nietzsche. He
realized that the religious, moral, and political values that had been
the mainstay of the old Europe were moribund and that the new values
destined to supplant them had not yet arisen. Nietzsche viewed himself
as the midwife of these new values. But he was also aware that he was a
man ahead of his time. As a prophet of nihilism, Nietzsche recognized
that Europe had lost its moral compass, that it was ethically adrift. In
the opening sections of The Will to Power, he offered a succinct
definition of nihilism, \"The highest values devaluate themselves. The
aim is lacking; \'why?\' finds no answer.\" With the advent of the
modern age, condemned to labor in the shadow of Zarathustra\'s chilling
proclamation concerning the death of God, Europe had seemingly begun an
irreversible course of existential meaninglessness. [In Nietzsche\'s
view, its only salvation lay with the birth of the
Superman]{.underline}. As Nietzsche proclaims in The Will to Power: In
opposition to the dwarfing and adaptation of man to a specialized
utility, a reverse movement is needed-the production of a synthetic,
summarizing, justifying man for whose existence the transformation of
mankind into a machine is a precondition, as a base on which he can
invent his higher form of being. . . . A dominating race can grow up
only out of terrible and violent beginnings. Where are the barbarians of
the twentieth century? The answer to Nietzsche\'s provocative question
would soon materialize. Was Nietzsche really apolitical? Though he
mercilessly criticized the dominant political movements of his day[, he
was also a tireless advocate of \"great politics,\" a veritable
leitmotif of his later writings. For Nietzsche, cultural and political
greatness were necessary corollaries.]{.underline} Not only was he an
enthusiast of Homer, Goethe, and Wagner; [he was also a profound admirer
of Julius Caesar, Cesare Borgia, and Napoleon]{.underline}. In many
respects, his reflections on \"great politics\" were as coherent and
systematic as his musings on cultural and philosophical themes. \"The
time for petty politics is over,\" Nietzsche confidently announces in
Beyond Good and Evil; \"the very next century will bring the fight for
the dominion of the earth-the compulsion to great politics.\" Here, too,
Nietzsche\'s orientation was shaped by his training in the classics.
Surveying the world of antiquity, the West\'s unsurpassed cultural
pinnacle, he concluded that a hierarchical organization of society and
politics was entirely natural. He subscribed to his University of Base1
colleague Jacob Burckhardt\'s opinion that the rise of democracy had
precipitated Athens\' downfall. One of the most felicitous descriptions
of his political orientation was provided by his Danish admirer, Georg
Brandes, who spoke of Nietzsche\'s \"aristocratic radicalism\"-a
characterization that Nietzsche M y approved of. Aristocracy means
\"rule of the best.\" [In Nietzsche\'s view, it was only natural that
\"the best-the strongest and most powerful natures-should rule-and rule
ruthlessly. As he remarks]{.underline} in The Genealogy of Morals, \"To
expect that strength will not manifest itself as strength, as the desire
to overcome, to appropriate, to have enemies . . . is every bit as
absurd as to expect that weakness will manifest itself as strength. . .
. [No act of violence, rape, exploitation, destruction, is intrinsically
\'unjust,\' since life itself is violent, rapacious, exploitative, and
destructive]{.underline}.\" Only the Judeo-Christian \"slave revolt\" in
ethics had dared to assume otherwise, insidiously turning the tables on
the masters by declaring that strength was evil and weakness good.
[Nietzsche viewed democracy as merely the political corollary of the
pusillanimous Christian view that all persons were equal in the eyes of
God.]{.underline}

**If there is no truth, then there is no means of resisting lies---we

[If there is no truth, how are you going to resist lies]{.underline}?
What would be the sense of asking, for instance, whether Dreyfus was

interpretation by certain historians connected to the Jewish lobby? It
may be objected that that was not Nietzsche\'s point of view. Certainly,
those were not his examples. As for his point of view, I wouldn\'t know.
In The Antichrist, after having praised Pontius Pilate\'s attitude
(\"One Jew more or less-what does it matter?\"), Nietzsche adds: The
noble scorn of a Roman, confronted with an impudent abuse of the word
\"truth,\" has enriched the New Testament with the only saying *that has
value* one which is its criticism, even its *annihilation:* \"What is
truth?\". [Indeed, any judge can say that when he needs to condemn an
innocent man. But can we accept that? Should we accept it? And how do we
prevent it, if there are neither facts nor truths? In]{.underline}
aphorism of [Beyond Good and Evil, after having announced, you will
recall, that the falseness of a judgment was not for him an objection
against that judgment since the only thing that counts is its vital
utility, Nietzsche concludes: To recognize untruth as a condition of
life-that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a
dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token
alone place itself beyond good and evil. Logic and morality go

**Nietzsche's embracing of disorder necessitates an abandonment of
traditional morality and justifies mass murder**.

**White, 90** (Alan, online book, [Within Nietzsche's
Labyrinth,]{.underline} Professor of Philosophy, Williams College,
<http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/faculty/awhite/WNL%20web/beauty_and_goodness.htm>).

Nietzsche exhorts us to live beautifully; on this point, Nehamas and I
agree. A second point of our agreement is in at­tributing [to
Nietzsche]{.underline} an insistence that [the assessment of a specific
life\'s beauty is a matter, primarily, for the individual living that
life. From these teachings a serious problem emerges: if beauty is the
criterion for goodness, and if there are no universal criteria for
beauty, is there anything to prevent the mass murderer and the child
molester on the one hand, or the couch potato on the other, from viewing
their lives as beautiful, and thus as good]{.underline} \-- even as
ideal? This question leads me to one of Nehamas\'s central concerns:
\"Nietzsche is clearly much more concerned with the question of how
one\'s ac­tions are to fit together into a coherent, self-sustaining,
well-motivated whole than he is with the quality of those actions
them­selves\" (166); for this reason, \"the uncomfortable feeling
per­sists that someone might achieve Nietzsche\'s ideal life and still be
nothing short of repugnant\" (167). This uncomfortable feeling arises,
for Nehamas, from the teaching that life is literature. According to
Nehamas\'s Nietzsche, \"one should not take one\'s misdeeds seriously
for long, \[because\] virtue does not depend on *what* one does but on
*whether* what one does is an expression of one\'s whole self, of one\'s
\'own will.\'\" This position makes sense, Nehamas adds, because \"these
are exactly the considerations that are relevant to [the evaluation of
literary
characters](http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/faculty/awhite/WNL%20web/Beauty%20notes.htm#Literary%20lives)\"
(166). Literature, many of us would agree, would be much the poorer if
it contained none of what my children refer to as \"bad guys\"; evil
literary characters are often intriguing and fascinating characters, and
thus, we might agree, \"good\" characters; works of literature
containing evil, corrupt, and malicious characters are often good
literary works. Evil lives often make good litera­ture; what then if life
is literature? A version of the same question arises for Proust\'s
Marcel, who sees the possibility only of a Platonistic answer.
Reflect­ing on Bergotte\'s death, he writes:He was dead. Dead forever?
Who can say? Certainly, experiments in spiritualism offer us no more
proof than the dogmas of religion that the soul survives death. All that
we can say is that every­thing is arranged in this life as though we
entered it carrying a burden of obligations contracted in a former life;
there is no reason inherent in the conditions of life on this earth that
can make us consider ourselves obliged to do good, to be kind and
thoughtful, even to be polite, nor for an atheist artist to con­sider
himself obliged to begin over again a score of times a piece of work the
admiration aroused by which will matter little to his worm-eaten body,
like the patch of yellow wall painted with so much skill and refinement
by an artist destined to be forever unknown and barely identified under
the name Vermeer. All these obliga­tions, which have no sanction in our
present life, seem to belong to a different world, a world based on
kindness, scrupulousness, self-sacrifice, a world entirely different
from this one and which we leave in order to be born on this earth,
before perhaps return­ing there to live once again beneath the sway of
those unknown laws which we obeyed because we bore their precepts in our
hearts, not knowing whose hand had traced them there \-- those laws to
which every profound work of the intellect brings us nearer and which
are invisible only \-- if then! \-- to fools. So that the idea that
Ber­gotte was not permanently dead is by no means improbable.
(III:186) Why should we \"do good,\" why should \"be kind and
thoughtful,\" why should we be even polite? Why should we strive to
create, knowing as we do that the admiration aroused by our creations
will matter little to our worm-eaten bodies? In a man­ner typical of the
Platonistic current in the Western philosophi­cal tradition, Marcel
answers: human obligations to be thought­ful and kind could derive only
from a different world, one \"entirely different from this one.\"
Nietzsche rejects the notion that there are human obligations deriving
from a different world; yet he is not one of Marcel\'s fools. Nehamas
stresses, and I stress, that Nietzsche does not want to take the
position of encouraging sadists and egotists. Unbridled egotism, he
insists, would lead only to \"universal wars of annihilation\"
(*BT*:15). His position is made yet more explicit in a passage quoted
above, but worth repeating: I deny morality as I deny alchemy, that is,
I deny their premises: but I do *not* deny that there have been
alchemists who believed in these premises and acted in accordance with
them. \-- I also deny immorality: *not* that countless people *feel*
themselves to be immoral, but that there is any *true* reason so to
feel. It goes without saying that I do not deny \-- unless I am a fool
\-- that many actions called immoral ought to be avoided and resisted,
or that many called moral ought to be done and encouraged \-- but I
think the one should be encouraged and the other avoided *for other
reasons than hitherto*. (*D*:103) Nietzsche does not want to deny \"that
many actions called immoral ought to be avoided and resisted, and that
many called moral ought to be done and encouraged\"; he agrees with
Marcel that only fools could think otherwise. Yet he rejects
other-worldly sources of obligation; how then can he answer Marcel\'s
questions? What is to be said, or done, to the mass murderer and the
child molester, or to the couch potato? Nehamas responds to this
question on Nietzsche\'s behalf, but his response strikes me as in part
inaccurate and in part dan­gerous, and thus, on the whole, unacceptable.
In responding, Nehamas first suggests that Nietzsche severely restricts
the audience to whom he addresses his transvaluative teachings:
Exemplifying the very attitude that prompts him to reject uncondi­tional
codes, Nietzsche does not reject them unconditionally. His demand is
only that philos­ophers, and not all people, \"take their stand *beyond*
good and evil and leave the illusion of moral judgment *beneath* them\"
(*TI*VII:1) Here, Nehamas suggests that only philosophers \-- who, he
seems to assume, are not \"fools\" of the sort Marcel and Nietzsche are
worried about \-- are to recognize that moral judgment is il­lusory. In
this central respect, Nehamas\'s Nietzsche seems to remain a Platonist:
he tells noble lies to the masses in order to keep them in line,
reserving the truth for the intellectually privileged few. No doubt,
Nietzsche does restrict the scope of some of his teachings; he has
Zarathustra announce, for example, \"It is a dis­grace \[*Schmach*\] to
pray! Not for everyone, but for you and me and whoever else has his
conscience in his head. For *you* it is a disgrace to pray\"
(*Z*III:8.2; 227.27-29). I grant in addition that Nietzsche points
philosophers beyond dogmatic morality; he agrees with Marcel that
nothing on this earth *obliges* us to be thoughtful or kind. Yet even in
the passage Nehamas cites, Nietzsche does not present his teachings to
philosophers alone. And if we distinguish more generally between
esoteric and ex­oteric strains in [Nietzsche\'s]{.underline} teachings,
then his immoralism, his [apparent advocacy of violence and oppression,
must certainly be included among his teachings]{.underline} for the
many. Pace Nehamas, it seems to me that Nietzsche views the reten­tion,
by the many, of the illusion of moral judgment not only as undesirable,
but even as impossible. It is impossible because, he insists, God is
dead, and word of his death is getting around. Christian morality was
maintained only by the fear of hell and the promise of heaven \--
Christian morality works, on a broad scale, only for those who live in
order to be paid (\"great will be your reward in heaven\"); it collapses
with the demise of the celestial paymaster. If God is dead, morality
dies with him, al­though only following a lengthier decline. For this
reason, I reject Nehamas\'s assertion that \"Nietzsche \[\...\] does not
advocate and does not even foresee a radical change in the lives of most
people,\" although I accept a version of the sentence that follows it
immediately: \"The last thing he is is a social reformer or
revolutionary\" (225). Nietzsche is not a \"social reformer or
revolutionary\" in the usual sense in that he does not provide society
with an external impetus for reform or revolution, and in that he
provides no blueprint for a post-Christian social world. He provides
society with no external impetus because there is no need for one;
whether we like it or not, society continues to transform itself \-- as,
history shows us, it has done cataclysmically over the cen­tury since
Nietzsche stopped writing. For this reason, Nietzsche does foresee
\"radical change in the lives of most people,\" albeit not so much
radical change within the life of the single in­dividual as radical
change, over the coming centuries, in the ways the majority of people
live. Such change, Nietzsche is con­vinced, is inevitable: he need not
cause it, and he cannot stop it. But he can and does attempt to
influence its direction. Nietzsche\'s question, more directly, is not
whether the Christian form of moral dogmatism can be preserved;
Nietzsche is convinced that it cannot be. The question is, what will
replace it? A new form of dogmatism? A European Buddhism, perhaps? The
idiocy of the last man? Or, perhaps, a world within which at least some
human beings will continue to strive both to be kind and thoughtful, and
to exhibit the perseverance in the quest for beauty Proust lauds in
Vermeer, but \"for other reasons than hitherto\" \-- not for the sake of
moral obligation? As long as the illusion of moral judgment holds sway,
Nietzsche\'s question cannot be my guiding question, for as long as that
illusion holds, Zarathustra\'s minotaur rules: good for all, evil for
all. [A post-moral world]{.underline}, one wherein the minotaur was
silenced, [would be one in which each of us could determine his or her
own good]{.underline}; that would have to be a world within which
diversity would be encouraged rather than inhibited. [But that, it might
seem, would entail a new form of moral dog­matism, one with the
paradoxical form, \"the good for all is that there be no \'good for
all\'\"? How could Nietzsche defend such a perspective, or such
affirmation, as one appropriate for everyone]{.underline}?

**It is impossible to separate Nietzsche's celebration of cruelty,
violence, and hierarchy from his other concepts---they are utterly
central to his philosophy.**

**Wolin, 06** (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with
Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, Professor of
History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City
University).

[Nietzsche was an apostle of cultural grandeur, but he was also a dogged
defender of power, cruelty and the warrior ethos as personified by
several of history\'s more sanguinary tyrants: Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar, and Napoleon. The problem for interpreters who seek to
aestheticize (and thereby, as it were, anesthetize) Nietzsche\'s
doctrines is that, as the following quote from the Nachlass shows, **in
his mind conquest and cultural flourishing went hand in hand**: \"The
new philosopher can arise only in conjunction with a ruling caste, as
its highest spiritualization. Great Politics, rule of the earth, are at
hand.\"]{.underline} Of course Nietzsche was anything but a systematic
thinker, and the result has been the predictable hermeneutic feeding
frenzy that has always surrounded his work. Nevertheless, [\"will to
power\" and \"great politics\" were mainstays of his later thought. Any
attempt to interpretively brush these concepts aside risks distorting
Nietzsche\'s central philosophical intentions.]{.underline}

**Nietzsche's writing was instrumental in Nazism. Their argument that
his "great politics" was only a metaphor ignores the fact that he did
help to inspire one of the worst phases in human history and that other
authors cannot be appropriated in that way.**

**Wolin, 06** (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with
Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, Professor of
History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City
University).

After all, [the National Socialists viewed the doctrine of \"total war\"
and the unprecedented genocide and carnage it had unleashed in
quintessentially Nietzschean terms: as a]{.underline} Gotzendiimmmng or
\"[twilight of the idols,\" a macabre aesthetic spectacle of the first
order. Documentary evidence corroborates the extent to which the
SS]{.underline} (Schutz Staffel[) adopted as its credo-and thereby found
ideological inspiration to carry out the \"Final Solution\"-Nietzsche\'s
admonitions to \"live dangerously\" and to practice \"self-overcoming.\"
As French fascist]{.underline} Marcel Deat [remarked at the height of
World War 11, \"Nietzsche\'s idea of the selection of \'good Europeans\'
is now being realized on the battlefield]{.underline}, by the LFV and
the Waffen SS. An aristocracy, a knighthood is being created by the war
which will be the hard, pure nucleus of the Europe of the future.\" [The
Nazis found Nietzsche\'s self-understanding as a \"good European\"
eminently serviceable for their bellicose, imperialist ends: as an
ideological justification for continental political
hegemony]{.underline}. The Third Reich\'s ideology planners considered
only three books fit for inclusion at the Tannenberg Memorial
commemorating Germany\'s World War I triumph over Russia: Mein Kampf
Alfred Rosenberg\'s Myth of the Twentieth Century, and Nietzsche\'s
Zarathtra. [Although the Nazis also tried to render German poets such as
Goethe and Schiller serviceable for their cause, their attachment to the
traditional ideals of European humanism represented a formidable hurdle.
In Nietzsche\'s case, however, no such obstacles existed.]{.underline}
As Steven Aschheim observes in The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany: Here was
a German thinker with what appeared to be genuinely thematic and tonal
links, who was able to provide the Nazis with a higher philosophical
pedigree and a rationale for central tenets of their weltanschauung. As
Franz Neumann noted in 1943, Nietzsche \"provided National Socialism
with an intellectual father who had greatness and wit, whose style was
beautiful and not abominable, who was able to articulate the resentment
against both monopoly capitalism and the rising proletariat.\" [Was it
really so far-fetched, as Nietzsche\'s defenders have claimed, that a
thinker who celebrated Machtpolitik, flaunted the annihilation of the
weak, toyed with the idea of a Master Race, and despised the Jews for
having introduced a cowardly \"slave morality\" into the heretofore
aristocratic discourse of European culture-was it really so far-fetched
that such a thinker would become the Nazis\' court
philosopher]{.underline}? Reflecting on Nietzsche\'s fascination with
breeding, extermination, and conquest-all in the name of a \"racial
hygiene\" designed to produce superior Beings-the historian Ernst Nolte
speculates that [the scope and extent of the wars envisioned by the
philosopher might well have surpassed anything Hitler and company were
capable of enacting]{.underline}: What Nietzsche had in mind was a
\"pure\" civil war. Yet when one thinks the idea through to its logical
conclusion, what needs to be annihilated \[vernichtet\] is the entire
tendency of human development since the end of classical antiquity . .
.: Christian priests, vulgar champions of the Enlightenment, democrats,
socialists, together with the shepherds and herds of the weak and
degenerate. [If \"annihilation]{.underline}\" \[Vernichtung\] [is
understood literally, then the result would be a mass murder in
comparison with which the Nazis\' \"Final Solution\" seems
microscopic.]{.underline}

(Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?

On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy,

[Nietzsche was clearly an elitist]{.underline} who believed in the right
to rule of a \"good and healthy aristocracy,\" one that would, if
necessary, be [**ready to sacrifice untold numbers of human beings**. He
sometimes wrote as if nations primarily existed for the sake of
producing a few \"great men,\" who could not be expected to show
consideration for \"normal humanity]{.underline}.\" Not suprisingly, in
the light of the cruel century that has just ended, one is bound to
regard such statements with grave misgivings. [From Mussolini and Hitler
to Stalin,]{.underline} Mao, Pol Pot, and Saddam Hussein, [the last
eighty years have been riddled with so-called political geniuses
imagining that they were \"beyond good and evil\"]{.underline} and free
of any moral constraints. [One has to ask if there is not something in
Nietzsche\'s philosophy with its uninhibited cultivation of a heroic
individualism and the will to power, which may have tended to favor the
fascist ethos. Musssolini]{.underline}, for example, [raised the
Nietzschean formulation \"live dangerously]{.underline}\" (*vivi
pericolosamente*) [to]{.underline} the status of [a fascist
slogan]{.underline}. His reading of Nietzsche was one factor in
converting him from Marxism to a philosophy of sacrifice and warlike
deeds in defense of the fatherland. In this mutation, Mussolini was
preceded by Gabriele d\'Annunzio, whose passage from aestheticism to the
political activism of a new, more virile and warlike age, was (as Mario
Sznajder points out in his essay) greatly influenced by Nietzsche.
Equally, there were other representatives of the First World War
generation, like the radical German nationalist writer, Ernst Jünger,
who would find in Nietzsche\'s writings a legitimization of the warrior
ethos (as David Ohana makes clear). There have also been Marxist critics
like George Lukács, who saw in Nietzsche\'s philosophy nothing more than
an ideological apologia for the rapacious plunder of German capitalist
imperialism and a particularly destructive form of irrationalism. Lukács
insisted both on the reactionary coherence of Nietzsche\'s \"system\"
and on the \"barren chaos\" of his arbitrary language, singling him out
as one of the most dangerous \"intellectual class-enemies\" of
socialism. Lukács\'s own miserable record as an apologist (for the
crimes of Stalinism), gave his one-sided reading of Nietzsche (which
equated hostility to egalitarian socialism with fascist imperialism)
transparently propagandist coloring, yet it is an interpretation that
had considerable influence in its day. Many commentators have raised the
question as to whether the vulgar exploitation of Nietzsche by fascists,
militarists, and Nazis could indeed be altogether arbitrary. [While
almost any philosophy can be]{.underline} propagandistically
[abused]{.underline} (as Hans Sluga has shown, Kant was a particular
favorite among academic philosophers of the Third Reich!),
[Nietzsche]{.underline}\'s pathos, his imaginative excesses as well as
his image as a prophetseer and creator of myths, [seems especially
conducive to such abuse by fascists]{.underline}. The radical manner in
which Nietzsche thrust himself against the boundaries of conventional
(Judeo-Christian) morality and dramatically proclaimed that God (meaning
the bourgeois Christian faith of the nineteenth century) was dead,
undoubtedly appealed to something in Nazism that wished to transgress
and transcend all existing taboos. The [totalitarianism]{.underline} of
the twentieth century (of both the Right and Left) [presupposed a
breakdown of all authority and moral norms, of which Nietzsche
was]{.underline} indeed [a]{.underline} clear-sighted
[prophet]{.underline}, precisely because he had diagnosed nihilism as
the central problem of his society\--that of fin de si\`ecle Europe.

**Even if every argument that they make about Nietzsche resisting
fascism is right, the fact remains that his anti-democratic rants fueled
one of the worst regimes in history.**

**Comte- Sponville 91** (Andre, Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne.
"The Brute, the Sophist, and the Aesthete "Art in the Service of
Illusion*"*, *Why We are Not Nietzscheans*).

We have to stop here for a moment to rule out some false trails and one
false conclusion. [We know that the Nazis often claimed to be inspired
by Nietzsche]{.underline} and that, for example, Hitler made a gift to
Mussolini of a luxury edition (that the former had had printed in 1935
of our author\'s Complete Works. [Such facts]{.underline}, and others
one could cite, [prove nothing. It is doubtful that Hitler ever read
Nietzsche]{.underline}, or read more anyway than scattered quotes. [And
that Nietzsche is in no way suspect of Nazism is a certainty to which
both chronology and the reading of the texts are enough to lead us. But
the disciples are a little hasty when they conclude that therefore there
is no problem]{.underline} and that anyone would definitely have to be
ill intentioned to see the least relation between Nietzsche and Hitler.
[Without]{.underline}, obviously, [being one of Nazism\'s
causes]{.underline}, or even one of its real sources, [Nietzsche belongs
nevertheless to the same spiritual world-antidemocratic, anti-Jewish,
antirationalist German thought that will also produce
Nazism]{.underline}, and that fact explains to some extent the
Nietzschean pretentions of this or that Nazi as well as the Nazi
strayings of this or that Nietzschean without in any way authorizing
them. \"[A doctrine]{.underline},\" Jankirlirvitch said about Nazism,
\"[in which Heidegger immediately found himself and which so visibly
carries Nietzsche\'s mark.]{.underline}\" In both cases, that\'s going
too far. Maybe. [But it would not be going far enough-in both cases-to
attribute to chance or to misunderstanding]{.underline} the monstrous
proximity that made of Heidegger a Nazi and seemed, though erroneously,
to give the Nazis Nietzsche\'s blessing. \"The porks will wallow in my
doctrine\" the latter had foreseen, and that, indeed, is what happened.
But why? [We can hardly imagine the Nazis laying claim to Kant or
Husserl in the same way]{.underline}, and every doctrine, we may say,
has the porks it deserves. \"[There will be wars the like of which have
never yet been seen on earth,\" Nietzsche also announced, bragging about
it. \"It is only beginning with me that the earth knows great
politics.]{.underline} It is of course clear that there is a great deal
of derision in these swaggering. But a philosopher turns prophet at his
own risk. Whose fault is it if, now that history has gone on further
down the road, we have the choice only between the ridiculous and the
odious?

# AFF: anti-semetic

**Nietzsche rejection of values in favor of accepting disorder has
fueled Nazism. Our argument is not that his writing was explicitly
anti-Semetic, but the history of misappropriation proves that the
alternative is politically undesirable.**

**Golomb and Wistrich 02** (Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism? (Professors
at the Hebrew University),

On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy,
<http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i7403.html>).

[At first sight, this sharp rejection of anti-Semitism might seem a good
enough reason to answer negatively]{.underline} and decisively [the
question concerning Nietzsche\'s responsibility for Nazism]{.underline}.
Certainly, a thinker who held a high opinion of Jewish qualities, looked
to them as a spearhead for his own free-thinking Dionysian \"revaluation
of all values,\" and sought their full integration into European society
could hardly be blamed for the Nazi Holocaust. [On the other hand, in
his sweeping rejection of Judeo-Christian values]{.underline} (as they
were mirrored in German Protestantism) [Nietzsche constantly referred to
their origin in the sublime \"vengefulness\" of Israel and its alleged
exploitation of so-called movements of \"decadence]{.underline}\" (like
early Christianity, liberalism, and socialism) [to ensure its own
self-preservation and survival]{.underline} (Menahem Brinker). Even
though Nietzsche\'s prime target was clearly Christianity\--which he
also blamed for the suffering of the Jews\--the source of the infection
ultimately lay in that fateful transvaluation of values initiated by
priestly Judaism two millennia ago. [It was a selective reading of this
Nietzschean indictment of Judeo-Christianity that led]{.underline} the
late Jacob [Talmon]{.underline}, an Israeli historian, some forty years
ago [to see in Nietzsche a major intellectual signpost on the road to
Auschwitz]{.underline}. Moreover, [even when describing the
\"Judaization\" of the world in terms that mixed admiration with
disapprobation, Nietzsche seemed inadvertently to be feeding the myth of
Jewish power,]{.underline} so beloved of Christian and racist
anti-Semites. Though his intentions were profoundly hostile to
anti-Semitism, this provocative technique was undoubtedly a dangerous
game to play. While it would be senseless to hold Nietzsche responsible
for such distortions, one can find troubling echoes of a vulgarized and
debased Nietzscheanism in the later diatribes of Hitler, Himmler,
Bormann, and Rosenberg against Judeo-Christianity.

# AFF: at: affirming difference alternative

**Their theory should be rejected because of dismal empirical
results---the politics of difference have justified racial separatism
while modernism has mobilized egalitarian social movements.**

**Wolin, 06** (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with
Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, Professor of
History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City
University).

P[aradoxically, whereas a visceral rejection of political
modernity]{.underline} (rights of man, rule of law, constitutionalism)
[was once standard fare among counterrevolutionary thinkers, it has now
become fashionable among advocates of the cultural left. Postmodernists
equate democracy with \"soft totalitarianism]{.underline}.\" They argue
that by privileging public reason and the common good, liberal democracy
effectively suppresses otherness and difference. Of course, one could
very easily make the converse argument: [historically speaking,
democracy and rule of law have proved the best guarantors of cultural
diversity and political pluralism. During the 1980s the debate on
\"difference\" would take an insidious turn as the European New
Right]{.underline}, led by France\'s Jean-Marie Le Pen, [embraced the
\"right to difference\" as a justification for racial
separatism]{.underline}. The shock of recognition resulting from Le
Pen\'s electoral successes pushed the European left firmly back into the
democratic republican camp. Although Derrida has recently professed a
sly interest in a nebulous \"democracy to come\" (\"democratic a
venir/avenir\"), what he might have in mind by this metapolitical
decree-long on rhetoric and short on empirical substance-is anybody\'s
guess. [By denying the basic emancipatory potentials of democracy, by
downplaying the significant differences between it and its totalitarian
anathesis, the postmodern left has openly consigned itself to the
political margins. For, whatever their empirical failings, states
predicated on rule of law contain a basic capacity for internal
political change fundamentally absent from illiberal political regimes.
Over the last forty years, the qualified successes of the women\'s,
antiwar, ecological, civil, and gay rights movements have testified to
this political rule of thumb]{.underline}.

**Affirmation of differences utterly incompatible with the compromises
needed for democracy---authoritarianism is the only government that can
control a populace that no longer believes in pluralism.**

**Taguieff, 91** (Pierre-André, director of research at
[CNRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNRS) (in an [Institut d\'Etudes
Politiques de
Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Institute_of_Political_Studies)
The "Traditionalist Paradigm- Horror of Modernity and Antiliberalism*"
Why We are Not Nietzscheans)*.

One cannot be a Nietzschean the way one can be a Kantian, a Hegelian, or
a Marxist. Positions and analyses count less than the manner, or the
style, which is led by the power to destroy and the capacity to assert
with absoluteness. The destructive aim is directed first of all against
pluralist/liberal democracy, the object of supreme detestation. Then it
is turned against the socialist utopias that intend to fully realize the
virtual possibilities of modern egalitarian democracy. [After the
devastating demystification that is effected by Nietzsche\'s philosophy,
from the moment we attempt to follow it in its ultimate consequences on
the political terrain, no expectations become possible that could be
fulfilled within the limits of modern democracy. Nothing remains but the
exalted call for the \"coup de force\" and the dream of a redemptive
dictatorship. Various generations of Nietzscheanizing aesthetes and
pious interpreters have made an effort not to see this terrible logical
conclusion, to hide or mask it. It is time to recognize that
Nietzsche\'s pluralism, his hyperrelativistic perspectivism, is, far
from being consonant with the regulated pluralism implied by liberal
democracy, its total negation]{.underline}. Radical relativism is for
Nietzsche but a destructive weapon intended to completely disqualify the
value systems and the beliefs of the modern world. Nietzsche does not
call for us to settle down comfortably into skeptical doubt, cultural
relativism, or doxic pluralism. [The \"hardness\" that his thinking
requires]{.underline}, at least in its prophetic mood, [is of the kind
implied by the assertion of irreducible differences or of hierarchical
distances that are also destinies]{.underline}. Do we need to insist on
the incompatibility of such an absoluteness of hierarchical difference
with the foundational egalitarian requirements of the modern democratic
sphere? To be convinced of this, we need to read in their entirety,
without evading the letter of the text through this or that angelic
reconstruction, fragments as explicit as the following one, of which
there are plenty: One of the tendencies of evolution is, necessarily,
that which levels humanity . . . The other tendency, my tendency, on the
contrary tends to accentuate differences, widen distances, suppress
equality, and create monsters of power. [The absolute affirmation of
difference, the total negation of equality, the cult of hierarchies
based on nature: these are the paths that lead to the heroic road, which
lead us to the straight road thought out by the \"immoralist.\" It is
the only road pointed to by the radical, sovereign negations-the \"no of
the yes\"-uttered against the modern world]{.underline} by the
philosopher of the Will to Power. They hardly need to be added to.

# AFF: nietzsche racist

**Nietzsche is explicitly racist---he praises Aryans and calls others
degenerates. They will say that it is only a metaphor but that flies in
the face of his repeated emphasis on biological determinism.**

**Comte- Sponville 91** (Andre, Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne.
"The Brute, the Sophist, and the Aesthete "Art in the Service of
Illusion*"*, *Why We are Not Nietzscheans*).

[Nietzsche\'s thinking is racist in its essence through its
conjunction]{.underline} (under cover of heredity) [of elitism with
biologism]{.underline}. \"One pays a price for being the child of one\'s
parents,\" Nietzsche wrote in The Gay Science (348), but he is more
precise in Beyond Good and *Evil* (§ 264): \"It is simply not possible
that a human being should not have the qualities and preferences of his
parents and ancestors in his body, whatever appearances may suggest to
the contrary. This is the problem of race. If one knows something about
the parents, an inference about the child is permissible.\" [For
Nietzsche, because of that every human activity depends on what he calls
\"blood\"]{.underline} (Geblut), [and even philosophy doesn\'t escape
from this: For every high world one must be born; or to speak more
clearly, one must be cultivated for it: a right to philosophy-taking
that word in its great sense-one has only by virtue of one\'s origins;
one\'s ancestors, one\'s \"blood\" decide here, too.]{.underline} Many
generations must have labored to prepare the origin of the philosopher;
every one of his virtues must have been acquired, nurtured, inherited,
and digested singly. (BGE, 21 3) The same illumination is, as we might
have supposed, also valid for the general history of humanity. In The
Genealogy of Morals (I, 4, j), after having noted that the \"veritable
method to follow\" was the genealogical one, Nietzsche writes: In the
Latinmalus (which I place next to Greek melas) could indicate the common
man as the dark one, especially as the black-haired one (\"hic niger est
-\"), as the pre-Aryan dweller of the Italian soil which distinguished
itself most clearly through his color from blonds who became their
masters, namely the Aryan conquering race. And then he adds this remark
(whose status in a philosophy book leads one to wonder): \"The Celts, by
the way, were definitely a blond race.\" [And he gravely asks himself:
Who can say whether modern democracy, even more modern anarchism and
especially that inclination for \"commune,\" for the most primitive form
of society, which is now shared by all the socialists of Europe, does
not signify in the main a tremendous counterattack-and that the
conqueror and master race, the Aryan, is not succumbing physiologically,
too]{.underline}? (GM, I, 5) [And he drives the nail in the wall:
\"These carriers of the most humiliating and vengeance-seeking
instincts, the descendants of all European and non-European slavery,
especially of the pre-Aryan people-they represent mankind\'s
regression]{.underline}! These \'instruments of culture\' are a shame
for human beings, and a cause for suspicion, a counterargument against
\'culture\' in general!\" (GM, I, 11). [And he praises, on the contrary,
\"the blond beast]{.underline} at the bottom of all the predominant
races,\" all the \"jubilant monsters, who perhaps came out of a terrible
sequence of murders, burnings, rapes, tortures with high spirits and
tranquility of soul, as if it had all been a case of student high jinks;
convinced that the poets would now have something to sing and to praise
for a long time\" (ibid.)! And, perhaps influenced by Gobineau, whom he
greatly admired. At heart in these predominant races we cannot mistake
the beast of prey, the blond beast who lusts after booty and victory . .
. The deep, icy mistrust the German brings forth when he comes to power,
even today, is an echo of the indelible outrage with which Europe looked
on the rage of the blond Germanic beast for hundreds of years31 All of
these texts, and many others one could quote, justify my title, or at
least its first qualifier. Not of course that Nietzsche was a brute as
an individual (the poor man didn\'t have the means!); but he is the
philosopher-and the only one to my knowledge (for though Machiavelli
legitimizes immorality politically, he doesn\'t thereby condemn morality
as such)-who justifies brutes and consciously makes models out of them.
[At this point it will be said-the Nietzscheans will say that these
texts should not be taken literall]{.underline}y, that they have but a
metaphorical meaning, that the \"force\" they extol is of an
intellectual kind, and finally that (as Heidegger is supposed to have
demonstrated!) there is in Nietzsche no biologism, and that therefore
the \"races\" he evokes are not really races. Unfortunately, if metaphor
there is, it works the other way. Nietzsche often explained himself
about this, and it touches the heart of his doctrine: far from the body
being the metaphor of the spirit, it is on the contrary the spirit that
is the metaphor of the body, its sign or symptom,42 and all philosophy
is in that sense \"an interpretation of the body and a *misunderstanding
of the body*\" (*GS*, preface). Nietzsche adds: Behind the highest value
judgements that have hitherto guided the history of thought, there are
concealed misunderstandings of the physical constitution - of
individuals or classes or even whole races. All those bold insanities of
metaphysics, especially answers to the question about the *value* of
existence, may always be considered first of all as the symptoms of
certain bodies. [To want to absolve Nietzsche of his barbaric or racist
remarks on the pretext that, in his case]{.underline} (and contrary, it
is specified, to what we see in Mein Kampf or among the theoreticians of
national socialism), [it is metaphysics is to be mistaken from beginning
to end about the status of Nietzschean metaphysics, which, far from
escaping from the body\'s vital order (and therefore from biologism), is
but one of its expressions]{.underline} (a \"symptom[\"), neither the
most dignified nor the most important one, and one, most of all, that
remains de facto and de jure dependent on the body]{.underline}. This is
put clearly in one of the posthumously published notes: All our
religions and philosophies are the symptoms of our bodily state: that
Christianity achieved victory was the result of a generalized feeling of
listlessness and of a mixture of races (that is, of conflict and
disarray in the organism). ***(Kroner,*** XIII, § 600) Thus we must take
\"the body and physiology \[as\] the starting point\" (WP, \$492);
consider \"all that is \'conscious\' . . . only of secondary
importance\" (Kroner, XIII, \$ 382), and consequently revise \"our
beliefs and our very principle of evaluation\" and only hold on to the
intellect (das Geistige) as \"the body\'s sign language\" (ibid.; see
also WP, \$ 707, 676). This is where Nietzsche is closest to
materialism-and where the materialist must therefore be the most
vigilant. If \"in man there is material\" (BGE, 225), [if the soul is
only the symptom of the body and if this symptomatology is itself, as
Nietzsche never ceases to repeat, biologically determined, how can we
not proceed from physical differences (those that result from heredity)
to intellectual differences-and what is that called if not
racism?]{.underline} The most radical materialisms escape, or can
escape, from this by subordinating life to something other than itself,
from a point of view either theoretical (the true is not a symptom) or
physical (matter is neither racist nor racial), or practical (it is not
morality which must subordinate itself to life; it is life, in human
beings, which must subordinate itself to morality: even if the notion of
race were biologically pertinent, racism would still be morally
damnable). Racism is, in a word, a hermeneutics of the epidermis (that
is its theoretical error) that mistakes heredity for a morality (that is
its practical flaw). It is a barbarous and superficial materialism. I
can\'t draw out the analysis of all this to the extent the topic
demands. But it will already be understood at this point that, rejecting
as he does both idealism (which is a nonsense for the body) and, in the
end, materialism itself (because, he makes clear, \"I do not believe in
\'matter\'\"), 44 Nietzsche can only fall into vitalism (in a large
sense: he doesn\'t believe in the existence of any kind of vital
principle either) or, if you prefer, into biologism. That is his
ontology, what separates him from materialism: \"Being-we have no idea
of it apart from the idea of \'living.\'-How can anything dead
\'be\'?\"45 But \"the organic was not generated\" (Kroner, XIII, \$
560). Organic life is essentially will to power, as Nietzsche hammers on
repeatedly, and will to power is, as we know, the basis of reality.

# AFF: at: nietzsche's k of reason

**Nietzschean critiques of reason are deeply
disempowering---universalism has empirically been successful in the
fight against social injustice.**

**Wolin, 06** (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with
Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, Professor of
History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City
University).

[Nietzsche]{.underline} certainly [was a radical critic of reason. He
wished to show that the modern West, by emphatically opting for the
values of instrumental rationalism, had systematically precluded other,
more distinguished value options]{.underline}. Nietzsche forcefully
sought to demonstrate the opportunity costs of-the one-sidedness and
partiality of, as well as the losses entailed by-\"cultural
rationalization\" (Max Weber). He once lamented that the modern West
suffered from a \'hypertrophy of the intellect,\" to the detriment of
other venerable and worthy human faculties-and on this point who would
disagree? Yet in the rush to radicalize Nietzsche, to enlist his
services in a series of bitter, internecine intellectual disputes, the
Gallic reception willfully suppressed the subtleties and nuances of his
position. In French hands Nietzsche was transformed from a principled
critic of reason into a devout foe of the same. [Beginning with Socrates
and culminating with the Enlightenment, the critical employment of
reason highlighted the tension between the claims of reason and the
unreasonable character of existing social institutions. As such,
reason\'s claims were always inimical to illegitimate social authority.
Reason sought to illuminate the cleft between unjustifiable claims to
authority and its own more general, \"universal\" standpoint. If, as
later historians contended, the collapse of the ancien regime was a
foregone conclusion, its demise had been precipitated by]{.underline}
the labor of criticism undertaken by lumieres and philosophes, [the
so-called party of reason.]{.underline}

**Rejection of all reason is mental suicide and risks repeating the
worst politics of the 20^th^ century.**

**Wolin 98** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History @ City U. of
New York Graduate Center, "The anti-American revolution," The New
Republic, Washington, Aug 17-Aug 24, 1998, Vol. 219, Iss. 7/8; pg.
35-42)

[In the postmodernist demonology, it is the Enlightenment that bears
direct historical responsibility for the Gulag and Auschwitz. In the
eyes of these convinced misologists, or enemies of reason, modern
totalitarianism is merely the upshot of the universalizing impetus of
Enlightenment reason]{.underline}. Or, as Foucault once observed,
\"reason is torture.\" According to the \"politics of difference,\"
moreover, [reason is little more than the ideological window-dressing
for Eurocentrism and its horrors. These wild claims are historically
inaccurate. They are also self-defeating: if we abandon rational
argument, we have little left to rely on but the \"right of the
strongest\" or \"identity politics.\" (National Socialism was a
monumentally monstrous instance of \"identity politics.\") And they are
also self contradictory. For the enemies of reason can only advance
their position through force of the better argument; that is, by giving
reasons that aim to convince others. To criticize reason\'s failings is
one thing. To reject it in its entirety is not antirationalism but
antiintellectualism, or mental suicide.]{.underline}

[A]{.underline} second, no less [serious error consists in suspecting

[That truth is, properly speaking, inhuman, meaning that it in no wise
depends on human desire or will-any more than the existence of oil under
the soil of Saudi Arabia depends on the desires it brings about-does not
in and of itself have any dogmatic effects, quite the contrary. It is
this inhumanity which permits the assertion that anyone, me, you, all of
us perhaps are wrong]{.underline}, because we have not arrived at a
truth that does not depend on our means for getting to it. Truth is not
an epistemological concept.
