Senior Saudi officials have discussed a plan to stop invoicing oil in
dollars and switch to other currencies if the No Oil Producing and
Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC), recently introduced in Congress, becomes
law.

The threat has been **[communicated to top officials in Washington and
leaked to signal the strength of the kingdom's opposition]{.underline}**
("Saudi Arabia threatens to ditch dollar oil trades to stop NOPEC",
Reuters, April 5).

**[Invoicing oil sales in euros or yuan would aim to damage the U.S.
dollar's status as the petro-recycling currency]{.underline}** and its
reserve status more generally, weakening its value and taking aim at
U.S. financial dominance.

In practice, the threat is not credible since **[the kingdom relies
almost totally on the United States for its security, including
purchases of armaments and training, intelligence sharing, and support
in its conflict in Yemen.]{.underline}**

**[The kingdom could not afford to jeopardise its security relationship
and close ties with the present U.S. administration.]{.underline}**

But it does illustrate the **[strain on relations that has emerged
between the kingdom and the United States]{.underline}**, especially the
White House, over the desirable level of oil prices.

Those tensions are likely to intensify as the United States gears up for
congressional and presidential elections in November 2020.

PRICE DISAGREEMENT

On most issues, **[Saudi Arabia's rulers and the White House are more
closely aligned than ever before]{.underline}** -- especially in their
shared commitment to confronting Iran.

**[Saudi Arabia is central to the regional security system the Trump
administration has been trying to assemble]{.underline}** to contain
Iran's influence in the Middle East.

In turn, **[Saudi Arabia has become increasingly dependent on the United
States for its internal and external security as its conflict with Iran
escalates, both in the diplomatic arena and in wars being fought by
proxy in the region.]{.underline}**

The U.S and Saudi governments need each other. On the issue of oil
prices, however, the two disagree sharply.

President Donald **[Trump has made clear he wants oil prices to remain
below \$70]{.underline}** per barrel in a series of messages posted on
Twitter and delivered in television interviews.

**[Saudi Arabia, by contrast, needs prices well over \$70 and probably
over \$80]{.underline}** to shore up its government finances, pay for an
expensive economic transformation and stem the deterioration in its own
balance of payments.

#### Dollar heg is the internal link to literally every form of US power

**[The persistence of dollar hegemony is due to America's overwhelming
monetary capability and its ability to mobilize capabilities through
different forms of power.]{.underline}** Drawing on David Baldwin's
(1980) important insight about the 'relative-infungibility' of power
resources, I show how the United States uses its multi-dimensional
resource base to influence others in specific contexts. In analyzing the
dollar's perseverance in light of different expressions of power, I use
Dahl's (1957), Bachrach and Baratz's (1962) and Lukes' (1974)
definitions of the first, second and third faces of power. **[Hard power
through coercive means, some form of payment (monetary or quid pro quo)
or soft power (the power of example or attraction) is applied when
exercising these various forms of power]{.underline}** (Nye, 2011).
Nye's concept of soft power (1990, 2002) is challenged by Barnett and
Duvall on the grounds that 'the capacities of actors to determine the
conditions of their existence' (2005: 42) is not at stake when actors
voluntarily change preferences and behavior through persuasion. Barnett
and Duvall's (2005) justification for excluding persuasion as a form of
power is unconvincing and leaves out a wide range of instances in which
power is exercised. One of their reasons for excluding persuasion is
that 'most scholars interested in power are concerned not simply with
how effects are produced, but rather with how these effects work to the
advantage of some and the disadvantage of others' (Barnett and Duvall,
2005: 42). As Baldwin (2013) notes, unintended effects need not be
negative, so Barnett and Duvall's (2005) unwillingness to recognize
persuasion as a form of power on the grounds that a persuaded party is
not disadvantaged is questionable. Moreover, Barnett and Duvall's (2005:
42--3, 53, 63) complaint that persuasion involves a voluntary change in
preference conflicts with their definition of structural and productive
power since they see these two forms of power as including a consensual
element. They say the United States 'has worked hard to generate consent
--- that is, to get those who are structurally disadvantaged because of
their position in the world political economy to accept the order of
things' (Barnett and Duvall, 2005: 65). In this case, some form of
persuasion is implied. The first face of power Bargaining power, or
relational power is the ability to change the affected party's perceived
costs and benefits of the available options through force, payment or
persuasion. These 'influence attempts \[are\] based on positive
sanctions \... and negative sanctions' (Baldwin, 1978: 1231). Medium of
exchange The United States can only encourage private actors to use the
dollar as a medium of exchange by applying the first face of power to
other currency functions. For example, promoting the use of dollars as a
unit of account implicitly raises the use of dollars as medium of
exchange since the invoicing currency is usually the settlement
currency. There is no obvious direct way the United States can promote
the official use of dollars as a medium of exchange through the first
face of power either. The United States has nothing to win with central
banks using a currency other than the one that will have greatest market
impact. Instead, maximum effect is achieved by using the currency that
is most frequently and widely traded in foreign-exchange markets for
vehicle purposes. Unit of account By threatening, rewarding or
persuading countries to choose a strategy other than their preferred
one, the American government can preserve or raise private use of
dollars as a unit of account. For example, as the single most coveted
export destination in the world, the United States can threaten market
closure, or promise increased openness, to incite others to open their
markets or allow American firms to invest or open subsidiaries abroad.
Growth in American exports or production of US multinational
corporations (MNCs) will intensify the use of dollars for invoicing
purposes, that is a as unit of account for private actors. Most American
exports, as well as goods produced by US foreign subsidiaries, are
differentiated. Early theories suggested that the lower price
sensitivity of such goods gave exporters incentives to reduce demand
uncertainty (and thus sales fluctuations) by invoicing in the home
currency (McKinnon, 1979). More recent research also suggests invoicing
will occur in the exporter's home currency, but for different reasons.
Citing Magee and Rao's (1980) finding, Wyplosz (1997: 7-8) argues that
invoicing a lower price in the exporter's home currency or a higher
price in foreign currency amounts to the same thing and concludes that
explanations based on minimizing transaction costs (Niehans, 1969,
Krugman, 1980, Chrystal, 1984) are more convincing than ones based on
invoicing in the exporter's currency. An expansion of American buying
power in homogenous goods will also tend to increase the dollar's unit
of account function. In this case, exporters have incentives to price in
local currency (i.e., dollars) to avoid a drop in sales when the local
currency depreciates vis-a-vis the home currency (McKinnon, 1979).
Given, greater differentiation in American exports and MNC production
than in American imports, we should expect that the net effect of
American commercial expansion and import penetration is to raise the
unit of account function for dollars. The invoicing, and settlement, of
certain commodities such as oil in dollars --- the so-called
'petro-dollar' market --- is the immediate result of bargaining and, as
such, a palpable instance of the directed, intentional influence
attempts envisaged by David Baldwin (1980). After the collapse of the
Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1971, the United States
insisted that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states price oil in dollars
and not accept any other currency in exchange (Spiro, 1999). The bargain
was not purely coercive; there was a quid pro quo in the form of assured
US military presence. This exchange of dollar support for security
benefits is reminiscent of the offset agreement under the Bretton Woods
fixed exchange rate regime whereby Germany agreed to prop up the dollar
price of gold in order to secure US troops in Germany (Zimmermann,
2002). The United States could put pressure on other governments to
adopt the dollar as the official unit of account by providing incentives
to track the dollar. One way to achieve this would be to encourage
'dollarization'--- the wholesale adoption of the dollar as medium of
exchange, unit of account and store of value --- within a local economy
so that the dollar would effectively become the official unit of
account.2 In other cases, the United States has applied pressure to
convince governments to adopt an alternative unit of account --- for
example loosening the renminbi's quasi fixed exchange rate regime
against the dollar by branding China a 'currency manipulator' and
threatening trade retaliation. Store of value The American government
has very little bargaining power over which currency is used by private
investors to store value. Although the American government has the
authority to freeze dollar accounts when the United States has
jurisdiction over them such actions actually curtail rather than promote
dollar use. Besides the immediate effect of reducing dollar use,
arbitrarily freezing private dollar accounts has the long-term effect of
discouraging dollar savings in the United States. By contrast, with the
increased complexity of financial instruments and the intensification of
cross-border capital flows it is difficult to see how the American
government could deny investors residing in the United States (much less
foreign investors) the ability to save in non-dollar assets. Contrary to
tax evasion probes, where the United State is increasingly vigilant it
is much more complicated to interfere with private decisions about which
currency to use for investment purposes. Although there may have been
occasions where US officials have cajoled financial institutions or
corporations into holding dollar assets, such influence attempts are the
exception rather than the rule and cannot explain why dollars are held
privately worldwide. However, the United States can exercise this kind
of power over official actors. For example, when encouraging Gulf states
to invest oil proceeds in dollar-denominated assets while dissuading
them from diversifying into other currency denominations (Spiro, 1999).
As with private assets, the United States can freeze official dollar
accounts in the United States as it has done on a number of occasions.
Mostly recently Nigerian accounts in the United States were suspended.
However, such actions prompt diversification into competing currencies,
thus limiting rather than expanding dollar use. The United States has
also strong-armed countries to support the dollar's role as a store of
value through large-scale dollar purchases.

According to the 2018 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, in 2017
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** produced 12 million barrels of oil per
day. That **[accounted for 12.9% of the world\'s oil production, which
is in the range of the world\'s two other major oil production
superpowers \-- Russia and the U.S.]{.underline}**

However, **[there is an important distinction when it comes to Saudi
Arabia. In Russia, oil production is concentrated among a dozen or so
companies. In the U.S., thousands of companies acting in their own
self-interest produce oil]{.underline}**. But **[in Saudi Arabia, all of
the oil production is controlled by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil
company and reportedly the most profitable company in the
world.]{.underline}**

**[Given]{.underline}** that **[Saudi Arabia\'s share of oil production
is]{.underline}** well beyond the spare production capacity of the
world\'s most important commodity, Saudi Arabia has incredible economic
power. **[All Saudi Arabia would have to do is withhold three or four
million barrels of oil per day from the market, and prices would quickly
rise above \$100/barrel.]{.underline}**

Some analysts have floated the idea **[of oil prices getting as high as
\$200 or even \$400/bbl in the event of a disruption in Saudi\'s
petroleum output.]{.underline}** That may seem preposterous, but keep
**[in]{.underline}** mind that during the **[1973 oil embargo, oil
prices quadrupled in about six months]{.underline}**. **[Prices like
that would quickly push the global economy into
recessio]{.underline}**n, as it helped do in 1973. That is the power
Saudi Arabia holds.

**[Consider the oil price movements since 2014.]{.underline}** **[Oil
prices plunged because Saudi Arabia sought to win market share back from
the shale oil producers. So, OPEC flooded the market with oil, which
sent prices down by over 70%.]{.underline}**

Then, when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, **[Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports.]{.underline}**

**[No other entity in the world has as much power to move the oil
markets. Saudi Arabia could quickly bring the global economy to its
knees.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, as the world debates a harsh punishment for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
earlier this month, **[they really hold the trump card. \$100 billion in
potential arms sales is small potatoes considering the havoc Saudi
Arabia could unleash if it decided to use oil as an economic
weapon.]{.underline}**

This is just one price we pay for our dependence on oil**[. Global
economic security will continue to depend strongly on the cooperation of

powerhouse]{.underline}**. It vies with China and the U.S. for control
of Caspian and Central Asian energy and mineral wealth through alliances
with former Soviet states. It tends to strike tentative deals with China
to counter American interests, but ultimately Beijing may be as much of
a rival as Washington. **[Moscow uses its gas exports as a bargaining

The leaders of the G20 countries meet on Friday and Saturday in Osaka,

A trade war between the world's two biggest economies has weighed on

#### Saudi Arabia would retaliate by spiking oil prices to [\$100]{.underline} or more

accessed 6-26-2019, //CM\]

According to the 2018 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, in 2017
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** produced 12 million barrels of oil per
day. That **[accounted for 12.9% of the world\'s oil production, which
is in the range of the world\'s two other major oil production
superpowers \-- Russia and the U.S.]{.underline}**

However, **[there is an important distinction when it comes to Saudi
Arabia. In Russia, oil production is concentrated among a dozen or so
companies. In the U.S., thousands of companies acting in their own
self-interest produce oil]{.underline}**. But **[in Saudi Arabia, all of
the oil production is controlled by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil
company and reportedly the most profitable company in the
world.]{.underline}**

**[Given]{.underline}** that **[Saudi Arabia\'s share of oil production
is]{.underline}** well beyond the spare production capacity of the
world\'s most important commodity, Saudi Arabia has incredible economic
power. **[All Saudi Arabia would have to do is withhold three or four
million barrels of oil per day from the market, and prices would quickly
rise above \$100/barrel.]{.underline}**

Some analysts have floated the idea **[of oil prices getting as high as
\$200 or even \$400/bbl in the event of a disruption in Saudi\'s
petroleum output.]{.underline}** That may seem preposterous, but keep
**[in]{.underline}** mind that during the **[1973 oil embargo, oil
prices quadrupled in about six months]{.underline}**. **[Prices like
that would quickly push the global economy into
recessio]{.underline}**n, as it helped do in 1973. That is the power
Saudi Arabia holds.

**[Consider the oil price movements since 2014.]{.underline}** **[Oil
prices plunged because Saudi Arabia sought to win market share back from
the shale oil producers. So, OPEC flooded the market with oil, which
sent prices down by over 70%.]{.underline}**

Then, when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, **[Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports.]{.underline}**

**[No other entity in the world has as much power to move the oil
markets. Saudi Arabia could quickly bring the global economy to its
knees.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, as the world debates a harsh punishment for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi

Barrel Would Mean for the World Economy,\" Bloomberg,

**[Surging crude prices mean another headwind for the world
economy]{.underline}** after President Donald Trump\'s \'zero\' pledge
on Iran oil sales but oil dependent nations like Nigeria will benefit
hugely if oil were to attain those heights once again according to
analysts.

Brent, the international benchmark crude has risen about 33 percent this
year and is close to the highest in six months. **[While higher prices
due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy, a shock
from constrained supply is a negative.]{.underline}**

Much of what happens to Nigeria and the rest of the global economy will
depend on how sustained the price spike proves to be. Exporting nations
will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues, while consuming
nations will bear the cost at the pump, potentially fanning inflation
and hurting demand. Ultimately, there comes a point where higher prices
may be damaging to everyone.

Who wins from higher oil prices?

Emerging economies dominate the list of oil-producing nations which is
why they\'re affected more than developed ones. The increase in revenues
will help to repair budgets and current account deficits, allowing
governments to increase spending that will spur investment. Winners
include Saudi Arabia, Russia, Norway, Nigeria and Ecuador according to
analysis by Nomura.

What does it mean for global growth?

The impact will vary. Rising oil prices will hurt household income and
spending and it could accelerate inflation. As the world\'s biggest
importer of oil, China is vulnerable, and many countries in Europe also
rely on imported energy. Seasonal effects will also impact. With the
Northern Hemisphere summer approaching, consumers can switch energy
sources and scale back usage. A slowing world economy will also hurt
demand and by extension keep a lid on prices.

How can the world economy absorb oil at \$100?

**[For a sustained hit to growth, economists say oil would need to hold
above \$100]{.underline}**. It also depends on dollar strength or
weakness, given **[crude is priced in greenbacks.]{.underline}**
Analysis by Oxford Economics found that Brent at **[\$100 per barrel by
the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would
be 0.6 percent lower than currently projected by end-2020, with
inflation on average 0.7 percentage points higher.]{.underline}**

**[\'We see increased risks of significantly higher oil
prices,]{.underline}**\' Oxford economists John Payne and Gabriel Sterne
wrote in a note. **[\'In the short-run, it is likely the supply impact
will be offset by higher production elsewhere, but the market is
tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil
could reach \$100.\']{.underline}**

How will Iran and Trump impact the market?

An upending of global oil trade around the Iran-Trump spat could
continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets, as the affected
supply is as much as 800,000 barrels a day. Uncertainties around
availability have already whipsawed oil markets. And the political
sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for
volatility.

Trump has pledged to help, alongside Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., those
needing to shift orders from Iran to another supplier. But U.S. claims
that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to
meet, given that the daily American output for similar crude is about a
quarter of Iran\'s.

Who loses?

Those emerging economies nursing current account and **[fiscal deficits
run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies, which in
turn would spark inflation.]{.underline}** That in turn will **[force
governments and central banks to weigh up their options: hike interest
rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital
flight]{.underline}**. Nomura\'s losers list includes Turkey, Ukraine
and India.

What does it mean for the world\'s biggest economy?

While U.S. oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from
customers moving away from Iran, the broader U.S. economy won\'t
necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as **[\$100 a
barrel.]{.underline}**

It **[would be a squeeze on American consumers that are the backbone of
still-steady economic growth]{.underline}**. **[Prices at the gas pump
already have risen more than 7 percent this month to \$2.89 a gallon,
which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in March by the most since
2017.]{.underline}**

And if things go awry in global oil markets, there\'s risk that
political blame shifts back to the U.S. for the sanctions, which could
mean **[backlash via investment or other channels that threatens
economic stability.]{.underline}**

Will it lead to higher inflation around the world?

Because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges, policy
makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components. If the
run-up in prices proves to be substantial, and sustained, those costs
will filter through to transportation and utilities.

What does it mean for central banks?

**[Led by the Federal Reserve, central banks around the world have taken
a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift
their focus to slowing growth.]{.underline}** That\'s unlikely to
quickly change. The International Monetary Fund this month lowered its
global growth forecast and said the world is in a \'delicate moment.\'

**[After announcing the flotation of Saudi Aramco in 2016, the kingdom
began pushing for higher crude prices partly to help maximize the
valuation of the state oil company ahead of an initial public offering
(IPO), originally scheduled for 2018.]{.underline}**

That changed in April when U.S. President Donald Trump put public
pressure on Riyadh to keep crude prices in check, wanting to stop U.S.
fuel costs rising ahead of the U.S. midterm elections in November.

Now, even though the IPO has been shelved**[, Saudi Arabia still wants
to keep oil prices as high as possible without offending Washington, the
sources said. Saudi needs cash to finance a series of economic
development projects.]{.underline}**

**[OPEC and Saudi Arabia do not have an official price target and are

one of the sources told Reuters.

**["They need cash. They have plans and reforms and now the IPO is

**[An informal target of \$70 to \$80 raises the prospect of Saudi
Arabia making regular tweaks to its output to influence the cost of
crude as the market responds to other factors affecting global supply

One industry source said it may have done precisely that last week.

With Brent heading toward \$80 a barrel, Saudi Arabia told the market
about an increase in its production last month sooner than it would have
usually released such information, the source, who follows Saudi output
policy, said.

"**[The Saudis will probably put a few more dampening signals out, given
where prices have gone," the industry source said]{.underline}**.

OPEC U-TURN

The aspiration for \$70 to \$80 is similar to that of other producers
within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Algeria,
for example, says it sees \$75 as fair.

"Everybody has been talking about these kinds of numbers," said an OPEC
delegate from outside the Gulf.

**[Brent crude has fluctuated between \$70 and \$80 since April 10.

**[Riyadh has long been a close Washington ally. But ever since Trump

**[The Saudis are entering a period of immense uncertainty as the
kingdom moves forward with]{.underline}** the National Transformation
Plan (NTP) and **[Vision 2030]{.underline}** announced by Deputy Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in April. **[Vision 2030 aims to
streamline the bloated state bureaucracy, increase private sector
investment, and curb youth unemployment in order to end the kingdom's
dependency on oil.]{.underline}**

The NTP and Vision 2030 could make Saudi society more vibrant and
sustainable. Or they could undermine the kingdom's relative stability
and create devastating consequences for the greater Middle East region,
as well as global energy and financial markets.

Although many Arab states faced mounting protests and calls for
political liberalization during 2011's Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia
maintained relative peace and stability. However**[, changes to the
kingdom's socio-economic system could lay the groundwork for similar
dissent by sparking demands for social and political reforms while
undermining Saudi cohesion.]{.underline}**

The Conditions for Collapse

**[To reduce Saudi Arabia's budget deficit, Vision 2030 calls for a
phased reduction of the subsidies offered to Saudi nationals and
promises to increase private sector employment.]{.underline}** If
economic growth and job creation fail to meet expectations,
**[discontent could catalyze demands for liberal political reforms that
will require serious input from the kingdom's clerics.]{.underline}**
Saudi Oger's bankruptcy and expat layoffs may be a sign of labor
shedding that is required system wide. According to Saudi economist Fadl
al-Boainain, "declining corporate profitability has made the foreign
workforce a target for managements seeking to cut fixed financial
obligations." In January, a Saudi businessman speculated that by the end
of 2016 one million expats may leave the country given the financial
squeeze stemming from plunging oil prices.

However, successful implementation could also trigger demands for
greater reform from a rising capital class that is less economically
dependent on the state.

Politically disenfranchised foreign nationals, the majority of Saudi
Arabia's working class, and marginalized Shi'ites in the Eastern
Province would likely echo these demands. Shi'ites, who have
historically faced a great deal of discrimination and extreme poverty,
have a history of anti-Al Saud activism. Ultimately, **[calls for reform
could ignite passionate anti-government protests, leading to uprisings
that could at least create instability even if not triggering its
collapse. To regain control, the regime would deploy the Saudi Arabia
National Guard (SANG), comprised of tribal forces loyal to the monarchy.
There is a key question that Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) observers
are asking: If the Al Saud rulers turn to SANG to maintain their ruler,
where will other power ministries, like the Ministry of Interior and its
army of police forces, fit in this scenario?]{.underline}**

In addition, **[Vision 2030's bureaucratic, social, and economic reforms
could also alienate key elites. The kingdom has used bureaucratic
appointments to ensure support from competing tribal and familial
factions.]{.underline}** Consolidating or replacing these elites with
technocrats would remove their incentive to support the government in
the event of a significant threat. Altering the line of succession to
promote MBS, as has been suggested, **[could engender further resentment
and open hostility within the royal family.]{.underline}** The older
generation of Al Saud leaders do not like bowing down before a young
prince. **[The possibility of greater social reforms could also alienate
the powerful religious establishment that dominates Saudi
society.]{.underline}**

**[Vision 2030's plan to open Saudi Aramco, the nation's state-owned oil
conglomerate, to public investment would also necessitate more
transparency within the secretive company, which could expose high-level
corruption and elite manipulation, further undermining the public's
trust in critical state elites and institutions.]{.underline}**
**["Assessment of Aramco's value by public markets might require the
disclosure of any relevant audits of Saudi oil fields, which rumors
suggest may have been conducted quite recently in
secret"]{.underline}**, wrote Perry Cammack, an associate in the Middle
East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. **["An
IPO would require the company to show a level of transparency
unprecedented in its history, and frankly, just as unprecedented for the
ruling family."]{.underline}**

**[In the event of contentious anti-government uprisings, the monarchy
would feel pressured to offer change.]{.underline}** The most likely
scenario would be the promotion of MBS, a reformer with a great deal of
youth support. **[This promotion is unlikely to quell elite resentment
and could further inflame tensions among the monarchy, rival family
members, and the religious establishment.]{.underline}** If MBS offers
liberal reforms, he would likely lose the support of the
ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics. Yet if he fails to provide reforms,
resistance to the Saudi rulers could grow based on regionalism and
tribalism in the Hijaz, Nejd, or the Eastern Province. Neither scenario
bodes well for the monarchy. Though he has a loyal following in the
military, MBS's military excursion in Yemen has received substantial
criticism, creating the conditions for a coup if destabilization
escalates under his stewardship.

**[Hostile elites with competing clientele bases would see state
collapse as an opening for greater power]{.underline}**. **[Since the
kingdom's unification in 1932, an overarching Saudi identity has been
elusive. Saudi nationalism is a new concept. The state has been united
by the cooptation of elites and the promotion of Wahhabi ideology, which
while popular in the Nejd heartland faces rejection from the country's
Shi'ite minority. Not all Saudi Sunnis, meanwhile, practice this branch
of Sunni Islam.]{.underline}**

With an embattled central state, many **[tribal elites would strive to
carve out autonomous regions, restore their pre-unification authority,
and potentially dissolve the modern Saudi state. To exert their power,
these tribal leaders would draw defections from tribal kin in the armed
forces. Disaffected royal family members with their own loyal bases of
support could also openly challenge King Salman's successor (whoever
that will be) if instability persists.]{.underline}**

**[In the face of significant social upheaval, elite abandonment, and
military defection, the SANG could not realistically prevent the state
from sliding into civil war and collapse. GCC states are aware of this
scenario and operational plans to contain this potential implosion are
already under consideration.]{.underline}**

Consequences for Region and the World

**[The collapse of the Saudi state would have grave implications for the
region and the world]{.underline}**. As illustrated by Libya, Syria, and
Yemen, state collapse **[creates a vacuum for radical jihadist groups to
claim new territory]{.underline}**. Currently,
**[al-Qaeda]{.underline}** in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) **[is pushing
against the Saudi border with Yemen and]{.underline}** the Islamic State
(**[ISIS]{.underline}** or IS) in Iraq and Syria **[poses a constant
threat to the kingdom's north]{.underline}**. Thus**[, civil war,
instability, and high levels of sectarian tension would likely be
fertile ground for these groups to grow and expand their control,
threaten the holy sites, and perpetuate regional
instability]{.underline}**. Washington's national security establishment
has expressed concerns about turmoil escalating in Saudi Arabia if MBS's
reform agenda fails to achieve its objectives. Some see the kingdom at a
crossroads and fear that the kingdom's collapse would benefit the
Islamic State. Regarding MBS possibly becoming the next king, one
anonymous Saudi expert told NBC News, "It's him or it's ISIS."

The July 4 attacks in three Saudi cities (Medina, Jeddah, and Qatif)
underscored the significance of the militant Salafist-Jihadist threat
not only to the country's security but also Al Saud's prestige and
Islamic legitimacy as the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The
intended attack by IS adherents on the Prophet's Mosque during the end
of Ramadan signals the Islamic State's intent to usurp the Al Saud much
as the apocalyptic leader Juhayman al-Otaybi did when he seized the
Grand Mosque in 1979. "This attack has made it very clear that ISIS does
not seem to believe in any moral red lines whatsoever," said Fahad
Nazer, a leading expert on Saudi Arabia. "Even al-Qaeda, which is
certainly brutal in its own right, has never targeted Muslims in their
houses of worship. ISIS has done that repeatedly."

**[A civil war in the Arabian Peninsula would also challenge
long-standing alliances. Instability]{.underline}**, **[the threat to
the holy cities, and the possibility of jihadist gains would encourage
states with high stakes]{.underline}** (**[Egypt, Jordan, Iran,
Pakistan, U.S., etc]{.underline}**.) **[to react]{.underline}**. In
fact, **[UAE officials have even made contingency plans for a potential
state collapse in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, a risk which none of the
kingdom's neighbors can afford to ignore**[. These states would
certainly move to secure the holy sites and combat terror cells, but
solving the civil war would be a massive challenge]{.underline}**. There
would be considerable pressure to support the Saud family, but
supporting the Wahhabi religious establishment over a reform movement
would cause domestic complications in some of these countries that
resent the kingdom's influence across the region.

**[Pakistan]{.underline}**, which has a "special bilateral relationship"
with Saudi Arabia obligating their military to defend Mecca and Medina
and protect Saudi Arabia's territorial integrity, **[would face the most
pressure to intervene militarily on behalf of the Saud government should
turmoil intensify]{.underline}**. **[The two nations have a long history
of military and security cooperation]{.underline}**, and **[there is
little doubt that Pakistan would act to protect the Al Saud
rulers]{.underline}**. In addition, **[the Egyptian military is present
in the northern border areas of Saudi Arabia helping to augment
Pakistani forces supporting SANG and the Saudi border
guard.]{.underline}**

Iran and Oil

**[The geopolitical tsunami that would result from Saudi Arabia's
collapse would have enormous consequences regarding Iranian influence
across the region.]{.underline}** From Iraq to Lebanon, and from Yemen
to Syria, **[the struggle on the part of hardline Sunni Islamists to
counter Shi'ism and Iran's reach would enter a new phase should Saudi
Arabia cease to exist as a unified nation-state.]{.underline}** **[It is
not entirely clear how Iran would react to state-collapse in Saudi
Arabia, especially considering instability in the region would present a
security risk to shipping and trade in the Persian Gulf.]{.underline}**
Although **[Iran would likely avoid direct involvement in a conflict in
the Arabian Peninsula, it would certainly attempt to capitalize on a
regional power vacuum created by a diminished Saudi Arabia by
consolidating its political and military influence in Yemen, Iraq,
Syria, Eastern Saudi Arabia, and, if instability spreads,
Shi'ite-majority Bahrain. Diminished oil output by its regional rival
would also increase demand for Iranian oil, boosting their
economy.]{.underline}** There is also no clear Sunni successor state to
check Iran's regional influence. **[Egypt's economy is too weak, and
Jordan is surrounded on all sides by instability.]{.underline}**

Finally, **[Saudi Arabia as a failed state would send international
markets into free fall. State collapse in Saudi Arabia would halt oil
production, significantly increasing the price of oil and dramatically
weakening global economies.]{.underline}** **[Such an increase would
spark a severe global economic crisis]{.underline}**. The longer Saudi
Arabia is destabilized, the more difficult it would be for the world to
pull out of the crisis and recover. **[The socio-political ramifications
of such an economic shock could be catastrophic and disastrous for both
the region and the world. If the government faces large-scale
demonstrations calling for social and political liberalization while
facing tribal, familial, and religious elite abandonment, the result
could be instability, civil war, and/or state collapse.]{.underline}**

Again this result is far from inevitable. The Saudis might be able to
successfully implement the Vision 2030 reforms while ensuring elite and
citizen support. The country must also be open to course corrections in
the event of economic turmoil or elite resentment in order to prevent
instability.

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness -- Low Prices

#### Oil prices are low and stable

**Krauss, national energy business correspondent, 19** \[Clifford
Krauss, 6/5/19, New York Times, "Another Sign of Economic Worry:
Tumbling Oil Prices",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/business/energy-environment/oil-price.html>,
accessed 6/28/19\]//CJ

A couple of months ago, the bulls ran the oil markets. Now **[the bears
have taken over]{.underline}**.

**[Always volatile, oil prices have tumbled more than 20 percent since
late April because of growing fears that demand is weaker than expected
as the global economy slows. Investors are also worried that President
Trump's trade war with China and his threat to put tariffs on imports
from Mexico could depress growth even more. On Wednesday, crude oil
futures in the United States closed at \$51.68 a barrel, down 3.4
percent for the day, even as the stock market closed
higher.]{.underline}**

The outlook for oil prices was much different just six weeks ago, when
the Trump administration was tightening sanctions on two leading
producers, Iran and Venezuela, and civil war was breaking out around
Libya's capital. Some **[analysts speculated that there wouldn't be
enough oil to go around and that prices could jump to \$90 a barrel or
even higher.]{.underline}**

"Everybody is surprised and now doubting projections of global demand
growth," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price
Information Service. "It's not as though there has been a rapprochement
with Iran. It's not as though there has been an increase in the rig
count in the United States or Canada."

The decline of crude oil prices is just one of the many signals that
markets have sent in recent weeks darkening the outlook for the global
economy. Prices for other industrial commodities such as copper, nickel
and steel have declined. Stock markets in countries highly dependent on
global trade, such as South Korea, Japan, Germany and Taiwan, have also
fallen.

The same economic fears that have driven down yields on Treasury notes
and bonds appear to be driving down the price of oil.

"It is an indicator," said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "As we assess the economy's vulnerabilities,
this is one of the things we're looking at."

The latest sign that demand is weaker than expected came on Wednesday
when a government report showed that fuel inventories in the United
States were rising. Supplies are usually tight in early June as the
summer driving season gets underway.

Supplies of crude oil were up by nearly seven million barrels for the
week, the highest level in two years.

The American oil benchmark has swung up and down over the last year. The
price now is nearly the same as it was three years earlier, when prices
first recovered from a sharp drop in 2014 and 2015 to below \$30 a
barrel.

I**[n recent days, many analysts had predicted that oil prices would
soon rebound, just as they had after they tumbled late last year when
the Trump administration made it easier for countries like Japan and
India to continue buying oil from Iran without running afoul of American
sanctions.]{.underline}**

The Trump administration has recently said it will become stricter about
enforcing sanctions against Iran and do more to curb Venezuelan oil
exports, too. That, along with violence in Libya and the decision by
many oil companies to cut their 2019 exploration budgets, led analysts
to conclude that oil prices would move up.

**[But the opposite has happened.]{.underline}**

**[Many analysts said the fall in oil prices was at least partly driven
by short-term factors. Investors had been buying oil future contracts
for several months, expecting higher prices. Those traders began
reversing those bets in early May when it appeared that the United
States and China were not as close to a trade deal as many people had
assumed.]{.underline}**

### Link -- Retaliation

#### Saudi Arabia would retaliate by spiking oil prices

**Torchia, Reuters Chief Economic Correspondent, and Mohammed, Reuters
Foreign Policy Correspondent, 18**

\[Andrew Torchia and Arshad Mohammed, 10-15-2018, \"Saudi Arabia says
will retaliate against any sanctions over\...,\" U.S.,
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-politics-dissident-sanctions/saudi-arabia-says-will-retaliate-against-any-sanctions-over-khashoggi-case-idUSKCN1MO0F1,
accessed 6-26-2019, //CM\]

**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** on Sunday **[warned against threats to
punish it]{.underline}** over last week's disappearance of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, as European leaders piled on pressure and two more U.S.
executives scrapped plans to attend a Saudi investor conference.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of
Riyadh's policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body
removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened "severe punishment" if it
turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, though he said
Washington would be "punishing" itself if it halted military sales to
Riyadh.

"**[The Kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts
to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions,
using political pressures, or repeating false accusations," the official
Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted an unnamed official as
saying.]{.underline}**

"**[The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will
respond with greater action, and that the Kingdom's economy has an
influential and vital role in the global economy," the official added,
without elaborating.]{.underline}**

The Saudi Embassy in Washington later tweeted what it called a
clarification, thanking countries including the United States "for
refraining from jumping to conclusions" over the case.

In a sign Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud may seek a diplomatic
solution to the incident, he stressed the strength of Saudi-Turkish ties
in a telephone call with President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, the Saudi
press agency said late on Sunday.

The king thanked Erdogan for welcoming a Saudi proposal to form a joint
working group to discuss Khashoggi's disappearance and said no one could
undermine their relationship. EUROPE SEEKS CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION

Europe's largest economies --- Britain, France and Germany --- said on
Sunday they were treating the case with "the utmost seriousness".

"There needs to be a credible investigation to establish the truth about
what happened, and - if relevant - to identify those bearing
responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and ensure that
they are held to account," the countries said in a joint statement.

"We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the
Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response. We have
conveyed this message directly to the Saudi authorities."

The statement, by Britain's Jeremy Hunt, France's Jean-Yves Le Drian and
Germany's Heiko Maas, made no mention of potential actions the countries
might take. Hunt later said that if Saudi Arabia were proven to be
guilty, "we would have to think about the appropriate way to react in
that situation."

OIL PRICE WARNING

**[In a column published just after the SPA statement, Saudi-owned Al
Arabiya channel's General Manager Turki Aldakhil warned that imposing
sanctions on the world's largest oil exporter could spark global
economic disaster.]{.underline}**

"**[It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure to commit to producing 7.5
million barrels. If the price of oil reaching \$80 angered President
Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or \$200, or
even double that figure," he wrote.]{.underline}**

**[Investor concern is growing that Khashoggi's disappearance could add
to a sense that Saudi policy has become more unpredictable under Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing social and economic reforms
but has also presided over a rise in tensions between with several
countries.]{.underline}**

A Gulf banker said the **[Khashoggi case, combined with other events,
had become a significant factor for some potential
investors.]{.underline}**

"**[It's cumulative -- the Yemen war, the dispute with Qatar, the
tensions with Canada and Germany, the arrests of women activists. They
add up to an impression of impulsive policy-making, and that worries
investors]{.underline}**," the banker said.

Foreign capital is key to Saudi plans for economic diversification and
job creation.

But in response to Khashoggi's disappearance, media organizations and a
growing number of executives have pulled out of a Riyadh investment
conference scheduled for next week, dubbed "Davos in the Desert."

On Sunday, JP Morgan Chase & Co said Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has
canceled plans to attend the Saudi Arabian investor conference later
this month. Ford Motor Co said Chairman Bill Ford has canceled his trip
to the Middle East, which included an appearance at the Saudi investment
conference.

JP Morgan Chase and Ford did not comment on whether the decision was
related to concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin still plans to attend the
conference, but that could change, Larry Kudlow, director of the White
House National Economic Council, said on ABC's "This Week". WASHINGTON
REACTS

**[U.S. senators called for reactions ranging from boycotting an
upcoming economic summit in Riyadh to ending support for Saudi military
operations in Yemen.]{.underline}**

"If they lured this man into that consulate, they went medieval on him,
and he was killed and he was chopped up and they sent a death crew down
there to kill him and do all of this, that would be an outrage," Florida
Senator Marco Rubio told CNN's State of the Union.

"Just because they are an ally in an important mission, which is
containing Iranian expansion in the region, cannot allow us to overlook
or walk away from that."

Fellow Republican, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, appearing on "This Week",
called for "severe action" which he said would affect arms sales and
involvement in Yemen.

**[The Saudi stock market fell as much as 7 percent in early trade on
Sunday, one of the first signs of economic pain Riyadh could suffer over
the affair. By close, it had recovered some losses, ending down 3.5
percent and losing \$16.5 billion of market value.]{.underline}**

Senators have triggered a provision of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights
Accountability Act requiring the president to determine whether a
foreign person is responsible for a gross human rights violation. The
act has in the past imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian
officials.

**[Anti-Saudi sentiment in the U.S. Congress could conceivably raise
pressure to pass the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, which
would end sovereign immunity shielding OPEC members from U.S. legal
action.]{.underline}**

ACCESSING CONSULATE

The crisis has polarized Saudis, with some blaming the nation's enemies
and others concerned about the direction the country is heading under
Prince Mohammed.

Prince Khaled al-Faisal, a senior member of Saudi Arabia's ruling family
and senior advisor to King Salman, has met Erdogan to discuss
Khashoggi's disappearance, two sources with knowledge of the matter told
Reuters without providing details.

A Turkish official told Reuters on Sunday that the Saudis had said they
would allow the consulate to be searched, and that this would happen by
the end of the weekend, though he conceded to "flexibility on this
date."

"But Turkey is determined on the subject of entering the consulate and
carrying out a criminal inspection. There is no alternative to carrying
out this inspection. Time is important in terms of evidence," the
official said.

#### Saudi Arabia would retaliate by spiking oil prices to [\$100]{.underline} or more

international oil engineer expert, 18**

\[Robert Rapier, 10-23-2018, \"Saudi Arabia Proves That Oil Is Power,\"

accessed 6-26-2019, //CM\]

According to the 2018 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, in 2017
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** produced 12 million barrels of oil per
day. That **[accounted for 12.9% of the world\'s oil production, which
is in the range of the world\'s two other major oil production
superpowers \-- Russia and the U.S.]{.underline}**

However, **[there is an important distinction when it comes to Saudi
Arabia. In Russia, oil production is concentrated among a dozen or so
companies. In the U.S., thousands of companies acting in their own
self-interest produce oil]{.underline}**. But **[in Saudi Arabia, all of
the oil production is controlled by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil
company and reportedly the most profitable company in the
world.]{.underline}**

**[Given]{.underline}** that **[Saudi Arabia\'s share of oil production
is]{.underline}** well beyond the spare production capacity of the
world\'s most important commodity, Saudi Arabia has incredible economic
power. **[All Saudi Arabia would have to do is withhold three or four
million barrels of oil per day from the market, and prices would quickly
rise above \$100/barrel.]{.underline}**

Some analysts have floated the idea **[of oil prices getting as high as
\$200 or even \$400/bbl in the event of a disruption in Saudi\'s
petroleum output.]{.underline}** That may seem preposterous, but keep
**[in]{.underline}** mind that during the **[1973 oil embargo, oil
prices quadrupled in about six months]{.underline}**. **[Prices like
that would quickly push the global economy into
recessio]{.underline}**n, as it helped do in 1973. That is the power
Saudi Arabia holds.

**[Consider the oil price movements since 2014.]{.underline}** **[Oil
prices plunged because Saudi Arabia sought to win market share back from
the shale oil producers. So, OPEC flooded the market with oil, which
sent prices down by over 70%.]{.underline}**

Then, when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, **[Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports.]{.underline}**

**[No other entity in the world has as much power to move the oil
markets. Saudi Arabia could quickly bring the global economy to its
knees.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, as the world debates a harsh punishment for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
earlier this month, **[they really hold the trump card. \$100 billion in
potential arms sales is small potatoes considering the havoc Saudi
Arabia could unleash if it decided to use oil as an economic
weapon.]{.underline}**

This is just one price we pay for our dependence on oil**[. Global
economic security will continue to depend strongly on the cooperation of
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}**

**[The United States and Saudi Arabia have had a mutually dependent
relationship for seven decades based on a central bargain: the kingdom
would pump oil and the superpower would provide security.]{.underline}**

The interests that bind, and sometimes divide, the two range from the
price of oil and containing Iran, to counter-terrorism, the wars in
Syria and Yemen, Saudi investment in the United States and efforts to
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Relations have been strained by the Oct. 2 disappearance of Saudi
journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi when he
visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered
and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that but, according to
published reports, may be considering describing the incident as an
attempted rendition gone wrong.

Below are descriptions of the leverage each side has and the risks of
exercising it.

OIL

**[As the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has some ability to
flood the market to depress oil prices or to curb supply and raise
them.]{.underline}**

**[The kingdom generally seeks a sweet spot to maximize current oil
revenues without endangering future earnings]{.underline}**, which could
happen if prices rose so high that they chilled demand or encouraged
development of alternatives.

Saudi Arabia needs oil revenue to fund state expenses and its Public
Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund slated to play a leading role
in its drive to develop non-oil industries.

On Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted **[an unnamed Saudi
official making a veiled threat to respond to pressure by tinkering with
oil supplies.]{.underline}**

With the boom in production of U.S. shale oil, the United States is less
dependent on imported oil.

However, **[a Saudi decision to shrink global oil supplies and raise
prices could hurt U.S. President Donald Trump by slowing economic growth
and denting his 2020 re-election prospects]{.underline}**.

**[It could also undercut the U.S. effort to shrink Iran's oil
revenues]{.underline}**, part of a wider U.S. strategy of forcing Tehran
to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for
proxies in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. High oil prices would raise
Iran's revenues just as Washington wants to reduce them.

Trump called Saudi King Salman on Sept. 29 to discuss efforts to
maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic
growth, Saudi state news agency SPA reported.

ARMS SALES

Trump has sent mixed signals on whether he wishes to punish Saudi Arabia
for Khashoggi's disappearance.

While Trump on Saturday promised "severe punishment" for Saudi Arabia if
Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, **[he has stressed his reluctance
to halt U.S. arms sales, saying this would cost U.S. jobs and benefit
Russian and Chinese companies.]{.underline}**

Arms expert William Hartung of the Center for International Policy, a
U.S. research and advocacy group, argued the installed base of U.S.
aircraft and other military systems in Saudi Arabia made it unlikely
Russia or China could supplant U.S. dealers.

The U.S. Congress could act on its own to stop arms sales.

"I'm going to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia," Sen. Lindsey
Graham told Fox News, adding in a separate interview with Fox News
Radio, "I would suspend arms sales as long as he (Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman) is in charge."

However, Congress is on recess until Nov. 13 and lawmakers' outrage
could wane before they return.

### Link -- Oil Infrastructure

#### Without arms, even small terrorist attacks could shock the oil market

**Turak, editor for CNBC, 19** \[Natasha Turak, CNBC, 5/14/19, "Oil
prices jump as Saudi energy minister reports drone 'terrorism' against
pipeline infrastructure",
<https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/14/oil-jumps-as-saudi-energy-minister-reports-drone-terrorism-against-pipeline.html>,
accessed 6/28/19\]//CJ

DUBAI --- **[Oil prices rose sharply Tuesday morning on reports of a
drone attack at oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**.

The incident is an "act of terrorism," Saudi Energy Minister Khalid
al-Falih said according to the Saudi state news agency SPA, describing
attacks on two oil pumping stations **[near Riyadh for the country's
East-West pipeline carried out with bomb-laden drones.]{.underline}**

**[Brent crude futures were up 1.7% at \$71.39 a barrel. U.S. West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at \$61.86 per barrel, up
1.2%.]{.underline}**

The fire has since been contained, according to the SPA. Al-Falih
asserted that oil production was not interrupted. State oil company
Saudi Aramco said that its oil and gas supplies to Europe have not been
affected, and that no one was injured.

"This act of terrorism and sabotage in addition to recent acts in the
Arabian Gulf do not only target the Kingdom but also the security of
world oil supplies and the global economy," the SPA described al-Falih
as saying.

No one has yet been directly accused of carrying out the attack, but a
Yemeni Houthi-run TV channel announced on Tuesday morning it had
launched drone attacks on several Saudi installations.

The channel Masirah TV, citing a Houthi military official, reported that
"seven drones carried out attacks on vital Saudi installations."

Al-Falih, according to the SPA statement, said: "These attacks prove
again that it is important for us to face **[terrorist entities,
including the Houthi militias in Yemen that are backed by
Iran."]{.underline}**

**[Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran, have been fighting
Saudi Arabia in their country since the kingdom launched an offensive
against it in early 2015 in defense of its internationally-recognized
government, which the Houthis had overthrown]{.underline}**. The more
than four-year long conflict has been deemed by the UN as the world's
worst humanitarian crisis.

The exchange, which joined the MSCI emerging markets index this year as
part of the country's economic diversification agenda, dropped 2.7% on
Monday on government reports that two Saudi oil tankers were among four
vessels targeted in an unspecified "sabotage attack" off the United Arab
Emirates coast of Fujeirah.

**[The series of incidents have ramped up tensions in the oil-rich
region, where the reported sabotage attack on the commercial vessels
Sunday has spiked fears of possible conflict with regional rival Iran.
The escalation could threaten the Strait of Hormuz, a critical choke
point for some 30% of the world's seaborne oil.]{.underline}**

The news also follows a week of increasingly provocative language
exchanged between Washington and Tehran.

Citing "very real" threats coming from Iran, but withholding specific
details, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized during an interview
with CNBC on Sunday that all options --- military and otherwise --- were
on the table in case Iran "makes a bad decision."

Tehran announced last week that it would return to higher levels of
uranium enrichment, breaching the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, if Europe
did not protect it from the impact of U.S. sanctions, which have
crippled Iran's economy.

This followed the White House pushing news of a U.S. strike group
carrier in the Gulf to send an "unmistakable" message to Iran. Although
the ship was on a routine deployment, the administration's announcement
signaled its preparedness for confrontation.

With the growing volume of military hardware occupying the Persian Gulf,
analysts and foreign officials fear a miscalculation or misunderstanding
could spark a serious conflict.

British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters on Monday: "We are
very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an
escalation that is unintended."

#### The aff leaves Saudi oil infrastructure vulnerable to terrorism---multiplied by lack of US backing 

**Reed, Middle East & energy analyst for NYT, 19** \[Stanley Reed,
5/17/19, New York Times, "Saudi Oil Infrastructure at Risk as Small
Attacks Raise Potential for Big Disruption",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/middleeast/saudi-oil-risk.html>,
accessed 6/27/19\]//CJ

Across the Arabian peninsula, thousands of miles of pipes run above and
below the desert in one of the world's most sophisticated production
lines for pumping oil from the ground and distributing it around the
world. This vast system of oil fields, refineries and ports has largely
run like clockwork despite political turbulence across the region.

Then **[a drone strike claimed by Houthi rebels on May 14 forced the
Saudis to temporarily halt the flow of a crucial oil artery to the
western side of the country]{.underline}**. The assault came **[a day
after mysterious incidents damaged two Saudi tankers and two other ships
in a key port in the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}**.

These were perhaps the **[most serious attacks on the kingdom's oil
infrastructure since Al Qaeda militants were thwarted trying to blow up
a key Saudi facility at Abqaiq in 2006.]{.underline}**

While American officials are still trying to determine whether Iran was
behind these incidents, the question for the oil market is **[how well
the Saudi and Persian Gulf infrastructure is protected and whether, with
tensions building in the region, it could survive a conflict with
Iran]{.underline}**.

Analysts and executives of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, say
the kingdom has spent heavily to protect the industry that is its
lifeblood. Key **[Saudi installations are tightly guarded and protected
by missile batteries and other weaponry.]{.underline}**

"Security systems were bulked up in the 2000s amid the Al Qaeda threat,
including the 2006 attack on the Abqaiq facility," said Ben Cahill,
manager for research and advisory at Energy Intelligence, a research
firm. "The country's oil fields, refineries and pipelines are blanketed
by surveillance and remote sensing."

In light of that security effort, Mr. Cahill and other analysts concede
that it was eye-opening, even shocking, that a drone apparently launched
from as far as 500 miles away in Yemen, managed to cross deep into Saudi
Arabia and cause damage.

It was also worrisome and even embarrassing that someone managed to
damage tankers in waters off Fujairah, a vital port in the United Arab
Emirates where ships take on fuel and provisions on their way in and out
of the Gulf.

Despite the security spending of the last decade, rapid changes in
technology may mean that the Saudi infrastructure is more exposed than
previously thought, analysts say. United Nations experts have estimated,
for instance, that drones used by the Houthis have a range of nearly
1,000 miles, allowing them to reach well into Saudi Arabia.

"The simple fact that they managed to reach tankers and a pipeline" is
meaningful, said Riccardo Fabiani, a geopolitical analyst at Energy
Aspects, a market research firm. "It means they could strike at the
heart of Saudi interests if they wanted to."

Iran is well-placed for inflicting pain in the no-war-no-peace existence
in the region. Analysts say it is proficient at using relatively cheap
unconventional weapons like drones and speedboats, and at covering its
tracks. It can also make use of proxies including the Houthi rebels, who
claimed responsibility for the pipeline attack.

Analysts say that drones could prove to be a nuisance for producers like
the Saudis. It would be difficult if not impossible to protect an entire
pipeline system, and even concentrating air defense units around key
points like pumping stations, which were hit in the May 14 drone
strikes, would mean taking these defenses from somewhere else.

Drones may also be able to evade the kingdom's main air defenses, which
are intended to repel missiles and aircraft rather than smaller objects.

Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East and Africa defense specialist at Jane's
Defense Weekly, said that satellite imagery showed that the key Saudi
export terminal at Ras Tanura was guarded by batteries of sophisticated
United States-made Hawk surface-to-air missiles. But these weapons
"might not be able to engage the UAVs (drones) that Iran has developed
with small radar cross sections," he said.

Another concern is that Iran, which is regarded as skilled in digital
hacking, could use cyber warfare to damage the petroleum infrastructure
of Saudi Arabia and its neighbors.

At Saudi Aramco, activities like drilling wells, pumping oil to the
surface, and loading the fuel on tankers can all be monitored and
managed remotely. Such sophistication, though, may also create openings
for attack.

"A lot of those movements are run out of a central command center at
Saudi Aramco headquarters," said Phillip Cornell, a fellow at the
Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research institution, who
previously worked at Aramco as a senior corporate planning adviser.

Mr. Cornell said that Aramco officials suspected that Iran was
responsible for a cyber attack earlier in this decade and that "there
has been a lot of investment to reinforce those cyber security
defenses."

However, analysts say the cyber vulnerabilities remain a major worry. "I
think cyber is the really underappreciated risk," said Helima Croft, an
oil analyst at RBC Capital markets, an investment bank.

Cyber attacks, for instance, could play a surprisingly large role in the
event of conflict, gumming up the oil system or even causing damage.

"Iran has significant cyber capabilities and in the event of a
significant U.S. military action against Iran, one could expect that
they might deploy these capabilities against the U.S. and its allies,"
said John MacWilliams, who was an associate deputy secretary and chief
risk officer in the Department of Energy in the Obama administration.

Mr. MacWilliams said the Pentagon monitored Iran's cyber skills and
probably had plans to counter them. "It is one more important reason
that containing military action from spreading quickly to a larger
conflict may prove difficult," he said.

The evidence, so far, is that the market and the oil industry can take
some bumps in stride. Oil prices ticked up slightly in the week of the
two attacks, to \$72 a barrel for Brent crude, but still remained below
the high of nearly \$75 a barrel in late April.

"What the market thinks is that although these incidents are important
and noteworthy, they have so far not had any impact on actual production
or exports," said Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets
division of the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based
multinational group.

Analysts also say that oil installations are resilient, with most damage
easily and quickly repaired. The Saudis have been through a series of
wars in the Gulf and have rejiggered their installations with potential
threats in mind. "They don't have a prayer," said Sadad I. Husseini, a
former executive vice president of Aramco, speaking of the possibility
of serious disruptions of the kingdom's oil exports.

**[In the event of a major conflict, some analysts figure that the large
presence of United States military forces in the area would mean that
Iran would have only limited success if it tried to stop oil flows from
the Gulf.]{.underline}**

"Iran is still a very limited military power if things escalate," said
Anthony H. Cordesman, a Gulf defense expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington. Mr. Cordesman added that the
consequences of a conflict in the region "would be higher prices and
limited flows, not a prolonged closing of the Gulf."

With territory along most of the eastern side of the Gulf, including the
vital Strait of Hormuz, Iran is well positioned to cause trouble. Mr.
Binnie said that in a war situation Iran could fire anti-ship missiles
with radars that fasten onto large targets. "Tankers would be extremely
vulnerable in that scenario," he said.

**[Iranian personnel could also harass commercial and military ships
with small boats equipped with missiles or torpedoes, and by dropping
mines in the Strait. Nearly a fifth of the world's crude oil travels the
sea lanes through that gauntlet, which at its narrowest point is just 21
miles wide.]{.underline}**

Wars are unpredictable, the analysts said, and the outcome of a conflict
between Iran, the United States, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers
would carry substantial risks.

Washington's sanctions on Iran have already more than halved the
country's oil sales. **[As they continue to fall, Tehran may be tempted
to take greater risks.]{.underline}**

"The Trump administration really needs to understand what it is doing by
clamping down on Iran," said Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice
University's Baker Institute. "If Iran does not have any exports, it has
a lot less to lose."

### Link -- Trump Expectation

#### Saudi Arabia would blast Trump on oil if he broke his promises and allegiance

prices 'through the roof'",

accessed 6/27/19\]//CJ

**[President Donald Trump on Tuesday linked his decision to continue
backing Saudi Arabia --- despite the murder of a U.S. resident by Saudi
agents --- to his desire to keep oil prices low.]{.underline}**

"**[Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would
go through the roof]{.underline}**," Trump told reporters on Tuesday.
"I've kept them down. They've helped me keep them down."

Trump issued a statement earlier on Tuesday saying the United States
stands by Saudi Arabia after agents of the kingdom killed U.S. resident
and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.

The CIA has reportedly concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
an ally to the Trump administration, ordered Khashoggi's death. On
Tuesday, Trump cast doubt on that assessment, saying in his statement
"maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"

The United States has sanctioned 17 individuals connected to the
killing. U.S. lawmakers have called for the United States to suspend
some arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

**[Trump's comments on Tuesday illustrate how his administration has
relied on Saudi Arabia to pump more oil and convince a group of
producers to increase output in order to keep prices low. Trump's
declaration of support for Saudi Arabia comes just two weeks before
OPEC]{.underline}**, Russia and several other producers meet to decide
whether to reverse course and cut production next year.

The cost of crude began rising earlier this year as Trump prepared to
restore sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third biggest oil producer. **[On
Tuesday, Trump said Saudi Arabia had helped him prevent oil prices from
spiking above \$100 a barrel.]{.underline}**

"Right now we have oil prices in great shape. I'm not going to destroy
the world economy, and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our
country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia," he said.

"I think the statement was pretty obvious what I said. It's about
America First."

In May, Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear accord with
Iran, against the wishes of U.S. allies in Europe that helped negotiate
the deal alongside U.S. diplomats. Saudi Arabia is Iran's chief rival
for regional influence and backed Trump's exit from the 2015 Iran
nuclear deal.

U.S. sanctions on Iran's energy, banking and shipping sectors snapped
back into place on Nov. 5. One month before that, oil prices spiked to
four-year highs as the market braced for a potential shortage of crude.

That rally has since unwound, with crude futures plunging about 30
percent on concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth and the
view that oil supply will outstrip demand next year. Trump's decision to
allow some of Iran's biggest customers to continue buying crude from the
Islamic Republic contributed to the pullback.

Saudi Arabia and its allies are now considering cutting output by 1
million to 1.4 million barrels per day to prevent a price-crushing crude
glut. Trump recently took to Twitter to urge the Saudis and OPEC against
throttling back output.

**[Trump also said he wants to preserve billions of dollars in potential
U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which is facing mounting criticism for
its invasion of neighboring Yemen.]{.underline}** The conflict has
created the world's worst current humanitarian disaster, with both the
Saudi-led coalition and Iran -backed Houthi rebels accused of war
crimes.

Democratic leaders lambasted Trump's statement on Tuesday.

"We should immediately end support to the Saudis in the war in Yemen and
bring that conflict to an end, suspend arms sales to the Kingdom, and
diminish our reliance on Riyadh regarding other matters in the region,"
said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

### Yes Spikes

#### Yes \$100 -- spikes real and possible

https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-Case-For-100-Oil.html,
accessed 6-27-2019, //CM\]

**[The odds of an oil price spike this year are much higher than the
prevailing consensus in the market, according to a new report from Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.]{.underline}**

**[The oil market has been tightening rapidly this year]{.underline}**,
due to **[OPEC+ cuts taking supply off of the market]{.underline}**,
**[outages in Iran and Venezuela, and a slowdown in U.S.
shale]{.underline}**. But **[forthcoming regulations from
the]{.underline}** International Maritime Organization
(**[IMO]{.underline}**) **[could provide an additional jolt,
particularly as global inventories decline against the backdrop of a
tightening market.]{.underline}**

"Now, with distillate inventories at the low end of the range, **[we see
an analogy to 2007/08 when the world run out of diesel refining
capacity]{.underline}**," Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note
on April 12. "**[Back then, as Saudi Arabia lifted heavy crude
production to meet rising global demand for distillates,
diesel-to-bunker fuel spreads blew out and so did light-heavy crude
spreads. A similar situation could develop over the coming months as
ship owners temporarily up their distillate burn to transition out of
high sulphur into ultra low sulpur bunker fuel due to the new IMO2020
rules]{.underline}**."

There are important differences between today and the price spike of
2008, Bank of America notes, including greater spare capacity in
2019**[, an additional 1.1 million barrels per day (mb/d) of refining
capacity set to come online, and the expectation that U.S. shale could
quickly add supply in the event of higher oil prices]{.underline}**.
"**[Still, unlike the gradual tightening in diesel markets of 2007/08,
the world faces a major one-off jump in distillate
demand]{.underline}**," Bank of America argues, referring to worldwide
regulations on marine fuels set to take effect at the start of 2020.

**[The rules lower the limit of sulfur concentration in marine fuels
from 3.5 percent to just 0.5 percent, which will force shipowners to
switch away from heavy fuel oils. Instead, the alternatives include
scrubbing technology and a greater use of low-sulfur fuels, including
distillates.]{.underline}**

Bank of America says that **[the regulations could push up distillate
demand by 1.1 mb/d year-on-year, which comes on top of the 0.5 mb/d
annual trend growth rate, and also on top of the cyclical high during
winter]{.underline}**. **[Higher distillate demand could push up crude
oil prices as refiners race to turn crude into
distillates.]{.underline}** "About **[60% of the average crude barrel
can be turned into distillate with the right refining toolkit. But that
figure drops below 50% for heavy oil, potentially curbing supply," Bank
of America wrote. The bottom line is that there is a chance that oil
prices rise much higher this year. "In our view, the risk of a Brent
crude oil price spike is significantly higher than options markets
suggest," Bank of America warned.]{.underline}**

### Yes \$100

#### \$100 oil uniquely possible now and triggers a recession

**DiChristopher, award winning CNBC energy journalist, 2018**

\[Tom Dichristopher, 5-22-2018, "UBS warns there could be an oil price
spike to \$100 that triggers a US recession," CNBC,

**[Oil prices have broken out of a "sweet spot" for global economic
growth and could herald a U.S. recession if they keep
rising]{.underline}**, UBS warns.

The Swiss investment bank on Tuesday joined a chorus of financial
institutions in **[pondering the economic impact of oil prices at \$100
a barrel]{.underline}**. Crude futures are trading near their highest
levels in 3½ years, bolstered by strong demand, supply cuts from big
producers, and mounting geopolitical tension in the Middle East and
Venezuela.

**[International benchmark Brent crude has surged nearly 48 percent over
the last year and has traded above \$80 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude
is up 43 percent, near \$72 a barrel. When oil prices rise sharply, it
raises the cost of fuel and shrinks the amount of money consumers have
to spend in the broader economy. But when the cost of crude falls too
much, it weighs on growth in oil-producing nations.]{.underline}**

**[Until recently, oil prices fell in a range between those two poles,
according to UBS.]{.underline}**

**["However, now that we are getting closer to \$100/bbl the net impact
of higher oil prices is again becoming a net negative]{.underline}**,"
UBS economists said in a research note. **["The global sweet spot ---
where oil prices may have positively contributed to global growth ---
seems to be somewhere between \$50/bbl and \$70/bbl."]{.underline}**

**[Oil prices at \$100 a barrel would knock UBS' estimate for global
growth in 2019 down from 4 percent to 3.86 percent. It says global
inflation would top out at 4 percent if prices hit that level, up from
the bank's current forecast for a 3.1 percent increase in consumer
prices in July.]{.underline}**

To be sure, those economic impacts would be felt very differently across
the globe --- UBS assessed the fallout for 15 different nations --- but
it certainly raises risks in the United States.

"**[We should take seriously the possibility of an oil price spike \...
not least because oil spikes preceded 5 of the last 6 recessions (in the
US),"]{.underline}** UBS said.

**[The crude price rally this past year marks the 11th biggest oil price
spike in the last 70 years]{.underline}**, according to UBS. The bank's
economists warn the rally could continue to grind higher for several
reasons.

**[A deal among OPEC, Russia and other producers to cut output and drain
a crude glut has shrunk oil stockpiles. Meanwhile, geopolitical tension
and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are creating uncertainty about
future oil supply. Finally, while U.S. production is surging, it can't
keep pace with growing demand, and UBS thinks underinvestment in big oil
projects will start to impact supply next year.]{.underline}**

While this year's spike ranks among the biggest in history, UBS notes
that it is still smaller than rallies that preceded recessions in the
past.

**[Global oil prices also remain below levels throughout much of
2005-2015, once they're adjusted for inflation. Fuel efficiency
improvements also mean the world needs less oil today to produce one
unit of economic activity.]{.underline}**

**[Another factor that would minimize the impact of higher oil prices is
surging U.S. output. Now that the United States accounts for a bigger
share of global oil production, it means that the world's biggest
economy gets a bigger boost from rising oil prices. Still, UBS says
another \$20 rise in oil prices won't bring much new production
online.]{.underline}**

**[Oil prices rose above \$100 a barrel in 2008 and then hit \$145.29 on
July 3 that summer. Yet it seemed unimaginable that crude could pass the
\$100 mark again]{.underline}**. However, **[several factors have
started to push the price above \$70, and experts say that \$80, \$90 or
even \$100 oil could be back by this year's end.]{.underline}**

**[It did not take crude long to hit \$100 in 2008]{.underline}**. It
traded at \$71 in August 2007, about the same price it is today. It was
\$96 by December and rising fast. The price stayed above \$100 from
February 2008 until early October, a span of eight months.

2008 seems a long way back, but **[the factors that drove oil to \$100
are in play today. A significant trigger of \$100 oil in late 2007 was
political unrest in several large oil-producing nations]{.underline}**,
in particular, Turkey and Nigeria. Then in June 2008, Israel threatened
to attack Iran over its nuclear development program. Iran had the fourth
largest oil reserve at that time.

The United States put sanctions on Iran last year for the same nuclear
issues that contributed to \$100 a barrel oil the last time crude topped
that mark. The U.S. sanctions have been extended to Venezuela because of
the activity of the dictator who rules that South American country,
which has the largest oil reserves. And in the past week, military and
political tensions in Libya have driven oil prices even higher.

Oil experts at international bank Barclays said they expect that oil
could top \$80 a barrel soon. Bank of America said the price may well
hit \$100 this year, driven by the problems in Iran and Venezuela.
Venezuela's oil output is only a third of what it was in 2015, and
financial and infrastructure problems continue to push that lower. The
International Energy Agency says U.S. sanctions have cut oil exports
from Iran by about half since the end of last year. The World Bank says
Nigeria's economy is faltering again.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continues
to be among the single greatest suppliers of oil in the world. It
announced last year that, led by Saudi Arabia, it would cut supplies
early in 2019. Most of the countries in the cartel have not only agreed
to the plans, but they have held production low for months. OPEC's
primary reason for the cut is that oil prices had come down far enough
to put a strain on the national treasuries of its members. OPEC crude
production was listed recently as a trigger to a drop in global
supplies.

Finally, **[another primary factor in large oil prices is military
unrest that could cause international conflict]{.underline}**. Tensions
with North Korea would certainly qualify. So would the battle among
China, the United States and Japan in parts of the East China Sea.

**[Many of the factors that drove oil above \$100 a barrel 11 years ago
are back in force again.]{.underline}**

**[With the world's second-largest reserves of oil, Saudi Arabia is also
the planet's leading producer, pumping out a staggering 10.2 million
barrels daily.]{.underline}** Originally, those massive energy reserves
were owned by a consortium of American companies operating under the
umbrella of the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco). In the 1970s,
however, Aramco was nationalized and is now owned by the Saudi
state---which is to say, the Saudi monarchy. Today, **[it is the world's
most valuable company, worth by some estimates as much as \$10 trillion
(10 times more than Apple), and so a source of almost unimaginable
wealth for the Saudi royal family.]{.underline}**

**[For decades, the country's leadership pursued a consistent
political-economic business plan: sell as much oil as possible and use
the proceeds to enrich the numerous princes and princesses of the realm;
provide lavish social benefits to the rest of the population, thereby
averting popular unrest of the "Arab Spring" variety; finance the
ultra-conservative Wahhabi clergy so as to ensure its loyalty to the
regime; finance like-minded states in the region; and put aside money
for those rainy-day periods of low oil prices.]{.underline}**

**[Saudi leaders have recently come to recognize that this plan is no
longer sustainable.]{.underline}** **[In 2016, the Saudi budget
has]{.underline}**, for the first time in recent memory, **[moved into
deficit territory and the monarchy has had to cut back on both its usual
subsidies to and social programs for its people]{.underline}**. Unlike
the Venezuelans or the Nigerians, **[the Saudi royals socked away enough
money in the country's sovereign wealth fund to cover deficit spending
for at least a couple of years.]{.underline}** **[It is
now]{.underline}**, however, **[burning through those funds at a
prodigious rate]{.underline}**, in part to finance a brutal and futile
war in Yemen. At some point, **[it will have to sharply curtail
government spending. Given the youthfulness of the Saudi population---70
percent of its citizens are under 30---and its long dependence on
government handouts, such moves could, in the view of many analysts,
lead to widespread civil unrest.]{.underline}**

Historically, **[Saudi leaders have been slow to initiate
change]{.underline}**. But recently, the royal family has defied
expectations, taking radical steps to prepare the country for a
transition to what's being termed a post-petroleum economy. On April
25th, the powerful Deputy Crown Prince, **[Mohammed bin Salman, unveiled
"Saudi Vision 2030,"]{.underline}** **[a somewhat hazy blueprint for the
kingdom's economic diversification and modernization.]{.underline}**
Prince Mohammed also indicated that the country will soon begin to offer
public shares in Saudi Aramco, with the intention of raising massive
funds to invest in and create non-oil-related Saudi industries and
revenue streams. On May 7th, the monarchy also abruptly dismissed its
long-serving oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, and replaced him with the head
of Saudi Aramco, Khalid al-Falih, a figure deemed more subservient to
Prince Mohammed. Falih's job title was also changed to minister of
energy, industry, and mineral resources, which was (so the experts
speculated) a signal from the monarchy of its determination to move
beyond exclusive reliance on oil as a source of income.

**[This is all so unprecedented that there is no way of predicting
whether the Saudi royals are actually capable of bringing anything like
Saudi Vision 2030 to fruition, no less moving away in a serious fashion
from its reliance on oil. Many obstacles remain, including the
possibility that jealous royals will push Prince Mohammed (and his
vision) aside when his father, King Salman, now 80, passes from the
scene. (There are regular rumors that some members of the royal family
resent the meteoric rise of the 31-year-old prince.) Nevertheless, his
dramatic statements about the need to diversify the kingdom's economy do
show that even Saudi Arabia---the petro-state par excellence---now
recognizes that some kind of new identity is now a
necessity.]{.underline}**

THE STAKES FOR US ALL

You may not live in a petro-state, but that doesn't mean you don't have
a stake in the evolution of this unique political life form. From at
least **[the "oil shock" of 1973, when the Arab OPEC members announced
an "oil boycott" against the United States for its involvement in the
Yom Kippur War, such countries have played an outsized role on the world
stage, distorting international relations, and---in the Greater Middle
East---involving themselves (and their financial resources) in one
conflict after another from the Iran-Iraq War of 1980--88 to the wars in
Yemen and Syria today.]{.underline}**

**[Their fervent support for and financing of favored
causes]{.underline}**---whether it be Wahhabism and associated jihadist
groups (Saudi Arabia), anti-Westernism (Russia), or the survival of the
Assad regime in Syria (Iran)---**[has provoked widespread disorder and
misery. It will hardly be a tragedy if a lack of funds forces such
states to pull back from efforts of this sort. But given the centrality
of fossil fuels to our world for the last century or more, the chaos
that could ensue in the oil heartlands of the planet from low oil prices
and high supply is likely to create unpredictable new nightmares of its
own.]{.underline}**

**[And the greatest nightmares of all lurk not in any of this but
in]{.underline}** **[the inability of these states and those they supply
to liberate themselves from reliance on fossil fuels fast
enough.]{.underline}** Looking into the future, the demise of
petro-states as we've known them could have a profound impact on the
struggle to avert catastrophic climate change. **[Although these states
are not primarily responsible for the actual combustion of fossil
fuels---that's something we in the oil-importing countries must take
responsibility for---their pivotal role in fueling the global petroleum
economy has made them largely resistant to international efforts to curb
emissions of carbon dioxide.]{.underline}** **[As they try to repair
their busted business model or collapse under the weight of its
failures, we can only hope that the path they follow will entail
significantly less dependence on oil exports as well as a determination
to speed up the conclusion of the fossil fuel era and so diminish its
legacy of climate disaster.]{.underline}**

### AT: Renewables Turn

#### Renewables are resilient to oil prices

**Faeq, former OPEC energy and oil marketing adviser, 19**

\[Faisal Faeq, 2-5-2019, \"Interaction between oil prices and
renewables,\" http://www.arabnews.com/node/1447166, accessed 6-27-2019,
//CM\]

Two nuclear disasters made structural changes in the renewable industry
and its associated technologies. The first disaster was the catastrophic
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, Ukraine in 1986.

Oil prices were at low levels at that time. While the accident didn't
stimulate investment in renewable or new projects, it did start changing
energy policies which helped to create interest in renewables over the
long term.

The second disaster was the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in
Japan. That took place at a time when oil prices were at record highs.
With renewables and their associated technologies already in limited
use, the accident resulted in strong enthusiasm for investment in
renewables worldwide, including major projects in both developed and
developing nations.

Renewable energy investments used to be dragged down by falling oil
prices. That is no longer the case. In fact, as oil prices tumble,
demand only keeps growing. There is a clear recognition that use of the
best form of energy and its associated technologies depends on more than
just price. Over the past three decades, renewable investments became
more resilient to movements in oil prices. Technologies are much more
advanced, and rely on plain market forces to find success. Unless they
collapse much further, low oil and gas prices are unlikely to delay or
kill renewable projects. Nowadays, solar power is competitive, even when
oil prices are in the doldrums.

In the early 1970s, the US worked actively with the renewable energy
industry to promote solar and wind power as alternatives to fossil
fuels. Low oil prices in the mid-1980s opened a period of reduced
involvement and unstable policies that almost killed renewable
investments and discouraged new renewable technologies. However, the
1986 Chernobyl accident paved the way for proactive policies, which for
more than two decades turned Europe into the biggest market for
renewable energy. The scenario was replicated recently by China, which
from 2011 to 2014, amid high oil prices, spent the biggest budget in
history on renewable technologies. Boom and bust cycles used to be the
hallmarks of the renewable energy industry. In the early 1980s, low oil
prices discouraged renewable energy investment in the US. The same thing
happened after oil prices slumped from \$147 to \$37 in 2008, dragging
down natural gas prices. On the other hand, record high oil prices from
2011 to 2014 intensified renewable energy projects.Low oil prices in the
early 1980s slashed gas prices in locations where oil indexation
remained strong and could favor coal-to-gas fuel switching within
existing generation fleets. In the US, the shale revolution more than
halved gas prices after 2008.

When oil prices plummeted in early 2016, which happened coincidentally
right after the Paris Climate Agreement took place in late 2015, many
analysts assumed that the impact of falling oil prices could end the
plans to cut emissions by de-carbonizing the energy sector. However, the
impact of falling oil prices on renewable energy investment varied
across the world.

Despite the IEA's outlook for renewable power generation to include up
to one third of the total global energy mix by 2023, there is still a
major role for crude. Oil means energy but turning to renewables doesn't
replace oil. This is because the historic correlation between crude oil
prices and the demand for renewable energy has been weakened in today's
global markets. Oil is primarily used for transport fuels,
petrochemicals and electricity generation. Renewables are primarily used
for electricity generation. Crude oil is a major commodity and a primary
raw material for industry. Renewables can't be either. This creates a
fundamental economic difference. Since oil and renewable are not
substitutes, when the price of one decreases, demand for the other does
not.

The International Energy Agency's 2015 Word Energy Outlook (WEO) drew
attention to the rise in renewable energy deployments. The report noted
that renewables contributed to almost half of the world's new power
generation capacity in 2014. Renewables have become the second-largest
source of electricity after coal. The WEO predicted that renewables,
concentrated strongly in the power sector, would become the leading
source of new energy supply to 2040, with deployments growing worldwide.

At the end of 2014, once that report was issued, crude oil prices
started a steep downward movement. This led to concern from the
International Energy Agency (IEA) about the deterioration in the value
of this essential commodity. The IEA warned that it would be a grave
mistake to index world attention to energy security to the price of oil.

The interaction between oil prices and renewables appears to be
weakening. This is mainly because energy investment is long-term and
requires new policies in developing nations. Gas prices seem to be more
linked but it can be seen that changes in the spot price of gas do not
in themselves derail investment in renewables. As long as renewables
keep getting cheaper, there is room for both. US sanctions will limit
oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar
to those imposed on Iran last year. Solar and wind are inherently
intermittent.

Therefore, a backup source of power that can be switched on and off at
will --- as coal, gas and nuclear can be --- is essential for industry.
Despite the fact that oil and gas prices are linked in most of the
world, cheap gas can complement renewables in a way that cheap oil
can't.

### AT: Phosphate

#### No impact -- we'll just recycle

**Urevig, Freelance Science writer, 16**

fertilize 100 percent of U.S. corn,\" Ensia,

accessed 7-3-2019, //CM\]

**[The world has a problem. A phosphorus problem.]{.underline}**

**[Needed to fertilize crops, the bulk of phosphorus comes from
nonrenewable phosphate rock. While China mines the most]{.underline}**
--- producing almost half the world's phosphorus --- **[Morocco alone
controls three-fourths of global phosphate rock reserves]{.underline}**.
Year by year those global reserves dwindle, leaving phosphate rock
that's ever lower in quality and ever harder to extract. At the same
time, as agriculture expands over the coming decades, experts project
increasing demand for mineral phosphorus.

**[Pair declining supply and rising demand with the lopsided geographic
distribution of phosphate, and it's not hard to see why experts think
prices are likely to go up, which could threaten global food
security.]{.underline}**

At the same time, **[excess phosphorus, including that running off
feedlots and released from wastewater treatment plants, threatens water
quality and ecosystem health as it fertilizes lakes, rivers and ocean
waters around the globe.]{.underline}**

**[A recent study]{.underline}** in Science of the Total Environment
**[examined one solution to these twin problems: recycling. Looking at
what recycled phosphorus could do for corn in the United States, the
country's number one crop, the study's authors found that we'd need just
37 percent of available recyclable domestic phosphorus to fertilize all
of the corn in the country.]{.underline}**

**[The researchers did the math for animal manure, human waste and
wasted food --- all of which contain phosphorus that traces back to
farmers' fertilizer --- and found that these three sources could furnish
more than 1.9 billion kilograms (4.2 billion pounds) of phosphorus each
year, with almost 90 percent from manure alone. That's more than enough
to sate American corn's 724 million kilogram (1.6 billion pound) annual
appetite for the element.]{.underline}**

Spatial analysis showed that **[we could meet three-fourths of demand
with phosphorus recycled in the county of origin]{.underline}**.
**[Additional phosphorus would have to travel an average of 302
kilometers (188 miles) to reach farms that need it, meaning that most
corn-producing states could fill demand within their borders. Currently
only 5 percent of U.S. cropland sees any manure fertilizer at
all.]{.underline}**

While the study's conclusions are surprising, the authors caution that
they don't intend to propose public policy. Instead, their paper is
meant as a "proof of concept" looking at the potential of recycling
phosphorus for U.S. corn. Regulatory, logistic and economic concerns
remain topics for future work to tackle.

For example, the fact that 25 percent of phosphorus for corn would have
to come from counties outside that in which the corn is grown underlines
the spatial disconnect between phosphorus sources and phosphorus demand
in the U.S. According to the researchers, that reality --- stemming from
the separation of farm animals and crops --- has intensified since the
1970s. Potential fixes, the researchers suggest, might involve
innovative technologies for better phosphorus recycling, which would let
farmers get more phosphorus from other sources nearby, making it less
necessary to look beyond county border. A more direct, though perhaps
more ambitious, solution might be sociopolitical efforts to bring
livestock and cropland closer together again. View Ensia homepage

## DA Turns Case

### **[Link Turns Case---Energy Security]{.underline}** 

#### **High oil prices threaten energy security through toxic corporate practices**

**Jobert, core member of Energy and Operations practices at The Boston
Consulting Group, et al 19** \[Frédérik Jobert, 3/19/19, BCG, "Why High
Oil Prices Can Be Bad for Energy Companies",
<https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/why-high-oil-prices-bad-for-energy-companies.aspx>,
accessed 6/30/19\]//CJ

Although oil prices continue to fluctuate, industry observers believe
that when the dust settles, the market will have recovered from the
stunning fall in prices from a peak of \$115 per barrel in June 2014 to
under \$35 less than two years later. At first blush, that would seem
like good news for the oil industry. But in fact, rising oil prices are
a mixed blessing. To be sure, they are good for profits and make
shareholders happy. **[At the same time, however, they correlate with
worsening outcomes for large capital expenditure projects---inevitably
forcing companies to earmark more money for oil recovery.]{.underline}**

Why the bad outcomes? To answer this, **[BCG examined the performance of
a sample group of upstream oil and gas capital projects during periods
of high and low oil prices. While we found that cost and scheduling
overruns were endemic at all times, project performance deteriorated
significantly in periods of higher oil prices]{.underline}**. On
average, during high price eras, capital projects exceeded original time
estimates by more than double and costs were 46% above anticipated
budgets. **[By contrast, during low price periods, scheduling and cost
overruns averaged out to 20% and 6%, respectively.]{.underline}** (See
Exhibit 1.) And while cost overruns may not be a perfect measure of
project performance (because they depend on how realistic the initial
budget estimate was), these problematic trends also show up in less
relative and more reliable gauges. For instance, capital intensity (the
amount spent to add a barrel of oil to a company's output) is 10%
greater when oil prices are climbing or at historical highs.

Of course, a simple explanation for this is that the number, complexity,
and average cost of projects undertaken during high and low price
periods are different enough to make up for the distinctions in overall
outcomes. For instance, when oil prices are lower, smaller and more
predictable projects---which are easier to manage and maintain cost
controls---are the norm. In addition, the organization is operating at a
relatively slower pace, making more talent available to monitor these
projects. Equally important, competition for contractors and equipment
is diminished, in turn reducing construction costs.

Yet we believe that these factors don't explain the differences
completely, nor do they provide a sufficiently meaningful rationale for
oil and gas companies to avoid the opposite: less attractive outcomes
when prices rise. **[Indeed, in our view the more useful answer is that
higher prices trigger toxic, undisciplined behaviors that are toned down
during tougher periods of low oil prices.]{.underline}**

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

The troublesome behaviors that emerge during high oil prices can be
broadly considered in the following manner:

1\. **[Overly Ambitious Targets.]{.underline}** The earlier the date of
first oil, the quicker the project can generate revenue. This presents a
huge incentive for management to demand unrealistic timelines for
projects---and for middle management to make top executives happy by
promising more oil more quickly than they can deliver. Complicating
this, the potential returns from a capital project based on net present
value are higher when the price of oil is elevated. By extension,
**[that means that there is an opportunity premium for accelerated
schedules---and yet another rationale for "window dressing" a project
with overly optimistic completion assumptions.]{.underline}**

Worse yet, this aggressive scheduling occurs more often than not in an
uncertain environment of bullish markets, more complex and bigger
projects, and fewer skilled managers, workers, and equipment---precisely
the conditions that should encourage oil companies to be more cautious.
Overall, inflated production forecasts compel project teams and
contractors to favor short cuts that are ultimately harmful to the
project during design and construction phases. (For more on this topic,
see "Why Schedules for Large Projects Shouldn't Include Dates," BCG
article, June 2016.)

2\. **[Fast-Tracked Front-End Engineering]{.underline}**. Often the
initial design phases of a capital project are truncated in response to
the aggressive schedules. **[Because the quality and depth of front-end
engineering design (FEED) directly affect project performance in the
construction phase, this can significantly determine whether the project
meets anticipated goals or falls flat]{.underline}**. Project managers
insist that a project's chances for success depend on analyzing and
fully understanding the location, size, rock formations, and unique
properties of the oil and gas reservoir to the extent possible before
the work begins.

The alternative, rushing through stage gates to meet ambitious
timelines, frequently handicaps construction field crews, leaving them
with less information to foresee potential problems and create
workarounds before they become worse than just nuisances. If navigating
challenges becomes a challenge in itself, the project's pace will slow
considerably. **[Viewed broadly, fast tracking can be an extremely
expensive mistake because in large capital projects, the cost of risk
rises over time as the project's complexity and moving parts
multiply.]{.underline}** Moreover, past the initial stages, the amount
of money tied up in a capital project increases rapidly while the
ability for a project owner to influence the activities of an array of
contractors in various phases of construction---**[and the ability to
mitigate risk---decreases. Diligence and discipline during front-end
engineering could at least serve as a bulwark against this future
risk.]{.underline}**

3\. Gold Plating Designs. When the **[FEED phase of a project is not
geared toward optimizing cost levels but rather is focused on quickly
starting construction, gathering sufficient information and making
educated, cost-effective decisions about the unique aspects of a project
site are often sacrificed]{.underline}**. Faced with this shortcoming,
it is not unusual for oil and gas teams to gold plate, or add redundant
structural elements, in order to plan for the unknown during the
construction phase. One former oil industry construction engineer
recalled a project that had built two foundations for a single oil rig
when one was obviously all that was needed. In other cases, extra
underground wells may be drilled---all in an attempt to make up for the
design work that was neglected initially.

Another cause of gold plating is the mushrooming of specifications and
standards for projects without justification or careful deliberation,
more as a generalized protection against risk than a targeted response
to a specific design or construction need. Instead of optimizing project
cost levels up front, oil and gas companies have leaned on brutally
competitive contractor bidding wars and lump sum contracts to minimize
expenses. A far more effective approach that would increase the odds of
a project's success would be, early on, to question the drivers of extra
cost, challenge specifications, eliminate gold plating, and find better
alternatives.

4**[. Owners Acting as Passive Monitors]{.underline}**. **[The issues
created by short-circuiting the initial aspects of the project are
carried over to the construction stage. In that phase, oil and gas
companies are prone to take hands-off stances]{.underline}**, assigning
the job to a contractor with a list of key performance indicators to
measure progress, but essentially hoping to outsource the risk. But in
reality, teamwork between project owners and contractors is imperative
because the contractor alone is not in a position to make design and
operational decisions that are dependent on the project owner's
expectations. Moreover, this collaboration brings the best possible
knowledge and resources to bear in addressing a problem or handling
on-the-ground challenges.

5\. **[Misaligned Contractor Payment Incentives]{.underline}**. The
situation is not helped by the lump sum agreements that are routinely
used to hire contractors for oil and gas projects. Instead of
facilitating risk anticipation and mitigation**[, these contracts create
perverse incentives for contractors to ignore potential problems or at
least avoid telling project owners about them]{.underline}**. Otherwise,
their margins may be affected by having to do more work or bring in
additional equipment and materials. In addition, contractors are
generally paid as large sections of the project are completed.
Consequently, it is to their advantage to undertake the big-ticket items
first, such as subsea pipelines that may account for a large portion of
the value of the contract, even though constructing such items too early
may lead to complications that set the project off course.

If evidence is needed for how **[these behaviors can be damaging to an
oil and gas company's performance, look no further than Kashagan Field,
a massive offshore oil field in Kazakhstan. Phase 1 began in 2000 with
ambitious expectations to produce first oil five years later. But a
combination of project management missteps stymied the effort almost
from the beginning.]{.underline}** According to project managers and
news reports, unrealistic timetables---which would have been challenging
to meet even in the unlikely event that the project suffered no
complications---led to inevitable fast tracking. As a result, design
decisions had to be made before the necessary study was completed, and
in the rush to hire contractors to minimize costs, companies were
brought onboard that were later shown to be inexperienced.

**[By the time Kashagan was finally producing oil, in late 2017, only
after the design was reconfigured numerous times and engineering,
procurement, and construction contracts were renegotiated, costs had
escalated some 85% to \$50 billion from \$27 billion.]{.underline}**
Project managers said that about \$5 billion of the cost overruns in
Kashagan was due to laying down the subsea pipeline too early in the
project's life cycle, in an effort to benefit from the contractual
enticement to wrap up big segments first. That was an expensive
decision, project managers said, because the pipeline corroded well
before the project's completion.

### Link Turns Case---Stability 

#### High oil prices lead to political instability---decreased access to food and government services

**Abrams, editor for Global Risk Insights, 13** \[Evan Abrams, 8/14/13,
Oilprice.com, "The Real Reason High Oil Prices Lead to Instability",
<https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-Real-Reason-High-Oil-Prices-Lead-to-Instability.html>,
accessed 6/30/19\]//CJ

Businesses rarely gain from political instability so trying to predict
unrest is a critical activity for any entity investing in a volatile
corner of the world. **[One of the factors most often cited as
contributing to unrest is high oil prices.]{.underline}**

Drawing a link between rising oil prices and political instability is
not particularly novel. Indeed, it has been pointed out by countless
observers who see **[anger with rising costs leading to political
activism]{.underline}**. They note that oil is linked to higher costs
across the board. The most direct interaction with oil for many people
is at a gas station. **[But oil prices affect the cost of nearly
everything else.]{.underline}**

For example**[, the price of diesel fuel for farming equipment alters
food prices. This was a major source of concern in Egypt during the
revolution, where food inflation has hit double digits multiple times in
the past several years.]{.underline}**

But if oil prices are really to blame for instability then Egypt also
offers a tricky puzzle. Oil prices peaked at \$140 per barrel in 2008,
before crashing during the Great Recession. They remained at less than
\$100 per barrel during the start of the revolution in January 2011.

The fact that the Arab Spring timeline does not match the rise and fall
of oil prices might cause some to discard petroleum as a critical factor
in the revolutions. However, that would be to miss the real political
cost of high oil prices.

**[High oil prices have a delayed political effect, particularly in
countries that heavily subsidize petroleum. If oil prices spike sharply
and governments are unwilling to reduce subsidies for fear of political
ramifications, it can lead to an increase in national debt and a
crowding out of public services as an increasing percent of public
resources are diverted to petroleum costs.]{.underline}**

Egyptian energy subsidies are estimated at \$16.8 billion and the
Petroleum Ministry is reported to lose roughly 66 percent on each barrel
of oil they produce. In more individual terms, Egyptians spend 18 cents
USD per liter for diesel fuel at pump stations, while Americans spend
over a dollar.

These subsidies were a critical factor in exploding Egypt's budget. At
the start of the revolution, Egyptian national debt was 73.2 percent of
GDP and the budget deficit stood at 8.1 percent of GDP. Given such
numbers, it is little wonder the government was unable to make
significant gains in healthcare, education or infrastructure.

Oil subsidies were not the only driver of this debt burden, but they
were a key contributor. **[This toxic combination of subsidies, rising
petroleum prices, and exploding debt is not unique to Egypt. Pakistan
and Venezuela are just two examples of other countries facing a similar
situation]{.underline}**.

The lesson here for companies seeking to avoid instability is twofold.
First, rising oil prices can have an indirect political impact through
increasing debt and crowding out other government services. Second, this
effect may be delayed and not fully felt until repayments become due in
later years.

### Link Turns Case---Conflict 

#### High oil prices makes conflict more likely

**Bunzel, worked in the political section of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
and in international economics at the U.S. Treasury, 18** \[Theodore
Bunzel, 5/30/18, The American Interest, "Do High Oil Prices Mean More
International Conflict?",
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/30/do-high-oil-prices-mean-more-international-conflict/>,
accessed 6/30/19\]//CJ

When asked in a recent interview about his famously sympathetic gaze
into Russian President Vladimir Putin's soul in 2001, former President
George W. Bush argued that rising oil prices had fundamentally changed
his interlocutor: "When I looked into his eyes and saw his soul, Russia
was broke . . . \[t\]he price of oil goes up and Putin changed."

Does the relationship between oil prices and Russian behavior to which
Bush alluded hold true? The higher the price of oil, the more aggressive
Russia becomes? And what about other petrostates? Might it be true for
those as well?

We may soon have more evidence for the proposition. Oil prices are
brushing off 2016 lows and hitting three-year highs. Brent crude has
been hovering above \$70 a barrel since April, up from lows of around
\$30 in early 2016, fueled by OPEC production cuts and rising
geopolitical tensions (over issues like the Iran deal). **[Though
nuances, complications, and exceptions abound, the academic and
historical evidence on balance tells us that, as we transition from a
lower to a higher oil price regime, we can generally expect a darker
geopolitical outlook. As rising oil revenues gives Russia, Saudi, Iran,
and other oil-exporters an added sense of confidence, it may at least
selectively inflame interstate tensions and lead to more aggressive
behavior.]{.underline}** That possibility, alongside an increasingly
hawkish U.S. national security team and a President who appears to feel
rather "unchained" of late, points to a potentially combustible mix just
ahead.

It is generally taken for granted that aspects of geopolitics can
function as a key input into oil prices. Trump's mere threat of a U.S.
strike in Syria, for example, caused oil to spike by 2 percent on April
11. In addition to short-term effects, geopolitical competition can
influence prices in other ways. To give just one general example, as
Soviet power spread into parts of the Third World after the independence
era, some states felt safer nationalizing their oil industries to escape
Western company control (Iraq in 1961, for example), and prices rose as
a consequence.

But **[the relationship may also work the other way around: Oil prices
can also be a key input into geopolitics. Many studies have demonstrated
that oil prices have a direct effect on the domestic stability of
petrostates. This makes ample intuitive sense: Higher prices fill public
coffers, allowing governments to palliate needy populations and
potential elite opposition groups by dispensing more largesse. Some
regime elites may reason that a firmer grip on power may free them to
carry out more assertive foreign policies without fear of being
undermined at home.]{.underline}**

There are, however, several complications to this general intuition.
Some states already have sufficiently buoyant revenues relative to their
small populations to satisfy their publics and feed clientelistic
networks. Providing largesse can also backfire if prices drop; taking
away something valuable that people have grown used to is a dangerous
game, especially when elites aren't ready to play it. And then of course
there is the famed "oil curse": For all sorts of reasons, from "Dutch
disease" economic distortions to the derangement of normal citizen-state
relationships, oil riches can in time undermine regimes, weakening and
even destroying them.

**[That said, a more recent body of research has empirically
demonstrated the intuitive twin of this conclusion: Higher prices cause
greater interstate aggression by oil-producing countries]{.underline}**.
Why would this be the case? **[Greater oil revenue flushes petrostates
with confidence and also cash that they can put toward military spending
or foreign adventures]{.underline}**. To take one obvious example, **[we
need only look to Iran's using its oil revenue to fund proxy groups such
as Hamas and Hezbollah. Furthermore, military spending by one regional
oil producer can beget spending by others, fueling regional arms races
that can make aggression and conflict by miscalculation more
likely.]{.underline}** The onset of the Iran-Iraq War in September 1980
may be a prime example of that dynamic.

Most prominent among the empirical studies is Cullen S. Hendrix's
**[2014 paper, which shows a statistically significant relationship
between higher oil prices and "dispute behavior"]{.underline}**
(military actions short of actual war) by oil-exporters. (Hendrix also
summed it up nicely in this Washington Post piece.) He found that "all
things being equal, **[a one standard deviation (\$18.60) increase in
the price per barrel of oil from the sample mean (\$33.81) is associated
with a 13 percent increase in the frequency of \[dispute
behavior\]]{.underline}**" in oil-exporting states. He also found that,
above \$77 a barrel, oil-exporters are significantly more dispute prone
than non-oil exporters.

Hendrix also explores the potential complication of reverse causality:
Could dispute behavior by oil-exporting countries be driving prices
higher, rather than the other way around? A key analytical consideration
here is timing. We can all agree that geopolitical activity affects
prices in the short-term (such as the Syria example mentioned above),
but is this reverse causality true on a sustained basis? **[Parsing out
long-term signal from short-term noise, Hendrix examines whether
elevated aggregate dispute behavior affects oil prices at the
yearly---rather than daily or weekly---level, and finds that this
relationship does not hold]{.underline}**. His explanation here is that
other players typically step in to redress markets: "While dispute
behavior may drive prices changes in the short term . . . the strategic
significance of oil prices and oil-exporting states encourages major
powers to act in ways that stabilize markets, either through market
intervention . . . or direct, armed intervention."

Jeff Colgan of Brown University has also touched on this topic,
**[finding through his research that oil has fueled---in some way---one
quarter to one half of interstate wars since 1973.]{.underline}** He
also notes that oil-producers are 50 percent more likely to engage in
conflict than non-oil producers**[. Colgan identifies eight,
non-mutually exclusive causal mechanisms for how oil fuels international
conflict, most of which are implicitly exacerbated by higher prices.
They are: "(1) resource wars, in which states try to acquire oil
reserves by force; (2) petro-aggression, whereby oil insulates
aggressive leaders such as Saddam Hussein or Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
from domestic opposition and therefore makes them more willing to engage
in risky foreign policy adventurism; (3) the externalization of civil
wars in oil-producing states ("petrostates"); (4) financing for
insurgencies---for instance, Iran funneling oil money to Hezbollah; (5)
conflicts triggered by the prospect of oil-market domination, such as
the U.S. war with Iraq over Kuwait in 1991; (6) clashes over control of
oil transit routes, such as shipping lanes and pipelines; (7)
oil-related grievances, whereby the presence of foreign workers in
petrostates helps extremist groups such as al-Qaeda recruit locals; and
(8) oil-related obstacles to multilateral cooperation, such as when an
importer's attempt to curry favor with a petrostate prevents
multilateral cooperation on security issues."]{.underline}**

### Non-UQ -- Saudi Cutting Supply

#### Saudi Arabia is already cutting supplies to boost prices

**Gloystein, energy analyst for Reuters, 19** \[Henning Gloystein,

**[Oil prices rose on Monday after Saudi Arabia said producer club OPEC
and Russia were likely to keep withholding supplies,]{.underline}** and
in relief as the United States withdrew its threat to impose import
tariffs on Mexico, removing one cloud over the global economy.

Front-month Brent crude futures, **[the international benchmark for oil
prices, were at \$63.52 at 0310 GMT, 23 cents, or 0.4%, above Friday's
close]{.underline}**.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at \$54.29 per
barrel, 30 cents, or 0.6%, above their last settlement.

Traders said crude prices were rising because of statements by **[OPEC's
de-facto leader Saudi Arabia on Friday saying that the group was close
to agreeing extended supply cuts.]{.underline}**

"Brent futures continue rising \... after the Saudi Arabian Energy
Minister expressed confidence that OPEC+ producers will prolong their
output cuts programme through the second half of 2019," said Han Tan,
analyst at futures brokerage FXTM.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some
non-members, including Russia, known collectively as "**[OPEC+", have
withheld supplies since the start of the year to prop up
prices.]{.underline}**

Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets, said stronger stock
markets also supported oil futures.

"With the Mexican stalemate averted and no harmful shockwaves from this
weekend G-20 meeting \... oil could trade favourably as WTI and Brent
will continue to track the broader risk environment high," Innes said.

Stock markets rose on Monday after a deal between the United States and
Mexico to combat illegal migration from Central America late last week
removed the threat of U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Mexico.

But analysts said there were still concerns about the health of the
global economy, with the United States and China still locked in a trade
war.

"**[Slowing global demand appears to be featuring prominently on the
markets collective mind, as the fallout from heightened trade tensions
continues to be felt in the global economy]{.underline}**," said FXTM's
Tan.

"**[The sustainability of oil's recent climb could be determined by the
outlooks of several key industry bodies scheduled this
week]{.underline}**, whereby more downcast projections for global demand
could prompt traders to continue chipping away at oil," he added.

Oil major BP is to publish its statistical review of global energy
markets on Tuesday, while China on Friday is scheduled to publish its
monthly commodities output data.

#### **Saudi Arabia is withholding oil until it reaches \$70+ a barrel**

**Gamal et al, oil analysts for Reuter, 19** \[Rania El Gamal, 3/22/19,

**[Budget needs are forcing Saudi Arabia to push for oil prices of at
least \$70 per barrel this year, industry sources say,]{.underline}**
even though U.S. shale oil producers could benefit and Riyadh's share of
global crude markets might be further eroded.

Riyadh, OPEC's de facto leader, said it was **[steeply cutting exports
to its main customers in March and April despite refiners asking for
more of its oil]{.underline}**. The move defies U.S. President Donald
Trump's demands for OPEC to help reduce prices while he toughens
sanctions on oil producers Iran and Venezuela.

The export cuts are designed to prop up prices, sources close to Saudi
oil policy say. Saudi officials say the kingdom's output policies are
merely intended to balance the world market and reduce high inventories.

"The Saudis want oil at \$70 at least and are not worried about too much
shale oil," said one industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy.

Another source said Saudi Arabia wanted to "put a floor under oil
prices" at \$70 or slightly lower, and added: "No one at OPEC can talk
about output increases now."

Officially, Saudi Arabia, which plans to raise government spending to
boost economic growth, does not have a price target. It says price
levels are determined by the market and that it is merely targeting a
balance of global supply and demand.

**[Even a price of around \$70 a barrel would not balance Saudi Arabia's
books this year, according to figures cited by Jihad Azour, director of

\$80-\$85 a barrel.]{.underline}**

Weaken the Dollar. Powell Says That's Not His Job",

**[President Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar to help boost exports,
and is counting on the Federal Reserve to help make that
happen]{.underline}**. But the central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell,
has made clear it's not his job.

It's a new twist in the broader pressure campaign the president has
brought to bear on Powell to cut interest rates to energize the stock
market and fuel growth.

**[Trump's focus on the dollar surfaced last week after the European
Central Bank said it might ease policy, prompting the euro to drop
against the dollar. Trump seized on the move to say on June 18 that the
Fed's failure to lower rates was putting U.S. exporters at a competitive
disadvantage]{.underline}**. He later mused on June 26 he'd rather have
ECB President Mario Draghi running the Fed.

Powell, once again, is finding himself on the defensive, trying to
shield the Fed from political influence. He deflected Trump's calls back
at the administration.

"The Treasury Department \-- the administration \-- is responsible for
exchange rate policy \-- full stop," Powell said June 25 in response to
a question from the audience after a speech in New York. "We don't
comment on the level of the dollar. We certainly don't target the level
of the dollar. We target domestic economic and financial conditions as
other central banks do."

**[Trump has explored options for removing or demoting Powell over the
Fed's interest rate decisions, which the president says have hampered
growth. And the currency comments offer yet another point of tension
between the world's most powerful leader and its most influential
central banker.]{.underline}**

Last week, **[Trump accused both Europe and China of weakening their
currencies to gain a competitive advantage]{.underline}**. Some Wall
Street banks are questioning whether the U.S. might intervene in
currency markets.

"Make no mistake about it, what Draghi and other central banks are doing
is the same as what China is doing \-- weakening their currencies," said
Dan DiMicco, who was an adviser to Trump's campaign and presidential
transition and now sits on an administration trade advisory committee.

Trade-weighted index approaches all-time high

The Trump administration has from the start deviated from a 20-year-old
policy that a strong dollar was in the nation's best interest. Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in 2017 that an "excessively strong
dollar" could have negative effects on the American economy, and Trump
has made similar comments since taking office.

"The repeated, intense comments by the president lead me to believe that
we're no longer pursuing a strong dollar policy," said Nathan Sheets,
chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income and a former Treasury official
from the Obama administration. "This is a distinct, new chapter in U.S.
currency management and strategy.

The strong-dollar mantra was developed by then-Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin in 1995. Underpinning it is the view that a robust currency
reflects a healthy economy and bolsters foreign demand for U.S. debt by
reducing the prospect of currency losses. While a stronger dollar helps
American consumers by lowering the cost of imports, it also compounds
manufacturers' struggles by making exports less competitive.

**[Trump has an unlikely supporter in wanting a weaker dollar: Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who's running for
president. She proposes "actively managing" the dollar to counter
foreign investors and central banks' moves.]{.underline}**

Trump and Warren's ideas "very much could trigger a currency war," said
Fred Bergsten, an economist and author of "The Dollar's Dilemma."

**[But those who advocate that a weaker dollar is better for the U.S.
say that former President Ronald Reagan's administration was able to do
it in the 1980s without destroying faith in the
greenback.]{.underline}**

## Internal Link

### No Internal Link - \$100 Oil Doesn't Matter

#### \$100 oil is overrated 

**Cunningham, freelance oil and gas writer, 18**

\[Nick Cunningham, 5-15-2018, \"Will \$100 Oil Kill The U.S. Economy?,\"
OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Will-100-Oil-Kill-The-US-Economy.html,
accessed 6-28-2019, //CM\]

Brent is nearing \$80 per barrel and some analyst see \$100 not far off.
That raises the question about how much of a dent high oil prices will
make in the U.S. economy.

\$100 oil is not as painful as it once was. There are a few reasons for
that. **[The U.S. is now a significant oil exporter, helping to lessen
the damage to its trade balance. Also, the economy uses less energy per
unit of GDP than it used to, becoming slightly more efficient with each
passing year.]{.underline}**

In the past, high oil prices dragged down the U.S. economy, acting as a
tax that redistributed wealth from the U.S. to oil-exporting countries
in the Middle East, for example. But, **[the shale revolution has
allowed the U.S. to become one of the largest oil producers in the
world, and more recently, an exporter of more than 2 million barrels per
day]{.underline}** (depending on the week). Now, to a large extent,
**[higher oil prices redistribute wealth within the U.S., still damaging
the vast majority of motorists, but benefitting a variety of industries
related to the oil industry.]{.underline}**

That has narrowed the impact on the country's trade deficit. For
example, in 2005, when oil prices bounced around in the \$60s per
barrel, the U.S. petroleum trade deficit hit \$230 billion. In 2017,
when WTI was in a similar price range, the U.S. petroleum trade deficit
was just \$62 billion.

According to Bloomberg Economics, **[\$100 oil would knock off 0.4
percent from U.S. GDP in 2020 compared to if oil traded at just \$75 --
not trivial by any means, but not devastating either.]{.underline}**
"The price of a barrel will have to go much higher before global growth
slips on an oil slick," economists Jamie Murray, Ziad Daoud, Carl
Riccadonna and Tom Orlik said.

**[A survey of economists by CNBC found a mixed picture with some
responding that higher oil prices are largely "a wash" for U.S. economic
growth. It is a notable shift in tone and substance from the past, when
higher oil prices as an economic headwind was taken as a
given]{.underline}**. \"We think the effect will round to a wash,\'\'
Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist with J.P. Morgan Chase, told CNBC.
He noted that higher oil prices would reduce GDP by 0.2 percent, but
that would be offset by an increase of 0.2 percent in capital spending.

That conclusion was echoed by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James
Bullard who agreed that **[higher oil prices spark more activity in the
energy sector, offsetting some of the losses elsewhere. \"This will also
encourage U.S. production, and compared to years past, oil prices have a
more neutral effect on the U.S. economy,\'\' Bullard said. \"It used to
be a big oil shock was probably bad news, ... but now I think it\'s
neutral.\"]{.underline}**

Still, the marginal impact is only true up to a certain point. Drivers
can stomach \$3-per-gallon gasoline, but \$4 per gallon is another
matter. Also, the benefits accruing to the energy sector and related
industries are concentrated, while the economic drag on consumers is
widespread. If retail gasoline prices average \$2.96 per gallon this
year, it will wipe out a third of additional take home pay from the 2017
tax cuts, according to Morgan Stanley.

### No Internal Link -- Saudi Arabia Can't Spike

#### There are a litany of reasons why Saudi can't increase oil prices

**Kemp, market analyst for Reuters, 18** \[John Kemp, 10/16/18,
Financial Post, "The real reason we have nothing to fear from Saudi
Arabia's 'oil weapon'",
<https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/column-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-kemp>,
accessed 6/28/19\]//CJ

Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ its so-called "oil weapon" in the
diplomatic crisis over the disappearance of a journalist after visiting
the country's consulate in Istanbul.

**[Experience from the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as
a diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and
the kingdom itself would be the biggest victim.]{.underline}**

**[Despite some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media,
self-interest makes it improbable the government will
retaliate]{.underline}** by reducing oil sales or trying to drive up
prices.

That has not stopped some veiled threats to weaponize oil production and
prices, but they should be interpreted as an urgent plea for support and
understanding rather than a serious threat.

"If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an
economic disaster that would rock the entire world," according to

one heated editorial.

"Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would affect
oil production before any other vital commodity," the editorial warned.

If the price of oil reaching US\$80 a barrel angered U.S. President
Donald Trump, "no one should rule out the price jumping to US\$100, or
US\$200, or even double that figure," the author said bluntly.

The government's official response has been more circumspect but it
nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater
retaliation and pointed to the kingdom's "influential and vital role in
the global economy."

OIL EMBARGO

**[In October 1973, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers
announced that they would start cutting production by 5 per cent per
month until Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab
territories.]{.underline}**

In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an
embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of other
countries.

Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the decisions
to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of
low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s.

Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as much
as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March 1972.

In this context, the production cuts and embargo made an already tight
market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge, short-term
revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.

But **[the policy was a failure in its own terms, was reversed a few
months later, and caused immense long-term damage to Saudi Arabia and
OPEC that took decades to reverse.]{.underline}**

POLICY FAILURE

At the most basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated
objective of changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to
withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories.

More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, the surge
in prices, which rose again after the Iranian revolution in 1979,
resulted in **[permanent demand destruction and encouragement of
alternative suppliers.]{.underline}**

Rising prices **[helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska,
the North Sea, the Soviet Union and China]{.underline}**, which came
onstream and flooded the oil market in the 1980s.

Rising prices also encouraged a **[wholesale switch away from the use of
crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and commercial heating
boilers as well as in power generation]{.underline}**.

**[Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced
economies switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable
heating using natural gas or electricity generated from coal or
nuclear.]{.underline}**

Crude oil and fuel oil **[were replaced by a new generation of
coal-fired power plants in the United States in the late 1970s and the
1980s]{.underline}** (ironically the same coal plants that are now being
closed and replaced by natural gas).

**[The oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation
of nuclear power plants]{.underline}** in the United States, France,
Japan, Britain and other countries to reduce the reliance on imported
crude.

Cheap oil had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power
generation in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under
pressure.

By the late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been
largely pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal,
gas and nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never
recovered.

Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new
fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports
for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of demand.

In the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil
price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and
1990s, and from which they did not recover until the 2000s.

WEAPON MALFUNCTION

**[The oil weapon does not work, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely
to employ it]{.underline}** in the dispute over the disappearance of
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

In the short term, Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in
prices than it lost from a reduction in sales. But rising prices would
hit the global economy and consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil
market slump within a year.

**[The weapon cannot be wielded in a targeted way against specific
consuming countries because the oil market is global and fully
integrated. Restricting supplies to punish some countries pushes up oil
prices for all consumers.]{.underline}**

Wielding the oil weapon to pressure the United States would impose
bigger costs on China and India, which are the largest and
fastest-growing oil importers and crucial markets for the future.

**[Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a reliable oil
supplier, especially to customers in Asia, and any attempt to employ the
oil weapon would destroy that carefully crafted
reputation.]{.underline}**

**[Saudi Arabia's refining customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia
and the United States for additional supplies and likely reconsider
their long-term dependence on the kingdom]{.underline}**.

If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponize oil production and
sales, **[the resulting surge in prices would prompt another round of
conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main
product.]{.underline}**

Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle fuel
economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of electric
vehicles.

Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies would speed the
diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the transport market
just as it was pushed out of heating and power generation in the 1980s.

Saudi Arabia has spent years urging oil-consuming countries to remember
it needs "security of demand" just as much as they need "security of
supply".

But weaponizing oil production would break that understanding and
provoke a backlash from consuming countries with a concerted effort to
reduce their oil imports.

Finally, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for security
(including the provision of advanced weapons systems, training,
intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and aircraft stationed in
and around the Gulf).

There is no way to wield the oil weapon which would not shake the
foundations of the U.S.-Saudi alliance on which the kingdom's defence
depends, leaving it vulnerable to regional rivals, including Iran.

For all these reasons, the oil weapon is essentially useless, an
unreliable blunderbuss more likely to blow up the user than its intended
target, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to deploy it.

#### No internal link -- Saudi Arabia doesn't have the influence

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/01/pulling-back-mask-saudi-oil-power/579661/,
accessed 6-26-2019, //CM\]

What do Presidents Donald **[Trump and]{.underline}** Jimmy
**[Carter]{.underline}** have in common? **[Both opted to lay into opec,
the toothless global energy cartel, rather than blame Saudi Arabia,
historically the world's top oil exporter, for the price of oil. But as
opec's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia usually lies behind any
production decisions the group makes.]{.underline}**

In the early 1980s, The Atlantic sent the reporter Edward Jay Epstein to
opec's Vienna headquarters. He came back with a scathing story. The
scars of the 1970s oil wars were still fresh. **[In 1973, Saudi Arabia
had joined other Arab states in embargoing oil sales to the United
States. In 1979, the Iranian revolution disrupted oil production,
causing the lines for gas that marked Carter's
presidency]{.underline}**. But, Epstein concluded, **[opec was never the
real threat]{.underline}**. **[It wasn't even a proper cartel, since it
lacked the power to restrict oil supplies.]{.underline}** Its primary
purpose was to distract attention from the decision makers. "Even though
Saudi Arabia was the real manager of the world oil supply, statesmen
around the world preferred to blame an almost nonexistent
organization---opec," Epstein wrote.

**[In the years since, the United States has become an energy
titan]{.underline}**. In November, for the first time in decades, **[the
United States briefly exported more oil than it imported.]{.underline}**
But a historian who read Epstein's story in 2019 said some of it felt
like it could have been written yesterday. Ellen Wald, the author of
Saudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom\'s Pursuit of Profit and Power and the
president of Transversal Consulting, found important contrasts when
comparing the snapshots represented in Epstein's 1983 article with
today's energy story.

**[1. Saudi Arabia's oil power stems from one factor:
control.]{.underline}** **[When ministers from the countries that make
up opec gather, Saudi Arabia is first among equals]{.underline}**.
"Production decisions are made in Riyadh, not Vienna," Saudi Arabia's
then--oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said in the 1980s. Saudi Aramco,
the national oil company owned by the royal family, can today, in
principle, pump up to 12 million barrels of oil a day. What has always
given the Saudis their power is the ability to produce less if they want
to drive up prices.

What may not have been clear in the 1980s, according to Wald, was that
**[the Saudis didn't always have this control. Aramco was originally an
American creation]{.underline}**, and it was **[historically owned by
four Western oil companies]{.underline}**. **[The Saudis slowly bought
them out, but at the time of the embargo, the Saudis owned only 25
percen]{.underline}**t of the company. In an episode Wald researched for
her book, Yamani had to go to Aramco's American CEO to tell him to
implement the embargo. Wald paraphrased their conversation for me: "The
CEO said to him \[that\] he didn\'t think they\'d be able to do this
embargo and these production cuts. And Yamani, the Saudi oil minister,
responded, 'Oh yes. We\'ve discussed that. We\'ll be able to do it
because you are going to do it.' And that was that." The American fell
into line.

Now the Saudis fully own Aramco and no longer need to ask permission to
change production. "They have this one room where they can literally
control any of the oil taps and all of the refineries. They know where
all of their ships are, and every barrel of oil being produced," Wald
said. "With the flick of a switch they can turn their oil production
down." Compare that with the United States, where oil is produced by
dozens of independent companies. Antitrust laws prohibit opec-style
coordination with other producers.

**[2. opec is still toothless]{.underline}**, but it remains a
convenient enemy. **[If production decisions are made in Riyadh, what's
the point of a Vienna-based faux oil cartel?]{.underline}** "Every time
everyone gets together for an opec meeting, that\'s the No. 1 question,"
Wald said. History provides some insight. As Carter was struggling with
a response to the oil shock, which was caused in part by Saudi
maneuvering, an adviser turned to him with a proposal. "With strong
steps we can mobilize the nation around a real crisis and with a clear
enemy---opec," a memo suggested. "**[opec made an especially convenient
'clear enemy' precisely because it hardly existed]{.underline}**,"
Epstein wrote. "If a real country were chosen for this role, there would
be real consequences." opec's existence gave plausible deniability not
just to its members but also to its adversaries, including the United
States.

**[opec serves the same cynical function today]{.underline}**. "I don\'t
see that changing, because it plays a vital role as this great villain
in Americans' minds. We can blame opec when oil prices are too high. But
particular oil producers, we can still be friends with them," Wald said.
Trump has followed the pattern of giving Saudis the credit and OPEC the
blame. "Oil prices getting lower ... Thank you to Saudi Arabia," he
tweeted in November. The next month, the tweet was: "Hopefully opec will
be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted."

**[3. The Saudis can't quit America either.]{.underline}** After the
murder of the writer Jamal Khashoggi, allies of Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman warned that the **[Saudis could retaliate to]{.underline}**
any American **[sanctions. Saudi officials denounced that option though,
saying there would be no return to the embargo era]{.underline}**. They
have good reasons for that. **[The 10 million--plus barrels of oil the
Saudis pump every day are far more than the record low of roughly 2
million barrels a day the kingdom produced in the mid-1980s, when it was
trying to make prices spike.]{.underline}** And **[the kingdom needs
American customers to buy that oil in order to fund its economic
diversification strategy, known as Vision 2030.]{.underline}** **[Its
political relationship with Washington also constrains its ability to
cut production; after Trump announced new sanctions on Iranian oil in
fall 2018, the Saudi crown prince promised to pump more to keep the
market balanced. However, Saudi Arabia is cutting production again after
the United States issued waivers to its Iranian sanctions
policy.]{.underline}**

**[The Saudis have been able to use their oil weapon only when other oil
producers are tapped out,]{.underline}** Wald said. **[With the American
energy sector booming, global markets look very different from the '70s
and '80s.]{.underline}** The Saudi business model has also changed.
**[Saudi Aramco is no longer "just drilling holes in the ground and
pumping out," Wald said. In 2017, the company took over the largest oil
refinery in the United States. "The Saudis would essentially be
embargoing their own refinery,"]{.underline}** Wald said. That makes the
overall relationship safer.

"The genius maybe of the early Saudi kings was that they let the oil
business be the oil business. **[They recognized how important the money
that the oil business generated was to their own power,"]{.underline}**
Wald said. Unlike countries that quickly nationalized their oil
companies, such as Iran or Venezuela**[, the Saudis transitioned to
national control of their oil resources over many years, without
throwing out the American expertise that made Aramco so profitable to
its owners. Wald is less confident that the current generation of Saudi
leaders will display the same cautious strategy about their
assets.]{.underline}** A plan to sell public shares of Aramco, billed as
a move to make the secretive company more transparent, was shelved last
year. "There isn\'t the same sense of patience that some of the older
Saudi kings, the original king and some of his sons, had about this,"
Wald said. Rather than opening up, the Saudis have opted, again, for
control.

### No Internal Link -- Saudi Arabia Won't Spike

#### Saudi Arabia can't and won't ruin the oil market

**Paraskova, editor for Oilprice, 4/23** \[Tsvetana Paraskova, 4/23/19,
Mining.com, "Can Saudi Arabia still sway the oil market?",
<https://www.mining.com/web/can-saudi-arabia-still-sway-oil-market/>,
accessed 6/28/19\]//CJ

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and OPEC's largest producer,
has influenced the oil market and oil flows since the middle of the 20th
century.

Shortly after the 21st century began, one of Saudi Arabia's key
customers made its first steps toward becoming one of the Kingdom's main
competitors on the global oil market: the United States began fracking
for oil in the mid-2000s. **[By the end of the 2010s, the U.S. is now
the world's biggest crude oil producer, having surpassed Russia and
Saudi Arabia to claim the crown.]{.underline}**

Sure, Saudi Arabia is one of the most important factors in global crude
trade and oil market participants are lapping up every word and hint
from the top oil officials in the Kingdom.

But as **[the U.S. has started to rely on fewer imported barrels, Saudi
Arabia's power to sway the market has diminished. Another large Saudi
customer, China, now has more leverage over Saudi Arabia's oil
flows]{.underline}**, Dafna Maor, a columnist for Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, writes.

U.S. crude oil imports from all over the world have declined from their
peak of 10.126 million bpd in 2005, while imports from Saudi Arabia have
also been down in recent years, to average below 1 million bpd in 2017,
for the first time since 2009, according to the latest EIA data.
Meanwhile, U.S. production is breaking records, despite a slowdown in
shale growth in recent months as a result of the 40-percent oil price
slump in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In recent years, the Saudis have had stiff competition in what is now
the world's largest oil importing nation, China. In the past three
years, **[Saudi Arabia has lost its status of China's number-one
supplier---to none other than its ally in the OPEC/non-OPEC production
cut deal, Russia.]{.underline}**

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, but **[its dominance
over the global oil market has started to crack in recent years. Now the
Kingdom influences the market and oil prices as much as (or probably
less than) the Permian basin in West Texas does]{.underline}**,
Haaretz's Maor argues.

**[The Saudis don't want to lose control over OPEC's oil production
policies, which the cartel publicly says are always aimed at a "balanced
oil market", while many OPEC members, including the de facto leader
Saudi Arabia, actually need oil prices at least as high as their
budget-balance needs. In Saudi Arabia's case, this is around \$80 a
barrel Brent Crude or slightly higher.]{.underline}**

At the same time, **[Saudi Arabia claims it wants to diversify its
economy away from over-reliance on oil.]{.underline}**

As per OPEC figures, the oil and gas sector generates around 50 percent
of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product (GDP), and accounts for some 70
percent of its export earnings.

The so-called Vision 2030 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has grand
plans about billions upon billions of U.S. dollars in investments into
the Saudi economy and renewable energy. Ironically, the Kingdom relies
on proceeds from oil, including from the much-hyped but still-on-hold
listing of 5 percent in its oil giant Aramco, to fund the
transformation.

Yet, until this transformation begins to take place, if at all, Saudi
Arabia is aggressively pursuing long-term downstream deals in the
world's fastest-growing oil demand center, Asia, with the goal to lock
in future demand for its crude oil.

Aramco has signed in recent months a number of agreements in China to
take part in refinery projects. One of the latest deals, buying a
9-percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical's 800,000-bpd integrated
refinery and petrochemical complex in Zhoushan, says that "Saudi
Aramco's involvement in the project will come with a long-term crude
supply agreement and the ability to utilize Zhejiang Petrochemical's
large crude oil storage facility to serve its customers in the Asian
region."

Despite plans to transform its economy from over-reliance on crude oil
and despite gradually losing its dominant position as the single biggest
oil price mover**[, Saudi Arabia is not willing to give up its
geopolitical and market power that comes with its current status of the
world's largest oil exporter.]{.underline}**

itself would be the biggest victim.]{.underline}**

Despite some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media,
**[self-interest makes it improbable the government will retaliate by
reducing oil sales or trying to drive up prices.]{.underline}**

**[That has not stopped some veiled threats]{.underline}** to weaponise
oil production and prices, but they should be interpreted as an urgent
plea for support and understanding rather than a serious threat.

"If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an
economic disaster that would rock the entire world," according to one
heated editorial ("U.S. sanctions would mean Washington is stabbing
itself", Al Arabiya, Oct. 14).

"**[Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would affect
oil production before any other vital commodity]{.underline}**," the
editorial warned.

If the price of oil reaching \$80 a barrel angered U.S. President Donald
Trump, "no one should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or \$200, or
even double that figure", the author said bluntly.

The government's official response has been more circumspect but it
nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater
retaliation and pointed to the kingdom's "influential and vital role in
the global economy". OIL EMBARGO

In October 1973, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers announced
that they would start cutting production by 5 percent per month until
Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab territories.

In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an
embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of other
countries ("OPEC: 25 years of prices and politics", Skeet, 1988).

**[Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the
decisions to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a
result of low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s.]{.underline}**

**[Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as
much as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March
1972.]{.underline}**

In this context, the **[production cuts and embargo made an already
tight market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge,
short-term revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil
producers.]{.underline}**

But the policy was a failure in its own terms, was reversed a few months
later, and caused immense long-term damage to Saudi Arabia and OPEC that
took decades to reverse.

POLICY FAILURE

At the most basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated
objective of changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to
withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories.

More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, the
**[surge in prices]{.underline}**, which rose again after the Iranian
revolution in 1979, **[resulted in permanent demand destruction and
encouragement of alternative suppliers.]{.underline}**

**[Rising prices helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska,
the North Sea, the Soviet Union and China, which came onstream and
flooded the oil market in the 1980s.]{.underline}**

**[Rising prices also encouraged a wholesale switch away from the use of
crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and commercial heating
boilers as well as in power generation.]{.underline}**

**[Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced
economies switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable
heating using natural gas or electricity generated from coal or
nuclear.]{.underline}**

**[Crude oil and fuel oil were replaced by a new generation of
coal-fired power plants in the United States in the late 1970s and the
1980s]{.underline}** (ironically the same coal plants that are now being
closed and replaced by natural gas).

The **[oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation
of nuclear power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain and
other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude.]{.underline}**

Cheap oil had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power
generation in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under
pressure.

By the late 1980s, however, **[expensive and unreliable oil had been
largely pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal,
gas and nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never
recovered.]{.underline}**

**[Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new
fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports
for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of
demand]{.underline}**.

In the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil
price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and
1990s, and from which they did not recover until the 2000s.

WEAPON MALFUNCTION

**[The oil weapon does not work, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely
to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of Washington Post
journalist Jamal Khashoggi.]{.underline}**

In the short term, **[Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise
in prices than it lost from a reduction in sales. But rising prices
would hit the global economy and consumption hard and threaten a renewed
oil market slump within a year.]{.underline}**

**[The weapon cannot be wielded in a targeted way against specific
consuming countries because the oil market is global and fully
integrated. Restricting supplies to punish some countries pushes up oil
prices for all consumers.]{.underline}**

**[Wielding the oil weapon to pressure the United States would impose
bigger costs on China and India, which are the largest and
fastest-growing oil importers and crucial markets for the
future]{.underline}**.

**[Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a reliable oil
supplier, especially to customers in Asia, and any attempt to employ the
oil weapon would destroy that carefully crafted
reputation.]{.underline}**

**[Saudi Arabia's refining customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia
and the United States for additional supplies and likely reconsider
their long-term dependence on the kingdom.]{.underline}**

**[If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponise oil production and
sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another round of
conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main
product.]{.underline}**

Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle fuel
economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of electric
vehicles.

**[Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies would speed the
diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the transport market
just as it was pushed out of heating and power generation in the
1980s.]{.underline}**

Saudi Arabia has spent years urging oil-consuming countries to remember
it needs "security of demand" just as much as they need "security of
supply".

**[But weaponising oil production would break that understanding and
provoke a backlash from consuming countries with a concerted effort to
reduce their oil imports.]{.underline}**

Finally, **[Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for
security]{.underline}** (including the provision of advanced weapons
systems, training, intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and
aircraft stationed in and around the Gulf).

**[There is no way to wield the oil weapon which would not shake the
foundations of the U.S.-Saudi alliance on which the kingdom's defence
depends, leaving it vulnerable to regional rivals, including
Iran.]{.underline}**

**[For all these reasons, the oil weapon is essentially useless, an
unreliable blunderbuss more likely to blow up the user than its intended
target, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to deploy
it.]{.underline}**

### No Internal Link -- No Vision 2030

#### High oil prices [indefinetly postpone the Aramco IPO]{.underline}, prevents Vision 2030

**Obeid, Chatham House Energy, Environment and Resources Academy
Associate, 18**

\[Jessica Obeid, former chief energy engineer at the UN development
Programme in Beirut, US State Department TechWomen Fellow and UK Foreign
& Commonwealth Office International Leaders fellow, recognized by the

Double Bind on Oil Prices,\" Chatham House,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/saudi-arabia-double-bind-oil-prices,
accessed 6-30-2019, //CM\]

**[The]{.underline}** long-awaited **[sale of]{.underline}** a portion
of **[Saudi Aramco]{.underline}** -- closely **[linked to the overall
success of Vision 2030]{.underline}**, and emblematic of the opening up
of the Saudi economy -- **[has been billed as the world's biggest IPO,
with the ambition that the listing will put the value of the company
overall at some \$2 trillion.]{.underline}**

But **[investors are concerned about factors such as the competitiveness
of the eventual payout and the considerable uncertainty of investing in
a declining core industry at a time when major oil firms are
diversifying.]{.underline}** They will need to see the prospect of
sustained high oil prices in order to have confidence that there will be
worthwhile returns on oil investments at least within the next decade.

**[International firms in non-oil sectors are also wary of investing in
Saudi Arabia until they witness the reforms as set out in Vision 2030
kicking in and the barriers to private-sector participation
removed.]{.underline}**

According to the IMF, **[Saudi Arabia needs an oil price greater than
\$80 a barrel]{.underline}** (and in the range \$85--\$87 for the
current year) **[in order to balance its budget. As such, the economy
has suffered as a result of lower oil prices since the latter part of
2014.]{.underline}**

Pumping more oil and moving in on Iran's market share may increase
revenues and help to narrow the budget shortfall -- forecast at 7.3 per
cent of GDP in 2018, itself an improvement on the 8.9 per cent recorded
in 2017 -- and ease pressure on public spending. But this is a highly
risky strategy.

Saudi Arabia has set itself an ambitious revenue target of \$209 billion
in the budget for 2018, as well as an expansionary spending target of
\$261 billion -- a record high -- in an effort to pull the economy out
of the recession recorded in 2017. However, much will depend on whether
foreign direct investment, which dropped to just \$1.42 billion last
year (from \$7.45 billion in 2016) returns sooner rather than later.

**[If investor confidence doesn't pick up, the kingdom will have to
resort to its usual fix -- using oil revenues to increase public
spending -- to boost the economy. This is exactly the vicious circle
that Saudi Arabia is trying to break with the implementation of Vision
2030 and its diversification efforts specifically to reduce dependence
on oil.]{.underline}**

Furthermore it may also find itself in the position of having to impose
further taxes to allow additional public spending. But previous levies
(such as 'dependents taxes' for expatriates, and VAT), together with
cuts to subsidies, are already taking their toll, particularly on the
private sector. In this context, the authorities must consider the
likely impact of additional revenue-raising through taxes on Saudi
Arabia's ability to continue to attract workers from abroad to fill
existing skills gaps, as well as on critical efforts to increase Saudi
participation in the private sector over the longer term.

**[Saudi Arabia may have prevailed at the latest OPEC meeting, but its
various domestic and external interests will not all be served equally
well by what the agreed increase in production means for oil prices.
Without a coherent long-term strategy that reconciles these interests,
the kingdom risks falling short of its far-reaching
ambitions.]{.underline}**

### Internal Link Turn -- Vision 2030 Good -- Phosphate

#### Ensures smooth Saudi [defense manufacturing]{.underline} and [phosphate mining]{.underline}

**Johnson 16.** Keith Johnson\--reporting for Foreign Policy. \<APY\>
"Saudi Arabia Plans to Break its 'Addiction to Oil'," April 25, 2016.
http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/25/saudi-arabia-plans-to-break-its-addiction-to-oil-salman-vision-2030-aramco/

Undaunted, Prince **[Mohammed]{.underline}** now **[has his sights on
reinventing the Saudi economy.]{.underline}** He said
**[the]{.underline}** ambitious **[transformation]{.underline}**,
**[known as]{.underline}** "Saudi **[Vision 2030]{.underline}**," **[was
going to proceed "regardless of oil price,"]{.underline}** referring to
the 70 percent plunge in crude oil prices since their high in the summer
of 2014. In a way, he's right: Saudi Arabia has mulled plans to
diversify its economy away from excessive reliance on oil for a
quarter-century, though crude sales remain the lifeblood of the regime.
But cheaper oil puts more pressure on Saudi authorities to make changes.
Thanks to a glut of supply --- due to continued production by Saudi
Arabia, among other countries --- oil prices today hover around \$35 a
barrel. That has cost oil-exporting nations in the region about \$390
billion in the past year, the International Monetary Fund said, and
helped knock a \$120 billion hole in the Saudi budget. "Oil around \$30
is a blessing for the kingdom, because it forces them to move from being
a rentier state to a regular state," said Jean-François Seznec of the
Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center, who has written extensively on
the looming Saudi economic transformation. Even the public listing of
Aramco, which will mean opening up its books to public scrutiny, is part
and parcel of modernizing Saudi Arabia's opaque ruling culture, which is
still haunted by the specter of Arab Spring-style protests of the sort
that brought down governments in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya and sparked a
five-year civil war in Syria. "They're trying to throw the country and
the royal family into the 21st century," Seznec said. "Mohammed bin
Salman is disciplining the royal family to make it palatable to the 70
percent of the country under the age of 30. Ultimately, they are trying
to save the royal family from itself." Some of **[the main drivers of
the economic overhaul]{.underline}** --- **[such as a dysfunctional
labor market]{.underline}**, **[unskilled workers]{.underline}**, and
high unemployment --- **[are]{.underline}** also among **[the biggest
obstacles to transformation.]{.underline}** Saudi nationals make up less
than 10 percent of the private sector workforce and less than half the
workforce overall; foreign labor dominates many sectors, especially
construction. Labor participation is especially low for women in Saudi
Arabia, for religious and cultural reasons: Only about 20 percent of
Saudi women work, roughly the same level as in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
Those cultural and religious barriers --- including prohibitions on
alcohol and a strict crackdown on what clerics view as deviant behavior
--- are some of the obstacles to Prince Mohammed's planned opening,
making it unlikely that Saudi Arabia will become the next Dubai, a
glittering trading entrepôt open to expats and tourists alike. And
**[the financial and banking systems are only now opening up to foreign
investors.]{.underline}** The Saudi stock exchange, where Aramco will be
listed, only just allowed direct market access to foreign investors last
summer. The retail sector is still largely closed off. Yet, **[there
are]{.underline}** some **[reasons for optimism. Saudi Arabia's oil
wealth birthed a vibrant petrochemicals industry]{.underline}**, led by
Saudi Basic Industries Corp., **[one of the sector's global leaders. The
country has plenty of potential in mining and has cheap and abundant
reserves of bauxite used in aluminum production. It's]{.underline}**
also **[strong in phosphates and fertilizers.]{.underline}** **[The
plan]{.underline}** also **[calls for Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia, the
world's third-biggest buyer of arms, **[to domestically manufacture half
of its defense needs by 2030]{.underline}**, potentially **[giving
it]{.underline}** both **[an industrial boost and geopolitical insurance
for future defense procurement needs in an increasingly tense
neighborhood.]{.underline}** Consultants at McKinsey & Co. have advised
the Saudi government on its economic transformation. And the McKinsey
Global Institute, which published a study last year on the Saudi
economy, listed eight **[key sectors]{.underline}** --- **[including
metals and mining, petrochemicals]{.underline}**, manufacturing, and
tourism --- as **[vital]{.underline}** to doubling Saudi GDP by 2030.
Not coincidentally, most feature **[in the formal plan]{.underline}**,
and Prince Mohammed explicitly talked up the prospects of many of those
sectors in Monday's Al-Arabiya interview.

#### Collapsing phosphate supply causes global war

James **Elser** **and** Stuart **White**, 4-20-**10**, (\*Professor of
Ecology @ Arizona State University \*Director of the Institute for
Sustainable Futures \"Peak Phosphorus,\" Foreign Policy,
http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/20/peak-phosphorus

**[Phosphorus is used extensively for a variety of key functions in all
living things]{.underline}**, including the construction of DNA and cell
membranes. As it is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, **[a lack of
phosphorus is often the limiting factor in the growth of plants and
algae.]{.underline}** In humans, it plays an essential role in bone
formation. **[Without a steady supply of this resource, global
agricultural production will face a bottleneck, and humankind's growing
population will suffer a serious nutrition shortage.]{.underline}** The
world's reliance on phosphorus is an unappreciated aspect of the \"Green
Revolution,\" a series of agricultural innovations that made it possible
to feed the approximately 4.2 billion-person increase in the global
population since 1950. This massive expansion of global agricultural
production required a simultaneous increase in the supply of key
resources, including water and nitrogen. Without an increase in
phosphorus, however, crops would still have lacked the resources
necessary to fuel a substantial increase in production, and the Green
Revolution would not have gotten off the ground. Roosevelt's warning was
prescient and stimulated agricultural engineers to find an effective,
albeit temporary, solution. To satisfy the world's growing food demand,
they mobilized global mining efforts in ancient, phosphorus-rich marine
deposits. By 2008, industrial farmers were applying an annual 17 million
metric tons of mined phosphorus on their fields. Demand is expanding at
around 3 percent a year --- a rate that is likely to accelerate due to
rising prosperity in the developing world (richer people consume more
meat) and the burgeoning bioenergy sector, which also requires
phosphorus to support crop-based biofuels. **[Our supply of mined
phosphorus is running out. Many mines used to meet this growing demand
are degrading, as they are increasingly forced to access deeper layers
and extract a lower quality of phosphate-bearing rock]{.underline}**
(phosphate is the chemical form in which nearly all phosphorus is
found). Some initial analyses from scientists with the Global Phosphorus
Research Initiative estimate that there will not be sufficient
phosphorus supplies from mining to meet agricultural demand within 30 to
40 years. Although more research is clearly needed, **[this is not a
comforting time scale.]{.underline}** The geographic concentration of
phosphate mines also threatens to usher in an era of intense resource
competition. Nearly 90 percent of the world's estimated phosphorus
reserves are found in five countries: Morocco, China, South Africa,
Jordan, and the United States. In comparison, the 12 countries that make
up the OPEC cartel control only 75 percent of the world's oil reserves.
**[This fact could spark international tension and even influence how
countries attempt to draw their internal boundaries]{.underline}**. Many
of Morocco's phosphate mines are in Western Sahara, a disputed
independent territory that is occupied by Morocco and the site of
growing international human rights concerns. Reflecting these concerns,
U.N.-sanctioned export restrictions on phosphate and other resources are
now in place, though the efficacy of the bans is incomplete. China, the
country with the largest phosphorus reserves after Morocco, imposed a
135 percent tariff on the resource as part of 2008's complex series of
events in which rising fuel and fertilizer costs led to rapid increases
in food prices. The tariff effectively eliminated exports. Although the
tariff was subsequently lifted as the 2008 food crisis faded, the
imposition of this sort of trade barrier could become a regular
occurrence as supplies dwindle worldwide. The United States has only 12
phosphorus mines. The supplies from the most productive mine, in
Florida, are declining rapidly --- it will be commercially depleted
within 20 years. The United States exported phosphorus for decades but
now imports about 10 percent of its supply, all from Morocco, with which
it signed a free trade agreement in 2004. The effects of this resource
shortage will be felt long before the last phosphorus atom is extracted
from the last mine. Increased demand for fertilizer and the decreased
supply of phosphorus exports will result in higher prices, significantly
affecting millions of farmers in the developing world who live on the
brink of bankruptcy and starvation. Rising fertilizer prices could tip
this balance. Already, signs are emerging that our current practices
cannot continue for long. Between 2003 and 2008, phosphate fertilizer
prices rose approximately 350 percent. In 2008, rising food prices
sparked riots in more than 40 countries. Although the spike in
fertilizer prices was only partially responsible for the higher food
prices, the riots illustrate the social upheaval caused by disruptions
to the world's food supply. The 2008 food riots were only stopped by
government promises of food subsidies --- a viable strategy only as long
as governments can afford the ever-increasing costs of food support.
Establishing a reliable phosphorus supply is essential for assuring
long-term, sustainable food security. We need to dramatically reduce the
demand for phosphate rock by eliminating our wasteful practices. This
will require a combination of low-tech and high-tech solutions,
including efforts to prevent soil erosion, development of more-targeted
methods of fertilizer application, and the creation of new,
phosphorus-efficient crops, which produce a larger yield per phosphorus
unit applied. Fortunately, unlike fossil fuels, phosphorus can be used
over and over --- this is what occurs in natural ecosystems, where it is
recycled innumerable times from its first mobilization from the Earth's
crust to its eventual deposition into lake and ocean sediments. **[If we
fail to meet this challenge, humanity faces a Malthusian trap of
widespread famine on a scale that we have not yet experienced. The
geopolitical impacts of such disruptions will be severe, as an
increasing number of states fail to provide their citizens with a
sufficient food supply]{.underline}**. **[This dark scenario need not,
however, be our fate]{.underline}**. If we are successful in rising to
the phosphorus sustainability challenge, as well as other aspects of
sustainable agriculture, **[we can look forward to a future in which
families, communities, and countries are healthy and secure in their
nutrition and where all live in a world with cleaner rivers, lakes, and
oceans.]{.underline}**

National Security: **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and the UAE **[seek to
acquire and manufacture modern weapons to address a range
of]{.underline}** perceived **[national security threats.]{.underline}**
Both **[states live in a dangerous regional environment and see security
threats emanating primarily from two sources:]{.underline}** externally
from **[Iran]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** internally from
al-Qaeda-affiliated **[terrorists]{.underline}** and organized political
Islamists who can challenge the legitimacy and reign of the royal
families. But if the national security goals of Saudi Arabia and the UAE
can be met by purchasing the best arms from the United States and
elsewhere, it is worth asking why it is necessary for either country to
pursue a costly and challenging military industrialization program at
home that may not produce optimal results. Also, so long as Saudi Arabia
and the UAE are strategically partnered with the United States, their
survival should not be at risk, and thus there is little incentive for
them to further militarize. It is true that **[the United States does
not have a formal defense pact with either nation, but Washington's
commitment to the security of its Gulf partners has never been in
doubt]{.underline}** (at least in the minds of US policymakers). Indeed,
a major reason why Iran does not contemplate overt coercion or military
attack against its Gulf neighbors is because of the US-Gulf partnership.
**[Yet such a partnership notwithstanding, there is no substitute for
indigenous defensive capabilities. The ability to build powerful weapons
at home to withstand a surprise attack, a massive invasion, or any type
of major and prolonged military conflict is of utmost strategic
significance.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[the current political
environment in the region is especially unstable and the US-Gulf
partnership is experiencing turbulence and uncertainty due to lack of
trust primarily from the Gulf side.]{.underline}** This has heightened
threat perceptions in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi and has caused Saudi and
Emirati leaders to start thinking more independently and beyond their US
protector. **[While Iran is not at war with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**
and the UAE, **[tensions]{.underline}** do **[exist. Tehran has a fierce
rivalry and regional proxy confrontation]{.underline}** with the former
and an old territorial dispute with the latter over the islands of Abu
Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunb **[that has yet to be
resolved.]{.underline}**5 **[These factors alone provide]{.underline}**
an additional **[impetus for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and the UAE
**[to develop indigenous arms industries, especially if strains in the
US-Gulf partnership persist. Iran's]{.underline}** notable
**[capabilities of its own]{.underline}** in **[local
arms]{.underline}** production (specifically in the areas of ballistic
missiles and unmanned systems) **[further increases the
incentives]{.underline}** of the Saudis and the Emiratis to match and
possibly surpass their rival. In this context, military
industrialization follows a familiar "action-reaction" process, similar
to arms races.6

### Internal Link Turn -- Vision 2030 Good -- Gulf Stability

#### Vision 2030 is key to larger Gulf Stability

**Kotilaine, Bahrain Economic Development Board Chief Economic Advisor,
17**

\[Jarmo Kotilaine, 1-31-2017, \"Laying the foundations for long-term
Gulf prosperity,\" http://www.arabnews.com/node/1046891/columns,
accessed 7-2-2019, //CM\]

The agreements to control oil production that were concluded by key
producers at the end of last year triggered a major rally in **[oil
prices]{.underline}**. However, subject to conflicting forces, prices
continue to manifest volatility, and few people expect a rebound to the
levels of early 2014 any time soon. Rather, price **[volatility in a
significantly lower range than that seen in 2012-14 is now expected to
remain the norm for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**

**[This view has prompted all the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
governments to embark on, and persist with comprehensive fiscal reforms.
These efforts are ultimately designed to substantially curb the
vulnerability of government revenues and broader economic activity to
oil price volatility.]{.underline}** Beyond this, the focus of
policymakers is increasingly shifting toward more ambitious initiatives
to re-engineer their economic models in order to achieve sustainable
economic growth that is led by the private sector regardless of the oil
market dynamics**[. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is the latest addition to
the region's ambitious reform blueprints that put a clear emphasis on
delivering economic diversification and productivity-led
growth.]{.underline}**

Diversification is not new

**[The magnitude of the task at hand is great]{.underline}**, but it is
important to realize that the region is not starting from scratch or
seeking to navigate altogether uncharted waters. **[All regional
economies in the Gulf have pursued diversification strategies for years
and in some cases, these efforts have already had a transformative
impact on the structure of the economy.]{.underline}**

**[Bahrain has been a pioneer of many such policies with some key
initiatives going back nearly half a century.]{.underline}** If
anything, **[the pace of change has accelerated since the turn of the
century. The non-oil economy in the Kingdom has grown from just over
half]{.underline}** --- 56 percent --- **[of]{.underline}** real gross
domestic product (**[GDP]{.underline}**) **[in the year 2000 to more
than 80 percent at present.]{.underline}** **[One of the
benefits]{.underline}** of this transformation **[has been the
resilience of growth even in the current, challenging economic
environment]{.underline}**. Growth in Bahrain is firmly led by the
non-oil sector which grew by an annual 4.7 percent in the third quarter
of 2016, an increase from 3.6 percent in the second quarter. This leaves
the year-on-year rate of increase during the first three quarters of
2016 at 3.7 percent. This was in fact marginally ahead of the 3.6
percent rate achieved during 2015 as a whole.

This encouraging growth performance in Bahrain is largely attributable
to the value proposition of the economy that relies above all on human
capital, regulation, and connectivity as the sources of competitiveness
and growth. Bahrain has an educated national labor force, which is
overwhelmingly employed in the private sector. It has also established a
thriving entrepreneurial culture with a remarkable 70 percent of young
Bahrainis interested in starting their own company. Bahrain's regulatory
framework is both mature and liberal. For instance, 100 percent foreign
ownership is the norm in nearly all sectors of the economy.

Bahrain's open economy

As a small, open economy, Bahrain has always recognized the importance
of connectivity for its prosperity and several efforts to boost this
further are underway. Bahrain has a natural logistics cluster with the
shortest transfer time in the GCC between its logistics processing zones
and its transportation hubs. Goods can enter and exit the country in a
matter of hours, and be delivered by sea, land or air, through
state-of-the-art infrastructure into the hands of customers across the
region. This was further enhanced with the GCC Customs Union integration
to build on trade between the six countries.

Several endeavors are improving Bahrain's ability to service the broader
region. Last October, the World Bank's Doing Business report highlighted
the considerable progress made at accelerating processing times at the
King Fahd Causeway and included Bahrain among the 10 top improvers
globally in terms of regulations. The airport modernization program will
increase passenger capacity from 9 to 14 million and allow for far
larger volumes of cargo to be processed. A comprehensive feasibility
study has just been completed for a regional rail network that will link
the major commercial, administrative and cultural centers in the region.
And a second causeway connecting Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is in the
advanced planning stages.

Pipeline of projects

More generally, **[infrastructure investment has a critical role to play
as a growth driver in the economy at a time of volatile oil prices and
fiscal consolidation]{.underline}**. Bahrain has over \$32 billion worth
of strategically significant priority projects in the pipeline across a
range of sectors. The value of this pipeline is comparable to the
country's GDP.

Important ongoing or upcoming investments in Bahrain include ALBA's Line
6 Expansion Project, which will make the company the largest single-site
smelter and support the development of the region's downstream aluminum
industry. The new \$90 million Mondelez factory marks a major expansion
of the manufacturing giant's existing facilities in the Kingdom. Other
projects include a range of real estate, tourism, manufacturing, and
transportation investments.

While this **[ambitious mobilization of capital can help support growth
at a time of fiscal consolidation, the ultimate impact of the fiscal
re-engineering of growth is likely to be, if anything, even more
positive. For one thing, a strong commitment to fiscal stability is good
for confidence and credibility.]{.underline}**

Beyond this, the new operating environment for companies in the region
will create a powerful impetus for greater dynamism. Global experience
has shown over and over again that companies that do not face
predictable input prices are more likely to organize themselves more
efficiently and to innovate in various ways.

Sustainable value

**[Even the more established companies in the region face new
opportunities and incentives to seek growth through greater value chain
capture and innovation. As an example, important new initiatives are
underway in the downstream oil sector. They have the potential to create
more value and jobs, to diversify exports, and to ensure that a key
natural resource can be used to generate sustainable value whatever the
oil price environment. For a region where growth has for years been
almost entirely extensive, achieved through increases in inputs, this
paradigm shift is both important and encouraging. For at the end of the
day, it is only by increasing productivity that we can deliver sustained
increases in living standards.]{.underline}**

**[Market-based input pricing is also needed for a more efficient
allocation of resources. Goods that are served below market prices are
more likely to be wasted. Given that the GCC is a world leader in
per-capita water use, not to mention being highly energy intensive, this
is an important consideration. More generally, fiscal interventions can
be used to combat negative externalities, for instance, the consumption
of goods that damage public health.]{.underline}**

**[Significant economic paradigm shifts create new ways of addressing
current challenges and can drive growth and sustainability. By tackling
its fiscal challenges in earnest, the region is addressing a short-term
problem but also, and much more important, laying the foundations for
long-term prosperity.]{.underline}**

## Impact

### No Impact -- Dollar Heg

#### Effects of the strength of the dollar are overstated

**Weiner, editor for NPR, 07** \[Eric Weiner, 10/3/07, NPR, "Is a Weak
Dollar Really So Terrible?",
<https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14901181>,
accessed 7/1/19\]//CJ

The dollar is in free fall, or so it seems. **[In 2002, you could buy a
euro for 86 cents. Today, it will cost you \$1.40]{.underline}**. You\'d
have to go back at least a decade to find a time when the U.S. dollar
was so weak. Against some currencies, such as the Canadian dollar (the
\"loonie\"), you\'d have to go back 30 years. It sounds ominous, but is
a weak dollar really so terrible?

Not necessarily**[. A weak dollar can be good for the U.S. economy,
because it makes American exports cheaper and, therefore, helps close
the trade deficit]{.underline}**. But over the long term, the value of a
country\'s currency is seen as a verdict on the overall health of its
economy.

**[It\'s difficult --- impossible, some economists say --- to tease out
the effects of a weak dollar from all of the other variables affecting
the economy at any moment. But one thing is clear: The weak dollar
creates ripples around the world. Some of those ripples are good, some
bad]{.underline}**. But that, too, is relative. Where you stand on the
weak dollar depends largely on where you sit.

**[The most obvious effect of a weak U.S. dollar is its impact on
American tourists traveling to Europe]{.underline}**. In Paris, \$7 cups
of coffee and \$50 taxi rides are suddenly de rigueur. A weak dollar
affects even those American consumers who never leave home. If you have
a penchant for German cars or French wine, expect to pay more, as
European manufacturers raise prices to compensate for the weak dollar.

**[In fact, some economists warn of an \"umbrella effect\" --- the
tendency for the prices of all goods and services to rise once a few do.
Other economists, though, say the risk of inflation is exaggerated. The
core inflation rate, they point out, remains low --- about 2 percent ---
despite the dollar\'s recent slide.]{.underline}**

Why? For one thing, European manufacturers tend to give American
consumers a break. Weak dollar or not, they\'re reluctant to raise
prices and lose market share. The U.S. market is simply too large and
lucrative.

The biggest mitigating factor, though, is China. As any trip to Wal-Mart
reveals, many of the consumer goods sold in the U.S. are now made in
China, and the Chinese currency, the yuan, is, in effect, pegged to the
dollar, so fluctuations on the currency market don\'t greatly affect
prices for Chinese-made goods.

No such cushion, though, applies to oil prices. They are high, hovering
near a record of \$80 a barrel, and that is due, in part, to the weak
dollar: Oil-rich nations charge higher prices to compensate for the
weaker dollar.

On the other hand, the weak dollar is very good news for European
tourists visiting the United States --- and for the American retailers
who cater to them. The reason is simple: The British pound and the Euro
go a lot farther than they used to.

\"America is on sale,\" says Patricia Edwards, a managing director of
Wentworth, Hauser and Violich, a financial consulting firm. \"It\'s like
walking into Macy\'s and finding that everything is 30 percent off. You
might buy more than you would otherwise.\"

**[A weak dollar is also good news for American manufacturers. Their
products are now less expensive, so they can sell more. That\'s why
companies such as Boeing and Caterpillar like a weak dollar. It\'s also
why many economists like it: As these big U.S. manufacturers sell more,
the U.S. trade deficit shrinks.]{.underline}**

### No Impact -- Oil Supplies Resilient

#### Saudi oil cut irrelevant, America has increased supply

**Soreng and Narayanan, editors for Reuter, 6/28** \[Eileen Soreng and
K. Sathya Narayanan, 6/28/19, Reuters, "Sluggish demand to squeeze oil
price gains as OPEC+ seen stemming supply: Reuters poll",
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-prices-idUSKCN1TT1GZ>, accessed
6/28/19\]//CJ

**[Oil prices could stall as a slowing global economy squeezes demand
and U.S. crude floods the market]{.underline}**, despite an expected
extension by OPEC and its allies of their output-cutting pact next week,
a Reuters monthly poll showed on Friday.

**[The survey of 42 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude would
average \$67.59 a barrel in 2019, a downward revision from the \$68.84
estimate in May, and just above the \$66.17 average for the global
benchmark so far this year.]{.underline}**

"Currently, the **[oil market is more focused on the demand side of the
story]{.underline}** amid rising trade tensions," ANZ analyst Daniel
Hynes said.

A decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and
other producers on whether to extend their production curbs would "set
the supply story" for the second half of 2019 and into 2020, Hynes
added.

Analysts forecast global demand to grow by 0.9--1.3 million barrels per
day (bpd) in 2019, versus the 1.2--1.4 million bpd forecast in May.

OPEC and the International Energy Agency have also downwardly revised
their forecasts for demand growth, putting it at 1.14 million and 1.2
million bpd respectively.

All eyes will now be on a meeting of OPEC and allies including Russia on
Monday and Tuesday to discuss an extension in order to support prices.

Most analysts expect the so-called OPEC+ to extend the agreement,
although some uncertainty remains over Moscow's continued cooperation.

"Oil prices could see some upside if Russia agrees to comply, or if OPEC
agrees to cut its quotas further," said Oliver Allen, economist at
Capital Economics.

"A decision by OPEC \... to roll over its production cuts would probably
put a floor under oil prices."

**[Increasing production from the United States could also keep prices
under pressure]{.underline}**, analysts said.

"**[In the medium to long term, we believe that U.S. supply growth will
put a cap on oil prices and make it less probable to see prices over
\$70 per barrel in the absence of supply shock]{.underline}**s," said
Adria Morron Salmeron, an economist at CaixaBank Research.

## Impact Turn -- High Prices Good

### Impact Turn - Econ

#### High oil prices bolster American economy; low prices burn money

**Richter, editor-in-chief at Wolf Street, 19** \[Wolf Richter, 6/20/19,
Wolf Street, "Bring on Higher Oil Prices: They'll Boost the US Economy.
Powell Sees it Too. A New Experience for the US",
<https://wolfstreet.com/2019/06/20/bring-on-higher-oil-prices-theyll-boost-the-us-economy-powell-sees-it-too-new-experience-for-the-us/>,

Powered by the iffy situation in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz,
and the Gulf of Oman, with attacks on tankers and now the downing of a
US drone, the price of crude oil got a little nervous in recent days.
WTI jumped about 6% today to over \$57 a barrel.

But this was just a minor uptick in the overall scheme of things: **[The
US, which has become the largest oil producer in the world, is in the
middle of its second oil bust in five years:]{.underline}**

These two oil busts are **[largely a consequence of surging US crude oil
production. During the oil bust of 2014-2016, the price of WTI collapsed
by over 75%, careening from \$107 per barrel to a low of \$27 per barrel
in 18 months]{.underline}**, before starting to rebound. In the process,
a slew of oil-and-gas drillers filed for bankruptcy.

For a while it looked like the shale boom, where all the growth in
production had come from, was running out of money, and therefore out of
fuel. **[Production fell sharply from early 2015 through much of 2016,
but then new money from Wall Street appeared, and production began to
soar again, hitting new records all along the way.]{.underline}**

Shale wells produce a variety of liquid hydrocarbons (they also produce
gaseous hydrocarbons which are not included here). This production of
crude oil and petroleum products soared from just over 7 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2010 to 16.6 million bpd currently, according to EIA
data:

**[This surge in production comes even as shale oil-and-gas drillers
have essentially been cash-flow negative in their entire history,
drilling more and more of their investors' funds forever into the
ground. But so far so good --- as long as it's not my
money.]{.underline}**

The US used to be the largest net importer of crude oil and petroleum
products in the world. Between 2005 and 2008, "net imports" (imports
minus exports) of crude oil and petroleum products exceeded 12 million
bpd**[. But surging production in the US has slashed imports. And
recently exports have surged, and the trade in crude oil and petroleum
products is now nearly balanced between the US and the rest of the
world. And the net imports are heading toward zero -- the point where
the US imports as much as it exports.]{.underline}**

In February, net imports were down to just 176,000 barrels a day, the
lowest in the EIA data going back to 1971. In March, the most recent
data available, net imports were 842,000 barrels a day:

T**[he fact that the US imports a lot of crude oil and petroleum
products, even as it exports a lot too, is related to a variety of
factors and market conditions.]{.underline}**

For example, **[California is the fourth largest oil producing state in
the US, but it's not enough. It's not connected via pipelines to
producing regions east of the Rocky Mountains. So it gets some oil by
oil train. It imports oil from Alaska. And it imports the rest from
other countries.]{.underline}**

**[But California's refineries also export gasoline to Mexico and other
countries -- try to explain this to Californians who groan under high
gasoline prices! This mismatch of supply and demand, lacking
infrastructure, and global factors plays out across the US and leads to
a mix of imports and exports.]{.underline}**

The US has become a huge oil producer despite the cash-burning
characteristics of the shale oil business. But **[the very fact that the
shale oil business burns so much cash makes it a large contributor to
the US economy as every dollar that gets "burned" is actually spent in
the US and gets recycled in the US economy]{.underline}**.

The jobs are well paid. The business has a large high-tech component,
involving highly paid technology employees and contractors, along with
expensive specialized tech equipment and software. In addition, it
involves sophisticated heavy equipment in the field that is fabricated
in factories around the US. It involves transportation to get this
equipment and supplies to the oil field. It involves the construction of
infrastructure, such as pipelines and oil storage facilities, processing
facilities, and the like.

Oil-and-gas related industries and their suppliers weigh heavily in US
industrial production and manufacturing, but also in services such as
engineering.

**[Back when the US was the largest net-importer of crude oil in the
world, any increase in the price of oil siphoned most of this money out
of the US economy to oil-producing countries.]{.underline}** As
consumers and businesses had to shift spending dollars from US products
to products based on imported oil, a big surge in oil prices -- the "oil
shock" -- could trigger a recession.

**[This picture has now completely changed]{.underline}**. And Fed Chair
Jerome Powell made note of it during the post-meeting press conference
on Wednesday.

While there are some strengths in the US economy, such as services and
consumer spending, he said, there are also some weak spots, particularly
business investment and manufacturing production. He listed a number of
factors, including "**[lower oil prices." They not only contribute to
"lower investment," but also to lower manufacturing production as
purchases of new equipment are put on hold.]{.underline}**

This is already showing up. The plunge in oil prices since August has
caused the oil-and-gas sector to get skittish with capital expenditures
this year, and Powell picked up on that. Investment in the US shale
sector has a big impact on the real economy.

This became apparent during the 2014-16 oil bust when the sector
drastically cut back on investing. The overall economy started to slow
in 2015, and in 2016, GDP growth was just 1.6%, the worst since the
Great Recession. When the shale patch recovered, economic growth
accelerated.

**[A higher oil price, say over \$75 a barrel, would unleash investment
in the US oil patch, and it would unleash orders for new equipment and
services. When companies invest in US shale oil, it triggers a whole
chain of activities in the real economy.]{.underline}**

Then Powell touched upon the other side of the coin of lower oil prices:
Consumers pay less for gasoline. Conversely, they would pay more for
gasoline when oil prices are higher. Consumers hate paying more for
gasoline. But here is the thing:

**[Whatever amount consumers spend on gasoline is part of "Consumer
Spending" which accounts for about 70% of GDP. So, when gasoline prices
rise, consumers with limited budgets shift some of their spending from
Walmart's imported doodads to gasoline]{.underline}**. In this scenario,
gasoline sales would rise a lot and Walmart doodad sales would fall
some, and it would all flow into "consumer spending."

But **[gasoline in the US is now mostly a made-in-the-USA
product]{.underline}** (see the trade data above, third chart), **[and
most of the money spent on gasoline goes into the US economy, and stays
in the US economy, and is not siphoned out by OPEC or other producing
countries.]{.underline}**

**[Imported doodads siphon money out of the US economy (imports are a
negative value in the GDP formula). So every dollar a consumer shifts
away from imported doodads to gasoline ends up boosting the overall US
economy]{.underline}** -- though it might slow China's economy a tad.

### Impact Turn - Russia

#### Turn -- high oil good -- prevents Russia growth

**Friedman, geopolitical forecaster, international affairs strategist,
and Geopolitical Futures founder and chairperson, 17**

\[George Friedman, 1-4-2017, \"Low Oil Prices Will Make Russia More
Aggressive in 2017,\" Newsmax,
https://www.newsmax.com/Finance/GeorgeFriedman/oil-russia-prices-crude/2017/01/04/id/766787/,
accessed 6-28-2019, //CM\]

**[Russia has had a hard time since the collapse of global oil prices
which began in August 2014. This will continue in 2017. The Russian
people are starting to feel the effects of prolonged low oil prices.
This was bound to happen. And this will shape Moscow\'s foreign policy
in the year to come.]{.underline}**

Russia's money problems start with the economy's structure. **[The
country's budget depends on income from oil exports. Low oil prices have
had huge effects. And the country hasn't even recovered from the 2008
decline.]{.underline}**

**[Little to no investment was made in industrial alternatives. And
almost no money was used to increase efficiency or to add new
technology.]{.underline}**

Low oil prices hurt

Signs of bad times started being seen in late 2012. Russia's 2016 budget
had planned for oil prices at \$50 per barrel, and the deficit target
was set at 3 percent. The drop in oil prices means less income. And that
means the budget will not be met.

**[Russia can't control the price of oil. So, it needs to find other
ways to manage its budget. So far, this includes cuts in government
spending (except in defense and social services). And there are plans to
privatize some state-owned companies.]{.underline}**

**[Prolonged low oil prices have had an impact on Russia\'s
economy]{.underline}**. GDP per capita in Russia is down from an
all-time high of \$11,615 in 2013 to \$11,038 in 2015. Wages fell by 9
percent in 2015. And more than 2 million people fell into poverty.

**[In the first three months of 2016, inflation fell from 12.9 percent
to 7.4 percent. That is the factor that worries Russia the most. Still,
the central bank refused to cut the interest rate. At the same time,
wages rose more than 5 percent. This is the first time since 2014 they
have surpassed the rate of inflation.]{.underline}**

And the people are suffering

**[The big danger for Russia, though, is how the oil price problem is
affecting people. Wages over the last two years have had no real growth.
The poverty level has increased. Now there are reports of food costing
50 percent or more of a person\'s income. People are starting to grow
some of their own food so they can still eat some of what they can't
afford to buy in stores.]{.underline}**

**[As a result, Russians' despair has grown. A rising number of small,
local protests have occurred. These often relate to specific economic
issues, particularly pensions. The number of protests in big cities has
declined, but protests in small cities have increased by 40 percent in
the last year---according to the FNPR, the country's largest workers'
association.]{.underline}**

Making things worse are reports of **[wage arrears in different regions.
These reports are becoming more common. Wage arrears in Russia totaled
3.8 billion rubles]{.underline}** (\$62 million) as of July 1, 2016.
About a quarter of these delayed payments were the past month\'s pay for
workers. About 30 percent, though, dated back to 2014 or 2013.

**[Reports of bankruptcies are also on the rise.]{.underline}** One of
the most troubling cases thus far deals with UralVagonZavod (UVZ). This
is a corporation that consists of 40 entities and is among the world's
top 100 largest military-industrial companies. Three
entities---Alfa-Bank, Barnaul Forge and Press Plant, and Central Boiler
and Turbine Institution---have filed bankruptcy petitions in court
against UVZ in the last few months due to unpaid debts.

So Putin will strut like a peacock

In response to these growing domestic pressures, **[President Putin has
spent 2016 trying to further consolidate his power. He created the
Council for Strategic Development and Priority Projects. This council
aims to change things in the economy and the social sphere and to
increase economic growth rates.]{.underline}**

In an effort to show strength, **[Putin also revamped some of the
branches of security bodies. Russia will continue to legitimize the
regime in Moscow to those who suffer economically. They will do this by
showing Russian power worldwide without really doing
anything.]{.underline}**

**[The worse the Russian economy gets, the bigger these shows of power
will have to be]{.underline}**. Moscow will engage in strategic regions
of the world in 2017 with warlike talk and potential military posturing.
