#### Fiscal deadlines [will be resolved]{.underline} -- failure threatens the [economy]{.underline} via the US defaulting on their debt and collapsed investor confidence -- [uniqueness doesn't overwhelm]{.underline} the link because there are still "policy challenges," Trump, and things have gotten off to a slow start

[[Top]{.mark} Senate [Republicans are urging]{.mark} the White House
to]{.underline}ward [[a]{.mark} government [spending and debt]{.mark}
limit [deal]{.mark} that House [Democrats can accept,
as]{.mark}]{.underline} lawmakers \-- and
[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- [[cast **an increasingly nervous
eye**]{.mark} **toward looming fiscal deadlines**]{.underline}.

Majority Leader Mitch [[McConnell convened a]{.underline} **[high-stakes
meeting]{.underline}**]{.mark} Wednesday [with]{.underline} Treasury
Secretary Steven [Mnuchin]{.underline}, Acting White House Chief of
Staff Mick [Mulvaney]{.underline}, Senate Appropriations Chairman
Richard [Shelby and other Republicans **[to forge a
deal]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that would]{.underline}]{.mark} **[avert
another government shutdown]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[relieve]{.mark} market [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** [about a
debt ceiling standoff. This]{.underline} unified plan [would be
their]{.underline} [opening offer]{.underline} in talks
[with]{.underline} congressional [Democrats]{.underline}.

[["We are]{.underline} **[making progress]{.underline}**]{.mark} on
where the Senate wants to go and the White House wants to go," [[Shelby
said]{.underline}]{.mark} as he left the meeting. He said [Mnuchin
offered ideas]{.underline} that [Republicans will take to Democratic
leaders]{.underline}.

Mnuchin said [the White House \`\`preference\'\' is to include the debt
ceiling in the deal Congress must strike to fund the
government]{.underline}.

[[Lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[were]{.underline}
**[optimistic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [about a budget deal]{.underline}
**[[despite]{.mark} the policy [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [But
any agreement]{.underline} **[could still be
scuttled]{.underline}**]{.mark} [by]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump, even though he has the most to lose from the **economic fallout
of a debt default or shutdown**]{.underline} heading into the 2020
election.

[[With **just**]{.mark} **over [three months left]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[until the Sept. 30 end of the]{.underline} current [fiscal year,
[the]{.mark} annual budget [process has once again **gotten**]{.mark}
**off to [a slow start.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The Senate has yet to begin debating its]{.underline} 12 annual
[spending]{.underline} bills for next year [as]{.underline} the
[Appropriations]{.underline} Committee [**waits** for]{.underline}
congressional [leaders to agree on the overall]{.underline} spending
[limit]{.underline}.

"[We're **hopeful that we are making progress**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}ward [getting a caps agreement **so we can get
started**]{.underline} with the Appropriations process," [McConnell told
reporters]{.underline} after the meeting, in reference to the
budget-caps deal that would set spending levels.

The Democratic-led House, on the other hand, is voting on some of its
spending bills this week, although the policies and level of government
outlays represent progressive Democratic priorities \-- without
bipartisan approval.

The first package of four House spending bills, which includes Defense
and totals \$1 trillion, will get a vote this week. The White House has
threatened to veto what it described as an "attack" on Trump's agenda
for, among other things, blocking the transfer of funds for his border
wall.

'Draconian' Spending Cuts

[[McConnell is]{.underline} **[eager to broker a
two-year]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[budget [deal]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[between the White House and]{.underline} congressional [Democrats that
would also increase the \$22 trillion U.S. borrowing limit]{.underline},
which came back into effect in March. [[Without an increase,
Treasury]{.underline} **[would begin defaulting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**on U.S. payment obligations** this fall, according to independent
estimates]{.underline}.

#### Chances of default are [tiny]{.underline} except for [new fights]{.underline} and [lack of time]{.underline}

**Sherman 4/30** \-\-\-- Erik, contributor to *Forbes*, *NBC News*, and
*Fortune*, "\'Debt Ceiling\' May Become a Political Buzzword This
Summer," *Fortune*, 2019,
http://fortune.com/2019/04/30/debt-ceiling-economy-politics/

"I don't think the markets are going to move in any material way until
they get extraordinarily close to that outcome," said Tony Roth, chief
investment officer for Wilmington Trust. [The [chance of]{.mark} a
[default]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[should be tiny]{.underline}**, [except
for]{.underline}]{.mark} [two factors:]{.underline} **[[time and
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Without pressure]{.mark} in advance, [and there
is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[seldom]{.mark} public
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [Congress will do nothing **until it
returns**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**from its August recess**. "Probably in
conjunction with whatever]{.underline} the government
[funding]{.underline} that [has to pass before September 30," said
Kumar, with [the additional need of a spending bill]{.mark}
**[complicating the picture.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Politics]{.underline} **[could make things]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[even [muddier]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the "Democrats in charge
of the House, some of the Republicans may think they have more to gain
politically by pushing it to the wall and try to blame the House," said
Joe White, a professor of political science at Case Western Reserve
University. "The Republicans think that the problem is spending and the
public is on their side, or at least \[they are\] convinced, so there
may be real interest on the Republican side in debt ceiling games. And
who knows what the President's preference is?"

In December 2018, when the House and Senate had reached a compromise on
spending, the president refused to sign the bill because it didn't
include the funding he wanted for border security, including the wall. A
previous immigration deal fell through at the last minute when issue
hard-liners pulled Trump back.

With House Democrats promising ongoing investigations, a deal could be
harder to reach.

But [one things **for sure**]{.underline}: [[If Congress can't
agree]{.mark} on a ceiling]{.underline}, [**[the market will go through
the floor]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Plan causes [massive fights]{.underline} that [derail the debt ceiling]{.underline}

**Aitken 13** (Aaron, Graduate student in International Affairs at
\@CU_NPSIA, "The Future of U.S.-Taiwan Arms Sales"
<http://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/ps_sandbox/article/download/19032/14712>)

[[Abandoning Taiwan would]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [force the
United States to overcome a number of challenging domestic obstacles.
The most significant obstacle to halting arms sales is that it would
[require]{.mark}]{.underline} ending or [[modifying]{.mark} the
[TRA]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the TRA is a piece of domestic
legislation, [[this would **require the consent of
Congress**]{.underline}.]{.mark} There are [two factors]{.underline}
that [make this unlikely]{.underline}. First, [the domestic [defense
industry]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States, which [has [a
**powerful lobbying arm**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[has a vested interest
in]{.mark} continuing [arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
2006-2009 period, Taiwan ranked fourth among global U.S. arms
customers.29 As such, the [defense lobby]{.underline} has and [will
likely continue to have a significant impact on Taiwanese
policy]{.underline} within the United States. Perhaps [most
famously]{.underline}, both [[Clinton and Bush]{.underline}]{.mark} Sr.
[[supported]{.mark} the [sale]{.mark}]{.underline} of F-16s to Taiwan in
1992 [[in **hopes of winning votes**]{.mark} by protecting the [defense
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Given the current tough economic
circumstances in the U.S., [such a strategy will likely continue to
[have]{.mark} **[considerable appeal for lawmakers]{.mark},** which
defense lobbyists will be more than happy to point out]{.underline}.
Secondly, [[Congress has had a **long-standing pro-Taiwanese
stance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2011, [a bipartisan group of over
forty-five senators actively supported selling Taiwan new
F-16]{.underline} C/D fighter craft.31 [[Given the overwhelming
pro-Taiwanese disposition]{.mark} of Congress, ending or
[modifying]{.mark} the [TRA would require]{.mark} the expenditure of
**[considerable political capital]{.mark}** on behalf of the
administration, and there seems to be no such inclination at this
time]{.underline}. Just as designed, the TRA essentially prevents the
administration from unilaterally abandoning Taiwan under pressure from
China.

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how [[economic
considerations]{.mark} within states [can figure **prominently
into**]{.mark} **the calculus for [future
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The findings also suggest that
[security issues with economic or financial underpinnings will transcend
classical determinants of war and conflict, and change the manner by
which rival states engage in hostile acts toward one
another]{.underline}. The research shows that [security concerns
emanating from [economic uncertainty]{.mark} and the inherent
vulnerabilities within global financial markets [will present new
challenges for national security]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} provide
developing [states new asymmetric options for balancing]{.mark} [against
stronger states]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ [The security areas]{.underline},
identified in the proceeding chapters, [are [likely to mature into
**global security threats**]{.mark} in the immediate
future]{.underline}. As the case study on South Korea suggest, [the
overlapping security issues associated with economic decline and reduced
military spending by the United States will **affect allied confidence
in America's security guarantees**]{.underline}. The study shows that
[this outcome could cause **regional instability** or realignments of
strategic partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with ramifications for
U.S. national security]{.underline}. [[Rival states]{.mark} and
non-state groups [may]{.mark} also [become **emboldened to challenge
America**]{.mark}**'s status**]{.underline} in the unipolar
international system.¶ [The potential risks associated with **stolen or
[loose WMD]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [resulting from poor security,
[can]{.mark} also [pose a threat to]{.mark} U.S. national
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The case study on Pakistan, Syria and
North Korea show how [financial constraints affect weapons security
making weapons vulnerable to theft, and how [financial factors can
influence WMD proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline} by contributing to the
motivating factors behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons
technology. The [inherent [vulnerabilities within]{.mark} the global
financial [markets will provide terrorists']{.mark} organizations and
other non-state groups]{.underline}, who object to the current
international system or distribution of power, [with [opportunities
to]{.mark} disrupt global finance and perhaps [weaken America's
status]{.mark}]{.underline}.

## \*\*\* UNIQUENESS

### Thumpers\-\--A2: Investigations

#### Prefer issue-specific uniqueness -- Wasson and Sherman [assume the current political climate]{.underline} and [still conclude]{.underline} that fiscal deadlines will [probabilistically]{.underline} be met

#### Investigations [don't thump]{.underline} -- Trump's delay strategy is failing, investigations are moving fast, and it's absurd to say that Congress can't legislate and investigate at the same time

Atlantic,*
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/harder-trump-fights-impeachment-more-likely-it/590119/>

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has many things to be upset about. His
feint on infrastructure came to nothing: Pelosi and Schumer were happy
to go along with his plan, but he couldn't rally Republican support for
it. His former spokeswoman Hope Hicks has just been subpoenaed by the
House Judiciary Committee. And his [strategy of [stonewalling]{.mark}
Congress in the face of]{.underline} Democratic [investigations [is
**unraveling**]{.mark} **quickly**]{.underline}. [[There]{.underline}
**[never seemed]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to be much [hope]{.mark} that
[it would block]{.mark} the [probes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [altogether;
instead, the goal appeared to be to bog down the process and run out the
clock]{.underline} before the 2020 election.

On Wednesday, however, [[a federal judge]{.underline}]{.mark} in New
York [**[ruled against Trump's effort]{.underline}** [to block a
subpoena]{.underline}]{.mark} from House Democrats [of his financial
records]{.underline} from Deutsche Bank and Capital One. [That
came]{.underline} a day [after]{.underline}
**[[another]{.underline}]{.mark}** [federal judge [rejected his bid to
keep his accounting firm]{.mark}]{.underline}, Mazars USA, [[from
turning over documents]{.mark}; that judge]{.underline} refused to stay
his order pending appeal, and [seemed]{.underline}
**[incredulous]{.underline}** [at the administration's
argument]{.underline}s. NBC News reports that two [other
[banks]{.mark}]{.underline}, TD and Wells Fargo, have [**[already handed
over documents]{.underline}**. [The process is moving]{.underline}
**[much faster than Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[had
[hoped]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Instead of eating up months, his
[refusals]{.mark} to comply [have]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**barely**
eaten up weeks]{.underline}.]{.mark}

So [Trump is suggesting he won't work with Democrats]{.underline} on
anything [until they drop]{.underline} their [investigations. "It is not
possible]{.underline} for them [to investigate and legislate at the same
time," he tweeted]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[being able to
do]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}** [oversight and
lawmaking]{.underline} **[is]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[precisely [how
Congress is structured]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [as
veterans]{.underline} of any previous administration [can
attest]{.underline}, **[[plenty can get done while Congress is
investigating]{.mark} a White House]{.underline}**.

[[The White House]{.underline}]{.mark} **[still [wants]{.mark} to reach

raise the]{.underline} nation's [debt limit]{.underline}, **[[even
though]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[said he will not negotiate with
Democrats until they stop investigating]{.mark} his administration,
a]{.underline} **[senior official]{.underline}** [said]{.underline} on
Thursday.

**[["We're not looking for a shutdown]{.mark},"]{.underline}** Vice
President [Pence's chief of staff]{.underline}, Marc [[Short, told

extended to the budget talks. [["The White House **has been

["You certainly want to start thinking about debt ceiling risk,"
says]{.underline} GeoQuant CEO Mark [Rosenberg, whose firm
uses]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence-powered [indexes to measure]{.underline}
various types of [political risk.]{.underline} One of his tools ---
[[the "Mueller Risk Index,"]{.mark} which measures the likelihood of
Trump's early removal]{.underline} from office --- [[has
been]{.underline} **[trending down]{.underline}**]{.mark} [since
the]{.underline} release of the special [counsel's report.]{.underline}

But [his measure of [institutional support]{.mark} for the president
shows Trump [is at]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[one of his weakest
points]{.underline}**]{.mark} in his ability to bend the branches of
government to his will. And, significantly, [[it shows Trump]{.mark}'s
grip **[weakening further]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as the summer wears
on]{.underline}:

[The index, [Rosenberg]{.mark} explains, is "an aggregate of projections
for]{.underline} a number of [issues relative to institutional
support]{.underline} --- [investigations]{.underline} of the president,
legislative [debates]{.underline}, [legal battles, appointments and
confirmations\" and more,]{.underline} **[including the fight over the
debt ceiling itself]{.underline}**. [He **[isn't]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
however, [[ready to predict]{.mark} a debt [default]{.mark}
yet]{.underline}. "To the extent there's an upcoming calendared event
where the elevated institutional risk could have a market impact, that
is it... But the [pattern is **pretty clear**]{.underline}: [[So long
as]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[data supports the bull market, **it's
unlikely**]{.mark} **that [politics will derail
it,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[he says, adding]{.mark} the administration
and [lawmakers]{.mark}]{.underline} probably **[[will forge a
deal]{.mark} to head off a default]{.underline}**.

[[A **senior**]{.underline} [Trump official
appeared]{.underline}]{.mark} [determined [to communicate
that]{.mark}]{.underline} message [to markets]{.underline} on Wednesday,
telling CNBC's Eamon Javers that [[Trump's
ultimatum]{.underline}]{.mark} to Democrats **[[wouldn't hold up]{.mark}
progress toward deals on the [debt]{.mark} ceiling [and]{.mark}
government [funding]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is primed to run out
Sept. 30. "[[Debt ceiling is]{.underline}
**[must-pass]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [as is Govt funding," [the official
texted]{.mark} Javers]{.underline}. "So no, [[that **isn't
precluded**]{.underline}]{.mark} by what happened today."

[It wasn't long ago]{.underline} that [investors drew a direct link
between]{.underline} the [investigations]{.underline} dogging the
president [and]{.underline} policy outcomes critical to [economic
performance.]{.underline}

In May 2017, the revelation that Trump pressured former FBI director
James Comey to drop a probe of Michael Flynn, the president's former
national security adviser, set off one of the steepest stock dives of
the year. The fear at the time was that Trump's presidency would unravel
before he could deliver major corporate tax cuts and deregulation.

Financiers flooded Washington analysts with questions about impeachment
procedures and stopped in their tracks when Trump-related alerts popped
up on their Bloomberg terminals. In June, when Comey testified before
the Senate Intelligence Committee, both CNBC and Bloomberg TV carried
the hearing live.

Interest cooled as summer turned to fall that year and it became clearer
the tax cuts were more or less on a glide path to passage.

**[Lately]{.underline}**, [[investors have appeared]{.underline} **[less
spooked]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}]{.mark} the specter of
[Washington [dysfunction]{.mark}]{.underline}: The [[S&P]{.mark}
500]{.underline} **[actually [gained]{.mark}]{.underline}** about [11
percent [during the]{.mark}]{.underline} month-long government
[[shutdown]{.underline}]{.mark} that ended in January. And [[with
deadlines]{.mark} for the debt ceiling and]{.underline} a
[budget]{.underline} deal still [[months away, it's]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} market [[participants will start
to]{.mark} [fixate on]{.mark} those [negotiations]{.mark}
soon]{.underline}.

["Obviously this is]{.underline} a [concerning]{.underline} headline,
**[but]{.underline}** [[there is a meaningful difference between]{.mark}
fiscal [brinkmanship today versus]{.mark} fiscal brinkmanship [weeks
awa]{.mark}y from the debt ceiling deadline,"]{.underline} Isaac
[Boltansky]{.underline}, director of policy research at Compass Point,
[said]{.underline} in an email.

["There is a confluence of]{.underline} political [risk in the
fall]{.underline} with the debt ceiling and spending deadline,
**[but]{.underline}** I think [[the market]{.mark} **still [expects a
resolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} on these fiscal fights. Instead, these
comments reinforce our bearishness on the prospects for other efforts
such as infrastructure spending or prescription drug pricing."

Ahead of the Wednesday meeting, [[Mulvaney expressed]{.underline}
**[optimism]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that they could strike a
deal]{.underline}** [on the spending levels and]{.underline} the [debt
ceiling]{.underline}.

[["We **are going to fund the government**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
only question is]{.underline} at [what level," he said]{.underline}
Tuesday at a Wall Street Journal event, [[adding]{.underline} **[he
doesn't see]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [automatic cuts]{.mark}
happening]{.underline}**. [["I do **not** see it]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[[being]{.underline}]{.mark} a [very [dramatic]{.mark}]{.underline}
event this year."

The current budget cap is \$716 billion for defense funds and \$597
billion for non-defense domestic spending. Democrats have proposed a
\$17 billion in crease for defense to \$733 billion and a \$34 billion
increase for non-defense to \$631 billion.

Trump's budget proposed increasing defense spending by \$34 billion to
\$750 billion, using a budget gimmick, while allowing non-defense
outlays to be cut by \$30 billion to \$567 billion.

Republican House spending panel member Tom [Cole]{.underline} of
Oklahoma [said]{.underline} the [final negotiation will]{.underline}
have to [be something between the White House]{.underline} proposal
[and]{.underline} the [House]{.underline} appropriations
[bills]{.underline}.

["It depends on whether or not we really want a deal," Cole
said]{.underline}. "It can't be the Trump budget, it's not going to be
the bills we have got here."

[[Cole said the Senate should]{.mark} provide leadership]{.underline}
**[by [steer]{.mark}ing both sides to a
[compromise]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Once leaders finalize a top-line]{.mark} budget
[deal]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [[lawmakers can tackle]{.mark} dozens
of [smaller]{.mark} policy [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} in each
spending bill, any one of which could trigger a government shutdown.

#### Two-year mega deal possible -- White House and leadership [push]{.underline}, [fresh start]{.underline}, McConnell and Schumer [optimism]{.underline}, aide [leaks]{.underline} of progress, and GOP [fear of shutdown]{.underline}

**Werner 5/21** \-\-\-- Erica, Congressional reporter for *The
Washington Post*, written with Damian Paletta who has a master's in
journalism (University of Missouri) and is a reporter for the
*Washington Post*, "White House, Congressional Leaders Push for Two-Year
Budget Deal," *The Washington Post*, 2019,

[[**Top** White House]{.underline}]{.mark} officials [[and
congress]{.mark}ional [leaders **pushed**]{.mark}]{.underline} Tuesday
[[for a sweeping two-year]{.mark} budget [deal]{.mark} that would
suspend the debt ceiling and reduce the possibility of]{.underline}
another government [shutdown]{.underline} later this year, **[[a
potential bipart]{.mark}isan [breakthrough]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[following]{.underline} months of [acrimony and standoffs.]{.underline}

But despite optimistic predictions from Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.), a day of on-and-off talks at the Capitol ended
without a deal. And there was fresh evidence of the gulf to bridge
between the two parties, as Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) spoke of the need to fund domestic priorities --- something the
Trump administration has often opposed as it seeks to hold down
spending.

[The meeting]{.underline} of top administration officials and
congressional leaders of both parties [served to **kick
off**]{.underline} [what could be **months of contentious
negotiations**]{.underline} [ahead of a Sept. 30]{.underline} government
shutdown [deadline]{.underline}, which will roughly coincide with [when
Congress needs to raise the nation's borrowing limit **or risk
default**]{.underline}.

[In reaching for a two-year budget deal, [lawmakers and
admin]{.mark}istration [officials **sought to ratchet back**]{.mark}
**budget [brinkmanship]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the remainder
of]{.underline} President [Trump's term,]{.underline} [[offering]{.mark}
Congress and the White House]{.underline} [**[a fresh
start]{.underline}** [after]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump pushed the nation
into a record-long 35-day government shutdown [[this]{.mark} past
[winter]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[["I don't want to]{.mark} be too forward-leaning **in
[predict]{.mark}ing an [agreement]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [but it
seems]{.underline}]{.mark} to me, [**[without exception, everyone would
like to,]{.underline}**" [McConnell told reporters]{.underline}]{.mark}
early in the day, as he expressed hopes --- ultimately unfulfilled ---
of reaching a deal by day's end.

"A negotiated agreement with the House Democrats is the best of three
alternatives, the other two being arguing back and forth over the length
of a CR for God only knows how long, or a sequester, which hits defense
with about a \$71 billion cut at the end of the year," McConnell said,
adding that he'd delivered this message to Trump.

A CR is a continuing resolution that extends spending at existing
levels. The sequester is a set of stringent budget caps that would snap
into place early next year absent a spending deal.

[Participating in Tuesday's]{.underline} two [meetings]{.underline}
along [with McConnell and Schumer were]{.underline} House Speaker Nancy
[Pelosi]{.underline} (D-Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin
[McCarthy]{.underline} (R-Calif.), acting White House chief of staff
Mick [Mulvaney]{.underline}, Treasury Secretary Steven [Mnuchin
and]{.underline} acting budget director Russell [Vought]{.underline}.

[The second meeting adjourned without an agreement]{.underline},
**[but]{.underline}** the [[leaders plan to **meet again**]{.mark}
**soon**]{.underline}, [according to a Democratic aide]{.underline} who
was not authorized to discuss the negotiations and so spoke on the
condition of anonymity.

\[Despite national security concerns, GOP leader blocked bid to limit
China's role in U.S. transit\]

[McConnell said the focus was]{.underline} on [a two-year
agreement]{.underline} that would run through Sept. 30, 2021. [It would
include]{.underline} [suspension of the]{.underline} nation's [borrowing
limit, which must be raised]{.underline} sometime this fall **[to avoid
a financial calamity]{.underline}**.

[A deal]{.underline}, if ultimately agreed to, [would
establish]{.underline} overall [spending levels]{.underline} for the
next two years. [Such]{.underline} a development [would **reduce the
chance of a government shutdown**]{.underline} in that time frame, but
it would not eliminate the possibility since Congress would still need
to pass individual spending bills to fund each agency.

[[Schumer]{.underline} **[sounded optimistic]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[about the talk]{.underline}s when he addressed reporters earlier in the
day, though he stopped short of joining McConnell in predicting a deal
by day's end.

"Trust but verify; we'll have to wait and see, and obviously we need the
president to publicly sign off on whatever we agree to," Schumer said.
"But [I think [they realize]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[the Republican
leadership and the White House]{.underline}**, [that]{.underline} . . .
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump shut down the
government]{.underline}]{.mark} and our Republican friends went along
with that, **[[it didn't serve them]{.mark} very
[well]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [So I think]{.underline}
**[[that's]{.mark} what's [pushing]{.mark} them to a [serious
negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark}

### Will Pass\-\--A2: Budget Caps Fights

#### Support for [lifting caps]{.underline} -- Dems and Republicans were [always there]{.underline} and Trump's [softening his stance]{.underline} -- the record [belies]{.underline} anti-spending rhetoric

**Werner 5/21** \-\-\-- Erica, Congressional reporter for *The
Washington Post*, written with Damian Paletta who has a master's in
journalism (University of Missouri) and is a reporter for the
*Washington Post*, "White House, Congressional Leaders Push for Two-Year
Budget Deal," *The Washington Post*, 2019,

Budget caps put in place during the Obama administration restrict the
amount of money Congress can appropriate for military and nonmilitary
programs. [**[Many]{.underline}** [Democrats and
Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[sought to remove]{.mark} or
change]{.underline} these caps, known as [[the sequester]{.mark}, to
prevent big contractions in]{.underline} [programs]{.underline} such as
housing, transportation, environmental protection and tax collection ---
[as well as Pentagon spending]{.underline}, **[a priority for
Republicans and the White House]{.underline}**.

A few [**[months ago]{.underline}**, [White House officials
signaled]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they wanted]{.underline}]{.mark} to
keep [these [caps]{.mark}]{.underline} in place as a way to shrink the
budget, and they planned to expand defense spending through a
controversial budget maneuver. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[behind-the-scenes [negotiations led]{.mark} White House
[officials]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[to soften]{.mark} their
stance]{.underline}** in recent weeks, as [it became clear that
Democrats would not support their agenda.]{.underline}

[Republican congressional leaders, including [McConnell
and]{.mark}]{.underline} Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Richard C. [[Shelby]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ala.), [have **[made the
case]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[directly to Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} in
recent days for lifting the budget caps, [noting that not doing so would
result in huge cuts to defense]{.underline} spending.

"We're all for trying to rein in spending, but at what cost?" Shelby
said Monday evening after meeting with Trump. "And [**[I don't
think]{.underline}** [the president wants to rein in spending at the
cost of]{.underline}]{.mark} [national [security."]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[discussions are fluid]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[they [appear to target the most comprehensive]{.mark}]{.underline}
budget [[package in]{.mark} recent [years]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[[they stand in **sharp contrast**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the clash]{.underline} between Trump and Democrats [[last
year]{.underline}]{.mark} that led to the 35-day partial shutdown of
numerous federal agencies.

[After calling for major cuts]{.underline} to the budget several
**[months ago]{.underline}**, [[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline} in recent
weeks [[touted]{.mark} areas where he wants to expand
[spending]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has called for more money to build a
wall along the Mexico border, more funding for the Special Olympics and
more money for the military, among other things.

[[Republicans for years pushed]{.underline}]{.mark} aggressively [[to
shrink the budget]{.mark}, leading to big fights during]{.underline} the
[Obama]{.underline} administration. [**[But]{.underline}**
[during]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[they]{.mark} have largely [backed]{.mark} the
president's call to increase [spending]{.mark} **in order [to cut deals
with Democrats and]{.mark} dramatically [increase the Pentagon's
budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The deficit,]{.underline} which
represents the gap between spending and revenue, [has risen **each
year**]{.underline} of Trump's presidency and is projected to near \$1
trillion this year.

### Will Pass\-\--A2: December Shutdown

[In December the government partially shut down]{.underline} for 35 days
over Trump's demand for border wall funding.

["There was a reckless]{.underline} 35-day government [shutdown that
ended with]{.underline} Donald [Trump engaging in]{.underline} an
unconditional [surrender]{.underline}," House Democratic Caucus Chairman
Hakeem [[Jeffries said]{.underline}]{.mark} Tuesday. **[["We would
expect he would not go down that]{.mark} reckless [course
again."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Republicans say Democrats should not provoke a conflict by including
language in their spending bills aimed at ending all border wall
construction.

"Democrats have an opportunity to show whether they can govern or not,"
said Georgia Republican Tom Graves. "Given what I have seen in committee
and what they are proposing on the floor, they have got some challenges
ahead. They salted these bills with a lot of progressive poison pills."

**[[Long-serving members]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} the
[House Appropriations]{.underline} Committee like Democrat Rosa
[DeLauro]{.underline} of Connecticut [[predicted lawmakers]{.underline}
**[could]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[reach a
[compromise]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the policy disputes.

["[We've come to agree]{.mark}ments]{.underline} on these bills [[in
years past,"]{.mark} she said. **"So [I'm
optimistic]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

### Will Pass\-\--A2: Dems

#### Dems [won't hold up]{.underline} the deal -- they want Trump to be responsible if it fails

**Graham 5/23** \-\-\-- David A., staff writer focused on politics for
*The Atlantic*, former researcher and reporter for *Newsweek*, B.A. in

Atlantic,*
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/harder-trump-fights-impeachment-more-likely-it/590119/>

If Trump were to follow through on his threat to not do anything with
Congress until House Democrats drop their investigations, things could
get even dicier. [Within the next few months, the [debt ceiling]{.mark}
[will **need to increase** and]{.mark} the [government will **need to be
funded**. Democrats **might have**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[been tempted
to hold]{.mark} those [bills hostage]{.mark},]{.underline} just [as
Republicans have]{.underline} done [in the
past]{.underline}---[**[but]{.underline}** [now Trump has]{.underline}
[**given them an** opportunity to pass an increase]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and a spending bill [and dare the president]{.mark} to call their
bluff]{.underline}. A senior government official told CNBC that the debt
ceiling and funding are not subject to Trump's ultimatum, but the
president has demonstrated again and again that only he can speak for
himself. And if he doesn't act, and the U.S. defaults or shuts down? It
could be fodder for another article of impeachment.

### Link Turns Case\-\--Democracy

#### Link alone turns the entire case's signal

**Norris, 11** (John Norris is the Executive Director of the Sustainable
Security and Peacebuilding Initiative. 3/18,
<http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/03/rising_to_the_occasion.html>)

The question is: [What do our leaders need to do]{.underline}---to the
degree that we can influence events---[[to]{.mark} help [guide]{.mark}
the region down the path to [democracy]{.mark} and
stability]{.underline} instead of chaos? **[[First and
foremost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we need to channel the late Republican
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Ohio, who argued that [[politics should stop
at the water's edge]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [[we need
to]{.mark} **[dial down]{.mark} the [partisan sniping]{.mark}** here at
home. The president and Congress need to work together.]{.underline} If
we get it wrong in the Middle East, both parties and the American people
will reap that ill reward for years to come. Accordingly, the
administration should pull in members of Congress, former national
security officials of both parties, and other foreign policy experts on
a regular basis. These should not be briefings but discussions about how
best to navigate the incredibly tricky path before us. The
administration needs to be less insular in its decision making and
members of Congress need to avoid the cheap thrill of feeding the
24-hour news machine pithy tweets and a steady diet of second guesses.
Indeed, it is truly astounding that we may be lurching toward a
government shutdown in the middle of the most important events on the
international stage in decades. Members of both parties need to
understand full well that the American public will view our politicians
as spoiled 12-year-olds if they shutter the government at this moment.
[[Is]{.mark} partisan [gridlock]{.mark} really [the **message we
want**]{.mark} **to broadcast to protesters**]{.underline} across the
Middle East [as they risk their lives fighting for the same freedoms we
already enjoy?]{.underline} Second, our strategy needs to be clearly
communicated to the public. It is encouraging that President Barack
Obama is taking to the airwaves tonight to explain our military
involvement in Libya and our stakes across the region. The president
needs to be communicator in chief during this period and he needs to
speak honestly of the risks and rewards as we move forward. At all
costs, the administration needs to avoid the trap of thinking that its
strategy is too complex to be understood by the general public. If you
can't explain your strategy, it probably isn't a good one. By the same
token, pundits should stop the ridiculous clamoring for a clearly
identified endgame for every move the president makes. We are seeing an
entire region in upheaval. We have seen protests in 21 countries with a
population of more than 425 million people stretching across 4,800
miles. Things will be messy and uncertain for some time. Finally, and
perhaps most dauntingly, the United States needs to manage its
relationships with several longstanding Middle East allies while not
betraying democratic aspirations in these countries. Nations such as
Yemen, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia have long been key partners in the
region but we cannot let that mute our criticisms of what are highly
autocratic systems. The administration realized that reform had gained
powerful momentum in both Tunisia and Egypt and that it would be
counterproductive to be seen as defending antidemocratic regimes. The
strategic stakes are even higher in a country like Saudi Arabia. But we
need to keep the heat on some of our friends to rule far more
democratically even when it produces discomfort for all involved. The
Middle East has been hurtled through a period of incredible change
during the last three months. Millions of people have marched in the
face of armed opposition to speak out and demand their rights. [[There
can be no better time]{.mark} for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[to **demonstrate**]{.mark} **its own
[maturity]{.mark} as a democracy** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} speaking
clearly, listening to a diversity of voices, **[[cooling]{.mark} the
partisan [rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and understanding that such
historic moments are few and far between.

### Link Turns Case\-\--Economy

#### Partisan spats tank the economy -- consumer and investor confidence

<http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/hostility-among-voters-as-politics-hurt-economy/>

That is because over the summer, the [[ideological battles]{.mark} and
partisan maneuvers woven into the]{.underline} fabric of the [capital
**began to [exert]{.mark} their own [damaging effect on the
economy]{.mark}**, analysts **from Washington to Wall
Street**]{.underline} have [concluded]{.underline}. [Typically, economic
conditions frame the political debate. But in the fight]{.underline}
over raising the federal debt limit, [the political debate also
**influenced economic conditions** --- and not for the
better.]{.underline} Last week's [[unemployment]{.mark} report showing
no job growth]{.underline} in August [[provided]{.underline}]{.mark} new
[[evidence that]{.mark} the simultaneous [erosion of confidence]{.mark}
in the economy and in the government [**has harmed prospects**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} American [[workers and
businesses]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Thus in]{.underline} the post-Labor
Day chapter of [divided government, both [parties are playing
with]{.mark} this **politically [combustible material]{.mark}**: the
hostility of voters [who see them]{.mark} as not merely [failing to
solve economic problems]{.mark} but, [in fact]{.mark}, **actively
[compounding them]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The immediate legislative
question is whether rising anxiety can drive Republicans and Democrats
toward consensus solutions. So far, there is scant evidence of that
happening, as the squabble over scheduling the president's address to
Congress made clear. White House advisers say Mr. Obama, exasperated
with Republicans' refusal to cooperate, is preparing to use his speech
on Thursday to fight for an ambitious job-creation proposal costing
hundreds of billions of dollars. But Republicans, ridiculing the idea of
another stimulus, show limited interest in bargaining --- even on
tax-cut ideas they previously backed. Both of those calculations now
involve heightened risks as the 2012 elections approach. The president
is in the most conspicuous jeopardy. But Congressional Republicans are
heading into these new skirmishes with their careers on the line, too.
Eroding Confidence [[What makes]{.mark} political [attitudes
**so**]{.mark} **economically [consequential]{.mark}**]{.underline} now
[[is the role]{.mark} that consumer and business [confidence plays in
determining]{.mark} whether the stalled recovery kicks into gear --- or
slips]{.underline} back **[into [recession]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Since]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline} financial crisis, [Americans
shaken by job losses, stagnant wages and falling home values have been
borrowing]{.underline} less [and spending less. The Federal
Reserve]{.underline} Bank of New York [calculated]{.underline} this year
that this "[deleveraging" has siphoned \$480 billion]{.underline}
annually from the cash flow of American consumers. No one expects that
lost spending to return. But [**the [more pessimistic consumers]{.mark}
feel, the [less likely]{.mark} it is that [businesses]{.mark} will [see
profit in hiring]{.mark} new workers [and investing]{.mark}** in
additional production]{.underline} with the cash now filling their
coffers. Research by the Republican pollster Bill [McInturff
and]{.underline} his Democratic counterpart Peter [Hart]{.underline} for
the financial television network CNBC [showed]{.underline} that
[confidence was weak even before the final negotiations over the debt
ceiling]{.underline} last month. By June, [just 29 percent]{.underline}
of Americans [expected]{.underline} their [wages to rise]{.underline} in
the next year; [50 percent called it a bad time to invest in the stock
market; and 30 percent expected]{.underline} their [home values to
decrease]{.underline} soon, compared with just 15 percent who expected
an increase. Since then, Mr. McInturff said, the **[[infighting]{.mark}
in Washington [has eroded consumer confidence
further]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[than economic conditions]{.mark}
themselves might have [warranted]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mr. [Hart reached
the **same conclusion**]{.underline} in separate research for Citibank
[that showed Americans with diminishing expectations]{.underline} for
recovery even as their assessment of current conditions [remained
unchanged]{.underline} since January.

**[The Hesitant Goliath: [Domestic Constraints on]{.mark} American
[Unipolarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** Since 9/11, [scholarship on
Unipolarity sparkled an extensive debate on the consequences of American
global dominance]{.underline}. [Scholars focused]{.underline}, in
particular, [on]{.underline} two sets of assumed issues: [changes in the
behavior of the unipolar state]{.underline} and changes in the nature of
the international system. [The former deals with]{.underline}
international incentives and **[limitations to American foreign
policy]{.underline}**, the latter with the duration and feasibility of
the unipolar phase of International Relations. The American expansionism
under the George W. Bush administration is often characterized as the
main expression of the advantages of Unipolarity. On the other hand,
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ignited unprecedented setbacks to American
power, as they curbed America's international legitimacy and raised
questions about counterbalancing movements from secondary states in the
international arena. [This paper examines **constraints on American
primacy** and argues that [domestic constraints, **more than
international**]{.mark} **ones, can [limit America]{.mark}n Foreign
policy** throughout the unipolar era. [Through an analysis
of]{.mark}]{.underline} George W. [[Bush's **and**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Barack [[Obama's]{.mark} main foreign policy [endeavors]{.mark}, this
paper will examine]{.underline} two main hypotheses. First,
[that]{.underline} unrivaled primacy makes it harder for Presidents to
frame clear external threats, and thus makes the public less attentive
and more incoherent towards foreign policy issues. Second, [the
[heightened **polarization**]{.mark} **of American politics
[blurs]{.mark} the [separation between domestic and foreign policy,
and]{.mark} tends to [make the latter]{.mark} as [hesitant]{.mark} and
tentative as the former**. The paper concludes that [recent
developments]{.mark} in domestic politics]{.underline}, alongside with
the absence of new territorial threats, [[make]{.mark} American
[primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} less dependent on material capabilities
and **[[more subject to]{.mark} national
[turbulence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[After Obama was inaugurated]{.underline} as president in 2009, House
[[Democrats unleashed a formidable agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}
consisting of a two-month blitz to pass a \$787 billion stimulus bill,
which passed in February 2009; four months of pushing the cap-and-trade
climate bill, which passed in June 2009; and, finally, an eight-month
slog to pass a financial regulation reform bill in December 2009 and a
health care reform bill in February 2010. [[But only the stimulus,

One key factor is that [arms [sales to Taiwan]{.mark} have [enjoyed
**broad support** in]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. [[Congress]{.mark}.
Over the years]{.underline}, several pieces of [legislation]{.underline}
have been [proposed in [**both houses** urg]{.mark}]{.underline}ing
[greater U.S. support of Taiwan, including through the sale of
[F-16]{.mark}]{.underline}C/D[[s,]{.mark}
[sub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine[[s and]{.mark} other [advanced
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. In November 2011, Senator John

confirmation of]{.underline} Mark [[Lippert]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[assistant secretary of defense. [Cornyn released]{.mark} his
hold]{.underline} six months later, [[after]{.mark} the White House
wrote a letter]{.underline} to Cornyn [agreeing to seriously consider
the [sale]{.mark} of F-16C/Ds [to Taiwan]{.mark} and address Taiwan's
fighter gap. A **highly [influential]{.mark}** Taiwan
[lobby]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington, [along [with]{.mark} the
[economic benefits to]{.mark} the U.S. [defense]{.mark} sector
associated with arms sales to Taiwan, have]{.underline} also
[[provided]{.mark} an [impetus]{.mark} for U.S. arms sales]{.underline}.

Though China's opposition to the [arms deal was]{.underline} not
surprising, the proposed package was also [subject to an unusual level
of domestic scrutiny within the U.S., and [an active debate emerged on
whether or not the U.S. should continue arms sales to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} in the face of strong opposition by the
People's Republic of China (PRC). On one side of the debate, a number of
scholars came out and argued that the U.S ought to stop, or seriously
reduce, arms sales to Taiwan in order to eliminate a significant
irritant in the United States' increasingly important relationship with
China.4 On the other side, [[a number of lawmakers---like]{.mark}
[Senator]{.mark}s]{.underline} John [[Cornyn, a
Republican]{.underline}]{.mark} from Texas, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline}
Robert [[Menendez, a Democrat]{.underline}]{.mark} from New
Jersey---[[argued]{.mark} that the package proposed by the Obama
administration was not actually significant enough.]{.underline}5 [They
maintained [that not selling the more advanced]{.mark}]{.underline} F-16
C/D [[fighters]{.mark} to Taiwan [was \"a slap in the face to a strong
ally]{.mark}]{.underline} and longtime friend.\"6 Backing their
position, a number of analysts expressed concern that Taiwan's air force
would be unable to match China's without significant modernization---a
concern that would be partly addressed by the sale of the more advanced
fighters.7 The final package put forth by Obama in September of 2011
fell somewhere in between these two extremes. The administration agreed
to sell Taiwan a package of arms but declined to include a full array of
advanced weaponry. Cont... In addition to changing the official
relationship between the U.S., Taiwan, and China, the TRA has also
become the modern foundation for U.S. arms transfers to Taiwan.
Specifically, the TRA requires the U.S. to "make available to Taiwan
such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be
necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capacity.\"10 It is significant to note that the TRA does not actually
obligate the United States to intervene in Taiwan if the PRC invades,
unlike the mutual defense treaty that preceded it. The TRA does,
however, require the executive branch to consult with Congress in the
event that Taiwan's security is jeopardized. [American
[senators]{.mark}, many of whom **[strongly support]{.mark}ed
[Taiwan]{.mark},**]{.underline} [believed]{.underline} that [this
feature would prevent the administration from acting unilaterally to
compromise Taiwanese security]{.underline} in the face of Chinese
pressure.11 However, because of disagreements between members of
Congress, the TRA leaves the executive branch of government in charge of
determining what types of arms are to be sold, how much should be sold,
and when arms will be sold.12 Thus, Congress only has the power to
accept or reject arms deals---it cannot modify them. This remains the
case to this very day.

I want to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the
trip went so well. I'll warn you: This is a somewhat taboo subject for
progressive foreign-policy types. The subject, friends, is arms sales.
[Progressives don't like [arms sales]{.mark} very much,]{.underline}
**[but they need to pay attention to them]{.underline}**, because
[they're one]{.underline} **[big way]{.underline}** [Republicans
[are]{.mark} **fighting for---and [winning]{.mark}**[---the votes of
working-class Americans]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[who]{.mark} have
[traditionally voted for Democrats.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

While the president was in Saudi Arabia, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [announced \$110 billion in arms sales to Saudi
Arabia---with an additional \$240 billion committed over a 10-year
period]{.underline}. If you've ever worked in government, you know this
is what is called a "deliverable," the clunky management-consultantese
term for a tangible outcome of a visit or meeting. When Donald Trump is
asked to justify his trip to Saudi Arabia, he'll cite that \$110 billion
in arms sales.

There are a few interesting things about these sales. The first is that
many of these sales were already in the works. The [Obama]{.underline}
administration [spent eight years quietly selling a lot of arms to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}: When President Obama left office, for example, the
United States still had \$100 billion in the foreign military sales
pipeline with Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what was previously
the largest arms sale in U.S. history with the Kingdom---a \$29 billion
deal to sell F-15s to the Saudis.

[Obama]{.underline}-era [sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping with
sales to other Gulf states]{.underline}: Both [Qatar and
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[A]{.underline}**rab
**[E]{.underline}**mirates [bought a tremendous amount of U.S. arms
between 2009 and 2017]{.underline}. Qatar bought more U.S. arms than any
other state in 2014 and, in the waning days of the Obama administration,
announced that it would buy nearly \$4 billion in Boeing-made F-15s in
addition to \$19 billion in commercial aircraft, also from Boeing.

[Overall]{.underline}, the Arab Gulf [states went on a **spending
spree**]{.underline} [during the Obama years]{.underline}, and most of
the money was spent on American arms.

[So why didn't you hear a lot about this from Democratic
politicians]{.underline} during the 2016 election season[?]{.underline}
There are two main reasons---one strategic and one moral.

Strategically, not everyone is convinced that arming the Arab Gulf
states to the teeth is a wise idea. Some worry that these arms might
someday endanger Israel's security, while others worry the Arab Gulf
states might be encouraged to use their new toys on disastrous military
interventions against Iran or Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen.

The quick and unsatisfying answer to these concerns is the global
market. The Arab Gulf states have money, and that money will buy the
weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are not for sale, fine: French,
Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if you don't believe me, look at
the way in which Gulf states---frustrated by U.S. export controls on
drone technology---are turning to the Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the
Gulf states, by contrast, further ties them to U.S. interests by
deepening cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. military and
its Gulf partners. One of the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters
to partially replace its French-made fleet, for example, was because
they discovered how difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft
to fly with the U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and
Syria.

Arms sales also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus the
amount of money U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of
other priorities like, say, the State Department, school lunches, or
housing subsidies. Here's one example: Because the United States is
buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of its "fourth
generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over Iraq and
Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense will likely
need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the coming
years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and F-16s to
Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon. That's a
good thing---at least financially.

[Morally]{.underline}, though, [[many progressives]{.underline}]{.mark}
just **[[grow ill at the idea of selling weapons
abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Senator Chris [Murphy]{.underline}, for
example---[one of the more eloquent and consistent critics of U.S. arms
sales]{.underline} in the Senate, even though his own state has a very
robust defense industrial base---[sees nothing admirable
about]{.underline} the idea of [selling weapons]{.underline} to the
Saudis that might be used in Yemen. **[Other progressives
agree]{.underline}**: Yes, they argue, we understand the demand of the
market will be met by someone, but do we have to be complicit in
providing the supply? In other countries, progressives have even taken
to the courts in an effort to halt sales.

I have a lot of respect for these progressives and their values. I spent
too much time in Sunday School as a kid to not feel a little uneasy
about the business of selling weapons. And [the [angst]{.mark} many
progressives feel about U.S. arms sales [has been enough **to keep many
Democrats from talking up**]{.mark} **their [successes]{.mark} in
[helping]{.mark} U.S. [industry]{.mark} abroad**. [I wonder,]{.mark}
though, [if there isn't a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[real political
cost]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to not doing so]{.underline}.

[Boeing employs **157,000**]{.underline} people---almost all of them in
the United States. [14,500]{.underline} people [work]{.underline} in
Boeing's facilities [in Missouri]{.underline}, where the F-15 and F-18
are made, where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection next year,
and [where]{.underline} Donald [Trump **trounced**]{.underline} Hillary
[Clinton 56 to 38]{.underline} percent in 2016. ([Those 14,500 people do
not include the]{.underline} **[many thousands of other
Americans]{.underline}** [who make parts]{.underline} for the F-15 and
F-18 elsewhere in America.)

[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, meanwhile, a huge winner in the recent
arms deal with Saudi Arabia (despite ace businessman Jared Kushner
negotiating the price down on behalf of the Saudis), [employs an
**additional 97,000**]{.underline} workers---again, most of them in the
United States. And [Raytheon]{.underline}, another big winner last week,
[employs]{.underline} another **[60,000]{.underline}** or so Americans.

Donald [[Trump]{.mark} obviously [has n]{.mark}o moral [qualms about
selling weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} to our partners and allies
[abroad]{.underline}. And [**[so while Democrats leave points on the
board]{.mark} with working-class voters** by not talking about
how]{.underline} much [Democrats]{.underline} do to [support U.S.
industry, **[Republicans swoop in to take credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[with assembly line workers [for even]{.mark} those [things]{.mark} that
[Obama approved]{.mark} and set in motion]{.underline}.

[[The way]{.underline}]{.mark} in which [[Trump brags about]{.mark} U.S.
[arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
in [[keeping with]{.underline}]{.mark} the strain of [economic
[mercantilism]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[that ran through his populist
campaign]{.mark} message]{.underline}**. [[That message]{.underline}
**[worked]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**with voters [throughout the Midwest,
helping]{.mark} to [cost Clinton the election]{.mark}**. So while
progressives might have moral qualms about companies that sell
weapons]{.underline}, the roughly **[[1.2 million]{.mark} American
voters]{.underline}** [who work [in the]{.mark}]{.underline} aerospace
and defense [[sector]{.underline}]{.mark}---together [[with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} roughly **[[3.2 million]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Americans [who support the sector
[indirectly]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[see little wrong with]{.mark} the
[sales]{.mark} that help ensure their livelihoods]{.underline} and
provide a future for their children.

[This might be an]{.underline}other [area in which [progressive
elites]{.mark}]{.underline}---who have the kinds of education and skills
that don't require them to seek work on the assembly
line---**[[are]{.mark} simply [out of touch]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[with]{.mark} the [voters **they need to win**]{.mark} **back control
of the Congress and state assemblies, never mind [the
presidency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And politics aside, surely even the
moral calculus of arms sales gets more complicated when you think about
the millions of American mouths that are fed by mothers and fathers who
work in the aerospace and defense sector.

Donald [Trump]{.underline}, for his part, [is speaking to those voters.
And even as [progressives]{.mark} fret about U.S. arms sales, they
[should]{.mark} also [fret]{.mark} about what it will mean for the rest
of their agenda **[when Republicans claim credit for protecting]{.mark}
some of the last good [assembly-line jobs]{.mark} in
America.**]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Fights\-\--Arms Sales\-\--Public\-\--A2: No Effect

#### Gilens and Page are [clowns]{.underline}

**Matthews 16** \-\-\-- Dylan, Senior Correspondent for *Vox*, "Remember
that Study Saying America is an Oligarchy? 3 Rebuttals Say It\'s Wrong,"
5/9, https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study

All of these stories were about a study by political scientists Martin
[[Gilens]{.underline}]{.mark} of Princeton [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
Benjamin [[Page]{.underline}]{.mark} of Northwestern, modestly titled,
\"Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and
Average Citizens.\"

Their [conclusion [was explosive]{.mark}]{.underline}: \"Economic elites
and organized groups representing business interests have substantial
independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens
and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent
influence.\"

The paper soon went viral as proof that America is an \"oligarchy\" (the
press\'s term, not theirs) where the views of the rich control what
happens and the views of the middle class are ignored. The authors were
even on The Daily Show --- not bad for academics without so much as a
book to promote:

[[There\'s only one problem: Research]{.mark} published
[since]{.mark}]{.underline} then has [[raised]{.underline} **[serious
questions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [about this paper]{.underline},
**[both]{.underline}** [its finding and its analysis]{.underline}. This
is, of course, how normal science works; some [academics put a finding
out there, and]{.underline} their [peers]{.underline} **[pick it
apart.]{.underline}**

But [the study has become a frequently invoked piece of evidence in
debates about]{.underline} money in [politics, and]{.underline} the
public and political [debate]{.underline} **[has not kept up with the
scholarly one]{.underline}**. And the latest scholarly critiques suggest
that [while the rich certainly have more political
influence]{.underline} than the middle class, ordinary
[[Americans]{.underline} **[still]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[win]{.mark}
a substantial share of the time, [even when the affluent oppose
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[America is]{.underline} an imperfect democracy, in other words --- but
it\'s **[hardly an oligarchy]{.underline}**.

[When the rich and middle class disagree, each wins]{.underline} about
half the time

Since its initial release, the [[Gilens/Page]{.mark} paper\'s findings
[have]{.mark} been targeted in **[three separate
debunkings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Cornell professor Peter
[Enns]{.underline}, recent Princeton PhD graduate Omar [Bashir, and a
team of]{.underline} three [researchers]{.underline} --- UT Austin grad
student J. Alexander Branham, University of Michigan professor Stuart
Soroka, and UT professor Christopher Wlezien --- [have all taken a look
at Gilens and Page\'s underlying [data and]{.mark} found that their
[analysis **doesn\'t hold up**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Gilens and Page used a database of 1,779 policy issues --- which
included data on the opinions of median-income Americans, the rich,
business interests, and non-business interest groups like unions or the
National Rifle Association --- to determine whose opinions correlated
most closely with actual government policy.

But the [researchers critiquing the paper found]{.underline} that
[[middle-income]{.underline}]{.mark} Americans [[and rich
Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} actually **[[agree]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on an **overwhelming majority**]{.underline} [of topics]{.underline}.
Out of the 1,779 bills in the Gilens/Page data set, majorities of the
rich and middle class agree on 1,594; there are 616 bills both groups
oppose and 978 bills both groups favor. That means the groups agree on
89.6 percent of bills.

That leaves only 185 bills on which the rich and the middle class
disagree, and even there the disagreements are small. On average, the
groups\' opinion gaps on the 185 bills is 10.9 percentage points; so,
say, 45 percent of the middle class might support a bill while 55.9
percent of the rich support it.

[Bashir and Branham/Soroka/Wlezien find]{.underline} that
[on]{.underline} these 185 [bills, the rich got their preferred outcome
53 percent of the time and the middle class]{.underline} got what they
wanted [47 percent of the time]{.underline}. The [[difference]{.mark}
between the two [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not statistically
significant]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And there are some funny examples in
the list of middle-class victories. For instance, the middle class got
what they wanted on public financing of elections: in all three 1990s
surveys included in the Gilens data, they opposed it, while the rich
favor it. That matches up with more recent research showing that wealthy
people are more supportive of public election funding.

So [**it\'s hard to say definitively**, based on this data, that the
rich are getting what they want more than the middle class. And it\'s
hard to claim, as Gilens and Page do, that \"ordinary citizens get what
they want from government only when they happen to agree with
elites]{.underline} or interest groups that are really calling the
shots.\" [Even when they disagree with elites, ordinary citizens get
what they want about half the time.]{.underline}

Branham, Soroka, and Wlezien also look at which specific issues spur
disagreement: Do they fall down on ideological lines? Sort of, but not
dramatically so. The authors find that the middle class got 26 liberal
policy wins (either a bill they supported passing or one they opposed
getting blocked), 20 conservative wins, and 29 ideologically neutral
wins. The rich got 28 liberal wins, 26 conservative wins, and 37 neutral
wins. The rich\'s wins are slightly more conservative on average, but
not hugely so.

Okay, but [[maybe]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[conservative
wins]{.underline}]{.mark} for the rich [were all on issues that
[mattered most]{.mark}]{.underline} to the rich. Maybe the middle class
wins occasionally on social issues, but the rich succeed in preventing
redistribution and other economic policies they don\'t like.

**[Again]{.underline}**, **[[no]{.mark}t really.]{.underline}** The
researchers found the rich's win rate for economic issues where there\'s
disagreement is 57.1 percent, compared with 51.1 percent for social
issues. [[There\'s a difference, but **not a robust**]{.mark}
**[one]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"[The win rates for the two issue types
are not statistically different from one another,\" Branham, Soroka, and
Wlezien conclude]{.underline}.

21st Century Symposium: Article: Presidential Unilateralism and
Political Polarization: Why Today\'s Congress Lacks The Will And The Way
To Stop Presidential Initiatives" 45 Willamette L. Rev. 395 Spring)

Let me shift focus to the question that lies at the heart of this essay,
namely, why [party [polarization]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} today\'s [[Congress
from]{.underline}]{.mark} standing up for institutional prerogatives and
[[checking the executive]{.underline}]{.mark} branch. Please note that I
am not taking a position on whether President Bush\'s claims of
presidential power were well founded. My concern is simply whether
today\'s Congress is capable of embracing the types of legislative
reforms that were enacted by the Watergate-era Congress.¶ \[\*407\] My
analysis will proceed in two parts. First, I will discuss party
polarization and how it has contributed to the resurgence of
presidential unilateralism. n37 Second, I will explain why
[the]{.underline} [modern]{.underline} day [[Congress has neither the
wil]{.mark}l n[or]{.mark} the [way to check]{.mark} presidential
[unilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, Congress\'s
uninterest in asserting institutional prerogatives to check the George
W. Bush administration highlights dramatic differences between the
modern day Congress and the Watergate-era Congress.¶ With regard to
party polarization, it is quite clear that the days of the Rockefeller
Republican and Southern Democrat are behind us. Measures of ideology
reveal that all or nearly all Republicans are more conservative than the
most conservative Democrat. n38 Correspondingly, there is no meaningful
ideological range within either the Democratic or Republican Party. For
example, with the demise of Rockefeller Republicans and Southern
Democrats, the gap between Northern and Southern members of the two
parties had largely disappeared by the 1990s. n39 Indeed, as Figure 1 on
the following page makes abundantly clear, party polarization is more
extreme today than ever before.¶ \[\*408\] ¶ Figure 1. n40¶ Party

\[SEE FIGURE 1 IN ORIGINAL\]¶ This pattern will likely continue. With
only one-half of eligible voters voting, there is greater emphasis on
mobilizing the more partisan base. More than that, in the House of
Representatives, computer-driven redistricting has resulted in the
drawing of lines that essentially guarantee that Democrats will win
certain districts and Republicans other districts. n41 And while there
are some toss-up districts, the vast majority of districts are
noncompetitive. What this means is that - in the House - the party
primary often controls who will win the election and, as such,
candidates have incentive to appeal to the partisans who vote in the
primaries (and not the median voter in the general elections). n42¶ The
consequences of party polarization are profound. Party leaders,
especially in the House, have capitalized on the fact that lawmakers are
more apt to see themselves as members of a party, not as independent
power brokers (willing to cross party lines in order to \[\*409\] pursue
favored policies). Correspondingly, party leaders are increasingly
concerned with \"message politics,\" that is, with using the legislative
process to make a symbolic statement to voters and other constituents.
n43 Rather than allow decentralized committees to define Congress\'s
agenda, Democrats and Republicans alike see the lawmaking process as a
way to stand behind a unified party message and, in this way, to
distinguish their party from the other. Relatedly, [rather than seek
middle ground bipartisan solutions]{.underline}[, [each party looks to
gain political advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} [from the
other.¶]{.underline} The Clinton impeachment is a classic example of
this phenomenon. Unlike the Nixon impeachment (where members of Congress
\"rose above partisanship\"), \"it is harder to identify such actors\"
in President Clinton\'s case. n44 \"The virtual party-line votes in the
House and the Senate reinforce public perception of the intense
partisanship underlying the proceedings.\" n45¶ Party
[polarization]{.underline} likewise [contributes to]{.underline}
partisanship in how Congress conducts hearings as well as [Congress\'s
willingness to hold the executive accountable]{.underline} through
oversight. n46 Today\'s lawmakers do not need hearings to sort out their
views. With increasing polarization and appeals to the party base,
[[members are]{.underline}]{.mark} both [more [ideological and less
trusting]{.mark} of the other party]{.underline}. Correspondingly,
majority and minority staff rarely work together - instead, [each side
will call witnesses who back up the predetermined views of the party
that has enlisted them]{.underline}. n47¶ When it comes to oversight,
party identity is also key. When the President and Congress are from the
same party, the majority in Congress will not use oversight to hold the
President to task. And when the government is divided, Congress will
make oversight a top priority. This pattern held true for both the
Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies. When the President\'s party in
Congress was in the majority, the opposition party bitterly complained
of the majority\'s \"lacking backbone\" and \"abdicating\" its
responsibility for \[\*410\] oversight. n48 But when the President\'s
opponents took over Congress, oversight became a top priority - with the
President\'s party accusing the majority of using its powers \"to harass
and intimidate.\" n49¶ Finally and, for my purposes, most significant,
party polarization contributes to the rise of presidential
unilateralism. [When the Congress is polarized]{.underline}, [[members
of the President\'s party are not likely to]{.mark} break ranks and vote
to [limit presidential initiatives.]{.mark}]{.underline} When government
is unified, this means that **[[no bill will get through]{.mark}
Congress [to limit presidential initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
Congress is divided, [[members of the President\'s party will resist any
opposition]{.mark} party efforts [to repudiate the
President]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} More than that, since divided
government is increasingly common (thirty of the past forty years), [it
is also increasingly difficult for Congress to enact significant
legislation]{.underline}. As such, Presidents have even more incentive
to act unilaterally - since they cannot get Congress to enact their
legislative agenda. n50

#### Congressional aversion to action causes fights -- polarization

**Devins 9** (Neal, Goodrich Professor of Law and Professor of
Government (College of William and Mary), "Presidential Power in The
21st Century Symposium: Article: Presidential Unilateralism and
Political Polarization: Why Today\'s Congress Lacks The Will And The Way
To Stop Presidential Initiatives" 45 Willamette L. Rev. 395 Spring)

The practices of the current Congress are to be expected. Members of
[[Congress hardly ever gain]{.mark} personal]{.underline} [[political
advantage by embracing]{.underline}]{.mark} structural [[checks of
president]{.mark}ial power]{.underline}. Just as Congress has incentive
to delegate to the executive ([rather than absorb the costs of making a
decision]{.underline} that disfavors identifiable participants in the
political process), Congress is more interested in responding to
executive branch initiatives than in foreclosing particular types of
initiatives. n63 Sometimes, as was true with the 1974 budget act,
structural reforms serve the personal interests of members of Congress.
In that case, members had a personal political interest to protect their
authority to enact budget bills that reward constituents. Most of the
time, however, [[Congress would rather respond]{.underline}]{.mark} to
presidential initiatives [[than place]{.underline} [restrictions
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [presidential [authority]{.mark}]{.underline} -
restrictions that shift the locus of decision making power to Congress
(so that Congress bears the cost of decision). For this very reason,
lawmakers rarely advance their personal political interests by
structurally constraining the President in ways that shift the decision
back to Congress. Indeed, the War Powers Resolution - while ostensibly
placing limits on the President - gave the President significant
authority to launch unilateral military strikes. Congress\'s assent was
not required until 60 days after the President\'s initiative \[\*415\]
(and only if the President triggered the clock by making a formal report
to Congress). n64 As such, Congress - while insisting it had a role to
play - was content to play a reactive role. Long story short: Not only
does [**political [polarization stand as a roadblock]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the modern Congress [standing up for]{.mark} its
[institutional prerogatives]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [lawmakers
typically]{.underline} [do not gain personal political advantage by
placing structural limits on presidential power.]{.underline}

Perhaps the first point to make about the three sets of commitments that
constitute the policy architecture governing this issue is their
clear-cut hierarchy. The TRA is U.S. law. It obliges the U.S. government
to under - take certain actions with respect to Taiwan. In this sense,
it is, from the U.S. standpoint, the most binding and immutable piece of
the U.S. policy architecture governing this issue. Moreover, [as
[suggested by]{.mark} the legislation's **substantial** [margin of
victory]{.mark}]{.underline} in the U.S. Con - gress in 1979 59 , [[it
has **enormous**]{.mark} **political [support]{.mark}** in Congress, as
well as within the executive branch]{.underline} of the U.S. government.
While, as noted earlier, [there have been occasional [efforts to
modify]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [policy toward Taiwan]{.underline}, and
[specifically on]{.underline} the issue of [arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline} to Taiwan, [**virtually [all]{.mark}** such
efforts [have been]{.mark} in the direction of [ratcheting up]{.mark}
the U.S. [commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} to Taiwan. 60 [In an era in
which examples of]{.underline} true [[bipartisanship]{.mark} in Congress
or between the]{.underline} U.S. government's [executive and legislative
branches [are]{.mark} relatively [rare,]{.mark} **the [TRA]{.mark}
continues to [enjoy not only bipartisan support,
but]{.mark}**]{.underline} indeed[, **[overwhelming
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, from both a legal and a political
standpoint, the TRA is, and will indefinitely continue to be, the
central pillar of U.S. policy regarding the sale of arms to Taiwan.

American [Presidents are vested with certain structural
powers]{.underline}, such as those powers granted by the Constitution or
the particular political distribution of power across the executive and
legislative branches. [But presidents have varying degrees of success in
exercising their political will]{.underline} in the governing process.
Because structural factors are relatively stable, [this variance
can]{.underline} reasonably [be]{.underline} [ascribed to the
oscillating levels of authority they receive]{.underline} from the
public that affects the degree of influence they are able to exercise.
These sources of authority include individual factors, such as personal
skill, temperament, and expertise. But [[authority]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a reflection of]{.mark} the
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the policies the president expects
to implement.]{.underline} Beyond the powers granted by the Constitution
and U.S. law, presidents rely on resources that lie at the confluence of
historical context and personal prestige to have his way with Congress
and with the public. **[[The perception of legitimacy is the active
ingredient that converts]{.mark}]{.underline}** historical circumstances
and **[[prestige into political leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his
book The President as Leader, Erwin Hargove inspects the combined impact
of political skill and moral direction on leadership effectiveness. "A
full and complete political 32 leader must combine elements of craft and
moral purpose in his character as well as his work... moral character is
itself a skill and thus a component of effective leadership." 48 Richard
Neustadt's argument that the modern president must understand and
closely guard his ability to exert influence and Stephen Skowronek's
work on authority and compliance based on appropriate command present
impressive evidence of how presidential leadership builds on sources of
non-material power. 49 These works describe a dynamic of effective
leadership that is enhanced when presidents contend with normative
expectations in charting policy directions. In his path-breaking work on
the deficiencies of the literature on presidential power, Richard
Neustadt suggested that formal powers as established by the Constitution
are not consistent with the personal power required to exert influence
over the government bureaucracy. [To have his way,
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[president had to conserve]{.mark} his
power]{.underline} [[resources and **expend them strategically** to
advance his agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Prestige," a source of
presidential influence, moves in accordance with the public's
perceptions. 50 Stephen Skowronek does not fully accept Neustadt's
thesis of presidential weakness, but he does suggest that the
institutional structure of time and the corresponding modulation of
authority coupled with shifting legitimacy norms constrain presidential
effectiveness. He posits that certain historical patterns provide
greater or lesser influence to individual presidents and that for the
president to enjoy significant presidential leverage, the public must
grant the authority to repudiate the old order in his exercise of power.
51 ¶ Skowronek suggests that compliance based on authority results from
public perceptions that the president's request is "appropriate" in a
given context. "A president's authority hinges on the warrants that can
be drawn from the moment at hand to justify action and secure the
legitimacy of the changes affected." 52 He suggests that in order to
exercise power, a president must be granted the authority to challenge
conventional practice. Where Neustadt tracks the influence of public
support on presidential influence, Skowronek offers a contextual
variable that influences presidential authority---[certain]{.underline}
[configurations of events grant the president latitude in which to
operate]{.underline}. Examples include critical junctures such as the
onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s granting Franklin
Roosevelt authority to embark on the New Deal policies upon entering
office in 1933; oil shocks and the hostage crisis in Iran late in
President Carter's administration gave a substantial lift to President
Reagan's level of authority with the public; and the late-term recession
under George H.W. Bush gave some maneuver room to President Clinton to
contend with international trade and broader economic issues as he took
office in 1993. It is one reason, he suggests, that strong presidents
have historically followed weak ones. In the twentieth century, the
pairs of McKinley-Theodore Roosevelt, Hoover-Franklin Roosevelt, and
Carter-Reagan all follow this trend. This same logic adds credence to
the argument that September 11 sufficiently shocked the American public
that it granted President Bush the authority to radically depart from
the traditional norms guiding U.S. foreign policy. The public granted
authority to a president in accordance with the legitimacy of each
president's claim. [The [ability of the president to exert
influence]{.mark}]{.underline} [[varies]{.underline} [in accordance
with]{.underline}]{.mark} such non- structural factors as **[political
[overreach]{.mark}]{.underline}**, legislative success, **[[and
bargaining failures]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By most accounts, President
Bush's political capital is now at a nadir in his Administration---as
measured by low poll numbers and a recent dearth of examples of
effective exercise of power---yet the structural factors are unchanged,
including his Constitutional authority.¶ Authority is affected by
interjection of the intervening variable of historical context and¶
perceptions of legitimacy. Increasing fatalities and instability in
Iraq, limited progress in¶ advancing the Administration's goal of social
security privatization, a perceived inept federal response to Hurricane
Katrina, and a range of Republican ethical and legal difficulties all
eroded¶ President Bush's ability to pursue his preferred policies and
resulted in the end of the Republican¶ majorities in both chambers of
Congress. Furthermore, as President Bush's political capital¶ erodes,
his ability to hold together the disparate parts of the Republican Party
under his¶ leadership correspondingly declines. The current intra-party
debate between Republican¶ members of Congress also reflects the
President's inability to maintain party discipline over the¶ Iraq war
strategy.¶ [[Declining]{.underline}]{.mark} political [[authority
encourages defection]{.underline}]{.mark}. [American political
analyst]{.underline} Norman [Ornstein writes of]{.underline} [the
domestic context,]{.underline} In a system [[where a President has
limited]{.mark} formal [power]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[perception
matters]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The reputation for
success---the belief by other political actors that even when he looks
down, a president will find a way to pull out a [[victory---is the most
valuable resource a]{.mark} chief [executive can
have]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conversely, [the]{.underline} widespread
[[belief]{.mark} that [the Oval Office]{.mark} occupant [is on the
defensive]{.mark}]{.underline}, [on the wane]{.underline} or without the
ability to win under adversity [[can lead to
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}, as individual lawmakers calculate who
will be on the winning side and negotiate accordingly. In simple terms,
winners win and **[[losers lose more often than
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Failure begets failure]{.underline}. In
short, [[a president experiencing declining]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts
of [**[p]{.mark}**olitical]{.underline}
[**[c]{.mark}**apital]{.underline} [[has]{.underline} [diminished
capacity to advance his goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result,
[political allies perceive a decreasing benefit in publicly tying
themselves to the president]{.underline}, and an increasing benefit in
allying with rising centers of authority. A president's incapacity and
his record of success are interlocked and reinforce each other.
[[Incapacity leads to]{.mark} political
[failure]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[which reinforces]{.mark}
perceptions of [incapacity. This]{.mark} feedback loop [accelerates
decay]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[in leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}
[capacity]{.underline} [[and defection by key
allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} The central point of this review of the
presidential literature is that the sources of presidential
influence---and thus their prospects for enjoying success in pursuing
preferred foreign policies---go beyond the structural factors imbued by
the Constitution. [Presidential authority is affected by]{.underline}
ideational resources in the form of public [perceptions of
legitimacy]{.underline}. The public offers and rescinds its support in
accordance with normative trends and historical patterns, non-material
sources of power that affects the character of U.S. policy, foreign and
domestic.

### Link\-\--Losers Lose\-\--A2: Theory Wrong

#### Losers Lose is true and GOP is Key

Public Policy at Georgetown University (Stan, "The 3 Things That Could
Stop Trump Cold Next Year (And It\'s Not The Democrats)," 11/16,

Less than a full week after Donald Trump was elected president,
Republican Senator [Rand [Paul]{.mark}]{.underline} (KY) [publicly
announced that several of the senior people being considered for cabinet
positions in the new administration were unacceptable]{.underline} and
that he will vote against them if they are nominated.

Senator [Paul]{.underline}\'s statement may be sincere; he [actually
might not approve of the rumored cabinet choices. Or he [may be
**letting**]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
team [**[know early on that his vote shouldn\'t be considered
automatic]{.mark} and that [he\'s going to want something in
return]{.mark} for it**.]{.underline} After all, **[[that\'s how
Washington]{.mark} often \-- or perhaps typically [\--
works]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

But it\'s also a reminder that, for all the talk about Trump being able
to get things done easy and quickly because the GOP will control the
White House and Congress, **[[the biggest and longest lasting threat
to]{.mark} his ability to [accomplish anything will come from other
Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Here are the top 3 Republican-caused legislative challenges the Trump
agenda could face in the next Congress.

Any 3 Republican Senators

[[With a]{.mark} likely [52-48 Senate majority]{.mark}]{.underline}
after the run-off in Louisiana is settled, **[[Trump will only be able
to lose 2 votes on any legislative initiative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At
50-50, Vice President Mike Pence, in his role as president of the
Senate, will vote to break a tie and give the president a victory.

[But as Paul\'s announcement indicates, **[Republican unity won\'t be
automatic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although it\'s not always likely to be
the same 3 GOP senators on every issue, it\'s not hard to believe that
there will always be a small group of Republicans willing to oppose the
Trump White House on the most controversial votes . **[[It\'s even
easier to imagine GOP opposition will develop if]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration is mired in
controversy, **[[appears not to be in control, loses some early fights
with Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or gets stuck in a foreign policy
or military problem.]{.underline}

<http://fortune.com/2017/01/12/trumps-known-unknowns/>

As the newsletter's title suggests, the form these
[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark} take [[will **depend in significant
measure** on]{.underline}]{.mark} something we don't yet know:
**[[How]{.mark}]{.underline}** Donald **[[Trump will
lead]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He remains largely undefined on all but the
most generalized policy preferences. Will he fill them in himself --- or
defer to the advisors he's still busy hiring? How far will that team,
already heavy on Wall Street experience, go to sand the edges off the
populist platform that delivered Trump to power? And once the White
House decides what it wants, [[will it]{.underline}]{.mark} seek to
[[drive the agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} on Capitol Hill, [[or **hand the
wheel over**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Congressional Republicans, [whose
priorities diverge on some key questions]{.underline}? We'll begin to
get some answers imminently, as this much is clear: [[Trump is itching
to rack up early wins]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time, the ethics
questions shadowing the president-elect loom as a major distraction with
the potential to kneecap his agenda. This newsletter will not be a daily
digest of, say, stories relating to ongoing concerns about his business
holdings or so far unsubstantiated speculation about his Russian ties.
But both are dominating this morning's headlines. Trump faced an
assembled press corps Wednesday for the first time since July, trashing
reports that intelligence officials briefed him and President Obama on
allegations that Russian operatives compiled personal and financial
material to blackmail him. And in the same news conference, he outlined
plans to hand control of the Trump Organization to his sons while
maintaining his stake --- an arrangement ethics experts denounced,
including the director of the Office of Government Ethics, who called it
"wholly inadequate." (Trump also sent pharma stocks tumbling by
declaring the industry has been \"getting away with murder\" with drug
pricing; said Republicans will be repealing and replacing the Affordable
Care Act \"essentially simultaneously;\" and announced he\'d name a
Supreme Court pick within two weeks.) [[Any president's
p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital [has a **precariously brief
half-life**]{.mark} that must be constantly renewed. [That is
**especially true** for a newcomer]{.mark} taking office [with a
historically low approval rating]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[one]{.underline} [who's]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably [[**more feared
than loved** among his **own party** on Capitol
Hill]{.underline}]{.mark}. And fissures with the Hill GOP were already
evident Wednesday. As Trump was preparing to take the stage at Trump
Tower in New York, his nominee for Secretary of State, former ExxonMobil
CEO Rex Tillerson, was in a Senate hearing room, absorbing a withering
line of questioning from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump's former rival
in the Republican presidential primaries later sounded noncommittal
about whether he'd vote to move Tillerson's nomination to the full
Senate. Since Republicans only enjoy a one-vote margin in the Senate
Foreign Affairs Committee, a defection by Rubio would stall the nod
there. Senate Republican leaders could then bypass the panel, but it
would amount to a major black eye for the incoming administration. Rubio
has a finely-tuned political antenna and ambitions manifestly bigger
than the Senate. Such [[an **early stand against the president-elect
would signal turbulence ahead for the matters that matter to
business**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It's been said that Obama might somehow be better off politically if the
Court were to strike down the unpopular parts of the law (or even all of
it). According to this reasoning, he could then avoid the problem of
defending the law on the campaign trail and concentrate instead on
issues on which the Democratic view is more popular. This is nonsense.

### A2: No Link\-\--Teflon Trump

#### [Irrelevant]{.underline} -- it's about the [creation of fights]{.underline} generally

#### Presidents are the focal point of politics -- they get the credit/blame

**CNN** Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer 4/28/**02**

Bruce Morton, Cnn Correspondent: [[Networks]{.mark} will often [air
whatever the president says]{.mark}, even if he\'s praising the Easter
Bunny]{.underline}. Blitzer: Competing for face time on the cable news
networks. Stay with us. Blitzer: Welcome back. Time now for Bruce
Morton\'s essay on the struggle for balanced coverage on the cable
networks. Morton: The Democrats have written the three cable news
networks \-- CNN, Fox and MSNBC \-- complaining that the Bush
administration gets much more coverage than elected Democrats. They cite
CNN, which they say, from January 1 through March 21, aired 157 live
events involving the Bush administration, and 7 involving elected
Democrats. Fox and MS, they say, did much the same thing. The coverage
gap is certainly real, for several reasons. First, since September 11,
the U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan, so the president has been an
active commander in chief. And covering the war, networks will often air
whatever the president says, even if he\'s praising the Easter Bunny.
Plus, the White House press secretary\'s briefing, the Pentagon\'s,
maybe the State Department\'s. Why not? It\'s easy, it\'s cheap, the
cameras are pooled, and in war time, the briefings may make major news.
You never know. But [there\'s a reason for the coverage gap that\'s
older than]{.underline} Mr. [Bush\'s administration. In war or peace,
[the president is a commanding figure]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- one man
to whose politics and character and, nowadays, sex life, endless
attention is paid. [[Congress is 535 people. What it does is
**complicated**]{.underline}]{.mark}, compromises on budget items [[done
in **private**]{.mark}**,** and **[lacks]{.mark} the
[drama]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the White House. There\'s a primetime
TV show about a president. None about the Congress. If a small newspaper
has one reporter in Washington, he\'ll cover two things, the local
congressional delegation and, on big occasions, the White House. So the
complaining Democrats have a point, [but it\'s worth remembering that
[coverage of a president, while]{.mark} always [intense, isn\'t always
positive]{.mark}]{.underline}. You could [ask the Clintons]{.underline}.
9 [[Presidents will]{.mark} always [get more coverage than
Congresses]{.mark}. They\'re sexier. But it won\'t always be coverage
they like]{.underline}.

#### Presidency is the focal point of politics -- president gets the credit or the blame, deserved or not

**Rosati 4.** \[Jerel A., University of South Carolina Government and
International Studies professor The Politics of United States Foreign
Policy, 2004, p. 80\]

**Given the popular image of presidential power,** [[presidents receive
credit when things are]{.mark} perceived as [going well and]{.mark} are
[blamed when things go badly]{.mark}. Unfortunately, American politics
and [the policy process are incredibly complex]{.mark} [and
beyond]{.mark} considerable [presidential control]{.mark}. With so many
complex issues and problems to address -- the debt problem, the economy,
energy, welfare, education, the environment, foreign policy -- this is a
very demanding time to be president]{.underline}**. As long as
presidential promises and public expectations remain high, the
president's job becomes virtually an impossible task. Should success
occur, given the lack of presidential power, it is probably not by the
president's own design. Nonetheless,** [the president]{.underline} **--
the person perceived to be the leader of the country --** [will be
rewarded in terms of public prestige, greater power, and reelection (for
him or his successor). However, [if the president is perceived as
unsuccessful]{.mark} -- a failure -- [this results]{.mark} not only [in
a weakened presiden]{.mark}t but one the public wants replaced, creating
the opportunity to challenge an incumbent president or his heir as
presidential nominee.]{.underline}

It's unusually petty and strange for a president-elect to do this, yes.
But there is actually good reason for Trump to be concerned about his
share of the popular vote. After all, the current tabulation suggests
that [53.5 percent of Americans cast ballots for someone not
named]{.underline} Donald [Trump, and [politicians are]{.mark} generally
[stronger when they have **demonstrated**]{.mark} **popular
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[That translates to]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital [and an]{.mark} easier time
pursuing your [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} your [[opponents]{.mark} --- and]{.underline}
perhaps even [skeptical]{.underline} congressional
[Republicans]{.underline}, in Trump's case --- [[less likely to **stand
in your way**]{.underline}]{.mark}. ([Witness]{.underline} President
[Obama's mandate in the wake of]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline}
election, [for example]{.underline}.)

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, [[has a **historically small
mandate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And if you compare his election to the
57 previous presidential votes, that reality begins to come into clearer
focus.

As of now, [Trump's deficit in the popular vote]{.underline} --- 1.7
points --- [is the third-largest]{.underline} on record [for an election
winner and the second-biggest for an electoral college
winner]{.underline}. The only bigger deficits came in the 19th century,
when Rutherford B. Hayes won the 1876 election by one(!) electoral vote
despite losing the popular vote by three points, and when John Quincy
Adams was declared the winner by the House of Representatives despite
losing the electoral vote and the popular vote to Andrew Jackson by more
than 10 points. (It was a crowded race, and Jackson was shy of a
majority of electoral votes.)

Trump is also taking less of the popular vote --- 46.5 percent --- than
all but seven previous winners. That number is likely to creep down
closer to 46 percent as the remaining votes get counted, but he is still
likely to finish eighth from the bottom (next lowest is Grover Cleveland
in 1892 at 46.02 percent).

Among those seven winners who took less of the popular vote, though, six
faced a third-party candidate who was formidable enough to actually win
a state, and the seventh was Bill Clinton, who also faced a formidable
third-party candidate --- Ross Perot --- who took 19 percent of the
national vote but didn\'t quite carry a state. Clinton took just 43
percent of the vote but won the popular vote by six points over ~~Bob
Dole~~ George H.W. Bush.

The strongest third-party showing in the 2016 election was from
Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, who is taking slightly more than 3
percent of the vote right now. The worst third-party showing in any of
the other races was 8.5 percent, which is what Populist Party candidate
James B. Weaver took in 1892 as a regional candidate who won five
Western states. The leading third-party candidate in every other race
won at least double digits.

In other words, there was far less splitting up of the vote in the 2016
election than in the seven elections that produced a winner with a
smaller share of the vote. While those seven candidacies can all
credibly point to a third-party candidate diluting the vote, Trump
really can't. Yes, Johnson set a record for a Libertarian candidate's
share of the vote, but he was ultimately a non-factor in the race.

[[Does that mean Trump is sunk]{.mark} as president[?]{.mark} Of course
**[no]{.mark}**t.]{.underline} The vote is one thing. [From here, [it's
about **how he handles the presidency and builds**]{.mark} **his
[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital**]{.underline}. [The best
indicator]{.underline} of that [will be his approval
rating]{.underline}, which hasn't been measured since he won the
election. His favorable rating --- which is more about his personal
appeal than job performance --- bumped up after his election but still
stood at just 42 percent, according to Gallup. That's lower than any
president-elect on record and is notably less even than his 46.5 percent
of the vote.

[But for now, [Trump's]{.mark} political [mandate
is]{.mark}]{.underline} very, [**[very small]{.underline}**. [He
will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[**succeed** in getting
**some**]{.mark} of his [priorities through Congress]{.mark} thanks to
the GOP's congressional majorities, [but the American people are
skeptical]{.mark}]{.underline} of their president-elect, even as they
elected him president.

The popular vote doesn't technically matter when it come to electing
presidents, but [popular appeal **does matter** when it comes to how
presidents can govern]{.underline}. And the idea that a majority of
Americans still don't like our president-elect is eating at Trump --- as
it probably should.

"If personnel is the beginning of policy, we believe that [he's laying
the groundwork to shake up a lot of the Washington
establishment]{.underline} and the bureaucracy of the federal
government," Head said.

Vander Plaats expects Trump to follow through on his commitment to
appoint conservative Supreme Court justices and repeal the Johnson
Amendment, which bars churches and other tax-exempt organizations from
engaging in political campaigns.

"[[Once]{.mark} the President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} --- versus
President-elect Trump --- [and the Congress [is working]{.mark} and he's
in administrative mode]{.underline}, I think the
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}, his base, others, they
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} find ways to [[remind
him]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'hey, [this was a promise, we expect you [to
deliver]{.mark}]{.underline},'" he said. "And
[[they're]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[gonna give
him]{.underline}]{.mark} I think a little bit of [[leeway]{.mark} for
his own leadership [right now]{.mark}]{.underline}. I think most of us
know this country needs to be turned around, and we're hoping and
praying that he can deliver on turning this country around."

[Tyler]{.underline}, the former Cruz spokesman, [used economic terms to
convey his message to [Trump]{.mark} and the fine line he's
walking]{.underline}.

"[He]{.underline} basically [[has a surplus of]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital in his base.
[And]{.mark}]{.underline} what [he [seems to be]{.mark} doing is
**[trading that]{.mark} political currency** [for **establishment
currency**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Tyler explained. "[And [he can do
that, as long as he **keeps his accounts

**[Time Management and the President's Agenda]{.underline}**

[[Presidents use a wide range of tactics to **set policy**]{.mark},
including their ability [to **influence the**]{.mark} **legislative
[agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and staff vacancies]{.underline} to
lower level federal courts. In terms of influencing the legislative
agenda, [modern [presidents **introduce legislation** and **define
policy**]{.mark} **alternatives**]{.underline} (Covington, Wrighton
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Kinney 1995; Eshbaugh-Soha 2005, 2010). While
not unconditional, [presidents]{.underline} [[can use their time and
effort to **secure**]{.mark} **the [passage of key policy
proposals]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([Edwards and Wood 1999; Light 1999;
Neustadt 1960]{.underline}). [Importantly]{.underline},
[[though]{.underline}]{.mark}, [presidents' **[ability to
persuade]{.mark} the public** [is **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [To
be **successful**]{.underline}]{.mark} in enacting desired policies
[[presidents have to **time**]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[**proposals**
to **align with favorable conditions**]{.mark} in public opinion and
legislative makeup]{.underline} (Edwards 2009).

#### It [tips the scales]{.underline}, through [agenda-setting]{.underline}, [signaling]{.underline}, and [political cover]{.underline}

**Gelman, 15** -- Jeremy Gelman, University of Michigan; Gilad
Wilkenfeld and E. Scott Adler, University of Colorado; "The
Opportunistic President: How US Presidents Determine Their Legislative
Programs", August 2015, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 40:3

[[The president's legislative program]{.underline}]{.mark},1 which is
the set of proposals sent from the president to the legislative branch,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} viewed as [**[pivotal]{.underline}** [in
presidential-congressional relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. We see
evidence of the privileged place these requests have in three ways.
First, [[they **shape Congress's**]{.mark} **lawmaking
[agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Over 70% of]{.mark} the
president's]{.underline} issue [[priorities get]{.mark} congressional
[consideration, and]{.mark} significant
[legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} sent by the administration [[is
**almost always debated**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Edwards and Barrett
2000; Peterson 1990). Second, [these policy [proposals
are]{.mark}]{.underline} traditionally viewed as [[a
tool]{.underline}]{.mark} the president can use [[to **open**]{.mark}
**policy [windows]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **create**]{.mark} **more
[accommodating]{.mark} lawmaking [environments]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Kingdon reports that "[no other single actor in the political system
has]{.underline} quite [the capability of [the president]{.mark} to
**set agendas**]{.underline} in given policy areas\..." (1984, 23).
Third, [these proposals [provide **cues to
legislators**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} which [issues they
can **successfully politicize** by opposing or supporting the
president's]{.mark} policy [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lee 2009).

As [[the president's program]{.underline}]{.mark} heavily influences
legislative attention and the level of partisanship within Congress, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[crucial]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [understanding [the broader policymaking
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. To that end, we examine why presidents
select some issues to promote in their legislative agenda and not
others.

#### Trump PC [shapes agenda]{.underline} through [public pressure]{.underline} and the [news cycle]{.underline}

**Catanese, 16** -- David Catanese, Senior Politics Writer for U.S. News
& World Report, 12-8-2016, "With Rallies and Tweets, Trump Reshaping the
Bully Pulpit",
http://www.usnews.com/news/the-run-2016/articles/2016-12-08/donald-trump-builds-a-new-bully-pulpit-with-rallies-tweets

Donald [[Trump]{.mark} is]{.underline} still six weeks from his
Inauguration Day, and yet he\'s [already signaling he[\'ll]{.mark}
**[expand the]{.mark} presidential [bully pulpit]{.mark}** to bounds not
seen before]{.underline}. [This week]{.underline} alone, the
president-elect is [holding [rallies]{.mark} in three battleground
states]{.underline} -- North Carolina, Iowa and Michigan -- as part of
his \"Thank you\" tour.

But these [rallies]{.underline} -- which look, sound and feel
indistinguishable from his campaign events -- [are about much more
than]{.underline} simply offering [thanks]{.underline}. [They appear
purposefully designed to portray Trump as a perpetual
victor]{.underline}. He\'s placed squarely [inside a reaffirming venue
that\'s used]{.underline} as a vehicle [to champion even the smallest of
successes]{.underline}, and [to [push]{.mark} and press [forward
his]{.mark} unconventional [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline} before adoring
fans.

[[To]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[members of
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}** watching from their television screens
and Twitter feeds on Capitol Hill, [[it\'s a **constant**]{.mark} and
powerful **[reminder]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [the masses are with
him]{.mark}. And [these]{.mark} events [are]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[likely]{.underline} than not to remain [[a **permanent
fixture**]{.mark} of his presidency]{.underline}.

\"What [[it]{.underline}]{.mark} does is [[assist him]{.mark} with
**[communicating]{.mark}** and **laying out [his
agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It helps **build
momentum**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for that agenda]{.underline}. [People
are]{.underline} just [loving these. He didn\'t win and go into
hiding]{.underline},\" says Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who
serves on Trump\'s transition team. \"[[It will]{.mark}
help]{.underline} to **[[put]{.underline}]{.mark}** some [**[pressure on
Congress]{.underline}** [to move swiftly. 2017 is not going to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [usual]{.mark}]{.underline},
standard-operating-procedure [year in Washington]{.underline}, D.C.\"

Take Trump\'s Tuesday night event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home
of Fort Bragg, the largest military base in the U.S. by population.
Trump used it to formally unveil his selection for secretary of defense,
retired Marine Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis.

\"Mad Dog plays no games, right?\" Trump crowed.

Because he\'s only been retired for three years, Mattis will need a
special waiver from Congress in order to bypass a law that prohibits
recent active officers from serving as secretary of defense.

Before thousands of supporters still waving campaign placards, Trump
applied his case.

\"If he didn\'t get that waiver, there\'d be a lot of angry people,\"
Trump said. \"Such a popular choice.\"

It\'s just one example of how [Trump is transferring]{.underline} the
[energy from his campaign to governance]{.underline}.

\"**[[He\'s a performance artist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [That\'s what
he does for a living]{.underline}. Performers must perform. [He feeds
off]{.underline} the [crowds]{.underline}, he [gathers]{.underline} his
[strength and momentum from them]{.underline}. I doubt he\'ll suddenly
switch that light off, because he may feel unalive,\" says Douglas
Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University.
\"He won\'t make a differentiation between campaigning and governing --
it\'s still all the Donald Trump show. He has a winning formula right
now.

\"Why change courses in midstream because people say other presidents
haven\'t done that?\"

What may get in the way of Trump\'s perpetual roadshow is the
responsibilities of governing. A [foreign policy crisis]{.underline}. A
heightened national security threat. A [budget battle]{.underline}.
These [are]{.underline} all nearly [inevitable instances that require a
president to huddle and strategize in person with his
advisers]{.underline}.

[But this is where Trump\'s second specialized weapon comes into play:
his **Twitter** account]{.underline}.

While Obama became the first president to tweet in 2015, his miniature
missives generally have been formal, banal and forgettable. Trump\'s
tweets are the exact opposite, and there\'s no mistake about who\'s
drafting them. They\'re spontaneous, humorous and often substantive,
though the veracity of their substance has been called into question on
multiple occasions.

[Trump\'s [tweets]{.mark} already [are **driving**]{.mark} **cable
[news]{.mark} coverage**, **[molding policy]{.mark}** and placing
opponents on notice]{.underline}. For instance, just this week he\'s
used his account to attack China\'s currency devaluation and activity in
the South China Sea, propose canceling a plan for Boeing to produce a
new Air Force One, and attack the head of a United Steelworkers branch.

[The ability to singularly drive a news cycle from the palm of his hand
is]{.underline} going to be [[a new phenomenon that]{.mark} will
**[test]{.mark} the [traditional]{.mark} roles of
[policymaking]{.mark}**]{.underline} and journalism.

Yet there are some who believe the novelty of Trump\'s tweets eventually
will wear off.

\"He\'s got tremendous political capital now, but he\'s burning through
it with tweets. You use these tweets too frequently and they\'re going
to lose all force. It becomes entertainment, not persuasion,\" says Paul
Light, a professor of public service at New York University.

That wasn\'t true of the campaign, however, when Trump\'s tweets were
often the dominant topic of conversation, for better or for worse.

With Trump reducing the number of interviews he grants and not having
held a press conference in months, his tweets have become the prime
conduit to the president-elect\'s mind. News organizations have little
choice but to track them.

\"[The new reality is]{.underline} Donald [Trump\'s tweets are going to
be running the news cycle. It\'s not going to stop]{.underline},\"
Brinkley says. \"[It\'s [a **new form of
governing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some people will find it tacky and
crass. Others will say it\'s a clever way to go over Washington, D.C.,
officialdom and speak directly to the American people. It\'s going to
make the press conference and pool reporters antiquated.\"

He adds, \"It\'s almost like Confucius spreading strange wisdom. [Every
day]{.underline} he\'s pumping verbage into our news cycle and [[he\'s
able to]{.mark} control]{.underline} -- with the number of characters,
using choice words -- to goad [people]{.underline}, get under people\'s
skin, seek revenge [and **[move policy]{.mark} forward [in his
direction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

[Taken together, Trump\'s [**megarallies and tweetstorms** are]{.mark}
already **[ushering in a reimagined]{.mark} presidential
[pulpit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one [that plays to his strength of pithy
performance art laced with dashes of suspense]{.underline}.

#### PC real and ensures passage\-\--it's key to [both]{.underline} the left [and]{.underline} right

\-\--GOP reps can only buck Trump so many times, or they'll lose
primaries

\-\--Trump PC effective with red/purple state Dems

The bully pulpit",
http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/307194-trumps-new-weapon-the-bully-pulpit

[[Trump showed he **isn\'t shy**]{.mark} **in [going after]{.mark}
members of [his own party]{.mark}** through]{.underline}out
[the]{.underline} 2016 [presidential cycle]{.underline}. And that
probably won\'t change in 2017 and 2018.

[The]{.underline} conservative-leaning House [Freedom Caucus
and]{.underline} outside [[right-wing groups are wary of
Trump\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} \$1 trillion [infrastructure
[proposal]{.mark}]{.underline} and want the 45th president to focus on
reducing the nation\'s record debt levels. The Freedom Caucus was
instrumental in pushing former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) out the
door, [[but picking a fight with Trump is **another thing**]{.mark}
**entirely**]{.underline}. Most
[[R]{.mark}epublican[s]{.mark}]{.underline} in the House don\'t worry
about their November election --- they [[worry about]{.mark} their
[primaries. And **crossing Trump** could risk]{.mark} a [**challenge
from the right** in]{.mark} the [2018]{.mark} cycle]{.underline}.

Speaker Paul [[Ryan]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-Wis.) [[and
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} feuded in 2016, but in the name of party
unity and policy, they have [[put aside]{.mark} their
[differences]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
related development, [Ryan\'s [approval]{.mark}]{.underline} rating just
[[hit an **all-time high**]{.mark} **earlier this month**]{.underline}.

After the election, Ryan said it\'s time for the Republican Party to "go
big" and "bold." Trump wouldn\'t have it any other way, though [[there
are]{.mark} inherent [**risks** with an **aggressive strategy** without
a supermajority]{.mark} in the Senate]{.underline}.

Republicans who publicly ripped Trump are now getting in line, so
muscling big-ticket items through the upper chamber using budget
reconciliation shouldn\'t be that challenging. Those bills, such as
ObamaCare repeal, would only need 51 Senate votes to pass. But replacing
ObamaCare, building a wall along the southern border and clearing a
Supreme Court nominee will necessitate 60 votes.

That's where [[**Trump\'s bully pulpit will come in**, **calling out
Dem**]{.mark}**ocrat[s]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} both [red and purple
states]{.mark} that [he won]{.mark} on Election Day]{.underline}.

While Trump may not be up to speed on the nuances of the legislative
process, those mechanics will be handled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) and Ryan.

Still, [[the **fate of pending bills**]{.underline}]{.mark} isn\'t
decided by tactics. It [[comes down to **marketing and political
muscle**]{.mark}, which **play to [Trump\'s
strengths]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Trump will surely have a slew of critics]{.underline} of anything he
wants to do. They will throw everything they have to kill his agenda.

Trump\'s likely response: "This bill will help make America great again.
It should be passed as soon as possible."

Democrats will need to step up their messaging game to thwart Trump\'s
agenda. Sen. Charles [[Schumer]{.underline}]{.mark} (D-N.Y.), who will
be minority leader next year, had [[pledged to work with Trump]{.mark}
on areas of common ground]{.underline}. He has also vowed to battle
Trump when warranted, most notably on attempts to eradicate Obama\'s
legacy laws.

### A2: Trump Fails

#### Trump knows how to use PC - he's got key leverage and effective bargaining skills

**Delamaide, 17** \-\-- Darrell, Politics Columnist @ MarketWatch, 1/3,
<http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-will-play-congress-like-a-fiddle-2017-01-03>

[[Trump will play Congress like a fiddle New president will bargain, not
rubber-stamp]{.underline}]{.mark} Republican agenda The full scope of
Hillary Clinton's loss and Donald Trump's victory will become apparent
this week as the newly elected Congress convenes. We all know the
[[Republicans swept the elections]{.underline}]{.mark}, winning the
White House and retaining control of both houses of Congress. But it is
where these victories came from and how they were made that tells us
what will happen in the two years this 115th Congress will have until
midterm elections in 2018. [[There is obviously a great deal of overlap
between Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} campaign [[pledges and the standing
agenda of congressional Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} under House
Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But there
are also some significant differences --- in the approach to trade
issues and deficit spending, to name just two. Trump's pledge to
maintain and defend Medicare and Social Security is another important
difference. Congressional Republicans may think they are about to reach
the Promised Land, and Washington Post reporter David Weigel this week
neatly summed up the various bills they have vetted on issues from
deregulation to repealing Obamacare that are just waiting for a
president to sign into law. But if Trump has proven anything in his
idiosyncratic campaign, it is that he is hardly just "a Republican with
enough working digits to handle a pen" --- the ideal president once
dreamed of by tax reform activist Grover Norquist. In other words, it's
not likely Trump will simply rubber-stamp legislation that a Republican
Congress churns out. Why would someone who trumpets his expertise in
negotiation simply give Congress what it wants? [[He will hold back
on]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[signatures as **leverage to get what he
want**s]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially when it runs counter to or
simply beyond the lawmakers' agenda. Salena Zito, a pro-Trump
commentator who catapulted to prominence for her insights into the Trump
campaign, reminds us that the key to understanding the incoming
president is his 1987 book, "The Art of the Deal." Trump voters
understood what mainstream media commentators still haven't grasped ---
[[many of his statements are]{.underline}]{.mark} not ex cathedra
pronouncements on policies but **[[negotiating
ploys]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, yes, many of them are not completely
true. "Throughout the book, he is always negotiating, no matter if he
was coming from a full truth or not, didn't matter," Zito writes of the
1987 book in the Washington Examiner. "It is always about the value of
what is at stake. In that type of barter, truthfulness becomes
irrelevant, it only has actuality if the deal is struck and the facts
come out." Which brings us back to Congress and how Trump will deal with
it. Even though Republicans retained control of both houses, Democrats
trimmed those majorities even as Clinton won a commanding plurality in
the popular vote for president. The Republican majority in the Senate
went to 52 from 54, out of 100, and to 241 from 247, out of 435 in the
House. The electoral upsets that enabled Republicans to maintain the
Senate majority were the victories of Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Pat
Toomey in Pennsylvania, two Republican incumbents most pollsters
predicted would lose to Democratic challengers, Russ Feingold and
Kathleen McGinty. But Trump's surprising win in those swing states also
lifted the two incumbents to an unexpected victory. Had Clinton's
campaign in those states been slightly more effective she might be the
president-elect with Democratic control of the Senate. Democrats were
bound to recapture the Senate seat in Illinois, but they also won a
closely fought battle in New Hampshire, where the popular governor,
Maggie Hassan, defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. It may well
have been Ayotte's disavowal of Trump that cost her the margin of
victory. The lesson here, as with unsuccessful Nevada Senate candidate
Joe Heck, who lost ground after distancing himself from Trump, is that
[[Republican lawmakers **need Trump's support to gain voter favor** more
than he needs them.]{.mark}]{.underline} The picture from the House
results is a little less clear-cut. Although every member is up for
re-election every two years, the rate of incumbency victories is very
high. In 2016, 380 of the 393 incumbents seeking re-election won, for an
incumbency rate of 96.7%. According to Ballotpedia, Democrats tend to
gain seats in presidential election years with their higher voter
turnout, while Republicans tend to gain in the midterm elections. For
instance, Democrats gained eight sets in 2012 and 24 in 2008, which make
the net gain of six in 2016 seem relatively small. So Republicans are
likely to make gains in the House [[in 2018]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
Senate, Republicans will be defending only eight seats, while
[[Democrats will be defending]{.underline}]{.mark} 25 --- 10 of which
are [[in state]{.underline}]{.mark}s that [[Trump
won]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Those 10 Democratic senators will be **very
careful about thwarting Trump**, which **makes his leverage in the
Senate considerably larger**]{.underline}]{.mark} than the 52
Republicans. Trump may be a political novice, but if [he's]{.underline}
half as [skillful at negotiation]{.underline} as he claims to be, [he
will quickly grasp how to play the legislature like a
fiddle.]{.underline}

#### Trump knows how to use PC effectively, but its finite and drained by major fights over external policies

**Collinson, 17\-\--**Stephen, political columnist at CNN, 1/4,
<http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/donald-trump-republicans-congress/>

[[Trump throws weight around]{.mark} Washington]{.underline} Donald
Trump isn\'t even in Washington yet, but he\'s already throwing his
weight around. [The President-elect **[prevailed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Tuesday in the first exchange of what could turn out to be an awkward,
sometimes turbulent relationship [[with fellow Republicans]{.mark} on
Capitol Hill.]{.underline} A full-blown PR disaster threatened to derail
the first day of the new Congress as House Republicans prepared to move
forward with a measure that would have gutted an independent ethics
office. As the scope of the controversy became clear by mid-morning,
[Trump threw cold water on the plan]{.underline}, calling the ethics
watchdog \"unfair,\" but [[suggesting there were bigger
priorities]{.mark} for lawmakers to tackle]{.underline}. \"With all that
Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of
the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \... may be, their
number one act and priority,\" Trump said in consecutive tweets. \"Focus
on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater
importance!\" Within hours, House GOP lawmakers met in an emergency
session and decided unanimously to remove the ethics provisions from a
broader package slated for a vote later in the day. [[The episode was
the first test of Trump\'s **ability to exert influence over his
party**]{.mark} **in Congress**.]{.underline} It\'s unclear whether
Trump\'s tweets were the sole deciding factor in the GOP\'s flip or
whether lawmakers were responding to intense pressure from constituents.
A brief history of the House GOP\'s failed ethics ploy Either way, it\'s
certain the blowback intensified to a new level once Trump turned to
Twitter. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who backed the attempt to gut the
ethics panel that many lawmakers believe overreaches, said Trump\'s
comment \"animated the press\" and created pressure on GOP lawmakers to
change course. \"I\'m concerned that now we have Republicans criticizing
Republicans,\" King said. \"We need to stay away from that.\" Some
lawmakers said they decided independently their move was unwise and
didn\'t need Trump to tell them. [Perception in Washington]{.underline}
But [in a sense, it does not matter. The [perception quickly jelled in
Washington that Trump put himself at the center of the storm and changed
the weather]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Such actions tend to **enhance a
President\'s perceived power, especially in the crucial early
months**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[of his administration]{.underline}**.
The GOP wrangle was not Trump\'s only win on Tuesday. Ford announced it
would nix a plan to build a factory in Mexico and would spend \$700
million to bring 700 jobs to Michigan, crediting Trump\'s policies for
the move. Democrats will argue that such interventions pale into
comparison to the millions of jobs created by President Barack Obama.
But Trump faces the likely impossible challenge of returning US
manufacturing jobs from low-wage economies abroad. So in the case of
Ford, as with the spat on Capitol Hill, [[the **symbolism and media
coverage is far more important than context.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In
the meantime, [Tuesday\'s drama offered a **preview of how Trump will
govern**]{.underline}. The Twitter president appears unlikely to be
content with working congressional back channels and using conventional
levers of power to get his way. The day\'s events also showed that
[while Trump may be a Washington newbie, [he **knows how to score an
easy political win.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Trump hotel lawsuit at
impasse, headed to trial For much of his transition, Trump has been
hounded by ethics questions of his own, centering on potential huge
conflicts of interests posed by his global business interests. His
wealthy cabinet picks \-- such as Rex Tillerson for secretary of state
and Steve Mnuchin for Treasury \-- are being accused by Democrats of
failing to provide sufficient financial data and other information ahead
of their confirmation hearings. But Trump can now present himself as a
champion of ethical standards on Capitol Hill and argue that he has
already taken a step to honor his vow of draining Washington\'s
political swamp. The exchange also appeared to hint at the Republican
hierarchy in Washington after the inauguration and the incoming
president\'s relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan, a Wisconsin
Republican, initially opposed the change to ethics rules. But once he
was defied by his troops, he fell into line, issuing a statement
defending the move \-- only for GOP lawmakers to reverse themselves
later. [Sway with the GOP [The way the confrontation ended **left an
impression**]{.mark} that [Trump, **basking in**]{.mark} **the
[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital** that new presidents enjoy, [may
have]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[much sway with the restive Republican
caucus]{.underline}]{.mark}** as Ryan himself, who was re-elected
speaker on Tuesday. [Of course, [life is going to get a lot
tougher]{.mark}]{.underline} for the President-elect. [[Despite]{.mark}
their [common political aims]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- repealing
Obamacare, [[passing big tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} and beginning a

### Econ\-\--IL\-\--A2: Debt Ceiling Not Key

#### Debt ceiling failure [obliterates]{.underline} the economy -- outweighs [every other]{.underline} economic issue -- extraordinary measures [will run out]{.underline}

*Fortune*, "\'Debt Ceiling\' May Become a Political Buzzword This

[[Of]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [economic
missteps]{.mark} that can and do happen]{.underline} in the
U.S.---prolonged major [deficit spending, nonexistent budgets,
unpredictable policies, tumultuous
tariffs]{.underline}---[[the]{.underline} **[worst by far]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [the possibility of the government
[defaulting]{.mark} on its payments]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}**
[[there's an outside chance of that]{.mark} happening this fall [if
Congress cannot]{.mark}]{.underline} agree to [[raise
the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called ["debt
[ceiling]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[While **[a single standoff]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in 2011 (that
resulted in an increased ceiling)]{.underline} **[[drew a credit]{.mark}
rating [downgrade]{.mark}]{.underline}** from AAA to AA+ from Standard &
Poor's [that is]{.underline} **[[still in effect]{.mark}
today]{.underline}**, [the potential [damage of]{.mark} an [actual
default is **incalculable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Which is why [there
is]{.underline} **[cause for concern]{.underline}**: The U.S. hit the
debt ceiling of \$22 trillion on March 2. At this point, [[the U.S.
**cannot**]{.underline} [issue new bonds]{.underline}]{.mark} [to borrow
money [and]{.mark}]{.underline} so [[has **only cash**]{.mark} **on
hand**]{.underline} [to pay bills. Only]{.underline} the Treasury
Department's use of so-called [extraordinary
measures]{.underline}---basically accounting tricks---[is keeping the
government functioning]{.underline} and not running out of money.
**[But]{.underline}** [[come September, the U.S.]{.mark} **officially
[will run out]{.mark} of cash**]{.underline} [to pay its
obligations.]{.underline} [[While]{.mark} experts say **the [probability
is low]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that Congress would allow a
default]{.underline}, the [unpredictability of]{.underline} Donald
[Trump makes the [unthinkable]{.mark} **something that [could
happen]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Why the ceiling matters]{.underline}

The debt ceiling, first initiated in 1917, is often misunderstood. "The
public operates under the misperception that raising the debt ceiling
has something to do with the current level of debt, which it does not,
or that it has something to do with government spending," said Eric
Winograd, a senior economist at investment management firm
AllianceBernstein.

The debt ceiling limits the total amount of outstanding debt the U.S.
has incurred by previously issuing Treasury bonds to pay for its
financial commitments. The process works in a sense like a credit card,
according to Rohit Kumar, now U.S. tax policy services leader for PwC,
formerly deputy chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell. "When you
pay it off, that's paying for what you spent before, not what you're
spending today," Kumar said. People don't tell the credit card company
they're not going to pay because they want to stop spending less today.
The credit card issuer expects payment for what people already spent.

["At the end of the day it keeps the full faith and credit of the United
states in place," said]{.underline} Chris [Campbell]{.underline}, chief
strategist at The Duff & Phelps Institute and former staff director for
Orrin Hatch at the Senate Finance Committee. However, consistent deficit
spending has put the U.S. into a circular rut, with a constant creation
of bonds that add to the total debt, like taking money from one credit
card to pay interest on another. But the practice has become critical to
the country's finances.

The nuclear option

[Without an increase in the debt ceiling, the U.S. cannot borrow more.
"At some point, programs get affected," said]{.underline} Stuart
[Greenbaum]{.underline}, retired dean of the Olin Business School at
Washington University. ["They cut back here, they cut back there on
spending." And some debts don't get paid, **putting the U.S. into
default.**]{.underline}

There are two major parts to the danger. One is the dominance of the
dollar as a standard currency and critical part of the global economy's
foundation as the universally recognized store of value---the instrument
of exchange and financial safety. The U.S. dollar has been the one
trustworthy constant in a sea of change. The consequences of a default
is unimaginably bad.

"The analogy that somebody used was it was like asking what happened if
every nuclear warhead went off---whether you got \[only\] massive
destruction or the end of everything," said Kumar, who was involved in
the negotiations during the 2011 debt crisis.

"Eventually, you can get a run on the dollar," Greenbaum said. The value
of the dollar would plummet, taking with it the stability of
international trade and untold amounts of perceived value.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[issue is the amount of
investment]{.mark} that has been placed [in the]{.mark} trust of the
[U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **["Where are you supposed to go if U.S.
assets are not safe?"]{.underline}** [Winograd asked. "What would be
safe?" **Nothing**]{.underline}. [At stake would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the full faith and credit of the U.S. **and [the global
economy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Hitting the debt ceiling causes [an immediate recession]{.underline} -- impacts are [already being felt]{.underline} and extraordinary measures [won't last]{.underline}

December [if Washington doesn't agree to raise]{.mark} a legal
restriction on public [debt]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[Treasury]{.underline} Department [said]{.underline} on Wednesday.

[[Hitting that]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [["debt ceiling" could
trigger]{.mark} a U.S. [default]{.mark} on its debt]{.underline} **[[and
an immediate recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a risk that has become a
regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. [Treasury has been able to
continue borrowing]{.underline} from investors [by using accounting
measures such as]{.underline} limiting government [payments to public
sector retirement funds]{.underline}.

"[[Treasury expects]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[extraordinary
measures will be **exhausted**]{.underline}]{.mark} [sometime
**[in]{.mark} the second half of [2019]{.mark},"**]{.underline} Treasury
Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian [Smith said]{.underline} in a statement
announcing the department's quarterly debt issuance plans.

Another critical issue is [the debt ceiling]{.underline}, which Congress
suspended in February 2018 but [was reimposed this]{.underline} past
[March]{.underline}. The [[Treasury]{.underline}]{.mark} Department [[is
taking measures to ward off]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[missed
payments]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} [budget [experts
say it can]{.mark}]{.underline} [[do this **only until October**]{.mark}
**or perhaps November**]{.underline}.

[[If Congress doesn't act]{.underline}]{.mark} by then, the
[[Treasury]{.underline}]{.mark} Department [[could]{.mark} be forced to
prioritize payments **and [fall behind]{.mark} on some of its
obligations**]{.underline}. [Many]{.underline} people say [[this would
cause]{.underline} **[a stock market crash]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[a
[spike in]{.mark} interest [rates]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially **[a [global]{.mark} financial
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The debt ceiling must continually be raised]{.underline} because [the
government spends more]{.underline} money [than it brings
in]{.underline} through revenue, and it borrows money to cover the
difference by issuing debt.

https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/averting-a-debt-ceiling-disaster/

And second, there is talk among some administration officials about
various approaches to the "[prioritization]{.underline}" of key debt
payments---so that even in the absence of an increase in the debt
ceiling, the Treasury could still pay creditors by delaying payments of
other obligations or contracts. This [would make breaching the debt
ceiling less catastrophic, since it would avert an actual
default]{.underline} on U.S. government obligations.
**[But]{.underline}** [[a less catastrophic breach]{.mark} of the debt
ceiling]{.underline} **[[could still be]{.mark} pretty
[catastrophic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [especially

#### [Collapse]{.underline} and [escalation]{.underline} are [likely]{.underline}\-\--the impact's [extinction]{.underline}

History, 7/2/14, "Debate: Is 2014, like 1914, A Prelude to World War?,"
The Globe and Mail,
<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/read-and-vote-is-2014-like-1914-a-prelude-to-world-war/article19325504/>)

As we get closer to the centenary of Gavrilo Princip's act of terrorism
in Sarajevo, there is an ever more vivid fear: [[it could happen
again]{.underline}]{.mark}. The approach of [[the]{.mark} hundredth
[anniversary of 1914]{.mark} has [put a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[spotlight
on]{.mark} the [fragility of the world's]{.mark}]{.underline} political
and [[economic]{.mark} security [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the
beginning of 2013, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was
widely ridiculed for evoking the shades of 1913. By now he is looking
like a prophet. By 2014, as [the security situation in the South China
Sea deteriorated]{.underline}, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cast
China as the equivalent to Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany; and the [fighting
in Ukraine and in Iraq is a sharp reminder of the dangers of
escalation]{.underline}. Lessons of 1914 are about more than simply the
dangers of national and sectarian animosities. [[The main story]{.mark}
of today as then [is the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[precariousness
of]{.mark} financial [globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
consequences that political leaders draw from it. In the influential
view of Norman Angell in his 1910 book The Great Illusion, [the
interdependency of the increasingly complex global economy made war
impossible. But]{.underline} [a quite opposite conclusion was possible
and equally plausible]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline} [proved to be
the case]{.underline}. [Given the extent of fragility, a clever twist to
the control levers might make war easily winnable by the economic
hegemon]{.underline}. [[In the wake of an]{.underline}
[epochal]{.underline}]{.mark} [financial [crisis]{.mark} that almost
brought a complete global collapse,]{.underline} [in 1907]{.underline},
[several [countries started to think of finance as]{.mark} primarily [an
instrument of]{.mark} raw [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that could
and should be turned to national advantage. The 1907 panic emanated from
the United States but affected the rest of the world and demonstrated
the fragility of the whole international financial order. The aftermath
of the 1907 crash drove the then hegemonic power -- Great Britain - to
reflect on how it could use its financial power. Between 1905 and 1908,
the British Admiralty evolved the broad outlines of a plan for financial
and economic warfare that would wreck the financial system of its major
European rival, Germany, and destroy its fighting capacity. Britain used
its extensive networks to gather information about opponents. London
banks financed most of the world's trade. Lloyds provided insurance for
the shipping not just of Britain, but of the world. Financial networks
provided the information that allowed the British government to find the
sensitive strategic vulnerabilities of the opposing alliance. What
pre-1914 Britain did anticipated the private-public partnership that
today links technology giants such as Google, Apple or Verizon to U.S.
intelligence gathering. Since last year, the Edward Snowden leaks about
the NSA have shed a light on the way that global networks are used as a
source of intelligence and power. For Britain's rivals, the financial
panic of 1907 showed the necessity of mobilizing financial powers
themselves. The United States realized that it needed a central bank
analogous to the Bank of England. American financiers thought that New
York needed to develop its own commercial trading system that could
handle bills of exchange in the same way as the London market. Some of
[[the dynamics of]{.mark} the pre-[1914]{.mark} financial world
[are]{.mark} now [re-emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Then an
economically declining power, Britain, wanted to use finance as a
weapon]{.underline} against its larger and faster growing competitors,
Germany and the United States. [Now [America is]{.mark}]{.underline} in
turn [[obsessed by]{.mark} being overtaken by
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} -- according to some calculations, set to
become the world's largest economy in 2014. [In the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, [financial institutions
appear]{.mark}]{.underline} both [as [dangerous]{.mark} weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}, but also as potential instruments for the
application of national power. In managing the 2008 crisis, the
dependence of foreign banks on U.S. dollar funding constituted a major
weakness, and required the provision of large swap lines by the Federal
Reserve. The United States provided that support to some countries, but
not others, on the basis of an explicitly political logic, as Eswar
Prasad demonstrates in his new book on the "Dollar Trap." Geo-politics
is intruding into banking practice elsewhere. Before the Ukraine crisis,
Russian banks were trying to acquire assets in Central and Eastern
Europe. European and U.S. banks are playing a much reduced role in Asian
trade finance. Chinese banks are being pushed to expand their role in
global commerce. After the financial crisis, China started to build up
the renminbi as a major international currency. Russia and China have
just proposed to create a new credit rating agency to avoid what they
regard as the political bias of the existing (American-based) agencies.
The next stage in this logic is to think about how financial power can
be directed to national advantage in the case of a diplomatic tussle.
Sanctions are a routine (and not terribly successful) part of the
pressure applied to rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. But
financial pressure can be much more powerfully applied to countries that
are deeply embedded in the world economy. The test is in the Western
imposition of sanctions after the Russian annexation of Crimea.
President Vladimir Putin's calculation in response is that the European
Union and the United States cannot possibly be serious about the
financial war. It would turn into a boomerang: Russia would be less
affected than the more developed and complex financial markets of Europe
and America. [The [threat of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[systemic
disruption]{.underline} [generates]{.underline}]{.mark} [a new sort of
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}, one [that mirrors the decisive
feature of the crisis of the summer of 1914]{.underline}. [At that time,
no one could really know whether clashes would escalate or
not]{.underline}. That feature contrasts remarkably with almost the
entirety of the Cold War, especially since the 1960s, when [the
strategic doctrine of [M]{.mark}utually [A]{.mark}ssured
[D]{.mark}estruction]{.underline} [[left no doubt]{.mark} that
[any]{.mark} superpower [conflict would]{.mark} inevitably
[escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}. The idea of network disruption relies on
the ability to achieve advantage by surprise, and to win at no or low
cost. But it is inevitably a gamble, and raises prospect that others
might, but also might not be able to, mount the same sort of operation.
Just as in 1914, [there is an enhanced temptation to roll the
dice]{.underline}, [even though [the game may be
fatal]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The second scenario, called Mayhem and Chaos, is the opposite of the
first scenario; everything that can go wrong does go wrong. [The world
[economic situation weakens]{.mark} rather than
strengthens]{.underline}, and [[India, China, and **Japan**
suffer]{.mark} a major [reduction in]{.mark} their [growth]{.mark}
rates]{.underline}, further [weakening the global economy]{.underline}.
As a result, [energy demand falls and the price of fossil fuels
plummets, leading to a financial crisis for the energy-producing states,
which are forced to cut back dramatically on expansion programs and
social welfare. That]{.underline} in turn [leads to [**political
unrest**:]{.mark} and [nurtures]{.mark}]{.underline} different
**[[radical groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [including]{.underline}, but
not limited to, [Islamic extremists]{.underline}. The [[internal
stability]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline} some [countries [is
challenged]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [there are more "failed
states]{.underline}." Most serious is [the [collapse of]{.mark} the
democratic government in [Pakistan]{.mark} and its takeover by Muslim
[extremists]{.mark}, who then [take possession of]{.mark} a large number
of [nuclear weapons.]{.mark} The [danger of **war between India and
Pakistan** increases]{.mark} significantly]{.underline}.
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, always worried about an extremist Pakistan,
expands and [[weaponizes]{.mark} its nuclear program.
[That]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[enhances]{.mark} **nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration [in the Middle East]{.mark}**, with Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, and Egypt joining Israel and Iran as nuclear
states.]{.underline} Under these circumstances, [the potential for
nuclear terrorism increases, and the possibility of [a nuclear
**terrorist attack**]{.mark} in either the Western world or in the
oil-producing states [may lead to a]{.mark} further [devastating
collapse]{.mark} of the world economic market, with a tsunami-like
impact on stability. In this scenario, [**major disruptions** can be
expected, with **dire consequences for**]{.mark} **two-thirds of [the
planet's population]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[We live in]{.mark} a time of]{.underline} [[great strategic
fluidity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Borders are shifting. Lines of control
are blurring. [Long-[established spheres of influence are fading]{.mark}
away]{.underline}. Some states are decaying and dissolving as others
germinate and take root. The [[global economic order is precarious.
New]{.mark} economic and geopolitical [fault lines are
emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The great powers of North and South America are barely on speaking
terms. [[Europe is]{.underline}]{.mark} again [[riven by geopolitical
antagonisms.]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} should be a
prosperous, independent borderland between the European Union and
Russia. It [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[become a **cockpit
of**]{.mark} **strategic [contention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia have relapsed into
hostility]{.underline}. The post-Ottoman borders of West Asia and North
Africa are being erased. Neither Europeans, nor Russians, nor Americans
can now protect or direct their longstanding clients in the Middle East.
Brazil, China, and India are peacefully competing for the favor of
Africa. But, in the Indo-Pacific, [[China and Japan are at **daggers

[Sino-American relations seem to be following]{.underline} US-Russian
relations [into mutual exasperation and intransigence]{.underline}.

No one surveying this scene could disagree that the world would benefit
from recrafting the relationships between its great powers. As President
Xi Jinping has proposed, new types of relations might enable the great
powers to manage their interactions to the common advantage while
lowering the risk of armed conflict. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark},
after all, [[the nuclear age]{.mark}. A [war could]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[end in]{.mark} the [annihilation of all]{.mark} who take part in
it]{.underline}. Short of that, unbridled animosity and contention
between great powers and their allies and friends have high opportunity
costs and foster the tensions inherent in military posturing, arms
races, instability, and impoverishment.

Last week, two events made it clear that [the [U.S. and world]{.mark}
economy [are]{.mark}]{.underline} still **[[plagued by
stagnation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [[consequences **could
not**]{.mark} **[be more ominous]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Countries
that experience]{.underline}]{.mark} [protracted]{.underline} periods of
[[below average growth]{.underline}]{.mark} [are more likely to
[elect]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[extremist]{.mark} right-wing
[politicians]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [This is especially true in
nations with existing]{.underline}]{.mark} [extremist
[parties]{.mark}---like Tea Party Republicans in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [the British National
Party, the National Front in France]{.underline}, [and the National
Democratic Party in Germany]{.underline}---[along with [minimal
barriers]{.mark} to entry]{.underline} in the election arena, which have
been [fortified by]{.underline} the [Citizens United]{.underline} ruling
[[and]{.mark} the rise of]{.underline} independently [[wealthy
candidates such as]{.underline}]{.mark} Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We are]{.underline} now [witnessing
the]{.underline} **[frightening political manifestation]{.underline}**
[of economic stagnation]{.underline}.

The first event was the fourth quarter GDP release for the United
States. Gross Domestic Product---the broadest measure of economic
production---only grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the last
quarter of 2015. In the past year, GDP has only grown 1.8 percent, down
from 2.1 percent since the end of the recession in 2009. And this is
lower than the historical growth rate of 3 percent. Furthermore, since
2008, the U.S. economy has been producing less than its potential,
averaging \$652 billion per year, costing every American over \$16,000
in lost income.

The second event was a radical policy change from the Bank of Japan, who
lowered interest rates to -0.1 percent on central bank deposits to
stimulate lending and growth. In other words, the Bank of Japan now
charges banks to hold their money, making it the fourth economy after
the Eurozone, Denmark, and Sweden to dip below the zero lower bound. The
logic is that banks will pass on interest rate savings to consumers and
businesses in the form of cheaper loans.

The United States, the Eurozone, and Japan---three of the world's four
largest economies---have engaged in unprecedented monetary stimulus
since 2008 by slashing interest rates, and flooding their economies with
credit. And yet growth in each of these economies is anemic. Why hasn't
the multi-trillion dollar monetary stimulus boosted growth?

The answer is that the current stagnation needs both monetary stimulus,
which has mainly boosted the prices of assets disproportionately owned
by the wealthy, and, more importantly, fiscal stimulus. But due to
political opposition from the right, government spending, and thus
economic growth, has been crippled by economic austerity. Austerity is
argued to reduce budget deficits, which will lower interest rates and
inspire business and consumer confidence. But austerity has a
demonstrably weak track record, as the world's largest economies
continue to stagnate even after cuts to government spending.

Without spending on programs that directly create jobs, there will be no
demand for the loans incentivized by central banks. With weak demand and
still-damaged business and consumer balance sheets, flooding the economy
with credit will have minimal effects on growth. What needs to happen to
stimulate a worldwide recovery is increased government spending on a
scale similar to that provided by the world's central banks. Industrial
policy that targets strategic investments such as infrastructure, green
energy, and public transportation can boost growth by directly providing
funds for investment and hiring.

Governments could also guarantee employment to unemployed workers.
Instead of paying workers not to work through unemployment insurance,
governments could directly hire workers in economically and socially
productive sectors. If this sounds infeasible, consider that during the
Great Depression, the U.S. government largely solved the unemployment
problem while improving the country's infrastructure by funding programs
such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress
Administration. In addition, the government became a de facto employer
of last resort during World War II, lowering unemployment under 2
percent and generating massive growth, not only during the war, but in
subsequent years as well. By lowering unemployment and increasing
incomes, fiscal policy could generate massive increases in spending and
growth.

Governments could also costlessly change laws that would boost growth,
such as making it easier for workers to unionize. Higher union
membership would increase wages, allowing for greater consumption and
growth. Currently, 1 out of every 8 workers belong to a union, and most
of these are concentrated in the public sector. But in the 1950s and
1960s, 1 out of every 3 workers belonged to a union. During this period,
economic growth exceeded 4 percent, compared to the 2.6 percent growth
since 1980.

But why do politicians continue to insist on more austerity and
anti-worker policies? These policies would tilt the balance of power
from the wealthy to workers. And since the wealthy dominate the campaign
finance landscape, essentially buying politicians to implement their
will, politicians will only support policies that will increase their
chances of receiving more money and getting re-elected.

Although pro-wealthy policies increase capital gains, dividends, and
profits in the short-term, they ultimately destroy broad-based
purchasing power, which will lower growth for everyone else in the
long-term. The elite are only concerned with their own gains and their
wealth under business- and finance-friendly policies would be greater
than otherwise.

This [greed]{.underline} has [set the stage for a]{.underline}
**[protracted period]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[[below-normal
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** and secular stagnation. [Such [policies
are inimical to]{.mark} not only a sustainable economic
future]{.underline}, **[but also [an inclusive political
future]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Some economists even think we might be
returning to the era of patrimonial capitalism]{.underline} of the late
19th century.

The [costs of prolonged stagnation are]{.underline}
**[serious]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[stretch beyond
economics]{.underline}**. [[Citizens]{.mark} of slow
growing]{.underline} [economies]{.underline} with wide inequality
[[become]{.underline} **[less trustful]{.underline}**, **[more
xenophobic]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [politics
become]{.underline} **[[more reactionary]{.mark} and
extreme]{.underline}**. [History is a useful guide]{.underline} in
showing us where this can lead. [The rise of [fascist
governments]{.mark} in the]{.underline} 19[30s]{.underline}, [especially
the Nazi's]{.underline} in Germany, [[came in response
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a protracted economic depression and a **[[weak
recovery]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[A new world]{.mark} order [will emerge **in the next
decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Whether it is one of]{.underline}
inclusive, [broad-based growth for all or]{.underline} [exclusive,
unequal growth]{.underline} for a few [will be determined
by]{.underline} the [policies implemented today]{.underline}. It does
not look like the world's dominant policy makers are capable or willing
to see the consequences of their misguided actions.

#### Growth is key to [prevent conflict]{.underline} -- causes countries to grab from neighbors

Growth?" *The New York Times Magazine*, 2/17,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/are-we-doomed-to-slow-growth.html?_r=0>

A key question in economics today is: Does technological advancement,
and the improvement in average people's material conditions that it
creates, continue upward at a steady rate? Or has it already peaked?
It's no small question. [If we have learned **anything**, it is that
[peace, democratic values and]{.mark} even self-reported
[happiness]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[are closely connected with]{.mark}
economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Economies that are
stagnant]{.underline} **[lead to conflict]{.underline}**;
[if]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the pie isn't getting bigger]{.mark}, after
all, [the only way to improve]{.mark} your lot [is to **grab someone
else's slice.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [It's telling to [look at
the]{.mark}]{.underline} current [[presidential
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} through this lens. Bernie [Sanders is
arguing]{.underline} that this **[stagnant]{.underline}**-[pie-stealing
has been going]{.underline} [on]{.underline} for some time, while Donald
[Trump says]{.underline} that [he can keep outsiders away]{.underline}
from our desserts altogether. [In a nation whose politics have long been
characterized by]{.underline} indefatigable [optimism]{.underline} ---
in rhetoric if not in reality --- [it's striking that [no]{.mark}
presidential [candidate]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2016 [[is offering an
expansive, optimistic vision]{.underline}]{.mark} of the future.

#### Economic decline causes global nuclear war 

**Tønnesson 15** -- Stein Tønnesson, Research Professor, Peace Research
Institute Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace Program, Uppsala University,
2015, "Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International
Area Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [[Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} for all sides [but]{.underline}
[asymmetrical or unbalanced dependencies and **[negative trade
expectations]{.mark}**]{.underline} may [generate tensions leading to
trade wars among inter-dependent states that]{.underline} in turn
[[increase]{.mark} the risk of [military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The risk may increase if one
of the interdependent countries is governed by an inward-looking
socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the risk of war
between China and the US should not just be analysed bilaterally but
include their allies and partners. Third party countries could drag
China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context it is of some
comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast Asia (China,
Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated economically through
production networks within a global system of trade and finance
(Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for
war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the
basis of their future expectations]{.underline}. International relations
theory must be supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to
assess the value attributed by national decision-makers to economic
development and their assessments of risks and opportunities. [[If
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} on either side of the Atlantic [begin to
seriously **fear or [anticipate]{.mark} their own nation's
[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline} then [[they]{.mark} may
[blame]{.mark}]{.underline} this on [[external dependence]{.mark},
appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt protectionist policies,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately **[[refuse to be deterred
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** either [**[nuclear arms]{.mark}** or prospects
of socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous [shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions
by a third party -- or against a third party.

Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions [in East Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As
Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. [[The greatest risk is]{.mark} **not**]{.underline} that **[a
territorial dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present
circumstances [but that **[changes in the world economy]{.mark}** alter
those circumstances in ways that render inter-state peace more
precarious]{.underline}. If China and the US fail to rebalance their
financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a trade war could
result, interrupting transnational production networks, provoking social
distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. [This could have
unforeseen consequences in the field of security, [with nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} remaining [the only factor to **protect**]{.mark}
**the world [from Armageddon]{.mark}**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [[Deterrence could **lose**]{.mark} **its
[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}: one of the two [[great powers might
gamble]{.mark} that the other yield in a cyber-war or
conventional]{.underline} limited [war]{.underline}, or third party
countries might engage in conflict with each other, with a view to
obliging Washington or Beijing to intervene.

### Econ\-\--Impact\-\--A2: No War\-\--Bennett

#### They conclude war is likely

**Bennett and Nordstrom 2k --** D Scott Bennett and Timothy Nordstrom,
February 2000, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Proquest

CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we applied arguments about substitutability to the
problem of how economic conditions influence state behavior in
international rivalries. We first developed a general argument about how
substitutability might be handled theoretically and statistically and
then explored how states respond to internal economic problems by
substituting between diversionary behavior and seeking rivalry
termination. [[After conducting]{.underline}]{.mark} a multinomial logit
[[analysis, we found significant support for the application of the
diversionary conflict]{.mark} hypothesis within rivalries; we found that
states experiencing [slower rates of growth]{.mark}]{.underline} in
their per capita GDP [[appear to be **more likely to initiate a
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} against a rival than do states with
higher growth rates. We also found no support for the Blainey targeting
hypothesis; rivals initiated with higher probability against states
without economic problems (consistent with the strategic application of
diversionary conflict theory). We also found that [[diversionary
conflict was a more likely reaction to internal problems than was
rivalry termination]{.underline}]{.mark}; [rivalry termination actually
appeared most likely in the context of good economic
conditions]{.underline} within the rivals. [[The relatively larger
support for externalization in our analysis compared to previous studies
may have been revealed by our more sophisticated
model]{.mark},]{.underline} which allows for the possibility of another
policy choice, namely, rivalry termination; by our focus on rival
states; and by our analysis of economic growth as a precursor to
manifest conflict behavior within states.

### Econ\-\--Impact\-\--A2: No War\-\--Clary

#### Clary relies on "rare events regression", which [biases against]{.underline} wars 

**Allison 12** (Paul, Ph.D., is Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania where he teaches graduate courses in methods and
statistics, "Logistic Regression for Rare Events",
<http://statisticalhorizons.com/logistic-regression-for-rare-events>)

Prompted by a 2001 article by King and Zeng, many researchers worry
about whether they can legitimately use conventional logistic regression
for data in which events are rare. [Although King and Zeng accurately
described the problem and proposed an appropriate solution, **[there are
still a lot of misconceptions]{.mark} about this issue.**]{.underline}

[[The problem is not]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically **[[the rarity of
events,]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather [[the
possibility of a small number of cases on the rarer of the two
outcomes.]{.underline}]{.mark} [If you have a sample size of 1000 but
only 20 events, you have a problem. If you have a sample size of 10,000
with 200 events, you may be OK. If your sample has 100,000 cases with
2000 events, you're golden.]{.underline}

There's nothing wrong with the logistic model in such cases. The problem
is that maximum likelihood estimation of the logistic model is
well-known to suffer from small-sample bias. And the degree of bias is
strongly dependent on the number of cases in the less frequent of the
two categories. So **[[even with a sample size of 100,000, if there are
only 20 events in the sample, you may have substantial
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Comprehensive analysis [including]{.underline} Rare Events Regression, finds econ decline increases the [worst]{.underline} conflicts

**Tir 10** (Jaroslav, PhD, professor of political science at University
of Colorado at Boulder, "Territorial Diversion: Diversionary Theory of
War and Territorial Conflict," The Journal of Politics, Vol. 72, No. 2,
April 2010, pp. 413--425)

Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable
but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These [[results
suggest]{.mark} that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond
with territorial diversions to direct signs of their
unpopularity]{.underline} (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) [than to
general background conditions such as economic malaise.]{.underline}
Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions
while ﬁxing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy
effort. **[[Bad economic conditions]{.mark} seem to [motivate]{.mark}
only [the most serious, fatal]{.mark} territorial
[confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This implies that leaders may be
reserving the most high-proﬁle and risky diversions for the times when
they are the most desperate, that is [[when]{.mark} their [power is
threatened]{.mark} both [by]{.mark} signs of [discontent]{.mark} with
their rule [and]{.mark} by more [systemic]{.mark} problems plaguing the
country [(i.e., an underperforming economy).]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Next, I conduct a series of [follow-up tests]{.mark}]{.underline}
suggested by an anonymous Reviewer; results based on the reanalysis of
Model 1 are presented in the online appendix. [Evaluating the
implication that territorial diversions]{.underline} are indeed **[more
likely to result from diversionary conditions than nonterritorial
diversions]{.underline}**, I set up a multinomial logit model that
contrasts the initiation of territorial MIDs versus nonterritorial MIDs
(base outcome). The results show a positive and statistically signiﬁcant
coefﬁcient for the government unpopularity variable (ﬁrst column of
Table 3), meaning that higher levels of government unpopularity are more
likely to produce territorial rather than nonterritorial MIDs. [Further
checks]{.underline} **[[include]{.mark} performing [rare events
logit]{.mark}]{.underline}** (King and Zeng 2001) **[[and
population-averaged logit analyses to verify whether]{.mark} the rare
events nature of [the dependent variable]{.mark} or cross-sectional
characteristics of the data [alter the ﬁndings]{.mark},
respectively]{.underline}**. [[The ﬁndings]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the
two independent variables]{.underline} **[[remain
unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Table 3, columns two and three).
Finally, protesting behavior in more populous countries could be
considered more ''normal'' and less threatening to the government,
potentially lowering the incentive to divert. Dividing the government
unpopularity variable by the log of country's population (from the
Correlates of War National Capabilities data set, Singer 1987) reveals
that the population size-standardized government unpopularity variable
remains positive and signiﬁcant; see Table 3, ﬁnal column.

Concerning the control variables, the effects of power and distance are
consistent with expectations and across the Models in Table 1.
Democracy, alliance ties, and trade coefﬁcients have mostly the expected
dampening inﬂuence on territorial conﬂict initiation; but only trade
exhibits a signiﬁcant impact and only when the dependent variable is the
fatal territorial MID (i.e., in Models 3--4). 16 These results are
somewhat surprising, but the reader is reminded that the effects of
alliance are highly contested (see Maoz 2000), while the impact of trade
has not been established in the domain of territorial conﬂict.
Similarly, recent research shows that the [democratic peace weakens
considerably in the context of territorial conﬂict]{.underline} (James,
Park, and Choi 2006) [and that the democratic peace may be epiphenomenal
to territorial peace]{.underline} (Gibler 2007). [17 Importantly, the
control variable results imply that some of the related
interests]{.underline} (e.g., security, regime ties) [may indeed be
subordinated to the territorial diversion impetus.]{.underline}

[Revisiting the link between regime type and diversion, some scholars
argue that democratic leaders have a greater
motivation]{.underline}---due to the need for popular support---[for
diversion]{.underline} (e.g., Gelpi 1997; Russett 1990; Smith 1996).
[Yet, others]{.underline} (e.g., Downs and Rocke 1994; Miller 1995;
Pickering and Kisangani 2005) [assert that authoritarian leaders need
popular support in order to appear legitimate.]{.underline} Because they
cannot derive legitimacy from democratic institutions and elections,
they look to diversions to help them achieve this goal. Autocrats can
also divert with greater impunity due to the lack of institutional
checks and balances. In follow-up tests available from the online
appendix, Table 4, I restrict the set of initiator countries in Model 1
to democracies only, autocracies only, all nondemocracies, and all
nonautocracies. That [the [ﬁndings]{.mark} hold [suggest]{.mark}s **that
[both democratic and autocratic leaders value territorial
diversions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, resolving the broader
debate is beyond the scope of this study.

### Econ\-\--Impact\-\--A2: No War\-\--Drezner

#### He's wrong

**Cohen 15 --** Benjamin J. Cohen, Louis G. Lancaster Professor of
International Political Economy at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, Perspectives on Politics, Volume 13, Issue 2, June 2015, Review
"The System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression", pp.
586-587

The second question is handled similarly. [[Drezner acknowledges]{.mark}
that the policies hastily enacted to combat the crisis were anything but
optimal]{.underline}. By that measure, [our governing
[institutions]{.mark} might be expected to [deserve a failing
grade]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But that, he asserts, is an "absurd
standard to apply. \... The question is not whether global governance
has been flawless but whether it has been good enough]{.underline}" (p.
15). [In effect]{.underline}, therefore, [any minimal]{.underline}
amount of [achievement should be regarded a success]{.underline}. On
this view, a grade of D is as good as an A. They all "work."

[In fact, [a realistic grade would]{.mark} be [closer to D than
A]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Yes, as Drezner demonstrates, powerful
interests went to work to maintain the openness of the trading
system]{.underline}. Yes, the United States turned out to have the power
to exercise a degree of leadership. And yes, there was no serious
challenge to prevailing neoliberal norms. [But [on balance,
protectionist measures did proliferate, mainly]{.mark} in the form of
["behind-the-border"]{.mark} nontariff [barriers. Many
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}, most notably the authorities in
Berlin, stubbornly [[resisted]{.mark} American calls for greater
[stimulus]{.mark}. And some less market-friendly ideas did begin to gain
legitimacy, such as a newfound respect for capital
controls]{.underline}. [If the system "worked," it did so barely enough
to pass.]{.underline} It seems almost unseemly to boast about what is at
best a gentleman's C.

[below the 3 to 4 percent that was commonplace in the second half of the
20th century]{.underline}. [**That means [there is less of a]{.mark}
growth [cushion]{.mark}**[. **It takes a smaller**]{.mark} **negative
[shock to pull the economy into contraction]{.mark}
territory**]{.underline}.

Second, [the Fed may find itself with less room to reduce the damage of
the next downturn]{.underline}. [In modern recessions, the central bank
has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percent]{.underline}, according to
research by the Fed economist David Reifschneider. [With rates below 0.5
percent]{.underline} and on track to rise very slowly, [**[any small
shock]{.mark} in the next few years [could cause major]{.mark} economic
[damage]{.mark}**, especially [if the Fed's]{.mark} less conventional
monetary policy [tools]{.mark} either [go unused or don't prove
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Econ's fragile

**Hansen, 16** -- Steven Hansen, international business and industrial
consultant, 3-26-2016, "The Economy Keeps Stumbling Along", Seeking
Alpha,
<http://seekingalpha.com/article/3961069-economy-keeps-stumbling-along>

Once a month, I assemble an economic forecast based on analysis of
various data points which have led the economy. Historically, most of
the time the economy trends up or trends down - but [recently the
[econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline} simply [[has been **frozen** with **little
change** in]{.mark} the rate of [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. [My
view]{.underline} of the economy [is at Main Street level -
not]{.underline} necessarily [GDP]{.underline}. My position is that
[[GDP has **disconnected** from the real economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
thinking person might say that GDP never projected the real economy -
and it was never more obvious with the current situation where rate of
change of growth slowed to a crawl. The jumping around of GDP in a flat
economy is noticeable. We will be releasing [[our]{.mark} economic
[forecast]{.mark}]{.underline} next week - and [[conditions have]{.mark}
been flat ([near]{.mark} the **[zero growth]{.mark}** line) [for]{.mark}
**three [months]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [All
indicators]{.underline}]{.mark} I view outside the elements of our
forecast [[are mixed]{.mark} and confused. **[Nothing is
strong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [One of my favorite indicators to
understand]{.underline} if the rate of economic [growth is]{.underline}
accelerating or decelerating is the [[relationship between]{.mark}
the]{.underline} year-over-year [growth rate of]{.underline} non-farm
private [[employment and]{.underline}]{.mark} the year-over-year real
growth rate of [[retail]{.mark} sales]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
index [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[showing **no**]{.mark}
**growth [differential]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [When retail sales grow
faster than]{.underline} the rate of [employment]{.underline} gains
(above zero on the below graph) - the rate of growth of [the economy is
usually accelerating]{.underline}.

### New Mod\-\--Dollar Heg

#### Debt deal failure kills the [dollar]{.underline}

**Sherman 4/30** \-\-\-- Erik, contributor to *Forbes*, *NBC News*, and
*Fortune*, "\'Debt Ceiling\' May Become a Political Buzzword This
Summer," *Fortune*, 2019,
http://fortune.com/2019/04/30/debt-ceiling-economy-politics/

[[Without an increase in the]{.mark} debt [ceiling, the]{.mark}
U.S]{.underline}. **[cannot borrow more]{.underline}**. "At some point,
[programs get affected," said]{.underline} Stuart
[Greenbaum]{.underline}, retired dean of the Olin Business School at
Washington University. ["They cut back here, they cut back there on
spending." And some debts don't get paid,]{.underline} **[putting the
U.S. into default]{.underline}**.

There are two major parts to the [[danger]{.underline}]{.mark}. One [[is
the]{.underline} **[dominance of the dollar]{.underline}** [as a
standard currency and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[critical [part of
the]{.mark} global [economy's foundation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as the
**universally recognized**]{.underline} [store of value---the instrument
of]{.underline} ]{.mark}[exchange and [financial safety]{.mark}. The
U.S. dollar has been the one trustworthy constant in a sea of change.
The [consequences of]{.mark} a [default is **unimaginably
bad.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[["The analogy]{.underline}]{.mark} that [somebody [used was]{.mark} it
was like [asking]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[what]{.mark} happened [if
every nuc]{.mark}lear warhead [went
off]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---[whether you got]{.underline}]{.mark}
[\[only\] [massive destruction **or the end of
everything,"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[said Kumar]{.underline}]{.mark},
who was involved in the negotiations during the 2011 debt crisis.

"[Eventually, [you can get a run]{.mark} on the dollar," Greenbaum said.
[The value]{.mark} of the dollar [would
**plummet**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[taking with
it]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the [stability of international
trade]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} untold amounts of perceived
[value]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Dollar collapse causes U.S. isolationism, global economic collapse, and nuclear war

**Mandelbaum 8** (Michael, Professor of Foreign Policy -- Johns Hopkins
University, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts as the World's
Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 224)

If closer scrutiny does turn the public against the American role as the
world's government---[if]{.underline} mounting domestic obligations or
[a major, traumatic event]{.underline} or series of events [such as the
**[collapse of the dollar]{.mark}**]{.underline} or a terrorist attack
even more deadly than those of September 11 [[should cause]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[to
decrease dramatically]{.mark} the scope of [its international
activities]{.mark}---the world would become]{.underline} a messier,
[more dangerous, and less prosperous]{.underline} place. At best, an
[American [withdrawal would]{.mark}]{.underline} bring with it some of
the political anxiety typical during the Cold War and a measure of the
economic uncertainty that characterized the years before World War II.
At worst, the retreat of American power could [[lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a repetition of the [great [**global economic
failure** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[bloody [international
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** the world experienced in the 1930s and
1940s. Indeed, the [[potential for]{.mark} economic calamity and wartime
[destruction is **great**]{.mark}]{.underline}er at the outset of the
new century than it was in the first half of the preceding one [[because
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the greater extent of international economic
[interdependence and]{.underline} the higher levels of
prosperity---there is more to lose now than there was then---and because
of the [[presence]{.underline}]{.mark}, in large numbers, [[of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\
[[Deterring]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[great powers]{.mark}, such as
Russia and China, [will require]{.mark} Washington to
maintain]{.underline} its [[dominance]{.mark} in conventional
warfare]{.underline} and therefore at least to maintain its current
level of military spending. But in addition, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [now
[faces]{.mark}]{.underline} three new types of threats for which its
existing military capacity is either ill suited or insufficient. First,
there are relatively small [[regional powers,]{.mark} such as [North
Korea, Iran, and Pakistan]{.mark}, that can]{.underline} or will soon be
able to [strike the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and]{.underline} its [allies with]{.underline} weapons of mass
destruction ([[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}). Second, [there are
global]{.underline} nonstate [[terrorist networks]{.underline}]{.mark},
such as al Qaeda, with visions of re-creating the world order. And
third, there are independent terrorists and groups motivated less by a
long-term vision of global conquest than by hatred, anti-Americanism,
and opposition to their own governments. Each of these threats is
exacerbated by the relative ease with which crude WMDs can be developed
due to the diffusion of modern technology and the potential emergence of
a black market in fissile material. Furthermore, there seems to be
general agreement that the United States has committed so much of its
war-fighting capacity to Iraq and Afghanistan that it could not fight in
Iran or North Korea or elsewhere if that were deemed necessary. That
**[[limit on capacity encourages]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S.
**[[adversaries to behave in ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are
[**[contrary to U.S. interests]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Those
[[adversaries would be less likely to do so if Washington
had]{.underline}]{.mark} the [extra [\[hu\]manpower]{.mark}]{.underline}
and equipment that were once assumed to be the goal \-- and perhaps the
reality \-- of the U.S. military structure.

[The]{.underline} **[threat]{.underline}** [of

spending deal to avert more than \$300 billion of spending reductions
imposed by the Budget Control Act, but no progress has been made. The
president himself recently scorned the idea of a budget deal, tweeting
that a spending deal is "not happening!"

[The [2020 sequester would be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[twice as large

[[Pelosi's concern is]{.underline}]{.mark} that an
[[impeachment]{.underline}]{.mark} proceeding [[in the House would
"allow Trump to **play it off as a reality show**]{.mark} **event**,"
Kane said.]{.underline}

[If the House votes to impeach Trump, there would be a trial [in the
Senate]{.mark}, where the **[Republicans hold a]{.mark} 53-47
[majority]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

["They]{.underline} **[know]{.underline}** [[the **Senate is going

have]{.mark} essentially [a symbolic rebuke]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
president **[[that wouldn\'t go anywhere]{.mark} in terms of actually
removing him from office]{.underline}**, [and politically it might not
be very good for Democrats]{.underline} either," [he said.]{.underline}

And so, at the moment, Kane said, [Pelosi's challenge is that [the
country is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not persuaded]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that [impeachment is needed [and there are
**doubts**]{.mark}]{.underline} [about]{.underline} [[whether
there's]{.mark} enough of [a case]{.mark} for Democrats to
make.]{.underline}

["She keeps saying [this has to be]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[overwhelmingly]{.underline}]{.mark}** compelling case," [Kane said.
"Right now, [it is]{.mark} a]{.underline} case in which the underlying
[crime of [collusion]{.mark} with Russians]{.underline} in 2016 was
**[left [unsettled]{.mark}, not a provable case]{.underline}**, [as
Mueller says. The [obstruction]{.mark} case [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
there, but it\'s **[[not fully defined]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
it\'s going to take **an incredible effort**]{.underline} [to fully lay
the case out]{.underline} to the public, and convince them that this is
a truly impeachable offense that could involve removal from office."

[[There are]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}**
[questions]{.underline}]{.mark} [about [whether the House]{.mark}
Judiciary [Committee is "capable]{.mark}]{.underline} of really
prosecuting the case, and turning public opinion \... in a way that
would make Pelosi comfortable politically moving toward impeachment,"
Kane said.

"These Democrats on Judiciary, [they\'re smart]{.underline} people,
**[but [they\'ve never had]{.mark} to do [this
before]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \[Committee Chairman\] Jerry [[Nadler

[A new report from the New York Times Magazine goes behind the scenes of
the VP selection]{.underline} process and claims that Trump\'s first
choice was his former rival, Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Perhaps more
interestingly, [the report sheds light on the unprecedented level of
power Trump plans to delegate to his vice president if
elected]{.underline}. According to the Times, [Trump\'s son, Donald
[**Trump Jr., was responsible for vetting**]{.mark} the potential
candidates. Here\'s a scene from one conservation he had with a Kasich
adviser. Did he have any interest in being the most powerful vice
president in history?]{.underline} When Kasich's adviser asked how this
would be the case, [[Donald Jr. explained]{.mark} that [his father's
vice president would be in charge of **domestic and foreign
policy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Then [[what]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
adviser asked, [[would Trump be in charge of?]{.mark} \"[Making America
great again]{.mark}\" was the casual reply.]{.underline} If true, this
means that [[Trump doesn\'t plan on doing much governing at
all]{.underline}]{.mark}. It may also reveal [that [he]{.mark} actually
[agrees with]{.mark} Hillary [Clinton\'s claim]{.mark} that [he is
temperamentally unfit]{.mark}]{.underline} to become president of the
United States. As for Kasich, he declined the offer and isn\'t even
showing up to the Republican convention that\'s taking place in his home
state.

foreign policy is the realism America needs,"
<http://nypost.com/2016/04/29/trumps-foreign-policy-is-the-realism-america-needs/>)

[Despite]{.underline} Republican presidential candidate Donald
[[Trump's]{.mark} reality-show candidacy, **his [recent]{.mark}
[fo]{.mark}reign-[po]{.mark}licy [speech]{.mark} [put forth a realistic
view]{.mark} of the world and a [largely credible]{.mark} foreign policy
to face it.**]{.underline} Continuing his poke at the political
establishment, [the]{.underline} maverick [candidate proposed [a viable
alt]{.mark}ernative [to]{.mark} the [bipart]{.mark}isan foreign-policy
[consensus]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} uses unneeded and [profligate]{.mark}
**military [interventions]{.mark} overseas as the primary US
foreign-policy tool.** As [opposed to]{.mark} the interventionist
neoconservatism of the Bush administration and the **equally meddling
liberal [hawkish]{.mark}ness of**]{.underline} Hillary
[**[Clinton]{.mark}**, Trump got back to basics in this week's speech.
He let American citizens know his foreign policy would safeguard US
national interests first --- not those of foreign countries, including
providing for their security while they freeload]{.underline}. He
laudably said [military [intervention]{.mark} would be used
**[only]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a last resort, [**[after diplomacy
and]{.mark} economic [sanctions]{.mark}** --- and even the latter would
be used sparingly]{.underline}. [Rather than using military power in a
vain attempt to export democracy by force]{.underline} into countries
that are unreceptive to it, [as the United States did in Iraq and Libya,
Trump said America should promote its values through **leading by
example**. **This is smart, practical policy.** Democracy takes root
when people]{.underline} in a country [support it, rather than having it
shoved down their throats]{.underline} at gunpoint. [**In only four out
of 18 attempts since 1900 has the forcible US export of democracy
succeeded.** In contrast, at the end of the Cold War the United States
inspired the countries of Eastern and Central Europe to democratize from
their communist past. Both]{.underline} the [[Bush and
Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administrations [[tried to impose]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark} on other nations --- Iraq and Libya]{.underline},
respectively --- [**using military power and nation-building, and we are
now stuck bandaging the resulting hemorrhages. This interventionist
approach [sparked]{.mark} [chaos in the Middle East]{.mark} [and
allowed]{.mark}** the terror group **[ISIS]{.mark} to fill the vacuum.
Trump sees this reality and is right to commit his presidency to a more
restrained, prudent approach to foreign intervention**]{.underline}.
Echoing the traditional, less-interventionist US foreign policy that was
the norm before the Cold War, [Trump affirmed the United States would
"not go in search of enemies." This more restrained foreign policy
served the nation well from its birth in the late 1700s to 1947, when it
began to police the world]{.underline}.

people are gone." In a real sense, [this]{.underline} town [exists
to]{.underline} [serve the liberal, constitutional order]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} President [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[face]{.underline} **[fierce]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}
**[sustained]{.underline}** **[resistance]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} his "[because I say so"

[from]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[the other party]{.underline}**]{.mark}
but **[from [his own]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[from]{.underline}**
the **[[nonpartisan civil servants]{.underline}]{.mark}** [who run the
government]{.underline} day to day.¶ [Should he try to make good
on]{.underline} his most [controversial promises]{.underline}, [he'd
find]{.underline}, as President Obama has, that **[[the

with injunctions]{.underline} that there is no way around.
**[[Congress]{.mark} would [have to]{.mark} agree to

**[[indefinitely]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶ The most reliable action to
block those [Trump proposals]{.underline} that so many in both parties
find [unconstitutional]{.underline} would [come from the

[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[from walking away from]{.underline} [international norms and treaty
obligations]{.underline}. A flurry of [lawsuits]{.underline} [would
surely answer Trump's opening gambit]{.underline}, and injunctions could
jam, say, an executive order on "extreme vetting." [[Trump
could]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise [[order]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[we cut]{.mark} our contribution to [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
because [that]{.underline}, [like [NAFTA]{.mark}, [involves a

would be [[challenged in court]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ "There really is
no way to stop him from issuing a whole series of unconstitutional and
illegal orders and rolling the dice," says Leon Panetta, who served in
Congress, as CIA director and defense secretary under Obama, and as
President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff. "But they would be
immediately contested in court."¶ Panetta added: "I can't think of one
thing he's recommended that, without some serious compromise on his
part, would be enacted. [No matter which way he turns, [he's going to
run into a wall]{.mark}]{.underline} --- not one that he's built, but
the one that's been [in place since the beginning of the
republic."]{.underline} [The Constitution]{.underline}, in other words.

#### Congress and Constitution checks

**Ferguson 16**. \[Niall, professor of history at Harvard and a senior
fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford, \"Keep calm --- the
Constitution will constrain Trump\" Boston Globe \--
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/05/08/keep-calm-constitution-will-constrain-trump/vb06y2Q2O5khvkZKdHl7pI/story.html>\]

[The]{.underline} only half-decent [argument for [keep]{.mark}ing
[calm]{.mark} is that [the Constitution]{.mark} was purpose-built to
[constrain]{.mark} a man like [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To see why
the separation of powers still matters, just consider what Trump says he
is going to do if he wins]{.underline}. [By the end of his first 100
days as president, Trump assured]{.underline} The New York Times
recently, [[his]{.mark} [wall]{.mark} along the Mexican border would be
designed and his blanket [ban on Muslim immigration]{.mark} would be in
place]{.underline}. On Day 1, those American [companies that have the
temerity to employ people abroad would be threatened with punitive
fines]{.underline}. Finally, Trump would impose [an across-the-board
[tariff on Chinese imports]{.mark}]{.underline}. "We can't continue to
allow China to rape our country," he declared at a rally last weekend.
Now for **[the good news. [He can do]{.mark} almost [none of this if
Congress opposes him]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to the
Constitution (Article I, Section 8), it is not the president but
Congress that has the power to regulate immigration, taxation, and
trade. The president's principal power lies in his being commander in
chief of the armed forces. Even his right to make treaties is
conditional on "the advice and consent" of the Senate. In short, [[the
Donald's]{.underline}]{.mark} antiglobalization [[program]{.mark}
[depends on]{.mark} his being able to muster majorities in
[Congress]{.mark}.]{.underline} How easy is that going to be when the
speaker of the House --- a Republican --- can't bring himself to endorse
Trump and the Democrats stand a good chance of retaking the Senate?

All of which is nuts. [[Trump isn't Hitler]{.mark}. [He isn't]{.mark} [a
fascist]{.mark} either]{.underline}---although he has, despite a career
of deal-making, the my-way-or-the-highway proclivities of a Latin
American strongman, which would be worrisome if America were Bolivia and
not an enduring democracy. (Trump was the inspiration, by the way, for
the Back to the Future bully, Biff Tannen.) He's also not a savior. Due
to his solipsistic personality and vague, unworkable policies, he could
never be what he promises to be if elected. But that doesn't make him
the sum of all fears. [[The unspectacular truth]{.mark} [is]{.mark} that
a [Trump]{.mark} presidency [would]{.mark} probably [be marked
by]{.mark} the [quotidian work of]{.mark} so many [other]{.mark}
[presidents]{.mark}]{.underline}---trying to sell Congress and the
public on proposals while fighting off not only a culture of protest but
also the usual swarm of lobbyists who kill any interesting idea with ads
and donations. Trump has a rarefied confidence in his abilities and, as
we recently learned, in his, um, manhood. But **[what he doesn't have is
a magic wand]{.underline}** (insert wand-penis joke here). Remember
Schoolhouse Rock ? **[[Trump is no match for]{.mark} the American
[political system]{.mark}, [with its three branches]{.mark} of
government]{.underline}**. [[The president]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
famed political scientist Richard Neustadt once said, [[has to take an
inherently weak position]{.underline}]{.mark} and use the powers of

Agencies On Iran Deal and Muslim Ban, Adviser Says\" Wall Street Journal
\--
blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/06/08/trump-will-consult-congress-agencies-on-iran-deal-and-muslim-ban-adviser-says/\]

Presumptive Republican White House nominee Donald [[Trump would]{.mark}
[consult]{.mark} with [Congress]{.mark} [and]{.mark} federal
[agencies]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a number of his signature [fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy [initiatives]{.mark}, including reworking a nuclear deal
with Iran and a proposed ban on the entry of Muslims]{.underline} into
the U.S., a top adviser said Wednesday. Walid [Phares, one of Mr.
Trump's senior foreign policy advisers, said [the candidate
would]{.mark} [seek]{.mark} domestic and international
"**[consensus]{.mark}**" on a range of foreign policy
initiatives]{.underline}. During an hour-long interview with Wall Street
Journal reporters and editors, Mr. [Phares offered nuance to a number of
Mr. [Trump's]{.mark} foreign policy [ideas]{.mark}, suggesting some
[aren't]{.mark} [set in stone]{.mark} [and could be **modified**]{.mark}
as the campaign progresses.]{.underline} For example, Mr. Trump has
called a recent nuclear deal with Iran "terrible" and "horrible" but Mr.
Phares said Mr. Trump wouldn't immediately attempt to negate it once in
office. "He is going to be revising, reviewing, and maybe trying to
modify the Iran deal," Mr. Phares said. One option, he said, would be to
resubmit the deal -- or something like it -- to Congress for a vote, a
process whose outcome would depend on the makeup of Congress next year.
Many bankers are watching the U.S. election closely and waiting for a
clearer understanding of future U.S. policy towards Iran before doing
business with the country. Mr. Phares's suggestion Mr. Trump would
revise the agreement instead of completely voiding it could influence
the way some financial institutions deal with companies in Iran seeking
access to global markets. Similarly, Mr. Phares said Mr. Trump would
consult with immigration, national security, law enforcement, and other
officials before proceeding with his proposed temporary ban on the entry
of Muslims into the U.S. "His position which was strong -- in terms of
the ban -- was based on the fact that the Obama administration --- the
Obama-Clinton administration --- for the last seven to eight years was
not able to equip us with systems by which we were able to identify the
jihadists," he said. Mr. Trump has faced criticism for his foreign
policy platform, which breaks from GOP orthodoxy. Mr. Phares said Mr.
Trump's worldview doesn't fit neatly into traditional labels of
"isolationalist" or "interventionalist." Rather, he described Mr. Trump
as a "functionalist" who would work with allies when necessary but not
overextend the U.S. in matters in which there isn't an American
interest. He also said that [many of Mr. Trump's proposals so far have
only been offered as single ideas]{.underline}, which he compared to
pieces of a puzzle. Once more proposals are set forward, something Mr.
Phares predicted would happen soon, a broader approach to foreign policy
would become clear, he said. "The expectation is the more she's going to
attack, the more he's going to respond, and if he's going to respond, he
most likely he will address these issues," Mr. Phares said, referring to
Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. One
key challenge for any Trump administration would be building bridges
with Arab countries, many of which have been alarmed by some of Mr.
Trump's proposals so far. Mr. Phares said he is interviewed by Arab
media outlets at least once a day, and works to explain Mr. Trump's
approach to the region. He predicted that numerous countries would be
relieved to have a fresh start with the White House next year following
several years of frosty relations with the Obama administration. Mr.
Phares dismissed the caricature of Mr. Trump that Mrs. Clinton has
worked hard to describe, suggesting, for instance, that he would rush
into a nuclear conflict if his feelings get hurt or if another country
insults him. "[[I don't see an unusual Trump
presidency]{.underline}]{.mark} as Madame Clinton is explaining
[[where]{.mark}]{.underline} he's going to go ~~crazy~~ [and start
[pressing]{.mark} [buttons right away]{.mark}," Mr. Phares
said]{.underline}, tapping on the table. "**[That's not going to happen.
[We have a]{.mark} [rational institution here]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

Retired [General]{.underline} Mike [Hayden]{.underline} [created a
stir]{.underline} with his recent appearance on the HBO show, "Real Time
with Bill Maher." In the interview, [Hayden told Maher that [if]{.mark}
Donald [Trump]{.mark} [wins]{.mark} the election [and]{.mark} then
[attempts]{.mark} to fulfill some of his more [outlandish]{.mark}
[campaign promises]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} new Republican **[president
would be blocked by]{.mark} the [senior military]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Actually what Hayden said was, "**[the American [armed forces]{.mark}
[would refuse]{.mark} to act]{.underline}**" and that [the senior
military will be correct in doing so [because]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
he put it, **[military [commanders]{.mark}, "[are required]{.mark} [not
to follow]{.mark} an [unlawful order]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

In response to this, Maher offered a typical sardonic response, joking
that Hayden had offered, "a good reason not to support Trump" because
were he to instruct the military to do those things, "there would be a
coup in this country."

But jokes aside, Maher's interview with Hayden raises some interesting
and important issues here for civil-military relations. And given
Trump's standing as the Republican front-runner, this is also not merely
an academic exercise.

Let's begin by imposing a bit of precision on the analysis.

General Hayden was talking about some very particular campaign promises
by Trump, specifically that as president he would a) direct the military
to intentionally target the families of terrorists to be killed, and b)
direct the national security establishment to do a "hell of a lot worse"
than water-boarding to the terrorists and families of terrorists that
are captured on Trump's watch.

Both of [these proposed policies are clear violations of the
law]{.underline}. Civilian deaths that occur as collateral damage
incidental to strikes aimed at legitimate targets are always avoided but
sometimes an unfortunate part of lawful warfare; [Trump is talking about
deliberately targeting the family members as a matter of
policy]{.underline}. [I do not know of a single law expert who would say
this is legal.]{.underline}

[On the second one]{.underline}, there was a debate among reasonable
lawyers about whether the Enhanced Interrogation Techniques ([EIT)
program launched by the Bush Administration in the wake of the 9/11
attacks]{.underline}, [and then rolled back]{.underline} in the second
term in the face of public pressure and adverse court rulings, were
legal at the time. But [that program was much more narrowly
circumscribed than what Trump is talking about]{.underline} --indeed, he
explicitly says he wants to do "a hell of a lot worse" than what was
done in that program. And note: [last October, Congress passed
provisions in the 2016 Defense Authorization Act that make waterboarding
and other techniques Trump wants to go way past explicitly
illegal]{.underline}. There simply would not be much of a debate about
Trump's proposals. **[The overwhelming consensus would be that it is
illegal.]{.underline}**

I suppose it would get especially tricky --- and this is the thorniest
part of the EIT saga --- if some the government lawyers disagreed. There
is no chance the military lawyers would accept Trump's line of
reasoning, but it is possible he could appoint some civilian lawyers
that might back his case. This would provoke a massive legal fight
inside the administration, one that makes the Bush administration's
debates over EIT and the NSA's terrorist surveillance program, and the
Obama administration's debates over drone strikes against American
citizens who have joined al Qaeda, pale in comparison. Every expert I
have talked to has reached the same conclusion: **[[Trump]{.mark} (and
any lawyers he could find) [would]{.mark} likely [lose the case]{.mark}
and the military would rightly see the orders as illegal.]{.underline}**

Given that it would be illegal orders, **[General Hayden is absolutely
correct: not only would the senior military leaders refuse to follow
those orders,]{.underline}** **[[they would be]{.mark} [legally and
professionally bound]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to refuse]{.mark} those
orders. Democratic civil-military relations theory further requires that
they refuse these orders. **Refusing these orders would [not be a
coup]{.mark}. It would be [reinforcing]{.mark} the [rule of law
and]{.mark} healthy [c]{.mark}ivil-[m]{.mark}ilitary
[r]{.mark}elations.**]{.underline}

[[Watching]{.underline}]{.mark} the dynamics of the
[[relations]{.underline}]{.mark}hip [[between the administration
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} at this
point, [[and listening to]{.underline}]{.mark} some [administration
[officials]{.mark}]{.underline} talk, [I can't shake the sense
that]{.underline} **[[real trouble might be coming]{.mark} in the
fall]{.underline}**, [[when]{.mark} federal [borrowing]{.mark} again
[hits the debt ceiling.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Technically, the debt ceiling was already reached three months ago, but
the Treasury has the ability to move money around to hold off the need
for action until some time in October. (Here are some useful details
from the Congressional Budget Office on how that works.) This has
happened over and over for years, of course, and each time Congress and
the president have acted before the deadline. [[Given]{.mark} the
[implications]{.mark} of failing]{.underline} to do that, [[it's
reasonable to assume they will act]{.mark} again]{.underline}.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** [two distinct kinds of **political
[dynamics are]{.mark} a little [more disconcerting]{.mark} this
time.**]{.underline}

First, the [[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} in the House [[have fallen
into]{.mark} a **legislative pattern**]{.underline} [by
which]{.underline} basically **[all they are really doing]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} organized by [[opposition]{.mark} to the president.
Mostly that means oversight]{.underline}. And [[since the
admin]{.mark}istration [is **not cooperating**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
their oversight efforts, [these [efforts are **increasingly
aggressive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} yet also
**[increasingly [performative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Oversight is
important, and the Trump administration is giving them no shortage of
targets. But [the [predominance of]{.mark} such
[oversight]{.mark}]{.underline} work [[creates habits]{.mark} **[that
could make it difficult]{.mark} for the Democrats [to advance a
debt]{.mark}-ceiling [increase without
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Beyond oversight, they are
passing]{.underline}]{.mark} **[largely
[symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [party-positioning
[bills]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [these **reinforce that same
pattern**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Obviously, [[there is an analogy]{.underline}]{.mark} here
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the behavior of [House Republicans
after]{.underline} the [[2010]{.underline}]{.mark} elections. It is one
of many such analogies lately. Nancy Pelosi has so far kept better order
in her caucus than John Boehner did in that period, and it's a little
easier to imagine her forcing her members to swallow a clean
debt-ceiling vote than it was to see Boehner doing it back then. But I
actually think that [on the whole [Pelosi]{.mark} **[may be
weaker]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not stronger, [now than Boehner was
then]{.underline}. And [in any case, as things stand right now House
[Democrats could be facing]{.mark} some **[real trouble]{.mark}** on
that front.]{.underline}

And second, [[there is talk]{.mark} among]{.underline} some
[administration officials [about]{.mark}]{.underline} various approaches
to the ["[prioritization]{.mark}" of key]{.underline} debt
[payments]{.underline}---so that even in the absence of an increase in
the debt ceiling, the Treasury could still pay creditors by delaying
payments of other obligations or contracts. [This would make breaching
the debt ceiling less catastrophic]{.underline}, since it would avert an
actual default on U.S. government obligations. But a less catastrophic
breach of the debt ceiling could still be pretty catastrophic,
especially in its effects on economic expectations, which can be
enormously important to the performance of the economy.

This talk of prioritization is itself an old habit from the peak of the
Tea Party era earlier in this decade, and some of the people who were
near the center of the action in that time in Congress are now near the
center of the action in the administration. There is some internal
resistance to this way of thinking about handling debt payments, of
course, and prioritization is certainly not the official position of the
administration at this point. But again, [[we're seeing]{.mark} people
building up [habits that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[will not serve]{.mark}
them [well]{.mark}]{.underline}** [if the deadline comes with no
agreement]{.underline}.

[All this suggests [it will be crucial to avoid]{.mark} a [real]{.mark}
all-out [confrontation]{.mark} on the debt ceiling, [in which each side
would be locked into]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[habits]{.underline}
**[it has]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[built up]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[neither could afford to back down]{.underline}**.
That should mean moving on the debt ceiling well before the deadline is
reached, and looking for any opportunity to take that issue off the
table. [Getting well ahead of it]{.underline} by seeing the problem
coming [is essential]{.underline} to preventing a showdown that neither
party is well equipped to handle at the moment.

[[If you think the president and]{.underline}]{.mark} congressional
[[Democrats are sufficiently self-aware]{.mark} to act in
advance]{.underline} to avert a confrontation, [then [you shouldn't be
worried]{.mark}]{.underline} about the debt-ceiling deadline.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if the past few years]{.underline} in
Washington [are any indication]{.underline}, then **[[you probably
should be worried.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The 2020 sequester would be twice as large as the one in 2013, from
which military readiness has still not recovered. As former Secretary of
Defense Jim Mattis noted, "No enemy in the field has done more to harm
the combat readiness of our military than sequestration." A 2020
sequester of defense spending would essentially reverse all the
readiness gains achieved in 2018 and 2019. According to Acting Secretary
of Defense Pat Shanahan, it would represent "the undoing of the National
Defense Strategy." The sequester would cut \$20 billion from the Navy
and \$29 billion from the Air Force, cause the Marine Corps to "stall,"
and halt or disrupt 118 Army programs. According to Gen. Mark Milley,
nominated to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a 2020 sequester would
"place the United States of America at great risk."

**[[Every]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[passing day]{.mark} in which momentum

attractiveness of blaming the other party]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for
failing to achieve one.]{.underline} Negotiations for the last deal

**[Neither]{.underline}** [Republicans]{.underline}

John Yarmuth (pictured) pulled his proposed outline of a spending deal
from floor consideration. While [[Yarmuth's]{.underline}]{.mark}
legislation failed, it illuminated a potential path to reach an
agreement. The [[failure showed]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Democrats]{.mark} acting [alone]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[cannot pass
a]{.mark} spending [deal]{.mark} in the House]{.underline}**. Some
amount of [[offsets or pay-fors will be required]{.mark} to lure
conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans]{.underline} to vote for
the deal.

However, [while [White House officials]{.mark} mock
Yarmuth]{.underline}'s failure, [their own approach]{.underline} to the
negotiations **[[remain]{.mark}s [baffling]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [They
are]{.underline} [**not on the same page** as congress]{.underline}ional
Republicans, who have a reasonable idea of what a spending agreement
might look like, according to the frequent comments of their leadership
and key committee chairs. By contrast, [[the White House's]{.underline}
**[d]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ead-[o]{.mark}n-[a]{.mark}rrival]{.underline}**
budget [[proposal revealed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration **[[does not]{.mark} even [want a
deal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Currently, [the White House favors
a]{.underline} full-year **[c]{.underline}**ontinuing
**[r]{.underline}**esolution, [which]{.underline} **[would trigger
sequestration]{.underline}** in 2020.

**[In addition to their internal divisions]{.underline}**,
[[both]{.underline}]{.mark} parties [[appear]{.underline} **[unwilling

[[shutdown]{.underline}]{.mark}. Discussions of a normally
uncontroversial [[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark} aid bill remain
**[[stalled]{.underline}]{.mark}**, due to disagreements over the amount
of relief for Puerto Rico and flood-affected Midwestern states.

[There are **many other [nasty fights]{.mark}**]{.underline} [between

### 2AC\-\--Thumpers\-\--Investigations

#### Dems [threatening impeachment]{.underline} -- pursuit of oversight turns Congress into a [reality show]{.underline} and [blocks a debt deal]{.underline}

**Ward 6/4** \-\-\-- Jon, Senior Political Correspondent for Yahoo News,
"Impeachment fever will test Pelosi\'s grip as Congress returns this
week," Yahoo News, 2019,
https://news.yahoo.com/impeachment-fever-will-test-pelosis-grip-as-congress-returns-this-week-091500631.html

House Speaker Nancy [[Pelosi will face a]{.underline} **[significant
challenge]{.underline}**]{.mark} this week: [[keeping Democrats united
as]{.mark} they return]{.underline} to Washington [following a Memorial
Day recess in which [the push for impeaching]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [Trump]{.underline} **[[gained]{.mark} new
[momentum]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"Right now Pelosi looks at polling, and it's just not there," said Paul
Kane, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Post, in an
interview for the Yahoo News podcast, "The Long Game."

"A majority of Americans think Trump committed crimes, but a similar
majority doesn\'t think he should be impeached," Kane said. "There's
that middle ground of voters right now who just see impeachment as
another thing, another Washington thing that happens that they will just
tune out."

[[Pelosi had kept her caucus]{.mark} behind her]{.underline} heading
into Memorial Day weekend, [[before]{.underline}]{.mark} special counsel
Robert [[Mueller]{.mark} gave a televised public statement]{.underline}
last Wednesday. [That statement]{.underline} **[[fanned the
flames]{.underline}]{.mark}** [among Democrats who want to begin
impeachment]{.underline} proceedings [in the House]{.underline} now.

["Everybody **was** on the same page]{.underline}. Almost everyone,
anyway. [Then Mueller happens]{.underline} a couple days ago,
[and]{.underline} **[boom,"]{.underline}** [Kane said.]{.underline} This
first week back, Kane said, will be a clear "test to see whether or not
this Mueller statement changed the game."

"I hate using the high school metaphor, but [[the
House]{.underline}]{.mark} of Representatives [[is]{.mark} a lot [like
high school]{.mark}. Once they're all back]{.underline} in the cafeteria
[together]{.underline} \... the [[views]{.underline}]{.mark} **[begin to
[coalesce]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[come
together]{.underline}**,[" he said.]{.underline}

[[Pelosi's concern is]{.underline}]{.mark} that an
[[impeachment]{.underline}]{.mark} proceeding in the House [[would
"allow Trump]{.mark} to play it off as [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[reality show]{.mark} event,"]{.underline}** [Kane said]{.underline}.

If the House votes to impeach Trump, there would be a trial in the
Senate, where the Republicans hold a 53-47 majority.

"They know the Senate is going to end in deadlock, and you would have
essentially a symbolic rebuke of the president that wouldn\'t go
anywhere in terms of actually removing him from office, and politically
it might not be very good for Democrats either," he said.

And so, at the moment, Kane said, Pelosi's challenge is that the country
is not persuaded that impeachment is needed and there are doubts about
whether there's enough of a case for Democrats to make.

"She keeps saying this has to be an overwhelmingly compelling case,"
Kane said. "Right now, it is a case in which the underlying crime of
collusion with Russians in 2016 was left unsettled, not a provable case,
as Mueller says. The obstruction case is there, but it\'s not fully
defined, and it\'s going to take an incredible effort to fully lay the
case out to the public, and convince them that this is a truly
impeachable offense that could involve removal from office."

There are also questions about whether the House Judiciary Committee is
"capable of really prosecuting the case, and turning public opinion \...
in a way that would make Pelosi comfortable politically moving toward
impeachment," Kane said.

"These Democrats on Judiciary, they\'re smart people, but they\'ve never
had to do this before. \[Committee Chairman\] Jerry Nadler never was the
full chairman of a committee before in his life," Kane said.

[Kane]{.underline} also [said]{.underline} that [[how Democrats
proceed]{.mark} on the question of impeachment]{.underline} **[[will
play a big role in whether or not a deal is reached to raise the debt
ceiling]{.underline}]{.mark}** this summer before the nation gets close
to defaulting on its debt obligations this fall, which could send the
stock market and the economy into a tailspin.

In a country where catfight TV rules, the [[twists]{.mark} and turns

[**[so many battles]{.underline}**]{.mark} of will between him and his
opponents.

But [none more so than]{.underline} that between [Trump and]{.underline}
his nemesis John [McCain]{.underline}.

Despite both standing on the same side of the political divide, the
Arizona senator passing the Russian sex dossier on Trump to the FBI has
become the toxic fuel that continues to drive calls for him to be
impeached.

Ex MI6 operative, Christopher Steele's report outlines various
unsubstantiated allegations about the president-elect\'s ties to the
Kremlin.

Of course, the 35-page dossiers needs to be read with caution and for
good reason.

If some of the details relayed by unnamed sources to Steele are true,
they could be impeachable.

Amongst the lurid claims are alleged collusion between Trump surrogates
and Russian intermediaries around the infamous hack of the Democratic
party believed by the US to have been ordered by Putin\'s regime.

Perhaps more serious however is that they claimed Trump had been
susceptible to blackmail, even though he turned down bribes to establish
property deals around the Fifa 2018 World Cup to be hosted by Russia.

### 2AC\-\--A2: Link\-\--Lobbies

#### Lobbies are overrated 

**Insight 3** \[Sept 15 \--lexis\]

Do we really have the best Congress money can buy? Maybe not. Paul
Burstein, a sociology professor at the University of Washington, looked
into the matter and concludes that **[\"Contrary to popular
belief]{.underline}** and typical media portrayals, **[big campaign
contributions and [lobbying do not]{.mark} necessarily [win]{.mark} the
[political influence that determines votes]{.mark} in the U.S.
Congress]{.underline}**.\" Writing in the summer 2003 edition of
Contexts, the magazine of the American Sociological Association,
Burstein says his research indicates **[[votes are]{.mark} more often
than not [dictated by public opinion, ideology and party
affiliation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"The power of interest groups to
get legislators to change their votes in the face of personal ideology
and party commitments is real but very limited,\" Burstein maintains.
And just why does it appear otherwise? The author says that **[part of
the [misconception is due to media focus]{.mark} on the egregious
actions of a few, and part is due to the individual perception that if
government is not doing things \"my way,\" then obviously it is a tool
of special interests.]{.underline}** Burstein says his study merely is
one of many showing that money and **[special interests have little
influence on the shaping of policy]{.underline}**. This influence is
limited by several factors, he says. For one thing,
politicalaction-committee **[[campaign contributions are not large
compared with]{.mark} campaign [costs, so]{.mark} their
[clout]{.mark}]{.underline}** in that regard **[[is
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For another, \"**[there are so [many
lobbyists]{.mark} that most [cannot gain access to]{.mark} members of
[Congress, much less influence them]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" And
lastly, \"**[the number of [members]{.mark} actually [influenced]{.mark}
by contributions and lobbying [is]{.mark} often [too small to
determine]{.mark} the outcome of [key votes]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"
Burstein analyzed key votes from 2002 in reaching his conclusions. Most
followed party affiliation. The major influence on voting, he concludes,
is public opinion.

[What do]{.underline} our [findings say about democracy in]{.underline}
[America]{.underline}? They certainly constitute troubling news for
advocates of "populistic" democracy, who want governments to respond
primarily or exclusively to the policy preferences of their citizens. In
the United States, [our findings indicate]{.underline}, [the
[majority]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[does not]{.mark}
rule]{.underline}**---at least not [in the]{.underline} causal [sense
of]{.underline} actually [**[determin]{.mark}**ing
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline} outcomes. [When a majority]{.underline} [of
citizens disagrees]{.underline} with economic elites or with organized
interests, **[they generally lose]{.underline}**. Moreover, [[because
of]{.mark} the strong [status quo bias]{.mark}]{.underline} built into
the U.S. political system, [[even]{.mark} when **fairly [large
majorities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of Americans favor policy change,
**they generally [do not get it]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A possible
objection to populistic democracy is that average citizens are
inattentive to politics and ignorant about public policy; why should we
worry if their poorlyinformed preferences do not influence policy
making? Perhaps economic elites and interest-group leaders enjoy greater
policy expertise than the average citizen does. Perhaps they know better
which policies will benefit everyone, and perhaps they seek the common
good, rather than selfish ends, when deciding which policies to support.
But we tend to doubt it. We believe instead that---
collectively---ordinary citizens generally know their own values and
interests pretty well, and that their expressed policy preferences are
worthy of respect.50 Moreover, we are not so sure about the
informational advantages of elites. Yes, detailed policy knowledge tends
to rise with income and status. Surely wealthy Americans and corporate
executives tend to know a lot about tax and regulatory policies that
directly affect them. But how much do they know about the human impact
of Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, or unemployment insurance,
none of which is likely to be crucial to their own well-being? Most
important, we see no reason to think that informational expertise is
always accompanied by an inclination to transcend one's own interests or
a determination to work for the common good. All in all, we believe that
the public is likely to be a more certain guardian of its own interests
than any feasible alternative. Leaving aside the difficult issue of
divergent interests and motives, we would urge that the superior wisdom
of economic elites or organized interest groups should not simply be
assumed. It should be put to empirical test. New empirical research will
be needed to pin down precisely who knows how much, and what, about
which public policies. Our findings also point toward the need to learn
more about exactly which economic elites (the "merely affluent"? the top
1 percent? the top one-tenth of 1 percent?) have how much impact upon
public policy, and to what ends they wield their influence. Similar
questions arise about the precise extent of influence of particular sets
of organized interest groups. And we need to know more about the policy
preferences and the political influence of various actors not considered
here, including political party activists, government officials, and
other noneconomic elites. We hope that our work will encourage further
exploration of these issues. [[Despite]{.mark} the **[seemingly
strong]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[empirical support]{.mark} in previous
studies for theories of majoritarian democracy, our [analyses
suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that [majorities of the American
[public]{.mark}]{.underline} actually **[[have little]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} the [policies our
government adopts. Americans do enjoy]{.underline} many features central
to democratic governance, such as regular [elections]{.underline},
[freedom of speech]{.underline} and association, [and]{.underline} a
widespread (if still contested) [franchise]{.underline}.
**[But]{.underline}** [we believe that if [policymaking is dominated
by]{.mark} powerful [business]{.mark} organizations [and]{.mark} a small
number of [affluent Americans]{.mark}, then **America's claims to being
a democratic society are seriously threatened**.]{.underline}

American Democracy? [Each]{.underline} of our four [theoretical
tradition]{.underline}s (Majoritarian Electoral Democracy,
Economic-Elite Domination, Majoritarian Interest-Group Pluralism, and
Biased Pluralism) [emphasizes different]{.underline} sets of [actors as
critical]{.underline} [in determining U.S. policy outcomes, and
each]{.underline} tradition [has engendered]{.underline} a [large
empirical literature]{.underline} that seems to show a particular set of
actors to be highly influential. **[Yet]{.underline}** nearly all the
[[empirical ev]{.mark}idence [has been]{.mark} essentially]{.underline}
[[bivariate. **Until**]{.mark} **very [recently]{.mark}** [it has **not
been possible** to test]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[theories]{.underline} against each other in a systematic, quantitative
fashion. [By directly pitting]{.underline} the [predictions]{.underline}
of ideal-type theories [against each other within a single statistical
model]{.underline} (using a unique data set that includes imperfect but
useful measures of the key independent variables for nearly two thousand
policy issues), [we have been able to produce]{.underline} some
**[striking findings]{.underline}**. [One is the nearly]{.underline}
**[total failure]{.underline}** [of "median voter" and other
Majoritarian Electoral Democracy theories. When]{.underline} the
[preferences of]{.underline} economic [elites]{.underline} and the
stands of organized interest groups [are controlled for, the
[preferences]{.mark} of the average American appear to
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} [**only [a]{.mark} minuscule, near-zero,
statistically [non-significant impact]{.mark} upon public policy.** The
failure]{.underline} of theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy
[is]{.underline} all the [**[more striking]{.mark}** because it goes
against]{.underline} the [likely effects of the limitations of our
data]{.underline}. The [[preferences]{.underline}]{.mark} of ordinary
citizens [[were measured more directly]{.mark} than]{.underline} our
[other independent variables]{.underline}, **[[yet]{.mark} they are
estimated to [have the least effect. Nor]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[do]{.mark} organized [interest groups substitute]{.mark} for direct
citizen influence, by embodying citizens' will]{.underline} and ensuring
that their wishes prevail [in the fashion]{.underline} postulated by
theories [of Majoritarian Pluralism]{.underline}. [Interest groups do
have]{.underline} substantial [independent impacts]{.underline} on
policy, [and a [few]{.mark}]{.underline} groups (particularly labor
unions) [[represent]{.underline}]{.mark} average
[[citizens']{.underline}]{.mark} views reasonably well.
[**[But]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}]{.mark} interest-group
**[[system]{.mark} as a whole [does not]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[Overall, net]{.underline}]{.mark} interest-group
[[alignments]{.underline} **[are not]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[significantly [related to]{.mark} the [preferences of]{.mark} average
[citizens]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [net alignments of the most
influential]{.underline}, business-oriented [[groups]{.underline} [are
**negatively related**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[average [citizen's wishes. So]{.mark} existing interest
[groups]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[do not serve]{.mark}
effectively]{.underline}** [[as transmission belts]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the wishes of the populace as a whole. "[Potential
groups"]{.underline} **[do not take up the slack,]{.underline}** either,
[since average citizens' preferences have]{.underline} little or **[no
independent impact]{.underline}** on policy after existing groups'
stands are controlled for. Furthermore, the [preferences of economic
elites]{.underline} (as measured by our proxy, the preferences of
"affluent" citizens) [have far more independent impact]{.underline} upon
policy change [than]{.underline} the [preferences of average
[citizens]{.mark}]{.underline} do. To be sure, this does not mean that
[ordinary citizens]{.underline} always lose out; they fairly often
[[get]{.mark} the [policies]{.mark} they favor]{.underline}, but
**[[only because]{.mark} [those]{.mark} policies [happen also to be

[[to the "first]{.mark} face" of power: the ability of actors to shape

[the ability to shape the agenda]{.underline} of issues that policy

discussed]{.underline} seriously by policy makers or brought to a vote
[in Congress]{.underline}, and our alternatives are (on average) more
popular among the general public than among interest groups. [Thus the
fate of these policies can reflect policy makers' **refusing to consider
them**]{.underline} rather than considering but rejecting them. (From
our data we cannot distinguish between the two.) Our results speak less
clearly to the "third face" of power: the ability of elites to shape the
public's preferences.49 We know that interest groups and policy makers
themselves often devote considerable effort to shaping opinion. If they
are successful, this might help explain the high correlation we find
between elite and mass preferences. But it cannot have greatly inflated
our estimate of [average citizens' influence on policy making, which is
**near zero**.]{.underline}

"When POTUS Does (Not) Get What He Wants -- A Fuzzy-Set Qualitative
Comparative Analysis Of Presidential Success on the Substance of
Legislation" August 2014, SSRN\]

[The fortunes of the president in the legislative arena are]{.underline}
in large parts [determined by the political context in
Congress]{.underline} (seminal works are Edwards 1989; Bond/Fleisher
1990; Peterson 1990). **[[Party]{.mark} [control]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in Congress [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one -- if not [**[the
main]{.underline}** -- **[single explanatory factor for the level of
presidential legislative success]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Presidents
receive more of what they want under the condition of unified government
than under divided party control]{.underline} of the branches of
government [mainly due to the fact that electoral incentives and policy
goals overlap to a greater extent]{.underline} between the president and
his own party in Congress compared to the opposition party (Rudalevige
2002; Barrett 2005; Barrett/Eshbaugh-Soha 2007; Beckmann 2010). Because
of that [the [president]{.mark}]{.underline} should be able to [[draw
more support]{.mark} for his legislative agenda [from his fellow
partisans]{.mark} than from the other side of the aisle]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the flow of information, the coordination of legislative
tactics and strategies and [the [wheeling and dealing in
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue
[[is much easier and smoother]{.mark} within the same partisan
camp]{.underline} than across party lines (Beckmann 2008). But not only
do the numbers of co-partisans matter; so does the majority party status
itself. [The majority party controls the procedural rules within both
chambers of Congress]{.underline} -- even though the supermajoritarian
and individualistic nature of the Senate limits the powers of the
majority party (Aldrich/Rohde 2000; Monroe et al. 2008). [The powers of
the majority party enable their leadership to steer the legislative
process]{.underline} via the allocation of agenda space, through the
assignment to committees or via setting the rules for final votes. On
the one hand, this makes the congressional leadership a strong ally to
the president that can guard the president's legislative preferences at
different stages of legislation. [Under divided government]{.underline},
on the other hand, [the [majority leadership becomes a **powerful
opponent to the president** that can **hinder his legislative
agenda**]{.mark} in manifold ways]{.underline} (Edwards/Barrett 2000;
Sinclair 2013; Covington et al. 1995).¶ [Another]{.underline} contextual
[factor]{.underline} that shapes the president's success on the
substance of legislation [is]{.underline} **[the distribution of
ideological preferences]{.underline}** in Congress. Over the last
decades, [**[parties in Congress have increasingly
polarized]{.underline}**;]{.mark} [this [means]{.mark}]{.underline}, on
the one hand, [that they have [become]{.mark} **internally [more
ideologically homogeneous]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} on the other hand, **[[ideologically diverged
further apart]{.underline}]{.mark}** from each other (Aldrich/Rohde
2000; Theriault 2008). [Both the inter-party dimension as well as the
intra-party dimension impact the president's position]{.underline} in
the legislative arena. First, [with congressional parties ideologically
drifting apart]{.underline}[, [it is]{.underline}]{.mark} more
**[[difficult to find common ground]{.underline}]{.mark}** on policy
issues, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[affects the president's
odds to score]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the substance of legislation.
[The wider the ideological space]{.underline} between the president,
pivotal legislators and party leaders in Congress, [the more concessions
he has to make]{.underline} on his legislative preferences (Rudalevige
2002; Beckmann 2010; Villalobos 2013). Second, [the process of
intra-party [homogenization triggers the disappearance of]{.mark}
cross-pressured and [moderate]{.mark} members]{.underline} of Congress
leading to greater unity within both parties. [Especially in times of
divided government]{.underline} [moderates]{.underline} from the other
party [are the first contact points]{.underline} for the White House as
partners for bargaining, log-rolling and horse-trading. [[As a
consequence]{.underline}]{.mark} if Congress and the presidency are
controlled by two different parties **[[the White House loses attractive
targets for deal-making]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the other hand, the
internal homogenization helps his party under unified government because
the caucuses consist of fewer possible dissenters (Andres 2005;
Fleisher/Bond 2004; Theriault 2003). However, the Senate's
supermajoritarian rules limit the positive effects polarized parties
have on the position of the president in the legislative arena.
Regardless of unified government or divided government usually 60 votes
are needed to pass a bill in the Senate. Therefore, the positive effects
of polarized parties in Congress unfold only if the majority of the
president's party approximates the filibuster threshold (Fleisher et al.
2012). Besides the partisan and ideological setting in Congress [[the
president's **standing within the public** is a]{.mark} third
[factor]{.mark} contributing [to]{.mark} his legislative
[success]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although empirical findings on the
effects of public support on presidential success are mixed, [the
Washingtonian political communit]{.underline}y -- politicians and
staffers in the White House and the Capitol, lobbyists and journalists
-- as well as the constituents in the country **[perceive [public
support]{.mark} as a [decisive element of]{.mark} the president's
[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital]{.underline}**. Especially on
salient issues [public approval of the president job performance serves
as a cue for legislators]{.underline}. Theoretically, [members in
Congress are reluctant to vote against a popular president]{.underline}
shying away from electoral consequences of their opposition. On the
other side[, if he ranks low]{.underline} in public support members in
[Congress are less prone to vote in accordance]{.underline} with him
(for an overview see Edwards 2009b). High public approval ratings unfold
their effects in combination with other factors like party and ideology.
High presidential approval ratings affect first and foremost those
legislators that are already inclined to support him either because they
are members of the same party or they share the same ideological
orientations. Beyond that [members of Congress from contested
districts]{.underline} -- which likely also have a moderate ideological
disposition -- [are receptive to presidential approval
ratings]{.underline} (Canes-Wrone/de Marchi 2002; Bond et al. 2003;
Lebo/O'Geen 2011; Edwards 2009a; Peterson 1990). Neustadt also points at
the asymmetric effect of presidential support because his "popularity
may not produce a Washington response but public disapproval hardens
Washington's resistance" (Neustadt 1991: 90). **[[Party control,
ideological proximity, and public support constitute]{.mark} the
institutional and [political environment of]{.mark} the [legislative
arena]{.mark} which is largely beyond the president's
control]{.underline}**. Over the last years an **[academic
[consensus]{.mark} has [emerged]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[that]{.underline} **[[party and ideology are the]{.mark}
single [most important parameters for the
president]{.mark}]{.underline}** [while presidential factors only matter
"at the margins"]{.underline} (seminal Edwards 1989; Fleisher/Bond
1990). [[This perspective]{.underline} **[contrasts
with]{.underline}**]{.mark} numbers of journalistic and **[[anecdotic
comments]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} also with a large
body of [(historical) case studies]{.underline} which facilitate the
narrative of presidents shaping their legislative fate via their special
bargaining skills. While earlier studies focused on personal traits or
the presidents' reputation as skilled or unskilled (Lockerbie/Borelli
1989; Fleisher/Bond 1990; Rudalevige 2002, Greenstein 2009), a new
strand of empirical research focuses on the question how presidents can
strategically increase their success through their involvement during
the legislative process. For example, they demonstrate that presidents
are more successful if they prioritize issues (Peterson 1990,
Edwards/Barrett 2000), and if they actively lobby legislators on Capitol
Hill (Beckmann 2010; Beckmann/Kumar 2011a; Covington 1987).
Additionally, presidents are more successful in the legislative arena if
they go public on a given bill (Canes-Wrone 2001; Barrett 2004;
Eshbaugh-Soha 2006). However, [the [necessity of]{.mark} presidential
[lobbying]{.mark} or going public strategies as well as their effects on
his success on the substance of legislation **[varies with the political
contexts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The presidents' need to negotiate
intensively with legislators or to speak out to the public is higher if
he is confronted with less favorable political conditions than if he
faces a positive environment in Congress (Kernell 2007;
Eshbaugh-Soha/Miles 2011). Furthermore, we can theorize that both
approaches unfold their effect in combination with high levels of public
support for the president's position (Canes-Wrone 2001).

### 2AC\-\--PC Fails

#### PC fails -- difference on GOP ideology, obvious Dem backlash, impatience, Schumer as a barrier

**AP 16** \-\-\-- The Associated Press via Fortune, "Donald Trump May
Have Trouble Getting Through Congress," 11/11,
<http://fortune.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-congress/>

The budding new alliance between Donald Trump and congressional
Republicans hides a tougher reality: **[[Even with]{.mark} unified [GOP
control]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Washington, the
[[president]{.underline}]{.mark}-elect\'s [priorities **[may have
trouble]{.mark} getting through Congress**]{.underline}.

And [in some cases Republicans]{.underline} themselves [might be the
barrier]{.underline}.

[Building a]{.underline} border [wall and restricting
immigration]{.underline} from terror-stricken nations? [[Don\'t count
on]{.mark}]{.underline} Senate [[Democrats]{.mark} to go
along,]{.underline} and [[they]{.mark} will]{.underline}
**[[effectively]{.underline}]{.mark}** wield [[veto]{.underline}]{.mark}
power [in many cases]{.underline}.

Repealing President Barack Obama\'s health care law? That looks likely
to happen in some way, shape or form, but a number of states that
accepted that law\'s expansion of the Medicaid health program for the
poor are represented by Republicans. It will take painstaking and
potentially lengthy negotiations to come up with a solution.

And then there are [[Trump\'s]{.mark} protectionist
[views]{.mark}]{.underline} on trade, [skepticism about]{.underline}
international [treaty organizations and]{.underline} [promises to
protect Social Security]{.underline} and Medicare. [All]{.underline}
that **[[flies in the face of Republican]{.mark} Party
[orthodoxy]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and the list goes on.]{.underline}

Still, all that seemed like a problem for another day as Trump paid a
triumphant visit to Capitol Hill on Thursday after a cordial White House
meeting with President Barack Obama.

He sat down with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, whom he derided
as \"very weak and ineffective\" just last month after Ryan distanced
himself over audio of Trump talking about groping women. Ryan was all
smiles as he escorted Trump, wife Melania and Vice President-elect Mike
Pence onto the Capitol Balcony to give them a view of the inauguration
platform being constructed for Trump to take the oath of office Jan. 20.

From there Trump strolled through the Capitol\'s stately Ohio Clock
Corridor with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who\'d
been quick to endorse him but critical of his rhetoric and undisciplined
campaign style. But it was McConnell\'s strategy of refusing to act
after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February that now hands
Trump a Supreme Court vacancy to fill.

And on Thursday there was no sign of strain. The normally reserved
McConnell even seemed to adopt Trump\'s hyperbolic rhetorical style,
declaring their encounter \"a first-class meeting.\"

Ryan, for his part, picked up Trump\'s campaign slogan, telling
reporters: \"We are now talking about how to hit the ground running, and
make sure we get this country turned around, and make America great
again.\"

As he left the Capitol, Trump was asked about his legislative
priorities.

\"A lot of really great priorities. People will be very, very happy,\"
he said. \"We\'re going to move very strongly on immigration. We will
move very strongly on health care. And we\'re looking at jobs.
Big-league jobs.\"

As for specifics, there were none. But [Trump\'s ability [to
deliver]{.mark}]{.underline} on his extravagant campaign
[promises]{.underline} to change Washington and rebuild the nation
[[will require]{.mark} passing laws, **[a tedious
process]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[not]{.mark} built [for]{.mark} instant
[gratification]{.mark}]{.underline}.

He will be able to take some steps through unilateral, executive
actions, a method Republicans repeatedly accused Obama of overusing. But
big-ticket items like tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and most
major policy changes on immigration, health care, energy or trade, would
require Congress\' say-so. And [although Republicans
control]{.underline} the [House, they]{.underline} will [have only
52]{.underline} seats [in the]{.underline} 100-member
[Senate]{.underline} next year, **[well short]{.underline}** [of the
60]{.underline} votes [needed]{.underline} to advance most legislation.

\"[Many]{.underline} of his [[proposals]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[face]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[certain
[filibuster]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the Senate]{.underline},\"
[predicted]{.underline} Jim [Manley]{.underline}, a Democratic
consultant and former top Senate aide.

[[So]{.mark} the **[gatekeeper]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on much of
Trump\'s agenda [may]{.mark}]{.underline} end up
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark}ing New York Sen. Chuck
[[Schumer]{.underline}]{.mark}, who will take over as the Democrats\'
Senate leader in the new Congress. Schumer has had little to say since
the election, beyond issuing a short statement congratulating Trump,
though the two have spoken on the phone. But [few expect
Schumer]{.underline} [and]{.underline} his [Democrats to sign
on]{.underline} to too many of Trump\'s plans.

And the [[areas where Democrats see]{.underline}]{.mark} most [initial
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} with Trump --- on infrastructure
spending, for instance, or his proposal for paid family leave --- [may
[run into]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[problems]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[congressional
[conservatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[reluctant to]{.mark} go along
with big]{.underline} government [[spend]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.

[[Even as GOP]{.underline}]{.mark} leaders
[[pledged]{.underline}]{.mark} [to work together with
Trump]{.underline}, **[[there were]{.mark} signs of policy
[differences]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

At a post-election news conference, [McConnell declined to
endorse]{.underline} [Trump\'s]{.underline} signature border [wall
with]{.underline} [Mexico]{.underline}.

And on trade, Trump has denounced the 12-nation Trans-Pacific
Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration, and both McConnell
and Ryan have indicated it won\'t come to a vote before Obama leaves
office. Yet some establishment Republicans remain convinced that some
kind of deal is sorely needed.

\"The big question is trade. Gotta have trade,\" said GOP Sen. Pat
Roberts of Kansas, who chairs the Agriculture Committee. Roberts said
\"mounds of grain\" are sitting on the ground in Kansas, waiting for
customers.\"Gotta export. And with that, it\'s preferable to have a
trade bill,\" Roberts said, adding of Trump: \"I don\'t think he\'s
opposed to trade bills. He just wants trade bills where he feels we get
an equal shake. So, we\'ll work on it.\"

WASHINGTON - Donald [Trump will use his]{.underline} stunning [victory
to insist voters gave him a mandate to shake up Washington]{.underline}.

He's right. **[But Washington won't play along]{.underline}**.

[[Trump's]{.mark} rise]{.underline} from political outsider to president
of the United States [is [unlikely to move]{.mark} a [Congress]{.mark}
that he **reviled for months**]{.underline}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
a [Congress]{.underline} that [promises to [continue **being**]{.mark}

[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [venomous, [relentless
**partisanship**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that]{.underline} Tuesday's
[election won't stop]{.underline}.

[[He's]{.mark} also [dogged by his **mouth** and]{.mark} his **own
[party]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Top]{.mark}
[R]{.mark}epublican[s]{.mark} **[distanced]{.mark} themselves** from
Trump]{.underline} weeks and sometimes months ago. [And [Trump]{.mark}
has shown a **consistent ability to [alienate]{.mark}** blocs of
[constituents]{.mark} with his **insults**]{.underline}.

"[Trump]{.underline} has a significant mandate," said Jonathan Felts,
former White House political director for president George W. Bush.
"[[His challenge]{.mark} will be **[being disciplined
enough]{.mark}**]{.underline} [so that he can
[spend]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital
**[proactively]{.mark}**]{.underline} moving legislation [[rather than
**wasting it**]{.mark} **having [to clean up]{.mark} self-inflicted
[wounds]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[[Trump will begin]{.underline}]{.mark} his presidency as [[one of the
most]{.mark} **distrusted, [disliked]{.mark}** [men]{.mark} **ever** to
occupy the White House. Nearly two of three]{.underline} people
[in]{.underline} network [exit polls said he was not honest or
trustworthy, and 60 per cent viewed him unfavourably]{.underline}. Just
13 per cent said they were excited about a Trump presidency.

He won after a campaign largely devoid of serious debate over issues.

And while he marshalled an impressive brigade of voters frustrated by a
stodgy, unresponsive political system, [he]{.underline} also [benefited
by running against an opponent with negatives almost as high as
his]{.underline}. What dominated the dialogue between Hillary Clinton
and him were accusations about who is more irresponsible, hateful and
corrupt.

"[[There's **no**]{.mark} **big [mandate]{.mark} for change** of a
policy nature]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Lee
[Miringoff]{.underline}, the director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion.

Trump will try to bring people together, to be sure.

"The [distrust will put [pressure]{.mark} on both parties to work
together]{.underline}," said Michael Feldman, a Democratic consultant
who was a senior adviser to vice-president Al Gore.

"**[That [doesn't mean]{.mark} they'll be
[success]{.mark}ful]{.underline}**. [[There are **huge**]{.mark}**, huge
[obstacles]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Foremost is a Congress where [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[R]{.mark}epublican[s]{.mark} [have been **warring for years**]{.mark},
with **no end in sight**]{.underline}. [[Even]{.underline}
**[within]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [parties, struggles
persist]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**Conservatives** and **centre-right** lawmakers are **at odds** over
whether]{.underline} to stand on [principle or]{.underline} seek
[compromise. Democratic **liberals** are at odds with
**pragmatists**]{.underline}.

[[Congress **won't let Trump dictate its agenda**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
House Speaker Paul [[Ryan separated]{.mark} himself [from Trump]{.mark}
last month]{.underline}, telling House members he would no longer defend
the party's nominee.

2016, "The Potential of Presidential Leadership", Study Done for the
White House Transition Project

[The American political system is **not** a fertile field for the
exercise of presidential leadership]{.underline}. [Most political
actors]{.underline}, from the average citizen to members of Congress,
[are **free to choose** whether to follow the]{.underline} chief
[executive's lead]{.underline}; [the president cannot force them to
act]{.underline}. At the same time, the sharing of powers established by
the Constitution's [checks and balances not only prevent]{.underline}s
[the president from acting unilaterally]{.underline} on most important
matters [but]{.underline} also [give]{.underline}s [other power holders
different perspectives on]{.underline} issues and [policy
proposals]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, the tenacity with which many
[[commentators]{.underline}]{.mark} embrace the persuasive potential of
political leadership is striking. They [often [**fall prey to an
exaggerated concept** of the]{.mark} potential for using the "[bully
pulpit]{.mark}"]{.underline} to go public or [pressuring members of
Congress to fall into line]{.underline} with the White House. [They
routinely explain]{.underline} historic shifts in public policy, such as
those in [the 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s]{.underline}, [in terms
of]{.underline} the extraordinary [persuasiveness]{.underline} of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Ronald Reagan. **[Equally
[striking is the lack of evidence]{.mark} of the persuasive power of the

the academy [base their claims]{.underline} about the impact of such
leadership [on **little or no systematic evidence**]{.underline}.
[[There is **not a single systematic study that**]{.mark} **demonstrates
that [presidents can reliably move others to support
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In sum, [[we **should not infer**]{.mark} from success in winning

### 1AR\-\--Dollar Heg\-\--Impact\-\--Ext\-\--Resilient

#### Dollar hegemony's [strong]{.underline} and [resilient]{.underline}\-\--no collapse

**Wesbury 14** -- Brian S. Wesbury, Chief Economist at First Trust,
"Dollar Ain't Losing Its Reserve Status", 6-23,
http://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2014/6/23/dollar-aint-losing-its-reserve-status

[[A staple of the **doomsday crowd** is]{.mark} the idea [that the US
is]{.mark} on the verge of [losing]{.mark} its "[reserve currency"
status]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's held that prominent financial position
since the end of World War II. But, now, the doomsday crowd argues the
US economy is in a bubble, the Fed is printing money like crazy,
government spending and regulation on the rise, so it's just a matter of
time. Get ready they say, the dollar will plummet in value and interest
rates will skyrocket, even above where US economic fundamentals suggest
they should go, hurtling the economy back into deep recession.

Over the centuries, the world has typically had one key currency - the
Greek drachma or Roman denari in ancient times or the British Pound or
US Dollar in modern times. Other currencies get their value in
comparison and have used these currencies as reserves. Perhaps the best
thing for a country issuing the world's reserve currency is that it
attracts capital from abroad, which lets it run prolonged trade deficits
with the rest of the world.

The one thing they all have in common -- at least, all the ones that
preceded the dollar -- is that they eventually lost their status. So,
it's easy to believe this could happen to the US, especially with all
the bad things going on.

[Other countries in competition with the US like to egg these stories on
and, sometimes, wish they could dislodge the US from its
pedestal]{.underline}. So, Russia, or China, or some OPEC countries talk
about re-denominating transactions.

[But [this is **just talk**]{.mark}. The US reserve currency status
doesn't hinge on how countries denominate their
transactions.]{.underline} They could do the accounting in dominoes or
tiddlywinks. [[In the end, what matters is what foreigners want]{.mark}
to own when the deal is done. And **[that's still
dollars]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The dollar share of foreign central bank reserves]{.underline} -- what
foreign central banks hold to back up their own currencies -- [has
gradually declined since 1999]{.underline}, to about 61% from 71%. [But
that]{.underline} decline [follows a large spike in the 1990s. The
[dollar share of reserves]{.mark} today [is **actually higher**
than]{.mark} it was [in]{.mark} 19**[95]{.mark}**]{.underline}, before
the Euro was created. [**[Seriously, what currency could
compete?]{.mark}** The Chinese [Yuan]{.mark}? It's [not traded outside
China]{.mark}. The country is not free, and the currency is really just
30-years old. The [Euro]{.mark}? In a crisis, [Germany could
leave]{.mark} the currency union, as was rumored a couple of years ago.
It's hard to imagine a Germany-less Euro holding its value over time.
The British [Pound]{.mark}?]{.underline} One key reason the pound [lost
its reserve currency status is that the empire dissolved. That's [not
coming back]{.mark}]{.underline} and the GDP of the UK isn't large
enough. [The [Yen]{.mark}? [That train left the station]{.mark} when
population and the economy peaked years ago]{.underline}.

The US doesn't have to issue the best currency in human history to keep
its reserve currency status; it just has to issue what's most likely to
be the best among its current competitors. We do have to admit that the
Swiss Franc is one darn good currency. Over the past several decades it
has generally gained value versus the dollar and we wouldn't at all be
surprised if that trend continued. But Switzerland has a population of 8
million people with a GDP of about \$650 billion and a national debt of
roughly \$125 billion. The world needs much more debt and GDP for
foreign central banks to use the Swiss Franc to back up their currencies
in a responsible fashion.

In other words, [[you can look]{.mark} all across the globe [and not
find a worthy successor]{.mark} to the US Dollar]{.underline}. This
won't stop the doomsday stories, but, hopefully, it will help you ignore
them. **[[The dollar is here to stay, for a long time to
come]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Euro can't rival the Dollar -- Europe faces geographic/historical/cultural divisions and political instability 

**Stratfor 16** \-\-\-- "The Decline of the Dollar Is Not the Decline of
the United States," 5/2,
<https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/decline-dollar-not-decline-united-states>

**[[No]{.mark} Obvious Potential [Successors]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[For many years]{.underline}, the mantle of [global financial hegemony
was held by Europe]{.underline}an powers. Collectively, Europe is a
region more populated than the United States with roughly the same
global economic output --- and far more international trade.
**[However]{.underline}**, [one of [Europe\'s **defining
characteristics**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} its
[divisions]{.mark}, both [geographical and historical]{.mark}. Europe is
riven by mountain [ranges and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[peninsulas
allow]{.mark}ing [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} like Germany and France
[[to generate]{.mark} and trade]{.underline} large quantities of [[goods
without being]{.mark} forced to]{.underline} [work [together]{.mark} to
transport them]{.underline} to the ocean and beyond. The [[result is
a]{.underline} **[continent defined]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [[cultural]{.mark} differences, with
**strong**]{.underline} [[identities]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been
[[formed]{.mark} often]{.underline} **[[in direct
opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to one another]{.underline}. These
[identities]{.underline} **[hinder]{.underline}** [attempts to unify the
continent]{.underline} under a single banner, be it by military means
like those of Napoleon, or political means like the European project.

In the short term, sheer political willpower can overcome these
obstacles, but [ultimately [European unity **tears itself**]{.mark}
**from [within]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[eurozone
encountered]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} **[just
[eight years]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark}to]{.underline} its
[existence]{.underline}. [[Attempts]{.mark} to]{.underline} solve the
crisis by [transfer]{.underline}ring [capital]{.underline} from the
wealthier north to the worse-affected south (and Ireland) have [led to
rising friction]{.underline} within the bloc. [This]{.underline} has
[[led to]{.underline}]{.mark} the emergence of [[populist and
nationalist]{.underline}]{.mark} political
[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the south advocating a write-off of
debt and in the north seeking an end to bailouts. [Both
regions]{.underline} have seen [demand]{.underline}s [to
exit]{.underline} the eurozone. The [[euro is]{.mark} a
currency]{.underline} [whose foundations are [laid]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[in different]{.mark} [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
[all]{.underline}]{.mark} [of whom]{.underline} have [proved
**[unwilling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or]{.underline}
**[unable]{.underline}** [to pull together]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
crisis. The [[next crisis could]{.underline}]{.mark} very easily **[[see
the currency\'s end.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### China and the Yuan can't supplant the West -- debt, overcapacity, economic/social fragmentation, inequality, dependence on the international order, a struggling consumer sector, missing strategic depth, insignificant innovation, and unwillingness to place the Yuan as the global reserve 

**Stratfor 16** \-\-\-- "The Decline of the Dollar Is Not the Decline of
the United States," 5/2,
<https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/decline-dollar-not-decline-united-states>

On the other end of the Eurasian landmass is
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose population dwarfs that of the United
States and which could, within the next 20 years, have an overall
economic size far greater. But it is also a country that [**[is
ending]{.underline}** [its]{.underline}]{.mark} [economic [miracle
and]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[built up]{.mark} **many
problems**]{.underline}, [including [debt and]{.mark}]{.underline}
industrial [[overcapacity]{.mark}. China\'s]{.underline} economic
[slowdown will exacerbate]{.underline} its [internal and external
**challenges**]{.underline}. [While China]{.underline}\'s population [is
predominantly Han, the country\'s]{.underline} harsh
[[geography]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[harbored a nation]{.mark} that
is]{.underline} **[[deeply fragmented]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both
[[economically and culturally. China\'s]{.mark} economic
[miracle]{.mark}]{.underline} has [**[exacerbated]{.underline}**
[inequalities]{.underline}]{.mark} among its regions and various groups.
Managing the balance has forced China to keep a strong centralized
government, and that centralization has strengthened under President Xi
Jinping since 2012.

[[China is]{.mark} now [more dependent]{.mark} on the
global]{.underline} financial [system]{.underline} **[[than]{.mark} it
has [ever]{.mark} been]{.underline}**. [[Unlike]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[[China]{.mark} **is not relatively isolated** from trade,
it]{.underline} **[[does not]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet [[have a]{.mark}
vibrant [consumer sector]{.mark}, it lacks [strategic
depth]{.mark}]{.underline} from outsiders militarily, [[and]{.mark} it
does not possess]{.underline} [the same]{.underline} productive and
encompassing [[tech]{.mark}nological innovativeness]{.underline}.

[China is become]{.underline} increasingly [anxious about these
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}, which [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[outside]{.mark} its [control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and even more
concerned that the power backing its regional rivals Japan and South
Korea --- the United States --- has a stranglehold over the global
financial system. From Beijing\'s perspective, the United States\' power
is not just a function of sheer military strength. Therefore, to China,
protecting itself from the United States requires not only building up
its defenses but also subverting the economic power that the United
States can bring to bear.

Whether or not U.S. actions are directed at China, these vulnerabilities
are forcing Beijing to take a more active stance on international
issues, including trade and finance. However, [[China]{.underline}
**[does]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[not]{.underline}**
[want]{.underline}]{.mark} [the yuan [to replace the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} as the global benchmark currency. [For the
Chinese currency to do so, [China would]{.mark} have to]{.underline}
**[[drastically]{.mark} [reform]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[its
financial system [by]{.mark}]{.underline} [liberalizing the]{.underline}
yuan [exchange rate, removing capital flows and taking other [actions
that]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[undermine]{.mark} Beijing\'s
[control]{.mark}]{.underline} over the country as it navigates a crucial
economic shift over the next two decades. [Even [as China embarks
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[internationalization]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the yuan [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[liberalization]{.underline}]{.mark} of parts of its currency regime,
[[it is]{.mark} doing it]{.underline} [**[very slowly]{.underline}**
[and in ways that]{.underline}]{.mark} would **[[prevent]{.mark} real
offshore [liquidity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to the point that it no
longer has control over its currency]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Econ\-\--Impact

#### Economy [resilient]{.underline} -- their impacts are epistemologically faulty and exaggerated -- durability of macro-economic trends, empirical examples of the policy/economic disconnect, offset uncertainty for households/businesses, and faith in intervening actors

**SEB 17** \-\-\-- Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Group, "**[Global
[Economy Resilient to]{.mark} New Political
[Challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**," 2/22,
https://sebgroup.com/press/news/global-economy-resilient-to-new-political-challenges

The [interplay between economics and politics was]{.underline}
undoubtedly a [dominant]{.underline} feature of analyses [during
2016]{.underline}. As we know, it was difficult to foresee both election
results and their economic consequences. It was certainly not strange
that economists were unable to predict the Brexit referendum outcome or
Donald Trump's victory, when public opinion polling organisations and
betting firms failed to do so, but lessons might be learned from the
economic assessment impacts they made. [[Economists]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably **[tend to [exaggerate]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
[importance of more general [political phenomena]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While in the midst of elections that appear historically important, [[it
is **tempting to present alarmist**]{.mark}
**[projections]{.mark}**]{.underline} about election outcomes [that seem
improbable and/or]{.underline} [unpleasant]{.underline}.
[**[But]{.underline}** [once]{.underline}]{.mark} [the initial
[shock]{.mark} effect [has faded]{.mark}, **more
[ordinary]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic [[data]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} corporate reports and [macroeconomic
figures]{.underline} **[[take the upper hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Psychological effects often exaggerated]{.underline}

[One important observation is]{.underline} that [[it is **difficult to
find any**]{.mark} **historical [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[between]{.mark} heightened]{.underline} security [[policy
tensions]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[economic
activity]{.underline}. [Households and businesses]{.underline} **[do not
seem]{.underline}**]{.mark} to be [especially [sensitive]{.mark} in
their consumption or capital]{.underline} [spending]{.underline}
behaviour. This is perhaps because [[uncertainty]{.underline} **[is
offset]{.underline}** [by investments]{.underline}]{.mark} in a defence
build-up, for example. Only when the conditions that directly determine
profitability and investments are affected, for example via rising oil
prices or poorly functioning financial markets, will the effects become
clear.

[[Markets]{.mark} also]{.underline} seem to [[have]{.mark} a **general
[tendency]{.mark}** [to assume]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [economic
[policy makers]{.mark} can actually]{.underline} **[[behave
rationally]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in crisis situations,]{.underline}
until this has been disproved. **[Both]{.underline}** [[during]{.mark}
the US sub-prime]{.underline} mortgage [crisis of]{.underline}
2007-[20[08]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the [euro
zone]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} [existential crisis]{.underline} a few
years later, [for a rather long time the [market **maintained**]{.mark}
**its [faith]{.mark}** that a response would come]{.underline}. [Not
[until]{.mark} after a [lengthy]{.mark} period of [inept
actions]{.mark}]{.underline} by decision makers [did these crises become
genuinely acute]{.underline}, with large secondary effects as a
consequence. This [market \"[patience\" is]{.mark}]{.underline}
presumably [[based]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a long-time [pattern of]{.mark}
recurring [bailout measures]{.mark}]{.underline} by governments and
central banks, [which usually benefit risk-taking]{.underline} at the
expense of caution or speculation that policy responses will not
materialise.\\

#### Econ decline [doesn't]{.underline} cause conflict

from International Rivalries," April 22, 2015,

[[Do economic downturns generate]{.mark} pressure for diversionary
[conflict?]{.mark}]{.underline} Or might downturns encourage austerity
and economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that [economic stress is associated with **conciliatory
policies**]{.mark} **between strategic rivals.**]{.underline} For states
that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible
toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking
political steps to manage the competition. [[Drawing on data from **109
distinct rival dyads**]{.mark} since 1950, **[67 of which
terminated,]{.mark}** the [evidence suggests rivalries were]{.mark}
approximately **[twice as likely to terminate during]{.mark} economic
[downturns]{.mark}**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true [controlling for **all** ]{.mark}**of
the [main alternative explanations for peaceful relations]{.mark}
between foes**]{.underline} (democratic status, nuclear weapons
possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international
**[[systemic changes),]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[as well as]{.mark}
**many** **[other]{.mark}** possible [**confounding variables**.
This]{.mark}]{.underline} research [**[questions existing
theories]{.underline}** [claiming]{.underline}]{.mark} that [economic
[downturns are associated with **diversionary war**, and]{.mark} instead
[argues]{.mark}]{.underline} that in certain circumstances **[[peace may
result from economic troubles]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The final]{.underline} significant [outcome addresses **[a dog that
hasn\'t barked]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [the effect of [the Great
Recession]{.mark} on]{.underline} cross-border [conflict]{.underline}
and violence. During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple
[[analysts asserted]{.underline}]{.mark} that the financial [[crisis
would lead]{.underline}]{.mark} states [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
increase their use of [[force]{.underline}]{.mark} as a tool [[for
staying in power]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 [They voiced]{.underline}
genuine [concern]{.underline} that the global economic [downturn would
lead to an]{.underline} [increase in conflict]{.underline}---whether
[through]{.underline} greater [internal [repression]{.mark},
[diversion]{.mark}ary wars, [arms races, or]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[ratcheting up]{.underline}]{.mark} of great power
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Violence in the Middle East, border
disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy
movement fueled impressions of a surge in global public disorder. The
**[aggregate [data suggest otherwise]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however.
The [Institute for Economics and Peace]{.underline} has
[concluded]{.underline} that \"the average level of
[[peace]{.mark}fulness [in 2012 is]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately
[[the same as]{.underline}]{.mark} it was in
[200[7]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"43 [Interstate
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline} in particular has
**[[declined]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the start of the financial
crisis[, [as have]{.underline}]{.mark} [military
[expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} in most sampled countries. [Other
studies confirm]{.underline} that [the Great Recession]{.underline}
**[has not triggered any increase in violent conflict]{.underline}**, as
Lotta Themner and Peter Wallensteen conclude: \"\[[T\]he pattern
is]{.underline} one of [relative stability]{.underline} when we consider
the trend for the past five years.\"44 The secular decline in violence
that started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed. Rogers
[[Brubaker]{.underline} [observes]{.underline}]{.mark} that \"[the
[crisis has not]{.mark} to date [generated]{.mark} the surge in
[protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline} that

#### Empirically denied, instability burns out, and no backing for extremism -- reject their evidence, it's internet fear-mongering

"The New Rules: Security Remains Stable Amid Financial Crisis", Asset
Protection Network, 8-25,
http://www.aprodex.com/the-new-rules\--security-remains-stable-amid-financial-crisis-398-bl.aspx)

[When the]{.underline} global [financial crisis struck]{.underline}
roughly a year ago, [the blogosphere was ablaze with]{.underline} all
sorts of [scary predictions of]{.underline}, and commentary regarding,
[ensuing]{.underline} conflict and [wars \-- a rerun of the Great
Depression leading to world war]{.underline}, as it were. Now, as global
economic news brightens and recovery \-- surprisingly led by China and
emerging markets \-- is the talk of the day, it\'s interesting to look
back over the past year and realize how globalization\'s first truly
[[worldwide recession has had **virtually no impact**]{.mark} whatsoever
[on]{.mark} the [international security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}landscape. [[No]{.mark}ne of the]{.underline} more than
three-dozen [[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed by
GlobalSecurity.org [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[attributed to
the]{.mark} global [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the last
new entry]{.underline} (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah
[in]{.underline} the [Palestine)]{.underline} [**predates** the economic
crisis]{.underline} by a year, and three quarters of the chronic
struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity
conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican
\"drug war\" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last
August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony
of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger
(followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an
almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway
regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most
familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and
liberation-themed terrorist movements. [Besides]{.underline} the recent
[Russia-Georgia]{.underline} dust-up, [[the only]{.underline}]{.mark}
two potential [state-on-state [wars]{.mark} (North v. South Korea,
Israel v. Iran) [are]{.mark}]{.underline} both tied to one side
acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity \-- a process [[**wholly unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [economic trends]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [with the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
effectively [tied down by]{.underline} its two ongoing major
interventions (Iraq and
[Afghanistan-]{.underline}bleeding-into-Pakistan), our
[[involvement]{.mark} elsewhere]{.underline} around the planet [[has
been]{.mark} quite **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both leading up to
and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual
counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with
allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia\'s coast).
[[Everywhere]{.mark} else [we find]{.mark} serious [instability
we]{.mark}]{.underline} pretty much **[[let it
burn]{.underline}]{.mark}**, occasionally pressing the Chinese \--
unsuccessfully \-- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example,
hasn\'t led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces.
So, [[to sum up]{.mark}: No significant uptick in]{.underline} mass
[violence or unrest]{.underline} (remember the smattering of urban riots
last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); The usual
frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places);
[[**Not a single state-on-state war directly caused** (and no
great-power]{.mark}-on-great-power [crises]{.mark} even
[triggered]{.mark}); No]{.underline} great improvement or [disruption
in]{.underline} great-power [cooperation regarding]{.underline} the
emergence of new [nuclear powers]{.underline} (despite all that
diplomacy); A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by
the system\'s acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the
strain); and No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge
that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are
Moscow\'s occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western
hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing
rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up
their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we\'ve finally
seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in
the late 1980s, but even that\'s likely to wane given the stress on
public budgets created by all this unprecedented \"stimulus\" spending.
If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the
most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. [Can we
say]{.underline} that [the world has suffered a]{.underline} distinct
[shift to]{.underline} political [radicalism]{.underline} as a result of
the economic crisis? Indeed, [no. The]{.underline} world\'s [major
economies remain]{.underline} governed by [center-left]{.underline} or
center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both
markets and trade. [In the short run, there were]{.underline} attempts
across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect,
as much [protectionism]{.underline} as allowed under current trade
rules), [but]{.underline} there was [[no]{.mark} great [slide into
\"trade wars.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead, [[the
**W**]{.underline}]{.mark}orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization [[is
functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was designed to function, and
regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we
say [Islamic [radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline} was inflamed by the
economic crisis? If it was, that shift [[was clearly overwhelmed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Islamic world\'s growing [[disenchantment
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the brutality displayed by violent extremist
groups such as [[al-Qaida]{.underline}]{.mark}. And looking forward,
austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting
evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day,
the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to
provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes,
even as it has sparked a spirited \-- and much needed, as I argued last
week \-- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as
the world\'s primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and
pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it
the beginning of \"economic warfare\" and the like between \"fading\"
America and \"rising\" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated
production chains and interconnected financial markets, such \"diverging
interests\" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I
don\'t welcome a world in which America\'s fiscal profligacy goes
undisciplined, so bring it on \-- please! Add it all up and it\'s fair
to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience
of America\'s post-World War II international liberal trade order. Do I
expect to read any analyses along those lines in the blogosphere any
time soon? Absolutely not. I [[expect]{.mark} the [**fantastic
fear-mongering** to proceed]{.mark}]{.underline} apace. [[That\'s what
the Internet is for]{.underline}]{.mark}.

end]{.underline}. Rivalries are an appropriate set of cases to use when
examining substitutability both because leaders in rival states have
clearly substitutable choices and because rivalries are a set of cases
in which externalization is a particularly plausible policy option.7 In
particular, [when confronted [with domestic problems,
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} in a rivalry [[have]{.mark} the clear
[alternatives of escalating]{.mark} the conflict]{.underline} with the
rival [[to divert]{.underline}]{.mark} attention
[[or]{.mark}]{.underline} to work to [[settle]{.mark}]{.underline} the
rivalry [[as a means of freeing up]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[substantial]{.underline} amount of [[resources]{.mark} that can be
directed [to]{.mark}ward solving [internal
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the case of the diversion
option, rivals provide logical, believable actors for leaders to target;
the presence of a clear rival may offer unstable elites a particularly
inviting target for hostile statements or actual conflict as necessary.
The public and relevant elites already consider the rival a threat or
else the rivalry would not have continued for an extended period; the
presence of disputed issues also provides a casus belli with the rival
that is always present. Rivals also may provide a target where the
possible costs and risks of externalization are relatively controlled.
If the goal is diversion, leaders willwant to divert attention without
provoking an actual (and expensive)war. Over the course of many
confrontations, rival states may learn to anticipate response patterns,
leading to safer disputes or at least to leaders believing that they can
control the risks of conflict when they initiate a new confrontation. In
sum, rivals provide good targets for domestically challenged political
leaders. This leads to our first hypothesis, which is as follows:
*Hypothesis 1*: Poor economic conditions lead to diversionary actions
against the rival. [Conflict [settlement is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[a distinct route]{.mark} to dealing with internal problems that
leaders in rivalries may pursue [when faced with]{.mark} internal
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Military
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between states [[requires]{.mark}
large amounts of [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, and rivals require
even more attention. [Leaders may choose to negotiate a settlement that
ends a rivalry to free up important resources]{.underline} that may be
reallocated to the domestic economy. [[In]{.mark} a "guns versus butter"
world of economic [trade-offs, when a state can no longer]{.mark} afford
to [pay]{.mark} the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry,
[it is]{.mark} quite [rational]{.mark} for leaders [to]{.mark} reduce
costs by [end]{.mark}ing [a rivalry]{.mark}. This gain]{.underline} (a
peace dividend) [could be achieved at any time]{.underline} by ending a
rivalry. [However, [such]{.mark} a gain [is likely]{.mark} to be most
important and attractive to leaders [when internal conditions are
bad]{.mark} and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems.
[Support]{.mark} for policy change away from continued rivalry
[is]{.mark} more [likely to develop when]{.mark} the [economic situation
sours]{.mark} and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a
worsening situation. It is at these times that [the pressure to
cut]{.mark} military investment [will be grea]{.mark}test and that state
leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay
for a rivalry]{.underline}. Among other things, this argument also
encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically with the United
States. *Hypothesis 2*: [Poor economic conditions increase the
probability of rivalry termination**.**]{.underline} Hypotheses 1 and 2
posit opposite behaviors in response to a single cause (internal
economic problems). As such, they demand a research design that can
account for substitutability between them.

#### Governments buffer damages, safety nets work, and empirics prove

**Zakaria 9** (Fareed, Ph.D. in Political Science -- Harvard University
and Editor -- Newsweek International, "The Secrets of Stability",
Newsweek, 12-21, Lexis)

One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming apart. The
global financial system, which had fueled a great expansion of
capitalism and trade across the world, was crumbling. All the
certainties of the age of -globalization\--about the virtues of free
markets, trade, and technology\--were being called into question. Faith
in the American model had collapsed. The financial industry had
crumbled. Once-roaring emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil
were sinking. Worldwide trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since
the 1930s. Pundits whose bearishness had been vindicated predicted we
were doomed to a long, painful bust, with cascading failures in sector
after sector, country after country. In a widely cited essay that
appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: \"The conventional wisdom
among the elite is still that the current slump \'cannot be as bad as
the Great Depression.\' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in
fact, be worse than the Great Depression.\" Others predicted that these
economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the
worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new
U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the
Senate that \"the financial crisis and global recession are likely to
produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the
next year.\" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly
alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in
several emerging markets. Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would
ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not
globalization. One year later, how much has the world really changed?
Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment banks (three, if you
count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone bust. There was some
turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the financial crisis) in
Iran. Severe problems remain, like high unemployment in the West, and we
face new problems caused by responses to the crisis\--soaring debt and
fears of inflation. But [overall, things look nothing like they did in
the]{.underline} 19[**30s**. The [predictions of economic]{.mark} and
political [collapse have **not materialized**]{.mark} at all. A key
measure]{.underline} of fear and fragility [is the ability of
poor]{.underline} and unstable [countries to borrow money]{.underline}
on the debt markets. [So consider this: the]{.underline} sovereign
[bonds of]{.underline} tottering [Pakistan have returned 168
percent]{.underline} so far [this year]{.underline}. All
[this]{.underline} doesn\'t add up to a recovery yet, but it [does
reflect a return to]{.underline} some level of [normalcy]{.underline}.
And [that rebound has been]{.underline} so [rapid]{.underline} that even
the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. \"The question I have at the
back of my head is \'Is that it?\' \" says Charles Kaye, the co-head of
Warburg Pincus. \"We had this huge crisis, and now we\'re back to
business as usual?\" This revival did not happen because markets managed
to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, [[governments]{.mark},
having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not
to repeat the same mistakes]{.underline} once this crisis hit. [By
[massively expanding]{.mark} state [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
economy\--[through central banks and national treasuries\--they
[**buffered** the worst]{.mark} of the [damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The
[extensive [social safety nets]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been
established across the industrialized world also [[cushioned]{.mark} the
pain]{.underline} felt by many. [Times are]{.underline} still [tough,
but things are nowhere near as bad as in the]{.underline}
19**[30s]{.underline}**, when governments played a tiny role in national
economies. It\'s true that the massive state interventions of the past
year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government
guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some
irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these
[rallies]{.underline} also [demonstrate the return of confidence, and
confidence is a very powerful economic force]{.underline}. When John
Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he
believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the
real motor of the economy started cranking again\--the animal spirits of
investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit. Beyond all
this, though, I believe [there\'s a fundamental reason why we have not
faced global collapse in the last year. It is the same reason that [we
weathered the]{.mark} stock-market [crash of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[87]{.mark}**, the [recession of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[92]{.mark}**, the [Asian crisis]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**97**,
the [Russian default]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**98**, [and]{.mark} the
[tech-bubble collapse]{.mark} of]{.underline} 20[**00**.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline} current [[global economic system is
**inherently**]{.mark} **more [resilient]{.mark}** than we think. The
world today is [characterized by]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[major
forces for stability]{.mark}, each [reinforcing the
other]{.mark}]{.underline} and each historical in nature.

#### 2008 crushes their impact

**Drezner, 12** (Professor International Politics Tufts University, '12
(Daniel, October, "The Irony of Global Economic Governance: The System
Worked" Council on Foreign Relations International Institutions and
Global Governance)

In looking at outcomes, [the obvious question is [how well the]{.mark}
global [economy]{.mark} has recovered from the 20[08]{.mark}
crisis]{.underline}. The current literature on economic downturns
suggests two factors that impose significant barriers to a strong
recovery from the Great Recession: [it was triggered by a financial
crisis and it was global in scope]{.underline}. Whether measuring
output, per capita income, or employment, [financial crashes trigger
downturns that last longer]{.underline} and have far weaker recoveries
than standard business cycle downturns.10 Furthermore, [the global
nature of the crisis makes it extremely difficult for countries to
export their way out of the problem]{.underline}. Countries that have
experienced severe banking crises since World War II have usually done
so when the global economy was largely unaffected. That was not the case
for the Great Recession. [The global economy has rebounded much better
than during the Great Depression]{.underline}. Economists Barry
Eichengreen and Kevin O'Rourke have compiled data to compare global
economic performance from the start of the crises (see Figures 1 and
2).11 Two facts stand out in their comparisons. First, [the percentage
drop in global industrial output and world trade levels at the start of
the 2008 financial crisis was more precipitous than the falloffs
following the October 1929 stock market crash]{.underline}. The drop in
industrial output was greater in 2008 nine months into the crisis than
it was eighty years earlier after the same amount of time. The drop in
trade flows was more than twice as large. Second, the post-2008 rebound
has been far more robust. Four years after the onset of the Great
Recession, [global industrial output is 10 percent higher than when the
recession began]{.underline}. In contrast, [four years after the 1929
stock market crash, industrial output was at only two-thirds of
precrisis levels.]{.underline} A similar story can be told with
aggregate economic growth. According to World Bank figures, [global
economic output rebounded in 2010 with 2.3 percent growth]{.underline},
followed up in 2011 with 4.2 percent growth. The global growth rate in
2011 was 44 percent higher than the average of the previous decade. Even
more intriguing, the growth continued to be poverty reducing.12 The
World Bank's latest figures suggest that despite the 2008 financial
crisis, extreme poverty continued to decline across all the major
regions of the globe. And the developing world achieved its first
Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 levels of extreme
poverty.13 An important reason for the quick return to positive economic
growth is that [cross-border flows did not dry up after the 2008
crisis]{.underline}. Again, compared to the Great Depression, [trade
flows have rebounded extremely well]{.underline}.14 Four years after the
1929 stock market crash, trade flows were off by 25 percent compared to
precrisis levels. Current trade flows, in contrast, are more than 5
percent higher than in 2008. Even compared to other postwar recessions,
the current period has seen robust crossborder exchange. Indeed, as a
report from CFR's Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies
concluded in May 2012, "[The [growth]{.mark} in world trade
[since]{.mark} the start of [the]{.mark} \[current\] [recovery]{.mark}
[exceeds]{.mark} [even the best]{.mark} of the [prior]{.mark} postwar
[experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}."15 Other cross-border flows have also
rebounded from 2008--2009 lows. Global foreign direct investment (FDI)
has returned to robust levels. FDI inflows rose by 17 percent in 2011
alone. This put annual FDI levels at \$1.5 trillion, surpassing the
three-year precrisis average, though still approximately 25 percent
below the 2007 peak. More generally, global foreign investment assets
reached \$96 trillion, a 5 percent increase from precrisis highs.
Remittances from migrant workers have become an increasingly important
revenue stream to the developing world---and the 2008 financial crisis
did not dampen that income stream. Cross-border remittances to
developing countries quickly rebounded to precrisis levels and then rose
to an estimated all-time high of \$372 billion in 2011, with growth
rates in 2011 that exceeded those in 2010. Total cross-border
remittances were more than \$501 billion last year, and are estimated to
reach \$615 billion by 2014.16 Another salient outcome is mass public
attitudes about the global economy. [[A general
assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} in public opinion research [is that
[during a downturn]{.mark}, demand for greater economic closure should
spike, as [individuals scapegoat foreigners]{.mark} for domestic
woes]{.underline}. [The global nature of the 2008 crisis, combined with
anxiety about the shifting distribution of power, should have triggered
a fall in support for an open global economy]{.underline}. Somewhat
surprisingly, [[however]{.mark}, the reverse is true]{.underline}. Pew's
Global Attitudes Project has surveyed a wide spectrum of countries since
2002, asking people about their opinions on both international trade and
the free market more generally.17 [The [results show]{.mark}
**[resilient support]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} expanding [trade]{.mark} and
business ties with other countries]{.underline}. Twenty-four countries
were surveyed both in 2007 and at least one year after 2008, including a
majority of the G20 economies. Overall, eighteen of those twenty-four
countries showed equal or greater support for trade in 2009 than two
years earlier. By 2011, twenty of twenty-four countries showed greater
or equal support for trade compared to 2007. Indeed, between 2007 and
2012, the unweighted average support for more trade in these countries
increased from 78.5 percent to 83.6 percent. Contrary to expectation,
there has been no mass public rejection of the open global economy.
Indeed, public support for the open trading system has strengthened,
despite softening public support for free-market economics more
generally.18 [The final outcome addresses]{.underline} a dog that hasn't
barked: [[the effect of]{.mark} the Great [Recession on]{.mark}
crossborder [conflict]{.mark} and violence]{.underline}. During the
initial stages of the crisis, multiple [analysts asserted that the
financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a
tool for staying in power]{.underline}.19 [Whether through greater
internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up
of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global
economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict.]{.underline}
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in
global public disorder. **[[The aggregate data suggests
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. A fundamental conclusion from
a recent report by the Institute for Economics and Peace is that "[the
average level of [peacefulness in]{.mark} 20[12]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
approximately **[the same]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} it was in
20[07]{.mark}."]{.underline}20 [Interstate [violence]{.mark} in
particular has [declined]{.mark} [since the]{.mark} start of the
[financial crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}---as have military expenditures
in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that **[the Great
[Recession]{.mark} [has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in [violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the secular decline in violence that
started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.21

#### No impact -- we've survived periods of low readiness

**NSN, 8** (National Security Network 8 (May 13,
<http://www.nsnetwork.org/node/850>)

Our military is second to none, but eight years of negligence, [[lack of
accountability]{.mark}, and a reckless war in [Iraq]{.mark} have
[left]{.mark} our ground [forces facing shortfalls]{.mark} [in both
recruitment and readiness]{.mark}. Every service is out of balance and
ill-prepared.]{.underline} We need a new strategy to give the military
the tools it needs for the challenges we face today. And we need
leadership that meets our obligations to the men and women who put their
lives on the line. Overview The U.S. military is a fighting force second
to none. It didn't get that way by accident -- it took decades of
careful stewardship by civilian as well as military leaders in the
Pentagon, the White House, and on Capitol Hill. But eight years of
Administration recklessness, and a lack of oversight from conservatives
on Capitol Hill, have put the military under enormous strain.
Active-duty generals at the highest levels have said that "[[the current
demand for our forces is not sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}... We
can't sustain the all-volunteer force at the pace that we are going on
right now" (Army Chief of Staff George Casey, April 2008); that in
[terms of readiness, [many brigades]{.mark} being sent [back to
Afghanistan and Iraq were "not where they need to]{.mark}
be"]{.underline} (Army Vice-Chief of Staff Richard Cody, SASC
subcommittee hearing, April 14, 2008); and that "[we cannot now meet
extra force requirements in places like Afghanistan"]{.underline}
(Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen on National Public Radio,
April 2008). Readiness and Response: Two-thirds of the Army -- virtually
all of the brigades not currently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq -- are
rated "not combat ready." The dramatic equipment shortages of a few
years ago have been improved but not completely remedied. Recruitment
and Retention: [These conditions of service, and the strains they place
on military family members, have hindered Army efforts]{.underline} (and
to a lesser extent those of the Marine Corps) [to recruit and retain the
requisite number and quantity of service members. [The Army has been
forced to lower]{.mark} its educational and moral [standards]{.mark}
[and allow]{.mark} an increasing number of [felons into its
ranks]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is also struggling to keep junior
officers, the brains of the force, who represent the height of the
military's investment in its people -- and whose willingness to stay on
represents a crucial judgment on Administration policies. The Marine
Corps, America's emergency 911 force, is under similar strain. The
Commandant of the Marine Corps said in February 2008 that the Marines
will not be able to maintain a long term presence in both Afghanistan
and Iraq. The National Guard and Reserve are already suffering from
severe shortages of equipment and available combat personnel. In many
states, the Army National Guard would struggle to respond to a natural
or man-made disaster -- just as the Kansas National Guard struggled to
respond to the severe tornados last year. How, and whether, we rebuild
our military in the wake of the fiasco in Iraq will likely shape it for
the next generation. [Too much of our military posture is left over from
the Cold War. Our forces are being ground down by low-tech insurgencies
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the most immediate threat confronting the
U.S. is a terrorist network that possesses no tanks or
aircraft.]{.underline} We must learn the lessons of Iraq and
dramatically transform our military into a 21st century fighting force
ready to confront the threats of today and tomorrow.

[[If Trump were to follow]{.mark} through on [his threat to not do
anything]{.mark}]{.underline} with Congress [[until]{.underline}]{.mark}
House [[Democrats drop]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[investigations,
**things**]{.mark} **could [get even dicier]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Within the next few months, [the debt ceiling will need to increase and
the government will need to be funded.]{.underline} Democrats might have
been tempted to hold those bills hostage, just as Republicans have done
in the past---but now Trump has given them an opportunity to pass an
increase and a spending bill and dare the president to call their bluff.
[[A senior]{.mark} government [official]{.mark} [told CNBC]{.mark} that
[the debt ceiling and funding are not subject to Trump's
ultimatum,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[but]{.underline}** [the president
has demonstrated]{.underline} **[again and again]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that [[only he can speak for himself.]{.mark} And [if he doesn't act,
and the U.S. defaults or shuts down? **It could be fodder for**]{.mark}
**another article of [impeachment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Thus far, [Pelosi]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[has been the
brake]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [members]{.mark} of
her caucus]{.underline} most [**[eager to impeach]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} [Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} [erratic [behavior
is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[backing her into an]{.mark}
ever-more-[untenable situation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On Wednesday,
[she said, "I pray for the president]{.underline} of the United States.
And I pray for the United States of America." Later on Wednesday, she
said, "In plain sight, this president is obstructing justice and is
engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense." On
Thursday, [she said]{.underline} that [she was concerned for Trump's
well-being]{.underline} [and said he was conducting an "assault on the
Constitution]{.underline} of the United States." But [Pelosi continues
to say she doesn't support impeachment]{.underline}, and reportedly told
Democratic lawmakers, "He wants to be impeached, so he can be exonerated
by the Senate."

[[With each comment]{.mark} like this, [Pelosi's balancing]{.mark}
act]{.underline} [**[becomes more challenging]{.underline}**. [Even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} it is true that the [[odds of
conviction]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Senate following an impeachment
[[are]{.mark} very long[, **it's difficult** to tell]{.mark} your
[members and]{.mark}]{.underline} your [[constituents]{.mark} that [the
president]{.mark} is attacking the Constitution and has [committed
impeachable acts, and then decline to]{.mark} even launch an
[impeach]{.mark}ment inquiry]{.underline}. There's an analogy with the
Republican rhetoric about Barack Obama: Once GOP voters were convinced
that Obama was a tyrant, everything the Republican Congress did short of
acting that way started to look like a betrayal, and incumbents paid a
price for that in their primary elections.

[While [Pelosi's]{.mark} explicit [position]{.mark} is against
impeachment, her implicit position]{.underline}, I have argued,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [**[not yet.]{.underline}** [Trump's
response]{.underline}]{.mark} to the investigations [[is making
yet]{.underline} **[closer]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for her and for the
rest of the Democrats]{.underline}**. His fingers are in the trap, and
he's pulling furiously, but [[the trap is]{.mark} just [getting

happens if the U.S. becomes one of the world\'s leading bad guys? [Can
the U.S.]{.mark} still [maintain]{.mark} soft power [if]{.mark} it is
[extolling]{.mark} hard-edged [nationalism]{.mark} and xenophobia,
**[disdaining]{.mark} longstanding [alliances]{.mark}** [and
**fomenting** ]{.mark}**the [breakup of the entire]{.mark} post-World
War II [system]{.mark}** that America put in place seven decades
ago?]{.underline} What would it look like? Who would it attract? And
where will it take the world? In fact, although a number of prominent
figures have warned against the American abdication of liberal world
order leadership and the related erosion, or even the end, of American
soft power, I would argue that [in hewing to the Trump foreign policy
line the US will in fact continue to maintain a considerable "ability to
shape the preferences of others".]{.underline} [But it won't be
via]{.underline} the sort of [attraction]{.underline}, persuasion, ideas
and ideals that analysts and policy formulators weaned on postwar
bipartisan consensus U.S. internationalism (this writer included) will
be remotely comfortable with, nor will they (we) celebrate the sort of
leaders, activists and publics who respond positively to this version of
American soft power. They (we) won't like the results, to put it
exceedingly mildly. [With]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration violently casting off U.S. fealty to such watchwords of
the exceptionalist American faith as "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness," "the last best hope of earth," "Give me your tired, your
poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," or "a tall, proud
city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and
teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace," [it can
be hard to imagine that the U.S. could still hold soft
power]{.underline}, albeit of a dramatically different cast, attractive
to a disturbingly different audience. As an aid to the (nightmare)
imagination-challenged, an apt metaphor for what lies ahead for U.S.
soft power, should the Trump Administration succeed in its radical
recasting of American values and policies at home and abroad, can be
found in the Classics---of comedy, that is: Saturday Night Live, and a
hilarious, terrifying sketch featuring "Überman." No, this has nothing
to do with a car ride service. Überman was the brainchild of Al Franken,
an SNL writer-performer before his election to the U.S. Senate. In 1979
Franken posed the counterfactual question, "What If....Superman Grew Up
in Germany instead of America?" In Franken's re-imagination of
Superman's origin story, young Kal-El's rocket lands during the interwar
years in Prussia rather than Kansas, where he is raised by ardent Nazis
who, as his adoptive father reminds him, "taught you how the Fatherland
was stabbed in the back at Versailles, how Jews are parasites, how
Germany will one day bring order to the world!" Thus inspired, Klaus
Kent, "a mild-mannered clerk for the Ministry of Propaganda," becomes
Überman, proudly declaring to Adolf Hitler his fight for "Untruth,
Injustice and the Nazi Way," saving Der Führer from a hidden bomb he
discovers with his X-ray vision, and denouncing Jimmy Olsteyn as a
Jew---whose secret he also uncovers with his X-ray vision (get it?).
After depositing the hapless Jimmy at Auschwitz Überman wins the Battle
of Stalingrad in five minutes, singlehandedly rounds up two million
Jews, and "Kills Every Person in England---U.S. Next", as the headline
blares in Der Daily Planet. [**[The longer]{.mark} Donald [Trump
holds]{.mark} on to [power]{.mark}**, and hence the longer the sinister
soft power Trumpism manifests is projected around the world, [the
**greater the**]{.mark} **encouragement to, and [impact on]{.mark}**,
the unsavory populist nationalist movements and [authoritarian
regimes]{.mark} to which America is now perversely offering
inspiration]{.underline}. Donald Trump's unabashed "America First"
foreign policy is the metaphorical equivalent of Überman's gruesome
reversal of Superman's biography and principles. Al Franken's sketch
encapsulates the unfolding Up-Is-Down, Black-Is-White, Good-Is-Evil and
Evil-Is-Good disjunction and the [[**global havoc** the U.S. is]{.mark}
in the process of [wreaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. It isn't necessary to
rehearse at length the list of the Trump administration's head-snapping,
system-shattering statements and policy shifts that is by now painfully
well-known to readers even as it grows daily like The Blob (Steve
McQueen's, not Ben Rhodes'). The last time influential Americans and
their supporters among the public unapologetically embraced unpalatable
policies and values like immigration restriction, racism and
anti-Semitism, the results included Adolf Hitler sending a fan letter to
the anti-immigrant "scientific" eugenicist Madison Grant, a Nazi medal
for Henry Ford in honor of his vicious published attacks on Jews, and
the modeling of the Nuremberg Laws on Jim Crow segregation codes
---indeed, there was more than a touch of Überman to the United States
even at the dawn of the Age of Superman. But at least at America's helm
during most of the decade prior to U.S. entry into World War II was
Franklin D. Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor and a host of New Dealers, who
endorsed, if disappointingly imperfectly at times, equality and
inclusiveness for African-Americans, Jews and recent immigrants
---rather than far-right incubus counterfactual presidents like Buzz
Windrip in Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here and Charles Lindbergh
in Philip Roth's The Plot Against America. However, with Donald Trump in
the White House there is no presidential moral counterpoise, but rather
a celebration of some of the most disturbing pathologies embedded deep
in American politics and society, raging back in the open after many
decades of disreputability. And as Überman doesn't cease to be, well,
super, because of his malevolent predilections, [[Trumpian]{.mark}
America will not]{.underline} not ce[ase to possess [soft power]{.mark}.
But it [will be]{.mark} of a **dark, [sinister]{.mark} cast**:
Lionizing, legitimating and **[inspiring]{.mark} populist [nationalist
leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Austrian far-right party head Harald
Vilimsky preened after Trump's inauguration, "He is a winner, we are
winners: Frauke Petry, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, all of us here are
winners"); [Providing moral cover for foreign publics'
xenophobia]{.underline}; [Setting an example for would-be strongmen of
delegitimizing the press]{.underline} ("the enemy of the American
people") and demonstrating the efficacy and impunity of pedaling the
most brazen disinformation; Confirming longstanding extreme left- and
right-wing accusations that the U.S. has no special redeeming qualities,
even vis-à-vis the autocratic, sanguinary Putin regime ("We've got a lot
of killers---you think our country is so innocent?"); [Encouraging and
steering the weakening or even the **[break-up]{.mark} of the European
Union, NATO and the [WTO]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[[Legitimating]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir [[Putin's Russia]{.mark} as
a defender of Western values]{.underline}; [And stoking a
racial-ethnic-religious Western civilizational antipathy toward
Islam]{.underline} in toto [and the broader non-Western
world]{.underline}. If you think all of this is dispiriting to read,
imagine what it was like to write it---Sad! (Utterly heartbreaking,
actually.) But is all in fact lost? [[Is America]{.mark}n soft power
[destined to]{.mark} henceforth [be]{.mark} a malign,
**[destabilizing]{.mark} force** in the **world**? Perhaps [not.
**If**]{.mark} **Donald [Trump rapidly falls]{.mark} out of favor with
the bulk of the American electorate**]{.underline}---and remember, he's
already rather more than halfway home in this regard---[he could be
**rendered a political loser in short order** and **tossed out** of the
White House, **[taking]{.mark} foreign policy [Trumpism]{.mark} down**
[with him.]{.mark} The]{.underline} [20[18]{.mark}]{.underline} and
especially 2020 [**[elections will be pivotal]{.mark}** in this
regard]{.underline}. [It would be essential [for]{.mark} the
**[speediest]{.mark} possible [resuscitation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} U.S.
[soft power]{.mark}]{.underline} that Trump as a one-termer (or less) be
succeeded by a president, whether Republican or Democratic, dedicated to
a firm re-commitment to the traditional American values, ideas and
ideals that Trump & Co. have so blithely cast aside. In this scenario,
the U.S. would still be dealing with long-term fallout from its
misadventure in international illiberalism. As Warren Buffett famously
noted, "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin
it. If you think about that, you\'ll do things differently." Still,
while it would indeed probably take a couple of decades to well and
truly live down the damage done even in four years (or less) by the
Trump administration, [it would not be the most difficult national
reputation-rebuilding effort ever undertaken]{.underline}---think of
what West Germany faced in the years following World War II. However, if
Donald Trump is re-elected in 2020 and is thus given a mandate by the
American public [to continue the radical recasting of U.S. foreign
policy---and with it the **overturning of the extant international
order**---then the fundamental shift in the nature and effects of
American soft power is likely to be, in practical terms, **permanent**
for a half-century or more. This will be especially so if this shift is
accompanied by an incremental domestic turn toward authoritarianism and
the concomitant erosion of the political opposition\'s ability to
reclaim power]{.underline}. There\'s another factor to reckon with as
well: [[the **longer**]{.mark} **Donald [Trump holds]{.mark} on to
[power]{.mark}**, and hence the longer the sinister soft power Trumpism
manifests is projected around the world, the **greater the encouragement
to, and impact on, the unsavory populist nationalist movements** and
**authoritarian r**egimes to which America is now perversely offering
inspiration]{.underline}. Even if [the [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} were
to rapidly regain its ideological bearings once a hypothetical two-term
Donald Trump has left office and go back to manifesting its traditional
values-based soft power, it [[could find]{.mark} itself up against [a
bevy of formerly pro-liberal]{.mark} internationalist [states]{.mark}
that have **[metastasized]{.mark}**]{.underline} into Trumpian soft
power-inspired illiberal democracies or cold-out dictatorships now
cleaving to Russia and/or China---which will remain autocracies [seeking
[to **undermine U.S.**]{.mark} **global [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Thus, a resuscitated Superman America might well end up facing the
daunting threat of Überman World.

### 1AR\-\--Turn\-\--Impeachment\-\--A2: Fails\-\--Senate

#### "Senate won't indict" assumes current conditions -- Trumps [awful response]{.underline} to impeachment proceedings will [flip the calculus]{.underline}

**Goldberg 17** (Jonah, 6-14-2017, National Review senior editor,
bestselling author and columnist and fellow of the National Review
Institute, Robert J. Novak Journalist of the Year at the Conservative
Political Action Conference (CPAC), \"Trump Will Probably Be Impeached
if Republicans Lose the House\" National Review,
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448590/democrats-take-back-house-2018-trump-probably-impeached>)

Unless it steps up soon, Democrats will probably take back the majority
in 2018 --- and take down the president. The 1998 midterm election was a
debacle for Republicans, particularly then-speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich. Since Reconstruction, no president had seen his party gain
seats in the House in a midterm election six years into his presidency.
Gingrich, who made the election a referendum on impeaching President
Bill Clinton, resigned after the loss. Clearly, voters had sent the
signal, "Don't do it." The White House thought it had dodged a bullet.
But one morning, over Thanksgiving break, then--White House chief of
staff John Podesta was running in Washington's Rock Creek park when it
hit him: GOP leaders are "not going to let their members off the hook.
They're going to beat and beat and beat on them until they vote for
impeachment." It fell to Podesta to tell the still-celebrating White
House staff that the midterms meant nothing, that the push to impeach
the president in the House was a runaway train that could not be
derailed. "This thing is rigged," Podesta announced at a Monday-morning
staff meeting. "We are going to lose." President Trump's White House
could use a John Podesta about now. Because [no one seems to have told
Trump's team that the Democrats are every bit as committed to impeaching
Trump as the GOP was to impeaching Clinton. The difference, of course,
is that the Democrats don't control the House --- yet]{.underline}. [If
they did]{.underline}, as the Washington Examiner's Byron York rightly
noted recently, [impeachment proceedings would already be
underway]{.underline}. And [if the Democrats take back the House in
2018, it won't matter to most members whether the country as a whole
supports impeachment, because the voters who elected them --- and the
donors who supported them --- will be in favor of it.]{.underline} (A
recent Public Policy Polling survey found that 47 percent of Americans
support impeachment while 43 percent oppose it.) Personally, I think it
would be folly to impeach the president given what we know now. But
that's meaningless. The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors"
notwithstanding, the criteria for impeachment have little to do with
criminal law and everything to do with politics. [If 218 members of the
House think it is right --- or simply in their political interest --- to
impeach the president, he can be impeached. [Whether]{.mark} two-thirds
of the [Senate decides to remove the president]{.mark} from office
[is]{.mark} also [a]{.mark}n entirely [political
decision.]{.mark}]{.underline} Given the likely composition of the
Senate after the next election, however, that remains unlikely. Then
again, who knows? [**[Given how Trump responds to criticism]{.mark}**
and political pressure, [would you]{.mark} want to [bet]{.mark} that
[the tweeter-in-chief would be a model of]{.mark} statesmanlike
[restraint during]{.mark} an [impeachment ordeal]{.mark}? So many **of
[his current problems are]{.mark} the [direct result of letting]{.mark}
his [ego or frustration get the better of him. What fresh troubles would
he mint when faced with removal]{.mark} from office**? [What might he
**say under oath** to the special counsel?]{.mark} [Clinton, recall, was
impeached]{.mark} and disbarred [because he **perjured**]{.mark} himself
in [a deposition]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only hope for the Trump
presidency is for the GOP to maintain control of the House. House
minority leader Nancy Pelosi has cautioned against making the midterms a
referendum on impeachment. But that is an electoral strategy, not a plan
for when she gets the speaker's gavel. And even if she declines to go
straight to impeachment hearings on Day One, a Democratic-controlled
House would still be a nightmare for the White House. Any hope of
passing a conservative agenda would die instantaneously. Worse, once
Democrats gained the power to subpoena documents and compel testimony
from members of the administration, the Hobbesian internal politics of
today's White House would look like a company picnic by comparison. In
short, the only hope for the Trump presidency is for the GOP to maintain
control of the House. According to various reports, the GOP thinks it
can hold on by running "against the media" in 2018. As pathetic as that
would be, it might work. Though I doubt it. A better strategy would be
to actually get things done. And the only way for that to happen is for
both houses of Congress to get their act together. Voting bills out of
the House may be enough to justify a Rose Garden party, but it will do
little to sway voters who've been told for years that the GOP needs
control of all three branches to do big things. Trump won't be on the
ballot in 2018, but his presidency will hang in the balance.

### 1AR\-\--Turn\-\--Impeachment\-\--A2: No Impact\-\--2020 Solves

#### 2020 could easily be too late -- faster Trump removal key

**Mcmanus 17** (Doyle Mcmanus, American journalist, columnist, who
appears often on Public Broadcasting Service\'s Washington Week, May
21^st^, \"Should we wish for a President Pence?,\" La Times, Available
online at
<http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-president-pence-20170521-story.html>)

[President Mike Pence?]{.underline} [The question is way ahead of where
we are]{.underline}. There's no solid reason to expect that President
Trump will leave office before his term is done, whether by resignation,
impeachment or the untried mechanism of the 25th amendment. But that
hasn't stopped anyone from talking about it --- from Republicans wistful
for the days of a functional White House to Democrats trying to guess
which unpalatable future would be worse for their battered party. And
the answer should be straightforward. **[[Pence]{.mark} would be [an
improve]{.mark}ment on grounds of simple
[competence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[He [would make]{.mark} the
[country safer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Under a President Pence,
**[Americans [would have less cause to fear]{.mark} that [a blundering
president might lead us into war with No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [or
Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Progressives would find almost nothing to
like in Pence's domestic policies. There's no sugarcoating that. He
would be the most conservative president of modern times --- easily more
conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald Reagan, the right's
patron saint. He would be the most conservative president of modern
times --- easily more conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald
Reagan. His economic views are in line with orthodox Republicanism:
lower taxes, smaller government, fewer regulations. Pence's positions on
social issues spring from Christian conservatism: He's fiercely opposed
to abortion, gay marriage and almost any expansion of rights for gays,
lesbians and transgender people. [Despite all that,]{.underline} unlike
the president, [he has read the Constitution and understands its
meaning. **He would be less likely than Trump to try to pressure the FBI
to drop an investigation**, to take one example. He has even defended
freedom of the press]{.underline}. He was coauthor of a bill to protect
journalists from being compelled to identify their sources, and he
founded a bipartisan press freedom caucus --- along with, of all people,
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Glendale), now one of the top congressional
investigators pursuing Trump. "He's a person of real integrity," said
Rick Boucher, a former House member from Virginia who was the Democratic
coauthor of the bill to shield journalists. "He's very conservative,
especially on social issues. But he does have respect on the other side
of the aisle. [[He's very serious about public policy, and willing to
work with Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} where there's common
purpose."]{.underline} (That doesn't mean Boucher is ready to endorse
his old colleague for president. "I was a strong Obama supporter," he
said. "I won't sleep easy until there's a Democrat in the White House.")
To be sure, Pence already has questions to answer about his short tenure
as vice president. After Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Pence
vigorously parroted the White House's initial explanation that Comey was
cashiered based on a recommendation from the Justice Department. That
wasn't true --- and Pence may have known it wasn't true at the time.
Pence has also maintained that he didn't know Trump's first national
security advisor, Michael T. Flynn, was under investigation by the FBI
when he was appointed. That denial may turn out to be true. Even though
Pence was formally the chairman of Trump's transition, he wasn't in the
president-elect's inner circle when the initial staffing decisions were
made. There's plenty of evidence that even now, Trump aides spend much
of their time hiding important facts from each other. In any case, the
FBI's investigation of Flynn is likely to bring any discrepancies to
light. (In which case: President Paul Ryan? That's a matter for another
column.) As a matter of pure politics, it's impossible to predict
whether a President Pence could improve GOP prospects in the 2018
congressional election or win reelection himself in 2020. But Pence
represents a slice of his own party, the social conservative right,
which has never won a presidential nomination, let alone a general
election. (George W. Bush ran with their support, as did Mitt Romney,
but neither was as rooted among social conservatives as Pence.) He'd
have a lot of work to expand his appeal beyond the GOP base, to attract
independent Trump loyalists who might blame him for their man's
downfall, or spurn him as the kind of establishment politician they
abhor. And, if he were to become president, he'd come under immediate
pressure from those Trump loyalists to pardon his predecessor for any
crimes committed in office or during the campaign. The last time that
happened, when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon in 1974, it left
the new president vulnerable to a Democratic challenger. [It's
tempting]{.underline}, of course, for partisan Democrats [[to]{.mark}
say: [Let Republicans continue to struggle in the mess Trump
makes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Why give them a chance to right their ship?
The worse the better]{.underline}. [But that **[ignores the risks
that]{.mark} would [come from allowing Trump to continue
exercising]{.mark} the [powers of the presidency in]{.mark} both law
enforcement and [foreign policy]{.mark}**[. For the next three
years]{.mark}, given the limited alternatives, [I'd opt for President
Pence --- the sooner the better]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[Even]{.mark} a [Congress that intended to contain]{.mark}
[Trump]{.mark} [would be limited]{.mark} in its reach]{.underline}**. It
[is [hard to overturn]{.mark} a presidential [veto]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
the expansion of executive [authority]{.mark}]{.underline} we've seen in
recent decades [has given the president plenty of power to wield even
faced with a hostile legislature]{.underline}. "Having worked in the
modern executive branch, **[[the notion]{.mark} that [Congress
has]{.mark} plenty of [weapons]{.mark} in the case of a very bad
president [is overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}**," [says Sunstein, who
ran the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under
Obama]{.underline}. "[[If w]{.mark}e]{.underline} really [[had a
terrible president]{.mark} [determined]{.mark} to go in directions that
were economically terrible or terrible for national
security]{.underline}, my view is **[[Congress would]{.mark} [have very
limited]{.mark} [ability to stop it]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
[first]{.underline} [because of the difficulty of]{.underline} getting a
[consensus]{.underline}, [but second because even if you got
one]{.underline}, **[[there's much the president can do]{.mark} [on his
own]{.mark}]{.underline}**." So here's where we are now. [The president
is more powerful than the founders ever envisioned]{.underline}. [We
have a political system built around parties, which gives the president
protection from the massive congressional majorities needed to activate
impeachment]{.underline}. We have constructed an electoral system that
neither follows the public will nor includes safeguards against
demagogues and knaves --- elites have lost control of primaries and
ceded power over the Electoral College even as 40 percent of
presidential elections since 2000 have been won by the loser of the
popular vote. And atop all that, [our political culture has evolved to
see the removal of a president as a historic, perhaps dangerous,
affront.]{.underline} Whatever this is, it is not the system the
founders foresaw. The result of all this is that [faced with an
erratic]{.underline} and even [dangerous president]{.underline}, we try
to criminalize or medicalize his actions. Democrats want to see Donald
[[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} removed from office because they believe he
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} unfit to hold the job and [[a danger every
day]{.mark} he remains in it]{.underline}, but few believe that is
enough to merit impeachment. This is why Rep. Sherman, who introduced
articles of impeachment against Trump into Congress, says, "the legal
theoreticians will tell you that impeachment just a matter of politics.
I\'m a politician, and I\'m here to tell you that it\'s a matter of
legal analysis." This is why Lofgren calls for a medical evaluation.
Even if this is a correct judgment about politics, it is profoundly
reckless. [[We]{.mark} have [made the presidency]{.mark} too
powerful]{.underline} to leave the holder of the office **[[functionally
unaccountable]{.underline}]{.mark}** for four years. We have created a
political culture in which firing our national executive is viewed as a
crisis rather than as a difficult but occasionally necessary act. And we
have done this even though we recognize that **[the
[consequences]{.mark} [of leaving the]{.mark} [wrong president]{.mark}
in power can [include]{.mark} horrors beyond imagination --- [World War
III,]{.mark}]{.underline}** as Sen. Corker suggested.

My fixation on this question began with President Donald
[[Trump]{.mark}'s tweets to North Korea's Kim Jong Un]{.underline}.
[This was]{.underline} the president of the United States, [the man [who
controls]{.mark} [the]{.mark} world's largest [nuclear arsenal]{.mark},
launching [deranged]{.mark}]{.underline}, unvetted
[[provocations]{.mark} at the most singularly irrational regime in the
world]{.underline}: **[This was [not even his official
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The]{.mark} [rest of the]{.mark} Trump
[administration]{.mark} [was trying to ratchet down tensions]{.mark}
with North Korea. [But the president]{.mark} himself [was
undermining]{.mark} the effort:]{.underline} Republican Sen. Bob
[[Corker]{.underline}]{.mark}, the widely respected chair of the Foreign
Relations Committee, [[warned]{.mark} that [the president
was]{.mark}]{.underline} treating his office like "a reality show" and
[[setting the country "on the path to World War
III]{.underline}]{.mark}." In an interview with the New York Times, he
said of Trump, "I know for a fact that every single day at the White
House, it's a situation of trying to contain him." These concerns,
Corker told the Times, "were shared by nearly every Senate Republican."
[It's not just Senate Republicans who worry over the president's
stability]{.underline}. Carl [Bernstein]{.underline}, of Watergate fame,
told CNN that his reporting [found "a consensus developing in the
military, at the highest levels in the intelligence
community]{.underline}, among Republicans in Congress, including the
leaders in the business community," [that Trump "is unfit to be the
president]{.underline} of the United States." A subsequent poll by the
Military Times found only 30 percent of commissioned officers approved
of the job Trump was doing. The fear is shared by members of Trump's own
staff. Axios's Mike Allen reported that a collection of top White House
advisers see themselves as an informal "Committee to Save America," and
they measure their success "mostly in terms of bad decisions prevented,
rather than accomplishments chalked up." The Associated Press reported
that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and then-Homeland Security Secretary
John Kelly "agreed in the earliest weeks of Trump\'s presidency that one
of them should remain in the United States at all times to keep tabs on
the orders rapidly emerging from the White House." Their concerns echo
across the broader public. A September Quinnipiac poll found that 56
percent of voters believe Trump is unfit for office. Despite low
unemployment and steady economic growth, Trump's favorability is stuck
below 40 percent --- making him, at this point in his term, the most
unpopular president since the advent of polling. Of late, [[I have been
asking]{.mark} Republicans who work either in the White House or closely
with it [whether Trump]{.mark} is learning on the job --- whether he is
[becoming more judicio]{.mark}us, more disciplined, more
serious]{.underline}. **[[The answer]{.mark}, [unanimously]{.mark}, is
that [he is not]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [He is the man he was the day he
stepped into the Oval Office, the same man he was on the campaign trail,
the same man so many of us feared he would be as president]{.underline}.
In a November 2 interview on WMAL radio in Washington, [Trump lamented
his inability to use his power to prosecute his political
enemies]{.underline}. "You know the saddest thing, because I'm the
President of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with
the Justice Department," he said. "I am not supposed to be involved with
the FBI. I'm not supposed to be doing the kinds of things that I would
love to be doing. And I'm very frustrated by it." It is impossible to
imagine the hellstorm that would have followed a similar utterance by
President Barack Obama or George W. Bush. [That [Trump's]{.mark} [daily
provocations]{.mark} have [left us inured]{.mark} and jaded to such
authoritarian yearnings is, itself, an injury he has inflicted upon
us.]{.underline} Of late, [Trump has taken to suggesting the Access
Hollywood tape]{.underline} --- where he is clearly shown bragging about
sexual assault --- [is a fraud]{.underline}. These are statements,
notably, that Trump can not only be seen making, and heard making, but
statements he has admitted making. As is often the case, [it is unclear
whether Trump is lying to us, or if he is somehow lying to himself, as
well. And it is hard to say which would be scarier.]{.underline} We talk
often about running the US government like a business, but businesses
--- at least public ones --- have clear methods for deposing a
disastrous executive[. [The president]{.mark} of the United States
[controls]{.mark} [the]{.mark} world's largest [nuclear arsenal]{.mark},
[not to mention]{.mark} the [vast resources]{.mark} and powers of the
federal government, and [so the]{.mark} possible [damage]{.mark} of
letting the wrong person inhabit the Oval Office [stretches all the way
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[global catastrophe]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
But is there anything we can do about it?

"Trump's 19th Century Foreign Policy", Politico,
[www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-foreign-policy-213546?o=2](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-foreign-policy-213546?o=2)

One of the most common misconceptions about Donald Trump is that he is
opportunistic and makes up his views as he goes along. But a careful
reading of some of [[Trump's statements]{.underline}]{.mark} over three
decades [[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [he has [a]{.mark}
remarkably]{.underline} coherent and [[consistent worldview]{.mark}, one
that is [unlikely to change]{.mark} much if he's elected president. It
is also a worldview that makes a great leap backward in
history]{.underline}, embracing antiquated notions of power that haven't
been prevalent since prior to World War II. It is easy to poke fun at
many of Trump's foreign-policy notions---the promises to "take" Iraq's
oil, to extract a kind of imperial "tribute" from U.S. military allies
like South Korea, his eagerness to emulate the Great Wall of China along
the border with Mexico, and his embrace of old-style strongmen like
Vladimir Putin. But many of these views would have found favor in
pre-World War II---and even, in some cases, 19th century---America. In
sum, [Trump believes that America gets a raw deal from the liberal
international order]{.underline} it helped to create and has led since
World War II. He has three key arguments that he returns to time and
again over the past 30 years. He is deeply unhappy with America's
military alliances and feels the United States is overcommitted around
the world. He feels that America is disadvantaged by the global economy.
And [he is sympathetic to authoritarian strongmen]{.underline}. [[Trump
seeks]{.mark} nothing less than [**ending the U.S.-led liberal order**
and freeing]{.mark} America [from]{.mark} its international
[commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump has been airing such views on
U.S. foreign policy for some time. He even spent \$100,000 on a
full-page ad in the New York Times in 1987 that had a message remarkably
similar to what he is saying today. With his background and personality,
Trump is so obviously sui generis that it is tempting to say his views
are alien to the American foreign policy tradition. They aren't; it is
just that this strain of thinking has been dormant for some time. There
are particular echoes of Sen. Robert Taft, who unsuccessfully ran for
the Republican nomination in 1940, 1948 and 1952, and was widely seen as
the leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Taft was a
staunch isolationist and mercantilist who opposed U.S. aid for Britain
before 1941. After the war, he opposed President Harry Truman's efforts
to expand trade. Despite being an anti-communist, he opposed containment
of the Soviet Union, believing that the United States had few interests
in Western Europe. He opposed the creation of NATO as overly
provocative. Taft's speeches are the last time a major American
politician has offered a substantive and comprehensive critique of
America's alliances. Trump's populism, divisiveness and friendliness
toward dictators is also reminiscent of Charles Lindbergh, once an
American hero, who led the isolationist America First movement. In some
areas, Trump's views go back even further, to 19th-century high-tariff
protectionism and every-country-for-itself mercantilism. He even invokes
ancient Chinese history, telling Bill O'Reilly last August that his idea
for a wall across the U.S.-Mexican border is feasible because "you know,
the Great Wall of China, built a long time ago, is 13,000 miles. I mean,
you\'re talking about big stuff." \*\*\* [Trump's starting
point]{.underline} and defining emotion [on foreign policy is
anger]{.underline}---[not at America's enemies, but at its
friends]{.underline}. In a lengthy interview with Playboy magazine in
1990, Trump was asked what would a President Trump's foreign policy be
like. He answered: "He would believe very strongly in extreme military
strength. He wouldn't trust anyone. He wouldn't trust the Russians; he
wouldn't trust our allies; he'd have a huge military arsenal, perfect
it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we're defending some of
the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing. \... We're being
laughed at around the world, defending Japan." He then elaborated on his
skepticism of allies. "We Americans are laughed at around the world for
losing a hundred and fifty billion dollars year after year, for
defending wealthy nations for nothing, nations that would be wiped off
the face of the earth in about 15 minutes if it weren't for us. Our
'allies' are making billions screwing us." Trump has long believed the
United States is being taken advantage of by its allies. He would prefer
that the United States not have to defend other nations, but, if it
does, he wants to get paid as much as possible for it. No nation has
come in for quite as much criticism from Trump as Japan. "It's time for
us to end our vast deficits by making Japan and others who can afford it
pay," Trump said in an open letter to the American people in 1987. "Our
world protection is worth hundreds of billions of dollars to these
countries and their stake in their protection is far greater than ours."
In the intervening years, he found new targets but he never let go of
his antagonism toward the Japanese. On the campaign trail recently, he
took the unusual step of promising to renegotiate the 1960 U.S.-Japan
Treaty. "If somebody attacks Japan," he said, "we have to immediately go
and start World War III, OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to
help us. Somehow, that doesn't sound so fair. Does that sound good?" He
has also criticized other allies. In 2013, he said, "How long will we go
on defending South Korea from North Korea without payment? When will
they start to pay us?" He has made the point again on the campaign
trail. In an interview with NBC, he said, "We have 28,000 soldiers on
the line in South Korea between the madman and them. We get practically
nothing compared to the cost of this." Trump doesn't let Europe off the
hook, either. Several years ago, he wrote, "Pulling back from Europe
would save this country millions of dollars annually. The cost of
stationing NATO troops in Europe is enormous. And these are clearly
funds that can be put to better use." On the campaign trail, he
complained that Germany is not carrying more of the burden of NATO and
asked why the United States should lead on European security. The truth
is very different. America's allies do pay for a proportion of U.S.
bases. But they do not pay the full cost. This is largely because those
alliances also work to America's benefit by providing it with
prepositioned forces and regional stability. It would actually cost more
to station troops in the United States and have to deploy them overseas
in a crisis. But this rings hollow for Trump because he is not convinced
that the United States should be doing it at all. So when Trump
constantly utters what may be his favorite refrain on the stump---"Our
country doesn't win anymore"---he is referring to a view he's held for
decades. He wants to get paid as much as possible for all the things the
United States does to secure the international system (never mind that
this same system laid the groundwork for the greatest burst of
prosperity in human history, with the United States as the main
beneficiary). This includes, but is not limited to, alliances. As the
world's only superpower, one of America's most important functions has
been to ensure open access to what are called the global commons---the
oceans, air and space. The U.S. Navy guarantees the openness of sea
lanes for civilian trade, for example. But according to Trump, the
United States should not do this for free. How much does he want? Well,
in 1988, he told Oprah Winfrey that Kuwait should pay the United States
25 percent of their oil profits because the United States "makes it
possible for them to sell it." If he were president, he said, "the
United States would make a hell of a lot of money from those nations
that have been taking advantage of us." In his 1987 letter, he wrote,
"Tax these wealthy nations, not America." What he has in mind is not
just other nations increasing their defense spending a modest amount or
sharing more of the burden. It is excessive tribute in exchange for
protection. There's a name for that. The sense that America is being
ripped off by its international relationships also shapes his view on
trade, which is probably the aspect of his foreign policy that has
received the most attention. Trump says he is in favor of trade, but he
has come out against every trade deal in living memory. [He calls NAFTA
a disaster and is a strident critic of]{.underline} the forthcoming
Trans-Pacific [Partnership. He wants to slap tariffs on other
countries]{.underline}---again [harking back to 19th-century
protectionism]{.underline}---and negotiate bilateral deals. Most
economists believe **[this would create a downward spiral in the global
economy]{.underline}**, but [Trump does not seem to care]{.underline}.
\*\*\* Of course, managing allies and partners is just one part of a
foreign policy. The other is dealing with rivals and enemies. Trump has
certainly cast himself as a ferocious critic of the Islamic State and
Iran, but he has a curious view of two countries---Russia and
China---that are not enemies but are perhaps better described as a rival
and a competitor, respectively. [For most makers of foreign policy, the
challenge posed by Russia and China is to U.S. allies and the U.S.-led
order]{.underline}, not to the U.S. homeland. [But since Trump does not
care as much about the allies, it is not surprising that he takes a more
lenient view]{.underline}. There is another factor that endears
authoritarian leaders to him---his respect for "strong" and "tough"
leaders. In 1990, he told Playboy that the last Soviet leader, Mikhail
Gorbachev, did not have a firm enough hand. Asked whether that meant he
favored China's crackdown on students, he said, "When the students
poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it.
Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with
strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now
perceived as weak \... as being spit on by the rest of the world." In
2015, Americans would find out that he had not changed his mind. In
December, Putin was asked for his views on Trump. The Russian leader
replied that Trump is "really brilliant and talented person, without any
doubt. It's not our job to judge his qualities, that's a job for
American voters, but he's the absolute leader in the presidential race.
\... He says he wants to move on to a new, more substantial
relationship, a deeper relationship with Russia, how can we not welcome
that? Of course we welcome that." For most American politicians, an
endorsement by a foreign leader, especially one who is hostile to the
United States, is something that could spell political disaster. So when
Trump appeared on "Morning Joe" the next day, the news media were
expecting him to try to limit the damage, perhaps with a stark
denunciation of Putin. Instead the exchange on "Morning Joe" went as
follows: Trump: When people call you "brilliant" it's always good,
especially when the person heads up Russia. Joe Scarborough: Well, I
mean, also is a person who kills journalists, political opponents and
\... Willie Geist: Invades countries. Scarborough: \... and invades
countries, obviously that would be a concern, would it not? Trump: He's
running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in
this country. Scarborough: But, again: He kills journalists that don't
agree with him. Trump: Well, I think that our country does plenty of
killing, too, Joe. It was a revealing exchange that did not end there.
In the weeks that followed, Trump would openly say that he thought he
would get along "just fine" with Russia. Putin could be a strong ally in
the war against ISIL. [For Putin, Trump would be a dream come true: an
American president who possesses views commensurate with
Putin]{.underline}'s own antiquated notion of great-power politics.
[[Putin would no longer]{.mark} have to [deal with a president committed
to]{.mark}]{.underline} wide-open [global [trade]{.mark}, NATO [and
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} close to his borders---the formula that
won the Cold War. Trump and Putin also have a similar interpretation of
recent history. In 1990, Trump believed Gorbachev had ruined Russia and
destroyed its economy, which is exactly what Putin meant when he
referred to the collapse of the Soviet Union as a tragedy. It's not hard
to imagine these two men sitting down to cut a deal, perhaps something
like Putin offering to help Trump on ISIL and Iran in exchange for
giving Putin a freer hand in Europe. Trump has said less about Chinese
president Xi Jinping except to call him very smart. It is clear, though,
that to him the main problem with China is not its aggressive actions in
the South China Sea, its attempts to blunt U.S. power projection
capabilities or its repression at home. Instead, Trump has made the
alleged Chinese economic threat a core part of his stump speech. He
accused China of devaluing its currency and even went so far as to say
it created the issue of climate change to gain an advantage over U.S.
manufacturing. He promised to slap tariffs on Chinese goods, although he
is vague about how much (he told the New York Times it could be as high
as 45 percent but subsequently rolled that back). U.S.-China relations
are about more than economics, of course. Given Trump's worldview, it is
easy to see how a deal might be struck. China would offer President
Trump an extraordinarily preferential economic deal and in exchange he
would leave China alone to do as it wished in the South China Sea and
East China Sea. After all, it would help American workers, at least in
the short term. America's allies would be upset, but a President Trump
might even see that as a bonus. \*\*\* Thus, beneath the bluster, the
ego and the showmanship is the long-considered worldview of a man who
has had problems with U.S. foreign policy for decades. Trump has thought
long and hard about America's global role and he knows what he wants to
do. [[There is]{.mark} virtually **[no chance]{.mark}** that [he
would]{.mark} "tack back to the center" and [embrace]{.mark} a
conservative [internationalist]{.mark} foreign
[policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [If he did get elected president, he would
do his utmost to **[liquidate the]{.mark} U.S.-led [liberal
order]{.mark}** by **[ending]{.mark} America's [alliances]{.mark}**[,
**closing the**]{.mark} **open global [economy]{.mark}**[, and **cutting
deals with Russia**]{.mark} **and China**.]{.underline} He would find
this hard to do, not least because the entire U.S. foreign policy
establishment would be opposed to him and he needs people to staff his
National Security Council, State Department and Defense Department. But
there is real power in the presidency, especially if there is clear
guidance about the chief executive's wishes. In any event, [the mere
fact that the American people would have elected somebody with a mandate
to destroy the U.S.-led order might be **sufficient to damage
it**]{.underline} beyond repair. After his election, [**[other countries
will immediately hedge]{.mark}** against the risk of abandonment. [There
will be **massive uncertainty**]{.mark} around America's commitments.
Would Trump defend the Baltics]{.underline}? Would he defend [the
Senkaku Islands? Or Saudi Arabia? Some [nations will give in]{.mark} to
China, Russia and Iran. [Others]{.mark}, like Japan, [will]{.mark} push
back]{.underline}, perhaps by **[[acquir]{.mark}ing [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Trump may well see such uncertainty as a
positive. Putting everything in play would give him great leverage. But
by undoing the work of Truman and his secretary of state, Dean Acheson,
it would be the end of the American era. [Some might think this is
overstated. After all, there have been other presidents who broke with
America's allies and renegotiated previous commitments]{.underline}. In
his first term, Richard Nixon was unwilling for the United States to
bear the cost of upholding the Bretton Woods economic system, so he
decided to unilaterally change the rules and make others pay, instead.
In 1971, faced with inflation and stagnation, he canceled the
convertibility of the dollar to gold without consulting his allies. This
brought a dramatic end to Bretton Woods. Nixon and his secretary of
state, Henry Kissinger, were also famously comfortable with strongmen
and authoritarian regimes. [But [Trump is no Nixon]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nixon had an acute sense of America's unique role in the international
order, even if he pursued it differently than his predecessors. He
strengthened America's alliances and maintained its commitments. Detente
with the Soviet Union and the opening with China were part of a
sophisticated strategy to create geopolitical space to gain an advantage
over the Soviets. [Trump]{.underline}, by contrast, [has offered no
vision of a U.S.-led order except that he wants to end it]{.underline}.

**[[Global threats mount]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and on top of the heap
a jester gesticulates, roars and guffaws. The [United States -- no, [the
world -- is in thrall to]{.mark} the Donald [Trump]{.mark} reality
show]{.underline}, on many days commanding more TV time and newsprint
than the rest of the candidates for the presidency combined. The
would-be leader of the free world has not spent a day, not an hour, on
public service The Celebrity Apprentice statesman has not served a
political apprenticeship of any kind. They love him for it. Cleansed by
wealth and fame, he has not been besmirched by active politics. It's
still unlikely, but no longer inconceivable, that he will be president.
Nate Silver of Fivethirtyeight, the man who generally calls it right on
how elections go, is still skeptical that he will win the nomination,
but much less so. He writes that "things are lining up better for Trump
than I would have imagined... it's not his continued presence in the
race that surprises me so much as the lack of a concerted effort to stop
him." The trouble is, the people who would stop him are the Republican
establishment. Politicianssss... hiss! What, then -- taking this a stage
further than Silver is yet prepared to do -- would President Trump find
when he reaches the Oval Office, and the files thud on to the desk (he
might, of course, sweep them to the floor and shout to his aides --
"**[Expel the Mexicans! Build that wall! Keep out the Muslims! Tell the
Chinese to get lost! Get that nice guy Putin over here]{.underline}**!).
But suppose he decided to govern. Trump's predecessor, whom he abused
daily, tried hard, in his first term, to "reset" relationships -- with
President Vladimir Putin of Russia (for which the phrase was coined);
with the leaders of the Middle East, deeply resentful over George W
Bush's war on terror; and when he arrived on the scene as president in
2012, Xi Jinping of China. He was very nice to the Europeans too --- I
attended a speech he gave in London's echoing, mediaeval Westminster
Hall in May 2011, when he declared that "there are few nations that
stand firmer, speak louder, and fight harder to defend democratic values
around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom." And he
clearly highly esteems Chancellor Angela Merkel, even if his spooks
likely hacked her cellphone. (More leaks this week from Edward Snowden's
trove of NSA documents claim to show they tapped Silvio Berlusconi's
phone when he was prime minister too -- especially when he was making
calls to Putin) Yet for his pains, he has given **[[Russia]{.mark}n [and
Chinese nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [powerful and scary
engines]{.underline}, both -- a shared doll in which to stick needles.
Putin, the world's most determined anti-westerner, gave a speech of
incendiary force in March 2014 -- saying that the Western states "prefer
not to be guided by international law in their practical policies but by
the rule of the gun... they act as they please...decid(ing) the
destinies of the world, that only they can ever be right." Pressing a
spring (Russia) to its limits was dangerous, he warned, for "it will
spring back hard." Since then, it has only got worse. It's a little
better with China, but not much. Xi's trip to talk to Obama in
Washington in September wasn't a shouting match but little was agreed --
little, that is, when set against the scale of the issues the two most
powerful states in the world have before them. Earlier this month, Xi
ordered the news media -- including foreign media working in China -- to
obey the Party dictates: he's closing up ranks as growth slows, and he
fears disaffection in the country and in a Party he is seeking to
cleanse. The West is a handy punch ball to which to divert aggression.
[Many of the leaders in the **[Middle East]{.mark}** whom Obama sought
to reassure are gone, swept away by the "Arab Spring]{.underline},"
which he lauded in the London speech. [Then the Spring itself was swept
away, and new autocrats appeared, or [chaos]{.mark} reigns.]{.underline}
The Europeans love him (except when a row over phone hacking erupts) --
but [the **[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion nearly [lost]{.mark}
its [currency]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is losing its no-internal-borders
policy and it is unable to be a full partner to the United States.
[[What has been lost]{.mark} in this? **Perhaps [the world
itsel]{.mark}f**]{.underline}. [The [challenges]{.mark} facing world
leaders]{.underline} now [[are]{.underline} **[greater than
anything]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the post-Cold War
period]{.underline}**. In a book out next month, [the Russian expert
Robert Legvold lists [some]{.mark} of them: they]{.underline}
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark} trying to master the rapidly approaching
**[[second nuclear age]{.mark},]{.underline}** [in which states with
aggressive intent toward their neighbors]{.underline}
(**[[Pakistan]{.mark} and [India]{.mark};]{.underline}** in the future,
perhaps, **[[Iran]{.mark} and [Israel]{.mark}; North [Korea
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** much of the rest **[of [the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**) [are seeking to build nuclear
arsenals.]{.underline} The list includes, too, [grasping the nettle of
**climate change**, realizing that it is already too late to **stop the
rise of the oceans** and the damage it will inflict]{.underline} on
mainly poor, low-lying countries -- and devising strategies to relieve
mass distress as well as to prevent the warming becoming still worse. It
contains [developing fruitful negotiations on the future of the Arctic,
which]{.underline} at present, it seems, **[Russia will unilaterally
militarize]{.underline}**. Political leaders have never operated as
globally as they do now; [**[the globe had]{.mark} never [been]{.mark}
so [threatened by massive destruction]{.mark} as it is now**; it has
never needed joint action, agreements with substance, an end to feuds,
as it does now. But we find ourselves, not in a new and hopeful era, but
in a **return to a cold war that could make the world cold and dead**.
While a man with a growing chance of being the leader of the free world
grins and waves and bellows -- "We're winning]{.underline}, winning,
winning the country, and soon the country is going to start winning,
winning, winning."

[[Trump's grand strat]{.mark}egy is]{.underline} thus [at odds with
longstanding traditions in American foreign policy and **[poses]{.mark}

[order]{.mark} that has underwritten U.S. security and prosperity for

Trump's grand [strat]{.mark}egy [is plagued by internal]{.mark} tensions
and [dilemmas]{.mark} that will make it difficult to achieve the
president's stated objectives. There are many problems, but here we
emphasize six.]{.underline}**

**[First, it will be [difficult]{.mark} for Trump [to reconcile]{.mark}
his [policies toward Russia and Iran]{.mark} on the one hand
[with]{.mark} his [desire to defeat]{.mark} the [I]{.mark}slamic
[S]{.mark}tate on the other]{.underline}**. [Trump's apparent desire to
go all-in with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} --- [and perhaps]{.underline} Syrian President
Bashar al-[Assad]{.underline} --- [to fight the Islamic
State]{.underline} in Syria **[is likely to backfire]{.underline}**.
President Barack
Obama [conditioned](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/10/12868556/us-russia-syria-agreement-explained) the
prospect of counterterrorism cooperation with Russia in Syria on Moscow
enforcing a nationwide cease-fire and ensuring humanitarian access for
the U.N. --- conditions the Kremlin was ultimately unable or unwilling
to meet. Moreover, during discussions with Moscow last fall, Obama
insisted that the United States would have a veto over Russian
targeting, that Assad's air force would be grounded over much of the
country, and that the parties should return to the negotiating table to
discuss a political transition. [If Trump chooses to cooperate with
Russia with no strings attached, it will make the United States
complicit in Russia's indiscriminate bombing campaign and its efforts to
prop up Assad]{.underline}. **[[This is a [recipe for
fueling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/opinion/russia-is-a-terrible-ally-against-terrorism.html?_r=1) ]{.mark}the
civil [war]{.mark} and jihadism, not combating it, [and]{.mark} it is
likely to [alienate]{.mark} precisely the [Sunni states]{.mark} Trump
hopes to join his anti-Islamic State coalition on the
ground.]{.underline}**

Then there is the issue of Iran. [In practice, [backing Russia]{.mark}
and Assad [means aligning]{.mark} --- whether openly or tacitly ---
[with Iran,]{.mark} its surrogate Hezbollah, and Iranian-backed Shiite
militias in Syria]{.underline}. **[This would effectively [strengthen
Iranian influence]{.mark} [in]{.mark} Syria and the broader
[region]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[the very opposite of what Trump
and his advisors desire]{.underline}**. [Consequently, if Trump means
what he says about taking a harder line against Iran --- both in the
context of the nuclear deal and vis-à-vis Iran's destabilizing behavior
across the Middle East --- he will have to try to convince Moscow to
sever its partnership with Tehran and attempt to box Iran and Hezbollah
out of Syria]{.underline}. That is easier said than done. Iran and
Hezbollah's tentacles in Syria run deeper than Russia's, and they have a
far greater stake in the outcome of that conflict than Moscow does. [The
[Iranians]{.mark} [are,]{.mark} therefore, [likely to react]{.mark} to
any overt effort to push them out by [playing an **active spoiler
role**]{.mark} that **undermines the campaign against the Islamic
State** and, potentially, puts at risk U.S. special operations forces
supporting counter-Islamic State opposition forces on the ground in
Syria.]{.underline}

**[A similar dilemma will face Trump in Iraq]{.underline}**. The United
States should work to balance and minimize Iranian influence in Iraq, in
particular by encouraging the Baghdad government to work overtime to
rein in Shiite popular mobilization forces (PMF). But **[an [overtly
hostile posture toward Iran]{.mark} (not to mention continued rants
about taking Iraq's oil) would [put Iraq]{.mark}'s Shiite Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi [in a jam, empowering]{.mark} his [rivals]{.mark} who
seek to distance Iraq from the United States]{.underline}**. [It
could]{.underline} also **[incentivize Iran to unleash Shiite PMF to
attack the approximately 5,000 American forces supporting the
counter-Islamic State campaign in Iraq, something Iran has refrained
from doing over the past two-and-a-half years. [The result]{.mark} could
be [dramatically]{.mark} increased U.S. casualties and [reduced American
influence]{.mark} in Baghdad.]{.underline}**

### 1AR\-\--Turn\-\--Impeachment\-\--A2: Pence Bad

#### Pence is better\-\--avoids war

**Mcmanus 17** (Doyle Mcmanus, American journalist, columnist, who
appears often on Public Broadcasting Service\'s Washington Week, May
21^st^, \"Should we wish for a President Pence?,\" La Times, Available

[President Mike Pence?]{.underline} [The question is way ahead of where
we are]{.underline}. There's no solid reason to expect that President
Trump will leave office before his term is done, whether by resignation,
impeachment or the untried mechanism of the 25th amendment. But that
hasn't stopped anyone from talking about it --- from Republicans wistful
for the days of a functional White House to Democrats trying to guess
which unpalatable future would be worse for their battered party. And
the answer should be straightforward. **[[Pence]{.mark} would be [an
improve]{.mark}ment on grounds of simple
[competence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[He [would make]{.mark} the
[country safer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Under a President Pence,
**[Americans [would have less cause to fear]{.mark} that [a blundering
president might lead us into war with No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [or
Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Progressives would find almost nothing to
like in Pence's domestic policies. There's no sugarcoating that. He
would be the most conservative president of modern times --- easily more
conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald Reagan, the right's
patron saint. He would be the most conservative president of modern
times --- easily more conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald
Reagan. His economic views are in line with orthodox Republicanism:
lower taxes, smaller government, fewer regulations. Pence's positions on
social issues spring from Christian conservatism: He's fiercely opposed
to abortion, gay marriage and almost any expansion of rights for gays,
lesbians and transgender people. [Despite all that,]{.underline} unlike
the president, [he has read the Constitution and understands its
meaning. **He would be less likely than Trump to try to pressure the FBI
to drop an investigation**, to take one example. He has even defended
freedom of the press]{.underline}. He was coauthor of a bill to protect
journalists from being compelled to identify their sources, and he
founded a bipartisan press freedom caucus --- along with, of all people,
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Glendale), now one of the top congressional
investigators pursuing Trump. "He's a person of real integrity," said
Rick Boucher, a former House member from Virginia who was the Democratic
coauthor of the bill to shield journalists. "He's very conservative,
especially on social issues. But he does have respect on the other side
of the aisle. [[He's very serious about public policy, and willing to
work with Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} where there's common
purpose."]{.underline} (That doesn't mean Boucher is ready to endorse
his old colleague for president. "I was a strong Obama supporter," he
said. "I won't sleep easy until there's a Democrat in the White House.")
To be sure, Pence already has questions to answer about his short tenure
as vice president. After Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Pence
vigorously parroted the White House's initial explanation that Comey was
cashiered based on a recommendation from the Justice Department. That
wasn't true --- and Pence may have known it wasn't true at the time.
Pence has also maintained that he didn't know Trump's first national
security advisor, Michael T. Flynn, was under investigation by the FBI
when he was appointed. That denial may turn out to be true. Even though
Pence was formally the chairman of Trump's transition, he wasn't in the
president-elect's inner circle when the initial staffing decisions were
made. There's plenty of evidence that even now, Trump aides spend much
of their time hiding important facts from each other. In any case, the
FBI's investigation of Flynn is likely to bring any discrepancies to
light. (In which case: President Paul Ryan? That's a matter for another
column.) As a matter of pure politics, it's impossible to predict
whether a President Pence could improve GOP prospects in the 2018
congressional election or win reelection himself in 2020. But Pence
represents a slice of his own party, the social conservative right,
which has never won a presidential nomination, let alone a general
election. (George W. Bush ran with their support, as did Mitt Romney,
but neither was as rooted among social conservatives as Pence.) He'd
have a lot of work to expand his appeal beyond the GOP base, to attract
independent Trump loyalists who might blame him for their man's
downfall, or spurn him as the kind of establishment politician they
abhor. And, if he were to become president, he'd come under immediate
pressure from those Trump loyalists to pardon his predecessor for any
crimes committed in office or during the campaign. The last time that
happened, when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon in 1974, it left
the new president vulnerable to a Democratic challenger. [It's
tempting]{.underline}, of course, for partisan Democrats [[to]{.mark}
say: [Let Republicans continue to struggle in the mess Trump
makes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Why give them a chance to right their ship?
The worse the better]{.underline}. [But that **[ignores the risks
that]{.mark} would [come from allowing Trump to continue
exercising]{.mark} the [powers of the presidency in]{.mark} both law
enforcement and [foreign policy]{.mark}**[. For the next three
years]{.mark}, given the limited alternatives, [I'd opt for President
Pence --- the sooner the better]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Pence would be more stable and his presidency is hamstrung by Trump hangover.

Pence" Five Thirty Eight \-- June 15 \--

Should dicier political times come, this adaptability might serve Pence
well as the winds of Washington shift away from Trump. His
steady-and-silent-as-a-rock [[persona]{.mark} [seems proof of his
political acumen]{.mark}]{.underline}, a persona calibrated to survive a
White House split by competing alliances. If the Trump presidency is a
war of attrition, Pence might be the best soldier in Washington;
avoiding the snares of Russia high drama could prove to be what leads
most directly to a Pence presidency. Pence's relatively low profile ---
he has taken foreign trips and is a congressional liaison for the White
House without attracting too much attention --- reminded me of
commandment No. 1 of Robert Greene's "48 Laws of Power," a treatise
popular in prison libraries: Never outshine the master. Pence, according
to survey data from the American National Election Studies, is more
popular among Republicans than the president, an unprecedented finding.
All this quiet work-horsing might be in service to commandment No. 3:
Conceal your intentions. In May, Pence filed to establish a PAC --- a
move that was met with many raised eyebrows and just as many quotes from
sources close to the vice president imploring the press not to read
anything about Pence's future political ambitions into it. In the event
of impeachment, Pence would likely be glad he started the PAC. Its
innocent purpose --- to support candidates who back Trump --- also
provides cover for Pence to develop allies in the party around the
country, to establish his own network, and to cultivate a quiet persona
not as Trump's man, but as a figure all his own. [If [Pence]{.mark} were
to go from vice president to accidental president, his
[administration]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [unfurl under the shadow
of]{.mark} [his predecessor]{.mark}]{.underline}. President
[[Pence's]{.underline}]{.mark} initial [[days]{.underline}]{.mark} and
weeks [in office]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} very likely
be [[focus]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} a task
similar to Gerald Ford's after Richard Nixon resigned: [[coaxing the
country through]{.mark} the [trauma]{.mark} of a transfer of
power]{.underline}. [Pence would]{.underline} need to find a way to shed
Trump's mantle without alienating the 45th president's base. One option
for his first few months: [spend [a great deal of energy]{.mark} [trying
to return]{.mark} a sense of [normalcy]{.mark} and calm]{.underline} to
a White House that has earned a reputation for infighting,
disorganization and turbulent relationships with foreign leaders.
**[[Pence is a far more predictable]{.mark} politician than
Trump]{.underline}**. As president, [[he would]{.underline}]{.mark} be
more eager than Trump has been to reaffirm the view, previously thought
to be conventional, of America as a willing party to NATO. Pence
recently [[reassure]{.underline}]{.mark}d [NATO [allies]{.mark} of
America's continued commitment to Article 5,]{.underline} a promise to
treat an attack on any member nation as an attack on all --- Trump
neglected to do so at a summit of NATO leaders.2

#### Pence prevents nuclear war -- outweighs whatever conventional war their turn assumes.

Pundits at every point on the political spectrum should be able to agree
that [there\'s at least [one respect]{.mark} in which America and
[the]{.mark} [world would be indisputably]{.mark} [better]{.mark} off
with the U.S. being [led by]{.mark} a President
[Pence]{.mark}]{.underline}: **[the [diminished]{.mark}
[likelihood]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} will [stumble into]{.mark} a
[nuclear conflagration]{.mark} with North Korea (or other powers) [due
to]{.mark} the president\'s [ineptitude]{.mark}, know-nothing
[bluster]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} digitally amplified [big
mouth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a member of Congress and governor of
Indiana, [[Pence may not]{.mark} [have]{.mark} distinguished himself for
his [geopolitical acumen]{.mark}, [but he does]{.mark} [seem]{.mark}
**[more likely]{.mark}** than the current inhabitant of the White House
[to follow]{.mark} the [counsel]{.mark} [of advisers]{.mark} who possess
the expertise to set and pursue broadly rational and consistent
policies.]{.underline} Coming just 14 years after a former Republican
governor lacking foreign policy experience invaded Iraq on the advice of
his staff, that might not sound very reassuring. But [as bad as the Iraq
War]{.underline} and its aftermath [proved to be]{.underline}, [there
really are worse possibilities]{.underline} --- and a **[nuclear
war]{.underline}** is undeniably one of them.
