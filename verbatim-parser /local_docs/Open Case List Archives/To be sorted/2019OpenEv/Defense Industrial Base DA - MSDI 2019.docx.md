#### U.S. still leading worldwide arms trade, but there are a multitude of factors that put us on the brink

Signs that President Donald Trump's "America First" policy could harm
U.S. businesses and curb the United States' clout around the world
surfaced this week in an unexpected place---a small town outside London,
during the world's largest civil and military air event. The biennial
gathering at the Farnborough International Airshow in the United Kingdom
brings together military officials, diplomats, and arms dealers from
around the world for plane-watching and deal-making. In other years, the
United States has sent the Defense Department's top weapons buyers, and
top-end American products, such as the F-35 stealth fighter jet, have
taken center stage. But this year's event is being held in the shadow of
[[Trump's]{.mark} most controversial policies: his [erratic approach to
foreign affairs]{.mark} and his economic protectionism, including steep
tariffs he has imposed on steel and aluminum. Those measures and the
resulting uncertainty [are prompting some European countries to go their
own way]{.mark} on major industry projects, including the development of
a next-generation fighter jet, **[potentially leaving U.S.]{.mark} firms
[behind.]{.mark}** "I think it is forcing Europe together in ways that
have unanticipated consequences for the U.S. defense
industry,"]{.underline} said Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha
Partners. **[[The]{.mark} aerospace and [defense industry is a huge
driver of U.S. jobs and economic growth]{.mark}. In 2017 alone, it
generated \$865 billion, supporting 2.4 million high-paying American
jobs.]{.underline}** [The industry produced a positive trade balance of
\$86 billion in 2017, the largest of any U.S. industry, which reduced
the country's trade deficit by 10 percent. **It is [also an important
component of U.S. foreign policy. Arms sales are key to strengthening
security partnerships and improving military cooperation with
allies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "Partners who procure American weaponry
are more capable of fighting alongside us and ultimately more capable of
protecting themselves with fewer American boots on the ground," Peter
Navarro, the White House director of trade policy,
[said](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) during an
April press conference. So it came as no surprise when the Trump
administration announced the decision to send a large delegation to help
sell U.S. products at Farnborough, including top officials such as
Navarro. The administration also used the opportunity to roll out the
Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy, also known as the "Buy America"
plan, an initiative to improve U.S. arms transfer processes and increase
the competitiveness of U.S.-made products. But the U.S. government
showing at Farnborough was disappointing from the start of the weeklong
exhibition Monday. Navarro pulled out at the last minute, as did Ellen
Lord, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer; Heidi Grant, the U.S. Air
Force's head of international affairs; and other U.S. government
officials. At the show itself, only five U.S. military aircraft appeared
on static display in the Defense Department corral that normally
showcases products built for the armed services by Lockheed Martin,
Boeing, and other U.S. defense giants. And though the administration has
touted new efforts to loosen restrictions on exports of armed unmanned
aerial vehicles built by U.S. manufacturers, the signature MQ-9 Reaper
drone made by the San Diego-based General Atomics was nowhere to be
found. ["It's the lowest number of aircraft in the U.S. corral I've ever
seen," said Joel Johnson, an analyst with the Teal Group. "There's this
huge push in theory to go sell American ... but the U.S. government
\[showing\] in all its majesty is the smallest I've seen in all my years
at trade shows."]{.underline} Navarro and the rest of the missing
officials cited other commitments, but the timing is suspect.
Farnborough came on the heels of an extraordinary [NATO
summit](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/12/trump-fumed-but-nato-members-got-what-they-wanted-nato-summit-brussels-defense-spending-alliance-tensions-transtlantic-relations-diplomacy-burden-sharing/),
where Trump rebuked U.S. allies for inadequate defense spending. During
a subsequent visit to England, Trump criticized British Prime Minister
Theresa May's Brexit strategy. The first day of the air show was
overshadowed by Trump's first official meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, where the U.S. president publicly challenged
the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered
in the 2016 presidential election. He backtracked a day later, saying he

The U.S. government officials who did show up, including Andrea
Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international
security, touted a larger-than-usual delegation and positive feedback
from both allies and industry partners. But even as they sought to
highlight American achievements, the potential long-term harm to U.S.
businesses was emerging in more subtle ways---for instance in Europe's
fighter jet market. The British Defense Ministry made a splash the first
day of Farnborough, unveiling a prototype of a [next-generation fighter
jet](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/1019523547411177473) that
will be built as a partnership between Britain's BAE Systems,
Rolls-Royce, and MBDA and Italy's Leonardo. The "Tempest" is planned to
replace the British Royal Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon starting in
2035. The Tempest will compete directly with later versions of Lockheed
Martin's F-35 for the European and potentially the Middle East markets,
as will the next-generation Franco-German fighter jet, the Future Combat
Air System (FCAS), announced in 2017. [Lockheed stands to lose billions
of dollars in F-35 sales over the next few decades if the stealth
fighter has to share the market with Tempest and FCAS]{.underline}. The
U.K. is planning to buy 138 F-35s for its Royal Air Force, but Callan
expects that the Brits will not procure the full complement of
jets---especially if it comes down to a choice between the F-35 and
Tempest. [Meanwhile, rumors abound that Italy is also considering
scaling back its planned purchase of 90 F-35 aircraft.]{.underline}
Lockheed is also pitching the F-35 in competitions to replace aging
fighter fleets in Germany, Canada, Belgium, Finland, and Switzerland.
Some experts are doubtful that the Tempest will be fielded on time given
Europe's poor track record on collaborating on combat aircraft. But
regardless, it's clear that [Trump's foreign and trade policies are
driving European nations to work together to protect their defense
capability and industrial base.]{.underline} "[European politics are
playing a major role in getting a next-gen fighter]{.underline}," said
Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. "Any hope for
internationalization of a future fighter has been Trumped." Meanwhile,
traditional U.S. allies are increasingly wary of American military
components. Several non-U.S. suppliers interviewed at Farnborough and at
the Royal International Air Tattoo in Fairford noted that customers are
increasingly ruling out components controlled by U.S. International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which covers virtually all U.S.
military subsystems. The problem is that a product with any
ITAR-controlled components---for instance a missile's GPS system---can
be sold only to countries approved by the U.S. government. This policy
effectively gives the United States a veto over many potential arms
sales, said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at
the International Institute for Strategic Studies. That's not all down
to Trump. ITAR restrictions have been a problem for contractors for
years. But the volatility and unpredictability of the Trump presidency
are not helping, said Gene Colabatistto, [the president of defense and
security at Canada's CAE. [U.S. allies are increasingly pushing to
become self-sufficient,]{.mark} he noted. "We are not going to stop
buying U.S. products, but we are going to protect ourselves," one
non-U.S. contractor told Foreign Policy.]{.underline} "I think the
question is: Is this a short blip in trans-Atlantic relations, or is it
something more of a fundamental shift?" Barrie said. "My view is that we
just don't know yet." Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security, said in an interview with FP that
she encourages allies to express their concerns directly. But she did
not offer much reassurance. "We are always going to stand up for what's
best for the American people. We are always going to defend what's best
for American industry," she said. To be sure, [the administration can
point to recent successes in arms sales and global defense spending.
Thompson noted that U.S. foreign military sales for fiscal year 2018,
pegged at almost \$47 billion, have already surpassed last year's total
of \$42 billion]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the United States has so far
this year nabbed \$112 billion in direct commercial sales of arms. Those
numbers are trending up, she stressed. And U.S. allies are getting
products faster than in previous administrations. For example, on the
second day of the show, the Netherlands signed a long-awaited deal to
[purchase](https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/farnborough/2018/07/17/netherlands-signs-deal-for-unarmed-mq-9-reaper-drones/)
four Reaper drones. The \$339 million sale had been in the works since
2003. "We can shave weeks, months, and sometimes years off that timeline
without compromising oversight, without compromising human rights,
without compromising all those important vetting safety nets," she said.
Thompson also defended the president's comments at the recent NATO
summit, noting that she had received positive feedback from many of her
counterparts, who wanted help getting their governments to agree to
increase defense spending. "I wouldn't call it 'anti-NATO,'" she said of
the president's harsh rhetoric. "Candidly, the president has put some
pressure on our partners to step up their spending, and we've seen it in
the last year and a half---the numbers are there." Eric Fanning, the
president of the Aerospace Industries Association and former U.S. Army
Secretary, believes **[[the]{.mark} U.S. aerospace [industry is robust
enough to withstand the current geopolitical environment. But]{.mark} he
stressed in an interview that [the industry can't take its dominance for
granted.]{.mark} "Even though we are proud of where we are today and
where the trajectory seems to be taking us, [we can't be
complacent,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanning said.

#### Aff decreases arms sales which create and sustain global partnerships and U.S. leadership abroad

Derek **Reveron**, AUGUST 28, 20**12**, Reveron, an Atlantic Council
contributing editor, is a Professor of National Security Affairs and the
EMC Informationist Chair at the U.S. Naval War College, "Soft Power
through Hard Power Weapon Sales", Atlantic Council, 6-3-2019,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/soft-power-through-hard-power-weapon-sales,
MJD

In a Congressionally-mandated report, [Richard F. Grimmett and Paul K.
Kerr](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R42678.pdf)recently detailed
global arms transfer agreements in 2011 of \$85.3 billion, which is
greater than the economic activity of 119 countries and tops the defense
budget of every single country in the world save the United States and
China. The United States accounts for \$66.3 billion of the arms
agreements, while Russia ranked a distant second with \$4.8 billion.
Grimmett and Kerr note **[the number of sales is historically high "due
primarily to the unusually large agreements value of the US contracts
with Saudi Arabia\--the international arms market is not likely growing
overall..."]{.underline}** They add, "Concerns over their domestic
budget problems have led many purchasing nations to defer or limit the
purchase of new major weapons systems." Ground forces tend to benefit
most from new deliveries of tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, and
missile systems. However, several countries committed to purchasing
high-cost aircraft, which helps explain why weapons sales are so high.
From 2008-11, the United States accounted for 56 percent of arms
agreements, overshadowing European countries (16 percent), Russia (13
percent), and China (3 percent). While China is a major manufacturing
power, it still lacks a competitive weapons industry and cannot compete
globally on major weapon systems. In fact, China still relies on Russia
to supply aircraft engines. With steady economic growth from the energy
sector coupled with heightened concerns over Iran's nuclear weapons
program, it is none too surprising that Middle Eastern countries
purchase the most weapons. Likewise, without an indigenous weapons
industry like Brazil, countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iraq are
reliant on arms imports. Thus, Saudi Arabia will significantly upgrade
its F-15 fleet; UAE will field new missile defense systems, and Iraq and
Oman will purchase F-16s. [**These [purchases indicate]{.mark} not only
real [concern about Middle East stability but are also a good indication
that these governments want long-term partnerships with the United
States.]{.mark} With weapon sales come training, maintenance plans, and
integration into US-led exercises.** [Outside of direct economic
benefits of arms sales, the United States gains partners for global
military operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without aircraft like the F-16
and Mirage-2000, UAE could not have participated in [Libyan air
operations](http://arabianaerospace.aero/uae-air-force-on-the-offensive-in-libya.html).
With its new C-17 cargo aircraft, India will be able to better deploy
and sustain its 10,000 UN peacekeepers around the world. [New Persian
Gulf missile defense radars enhance United States efforts to limit
Iran's military options to strike with ballistic missiles. And for every
F-35 Japan buys, the United States can field one fewer in Northeast
Asia]{.underline}. As the 2012 US defense guidance noted, **[["Building
partnership capacity]{.mark} elsewhere in the world also [remains
important for sharing the costs and responsibilities of global
leadership. Across the globe we will seek to be the security partner of
choice." Weapons sales also illustrate a commitment by the United States
to improve partners' efforts to strengthen their own
defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Since the early 2000s, the
list of security partners has grown considerably and only a dozen
countries in the world are excluded from US [security
cooperation](http://www.amazon.com/Exporting-Security-International-Engagement-Cooperation/dp/1589017080/ref=la_B001H6O1JM_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1346159673&sr=1-2)
relationships. However, the non-exclusive list of partners is not
without costs. Some partners over-interpret agreements believing they
are in alliance with the United States, while military relationships at
any cost can undermine broader strategic goals. [Walter
Pincus](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/doing-business-with-despots/2012/08/27/85d5a328-ed49-11e1-b09d-07d971dee30a_story.html)captured
this sentiment arguing, "Washington's apparent support \[of
authoritarian regimes\] clouds the democratic values message that the
United States is trying to send around the world." Thus, the challenge
for the United States is to be willing to break with its security
partners when political circumstances change, deny certain capabilities
that would upset domestic or regional balances of power, and moderate
activities if new security dilemmas are created through weapon sales.  

#### US leadership is empirically the most stable system and deters all conflict\-\--decline causes transition wars

[Think of two significant trend lines in the world today. One is the
increasing ambition and activism of the two great **revisionist powers,
Russia and China**. The other is the declining confidence, capacity, and
will of the democratic world, and especially of the United States, to
maintain the dominant position it has held in the international system
since 1945]{.underline}. As those two lines move closer, [[as the
declining]{.mark} will and [capacity of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies to maintain the present world order
meet]{.mark} the increasing desire and capacity of the [revisionist
powers]{.mark} to change it, we will reach the moment at which [the
existing order collapses]{.mark} and the world descends [into]{.mark} a
phase of **[brutal anarchy]{.mark}**, as it has three times in the past
two centuries. The cost of that descent, in lives and treasure, in lost
freedoms and lost hope, will be staggering.]{.underline} Americans tend
to take the fundamental stability of the international order for
granted, even while complaining about the burden the United States
carries in preserving that stability. History shows that [[world orders
do collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, and [when they do [it
is]{.mark} often **[unexpected, rapid, and
violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The late 18th century was the high point
of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the continent fell suddenly into
the abyss of the Napoleonic Wars. [[In the first decade of the 20th
century]{.mark}, [**the world's smartest minds predicted an end** to
great-power conflict]{.mark} as revolutions in communication and
transportation knit economies and people closer together. [The most
devastating war]{.mark} in history [came four years
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The apparent calm of the postwar
1920s became the crisis-ridden 1930s and then another world war. Where
exactly we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines
are to that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we
three years away from a global crisis, or 15? [That [we are]{.mark}
somewhere [on that path]{.mark}, however, is unmistakable.]{.underline}
And while it is too soon to know what effect Donald Trump's presidency
will have on these trends, early signs suggest that the new
administration is more likely to hasten us toward crisis than slow or
reverse these trends. The further accommodation of Russia can only
embolden Vladimir Putin, and the tough talk with China will likely lead
Beijing to test the new administration's resolve militarily. Whether the
president is ready for such a confrontation is entirely unclear. For the
moment, he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications
of his rhetoric and his actions. [[China and Russia are **classic
revisionist powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although both have never
enjoyed greater security from foreign powers than they do today ---
Russia from its traditional enemies to the west, China from its
traditional enemy in the east --- [they are [dissatisfied with
the]{.mark} current [global configuration of power. Both seek to
restore]{.mark} the [hegemonic dominance]{.mark} they once enjoyed in
their respective regions. [For]{.mark} [China, that means **dominance of
East Asia**]{.mark}, with countries like [Japan, South Korea]{.mark},
and the nations of Southeast Asia both acquiescing to Beijing's will and
acting in conformity with China's strategic, economic, and political
preferences.]{.underline} That includes American influence withdrawn to
the eastern Pacific, behind the Hawaiian Islands. [[For Russia, it
means]{.mark} **hegemonic influence in [Central and Eastern
Europe]{.mark}** and Central Asia, which Moscow has traditionally
regarded as either part of its empire or part of its sphere of
influence. Both Beijing and Moscow seek to redress what they regard as
an unfair distribution of power]{.underline}, influence, and honor [in
the U.S.-led postwar global order.]{.underline} As autocracies, [both
feel threatened by the dominant democratic powers in the international
system]{.underline} and by the democracies on their borders. Both regard
the United States as the principal obstacle to their ambitions, and
therefore [b[oth **seek to weaken** the American-led]{.mark}
international security [order]{.mark} that stands in the way of their
achieving what they regard as their rightful destinies.]{.underline} It
was good while it lasted [Until fairly recently, Russia and China have
faced considerable, almost insuperable, obstacles in achieving their
objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the
international order itself and its principal promoter and defender. The
American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in
the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China
and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as "situations of
strength" that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously
and, since the end of the Cold War, to defer serious efforts to disrupt
the international system. [The system has checked their
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} in both positive and negative ways.
[[During]{.mark} the era of [American primacy, China and Russia
have]{.mark} [participated in and]{.mark} for the most part [been
beneficiaries of the open **international economic system** the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [created]{.mark} and helps sustain; [so
long as that system functions, **they have**]{.mark} **had [more to gain
by playing in it ]{.mark}**[than by]{.mark} challenging and [overturning
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political and strategic aspects of the
order, however, have worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy
of democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of
Soviet communism posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in
Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold
War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions ---
especially the geographical advance of liberal democracies close to
their borders --- as an existential threat. That's for good reason:
Autocratic powers since the days of Klemens von Metternich have always
feared the contagion of liberalism. The mere existence of democracies on
their borders, the global free flow of information they cannot control,
the dangerous connection between free market capitalism and political
freedom --- all pose a threat to rulers who depend on keeping restive
forces in their own countries in check. The continual challenge to the
legitimacy of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported democratic order
has therefore naturally made them hostile both to that order and to the
United States. But, until recently[, a preponderance of domestic and
international forces has dissuaded them from confronting the order
directly. Chinese rulers have had to worry about what an unsuccessful
confrontation with the United States might do to their legitimacy at
home]{.underline}. Even [Putin has pushed only against open doors, as in
Syria, where the United States responded passively to his probes. He has
been more cautious when confronted by even marginal U.S. and European
opposition, as in Ukraine. [The greatest check]{.mark} on Chinese and
Russian ambitions [has been]{.mark} the [military and **economic power**
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies in Europe and Asia.
[China]{.mark}, although increasingly powerful, [has had to contemplate
facing the]{.mark} combined [military and economic strength of]{.mark}
[the world's superpower]{.mark} and some very formidable regional powers
linked by alliance or common strategic interest --- including Japan,
India, and South Korea]{.underline}, as well as smaller but still potent
nations like Vietnam and Australia. [Russia has had to face the United
States and its NATO allies. When united, these U.S.-led alliances
present a daunting challenge to a revisionist power that can call on few
allies of its own for assistance]{.underline}. Even [were the Chinese to
score an early victory in a conflict, such as the military subjection of
Taiwan or a naval battle in the South or East China Sea, [they would
have to contend]{.mark} over time [with the]{.mark} **combined
industrial productive capacities** of some of the world's **[richest and
most technologically advanced nations]{.mark}** and the likely cutoff of
access to foreign markets on which their own economy
depends.]{.underline} A weaker Russia, with its depleted population and
oil- and gas-dependent economy, would face an even greater challenge.
For decades, [[the strong global position enjoyed by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies has **discouraged any serious
challenge**]{.mark}. So long as the United States was perceived as a
dependable ally, [Chinese and Russian leaders feared that aggressive
moves would backfire]{.mark} and possibly bring their regimes
down.]{.underline} This is what the political scientist William
Wohlforth once described as the inherent stability of the unipolar
order: As [dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions. And it worked. The United States stepped up,
and Russia and China largely backed down]{.underline} --- or were
preempted before acting at all. Faced with these obstacles, [the best
option for the two revisionist great powers has always been to hope for
or, if possible, engineer a weakening of the U.S.-supported world order
from within, either by separating the United States from its allies or
by raising doubts about the U.S. commitment]{.underline} and thereby
encouraging would-be allies and partners to forgo the strategic
protection of the liberal world order and seek accommodation with its
challengers. [[The present system has]{.mark} therefore
[depended]{.mark} **not only [on American power]{.mark} but on
[coherence and unity]{.mark}** at the heart of the democratic world.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has had to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order]{.mark}, especially in the military and
strategic realm, but [the order's]{.mark} ideological and **[economic
core]{.mark}** --- the democracies of Europe and East Asia and the
Pacific --- [has]{.mark} also [had to remain]{.mark} relatively
[healthy]{.mark} and confident.]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Defense Industry on Brink

#### Multitude of risks that put US defense industry in trouble- must focus on maintaining global ties

Robin **Lineberger 2018**, Lineberger is the leader of Deloitte's
Aerospace & Defense industry practice, "2019 global aerospace and
defense industry outlook", Deloitte,
<https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-mfg-2019-global-a-and-d-sector-outlook.pdf>,
MJD

[In 2018, the global aerospace and defense (A&D) industry recuperated
and experienced a solid year]{.underline} as passenger travel demand
strengthened and [global military expenditure continued to
rise.]{.underline}1 The [industry is expected to continue its growth
trajectory in 2019, led by]{.underline} growing commercial aircraft
production and **[strong defense spending]{.underline}**. In the
commercial aerospace sector, aircraft order backlog remains at an
all-time high2 as demand for next-generation, fuel-efficient aircraft
continues to surge with the rise in oil prices. With the aircraft
backlog at its peak, manufacturers are expected to ramp up production
rates, hence, driving growth in the sector. However, manufacturers could
experience supply chain interruptions as some suppliers may struggle to
increase production to keep up with the growing backlog. **[[In the
defense sector, heightened global tensions and geopolitical risks,
recovery in the US defense budget, and higher defense spending by
other]{.mark} major regional [powers such as China, India, and Japan are
expected to drive global]{.mark} defense [sector growth in 2019 and
beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}[3Geopolitical tensions are
continuing to intensify and demand for military equipment is on the
uptick, driving defense spending across the globe]{.underline}.6Since
the beginning of the Trump era, defense budgets in the United States
have been on the rise; and, the new administration's increased focus on
strengthening the nation's military is expected to keep defense spending
on the higher side in 2019 as well. NATO countries also appear to be
focusing on increasing defense budgets to counter potential threats from
Russia and the Middle East. Moreover, there has been growth in defense
spending from other nations, such as India, China, and Japan, because of
enduring security threats. Apart from this, heightened geopolitical
tensions in the Middle East and North Korea are creating strong demand
for military equipment, which is expected to be one of the key drivers
of defense sector growth in the near term. Although traditional threats
(land, maritime, and air-based) continue to emerge, technological
advancements and digitization have also led to cyber-related threats.
[To be prepared for the future, [military strategies]{.mark} worldwide
[are evolving]{.mark}, and nations are aiming at integrating digital
tools and technologies to manage both traditional and digital-age
threats]{.underline}. **[This [has resulted in a]{.mark} bigger [focus
on]{.mark} many [cybersecurity]{.mark} programs, which are expected to
play a vital role in the near term.]{.underline}** **[Moreover, [space
is becoming a]{.mark}n important [part of the]{.mark} overall [defense
industry]{.mark} ecosystem]{.underline}** as growing global tensions
could pose a threat to space assets such as satellites, which are often
relied upon for military operations including surveillance,
communications, and missile targeting. Because it has become important
to shield these assets, this may lead to the militarization of space.
The United States, China, and Russia have already begun establishing
dominance in space, with other countries, such as North Korea and India,
gradually following them[. **[Changes in]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the
international [trade]{.mark} agreements [likely to disrupt the global
supply chain and increase costs]{.mark}** Free trade is important to the
A&D industry as aircraft and arms exports drive revenue
growth,]{.underline} especially for companies from the developed world.
For instance, A&D is the leading net exporting industry in the United
States, which generated a net trade surplus of US\$86 billion in 2017.[7
But there is a possibility that brewing transatlantic and transpacific
trade tensions could affect this as duties being placed on steel and
aluminum impact companies' bottom lines]{.underline}. **[Import tariffs
on aluminum and steel---key raw materials imported by A&D manufacturers
in the production of aircraft, missiles, rockets, tankers, etc.---will
likely increase manufacturing costs and impact
profitability.]{.underline}** Defense companies that primarily sell to
foreign governments and rely on relationships could be more adversely
affected. With retaliatory tariffs being imposed, some A&D companies
could consider moving their manufacturing to avoid tariffs for products
manufactured and exported from their home countries, disrupting supply
chains and delaying deliveries. **[[A&D companies operating in this
environment of uncertainty will do well by nurturing long-term stable
partnerships across the industrial base and managing their global supply

To keep pace with new entrants, companies must focus on innovation. In
2017, examining the dynamics of the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector[,
we [emphasized the need for global companies to focus on building
relationships with defense agencies around the world]{.mark}. We said
they should seek entrées into new lucrative markets even as their [U.S.
and E.U. business remains flat.]{.mark} That assessment is still
pertinent in 2018[, even in the face of expanded U.S. defense budgets.
There are many uncertainties]{.mark} surrounding how that money will be
spent.]{.underline} For example, will the Pentagon return to the days of
traditional long-term weapons development programs? Or will it take the
more likely course of pursuing new partners --- either legacy players or
nontraditional entrants --- that can invest in creative technology
solutions and deliver them faster and cheaper? **[[Another uncertainty
involves the European Ministers of Defense]{.mark}, who are joining
together as a bloc to increase investments in military
equipment.]{.underline}** Digitizing the armed forces and lowering
procurement expenditures on big ticket items are priorities for them.
Will this change leave A&D companies following traditional paths of
product development out in the cold? [A global strategy built upon their
own innovation and capabilities is the most viable path for most
companies in this industry]{.underline}. But is that feasible? For some
time now, defense contracting has been among the most risk-averse
sectors, often opting to return capital to shareholders via share
buybacks and dividend payouts, leaving research and development wanting.
Indeed, in absolute numbers, the global A&D industry spends much less on
research and development than other critical sectors. In terms of
innovation intensity (the percentage of sales earmarked for R&D), its
spending is also comparatively low --- just 4.1 percent. (In Europe,
it's a bit higher, at 5.1 percent; in the U.S., it's 3.6 percent.) To be
sure, these aerospace and defense R&D budgets are on par with those of
the auto industry when viewed as a percentage of sales, but they greatly
trail expenditures made by technologically intensive companies, which
have begun to enter this sector. [[Slow-walking R&D efforts has never
been a recipe for long-term success,]{.mark} and some of the significant
threats confronting the A&D industry show why that's even more true in
2018]{.underline}. Commercial technology entrants have large and growing
workforces dedicated to developing new technologies and can innovate
rapidly. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan, a 30-year
veteran of Boeing, has spoken about the [[potential
technology-deficit]{.mark} that [defense companies must
address]{.mark}.]{.underline} They may have once ruled the military
equipment landscape and even led in innovation but that doesn't insulate
them from hungrier, more determined competitors. SpaceX, founded in
2002, exemplifies this group. Elon Musk's company designs, manufactures,
and launches advanced rockets, covering a range of activities that in
the past could have been shared by a variety of defense contractors. And
in its short life, SpaceX has already proven its ability to disrupt the
defense business with a breakthrough that allows it to recover and reuse
booster sections. And while Western A&D companies battle new entrants at
home[, [countries]{.mark} in other regions are expanding their defense
capabilities and industries, [hoping to erode the technological
edge]{.mark} that legacy [Western companies]{.mark} and countries [have
historically enjoyed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[Some]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of them may [become formidable
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Recent reports indicate that China is
making a big push to develop military artificial intelligence
technologies, and China and Russia are developing sophisticated
air-to-air missile systems that use advanced imagery and sensors to
thwart enemy intrusions before they pierce the skies. [As a result of
these pressures, executives at large A&D companies must confront a
critical imperative: change how you make decisions about capital
expenditures and R&D spending to increase support for new technologies
and partnerships with the goal of designing and engineering new products
more quickly]{.underline}. In other words, adopt a more rigorous and
less risk-averse approach to evaluating and making strategic investment
choices (for example, product development, technology innovation, and
R&D) that yield long-term value. Accept uncertainty as part of the
normal course of business; view it as an opportunity, not a danger. At
the same time, collaborate with defense customers to tap into technology
innovation outside the A&D industry and adapt it to future platforms
rather than developing bespoke solutions. We have already begun to see
some movement in this direction, though not enough. [Some U.S. A&D
companies are using a sudden influx of free cash from massive tax cuts
to widen R&D spending and investments in other capital
assets]{.underline} (although many are still designating much of the
windfall for shareholder payoffs that do little for future product
development). For instance, in 2018, Northrop Grumman plans to increase
capital expenditures by 11 percent and Raytheon says it is upping
capital spending by 50 percent. [Lockheed Martin says it intends to
invest in new weapons development, while not providing any dollar
figures. But these announcement are relatively few, limited to American
companies and don't specify how much, if any, of the increased spending
will go directly to R&D, as opposed to other typical capital
investments.]{.underline} In addition, some defense outfits have
developed unorthodox innovation strategies to jumpstart new programs
that formerly would not have been in their wheelhouse. The U.S.-based
Sierra Nevada Corporation teamed up with Brazil's Embraer Defense &
Security to retrofit Embraer's battle hardened A-29 light attack
aircraft for the U.S. Air Force and other air forces worldwide. This
contract grew out of a USAF effort to procure equipment with minimal and
more rapid development work than traditionally required. Airbus has
launched a new digital program called Quantum, which among other things
seeks to create new business models around advanced technology. One of
Airbus' initial Quantum efforts is the development of highly complex
commercial drones to buttress its military unmanned device product
lines. Other A&D companies are explicitly trying to establish themselves
as digital leaders through M&A or partnerships. Thales has acquired
Dutch-based Gemalto for more than US\$5 billion, a deal that cements
Thales' new strategic vision in this sphere. Gemalto is a major player
in cybersecurity products, and Thales has been on a buying binge
recently to open up new revenue streams from technology. Boeing Defense,
Space & Security has joined with Saab Group to build a production
aircraft that provides the U.S. Air Force with a new, advanced pilot
training system that could replace the T-38 in the Air Force's T-X
training program. The project is notable in that Boeing broke a norm by
investing its own resources in R&D. Some companies, such as Lockheed
Martin (LM) are using venture funds to focus their long-term, strategic
investments on technology innovation. LM's fund invests in early-stage
technology companies that are involved in autonomous systems and
robotics, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, advanced electronics,
and sensor technologies. No A&D company can avoid the need to be much
more nimble and forward-thinking than they've been in the past.
Companies must determine how to allocate capital to build
differentiating capabilities, address current and future customer needs,
help customers innovate, and, of course, maximize shareholder returns.
How can they develop an investment strategy to meet these goals? A good
starting point is a more disciplined approach to valuing strategic
options. This involves analyzing specific financial indicators (such as
cash flows or intrinsic value) generated by the company's current
strategy, versus other strategic options. The cash flow can then be used
to develop advanced products, instead of simply returning capital to
shareholders. A&D companies should ensure that their approach to
strategic investment decisions incorporates the following elements: A
disciplined approach to managing capital investments as a portfolio of
options, based on returns and on the drivers of intrinsic value. This
includes a dynamic valuation of strategic options and trade-offs
(potentially incorporating decision-tree analysis, what-if scenarios,
and an analysis of real option value in a range of plausible future
environments). Agility in the face of market uncertainty through a
dynamic strategy process that is not constrained by annual
financial-planning cycles. Reducing expenses by ruthlessly focusing on
the assets, markets, business portfolio, technology, and core
capabilities that provide the company's competitive advantage. (We call
this a fit-for-growth program.) Too often, R&D funds are allocated to
business units, letting them decide what to do with the money, rather
than earmarked to fund specific priorities. Incentive and compensation
programs that reward executives for investment decisions that result in
successful innovation and improved competitive advantage. The
traditional approach of offering bonuses for meeting annual performance
objectives --- equity returns, earnings, and the like --- is
counterproductive because executives can achieve these goals while
actually destroying value in the company by, for instance, seeking
savings through cutbacks in R&D. Changes in the corporate culture. [The
average defense contractor's workforce is skewed to a middle-aged
demographic that is strong in developing and maintaining proprietary
systems, but does not have the tech aptitude that increasingly drives
weapons equipment efforts and advances today.]{.underline} In those
areas where commercial industries --- particularly technology companies
--- may be several years ahead, defense contractors shouldn't try to
catch up on their own. They must realize that the government will
purchase commercial products that are not proprietary in order to take
advantage of their potential applications more quickly. To address this,
defense contractors should partner with startups to adopt new
technologies the A&D companies need. Acquisitions and venture
capital--style investments are also possible in this realm. Boeing,
Airbus, LM, and Raytheon have all bought interests in high-tech firms,
working in areas that include cybersecurity, integrated circuits,
drones, small electric airplanes, and augmented reality. **[[The A&D
sector is clearly at a crossroads]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And it is an
especially challenging juncture because in recent years the industry has
tended to pull in its horns rather than be bold and daring. Companies
can choose either road, but only one --- the one that requires companies
to be less risk-averse --- leads to a lucrative future.

### UQ\-\--US Lead in Sales

#### Trump's foreign policy stance and increased regulations has put US dominance over arms sales at risk- further restrictions would push it over the brink

The Trump administration
recently [released](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) its
[new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy designed to increase the
already well-established U.S. dominance of the global arms
market.]{.underline} Increasing arms exports is seen as an important
part of the administration's aim to strengthen America's economy and
security. Traditionally, [**[U.S. arms exports have been used as tools
of power and influence, giving it political leverage over
clients]{.mark}.** Paradoxically,
[however]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [the emphasis placed on the
economic utility of arms sales by [the Trump administration is
increasing the bargaining power of clients,]{.mark} thereby [reducing
U.S. political sway.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The leverage of client states
and the U.S. arms industry is leading the administration to release
advanced military capabilities earlier than it would have done
otherwise]{.underline} and to play down human rights considerations
raised by Congress. Ironically, [additional economic and security steps
being taken by the Trump administration may be undermining some of the
intended benefits of the new CAT policy.]{.underline} [**[The
president's economic protectionist agenda]{.mark}, including the
imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum supposedly because of
national security considerations, [could undermine U.S. defense
sales]{.mark} by driving up prices or by prompting retaliation from
affected arms clients.** [Political tensions]{.mark} between Washington
and some its allies and partners -- [especially in NATO --- may
also]{.mark} be encouraging them to find ways to [decrease their
dependence on American-made]{.mark} sub[systems]{.mark} and to increase
defense industrial cooperation between them to the exclusion of the
United States.]{.underline} **[[This could]{.mark} potentially [reduce
future U.S. arms]{.mark} and subsystem [sales]{.mark} to these countries
[and increase competition]{.mark} with them [for global
markets]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Trump's Conventional Arms Transfer
Policy The first CAT policy was
[introduced](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=7530) by
President Jimmy Carter on May 19, 1977. Its underlying principle was
that arms transfers were to be treated with a strong presumption of
denial "as an exceptional foreign policy implement" with "the burden of
persuasion ... on those who favor a particular sale, rather than those
who oppose it." To further this policy of self-imposed restraint, Carter
instituted a ceiling on the total dollar value of American arms
transfers to all but a few traditional allies. He pledged that the
United States would not be the first supplier to introduce into Third
World areas "newly developed, advanced weapons systems which could
create a new or significantly higher combat capability." In implementing
this policy, Carter
[issued](http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/Arms-Transfers-and-Trade-Carter-and-reagan.html)
the so-called "leprosy letter," instructing American diplomats abroad to
refrain from assisting the U.S. arms industry in its efforts to secure
foreign buyers. In April, the Trump administration
[launched](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) the
fifth iteration of the CAT policy, designed to increase the exports of
U.S. arms as an integral part of its "America First" policy agenda. The
present version of the CAT policy prioritizes arms transfers as an
[important
tool](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)
of American foreign policy and, in stark contrast to the vision of
Carter, is predicated on a strong assumption of approval and the active
advocacy of the U.S. government and its diplomats with foreign leaders
and governments to buy American-made arms. [The Trump administration
[presents](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)
its new arms policy as a response to the ongoing strategic competition
between the great powers. Its argument is that the new CAT policy will
enable Washington to preserve international peace by strengthening the
military capabilities of its allies]{.underline} and partners, while
reducing the need for American boots on the ground; maintaining its
influence over the policies and actions of client states in key regions
around the world; strengthening the U.S. military by increasing
interoperability with allies and partners; supporting the defense
industry; promoting new innovation; and maintaining American jobs. The
new policy also refers to the need for an assessment of the risks that
arms transfers may pose to human rights violations, to technology
transfer issues and/or U.S. nonproliferation objectives. The Nervous
U.S. Domination of the Arms Market [[The United States dominates
the]{.mark} growing [global arms market]{.mark} and according to data
gathered by the authoritative [Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri)
(SIPRI), its lead is expanding.]{.underline} The United States accounted
for 34 percent of total arms exports between 2013 and 2017, ranking it
significantly higher than its main competitors Russia (22 percent),
France (6.7 percent), Germany (5.8 percent), China (5.7 percent), and
Britain (4.8 percent). In FY 2018, [the value of signed arms deals
continued to
increase](https://breakingdefense.com/2018/07/the-u-s-has-already-sold-more-weapons-this-year-than-all-of-2017/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ebb%207/17/18&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief),
reaching over \$46 billion, exceeding the \$41 billion figure of FY
2017. [Undergirding this policy is Trump's vision that economic security
is national security. The defense and aerospace industry is
America's]{.underline} [[second-largest gross
exporter.]{.underline}](https://www.defensenews.com/top-100/2018/08/09/its-time-to-update-us-defense-export-policies/)
[The industry
[contributes](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)
approximately \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and employs
[around 2,500,000
people](https://www.defensenews.com/top-100/2018/08/09/its-time-to-update-us-defense-export-policies/)]{.underline}.
**[On average, [30 percent of the industry's annual
revenue](https://www.defensenews.com/top-100/2018/08/09/its-time-to-update-us-defense-export-policies/)
is through arms exports, which reduces the need for domestic investment,
reduces the cost-per-unit for the U.S. military, and enables an increase
of investments in innovation, thereby retaining America's technological
lead. [However, a number of trends combine to make Washington nervous
about its lead in global arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
[The first is a growing effort by other technologically innovative arms
exporters to compete with the United States for markets]{.underline}.
Arms sales by
[Britain](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/08/08/uk-reports-massive-uptick-in-defense-exports/),
[France](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/08/02/french-armed-forces-minister-reveals-arms-export-details-roadblocks-to-lawmakers/),
[Spain](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-saudi-warships/spain-signs-2-2-billion-framework-deal-to-sell-warships-to-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN1HJ2D5),
[China](https://www.janes.com/article/79923/wraps-lifted-off-jordan-s-armed-uav-sofex18d2),
and
[Russia](https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)
have reduced America's potential share of the important markets of the
Middle East ([49 percent of the U.S. arms exports between 2013 and
2017](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri))
and Asia. To a certain extent, the people behind the new CAT policy
[believe](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)
that the [strict and [rigid regulatory]{.mark} and procedural
[frameworks]{.mark} that governed the arms exports processes [have
undermined the U.S. competitiveness in the global arms market]{.mark}
and the implementation of the new policy is
[anticipated](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/09/10/state-official-predicts-us-weapon-sales-increase-in-2019/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ebb%209/11/18&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief)
to increase sales. A second trend is the deliberate policy of client
states to diversify their arms purchases.]{.underline} The Arab Sunni
states, for example, have in the last couple of years spent tens of
billions of dollars on
[European](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/saudi-defense-spending-economy-washington-yemen.html)
or
[Russian](https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)
arms rather than on U.S.-made weapon systems. Even a country like Egypt,
which has [received nearly \$80 billion in military and economic
aid](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/09/09/us-to-release-12-billion-in-military-aid-to-egypt/)
over the past 30 years, has tapped from its reserves and loans from Gulf
states and from suppliers in order to
[purchase](http://www.inss.org.il/publication/israel-united-states-military-assistance-egypt/)
at least \$13 billion worth of arms since 2013 from France, Russia, and
Germany rather than from the United States. [The new CAT policy aims to
encourage allies and partners to buy U.S.-made arms,
[including](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/09/10/state-official-predicts-us-weapon-sales-increase-in-2019/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ebb%209/11/18&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief)
by increasing competitiveness by dropping surcharges on products and
lowering the costs of transportation.]{.underline} [A third trend is the
growing demands of client states for more substantial offsets and
localization of production and maintenance, including the transfer of
technology.]{.underline} Thus, for example, under its Vision 2030,
[Saudi
Arabia](https://www.defensenews.com/interviews/2018/08/27/head-of-saudi-arabias-defense-industry-umbrella-org-talks-vision-2030/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EBB%208/28/18&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief)
wants to eventually subject foreign military contracts to a 50 percent
localization rule, based on a partnership model that includes the
sharing of technologies and skills. The Middle East's growing armored
vehicles market, which is
[expected](https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2018/05/02/whats-driving-the-middle-easts-armored-vehicles-market/)
to reach more than \$31 billion by 2021, is an example of a growing
demand for the transfer of technical knowledge which is used to
strengthen an indigenous defense sector that has already begun to export
its own products. Some Western European countries are [more
forthcoming](https://www.defensenews.com/interviews/2018/08/27/head-of-saudi-arabias-defense-industry-umbrella-org-talks-vision-2030/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EBB%208/28/18&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief)
on this issue than the United States. However, [some U.S.
companies](https://www.janes.com/article/76232/raytheon-creates-raytheon-emirates-subsidiary)
have begun forming subsidiaries abroad. Mobilizing the Whole Arms
Exports "Ecosystem" **[In essence, the new CAT policy is designed to
improve the "mechanics" of the administration's arms exports
system]{.underline}**. As
[explained](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)
by Deputy Director for the Regional Security and Arms Transfers Laura
Cressey: In sum, what we're trying to do in this --- in this
whole-of-government effort looking at the arms transfer process really

compete and efficiently deliver the equipment to our partner as quickly
as possible. This effort is promoted by active leadership advocacy,
[including by the president

by senior officials participating in international arms-shows and by
American diplomats around the globe. Additionally, the administration is
actively engaging with the U.S. arms industry, [including it in the

how to improve the arms exports decision processes. [Congress is also
being

by the administration and concerns being raised, especially over
possible human rights violations of client states, are being

of surcharge and transportation costs, a number of additional steps are
being taken in order to increase competitiveness. These include helping
allies and partners to [identify their critical needs and expediting the

While scholars debate the relative effects of arms transfers between
nations and the relationship between arms transfers and interstate
behavior, 3 **[[arms sales are recognized widely as an important
instrument of state power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** States have many
incentives to export arms. These [[incentives include enhancing the
security of allies]{.mark} or partners; [constraining the behavior of
adversaries; using the prospect of arms transfers as leverage]{.mark} on
governments' internal or external behavior; [and creating the economies
of scale]{.mark} necessary to support a domestic arms
industry]{.underline} (see textbox below). 4 **[[U.S. arms exports
sustain parts of the U.S. defense industrial
base]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, foreign sales constitute a
relatively important part of the U.S. economy, constituting 6.2% of the
value of all U.S. exports from 2007 and 2014, compared with a worldwide
average of 0.8% over the same period and 1.9% for Russia (one of the
United States' main competitors in this arena). 5 Direct deployment of
U.S. manpower and resources appears to feature less prominently in
current U.S. public opinion and policy debates regarding future foreign
policy approaches to the Middle East than was the case in the years
following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Therefore, arms
sales in the region may become a significant way for the United States
and other externalactors to influence Middle Eastern partners and
political-military outcomes.6 On the other hand, U.S. reliance on arms
sales as a policy tool places at least some responsibility for their use
in the hands of partners who do not always share U.S. interests, follow
internationally-acceptable rules of engagement, or have the same
capabilities as U.S. forces. [Congress, through its oversight of U.S.
arms sales, plays an important role in shaping U.S. policy in the
region]{.underline}. In past eras when arms sales figured prominently in
U.S. regional or global efforts, congressional actions and opinions in
specific cases arguably had a significant effect on overall policy
trajectories. [[Arms sales are an important contributor to the U.S.
aerospace and defense industry, a sector that directly employs over 1
million workers, with another 3 million working in
support]{.underline}]{.mark}.7 According to one industry observer,
international sales have made up 20 percent of U.S. firms' total sales
in recent years, and industry executives reportedly expect that figure
to grow.8 Middle Eastern states play a critical role in sustaining this
industry. In early 2014, it was reported that, as the U.S. Navy looked
to shift from the F-18 to the new Lockheed Martinproduced F-35, Boeing's
F-18 assembly line in St. Louis, MO, could close within two and a half
years. Similar projections were made for the F-15 production line, which
would come to an end in 2019 after fulfilling a large order from Saudi
Arabia. However, two large deals with other Middle Eastern partners
(Kuwait and Qatar9) appeared to save those lines from closure and extend
their operations into at least 2020. Similar dynamics have played out in
South Carolina (where a potential deal with Bahrain for a number of
F-16s could boost a Lockheed-Martin plant in the state),10 Ohio (where
Saudi orders have sustained General Dynamics tank production in Lima),11
Massachusetts (home to Raytheon, whose production of the Patriot air and
missile defense system was rejuvenated by a 2008 UAE deal),12 and
elsewhere. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Kay

military aid to Egypt, said that when sales are curtailed, "the
companies and the workers that put that equipment together in the United
States are hurt."13 Opponents of specific arms sales sometimes
characterize these potential economic benefits as short-term or
incommensurate with the potential downsides. During a June 2017 debate
over sales of air munitions to Saudi Arabia, Senator Rand Paul
criticized those who would justify the deal as "a jobs program," saying
that "we are going to give money to people who behead you and crucify
you to create jobs. That should never be the way we make a decision
about arms sales in our country."1

#### Any arms export restriction puts US security and international leadership at risk- and importers will just shift to other countries, increasing proliferation concerns

The U.S. Congress exercises an essential oversight function by requiring
the U.S. Department of State to notify America's elected representatives
of all significant military equipment intended for export, but it is now
time for Congress to be informed of all denials of major defense export
requests as well. The current notification requirement allows Congress
to monitor, and at times intervene, on pending arms sales to ensure such
arms exports serves [American interests. These interests include
preventing an arms race, averting the proliferation and risks associated
with weapons of mass destruction (WMD), avoiding human rights abuses,
and encouraging military balances among countries that promote peace and
freedom around the world]{.underline}. This arrangement has served the
United States well during a period when American industry exercised
extensive control over global defense and aerospace markets, preventing
or substantially delaying the proliferation of a wide range of defense
technologies through export restrictions. [Today, however, global market
conditions are considerably different.]{.underline} **[[America's
defense]{.mark} and aerospace [industry is faced with significant
competition, and its dominance]{.mark} in a variety of critical defense
technologies [is under threat. As a result, restrictions on U.S. arms
exports can now accelerate non-U.S. manufacturing, indirectly promoting
advanced defense capabilities to be transferred
abroad.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[In certain ways,
[counter-proliferation policies now encourage
proliferation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [As a Pentagon official in the
Office of the Secretary of Defense, I witnessed multiple cases of the
U.S. government denying foreign partners' requests for American defense
products, only to have those countries acquire the same or similar
capabilities from another source.]{.underline} In a number of instances,
the U.S. government would reverse its denial in time, but by then it was
too late. The sale and opportunity to partner with the foreign
government had been lost, and instead, a market had been opened to
stimulate foreign defense manufacturing. Increasingly[, [when American
industry is forced to abandon]{.mark} these [markets, the gap is filled
by Russian and Chinese companies]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[and their
presence inhibits future American defense industrial
partnerships]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[because of counter-intelligence
concerns.]{.underline}** One export denial creates a cascade of future
denials. Alarmingly, policies aimed at preventing the spread of WMD
delivery systems are now encouraging foreign countries to turn to
Chinese capabilities that do not come with the monitoring requirements
that mitigate the risk of WMD use or loss of control. As the U.S.
Congress evaluates American interests associated with arms exports
moving forward, it ought to also consider measures that will help avert
promoting rival defense manufacturers through export restrictions. There
are times when it is in America's interest to deny defense exports to a
country --- even when that country will respond by purchasing the same
or a similar capability from another foreign supplier. Diplomatic,
strategic, and ethical considerations are reasonable grounds to justify
export denials. **[But there ought to be a transparent, reviewable
record to ensure that the economic and strategic implications of export
denials are taken into account]{.underline}**. [A historical record
would also be a valuable decision-making resource, enabling policymakers
to use past cases and trend analysis to inform future decisions. Every
export denial of major defense equipment should be accompanied by a
written assessment of the economic consequences.]{.underline} The
assessment should gauge the likelihood of an end user receiving the same
or similar capability from an alternative source, as well as the
estimated effect on American jobs. Because exports decrease the per-unit
cost of acquisitions by the U.S. military through economies of scale,
these impact statements ought to assess costs to the U.S. military
department that manages the defense item under review**[. [Maintaining a
healthy U.S. defense industrial base and sustaining American leadership
in emerging technologies will require serious and sustained
consideration of these factors and more.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The U.S.
government is capable of producing these assessments, and the end
product will be better if American industry has an opportunity to share
its own data. Companies have a vested interest in understanding
competitors and market trends to a degree that government officials do
not. In export review decisions, American industry should have an
opportunity to make a case before regulators through mechanisms that
ensure industry input will be a factor, even if not the decisive factor,
in export review decisions. [Institutionalizing such consideration of
the economic and strategic implications of arms export restrictions is a
prudent and practical step that can strengthen America's economy at home
and our military relationships abroad.]{.underline}

#### Arms transfers play a central role in the US aim to maintain a peaceful international security environment 

Andrea **Thompson,** 12-10-20**18**, Thompson is Under Secretary for
Arms Control and International Security at the U.S. State Department,
"US undersecretary of state for arms control: Creating a flexible,
effective foreign policy tool", Defense News, 5-28-2019,

[[**Arms transfers are a central pillar of America's international
security cooperation**,]{.mark} and they are also an important part of
the American economy]{.underline}. [This dual role as a tool of both
foreign policy and economic security --- combined with the unique nature
of the goods and services involved --- makes arms transfer policy
uniquely complex]{.underline}. Recognizing these factors, the U.S.
government oversees and manages our defense trade unlike any other
sector of the export economy. At the heart of this process is the State
Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, supported by the
Department of Defense. The bureau vets each potential sale against
legal, regulatory and policy standards through the rubric of the
president's Conventional Arms Transfer Policy. The new Conventional Arms
Transfer Policy, which President Donald Trump approved in April 2018,
lays out a comprehensive set of considerations that must be taken into
account in reviewing every potential arms transfer. While the policy is
designed as a practical framework for such decisions, it can also be
read as an explanation of the potential benefits of these transfers for
our national security and global security. [Outlook 2019: World leaders
and analysts speak on the state of global security and the defense
industry](https://www.defensenews.com/outlook/) Well-considered **[[arms
transfers can bolster the security of the United States and our allies
and partners.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Examples include defending against
external coercion and providing capabilities in support of shared
security objectives, such as countering terrorism, trafficking and
transnational organized crime. [They can forge and strengthen long-term
relationships and enhance military
interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Arms
transfers]{.underline}]{.mark} [can help maintain the U.S. military's
technological advantages and lower its own procurement
costs]{.underline}, **[[strengthen America's manufacturing and
defense-industrial base,]{.mark} and even facilitate ally and partner
efforts to reduce the risk of military operations causing civilian
harm]{.underline}**. While readers of Defense News may be familiar with
these benefits, it is indisputable that arms transfers also come with
risks. In the past year in particular, many in Congress, the media and
the public have expressed serious concerns about particular sales. I
acknowledge the gravity of these risks and will be as clear with the
reader in these open pages as I am with our partners privately: The
misuse of U.S. defense equipment --- whether illegal retransfers,
illicit exploitation or immoral utilization --- is anathema to this and
to any administration, and is addressed with the utmost seriousness in
every instance by the executive --- and often legislative --- branches
of the U.S. government. In making transfer decisions, and in following
up with our partners after a transfer, [[the departments of State and
Defense work to ensure that U.S. arms transfers are used appropriately
and that they deliver significant foreign policy benefits, contributing
to both regional stability and U.S. national
security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such positive outcomes were very much in
evidence to me when I traveled to Europe and the Middle East this fall.
In Poland, I found a close ally whose location at the eastern edge of
NATO has given it a front row seat to Russia's occupation of Crimea,
Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as its military buildup in
Kaliningrad. In this context, the U.S.-Poland defense trade relationship
mirrors the closeness of our alliance and demonstrates how we work
together to address shared security objectives. For instance, Polish
procurement of the Patriot air and missile defense system will increase
the defensive capabilities of the Polish military to guard against
hostile aggression while also shielding NATO allies who often train and
operate within Poland's borders. Poland's investment in its F-16 fighter
program enhances Poland's ability to provide for its own territorial
defense and support coalition operations. **[In a gesture that is
emblematic of our defense trade relationship, the Polish government has
invited the United States to be the lead nation in the 2019
International Defence Industry Exhibition in Kielce, a role we have
enthusiastically accepted]{.underline}**. [On that same trip, but in a
very different context, I saw how U.S. arms transfers bolster our
relationship with a key partner in the Middle East, the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan.]{.underline} **[Our arms transfers to Jordan assist
the kingdom in performing its instrumental role as a leading partner in
the coalition to degrade and defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,
and contribute to regional stability in ways that often go
unrecognized.]{.underline}** For instance, U.S.-manufactured vehicles
and munitions have assisted Jordan in securing its border with Syria;
U.S. coastal patrol boats have helped enable Jordan to conduct maritime
patrols in the Gulf of Aqaba; Jordan's F-16 fleet has contributed to
U.S.-led coalitions in Libya, Iraq and Syria; and, when tragedy struck
during flash flooding in October, Jordan deployed U.S.-manufactured
helicopters to lead its search, rescue and recovery operations. As
President Trump has often said, "economic security is national
security." As undersecretary of state for arms control and international
security, that is a tenet I continue to observe in action --- from the
American worker on the production line, to the Polish pilot on the
flight line, to the Jordanian rescuer on the harness line. [Through the
framework laid out by the president's Conventional Arms Transfer Policy,
this administration is working every day to ensure that arms transfers
are a flexible and effective tool of U.S. foreign policy, supporting the
capacity of our partners, the growth of our economy and the security of
the American people.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales key to defense companies' bottom line -- direct commercial sales of small arms especially important

**Jeff Daniels 2018** "Defense manufacturers cashing in on Trump's
global arms push." Jan 24 2018
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/trump-as-us-arms-pitchman-.html

[[Foreign arms sales are growing in importance to the top line of big
defense firms]{.underline}]{.mark} and may get an added boost this year
due to initiatives by President Donald Trump. [[Sales to allies and
other friendly countries also have allowed American defense companies to
extend production lines that otherwise might be shuttered or
downsized]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trump's personal involvement in defense
sales also hasn't gone unnoticed, whether touting \$350 billion in
weapons to Saudi Arabia last May or suggesting in November that Japan
should buy more U.S.-made equipment to shoot North Korean missiles "out
of the sky." Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, two defense companies with
upcoming earnings reports, stand to benefit from increased international
sales over the next few years, according to analysts. A lot of the
recent growth in U.S. defense sales is in missile defense systems and
Lockheed's F-35 stealth fighter jets. "We're seeing a global upturn in
defense spending," said Peter Arment, a defense analyst at Robert W.
Baird. "We're seeing Europe, NATO, the Middle East, Asia and U.S.
domestic." [[For defense companies, international weapons sales can
sometimes be more lucrative]{.underline}]{.mark} too. Arment said
[[direct arms sales from U.S. defense companies to foreign countries
"can have a higher margin"]{.underline}]{.mark} than going through
Washington's Foreign Military Sales program. Reuters reported earlier
this month that the administration plans as part of its new "Buy
American" plan to have embassy personnel "help drum up billions of
dollars more in business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry." "This
is the government's job in many ways," Roman Schweizer, a Cowen defense
analyst and former government acquisition official, told CNBC.
Regardless of the administration's new plans, Schweizer said there are
diplomats and other federal workers at embassies around the world
already actively promoting U.S. defense exports. "We have used foreign
military sales to help friends and allies around the world and also to
help U.S. defense manufacturers around the world," Schweizer said.
However, Reuters said the White House's plans will be "going beyond the
limited assistance" now provided by overseas American military attaches
and diplomats. The White House didn't respond to CNBC's request for
comment. Remy Nathan, vice president of international affairs at the
Aerospace Industries Association, said the Arlington, Virginia-based
industry trade group representing some top American defense companies
"is very much in favor of enhancing" the current arrangement.
Specifically, the administration wants to make it easier to export U.S.
defense products abroad, whether drones, aircraft or ships. It comes at
a time when the Chinese are getting more aggressive in selling weapons
overseas. The Trump administration has already relaxed rules allowing
more military sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia, which has been
accused of war crimes by some human rights groups. Also, the
administration lifted human rights conditions for arms sales to other
countries, including Bahrain. In May, when he visited Saudi Arabia on
his first foreign-nation visit, the president announced a massive,
multiyear arms deal with the kingdom that he said would add hundreds of
thousands of U.S. jobs. But some questioned whether all of the weapons
were part of a new agreement. Even so, [[an expanded "Buy American"
program in defense helps the administration in its efforts to boost
manufacturing jobs. The U.S. had nearly \$42 billion in foreign military
sales during fiscal 2017, up from \$33.6 billion in the previous
year]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency. [[There is an expectation that foreign military sales could grow
again this fiscal year due to increased global tensions and efforts by

spending]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Drone sales uniquely protect US national security by securing strategic partnerships and maintaining US influence both in the near and long term

of Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies

https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/,
MJD

Last Thursday, the State Department [announced its updated export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) for
unmanned aerial systems, popularly known as drones. While the White
House
[framed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-arms-transfer-unmanned-aerial-systems-export-reforms/)
the new plan as a means to promote American industry, the guidelines ---
which make it easier for the United States to sell drones to foreign
allies --- will almost certainly enhance U.S. national security. **[[By
exporting drones,]{.mark} which are on the wish lists of militaries
around the world, [Washington can strengthen ties with allies, enhance
burden-sharing and interoperability]{.mark} during coalition operations,
[and prevent strategic competitors]{.mark} like China [from gaining
influence among Washington's security partners]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The new guidelines streamline the sale of both armed and unarmed drones,
while still maintaining stipulations that ensure recipients use exported
drones in accordance with international law and international human
rights law. Specifically, the new policy authorizes direct commercial
sales of drone technology, allowing U.S. firms like General Atomics and
Northrop Grumman to directly market certain drones to foreign
governments, rather than relying on the more cumbersome government-run
[Foreign Military
Sales](http://www.dsca.mil/programs/foreign-military-sales-fms) program.
The policy also [eliminates the special scrutiny on laser
designators](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) ---
technology that allows drones to cue airstrikes. Under earlier policies,
these factors often halted drone transfers or extended U.S. government
deliberations on export approval. U.S. drone exports have long been
governed by both domestic export controls and international agreements.
These regulations, like the multilateral [Missile Technology Control
Regime](http://mtcr.info/), were drafted long before unmanned and
remotely piloted aircraft became common features of military arsenals.
As such, these regulations often characterized long-range drones as
cruise missiles. Because cruise missiles were capable of delivering
nuclear or chemical weapons, there was a "strong presumption of denial"
for drone exports. The Obama administration [initially
followed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/a-new-u-s-policy-makes-it-somewhat-easier-to-export-drones/?utm_term=.63eb6b5b2bcc)
these guidelines because they believed more American exports could lead
other powers to sell drones to states that might use them in ways that
violated international law. When it became clear that states like China
and Israel were more than willing to export drones despite U.S.
restraint, the administration released a [drone export
policy](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/02/237541.htm) in
2015 that attempted to advance its national security interests and
slightly ease restrictions on drone exports. The 2015 policy established
a drone-specific framework to govern foreign transfers, but still
required all exports to go through slow government approval processes.
Under past policies, even close U.S. allies faced difficulties acquiring
U.S. drones.
[Italy](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-to-arm-its-reapers/),
for instance, was unable to arm its U.S.-produced Reapers between 2011
and 2015.
[Jordan](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/232045-republican-pushes-drones-for-jordan)
was barred from receiving unarmed variants of Predator drone that it
hoped to use during counter-ISIL operations. **[Without access to
U.S.-produced drones, states had two options: either give up drone
acquisition efforts or seek out new suppliers.]{.underline}**
[Abandoning drone procurement was impractical since states buy these
military technologies to [meet specific military requirements or to
signal technical and military
prowess](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/droning-on-explaining-the-proliferation-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/8982612535696D00F6D040DB56C741AF)to
domestic and international audiences. As a result, states --- including
close U.S. allies --- were forced to find suppliers who were more
willing to hawk their wares. [Saudi Arabia and
Jordan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unable-to-buy-u-s-military-drones-allies-place-orders-with-china-1500301716),
for instance, turned to China to build drone fleets filled with Predator
knock-offs, and
[India](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/India-to-receive-armed-Heron-drones-from-Israel-486016)
invested \$400 million on Israeli drones]{.underline}. **[[When allies
turn to other states for advanced military technology, U.S. national
security suffers]{.mark} in three critical ways.]{.underline}**
**[[First, withholding military technology from close allies and
partners can strain security relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Since these partnerships are grounded in trust, shared interests, and
common threats, partners may equate a state's unwillingness to export
drones with waning loyalty and commitment to other security
agreements.]{.underline} For instance, the former top Italian Air Force
general questioned Washington's initial denial of Italy's request for
armed drones,
[arguing](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-to-arm-its-reapers/)
that "it seemed impossible that a loyal ally could be ruled out" from
receiving armed drones. He noted that "in Afghanistan, we would have
saved Italian lives if we had had armed drones." [By streamlining the
process for foreign states to acquire U.S. drones, the new policy helps
reduce this sort of tension that can engender mistrust and muddy
interactions between Washington and its partners**. [Second, denying
exports can degrade effectiveness and interoperability during coalition
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By not exporting weapons to allies,
supplier states potentially limit the ability of allies to share
operational burdens. For instance, export controls and international
agreements that blocked the transfer of armed drones to many NATO allies
left Washington responsible for operating the bulk of armed drones in
Afghanistan. This demand placed additional strain on the already
[under-manned](https://www.stripes.com/news/unmanned-now-undermanned-air-force-struggles-to-fill-pilot-slots-for-drones-1.236906)
and
[overstretched](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/forever-deployed-combat-dwell-reform-mq-9-crews-beyond-overdue/)
American capacity. Additionally, **[if states turn to alternate
suppliers, their ability to easily
[operate](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_84112.htm) with
American forces may be reduced.]{.underline}** [Common systems and
similar technical infrastructure helps streamline information sharing,
planning, maintenance, and operations]{.underline}. Given the frequency
of coalition operations in the current security environment,
interoperability is key to increasing operational effectiveness and
reducing the likelihood of mishaps and confusion during future crises
and contingencies. **[[Third]{.mark}, and perhaps most strategically
important, [Washington loses political and military influence]{.mark}
when states turn to other suppliers.]{.underline}** [When a state
transfers arms, it hopes to establish influence in the recipient state
throughout and beyond the lifecycle of the weapon system]{.underline}.
**[In the short term, [influence is established via agreements to train
personnel or maintain equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
Producer states design training curricula and can withhold future
deliveries, parts, or maintenance if a recipient takes actions that run
counter to their interests. [**[Over time, these relationships often
deepen into wider security partnerships]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [For
instance, personnel who operate U.S.-produced equipment frequently
attend training or exercises in the United States. There, they gain
exposure to U.S. military principles, culture, and values. Because of
these experiences, these personnel may be selected for professional
military education programs like the U.S. Air Force's [Air War
College](http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/IOS/) later in their careers.
[These relationships can strengthen bonds between personnel from the
United States and states that receive U.S.-built equipment, ensuring
long-term American influence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[The new
policy makes it easier for the United States to provide drones to

While the export of U.S.-produced drones enhances national security,
what effect will increased drone sales have on international security?
[Drone proliferation pessimists often lament that weakening drone export
controls will [make it
easier](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/the-moral-hazard-of-drones/)
for states to launch military operations and destabilize security by
triggering arms racing between states eager to one-up their rival's
drone capabilities.]{.underline} [These concerns are likely overstated
for two reasons.]{.underline} **[First, [the transfer of drones is
unlikely to be inherently destabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
To be sure, the reduced risk associated with operating remotely piloted
aircraft may lead risk-averse decision-makers to more frequently launch
drones on intelligence gathering and strike missions. However, [limited
transfers of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability.]{.underline} For instance,
[Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/international/china-drone-export-iraq.html)
and
[Nigeria](https://www.popsci.com/watch-nigerias-first-confirmed-drone-strike)
have used recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on
suspected terrorists, but these operations have been limited in scale
and geographic scope. [Carrying out worldwide drone operations like
those conducted by the United States requires a massive [technological
and logistical
infrastructure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2016.1134189?journalCode=fsst20),]{.underline}
and as I describe in a [forthcoming book

a complex backbone of intelligence personnel and organizations that
costs billions and takes decades to develop. [Even if countries acquire
drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the required network of bases,
satellites, computer systems, and personnel before a state can conduct
sustained, large-scale drone operations]{.underline}. Second, **[even if
the sale of drones under the new policy triggers drone arms racing,
[remotely piloted aircraft often have a stabilizing effect on crisis
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} As I have [argued
elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/23/so-china-seized-a-u-s-drone-submarine-welcome-to-the-future-of-international-conflict/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8e399e3db50#comments),

crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by collecting intelligence that can make
subsequent operations more precise or limited]{.mark}, or can be
deployed in lieu of more escalatory means, like ground forces or manned
aircraft]{.underline}. While states may be more prone to launch drones
on risky missions, [states are unlikely to take escalatory military or
diplomatic responses after a drone is lost to enemy action]{.underline}.
In other words, drones provide a de-escalatory off-ramp that typically
is not an option when inhabited assets are involved. For instance, the
Pentagon largely ignored Syria's [downing of a remotely piloted Predator
reconnaissance
drone](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2015/06/29/air-force-lost-predator-was-shot-down-in-syria/)
in 2015. In contrast, Syria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel
Air Force F-16 fighter in February triggered a massive Israeli
retaliation that reportedly
[destroyed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/israel-took-out-half-of-syria-s-air-defenses-military-beliefs-1.5808981)
half of Syrian air defenses. As drones become an increasingly common
fixture on the modern battlefield, the new export policy marks an
important step in managing their proliferation and promoting
Washington's national security interests. **[[Streamlining the drone

partners, enhances interoperability during coalition operations, and

just [called for
changes](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/04/white-house-relaxing-drone-exports-heres-good-next-step/147611/)
to the Missile Technology Control Regime that would reclassify drones
like the Reaper and ease their export. Until then, China and other drone
producer states may attempt to woo customers by undercutting U.S.
prices. Or, they might impose fewer political conditions to sales,
allowing exports to states with shadier human rights records. [Even if
some clients have already purchased drones from other suppliers, the new
policy ensures that Washington is at least in the game as a viable
alternative as states continue to expand their drone
fleets]{.underline}.

#### US drone industry is still at a disadvantage, despite recent policy changes

WASHINGTON ― The [Trump administration has rolled out a new set of
policies governing its [exports of military equipment
abroad](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/04/17/trumps-new-drone-defense-export-rules-expected-this-week/),]{.underline}
with a focus on the idea that "[economic security is national
security](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2017/12/18/trumps-national-security-strategy-unveiled-with-focus-on-economics/)."
**[But [the changes]{.mark} may [fall short of what the defense industry
was hoping for, particularly when it comes to the [export of military
drones](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/08/03/trump-administration-launches-review-of-drone-export-regulations/).]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The new rules, rolled out April 19, create broad new language
emphasizing the need to consider economic benefits when looking at
potential weapon exports to partner nations. [Peter Navarro, White House
National Trade Council head, said this change will allow allies and
partners "to more easily obtain" American security goods, which in turn
improves the security of the Untied States while "reducing" the need for
them to buy Chinese and Russian systems.]{.underline} "For too long we
have hamstrung ourselves and limited our ability to provide our allies
and partners with the defensive capabilities they require, even when in
the U.S. interests," Navarro said. Tina Kaidanow, principal deputy
assistant secretary for political-military affairs, said the change
represents "efforts to do things a little bit more strategically. We
need to do, the U.S. government, a better job of strategic advocacy for
some of our companies. We need to think about those areas where we can
really enable sales oversea." Talking to reporters ahead of the
announcement, both noted that there will now be a 60-day period for
feedback from industry, which will help shape potential changes in the
future. However, [the two offered few hard details about what would
change for conventional arms transfers, and Navarro declined to say what
economic impact could potentially be in terms of jobs or dollar
figures]{.underline}. But [industry is excited about the possible
impact. "This is a really big deal. These are issues that had typically
been relegated to the second tier,"]{.underline} said Remy Nathan, vice
president of the Aerospace Industries Association. "Credit this
administration, credit \[Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\] for putting
partnerships in his top three priorities." The U.S. defense industry
continues to dominate on a global scale. [According to numbers from the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, American accounted for
34 percent of total arms exports from 2013--17, with 98 countries buying
American goods]{.underline}. The second largest exporter in the world,
Russia, accounted for 22 percent of weapon exports during that same
period, with 47 countries as clients; China, the fifth-ranked exporter,
represented only 5.7 percent of global exports, with 48 countries. And
while it is an imperfect measurement, the State Department cleared
\$75.9 billion in potential arms sales in fiscal year 2017, [setting a
new
record](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/09/13/us-clears-record-total-for-arms-sales-in-fy17/).
So far in FY18, State has ok'd over \$55 billion in potential future
sales. Drone changes **[But [where the U.S. is seeing a steep rise in
competition is in the unmanned vehicle sector, particularly from
China]{.mark}, who has made inroads into the traditionally U.S.
dominated Middle East with their cheaper UAVs.]{.underline}** With
today's announcement, the U.S. has made two tweaks to how it handles
drone exports. The first is opening up the opportunity for companies to
sell systems via Direct Commercial Sales process, under which a company
and another nation can directly negotiate, rather than requiring a more
formal Foreign Military Sales process, where the U.S. government acts as
a go-between. DCS sales are seen as faster than FMS sales. Secondly, the
government is eliminating rules that marked unarmed systems with
laser-designator technology as "strike enabling," which put them in the
same category as armed drones, and hence received higher scrutiny.
Kaidanow said the goal was to make sure "U.S. industry faces fewer
barriers and less confusion when they are attempting to compete against
other countries and marketing and selling those similar systems to our
partners. " A new policy could make it easier to sell \"strike-enabled\"
unmanned systems abroad. (Airman 1st Class Emily A. Kenney/U.S. Air
Force) [[While]{.mark} those [changes will be welcomed by the UAV
industry, it falls short of what was]{.mark} expected and [hoped for by
major producers of military drones.]{.mark}]{.underline} [It had been
expected that the new policy would reinterpret the "strong presumption
of denial" clause in the [Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/12/19/heres-how-the-trump-administration-could-make-it-easier-to-sell-military-drones/),
an international arms control agreement among 35 nations that governs
the export of missiles and drones, a second source
explained.]{.underline} The current clause makes it difficult to approve
the sale of category-1 drones capable of carrying 500-kilogram payloads
for more than 300 kilometers. The Obama administration had set a
standard of how it interprets the MTCR language that some in industry
have complained is too strict, and had expected to see changed with this
policy a "presumption of approval" for a specific set of allies and
partners in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.
However, changes to the MTCR remain on the table for the long term, with
Kaidanow saying: "We are looking to ensure that the MTCR keeps pace with
the dynamic quality." While she did not explain what changes to the MTCR
may come, American officials in October floated a whitepaper to allies
proposing that any air vehicle that flies under 650 kilometers per hour
would drop to "category-2" and thus be subject to approval on a
case-by-case basis, as opposed to having to follow the more strict
"category-1" policies. Despite fears from nongovernmental organizations
that human rights concerns would be weakened under the new policy, both
Navarro and Kaidanow pushed back at the idea human rights were being
weakened under the new policy, with Kaidanow saying "nothing" had
changed from that regard. Navarro added that the policy continues to
"require enhanced end use monitoring, directing the federal government
to work with partners to reduce civilian casualties in conflict and
championing principals of human rights in international law, including
the law of armed conflict."

#### Arms sales to India help secure our strategic partnership

India", U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, 5-28-2019,

MJD

A decade ago, U.S. arms sales to India amounted to virtually nothing.
[Today, [the United States is the second-largest arms supplier to
India]{.mark}]{.underline}, and U.S. officials say they hope to increase
that business. [Army Lt. Gen. Charles
Hooper](http://www.dsca.mil/about-us/lieutenant-general-charles-hooper),
the director of the [Defense Security Cooperation
Agency](http://www.dsca.mil/about-us/lieutenant-general-charles-hooper),
spoke to reporters while traveling to India with [Defense Secretary
James N.
Mattis](https://dod.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/1055835/james-mattis/).
His agency is responsible for foreign military sales. India is
modernizing its military and the United States would like to compete for
those sales, he said. "There are four values that govern our
relationship with India, and our relationship with all our partners: ...
transparency, responsiveness, integrity and commitment," the general
said. Transparency means the agency shares all the information about
systems and associated costs with its partners. This allows other
nations to make informed decisions on the types of capabilities they
need. 'We're Very Confident ... They'll Choose American Systems' "We're
very confident that, when given all of the information that they need,
they'll choose American systems and American services," Hooper said.
Responsiveness is another key. The general stays in constant touch with
his partners. In India's case that is the director general for
acquisition. "Every time I see him, I provide him with a spreadsheet
that updates ... the status of all of our systems," Hooper said. "And
[[we have discussions on how we can better strengthen the
partnership]{.mark}." Integrity is a key value that separates the U.S.
approach to security cooperation from others]{.underline}, he said.
"Integrity means, quite simply, our books are always open," Hooper said.
"We don\'t charge one penny more than we have to for the finest systems
and the finest services in the world. The books are always open, and we
can account for every penny that our partners spend." [[The U.S. is
committed to providing goods and services at the point of sale, and to
forging and strengthening a long-term relationship]{.underline}]{.mark},
the general said. "We found that when we follow those four values with
our Indian partners, it helps to support, to strengthen that
relationship," he said. Hooper cannot comment on possible sales to
India, but he said he believes that no matter the domain, any U.S.
system would bring enormous capabilities and be economically
competitive. "What I can say is, I expect some very fruitful
discussions," he said. "All of our systems are the best in the world,
and I\'m sure are very competitive to suit and meet the requirements of
our Indian partners." India has already bought U.S. [C-17 Globemaster
III](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1529726/c-17-globemaster-iii/)
aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. [**[One aspect of the
current U.S.-Indian talks is the communications compatibility and
security agreement. Once signed, a much larger range of U.S. weapons
systems would be available to India]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Over the
years, first the Soviet Union and then Russia were the largest arms
suppliers to India. Russia remains the biggest supplier, mainly because
of contracts for legacy systems.]{.underline} "We\'re confident that
when our partners take a look at the capabilities that we\'re offering
as opposed to whatever capabilities they previously been committed to,
that ... U.S. capabilities will stand head-and-shoulders above all of
them and will become the selection of choice, and we will become their
partner of choice," Hooper said.

#### US- Indian relations are critical to the entire security strategy in the Indo-Pacific region- specifically in countering China- continued arms sales are the lynchpin to that relationship

**[[Washington sees India as the linchpin of its new Indo-Pacific
strategy to counter the rise of China,]{.mark} but has spent months
pushing for closer co-operation]{.underline}**. It wants Delhi to
participate in more joint military exercises, boost its role in regional
maritime security and increase arms purchases. "We fully support India's
rise," said Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, during a visit to New
Delhi. Later on Thursday the two countries signed Comcasa, a security
agreement tailored to India that Jim Mattis, US defence secretary, said
meant the pair could now share "sensitive technology". Nirmala
Sitharaman, India's defence minister, said **[[military co-operation had
become the key driver of US-Indian relations, which she said was being
taken "to a new level"]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [India also agreed to
hold joint military exercises across land, sea and air with the US next
year.]{.underline} The breakthrough came after talks between Mr Mattis
and Mr Pompeo and their Indian counterparts Ms Sitharaman and Sushma
Swaraj in New Delhi. The signing followed months of concern in India
that it might be forced to concede its sovereignty. US officials were
uncertain that the two would complete the deal. Jeff Smith, south Asia
expert at the Heritage Foundation, said that the deal was a
"significant" step, adding that the US and India had previously been
forced to communicate on open radio channels and remove some encrypted
systems from platforms the US had already sold to India. He added that
US officials had spent months attempting to convince Delhi that such
agreements facilitated sensible and often mundane co-operation --- such
as being able to refuel each other's ships at sea --- rather than
Washington spying on India. Lieutenant General Charlie Hooper, director
of the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency that is responsible for
foreign military sales, said the US was discussing selling "many, many
systems" to India. Gen Hooper did not specify the systems under
discussion, but another US official said that India was seeking advanced
drones, helicopters and fighter jets from the US. Delhi has already
bought C-17 transport aircraft, Apache and Chinook helicopters, maritime
patrol aircraft and M777 howitzers from the US. Now Delhi is also
looking at buying the F-16 and F-18 fighter aircraft from Lockheed
Martin to replace its existing Russian models, said the US official.
"The Indian Navy is also considering procuring 24 MH-60R multi-role
anti-submarine warfare helicopters from Lockheed Martin," the official
added. [[Weapons sales from the US to India have risen from negligible
amounts 10 years ago to reach a cumulative total of \$15bn for the past
decade, with billions of dollars of further sales in the
pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark}. But several bumps in the road ahead
remain. US officials want to ensure that India, which buys the largest
part of its weapons from Russia, does not purchase Moscow's S-400 air
missile defence system. Both sides also discussed how far India would
cut its imports of Iranian oil, as well as India possibly playing a
greater role in a nascent "quad" grouping that comprises the US, India,
Japan and Australia.

**[[The U.S. administration's enthusiastic embrace of India as a bookend
of stability in a free and open Indo-Pacific could very well translate
into new defense trade deals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson [highlighted this
potential](https://www.csis.org/events/defining-our-relationship-india-next-century-address-us-secretary-state-rex-tillerson) in
an October 2017 speech, stating the United States has offered India "a
menu of defense options" to improve its capabilities. [If past is
prologue, U.S. firms should be strong contenders to provide several
platforms on India's military modernization wish list.]{.underline}
India has purchased more than \$15 billion in U.S. defense equipment in
the past decade and, with [plans to spend upward of \$150
billion](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2016/01/25/india-plans-procurement-policy-revisions/)
over the next ten to fifteen years, is actively considering American
options. Yet additional major American defense sales to India are far
from assured. While U.S. firms have made remarkable inroads into the
Indian market in the past decade and a half, bilateral defense trade has
nevertheless failed to meet expectations. The United States and India
are still motivated by different objectives, and their respective export
and procurement policies reflect this. While the Indian procurement
process poses challenges to nearly all foreign vendors, American firms
face particularly difficult hurdles due to the unique nature of the U.S.
system. [Existing bureaucratic barriers to trade are not insurmountable,
but overcoming them will require a concerted political and bureaucratic
effort to remedy disconnects between the two countries' policies and
procedures.]{.underline} **[Failure to do so would be a missed
opportunity, as [defense trade can be a particularly effective means of
cementing this strategic partnership]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The United
States is the [leading global exporter of
arms](http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198811800/sipri-9780198811800-chapter-10-div1-51.xml),
while India is the leading arms importer. Befitting their exceptional
standings, the two countries have designed their own singularly complex
systems of regulations and processes for arms sales and procurement. And
those systems are in tension with one another because the defense trade
objectives of the two countries---while similar---are not perfectly
aligned. [[The United States uses arms sales to enable [closer
partnerships and
interoperability](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2017/272870.htm)
with its friends and allies. The overarching objective of U.S. arms
exports is to build partners' and allies' capacity to defend themselves
and]{.mark}---when appropriate---[to facilitate their ability to operate
alongside the U.S. military to address shared security
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[The United States also leverages
arms exports to maintain the U.S. industrial base]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[and---through economies of scale---reduce costs to the U.S.
armed forces.]{.underline}** Washington takes into account several
[additional considerations for defense
exports](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2017/272870.htm)---particularly
that such exports preserve the United States' technological edge and
support broader foreign policy objectives, such as human rights and
regional stability---any one of which can trump interoperability and
partnership goals. Indeed, this happened twenty years ago when
Washington blocked arms sales to New Delhi following the latter's 1998
nuclear test. India, which has long endeavored to achieve
self-sufficiency in manufacturing defense equipment, has developed an
acquisitions process designed to transfer foreign technology and
production lines to Indian soil with the twin goals of facilitating an
indigenous defense industry and promoting job growth (the latter
objective being consistent with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in
India initiative). It has also sought to root out opportunities for
corruption by issuing detailed, prescriptive procedures. The aim of the
[2016 Defense Procurement
Procedure](https://mod.gov.in/dod/sites/default/files/dppm.pdf_0.pdf)
(DPP)---the guidance document for all Indian defense acquisitions---is
to enable India's armed forces to acquire needed capabilities in a
timely manner that fosters self-reliance, is transparent and
accountable, and guarantees fair competition. To create a level playing
field, the DPP prioritizes multivendor competitions over sole-source
procurements as a way to minimize corruption and get more favorable
pricing. India's pursuit of self-reliance is also reflected in its
defense offsets policy, which requires foreign vendors of high-cost
contracts (approximately \$300 million or greater) to invest 30 percent
of the cost of the contract back in the Indian defense or aerospace
sector. [Washington and New Delhi have taken some constructive steps in
recent years to make the defense acquisitions process
easier.]{.underline} India has raised its [caps on foreign direct
investment](https://www.export.gov/article?id=India-Defense) in domestic
defense firms (from 26 percent to 49 percent ownership stakes), which
makes it easier for foreign firms to enter into joint ventures with
Indian companies. New Delhi also made slight modifications to its
defense offsets policy to induce foreign investment in the defense
sector, allowing offset requirements to be met through investment in the
civilian aerospace sector in addition to the defense sector, to
compensate for the latter's limited absorptive capacity. Meanwhile, the
United States formally changed its export policy for India beginning in
2001, when then president George W. Bush's administration lifted
sanctions based on the determination that it was in the United States'
interest to facilitate the rise of a strong India. In the intervening
years, Washington made several additional adjustments to export control
policies to facilitate arms sales to New Delhi. Significantly, it
transitioned from a presumption of denial posture---a policy that
effectively blocked exports of sensitive military or dual use
technologies to India without significant justification---to a [general
policy of
approval](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/html/2017-00439.htm)
for exports of most military technologies to India (provided they are
not to be used in nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological weapons
programs). The United States' 2016 designation of India as a major
defense partner, a classification unique to [New Delhi, is indicative of
India's elevated status in U.S. export considerations. As a result of
these efforts, American firms have successfully sold [several high-end
platforms](http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/184781/us-approves-sale-of-22-guardian-drones-to-india%3A-reports.html)
to India since 2008,]{.underline} including P-8 maritime patrol
aircraft, C-130 and C-17 transport aircraft, M777 howitzers, and Apache
and Chinook helicopters. [**[The United States and India are on the cusp
of translating a shared vision for the Indo-Pacific into tangible
cooperation---with defense trade serving as an important
catalyst]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [India's military modernization plan
could potentially drive closer engagement with the United States through
combined training on shared platforms and future joint ventures between
U.S. and Indian defense firms.]{.underline} The promise of cooperation
spurred by defense trade is challenged by the two countries' different
procedural approaches and compounded by complacency within their
respective bureaucracies that past successes will lead to future sales.
Still, the United States and India do not have to change their
overarching objectives with regard to defense trade. They must, however,
make procedural changes to their respective policies to ensure bilateral
defense trade and technology cooperation proceed apace. To do so will
require political level attention in both capitals to override the
inevitable bureaucratic resistance and inertia.

#### US defense industry depends heavily on Saudi Arabian purchases- and is expecting continued sales for future growth

Major U.S. defense manufacturers say they will stand by the Trump
administration regarding whether American-made weapons systems should be
sold to the Saudi government, despite a global political backlash over
the killing of a Saudi journalist and an ongoing humanitarian crisis at
the hands of a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. U.S. defense
contractors have shied away from publicly discussing the disappearance
and killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist
who [sharply
criticized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/jamal-khashoggi-what-the-arab-world-needs-most-is-free-expression/2018/10/17/adfc8c44-d21d-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?utm_term=.fff36a93460d)
the Saudi state for limiting free expression. But when pressed by
investment analysts this week on how the political situation might
affect their business, executives from Massachusetts-based Raytheon and
Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin said they would keep selling advanced
weaponry to Saudi Arabia as long as the U.S.-Saudi military partnership
continues. "We continue to be aligned with the administration's
policies, and we intend to honor our commitments," Toby O'Brien,
Raytheon's chief financial officer, told investors Thursday. Both
companies emphasized that their international arms deals are ultimately
coordinated by the government in concert with foreign allies. For U.S.
defense contractors to sell weapons systems abroad, they have to first
go through a complicated government process that involves the Defense
Department, State Department and Congress, which vet each deal's
geopolitical, security and human rights implications. "Most of these
agreements that we have are government-to-government purchases, so
anything that we do has to follow strictly the regulations of the U.S.
government," Lockheed Martin chief executive Marillyn Hewson said
Tuesday. "Beyond that, we'll just work with the U.S. government as
they're continuing their relationship with Saudi." The Aerospace
Industries Association, a trade group, said it will continue to "support
U.S. national security and foreign policy goals, and our companies will
continue to look to the government for direction on how best to support
those goals." [[Saudi Arabia is a favored business partner of U.S.
defense contractors because it is among the world's largest military
spenders]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[The kingdom [spends billions of
dollars every year on American-made weapons systems]{.mark}, and it has
few of the bureaucratic checks and balances that delay big military
purchases in the United States.]{.underline}** [Raytheon executives said
Thursday that about 5 percent of the company's annual sales come from
the kingdom, though they emphasized it is not dependent on any one
foreign buyer.]{.underline} They expect those sales to remain roughly
flat into next year, as the company receives at least two large
contracts for "offensive and defensive weapons systems" and military
training. [Lockheed executives said Tuesday that they have "about less
than \$500 million" in Saudi sales planned for 2019 and about \$900
million into 2020. The company expects to receive an additional \$450
million contract for combat ships and is awaiting an additional deal on
its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system,
which is expected to be operational in Saudi Arabia by 2023**. [Lockheed
has made selling to foreign governments a key target for
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Earlier this year, Hewson said
her company's [[international sales had jumped from 17 percent of total
sales in 2013 to 30 percent in 2017. Saudi Arabia played a key role in
that growth,]{.mark} she said, and made it clear that the relationship
would continue]{.underline}. "**[[Saudia Arabia has expressed its intent
to procure integrated air and missile defense systems, combat ships,
helicopters, surveillance systems and tactical aircraft in coming
years,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** she said. \[[Inside the Saudi influence

That relationship is now complicated by a global political backlash over
Saudi Arabia's human rights record in the weeks since Khashoggi's
killing, an issue that has also brought renewed visibility to a
long-running humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The United Nations has
counted thousands of civilian deaths, including ["possible war
crimes,"](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23479)
in a Saudi-led war in Yemen that is bolstered by U.S. arms and training.
The Associated Press
[reported](https://www.apnews.com/b6d73ce26807434cba60c880e1c972f1)
Thursday that 21 people, including some children, were killed by a Saudi
airstrike at a fruit and vegetable market near Yemen's Red Sea port of
Hodeida. "Civilians are paying a shocking price because of this
conflict," U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Lise Grande told the
AP. There has so far been little decisive action to curb arms sales,
however. On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the
country would suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia, telling reporters
that, "arms exports can't take place in the current circumstances." And
the European Union passed a resolution Thursday urging a ban on weapons
sales in response to Khashoggi's killing. The resolution was nonbinding,
however, and it was unclear what if any effect it would have. Britain,
Saudi Arabia's second-largest source for military hardware behind the
United States, has yet to take a firm stance on the issue. And President
Trump said on CBS's "60 Minutes" last Sunday that he wants U.S. arms
sales to continue to protect jobs at Lockheed, Boeing and Raytheon. "I
don't want to lose an order like that," he said. \[[In Post interview,
Trump calls Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed a 'strong person' who 'truly

Numerous U.S. politicians have pledged to place limits on Saudi arms
sales in light of Khashoggi's killing even though it will be hard for
them to overcome a White House veto.

[[The U.S.-Saudi strategic relationship is built on a simple premise:
Washington provides physical security for the Saudi state, while Riyadh
serves as a cooperative counterterrorism partner]{.mark} and an
apolitical, responsive supplier to global energy markets.]{.underline}
**[[Arms sales are integral to this relationship: the task of
maintaining the large Saudi military binds Washington and Riyadh
together, while the kingdom's massive purchases of U.S. armaments and
related services strengthen the American defense industry]{.mark} and
general economy.]{.underline}** Traditionally, the relationship was also
based on the expectation that the United States would take the lead on
foreign and security policies to protect Saudi Arabia. Under the Obama
administration, however, this formula was replaced by a partner-based
approach that encouraged the kingdom to develop more forces capable of
providing security on their own. Riyadh subsequently begun to take
unforeseen unilateral action on its self-perceived security interests,
leading to crises such as the brutal war in Yemen, the isolation of
Qatar, the abduction of Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, and the
murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. These developments have
heightened the sentiment within Congress that U.S. security cooperation
with Saudi Arabia should be reviewed---an attitude that will likely grow
stronger after the November 6 midterm elections. The push for such
scrutiny will become particularly urgent if the parties involved in the
Yemen war fail to establish the lasting ceasefire called for by
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last
week. APPRAISING AMERICA'S BIGGEST ARMS CUSTOMER Since May 2017,
President Trump has repeatedly stated that [[the Saudis intend to buy
\$110 billion worth of weapons and associated services from the United
States]{.mark}, a figure that appears to include both currently active
sales and memoranda of intent for future sales]{.underline}. Whatever
the exact figure ultimately proves to be, [**[the scope of Riyadh's
planned purchases is undoubtedly gargantuan.]{.underline}** [In the past
ten years, the kingdom has committed to buy more arms, parts, and
associated training and maintenance services than any other foreign
customer]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} with Congress receiving
notification of \$138.9 billion in potential sales: \$90.09 billion
during the eight-year Obama administration and \$48.81 billion in two
years under President Trump.

ADJUSTING U.S. SALES With U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's
deadliest civilian fatality incidents, Congress has ample rationale to
block, delay, or condition future arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Depending
on the results of this week's election, the Senate's cross-party,
forty-seven-seat opposition to such sales could become a majority. Saudi
intransigence on the Khashoggi case or Yemen peace talks could also flip
more senators into supporting a joint resolution against new weapons
packages. In all likelihood, the [president would veto any such
resolution [unless Congress can show that it has carefully weighed the
costs---in terms of both neglecting the legitimate security needs of a
long-term partner and harming America's status as a security ally and
arms vendor]{.mark}.]{.underline} To address these concerns, the U.S.
government should apply some common-sense guidelines: Think ahead and
review the details of arms sales. [Under the Obama administration's
watch, Saudi Arabia gained far greater military capabilities and was
empowered to act in pursuit of its own security]{.underline}. [The lack
of a detailed, forward-looking, top-to-bottom review of U.S. arms sales
to Riyadh concealed this reality]{.underline}. Prior to considering new
sales, then, Congress should insist that the State Department and
Pentagon provide an in-depth, holistic assessment of the kingdom's
military capabilities, security sector organization, future plans,
related purchase needs, and alternative suppliers, outlining the
implications that these findings hold for U.S. security. **[[Arms sales
should be driven by a clear-eyed, long-term assessment of U.S. strategic
interests]{.mark},]{.underline}** not by simple economic opportunism or
the self-defined priorities of Saudi leaders. Do not deny systems that
are mostly defensive in nature. [**[Some Saudi capabilities represent
welcome burden-sharing with U.S. forces in defending the Persian Gulf
region and containing Iran]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Washington's
desire to hold Saudi leaders accountable for problematic actions is
understandable, but it should not be used to craft policies that reward
Tehran]{.underline}**. [[The United States has a strong strategic
interest in continuing to provide naval systems, missile
defenses]{.mark} (including THAAD[), and support for border defense and
force protection]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., counter-mine and
counter-indirect fire systems[). [These systems represent 54
percent]{.mark} (or \$26.5 billion) of the \$48.81 billion [in Saudi
arms sales]{.mark} proposed by the Trump administration to
date]{.underline}, and a sizable prize for the U.S. economy. Condition
and slow the provision of mostly offensive systems. As described above,
the kingdom could use certain systems to take the war deeper into Yemen,
including M1A2S tanks, self-propelled artillery, and PGMs. Delaying or
conditioning their delivery is therefore justifiable, perhaps with a
proviso that they not be deployed in Yemen unless the Houthis prove
[unwilling to engage in peace
talks](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/u.s.-officials-push-for-yemen-talks).
Washington could also tie sales to a halt in high-risk urban strikes, as
Secretary Pompeo suggested on October 30.

The death of Saudi national and Washington Post opinion writer Jamal
Khashoggi should not result in a change in the U.S.-Saudi alliance.
**[The United States shouldn't even formally inflict a severe punishment
on the Saudi government. Devising a calibrated, proportional response
that preserves the strength of the U.S.-Saudi alliance is both wise and
moral.]{.underline}** After changing its story a few times, the Saudi
government has finally
[admitted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/19/jamal-khashoggi-read-saudi-arabias-statement-confirming-his-death/1701294002/)
that Khashoggi died at the hands of Saudi officials in a Saudi consulate
in Turkey. The Saudis also said 18 individuals, including senior ranking
officials, will be held accountable for what they say was an operation
that was not ordered by the young crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but
went awry and resulted in Khashoggi's death. The media, led by The
Washington Post, has provided significant coverage of the matter. The
picture media reports paint of the Saudis is cruel and sociopathic. The
truth is, Saudi Arabia is often cruel and does not tolerate dissent. The
young crown prince has ordered extrajudicial killings and rounded up and
jailed or killed many of his enemies. Saudi citizens who convert to
faiths outside of Islam are guilty of capital crimes, women are abused
without anywhere near the legal protections of men, and I could go on.
But, despite the Saudi government's lack of some of the principles of
justice Americans hold dear, the Turkish government has provided no
proof to contradict Saudi claims that the death of the Saudi national
was an accident. And the flurry of media reporting has largely been
sourced by anonymous Turkish individuals. [Remember that Turkey, NATO
ally or not, has a dismal human rights record, has jailed hundreds of
journalists, and has a state-run media known for its deceptions and
fabrications]{.underline}. **[Most importantly, [Turkey's president and
Iran ally]{.mark}, Recep Tayyip Erdogen, [would like nothing more than
for the United States to end its alliance with Saudi Arabia,]{.mark}
while gaining favor with the United States for looking like a defender
of a Washington Post columnist.]{.underline}** Contrast this picture of
the Saudi hit squad with the image American media has painted of
Khashoggi, who undoubtedly suffered an unjust fate at the hands of Saudi
officials, as a sort of representative of the free press --- a
"journalist," a "liberal reformer," and "democracy promoter" entitled to
be treated by the U.S. government as if he was an American citizen,
because he lived in the United States and wrote for The Washington Post.
No doubt he was a political enemy of the crown prince, which is why he
fled to the United States last year to live in peace. He [held
beliefs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html)
critical of the Saudi government and supportive of terrorist groups like
the Muslim Brotherhood, and wanted to write in peace about such topics
as the necessity of embracing, rather than cracking down on, Islamists,
and the need for the United States to support the Muslim Brotherhood.
His most recent [article
lauding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/08/28/the-u-s-is-wrong-about-the-muslim-brotherhood-and-the-arab-world-is-suffering-for-it/)
the Muslim Brotherhood was published in The Washington Post in August.
Because of these two extreme characterizations --- "a ghoulish
assassination squad of barbaric Saudis torturing and murdering a
Washington Post journalist who was a champion of free press" ---
emotions are whipped into a frenzy. Congressmen, journalists, and other
media personalities demand justice and feel righteous in their anger,
and their anger is fueling their insistence that the United States take
drastic measures against the Saudi government. [If justice is to be had,
if the moral decision is to be made about how the United States ought to
respond, cooler heads must prevail]{.underline}. Insisting that one must
belong to a school of thought that prioritizes either morality or
realism is a false choice. It is a false choice in the individual lives
of human beings and it's a false choice in matters of foreign policy.
There is no foreign policy action or inaction void of a moral decision
or without moral consequence. None. Every action the United States takes
is based on a complex set of considerations about what is right and
good. So those analysts who argue that we must take a colder, more
transactional, amoral approach to foreign policy are arguing in favor of
actions that have moral consequence, or more likely, are immoral.
Likewise, those banging their fists on the table and shouting "Justice
for Khashoggi!" could be rushing headlong into catastrophe that only
creates greater injustice. **[Consider that [the United States'
strategic partnership with]{.mark} the Kingdom of [Saudi Arabia
has]{.mark} arguably [never been more productive.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The young prince bin Salman has committed to helping the Muslim nation
that contains both Mecca and Medina move towards a more just society and
has already implemented modest but meaningful reforms. Moreover, he has
aided in Saudi's recent softening of its stance towards Israel, stating
that he believes the Jewish people have a "[right to their own
land](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-prince-israel/saudi-crown-prince-says-israelis-have-right-to-their-own-land-idUSKCN1H91SQ)."
None of this should be overstated, and hopefulness for the young prince
to make good on his commitments should be tempered. But [if the prince
can be encouraged to make reforms incrementally and with greater
prudence and consistency, it could portend positive developments not
only for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also for the larger Muslim
world. [Saudi Arabia is famously the largest customer of American
foreign military sales.]{.mark} Unfortunately, this relationship is
frequently disparaged as based on greed and nothing more.]{.underline}
No doubt American companies and therefore plenty of Americans benefit
directly from selling expensive military equipment and weapons to other
nations. But [**[the primary reason that the United States invests so
heavily in Saudi Arabia is because of its strategic
importance.]{.mark}** Saudi Arabia is [a crucial counterweight
to]{.mark} the Islamic Republic of [Iran.]{.mark} Iran is a sworn enemy
of the United States and Israel]{.underline}. [It is responsible for the
deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq, and for maiming
countless other American warfighters in Iraq and
Afghanistan.]{.underline} The Iran regime oppresses its own people and
fails to invest in its own economy, because it has prioritized funding
Bashar al Assad's brutal civil war in Syria, enabling him to repeatedly
use chemical weapons on his own people. Iran is a constant destabilizing
force, seeking to undermine the governments of sovereign nations like
Iraq and Yemen. Although Saudi rightly receives flak for its atrocious
(and in many cases, avoidable) civilian casualties in Yemen, that war
only exists because Iran is funding and arming the Houthi rebels. It is
a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, in which Iran is the
aggressor and Saudi is the defender. Last, and certainly not least, Iran
continues to fund and export terrorism in the Middle East and
[Europe](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/283789.htm). **[It is not
too strong to say [Saudi Arabia is our most important strategic partner
in mitigating and rolling back Iran's power and malign
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While true that the United States is
becoming energy independent, it is still inextricably tied to the global
market and our Asian allies remain reliant on Golf petroleum. The
stability and diversification of the energy market is a critical factor
in matters of war and peace. Iran has repeatedly brandished its ability
to affect the energy market by, for example, threatening to close the
Strait of Hormuz. [**Saudi Arabia leads the Gulf coalition in maritime
security to keep critical shipping lanes open. And [should the United
States and allies like Saudi Arabia lose control of the security
of]{.mark} those [shipping lanes, countries like Iran and its
increasingly bold partners --- large nuclear powers China and Russia ---
would be greatly empowered to more effectively blackmail and coerce the
United States and our allies.]{.mark}** Every government of every
sovereign nation is primarily responsible for the care of its own
people. The United States government must weigh all of the above in
order to determine what is the just thing to do for its own citizens
first, and also what effect its actions will have on its allies, and
even the impact on humanity in general. **Damaging the U.S.-Saudi
alliance will not decrease human suffering, and will not increase
justice or peace and stability for Americans or for our allies. Heavy
sanctions on the Saudi government, [ending arms sales and military
cooperation with Saudi,]{.mark} or demanding the House of Saud remove
bin Salman [would play right into the hands of America's
enemies.]{.mark}** Doing the moral thing does not require the United
States to advantage those who seek to harm us.]{.underline} Instead,
once as many facts can be concluded as possible (which will be quite
difficult if Turkey can't or won't provide evidence that contradicts the
Saudi version of what happened), the United States should publicly
condemn the extrajudicial killing of the Saudi dissident in the Saudi
consulate. This should, ideally, happen at the highest levels. President
Trump or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should make clear that the
United States encourages all nations to make room for political dissent,
to work towards more just judicial proceedings, and to respect the
dignity of its citizens. Perhaps the United States can impose targeted
sanctions against specific Saudi officials if they are found to have
ordered Khashoggi's murder. Then, the United States should be much more
intentional about privately encouraging and supporting reforms inside
Saudi Arabia and the way they fight wars abroad. Partnering with Saudi
Arabia is not "choosing among lesser evils." Partnering with Saudi
Arabia is about doing the most good, and the unjust killing of a Saudi
national does not change that.

Among Donald Trump's many unusual characteristics as president is his
frankness. Last week, after the disappearance and apparent torture and
murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump [[argued that
"we would be punishing
ourselves"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/13/jamal-khashoggi-trump-saudi-arms-deal/1630693002/)
by canceling arms sales to Saudi Arabia over a human rights
concern]{.underline}. Few world leaders, or former U.S. presidents,
would have been so bold as to publicly admit that a Saudi journalist's
life is not worth the loss of arms sales. And [it's true that [the
armaments relationship]{.mark} between these two countries [is
long-established and lucrative for U.S. companies,]{.mark} as [my own
research](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/people.cfm?authorID=571)
on the global defense industry shows.]{.underline} However, [the
president has it wrong when he argues the U.S. would be "foolish" to use
these sales as leverage with the Saudis, claiming they could just get
their tanks and fighter jets from other countries.]{.underline} **[In
fact [it's one of the best bargaining chips he has with the kingdom. An
arms-buying behemoth Saudi Arabia is indeed a major weapons
buyer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Saudi Arabia
spent](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/yb_18_summary_en_0.pdf)
US\$69.4 billion on military expenditures in 2017, according to the
[Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute](https://www.sipri.org/), the world's leading research
organization on conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. Only
the U.S. and China spent more. But since it doesn't have an arms
industry -- like the U.S. and China -- Saudi Arabia must import most of
that from other countries. That's why, over the past decade, [Saudi
Arabia [has
imported](http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php) more
armaments than every country but India. And [U.S. companies]{.mark} such
as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon [have benefited most from all
that spending, making up the [55
percent](http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/values.php) of its
weapons imports from 2008 to 2017]{.mark}]{.underline}. That has made
Saudi Arabia the top buyer of American arms, with 11.8 percent of all
sales over that period. In fact, U.S. defense contractors have made
almost \$90 billion
[selling](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/top-defense-contractors-keeping-quiet-amid-saudi-arabia-uproar-1.552011)
arms to Saudi Arabia since 1950. In recent years, fighter planes like

bargain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-deal.html)
with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump wouldn't lecture his
kingdom on human rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy more American
weapons. Unfortunately, Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in
arms sales has not materialized. Although the Saudis signed numerous
letters of intent and interest, some of which had been
[approved](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/)
by the Obama administration, no new
[contracts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/)
have resulted, due mainly to lower oil prices and the Saudis' costly war
in Yemen. So in the Khashoggi affair, it appears that Trump is eager to
keep to his end of the bargain. He has avoided criticizing the Saudi
government over its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to curry
favor with the monarchy over arms sales. Even in the face of [Turkish
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/europe/turkey-saudi-khashoggi-dismember.html)
that Saudi agents tortured Khashoggi and dismembered his body and [U.S.
intelligence
supporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/middleeast/pompeo-khashoggi-murder.html)
those allegations, Trump has preferred to [blame "rogue
killers"](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657522089/rogue-killers-may-have-murdered-saudi-journalist-trump-suggests)
for any crime. In defending this course of action, Trump
[claimed](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/411271-trump-defends-110-billion-us-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia)
that "if they don't buy \[weapons\] from us, they're going to buy it
from Russia or they're going to buy it from China or they're going to
buy it from other countries." US leverage [While it's true that Russia
and China are [indeed major
exporters](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/yb_18_summary_en_0.pdf)
of armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by
other suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.]{.underline}
First, once a country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons
system, such as planes, tanks or naval vessels, the cost to
[switch](http://doi.org/10.1257/jep.8.4.65) to a different supplier can
be huge. Military personnel must be retrained on new equipment, spare
parts need to be replaced, and operational changes may be necessary.
After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for decades, the
[transition costs](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a498941.pdf)
to buy from another country could be prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi
Arabia. The second problem with Trump's argument is that armaments from
Russia, China or elsewhere are simply [not as sophisticated
as](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1344) U.S.
weapons, which is why they are usually cheaper -- though the quality gap
is quickly decreasing. **[[To maintain its military superiority in the
Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of its
weapons from American and European companies. That is why the U.S. has
significant leverage in this aspect of the
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Any [Saudi
threat](http://fortune.com/2018/10/14/saudis-threaten-retaliation-jamal-khashoggi/)
to retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms sales by buying weapons from
countries that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi
disappearance would not be credible. And is probably why, despite
worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been made. Selling
ideals for short-term gains Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has
developed a global reputation as a [moral
authority](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365846-susan-rice-giving-up-uss-moral-authority-makes-a-mockery-of-america)
championing human rights. Yes, [there have been many times when
realpolitik](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/opinions/trump-trip-abroad-human-rights-tasini-opinion/index.html)
took priority. But despite these moments, the U.S. managed also to
maintain its authority by advocating respect for human rights as a
global norm during the Cold War, and within many repressive regimes ever
since. With Khashoggi, Trump is choosing to give up that mantle
completely by showing his priority is purely economic, regardless of the
impact on the United States' global
[reputation](http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/).
Such a bald-faced strategy, in my view, sells American values short and
weakens U.S. global credibility.

### I/L: DIB key to heg

#### Defense industrial base is key to leadership & deterrence -- prevents multiple wars.

[Continual [warfare in the Middle East, a nuclear Iran]{.mark},
electromagnetic-pulse weapons, emerging pathogens,]{.underline} and
terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction variously threaten the
United States, some [[with catastrophe]{.mark} on a scale we have not
experienced]{.underline} since the Civil War. Nevertheless, these are
phenomena that bloom and fade, and that, with redirection and
augmentation of resources we possess, we are equipped to face, given the
wit and will to do so. [But underlying the surface chaos that dominates
the news cycle [are the **currents that lead to world
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In governance by tweet, these are
insufficiently addressed for being insufficiently immediate. And yet,
more than anything else, [[how we approach the strength of the]{.mark}
American [military, the nuclear calculus, China, and Russia will
determine the security]{.mark}]{.underline}, prosperity, honor, and at
long range even the sovereignty and existence [[of this
country]{.underline}]{.mark}. THE AMERICAN WAY OF WAR [Upon our will to
provide for defense, all else rests]{.underline}. Without it, even the
most brilliant innovations and trenchant strategies will not suffice. In
one form or another, [[the American way of]{.mark} war and of the
[deterrence of war has always been reliance on
surplus]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even as we barely survived the winter of
Valley Forge, we enjoyed immense and forgiving strategic depth, the
3,000-mile barrier of the Atlantic, and the great forests that would
later give birth to the Navy. In the Civil War, the North's burgeoning
industrial and demographic powers meshed with the infancy of America's
technological ascendance to presage superiority in mass industrial ---
and then scientific --- 20th-century warfare. The way we fight is that
we do not stint. [[Subtract the monumental preparations, cripple the
defense industrial base, and we will fail to deter wars that we will
then go on to lose.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Trump = No Heg

#### Trump is transforming heg -- not destroying it

Matthew **Fay**, **18**, 1-4-2018, (Director of Defense and Foreign
Policy Studies) \"Is Trump Abandoning American Global Leadership?\",
https://niskanencenter.org/blog/notes/trump-abandoning-american-global-leadership/,
AVD

As President Donald Trump wraps up his first year in office, [questions
abound about his fitness to serve and what his "America First" foreign
policy portends for America's role in the world.]{.underline} While
several authors kicked off 2018 by arguing that Trump is abdicating
American global leadership, Evan Osnos' essay in the New Yorker argues
that Trump is ceding it to China. Osnos writes, Under the banner of
"America First," President Trump is reducing U.S. commitments abroad.
[On his third day in office, he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a twelve-nation trade deal designed by the United States as
a counterweight to a rising China]{.underline}. To allies in Asia, the
withdrawal damaged America's credibility. "You won't be able to see that
overnight," Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, told me,
at an event in Washington. "It's like when you draw a red line and then
you don't take it seriously. Was there pain? You didn't see it, but I'm
quite sure there's an impact." Benjamin Friedman of Defense
Priorities---a friend and former colleague---is skeptical. Commenting on
Osnos' piece on Twitter, Friedman argues that [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is not abandoning its position as a world leader
because]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline} is yet to
renege on any of Washington's security commitments---instead forsaking
only the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Paris climate agreement. Citing a
2017 War on the Rocks piece he co-authored with political scientist
Joshua Shifrinson, Friedman argues that rather than abandoning American
leadership, Trump is defiling it. I agree with this point in part, but I
think it requires some modification. [The idea that America First
suggested Trump's intent to abandon American leadership has always been
mistaken. [It was always more likely]{.mark} that **[Trump wanted to
transform American leadership]{.mark}** from that of a "chairman of the
board" to something akin to a mob boss. [He doesn't want to
abandon]{.mark} America's security [commitments. He wants to make
them]{.mark} more [transactional]{.mark} (hence his regular calls for
America's allies to "pay their bills" in return for American
protection.). [The distinction is important]{.mark}]{.underline} though.
Trump may not actively seek the end of America's global leadership, but
by transforming it, he may accelerate its demise. [Even a country as
powerful as the United States needs to present a palatable
vision]{.underline} to the world it seeks to lead. The American vision
of global leadership has been built on ideals such as the rule of law,
freedom of expression, open commercial exchange, and positive-sum
cooperation. While the United States certainly violates the ideas at
times, political scientists Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore argue the
resulting hypocrisy is superior to the transactional alternative Trump
presents. They write, \[H\]ypocrisy is as crucial to international
politics as to personal relations. Blunt pursuit of self-interest is
rarely appealing to others. American leaders used to push the
self-serving myth that U.S. interests and the world's interests were
mostly the same, and that America was the one indispensable nation. Now,
Trump has driven a highly visible wedge between American interests and
the world's. Making America Great Again might be an attractive slogan to
a large minority of American voters, but it is unlikely to attract
non-Americans, who fear that Trump wants to make America and himself
great at their expense, something that, in turn, will make greatness
harder to achieve.

#### Trump doesn't hurt US hegemony

**French 17** (David French, 6-2-2017, Despite Leaving the Paris
Agreement, America Still Leads,\" National Review,
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448231/trump-american-global-leadership-paris-withdrawal-wont-change-it)

Our [international leadership rests on facts and common
interests]{.underline}, not adherence to leftist moral norms. Let's make
one thing clear from the outset: [There is no such thing as a "moral
superpower]{.underline}." By that I don't mean that a superpower can't
behave in moral ways, but rather that [morality alone can't make a
nation powerful.]{.underline} Specifically, as the term is used today,
[adherence to leftist norms]{.underline} on climate, immigration, or
social-welfare policy [does not grant meaningful international
authority. In international relations, [power flows through]{.mark}
military and economic [strength]{.mark} combined with the choice to
exert that strength to impose the national will.]{.underline}
[[Leadership is a function of power]{.mark}, and leadership without
power isn't leadership at al]{.underline}l. [Keep those realities in
mind as you read and ponder hyperbolic analyses in the aftermath of
Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris
climate agreement. According to some, this was the moment when America
abdicated its international leadership]{.underline}. This was the moment
when our allies would start to turn their backs on their most powerful
international partner. Consider these comments, in a Washington Post
news analysis of Trump's decision: "[It's going to seriously complicate
any effort President Trump makes to build a counterterrorism coalition
or mobilize the West on any set of policy issues,"]{.underline} said
Bruce Jones, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings
Institution. Or this: "Having pulled out of the Paris accord, after
sowing doubt at NATO and killing the TPP, President [[Trump is]{.mark}
on the way to [ending the U.S]{.mark}.-led international
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the
Eurasia Group, a firm that assesses political risks. "I think we're
heading toward a Hobbesian, each-on-his-own world." [**[No. This is
flat-out wrong]{.mark}.** [The worst impact]{.mark} on international
relations [may be a series of petty]{.mark} or petulant retaliatory
[decisions]{.mark} **[that do precisely nothing]{.mark}** to permanently
either adjust the world balance of power or render America a bystander
in world affairs]{.underline}. [The likely impact is little more than a
series of tweets and public temper tantrums --- much sound and fury,
**[signifying no real change in the international
order]{.mark}.**]{.underline} How do I know this? First, [America has a
long, bipartisan tradition of rejecting international climate pacts
without fundamentally altering its role in the world]{.underline}. We've
seen this movie before. In 1997, President Clinton signed the Kyoto
Protocol, hoping to bind the United States to an agreement to combat
climate change. The Senate responded with the bipartisan Byrd-Hagel
resolution, rejecting the protocol by a whopping 95--0 margin. In 2001,
President Bush announced that the U.S. wouldn't even voluntarily
implement the agreement, breaking with 140 countries that had ratified
the pact. [America retained its international influence. Second, and
more important, decades of national choices have left Trump's political
opponents with no real option other than feeble protest and symbolic
gestures.]{.underline} [**[America]{.mark} is indispensable to the
national security of every single one of its allies. America is arguably
even indispensable to the economy of every single one of its allies.**
So long as America remains in NATO, keeps its treaty obligations
elsewhere, and **[maintains its]{.mark} economic [strength]{.mark}**[,
it]{.mark} is and [will be the leader of the free world]{.mark}, and the
world's dominant global power]{.underline}.

#### Trump is just a speed-bump---long-term foundations of internationalism remain intact.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} many ways, this was an accurate reflection of
the national mood at the end of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
19[[70s]{.underline}]{.mark}. During that decade, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [faced a raft of serious
challenges --- severe economic competition]{.underline} from other
leading powers, [the rise of the Soviet Union]{.underline} as a global
peer competitor in military terms, the [stagflation and]{.underline}
national humiliation caused by the [oil shocks]{.underline}. [[There
were concerns]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[was turning inward]{.mark} in the wake
of Vietnam, as leading congressional observers even sought to withdraw
significant numbers of U.S. troops from Europe]{.underline}. [Economic
nationalism was on the rise]{.underline}. Richard Nixon's first treasury
secretary, John Connally, artfully expressed the ethos: "Foreigners are
out to screw us. Our job is to screw them first." In these
circumstances, [doubts about the staying power of the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the postwar international
system were pervasive]{.underline}. [Defenders of that system fretted
that the American era was coming to a close;]{.underline} enemies of the
free world were often exultant. "The retreat of American power" could
"become a rout," James Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense and
secretary of energy, wrote in 1979. "The trend could well become
irreversible in many respects." "Imperialism is not able to face the
crises," Leonid Brezhnev had told Warsaw Pact leaders the year prior.
[And [**yet** the]{.mark} 19[70s **proved not**]{.mark} to be [the death
knell for American power]{.mark} and the free world system]{.underline}
erected after World War II, [but simply a difficult moment that served
as prelude to renewal]{.underline}. [By the late 1970s, the world was
again turning in America's direction --- democracy was spreading,
globalization was racing ahead, America's primary great-power competitor
was sliding into irreversible decline]{.underline}. And by the early
1980s the United States was pursuing assertive and broadly effective
strategies for re-establishing its global ascendancy and pushing the
positive trends along. Within a decade, the Cold War had ended on
American terms, as democracy and markets were advancing --- with U.S.
assistance --- further than ever before. If focusing on the 1930s
analogy thus leads one to fear that the end of the international order
is nigh, [looking at the 1970s encourages the conclusion that perhaps
the future is relatively bright after all]{.underline}. In this view,
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the
international system it anchors still have tremendous and unmatched
strengths vis-à-vis the competition, the **long-term trends** are
working in Washington's favor]{.underline}, and [[America is]{.mark}
simply [experiencing]{.mark} one of its [**periodic moments** of
doubt]{.mark} and introspection [rather than a]{.mark} more
**[fundamental turn]{.mark}** away [from
internationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} --- just as occurred during the
1970s. So how well does this analogy fit? In some ways, emphasizing the
1970s comparison risks understating the difficulties and challenges
America faces today. For all the disillusion occasioned by Vietnam,
America did not elect a president who repudiated key traditions of U.S.
foreign policy as vehemently and frequently as Donald Trump did during
the 2016 campaign. American "soft power" took a beating amid the
domestic upheaval of the 1970s, but that weakness may ultimately prove
to be minor compared with the loss of prestige the United States is
already suffering as a result of Trump's presidency. From a global
perspective, the Soviet Union may have been an authentic military peer
rival during the 1970s, but even at its peak its sclerotic, command
economy never threatened U.S. economic primacy as China does today. And
in the 1970s, the United States was able deftly to play China and the
Soviet Union against each other; today, Washington has fraught and
deteriorating relations with both powers as they challenge international
norms and geopolitical arrangements to which they were never genuinely
reconciled. The 1970s were a difficult period, no doubt, but the
comparison may --- at least in some ways --- encourage too rosy a view
of what America confronts today. Yet if the 1970s are far from the
perfect analogy, the period does nonetheless illuminate important
aspects of the contemporary moment. It reminds us that, today as in the
past, America's competitors face long-term challenges that make ours
look relatively modest by comparison. Russia is, after all, a declining
economic power and a demographic basket case; its military power thus
rests on extremely precarious foundations. China is already dealing with
slowing economic growth, a rapidly aging population, and a massive debt
bubble, and its sense of geopolitical self-confidence hardly conceals
its leadership's transparent nervousness about growing social unrest and
other signs of dissatisfaction with a corrupt and ruthlessly
authoritarian political system. Similarly, [the 1970s analogy reminds us
to [take into account **long-range**]{.mark} **U.S. [strengths]{.mark}**
that no adversary can match and to factor in emerging trends that may
play to America's advantage.]{.underline} [Washington's]{.underline}
unequaled collection of allies, its relatively healthy demographic
profile, its culture of innovation, and its repeated resilience in the
face of macroeconomic shifts falls into the first category; an energy
revolution that is giving America new [[economic]{.mark} and
geopolitical [leverage is]{.mark} but [one example]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the second[.]{.underline} Moreover, the experience of the 1970s
underscores that assertive challengers often overplay their hand,
thereby risking overreach and exposing vulnerabilities for the United
States and its allies to exploit. An overconfident Moscow took on
numerous Third World commitments during the 1970s, allowing Carter and
then Reagan to punish that overextension through support to
anti-communist guerrillas. Should Russia and China continue their
revisionist behavior today, they are similarly likely to encourage
geopolitical blowback, if only by driving their rivals toward closer
cooperation with one another and with the United States. Additionally,
[we can learn from the 1970s that our current traumas are neither
unprecedented nor particularly severe by historical
standards]{.underline}. [In its effects on U.S. political stability and
American power]{.underline}, the [Vietnam]{.underline} War [was far
worse than anything the country has experienced in Iraq or
Afghanistan]{.underline} over the past 15 years[.]{.underline} Finally,
[the experience of the 1970s also cautions us not to panic about the
state of American internationalism]{.underline}. [Yes, the
[Trump]{.mark} phenomenon [is]{.mark} **deeply [disturbing]{.mark}** for
those who wish to see a globally engaged America contributing
constructively on issues including international trade and combating
climate change]{.underline}. [[But we]{.mark} have [**lived through**
periods of]{.mark} American [disillusion]{.mark} with the world
[before]{.mark}, as the experience of the 1970s reminds us, and the
logic of [global engagement]{.mark} and activism has generally
**[reasserted itself]{.mark}** after a fashion]{.underline} --- [usually
in response to threatening developments abroad. Indeed, the fact that
public opinion polling on support for U.S. alliances and honoring
America's overseas commitments actually looked much worse in the
mid-1970s than it does at present]{.underline} (after the U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, for instance, only 36 percent of Americans felt
that "it was important for the United States to make and keep
commitments to other nations") [provides some antidote to pessimism
today]{.underline}.

### Heg -- Generic

#### Hard power is specifically key to deterrence - 

Alan **Dowd**, senior fellow with the Sagamore Institute Center for
America\'s Purpose, Providence Magazine, December 31, **2015**, "Shield
& Sword: The Case for Military Deterrence",
https://providencemag.com/2015/12/shield-sword-the-case-for-military-deterrence/

Surely, the same principle applies in the realm of nations. [[Our world
teems with violent regimes]{.mark} and vicious men. And something
precious---our notion of peace, sovereignty, liberty, **civilization
itself**---sits exposed to all that danger. In a world where might makes
right, [the **only** thing that keeps the peace,]{.mark}]{.underline}
defends our sovereignty and liberty, [and upholds civilization
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the willingness to use our resources to keep
the dangers at bay. Yet too many policymakers disregard the wisdom of
**[[military deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and too many people of
faith forget that [the aim of deterrence is, by definition, to prevent
wars, not start them.]{.underline} Some people of faith oppose the
threat of military force, let alone the use of military force, because
of Christ's message of peace. This is understandable in the abstract,
but we must keep in mind two truths. First, governments are held to a
different standard than individuals, and hence are expected to do
certain things individuals aren't expected to do---and arguably
shouldn't do certain things individuals should do. For example, a
government that turned the other cheek when attacked would be conquered
by its foes, leaving countless innocents defenseless. A government that
put away the sword---that neglected its defenses---would invite
aggression, thus jeopardizing its people. Second, all uses of force are
not the same. The sheriff who uses force to apprehend a murderer is
decidedly different from the criminal who uses force to commit a murder.
The policemen posted outside a sporting event to deter violence are
decidedly different from those who plot violence. Moral relativism is
anything but a virtue. Some lament the fact that [we live
in]{.underline} such [a violent world,]{.underline} but that's precisely
the point. Because we live in a violent world, governments must take
steps to deter those who can be deterred---and neutralize those who
cannot. In this regard, it pays to recall that Jesus had sterner words
for scholars and scribes than He did for soldiers. In fact, when a
centurion asked Jesus for help, He didn't admonish the military
commander to put down his sword. Instead, He commended him for his
faith.\[i\] "Even in the Gospels," soldier-scholar Ralph Peters reminds
us, "it is assumed that soldiers are, however regrettably,
necessary."\[ii\] They are necessary not only for waging war but,
preferably, for maintaining peace. It's a paradoxical truth that
**[military readiness can keep the peace]{.underline}**. The Romans had
a phrase for it: Si vis pacem, para bellum. "If you wish for peace,
prepare for war." President George Washington put it more genteelly:
"There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to
meet an enemy." Or, in the same way, "We infinitely desire peace,"
President Theodore Roosevelt declared. "And the surest way of obtaining
it is to show that we are not afraid of war." [After the West gambled
civilization's very existence in the 1920s and 1930s on hopes that war
could somehow be outlawed, the men who crafted the blueprint for waging
the Cold War returned to peace through strength]{.underline}. Winston
Churchill proposed "defense through deterrents." President Harry Truman
called NATO "an integrated international force whose object is to
maintain peace through strength...we devoutly pray that our present
course of action will succeed and maintain peace without war."\[iii\]
President Dwight Eisenhower explained, "[Our arms must be mighty, ready
for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to
risk its own destruction]{.underline}." President John Kennedy vowed to
"strengthen our military power to the point where no aggressor will dare
attack." And President Ronald [Reagan steered the Cold War to a peaceful
end by noting, "None of the four wars in my lifetime came about because
we were too strong." Reagan also argued, "Our]{.underline} [military
strength is a prerequisite for peace]{.underline}."\[iv\] Even so, arms
alone aren't enough to deter war. After all, the great powers were armed
to the teeth in 1914. But since they weren't clear about their
intentions and treaty commitments, [[a small crisis]{.mark} on the
fringes of Europe [mushroomed]{.mark} [into]{.mark} a [global
war.]{.mark} Neither is clarity alone enough to deter war]{.underline}.
After all, President Woodrow [Wilson's admonitions to the Kaiser were
clear, but [America lacked the]{.mark} military [strength]{.mark} at the
onset of war [to make]{.mark} those [words matter and]{.mark} thus
[deter German aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In other words, America
was unable to deter. "The purpose of a [deterrence]{.mark} force is to
[create]{.mark} a set of [conditions]{.mark} [that]{.mark} would [cause
an adversary to conclude that the cost]{.mark} of any particular act
against the United States of America or her allies [is far higher
than]{.mark} the potential [benefit]{.mark} of that
ac]{.underline}**t**," explains Gen. Kevin Chilton, former commander of
U.S. Strategic Command. [It is a **"cost-benefit
calculus."**]{.underline}\[v\] [So, given the anemic state of America's
military before 1917, [the Kaiser]{.mark} [calculated]{.mark} that the
[benefits]{.mark} of attacking U.S. ships and trying to lure Mexico into
an alliance [outweighed]{.mark} the costs. That proved to be a grave
miscalculation. In order for the adversary not to miscalculate, a few
factors must hold]{.underline}. First, **[consequences must be
clear]{.underline}**, [which was not the case on the eve of World War I.
Critics of deterrence often cite World War I to argue that arms races
trigger wars]{.underline}. [But if it were that simple, then a) there
wouldn't have been a World War II]{.underline}, since the Allies allowed
their arsenals to atrophy after 1918, [and b) there would have been a
World War III]{.underline}, since Washington and Moscow engaged in an
unprecedented arms race. [The reality is that [**miscalculation lit the
fuse** of World War I]{.mark}.]{.underline} The antidote, as alluded to
above, is strength plus clarity. A second important factor to avoid
miscalculation: [The adversary must be rational, which means it can
grasp and fear consequences.]{.underline} [Fear is an essential
ingredient of deterrence]{.underline}. It pays to recall that deterrence
comes from the Latin dēterreō: "to frighten off."\[vi\] Of course, as
Churchill conceded, "The deterrent does not cover the case of
lunatics."\[vii\] Mass-murderers masquerading as holy men and death-wish
dictators may be immune from deterrence. ([The secondary benefit of the
peace-through-strength model is that it equips those who embrace it with
the capacity to defeat these sorts of enemies rapidly and return to the
status quo ante.)]{.underline} Third, **[[the consequences of]{.mark}
military [confrontation must be credible and
tangible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which was the case during most of the
Cold War. Not only did Washington and Moscow construct vast military
arsenals to deter one another; they were clear about their treaty
commitments and about the consequences of any threat to those
commitments. Recall how Eisenhower answered Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's boast about the Red Army's overwhelming conventional
advantage in Germany: "If you attack us in Germany," the steely American
commander-in-chief fired back, "there will be nothing conventional about
our response."\[viii\] Eisenhower's words were unambiguously clear, and
unlike Wilson, he wielded the military strength to give them
credibility. Discussing military deterrence in the context of
Christianity may seem incongruent to some readers. But for a pair of
reasons it is not. First, deterrence is not just a matter of GDPs and
geopolitics. In fact, scripture often uses the language of deterrence
and preparedness. For example, in the first chapter of Numbers the Lord
directs Moses and Aaron to count "all the men in Israel who are twenty
years old or more and able to serve in the army." This ancient
selective-service system is a form of military readiness. Similarly, I
Chronicles 27 provides detail about the Israelites' massive standing
army: twelve divisions of 24,000 men each. II Chronicles 17 explains the
military preparations made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah, a king highly
revered for his piety, who built forts, maintained armories in
strategically located cities "with large supplies" and fielded an army
of more than a million men "armed for battle." Not surprisingly, "the
fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding
Judah, so that they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat." In the New
Testament, Paul writes in Romans 13 that "Rulers hold no terror for
those who do right, but for those who do wrong...Rulers do not bear the
sword for no reason." Again, this is the language of deterrence. Those
who follow the law within a country and who respect codes of conduct
between countries have nothing to fear. Those who don't have much to
fear. Likewise, to explain the importance of calculating the costs of
following Him, Jesus asks in Luke 14, "What king would go to war against
another king without first sitting down to consider whether his 10,000
soldiers could go up against the 20,000 coming against him? And if he
didn't think he could win, he would send a representative to discuss
terms of peace while his enemy was still a long way off." In a sense,
both kings are wise---one because he recognizes that he's outnumbered;
the other because he makes sure that he's not. Put another way, both
kings subscribe to peace through strength. Again, as with the Centurion
earlier, Jesus could have rebuked the martial character of these kings,
but he did not. This is not just description but commendation. We ignore
their example at our peril. Secondly, it is not incongruent if [we
understand military deterrence as a means to prevent **great-power
war**---the kind that **kills by the millions**]{.underline}, the kind
humanity has not endured for seven decades. We know we will not
experience the biblical notion of peace---of shalom, peace with harmony
and justice---until Christ returns to make all things new. In the
interim, in a broken world, the alternatives to peace through strength
leave much to be desired: peace through hope, peace through violence, or
peace through submission. But these options are inadequate. The sheer
destructiveness and totality of great-power war testify that crossing
our fingers and hoping for peace is not a Christian option. Wishful
thinking, romanticizing reality, is the surest way to invite what
Churchill called "temptations to a trial of strength." Moreover, the
likelihood **[that [the next]{.mark} [great-power war]{.mark} [would
involve multiple nuclear-]{.mark}weapons [states]{.mark} means that [it
could end civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Therefore]{.underline},
[[a posture that **leaves peer adversaries doubting the West's
capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} and resolve---thus [[**inviting
miscalculation**---is]{.mark} not only unsound, but immoral and
[inhumane]{.mark}]{.underline}---unchristian. "Deterrence of war is more
humanitarian than anything," Gen. Park Yong Ok, a longtime South Korean
military official, argues. "**[If we fail to deter war, a tremendous
number of civilians will be killed]{.underline}**."\[ix\] Peace through
violence has been tried throughout history. Pharaoh, Caesar and Genghis
Khan, Lenin, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, all attained a kind of peace by
employing brutal forms of violence. However, this is not the kind of
"peace" under which God's crowning creation can flourish; neither would
the world long tolerate such a scorched-earth "peace." This option, too,
the Christian rejects. Finally, the civilized world could bring about
peace simply by not resisting the enemies of civilization---by not
blunting the Islamic State's blitzkrieg of Iraq; by not defending the
38th Parallel; by not standing up to Beijing's land-grab in the South
China Sea or Moscow's bullying of the Baltics or al-Qaeda's death creed;
by not having armies or, for that matter, police. As Reagan said,
"There's only one guaranteed way you can have peace---and you can have
it in the next second---surrender."\[x\] The world has tried these
alternatives to peace through strength, and the outcomes have been
disastrous. After World War I, Western powers disarmed and convinced
themselves they had waged the war to end all wars. By 1938, as Churchill
concluded after Munich, the Allies had been "reduced...from a position
of security so overwhelming and so unchallengeable that we never cared
to think about it."\[xi\] Like predators in the wilderness, the Axis
powers sensed weakness and attacked. In October 1945---not three months
after the Missouri steamed into Tokyo Bay---Gen. George Marshall decried
the "disintegration not only of the Armed Forces, but apparently...all
conception of world responsibility," warily asking, "Are we already, at
this early date, inviting that same international disrespect that
prevailed before this war?"\[xii\] Stalin answered Marshall's question
by gobbling up half of Europe, blockading Berlin, and arming Kim Il-Sung
in patient preparation for the invasion of South Korea.\[xiii\] The U.S.
military had taken up positions in Korea in 1945, but withdrew all
combat forces in 1949.\[xiv\] Then, in 1950, Secretary of State Dean
Acheson announced that Japan, Alaska and the Philippines fell within
America's "defensive perimeter."\[xv\] Korea didn't. Stalin noticed.
Without a U.S. deterrent in place, Stalin gave Kim a green light to
invade. Washington then reversed course and rushed American forces back
into Korea, and the Korean peninsula plunged into one of the most
ferocious wars in history. The cost of miscalculation in Washington and
Moscow: 38,000 Americans, 103,250 South Korean troops, 316,000 North
Korean troops, 422,000 Chinese troops and 2 million civilian
casualties.\[xvi\] The North Korean tyranny--- now under command of
Kim's grandson---still dreams of conquering South Korea. The difference
between 2015 and 1950 is that tens of thousands of battle-ready U.S. and
ROK troops are stationed on the border. They've been there every day
since 1953. The lesson of history is that waging war is far more costly
than maintaining a military capable of deterring war. As Washington
observed, "Timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent
much greater disbursements to repel it." Just compare military
allocations, as a percentage of GDP, during times of war and times of
peace: In the eight years before entering World War I, the United States
devoted an average of 0.7 percent of GDP to defense; during the war,
U.S. defense spending spiked to 16.1 percent of GDP. In the decade
before entering World War II, the United States spent an average of 1.1
percent of GDP on defense; during the war, the U.S. diverted an average
of 27 percent of GDP to the military annually. During the Cold War,
Washington spent an average of 7 percent of GDP on defense to deter
Moscow; it worked. Yet it seems we have forgotten those hard-learned
lessons. In his book The World America Made, Robert Kagan explains how
"[[America's]{.mark} most important [role has been to **dampen**]{.mark}
**and deter the normal [tendencies of]{.mark} other great powers [to
compete]{.mark}** and jostle with one another [in ways that]{.mark}
historically have [led to war]{.mark}]{.underline}[."
[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [role [has depended on America's **military
might**. "]{.mark}There is no better recipe for **great-power
peace**]{.underline}," Kagan concludes, "[than **certainty about who
holds the upper hand**]{.underline}."\[xvii\]

protracted [worldwide struggle with the [**risk of nuclear

agreed that [[our objective must be to prevent a hostile power to
dominate a "critical region]{.mark}," which would]{.underline} give it
the resources, industrial capabilities and population to **[pose a

policy throughout the post--Cold War era.

[[Giving major powers the green light]{.mark} to establish spheres of
influence [would produce a multipolar world and
**risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} the return of **[[war between]{.mark} the
[major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without a stabilizing U.S.
presence in the Persian Gulf and U.S. relationships with Jordan and the
Gulf States, Iran could shut down oil shipments in its supposed sphere
of influence. A similar scenario in fact played out during the 1987
"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's
nuclear program makes these scenarios even more dangerous.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can
manage the rise]{.mark} and resurgence [of great powers like **China,

on normalizing the geopolitics of the Middle East, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific, which the United States can do by strengthening its
transatlantic and transpacific alliances and adapting them to the new,
dangerous circumstances on the horizon. [The U]{.underline}nited

Although there is a difficulty in defining hegemony, hegemony is
categorized as four groups: structural, behavioural, issue-specific, and
multiissue hegemony8 . Among four hegemonies, the term of structural
hegemony was frequently used to depict the U.S. hegemony9-10. Based on
this structural hegemony, the asymmetrical distribution of resources in
the interstate system produces structural power contributing to the
development of hegemony. [Great Britain and the United States were
historically described as the hegemonic leaderships playing a pivotal
role in global economic interdependence.]{.underline} While Great
Britain was a hegemon from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I, the
United States has been a hegemon since World War II10-11. After the Cold
War, there have been some debates about how sustainable the U.S.
hegemonic power is. Realists have argued that the global system is
viewed as anarchic based on self-help strategies, and major powers will
balance the US power12 . [Unlike realists' argument, the United States
still today plays a hegemonic role in different ways13]{.underline} .
[Hegemonic stability theory argues that it is imperative for one state
to be predominant enough to create and maintain stable international
regimes.]{.underline} The stability of hegemonic system elaborates the
openness of international regimes based on the logic of collective
goods. According to the theory, tremendously unbalanced distribution of
resources in the postwar period provides one state with sufficient power
that helps the state to be capable of supplying the international
economic stability with its own motivation10. However, [what if a
hegemon does not have sufficient motivations?]{.underline} [What is the
consequence of a hegemonic role when there is no motivation or different
motivation]{.underline}? Can economic instability be a possible answer
as an opposite result? If it is this case, what makes a hegemon possess
a different motivation? [The literature on hegemonic stability theory
fails to explain the variety of power dimensions by mainly focusing on
the power with material resources, and the implications of the loss of
the U.S. hegemonic power1]{.underline}4. Given the weakness of hegemonic
stability theory, this paper attempts to look at a different dimension
of the hegemonic power system beyond the typical hegemonic stability
arguments. Different geostrategic circumstances of the U.S. hegemony in
different regions generate a condition for a hegemon to have a diverse
motivation critical to economic performance. The **[paper is designed to
explain how the [U.S. hegemon has an impact on economic performances in
different regions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e. East Asia and the MENA).
East Asia: It was the end of the Pacific War, 1945, when the US model of
laissez-faire was intruded on Northeast Asian countries giving strong
pressures to change their industrial organization model into a liberal
model of nonintervention15 . **[[The economy of East Asia was
significantly influenced by the US]{.mark} aid [and the presence of the
US troops]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By the mid-1980s, [[they became the
major trading partners]{.mark} with the United States and their
multinational corporations played a conspicuous role in international
system16]{.underline}. In an effort of the United States to contain the
Soviet Union and Chinese communism, East Asia has been used as a
battlefield since the Cold War supplying a vital geo-strategic
circumstance for sudden economic development17. The East Asian region
was susceptible for Communist penetration without a strong and rapid
recovery from its devastated economy8 . [Cumings' works illustrate how a
hegemonic system is crucial for the regional political economy in East
Asian countries.]{.underline} Japan's monetary and trade policies were
adjusted to restore trade after American occupation in Japan. In the
postwar**[, [the United States]{.mark} did not only [provide]{.mark}
Taiwan and South Korea with [military and economic aid]{.mark}, but
[also had a profound effect on economic policies]{.mark} in two
countries even by sometimes tolerating import substitution in Taiwan and
South Korea18]{.underline}** . [The predominance of the U.S. hegemonic
power]{.underline}, driven by geostrategic situation such as communist
containment, **[[formed the appropriate environment where trade has been
intensified in the region]{.mark}15]{.underline}**. By linking to the
multilateral international organizations such as the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Bank, and alliances such as The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO[), the U.S. hegemony has attempted to change other countries' own
interests. The hegemonic system strongly maintains when the policies of
a hegemon create benefit recipients in the region.]{.underline} The
groups motivated by those benefits pressure their government to seek for
policies fortifying the hegemonic strategies9 . In the East Asian
region, the U.S. hegemony was willing to foster economic growth in the
region rather than deter it since the region has been a politically
strategic place since the Cold War. In this case, the [logic is that the
stronger the country's economy is, the more benefits the hegemon earns.
Sustained economic growth in East Asian countries could keep American
power against the Communist sides and make strong allies among the
countries in this region. South Korea was weak enough to change their
ideology to communism right after 1953]{.underline}, the end of the
Korean War. When its economy becomes stronger with the help of the U.S.,
it does not find any reason to move toward the Communist country. In the
post-1945 years, the U.S. commitment to supporting free trade shaped the
trading system with multilateral agreements by letting Japan and its
neighbors get involved in the U.S. market. This system also increased
the regional trade relations15 . In conclusion, **[[the U.S. has had
strong economic ties with East Asian countries with the geostrategic
motivation of containing the communism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Heg\-\--Turns Economy

#### US heg structures sustainable and peaceful global economy -- absent U.S. leadership, it collapses

his Ph.D. from Yale University. Ikenberry is the Albert G. Milbank

Hee University. Wohlforth is the Daniel Webster Professor in the
Department of Government at Dartmouth College.

Deep engagement is based on a premise central to realist scholarship
from E.H. Carr to Robert Gilpin[: [economic orders do not]{.mark} just
[emerge spontaneously; they are created and sustained by]{.mark} and for
[powerful states]{.mark}.]{.underline}86 To be sure, [[the]{.mark} sheer
[size of its economy would guarantee the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[a significant role in the politics of the global economy whatever grand
strategy it adopted]{.mark}. Yet the fact that it is the leading
military power and security provider also enables economic
leadership]{.underline}. [The security role figures in the creation,
maintenance, and expansion of the system. In part because other
states]{.underline}---including all but one of the world's largest
economies---[were heavily dependent on U.S. security protection during
the Cold War, the United States was able not only to foster the economic
order but also to prod other states to buy into it and to support plans
for its progressive expansion]{.underline}.87 Today, as the discussion
in the previous section underscores, [[the **security commitments of
deep engagement support the global economic order by reducing**
]{.mark}**the likelihood of [security dilemmas]{.mark}**[, arms racing,
instability, regional conflicts and, in extremis, major power
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} In so doing, [[the strategy helps]{.mark} to
[maintain a stable]{.mark} and comparatively open [world
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}---a long-standing U.S. national interest.
In addition to ensuring the global economy against important sources of
insecurity[, [the extensive]{.mark} set of U.S. [military
commitments]{.mark} and deployments [helps]{.mark} to [protect the
"global economic commons]{.mark}." One key way is [by helping]{.mark} to
[keep sea-lanes]{.mark} and other shipping corridors [free]{.mark}ly
[]{.mark}available for commerce]{.underline}.88 A second key way is by
helping to establish and protect property/sovereignty rights in the
oceans. Although it is not the only global actor relevant to protecting
the global economic commons, the United States has by far the most
important role given its massive naval superiority and the leadership
role it plays in international economic institutions. [**[If the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [were to pull back from the world,
protecting the global economic commons would ]{.mark}**likely
**[be]{.mark} much [harder]{.mark} to accomplish** for a number of
reasons: **[cooperating]{.mark} with other nations on these matters
[would be less likely]{.mark} to occur; [maintaining]{.mark} the
relevant [institutional foundations]{.mark} for promoting this goal
[would be harder;]{.mark} and [preserving access]{.mark} to bases
[throughout the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}---which is needed to
accomplish this mission---**[[would]{.mark} likely [be curtailed]{.mark}
to some degree.]{.underline}** Advocates of retrenchment agree that a
flourishing global economy is an important U.S. interest, but they are
largely silent on the role U.S. grand strategy plays in sustaining it.89
For their part, many scholars of international political economy have
long argued that economic openness might continue even in the absence of
hegemonic leadership.90 Yet this does not address the real question of
interest: Does hegemonic leadership make the continuation of global
economic stability more likely? The voluminous literature contains no
analysis that suggests a negative answer; what scholars instead note is
that the likelihood of overcoming problems of collective action,
relative gains, and incomplete information drops in the absence of
leadership.91 It would thus take a bold if not reckless leader to run a
grand experiment to determine whether the global economy can continue to
expand in the absence of U.S. leadership. [Deep engagement not only
helps to underwrite the global economy in a general sense, but it also
allows the United States to structure it in ways that serve the United
States' narrow economic interests.]{.underline} Carla Norrlof argues
persuasively that [America disproportionately benefits from the current
structure of the global economy, and that its ability to reap these
advantages is directly tied to its position of military preeminence
within the system]{.underline}.92 [One way this occurs is via
"microlevel structuring"]{.underline}---[that is, the United States gets
better economic bargains or increased economic cooperation on some
specific issues than it would if it did not play such a key security
role]{.underline}. As Joseph Nye observes, "Even if the direct use of
force were banned among a group of countries, military force would still
play an important political role. For example, [the American military
role in deterring threats to allies, or of assuring access to a crucial
resource such as oil in the Persian Gulf, means that the provision of
protective force can be used in bargaining situations.]{.underline}
Sometimes the linkage may be direct; more often it is a factor not
mentioned openly but present in the back of statesmen's minds."93
Although Nye is right that such linkage will generally be implicit,
extensive analyses of declassified documents by historians shows that
[the United States directly used its overseas security commitments and
military deployments to convince allies to change their economic
policies to its benefit during the Cold War]{.underline}.94 The United
States' security commitments continue to bolster the pursuit of its
economic interests. Interviews with current and past U.S. administration
officials reveal wide agreement that alliance ties help gain favorable
outcomes on trade and other economic issues. To the question, "Does the
alliance system pay dividends for America in nonsecurity areas, such as
economic relations?," the typical answer in interviews is "an
unequivocal yes."95 [U.S. security commitments sometimes enhance
bargaining leverage over the specific terms of economic agreements and
give other governments more general incentives to enter into agreements
that benefit the United States economically]{.underline}---[two recent
examples being the 2012 Korea--United States Free Trade
Agreement]{.underline} (KORUS FTA) [and the United States--Australia
FTA]{.underline} (which entered into force in 2005).96 [Officials across
administrations of different parties stress that **the desire of Korea
and Australia to tighten their security relationships with the United
States was a core reason why Washington was able to enter into free
trade agreements with them** and to do so on terms favorable to U.S.
economic interests.]{.underline} As one former official indicates, "The
KORUS FTA---and I was involved in the initial planning---was attractive
to Korea in large measure because it would help to underpin the US-ROK
\[South Korea\] alliance at a time of shifting power in the region."97
Korean leaders' interest in maintaining a strong security relationship
with the United States, another former official stressed, made them more
willing to be flexible regarding the terms of the agreement because
"failure would look like a setback to the political and security
relationship. Once we got into negotiations with the ROK, look at how
many times we reneged even after we signed a deal. . . . We asked for
changes in labor and environment clauses, in auto clauses and the
Koreans took it all."[98 [U.S. security leverage]{.mark} is economically
beneficial in a second respect: it can [facilitate]{.mark} "[macrolevel
structuring]{.mark}" of the global economy]{.underline}. [Macrolevel
structuring [is crucial]{.mark} because so much of what the United
States wants from the economic order is simply "more of the
same]{.underline}"---it prefers the structure of the main international
economic institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the
International Monetary Fund; [it prefers the existence of "open
regionalism]{.underline}"99; [it prefers the dollar as the reserve
currency; and so on. U.S. interests are thus well served to the extent
that American allies favor the global economic status quo rather than
revisions that could be harmful to U.S. economic interests.]{.underline}
One reason [they are often inclined to take this approach is because of
their security relationship with the United States]{.underline}. For
example, interviews with U.S. officials stress that alliance ties give
Washington leverage and authority in the current struggle over
multilateral governance institutions in Asia. As one official noted, "On
the economic side, the existence of the security alliance contributes to
an atmosphere of trust that enables the United States and Japan to
present a united front on shared economic goals---such as open markets
and transparency, for example, through APEC \[Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation\]."100 Likewise, [Japan's current interest in the
Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.underline}, the Obama administration's most
important long-term economic initiative in East Asia, [is widely
understood to be shaped less by specific Japanese economic interests
than by the belief of Yoshihiko Noda's administration that it will
strengthen alliance ties with the United States]{.underline}.101 As one
former administration official stressed, this enhanced allied interest
in supporting U.S.- favored economic frameworks as a means of
strengthening security ties with the United States helps to ensure
against any shift to "a Sino-centric/ nontransparent/more mercantilist
economic order in Asia."102 [The United States' security leverage over
its allies matters even if it is not used actively to garner support for
its conception of the global economy and other economic issues. This is
perhaps best illustrated by the status of the dollar as the reserve
currency, which confers major benefits on the United
States]{.underline}.103 For many analysts, the U.S. position as the
leading superpower with worldwide security commitments is an important
reason why the dollar was established as the reserve currency and why it
is likely to retain this status for a long time.104 In the past,
Washington frequently used direct security leverage to get its allies to
support the dollar.105 [There are a number of subtler
mechanisms]{.underline}, however, [through which the current U.S.
geopolitical position serves the same end.]{.underline}
[First,]{.underline} Kathleen McNamara builds on the logic of focal
points to argue that [the U.S. global military role bolsters the
likelihood that the dollar will long continue to be the currency that
actors converge upon as the "'natural' dominant
currency.]{.underline}"106 [Second,]{.underline} Norrlof e[mphasizes the
significance of a mechanism that U.S. officials also stress: the United
States' geopolitical position gives it the ability to constrain certain
forms of Asian regionalism that, if they were to eventuate, could help
to promote movement away from the dollar.]{.underline}107
[Third,]{.underline} Adam Posen emphasizes that [the EU's security
dependence on the United States makes it less likely that the euro
countries will develop a true global military capacity and thus "that
the dollar will continue to benefit from the geopolitical sources of its
global role" in ways that the euro countries will never
match]{.underline}.108 In sum, the United States is a key pillar of the
global economy, but it does not provide this service for free: it also
extracts disproportionate benefits. [Undertaking retrenchment would
place these benefits at risk.]{.underline}

### Heg\-\--Turns Human Rights

#### Heg decreases structural violence globally -- history proves -- it's the best alternative

Globalization, at Crossroads," March 7
http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/8099/the-new-rules-leadership-fatigue-puts-u-s-and-globalization-at-crossroads

It is worth first examining the larger picture: **[We live in a time of
arguably the [greatest structural change in]{.mark} the [global
order]{.mark} yet endured]{.underline}**, **[with this historical
moment\'s most amazing feature being its]{.underline}** relative and
absolute **[[lack of mass violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is
something to consider when Americans contemplate military intervention
in Libya, because [if we do take the step to prevent larger-scale
killing by engaging in some killing of our own, [we will not be adding
to]{.mark} some fantastically imagined global [death count stemming
from]{.mark} the ongoing \"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of [American
\"empire]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\" [We\'ll be engaging
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the same sort of [system-administering activity
that has marked our **stunningly [successful stewardship of global
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} since World War II. Let me be more blunt:
**[[As]{.mark} the [guardian of
globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [**the [U.S. military has
been]{.mark} the [greatest force for peace]{.mark} the [world has ever
known]{.mark}**[. Had America been removed]{.mark} from the global
dynamics that governed the 20th century, the mass murder never would
have ended. Indeed, it\'s entirely conceivable [there]{.mark} would now
[be no]{.mark} identifiable **[human civilization]{.mark} left**, once
nuclear weapons entered the killing equation. But the **[world did not
keep sliding down]{.mark} that path of [perpetual
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Instead, America]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[stepped up and [changed everything by ushering in]{.mark} our
now-[perpetual great-power peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[We
introduced]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the international liberal trade
order known as [globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}** and played loyal
Leviathan over its spread. **[[What resulted was]{.mark} the collapse of
empires, an explosion of [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the
**[persistent spread of [human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the
[liberation of women]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[the [doubling of
life expectancy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a roughly **[10-fold [increase
in]{.mark} adjusted global [GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark} a
profound and persistent [reduction in]{.mark} battle deaths from
state-based [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That is what American
\"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the next time some
TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American military power
as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. [**¶** As for the sheer
\"evil\" that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine
what the world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly
head. **The last great period of global structural change was the first
half of the 20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100
million across two world wars.**]{.underline} That comes to an average
of 2 million deaths a year in a world of approximately 2 billion souls.
Today, with far more comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers
report an average of less than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world
fast approaching 7 billion people. Though admittedly crude**[, these
[calculations suggest]{.mark} a 90 percent absolute drop and a [99
percent]{.mark} relative [drop in deaths due to war]{.mark}. We are
clearly headed for a world order characterized by
multipolarity,]{.underline}** something the American-birthed system was
designed to both encourage and accommodate. **[But given how things
turned out the last time we collectively faced such a fluid structure,
we would do well to keep U.S. power, in all of its forms, deeply
embedded in the geometry to come.¶]{.underline}** To continue the
historical survey, after salvaging Western Europe from its half-century
of civil war, [**the U.S. emerged as the progenitor of a new, far more
just form of globalization \-- one based on actual free trade rather
than colonialism.** America then successfully replicated globalization
further in East Asia over the second half of the 20th century, **setting
the stage for the Pacific Century now unfolding.**]{.underline}

[[The United States possesses the]{.mark} military and economic [means
to act assertively on a global basis]{.mark}, but should it do
so]{.underline}, and if so, how? In short, if the United States conducts
itself in this way, [will the world be safer and more stable, and is
such a role in America's national interest]{.underline}? Here, the
anarchy problem is especially pertinent. The capacity of the United
Nations to act, especially in coping with the most urgent and deadly
problems, is severely limited, and in this sense, the demand for "global
governance" far exceeds the supply. Since its inception in 1945, there
have only been two occasions (Korea in 1950 and Kuwait in 1991) when the
U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force, and in both instances
the bulk of the forces were provided by the United States. [[In]{.mark}
the most serious cases, especially those involving international
terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, [ethnic
cleansing, civil war, and mass murder, if America does not take the
lead, no other country]{.mark} or organization [is]{.mark} willing or
[able]{.mark} to respond effectively.]{.underline} The deadly cases of
Bosnia (1991--95) and Rwanda (1994) make this clear. In their own way,
so did the demonstrations by the people of Liberia calling for American
intervention to save them from the ravages of predatory militias in a
failed state. [[And the weakness of the international reaction]{.mark}
to ethnic cleansing, rape, and widespread killing [in]{.mark} the
[Darfur]{.mark} region of Western Sudan [provides a more recent
example.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Heg\-\--Iran/ME War

Navy ships in the Middle East heard the first distress signal at 6:12
a.m. Thursday. The Kokuka Courageous, a tanker owned by Japan and bound
from Saudi Arabia to Singapore, had been damaged by an explosive device.
A fire raged in its engine room. The crew was abandoning ship. A second
distress signal came in at 7 a.m. The Front Altair, a Norwegian-owned
tanker bound from the United Arab Emirates to Taiwan, had also been hit.
It, too, was ablaze. The fallout was fast---and furious. Within hours,
oil prices rose four per cent. The U.S. Navy went to provide aid and
investigate the attacks. [The U.N. Security Council called for immediate
consultations to prevent yet another Middle East
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Two tanker companies suspended new
bookings to the oil-producing states in the Persian Gulf. And, amid
already escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, the
blame game began]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In Washington, [the
[Trump]{.mark} Administration [charged that Iran was
responsible]{.mark}]{.underline} for the two attacks on Thursday, and
also attacks on four other tankers, on May 12th. All six ships were
struck in the Gulf of Oman, the body of water between Oman and Iran,
just beyond the Strait of Hormuz. "This assessment is based on
intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute
the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact
that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and
proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication," Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. The
Administration provided no specific intelligence about why it believed
that Iran was responsible for Thursday's incidents or the attacks in
May. On Thursday, the U.S. reportedly spotted an [unexploded limpet
mine](https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/gulf-of-oman-incident-latest-intl/index.html)
near one of the stricken ships. Both tankers were hit "at or below the
waterline, in close proximity to the engine room while underway," the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners reported. "These
appeared to be well-planned and coordinated." [In Tehran, [the Islamic
Republic denied responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Foreign Minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1139108730996477952),
"Suspicious doesn't begin to describe what likely transpired this
morning." He noted that the attacks on a Japanese-owned tanker occurred
while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was meeting with Iran's Supreme
Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "for extensive and friendly talks." Abe
had made the first visit by a Japanese Prime Minister since the 1979
Revolution, to carry a message from [President
Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), who visited Tokyo
last month. Zarif added, "Iran's proposed Regional Dialogue Forum is
imperative" to defuse tensions between the Islamic Republic and the Gulf
sheikhdoms. [Some experts suggested that both countries share some
blame, with the world shouldering the costs. **"If Iran is the culprit,
the Trump Administration has only itself to blame for pushing Tehran to
take aggressive steps that it has eschewed since the worst days of the
Iran-Iraq War,"**]{.underline} Ali Vaez, the director of the
International Crisis Group's Iran program, told me. "If Iran wasn't
behind it, it's being framed by those who want to see a war between Iran
and the U.S." [[Rising tensions in the Persian Gulf and the Red
Sea,]{.mark} he added, "are bound to increase the risk premium on global
energy prices."]{.underline} Meanwhile, the rest of the world is
fretting. "[We are just about as close to a conflict without there being
an actual armed conflict]{.underline}, so **[[the tensions are very
high]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime
security for the bimco shipping-group association,
[told](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/06/13/world/europe/ap-eu-persian-gulf-tensions-reaction.html)
the Associated Press. bimco represents about sixty per cent of the
world's merchant fleet, including the owners of the two tankers that
were damaged on Thursday. [Roughly a third of the world's seaborne oil
trade goes through the Strait of Hormuz[. European governments issued
[urgent
warnings](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/jun/13/tanker-crisis-gulf)
about the dangers of conflict in the Gulf region.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Germany, one of the biggest proponents of the 2015
nuclear-nonproliferation deal, called the incident "extremely worrying."
But Russia cautioned against leaping to attach blame. **["[Lately we
have been seeing a strengthening campaign of political, psychological,
and military pressure on Iran.]{.mark} We wouldn't want the events that
have just happened, which are tragic and shook the world oil market, to
be used speculatively to further aggravate the situation in an
anti-Iranian sense,"]{.underline}** Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov
[said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-tanker-russia-iran/russia-says-dont-use-tanker-attacks-to-pressure-iran-ria-idUSKCN1TE1X6).
But the Trump Administration charged that Thursday's twin tanker attacks
reflect a broader pattern of recent provocations by Iran that "should be
understood in the context of forty years of unprovoked aggression
against freedom-loving nations," Pompeo said. On April 22nd, the Islamic
Republic pledged that it would interrupt the flow of oil through the
Strait of Hormuz if Washington's "maximum-pressure campaign" blocked all
Iranian exports. "It is now working to execute on that promise," Pompeo
said. In May, the Revolutionary Guards attempted to deploy dhows capable
of launching missiles. Tehran was also tied, through a proxy militia in
Yemen, to an attack, on May 14th, on two strategic oil pipelines in
Saudi Arabia and a missile strike, on Wednesday, on the arrivals
terminal of the kingdom's Abha International Airport, Pompeo claimed.
Twenty-six people were injured in the airport strike. The Administration
has also alleged that Iran, through its allies, was connected to a
rocket that landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on May 19th and a
car bomb in Afghanistan on May 31st that wounded four U.S. service
members. Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear
threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the
freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable campaign of escalating
tension by Iran," Pompeo said. [**[Tensions in the Gulf are an eerie
echo of the tanker war]{.mark} that erupted [in the late
eighties]{.mark} during the eight-year conflict between Iraq and Iran.**
The tanker war was launched in 1984, when Iraq attacked Iran's oil
terminal and oil tankers at Kharg Island, in the northern Persian
Gulf.]{.underline} Iran responded by striking tankers---initially from
Kuwait and later from other nations---that ferried Iraqi oil. In 1987,
as the tanker war threatened to disrupt global oil supplies, [the Reagan
Administration intervened]{.underline}. It re-registered Kuwaiti ships
under the American flag, which allowed the U.S. Navy to provide military
protection. Operation Earnest Will became the largest U.S. naval convoy
operation since the Second World War. It included carrier battle groups
from the Navy, Air Force awacssurveillance planes, and U.S. Army Special
Operations Forces. At one point, some thirty ships were deployed to
escort tankers from the volatile Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.
**[The U.S. intervention to protect tankers also led to direct military
action with Iran]{.underline}**. In September, 1987, U.S. aircraft
spotted the Iran Ajr pushing mines into Gulf waters. Helicopter gunships
opened fire. By the time the attack was over, four Iranian sailors were
dead, the rest of the crew had abandoned ship (and were picked up by the
U.S. Navy), and the ship was scuttled. The timing of the U.S. attack was
particularly painful for Iran. Khamenei, who was then Iran's President,
was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly---the [first
visit](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-06-mn-1707-story.html)
by a top revolutionary leader since the 1979 upheaval that overthrew the
shah. His trip followed the first covert contacts between Washington and
Tehran in what became known as the arms-for-hostage swap during the
Reagan Administration. In 1986, top White House officials led a [secret
mission](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/world/iran-says-mcfarlane-and-4-others-went-to-tehran-on-a-secret-trip.html)
to Iran. Although that diplomacy collapsed, Khamenei's trip in 1987 was
designed to signal Tehran's willingness to engage with the world.
Instead, the visit was overtaken by Iran's mining misadventure. "It was
a peaceful merchant ship," the Iranian President insisted, at a
breakfast that I attended with a small group of journalists. "This is
the beginning of a series of events, the bitter consequences of which
will not be restricted to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. shall receive a
proper response for this abominable act. Today, it is we who receive the
dead bodies of our sons. But if, God forbid, the day comes when you will
receive the dead bodies of your sons, people will say, 'Why didn't you
stop it?' " Over the years, Iranian officials have repeatedly told me
that the humiliating experience in New York was formative to Khamenei's
thinking about the United States. He has long held that the U.S. attack
on the Iran Ajr was designed to undermine his U.N. speech---and him
personally. Two years later, Khamenei was selected as the Islamic
Republic's second Supreme Leader, a position he has held for three
decades. He has frequently said at public events that the United States
can't be trusted, and he said it again after his meeting with Abe on
Thursday. "You said Mr. \@abeshinzo, that Trump has said negotiations
with the U.S. would lead to Iran's progress," the Supreme Leader tweeted
on his English-language account. "By the Grace of God, without
negotiations & despite sanctions, we will progress[." In [an ominous
sign for the prospects of]{.mark} diplomacy [deëscalating the Gulf
crisis anytime soon,]{.mark} Trump responded with his own tweet. "While
I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about
making a deal," he wrote. "They are not ready, and neither are
we."]{.underline}

#### Escalation with Iran is likely and would spread across the Middle East

Ali **Harb**, **5-10**-2019, Harb is a writer based in Washington, DC.
He reports on US foreign policy, Arab-American issues, civil rights and
politics "\'Thousands could die\': Are US and Iran headed for war?",

MJD

When US National Security Adviser [John Bolton announced last week that
Washington was deploying a naval strike group to the Gulf to send a
\"clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime\", many likened
the situation to the lead-up to the Iraq war.]{.underline} Still, a
military confrontation between Washington and Tehran would be nothing
like the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, when American troops reached
Baghdad in less than a month, analysts told Middle East Eye this week.
Instead, **[[an all-out US war with Iran would have \"hideous\"
ramifications and may spark deadly battles across the Middle
East.]{.mark} \"In one word, [it would be
catastrophic]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** said Imad Harb, director of
research and analysis at Arab Center Washington DC. This week, US
President Donald Trump reimposed a series of strict
[sanctions](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/Trump-imposes-new-sanctions-iran)
on Tehran and did not rule out a direct military confrontation between
the two countries. That came after [US officials warned about the
possibility of Iranian attacks on [US
forces](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/u-s-officials-iran-official-ok-d-attacks-american-military-n1003421)
and [commercial
ships](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-shipping/u-s-warns-merchant-ships-of-possible-iranian-attacks-in-middle-east-idUSKCN1SG1MX).]{.underline}
For its part, Iran announced plans to [pull
out](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-quits-parts-2015-nuclear-deal-and-lays-down-ultimatum)
of parts of the 2015 nuclear deal that Washington abandoned last year,
and called on European leaders to protect it against United States
sanctions. [This latest round of tensions has led some observers to
wonder whether some US officials]{.underline}, especially the
interventionist hawks in the Trump administration[, may be manoeuvring
towards all-out war with Iran. **Should that happen, Harb painted a
doomsday scenario in which Iran would not only retaliate against US
troops in the region, but would also target the Arab Gulf countries
hosting those American forces.** Tehran and its allies in Yemen may also
block or at least disrupt the straits of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandeb, the
passageways into the Gulf and Red Sea]{.underline}, crippling
international trade. **[\"[Iran is not going to go down without harming
others,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Harb said. \"We\'re talking about a
Gulf that\'s anywhere between 35 and 70 miles-wide, and on the western
coast \... we have Saudi and UAE installations. And Iran is not going to
spare them if things really come to a head.\" In fact, the same
countries that have pushed the US to adopt a more confrontational
approach to Iran - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - may be
the ones to pay the price if violence breaks out. \"The Gulf countries -
Saudi Arabia and the UAE - should really be cautious about what they
wish for \... because if Iran is to be vanquished, it\'s going to hit
them really hard,\" Harb told MEE. \'The Iranians will respond\'
**[[Beyond the Gulf region, Iran has proxies and allies in]{.mark} Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.]{.underline}** Tehran
could respond to a US attack by persuading Hezbollah, its ally in
Lebanon, to fire rockets on Israel, said Barbara Slavin, director of the
Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. [[That would cause a
\"massive confrontation]{.mark}\" in which Trump would come to Israel\'s
aid,]{.underline} she said. \"Thousands of people could die. This could
be just hideous,\" she told MEE. \"That would be the worst-case
scenario, that it expands and affects all kinds of civilian populations
in a number of countries.\" Despite the fatally disastrous consequences
of a potential war, Slavin said the conflict does have the potential to
escalate. Acting US Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan
[vowed](https://twitter.com/ActingSecDef/status/1125454376506732545)
earlier this week to hold Tehran accountable for \"any attack\" on US
forces and interests in the region. In that context, an assault on US
troops by an Iran-allied militia may start a spiral of escalation,
Slavin said. \"[[It doesn\'t take much]{.mark} imagination [to envision
a]{.mark}n absolutely horrible [war that would bring in Iran\'s proxies
and US allies, as well as US troops throughout the
region]{.mark}]{.underline},\" she said. **[With US military bases and
Iran-backed forces spread across the region, often in close proximity,
[any local confrontation could quickly escalate into a transnational
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist
and author of the book, Hezbollah between 1982 and 2016, dismissed the
possibility of war but warned that if violence breaks out, it will not
be limited to one battlefield. Should the US directly strike Iran, all
bets are off, Kassir told MEE in an email. \"The Iranians will respond.
All the fields of confrontation will be open,\" he said. Prospects of
escalation [The recent tensions come a year after Trump withdrew
Washington from the multilateral Iran nuclear deal that saw Tehran scale
back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of international
sanctions.]{.underline} Trump adopted a hardline on Iran from the start
of his political career, but he has also voiced opposition to foreign
wars, vowing to put America\'s interests first. Still, the US president
also has surrounded himself with hawkish policy advisers - and it\'s no
secret that some of his top aides, including Bolton and Rudy Giuliani,
Trump\'s personal lawyer, want to overthrow the Iranian government. \"I
don\'t know when we\'re going to overthrow them. It could be in a few
days, months, a couple of years, but it\'s going to happen,\" Giuliani
[said](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/giuliani-calls-new-iranian-revolution-anti-government-rally)
last year at a rally for Mojahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian opposition group
that was on the US list of terrorist groups as recently as 2012.
\"They\'re going to be overthrown, the people of Iran have obviously had
enough,\" Giuliani said. For now, [the Trump administration says its
main strategy is to apply \"maximum pressure\" on Iran to get it to
behave like a \"normal state\".]{.underline} Last year, US Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo issued a list of [12
demands](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-threatens-crush-iran-outlines-12-point-list-new-deal)
that would effectively neutralise Iranian influence in the Middle East
in order for the US to lift sanctions. Among the requirements, Tehran
would have to end its nuclear programme; stop supporting militant
organisations in the region, including Hezbollah, Hamas and Iraqi
paramilitary groups; and withdraw its forces from Syria. Suzanne
Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy programme at the
Brookings Institution, said the administration\'s ultimate goal is to
either drastically change Tehran\'s behaviour, or to alter the \"nature
of the character of the Iranian leadership\". **[\"[The biggest threat
is]{.mark} that of [inadvertent escalation]{.mark},]{.underline}**\" she
said. [\"I don\'t think either side wants to precipitate a full-scale,
bilateral military conflict. But it\'s clear that there are tools at the
disposal of both countries that can be deployed in ways that could
precipitate a crisis beyond where we are today.\"]{.underline} Still,
Maloney told MEE she is confident that tensions will remain contained,
as they have in past crises, even at the height of the Iran-Iraq war,
when Washington and Tehran had naval skirmishes in the Gulf. [\"We can
rely on some degree of mutual preference to avoid
escalation]{.underline},\" she said. Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at
the Middle East Institute, echoed Maloney\'s remarks that neither side
is interested in war. \"Here\'s what we do know. Iran doesn\'t want to
go to war. The United States - certainly Trump - doesn\'t want to go to
war. That, pretty much, \[is what\] we can bank on,\" Vatanka told MEE.
No \'deep planning\' In fact, Trump on Thursday urged Tehran to
[call](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-wants-speak-iran-refuses-rule-out-military-confrontation)
him and negotiate a \"fair deal\". **[Despite the president\'s more
conciliatory tone, [ruling out a military confrontation between the US
and Iran would be a \"stretch]{.mark}\",]{.underline}** Vatanka said, as
Washington\'s warning that it would blame Iran for any attack on US
troops or interests in the region is broad. \"Somebody in Iraq can do
something against US forces and the US can decide that somebody is tied
to Iran and seek to punish Iran. That\'s how this could escalate,\" he
said. And while some members of the Trump administration have advocated
regime change in Tehran, Vatanka said that\'s unlikely - [toppling the
Iranian government would require strategic planning, including
cooperation with local partners who are willing to rise up
together.]{.underline} \"I don\'t see that kind of deep planning from
the Trump administration. What you could expect is punishment - aerial
strikes against key targets in Iran - as a way of showing the Iranians
that the US means business. But that\'s about it,\" Vatanka said. \"I do
not expect boots on the ground or anything like Iraq in 2003.\"

#### Continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia critical to avoid confrontation with Iran

WASHINGTON --- [A senior State Department official on Wednesday defended
the Trump administration's use of an emergency declaration to push
through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates]{.underline}, telling a hostile House committee that
**[[holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial
rivals in China and Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In a contentious
hearing, lawmakers from both parties pressed [R. Clarke
Cooper](https://www.state.gov/assistant-secretary-of-state-for-political-military-affairs-r-clarke-cooper-travels-to-singapore-india-and-sri-lanka/),
the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military
affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to
declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates against Congress's will. Lawmakers are outraged by the
decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late
May to use a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to push through
more than \$8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries are leading [an air war
against rebels in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/20/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-invisible-war-yemen.html?module=inline)
that has resulted in [a humanitarian
disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html?module=inline)
and [thousands of civilian
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html?module=inline),
many of them children. In [both
chambers](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/6/new-bipartisan-legislation-would-halt-arms-sales-to-gulf-countries),
bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales,
many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year. Members
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency
declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr.
Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators
in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place
three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24. During
that briefing, lawmakers "did not hear a single word about an emergency
or a plan to move ahead with this sale," said Representative Eliot L.
Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee. "It's a slap in the face." Mr. Cooper repeatedly declined to
discuss what he called the "predecision" timeline of events but
testified that [[the move came in response to a "significant increase in
intelligence threat streams" related to Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some
American officials and European allies have said the administration [has
been overstating threats tied to
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html?module=inline).
He continued to make the case that [**[if the United States ceased
providing the Saudis with arms, competitors like Russia and China would
seize the opportunity]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Democratic lawmakers were
furious. "I want to know whether Congress was kept in the dark," said
Representative Colin Allred, Democrat of Texas. "If that decision was
reached before we were briefed, I want to know why we weren't told about
it." Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the
committee, said he understood the growing threat from Iran's behavior,
but he called the use of emergency authority "unfortunate." "Some of
these sales will not be ready for delivery for over a year," Mr. McCaul
said, stating his preference that the State Department stick with the
statutory 30-day congressional review. Lawmakers also demanded to know
who was involved in the decision-making process, amid [concerns that
officials with conflicts of
interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/democrats-charles-faulkner-arms-sales.html?module=inline)
were behind the arms sales. Representative William Keating, Democrat of
Massachusetts, asked whether Jared Kushner, the president's senior
adviser and son-in-law, was involved. Mr. Cooper first demurred, then
said he was not. Mr. Kushner is [an ally of Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html?module=inline)
of Saudi Arabia and is hoping the prince will support a peace proposal
for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on which Mr. Kushner has been
working. American intelligence agencies [have concluded that the prince
ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html?module=inline)
[the
killing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html?module=inline)
of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Lawmakers also
pressed Mr. Cooper on the involvement of two officials at the State
Department, Charles Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist who worked
until May 10 in the department's legislative affairs bureau, and [Marik
String](https://projects.propublica.org/trump-town/staffers/marik-string),
a former deputy assistant secretary in Mr. Cooper's bureau who became a
top department legal adviser in late May. Representative Ted Lieu,
Democrat of California, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of
Massachusetts, [sent a letter on
Wednesday](https://lieu.house.gov/sites/lieu.house.gov/files/2019.06.11%20Letter%20to%20State%20IG%20re%20Arm%20Rales.pdf)
to the State Department inspector general asking him to open an inquiry
into Mr. Faulkner's involvement, calling it "a disturbing example of a
conflict of interest and blatant government corruption." The letter
noted that before his job at the State Department, Mr. Faulkner worked
for BGR Group, a lobbying firm that represented Raytheon and was a
registered agent of Saudi Arabia until October. For years, Riyadh paid
the firm to get the Obama and Trump administrations [to support the
Saudi-led war in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-us.html?module=inline).
Mr. Cooper testified on Wednesday that he was "not aware" of Mr.
Faulkner's involvement in the May decision. Democratic legislators who
have been briefed on the intelligence on Iran say the White House and
the Pentagon are overreacting to the threat. [American officials told
reporters in early May that the threat was related to the Iranian
military or Iranian-allied Arab militias that could attack American
interests.]{.underline} "The administration has presented us no evidence
that the gulf countries face any substantially new threat from Iran that
would justify declaring an emergency, or that these weapons, which the
Saudis need to keep bombing Yemen, would even be useful if such a threat
arose," said Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey and a
former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and
labor. "If we allow these arms sales, the effect will be to prolong a
war that does not serve U.S. interests, while signaling to the Saudis
that they can get away with anything," he continued. Critics of the
American involvement in the Yemen war say Congress should continue to
try to use its powers to put a leash on the Trump administration. "If
the administration won't reverse its arms sales decision on its own,
then Congress ought to assert its constitutional prerogatives and
continue to do what it can to force the administration's hand," said
Robert Malley, the president and chief executive of the International
Crisis Group. Members of Congress are also looking at the [Iran
Disinformation Project](https://irandisinfo.org/), which had funding
from the State Department and used social media accounts to attack
American citizens over their views on Iran policy. The project's website
said it was begun in 2018 and funded by the State Department's Global
Engagement Center. The \@IranDisinfo account on Twitter has promoted
posts from the [Foundation for Defense of
Democracies](https://www.fdd.org/), a group in Washington that supports
hard-line policies on Iran. The scandal emerged on May 30 when
Iranian-Americans and Middle East experts [pointed out the online
attacks](https://twitter.com/NegarMortazavi/status/1134168278643949569)
and the ties between the project and the State Department. The agency
then suspended funding for the project. On Monday, a department
spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said that the "implementer went beyond the
scope of their contract." Since he took over the State Department in
April 2018, **[Mr. Pompeo has spoken forcefully of the [need to confront
Iran and [weaken its presence in the
region](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/world/middleeast/iran-us-war.html?module=inline)]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
In [a memo he sent to
Congress](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1109-pompeo-memo-arms-sales/0300852ef550787be7dc/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
on May 24 to inform it of the emergency declaration, he said [that the
Houthis, the Yemeni rebel group, were an "Iran-supported force
increasingly contributing to the Iranian regime's efforts to destabilize
the Arabian Peninsula."]{.underline}

### Heg\-\--Turns Soft Power

#### US soft power is inevitable but fails\-\--countries always default to hard power -- empirics

Alistair **Burnett, 15**, 1-8-2015, editor of The World Tonight, a BBC
News program, \"China, Russia and the US Juggle Soft and Hard Power\",
\[https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/china-russia-and-us-juggle-soft-and-hard-power\],
AVD

LONDON: [This year has seen marked resurgence in the use of hard power
by states]{.underline} in pursuit of national interests. [The US return
to]{.underline} military action in [[Iraq]{.mark} and]{.underline}
direct intervention in [Syria, Russia's annexation of [Crimea]{.mark}
and]{.underline} destabilization of eastern Ukraine and [[China's
assertion of its territorial claims]{.underline}]{.mark} in the East and
South China seas [[are just three examples of]{.mark} major powers
**[turning to force]{.mark}** and coercion to achieve strategic
aims]{.underline}. Yet, [[not]{.mark} so long ago, talk in
[diplomatic]{.mark}]{.underline}, academic and journalistic [circles
focused on]{.underline} the growing importance of [soft
power]{.underline} in international relations. In recent years,
[governments consider how to boost soft power, investing
heavily]{.underline} in tools like international broadcasting and
cultural institutes [to win friends abroad]{.underline}. China has spent
billions expanding China Central TV's broadcasts in English and other
languages and opening 450 Confucius Institutes around the world teaching
Chinese language and culture. It has even invested in trying to create
global pop star Jia Ruhan. Russia has expanded its international TV news
station, RT. The US continues to fund international broadcasting started
during the Cold War. These are all efforts to influence the views of
people in other countries, winning them over to a way of thinking so
they will pressure their governments -- even in authoritarian states --
to fall into line with new policies. [The US is considered the world
leader in soft]{.underline} and hard [power, and there's no doubt
American culture is attractive to many]{.underline} around the world --
consider the numbers wanting to migrate there and who wear baseball
caps, eat American-style fast food, listen to American music and watch
Hollywood movies. [Much of the global attractiveness of the US has
**little to do with its government**, and photographs of anti-American
protesters in]{.underline} the Middle East in [jeans]{.underline} and
T-shirts [demonstrate how it's possible to **like American culture** and
**dislike Washington's policies**]{.underline}. But while the US has
accumulated a lot of this soft power without having to spend a cent,
relying instead on the sheer attractiveness of American society, the
government still takes steps to manipulate attitudes. One little
publicized effort is how the Pentagon influences its on-screen image
through its film liaison office which can save Hollywood producers
millions in special effects by providing hardware and personnel on
approved scripts. But do [events of the past year suggest that in a
world where the global balance of power is shifting]{.underline} and
countries really want their own way, [they turn to]{.underline}
old-fashioned [hard power]{.underline}? Harvard Professor Joe Nye who
coined the term "soft power" argues it is not a binary choice. He
developed on his original definition of power by identifying a third way
states could convince others to do what they wanted -- with "smart
power" -- basically wielding a mix of hard and soft power. Looking at
how [the United States, Russia and China]{.underline} have conducted
themselves through this lens shows all three [are trying]{.underline} --
with varying levels of success -- [to use smart power]{.underline}.
[Before using military force in Iraq and Syria]{.underline} against
Islamic State, the [Obama]{.underline} administration [utilized soft
power to maximize impact of the use of its hard power. Washington was
keen that its intervention was not seen as unilateral]{.underline}
action by aggressive Christian states against Muslims, so it portrayed
IS as an enemy of fellow Muslims. Washington also emphasizes it
intervenes in Iraq at the invitation of Baghdad and has been successful
in building a coalition including leading Sunni Arab states to carry out
airstrikes in Syria. So far the campaign has slowed IS down. [In
Ukraine, Russia's campaign to take Crimea]{.underline} and destabilize
the eastern part of the country [has been called hybrid warfare because
of its mix of diplomacy]{.underline}, TV and social media propaganda
about the threat to Russian speakers from Ukrainian nationalists, and
use of irregular and disguised forces designed for ambiguity long enough
to achieve Russian objectives. In the case of Crimea, annexed with
little fighting, acute observers of Russian policy see this as an
effective use of smart power. Stalemate in eastern Ukraine suggests it
may be less effective there. [Beijing's attempt to use smart power has
met with mixed results]{.underline}. In the South China Sea, China
claims waters also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei
and Taiwan. It has spent recent years reassuring neighbors it's not a
threat despite its growing economic and military strength. But, earlier
this year, China sent an oil exploration vessel into an area Vietnam
also claims leading to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese ships.
Tensions with the Philippines emerged after Chinese ships tried to block
Filipino efforts to resupply a garrison of marines on a disputed atoll.
The result was anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam, diplomatic protests by the
Philippines, and both countries establishing closer military ties with
the United States. [[The long-term effectiveness of the return to hard
power is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[**more dependent**]{.mark} on
the military and economic [strength of the United States]{.mark}, Russia
and China [than their **international image**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Russia will probably hang on to Crimea because Ukraine is the weaker
state and shows no real appetite to get it back. China's economic
preponderance in the South China Sea region means its neighbors, while
not rolling over, will probably meet it more than halfway in the
resolving the maritime disputes. The US battle with what's now called IS
really goes back to the 2003 Iraq invasion which allowed jihadis to get
a foothold in the country by presenting themselves as the resistance to
infidel invaders. The extremists extended their power to western Iraq
and Syria after 2011 when the Syrian civil war broke out and US troops
left Iraq. Ultimately, defeating IS depends on a political solution in
Syria and an Iraqi government truly inclusive of Sunnis as well as Shias
and Kurds. In all these cases though, soft power is being deployed in
subtle ways to attract support by trying to "shape the narrative" by
portraying rivals and enemies as acting outside shared global norms and
values. The United States claims to defend Muslims from the Islamic
extremism; Russia says it defends Russian-speakers from Ukrainian
nationalists; and China describes itself as a rising, but peace-loving
nation. The success of these attempts depends not just on the language
and imagery used by officials, but also on whether the media and other
opinion- formers adopt similar language and imagery. [Wielding
soft]{.underline} and smart [power is]{.underline} also [complicated
because one country's attractiveness to another is a result of a complex
interplay of what a country has to offer and how the offer is
perceived]{.underline}. For instance, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has appeal in a country like Burma, because
many]{.underline} people there [want democratic elections and free
speech]{.underline} after decades of repression, [while many Pakistanis
dislike the United States]{.underline}, regarding it as a country that
doesn't respect their sovereignty while also [killing many of
citizens]{.underline} in its anti-terror operations. [The increasing use
of hard power is partly a result of the changing global balance as other
countries take advantage of the relative decline of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates to assert their
interests. [But the [difficulties and uncertainties surrounding]{.mark}
how to]{.underline} best [wield [soft power]{.mark}]{.underline} and
measure its effectiveness also [[explain why leaders are still attracted
to]{.mark} using **familiar [hard-power methods]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} be
they airstrikes or economic sanctions]{.underline}.

Altogether, the [[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[severely challenged
by]{.mark} all]{.underline} that [it has to undertake. [Domestic
security]{.mark}]{.underline} will continue to [absorb]{.underline} a
[significant]{.underline} part of the military's [effort]{.underline},
and the army will accordingly be deployed largely within China's
borders. Protecting national territory from invasion and [[supporting
territorial claims]{.underline}]{.mark} with credible military options
will [remain high on the]{.underline} military's task [list, [Taiwan
above all else.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Missions beyond]{.mark}
Taiwan,]{.underline} whatever they will be, are more likely to
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark} on areas [[closer to China's periphery and
less likely to develop in a major way]{.underline}]{.mark} [in more
distant theaters]{.underline}. [[Nuclear deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}
will remain a priority and [become [more
complicated]{.mark}]{.underline} if China's [[neighbors continue to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark} their arsenals and missile defenses. [[Even
as]{.mark} Chinese [military power grows, it is tied down]{.mark} by
many nearby challenges**. [It cannot mount a challenge of geostrategic
proportions to the militaries of major rivals unless those rivals make
their own decisions to yield]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Even as the PLA
modernizes, [other militaries in the region]{.underline} and beyond [are
also improving]{.underline} technology, increasing capabilities,
upgrading training, and adjusting strategies. [Japan stands
out]{.underline} as a country that has quietly developed a suite of
cutting-edge space technologies: in addition to Ballistic Missile
Defense capabilities developed in cooperation with the United States,
Japan is working on reusable launch vehicles (i.e., space planes);
multifunctional satellites that provide missile early-warnings and help
with navigation, communication, and targeting; warhead reentry
technologies that can advance the use of missiles; unmanned aerial
vehicles; and technologies for space situational awareness that show
concern for possible future conflict in space. [South Korea is
modernizing]{.underline} its military, including its navy, although
focusing its efforts on the threat from North Korea. [India is
upgrading]{.underline} its navy, although most of its defense efforts
are focused on dealing with Pakistan. [Vietnam and other]{.underline}
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
([ASEAN]{.underline}) [are upgrading]{.underline} their militaries. The
[littoral states]{.underline} around the Straits of Malacca, Sunda, and
Lombok are [improving]{.underline} their navies, reluctant to concede
much responsibility to outsiders for security along their shores. Above
all, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [continues to improve
its capabilities in the region]{.underline} around China despite the
strain imposed by operations elsewhere in the world. During a 2011 visit
to East Asia, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta assured U.S. allies
that, after a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States
''will always maintain a strong presence in the Pacific.'' 14 Also in
2011, President Barack Obama made even stronger assurances during a
visit to Australia, insisting that the United States was a ''Pacific
power and we are here to stay.'' 15 He backed the rhetoric with the
announcement of an agreement to [station]{.underline} U.S. [Marines in
northern Australia]{.underline}. According to the 2010 Quadrennial
Defense Review (QDR), U.S. defense [posture]{.underline} in the
Asia---Pacific and elsewhere will [remain ''forward
stationed]{.underline} and \[with\] rotationally deployed forces,
capabilities and equipment; \[a\] supporting network of infrastructure
and facilities; \[and\] a series of treaty, access, transit, and
status-protection agreements and arrangements with allies and key
partners.'' 16 Doctrinal and technological innovations coming online
significantly [enhance]{.underline} the accuracy [and expand the
reach]{.underline} of U.S. intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,
and strike capabilities. In effect, the
[[Asia---Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[experiencing a
permanent]{.underline}]{.mark}, almost routinized, multilateral [[arms
race]{.mark} of which]{.underline} the much-discussed [growth of the
Chinese]{.underline} military [is only a part]{.underline}. In this
environment of change, episodes of friction among militaries will
continue to occur and shifts will take place in the relative balance of
power in various theaters. But **[[unless other nations pull
back]{.mark} from their own programs]{.underline}** of military
development, [[China's overstretched military]{.mark} simply [cannot
expel other]{.mark} major [militaries from China's own region,]{.mark}
still [less from regions farther away.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Former President George W. Bush\'s critics liked to say that during his
term America was \"getting its derriere kicked\" by China. By this the
critics presumably meant that the war in Iraq was a big distraction and
that the United States was not attending enough Asian multilateral
conferences and showing off its \"soft power.\" While the case was never
overwhelming, it contained a kernel of truth.
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} did [[gain regional influence at
Washington\'s expense]{.underline}]{.mark} under former President
Bush\'s watch. Now President Barack Obama is doing his predecessor one
better: By imposing draconian defense cuts, heavily targeted on
high-technology weapons systems and \"power-projection\" platforms
essential to preserving [[U.S. military superiority]{.mark} in the
Pacific]{.underline}, America may not have much of a derriere left in
Asia at all. Though \"soft power\" and \"smart power\" are all the rage
in foreign-policy circles, [[Asia remains a]{.mark} dangerous [place
where]{.mark}]{.underline} good, old-fashioned [\"[hard power\" still
matters]{.mark}. Certainly China and North Korea think so. [Pyongyang
poses]{.mark} [a major]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional
[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to South Korea and is inching closer [to
[obtaining delivery systems for nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons
that can pose a threat both to Japan and the continental U.S.
Pyongyang\'s ballistic missile launch this month is only the latest sign
of its growing threat to regional security. [[China has built up its
military]{.mark}]{.underline} across the board. Its submarine fleet has
grown faster than any other in the world, it now has a large and lethal
arsenal of conventional cruise and ballistic missiles, and it has
[[announced plans to deploy aircraft carrier]{.mark}s]{.underline}.
Worrying about China is [far from a case of]{.underline} what Defense
Secretary Robert Gates calls \"next [war]{.underline}-itis.\" The U.S.
isn\'t in a war with China \-- mercifully \-- [but there is]{.underline}
a [military competition. China has]{.underline} already [changed the
military balance in the]{.underline} Asia-Pacific [region]{.underline}
to the great consternation of America\'s key allies, such as Japan and
India. The point is [not that Washington is poised to go to
war]{.underline} with North Korea and China. To the contrary, [[only by
maintaining its role as Asia\'s security guarantor can the U.S. hope to
secure an enduring peace in this dynamic region.]{.underline}]{.mark}

a significant increase in the military budget; expansion of Buy American
rules for government procurement; and tough steps on trade to level the
playing field for American workers, businesses and farmers. [To this
long list of measures to improve America's economic and national
security, we should now add the actions recommended in a new Department
of Defense report]{.underline}. [This yearlong effort,]{.underline}
carried out at the president's order, [constitutes [the first
governmentwide assessment of America's]{.mark} manufacturing and
[military industrial base]{.mark}. It [identifies almost 300
vulnerabilities]{.mark}, ranging from dependencies on foreign
manufacturers to looming labor shortages.]{.underline} For example,
**[the report highlights [several "single points of failure"]{.mark}
involving the reliance on a single source of critical equipment or
material, including propeller shafts for our ships, gun turrets for our
tanks, fuel for our rockets and space-based infrared detectors for
missile defense]{.underline}**. A military-grade impregnated carbon
product used in 72 different chemical, biological and nuclear filtration
systems has only a single Defense Department-qualified source, and this
current sourcing arrangement can't keep pace with demand. Or consider
wrought aluminum plate --- an essential component in armoring ground
combat vehicles, constructing Navy ships and building military aircraft.
[According to the report, budget uncertainties, unpredictable demand
from the Defense Department and the effects of foreign competition raise
the risk of potential "production bottlenecks during a future surge in
D.O.D. requirements" for the material]{.underline}. More broadly, "sharp
peaks" followed by "significant breaks or valleys in production" have
taken a heavy toll on the shipbuilding industry, a sector critical to
constructing and maintaining our aircraft carriers, submarines and
surface ships. **[[A core threat to the American industrial base comes
from China.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to the report, "China
represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials
deemed strategic and critical to U.S. national security," including a
"growing number of both widely used and specialized metals, alloys and
other materials, including rare earths and permanent magnets." [The
American military is also heavily dependent on foreign suppliers in such
critical areas as printed circuit boards, machine tools, materials for
propulsion systems and even nuclear warheads.]{.underline} As the report
notes: "Because the supply chain is globalized and complex, it is
challenging to ensure that finished assemblies, subsystems, and systems"
for nuclear warheads utilize "trusted, discrete components due to
diminishing U.S.-based microelectronic and electronic manufacturing
capability." **[[Even the lowly, but increasingly high-tech, tent is at
risk.]{.underline}]{.mark}** With much of the American textile industry
moving offshore, the United States no longer has the capability to
manufacture high-tenacity polyester fiber. A similar problem exists for
rechargeable batteries, which are vital parts across myriad
applications[. **[One of the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[biggest
vulnerabilities]{.mark} identified in the report [is a shortage of
skilled labor for critical jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [America is
simply not generating enough workers in the science, technology,
engineering and mathematics fields to fill jobs in sectors such as
electronic controls, nuclear engineering and space. Nor are we training
enough machinists, welders and other skilled trade workers to build and
maintain our ships, combat vehicles and aircraft.]{.underline} To
address these vulnerabilities, the Trump administration will immediately
begin implementing the report's "blueprint for action." It will rapidly
expand the use of already available Defense Department funds to close
identified supply-chain gaps. Starting fast out of the gate, the
president will sign determinations authorizing the use of funds, set
aside in Title III of the Defense Production Act, to expand
manufacturing capabilities in such areas as lithium seawater batteries
(critical for anti-submarine warfare) and cutting-edge fuel cells (for
the Navy's future unmanned, underwater vehicles). The Pentagon's
National Defense Stockpile Program, created in 1939 to secure adequate
supplies of foreign-produced and limited-source strategic and critical
materials, will likewise shift into high gear to help build up reserves
in key areas. The broader goal, as the report makes clear, is to
"diversify away from complete dependency on sources of supply in
politically unstable countries who may cut off U.S. access." An
essential Pentagon mission will be to further modernize the "organic
industrial base" to ensure American leadership in advanced manufacturing
across industrial sectors. This government-owned and -operated network
of depots, shipyards and arsenals sustains some 440,000 vehicles, 780
strategic missiles, 278 combat ships and almost 14,000 aircraft. As part
of the governmentwide effort, the president is also directing the
secretary of labor to more precisely target occupations for current and
future growth (e.g., systems engineers, high-skilled tool operators),
expand worker training and education programs, and ensure appropriate
incentives to recruit and retain workers. The secretary of energy is
similarly charged with more aggressively addressing risks to the
nation's manufacturing and industrial base within the energy and nuclear
sectors, using funding that will become available in 2019. America has
elected a president in the mold of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt
and Ronald Reagan --- presidents best remembered for short but profound
maxims that directed their boldest strategies and biggest successes.
McKinley's campaign slogan "Patriotism, protection and prosperity" led
to strong tariffs and sound money policies that realigned the Republican
Party and catalyzed strong economic growth. Roosevelt's "Speak softly
and carry a big stick" helped transform the Navy into a military force
capable of projecting power around the world. And Reagan's "Peace
through strength" inspired an unprecedented rebuilding of the military
that brought the Soviet Union to its knees. History will judge whether
Donald Trump's "Economic security is national security" joins the ranks
of great presidential maxims. The recommendations made in the Defense
Department's report will surely be a part of that discussion.

[[The United States continues to dominate the international arms trade,

\$37.7 billion worth of arms, compared to \$222.6 billion in sales by
American producers, according to an annual report by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) released Monday. The
amount of weapons sales from U.S. companies is just shy of six times
higher than those of Russia. But sales from Russia rose 8.5 percent more
than those of the U.S., which reached 2 percent. The United Kingdom also
formerly held the number-two spot for weapons sales, but Russia has now
taken second place in the global ranking. [Overall, [Russian sales
accounted for 9.5 percent]{.mark} of the total from the world's top 100
producers[, and the U.S.]{.mark} sales [accounted for a massive 57
percent]{.mark}.]{.underline} Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher with

by SIPRI suggested that while China's weapons sales had increased, they
only accounted for about 5.7 percent of the world's arms exports between
2013 and 2017. Following the U.S., Russia and the U.K. in the ranking,
France takes the fourth spot with 5.3 percent of global sales.
Trans-European companies account for 3.7 percent, followed by Italy at
2.6 percent and Japan at 2.2 percent. **[[Beyond being the undisputed

#### Strategic and security benefits from arms trading is minimal and the costs far outweigh

The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy", Cato Institute,

https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
MJD

U.S. arms sales policy is out of control. Since 2002, the United States
has sold more than \$197 billion worth of major conventional weapons and
related military support to 167 countries. In just his first year in
office, President Donald Trump inked arms deals at a record pace,
generating hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of potential sales.
Though the president trumpets each deal as a victory for the United
States, an analysis of American arms sales since 2002 reveals that [[the
arms trade is a risky business]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States
has repeatedly sold weapons to nations engaged in deadly conflicts, and
to those with horrendous human rights records, under conditions in which
it has been impossible to predict where the weapons would end up or how
they would be used. On repeated occasions, American troops have fought
opponents armed with American weapons. [Advocates argue that arms sales
bolster American security by enhancing the military capabilities of
allies, providing leverage over the behavior and policies of client
nations, and boosting the American economy while strengthening the
defense industrial base. **We argue that [the economic benefits of arms
sales are dubious and that their strategic utility is far more uncertain
and limited than most realize]{.mark}. Arms sales [also create a host of
negative, unintended consequences for the United
States]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for those buying the weapons, and for the
regions into which American weapons flow. **[[Washington's historical
faith in arms sales is seriously misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The
United States should revise its arms sales policy to improve the risk
assessment process]{.mark}, to ban sales to countries where the risk of
negative consequences is too high, [and]{.mark} to [limit sales to cases
in which they will directly enhance American
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Few tools have been used in pursuit of so
many foreign policy objectives as arms sales. The United States has sold
weapons to its NATO allies to ensure their ability to defend Western
Europe; to friendly governments around the world facing insurgencies and
organized crime; to allies in the Pacific (buffering them against
China's rising military power); and to both Israel and many of its Arab
neighbors in efforts to maintain regional stability and influence over
Middle Eastern affairs. The United States has used arms sales, as well
as the threat of denying arms, in efforts to influence human rights
policies, to help end conflicts, to gain access to military bases, and
to encourage fair elections. Since 9/11, the new central focus of U.S.
weapons sales has been to bolster the global war on
terror.[[36](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor036)
Despite their many uses, arms sales impact foreign affairs through two
basic mechanisms. The first involves using arms sales to shift the
balance of power and capabilities between the recipient and its
neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter adversaries, promote
local and regional stability, or buttress friendly governments against
insurgencies and other internal
challenges]{.underline}.[37](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor037)
During the Cold War, American arms sales became part of a broader
strategy to deter the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. In the
wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States sold weapons to Afghanistan
and Iraq to bolster their ability to defeat the Taliban, al Qaeda, and
the Islamic State. By selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, Japan, South
Korea, and Australia, the United States hoped to balance rising Chinese
power and promote regional stability. **[Although the specific
objectives differ, at root the causal mechanism is the same: using arms
sales to shift the balance of power in a direction more favorable to
American
interests.]{.underline}**[38](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor038)
[The second mechanism involves using arms sales to generate leverage
over the conduct of other nations.]{.underline} As the producer of the
world's most advanced and sought-after weaponry, the United States can
dictate, at least to some degree, the conditions under which it will
agree to sell certain
weapons.[39](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor039)
As Andrew Shapiro puts it, "When a country acquires an advanced U.S.
defense system, they are not simply buying a product to enhance their
security, they are also seeking a relationship with the United States...
[. This engagement helps build bilateral ties and creates strong
incentives for recipient countries to maintain good relations with the
United
States.]{.underline}"[40](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor040)
American influence is thought to be most potent in cases where the
United States provides a nation with a large share of its military
capabilities. In the wake of U.S. pressure to halt Israeli defense
exports to China, for example, an Israeli official acknowledged, "If the
United States, which provides Israel with \$2 billion in annual military
aid, demands that we will not sell anything to China --- then we won't.
If the Americans decide we should not be selling arms to other countries
as well --- Israel will have no choice but to
comply."[41](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor041)
The United States has used arms sales to try to encourage states to vote
with the United States at the UN, to support or adopt pro-Western and
pro-U.S. foreign policies, to convince Egypt and Israel to accept peace
accords, and to gain access to military bases in places such as Greece,
Turkey, Kenya, Somalia, Oman, and the Philippines. After the Cold War,
the United States also sought to tie arms transfers to human rights and
democratization efforts in client
states.[42](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor042)
Arms sales remain attractive to presidents for three main reasons.
First, arms sales are less risky than sending American troops, providing
explicit security guarantees to other nations, or initiating direct
military intervention, even long
distance.[43](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor043)
[In cases where allies or partners are likely to engage in conflicts
with their neighbors, providing weapons rather than stationing troops
abroad can lessen the risk of American entrapment in crises or
conflicts]{.underline}. Taiwan is an example of this sort of
arms-for-troops substitution. On the other hand, in instances where the
United States has an interest in conflicts already underway, arms sales
can be used in attempts to achieve military objectives without putting
American soldiers (or at least putting fewer of them) in harm's way.
This tactic has been a central element of the American war on terror,
with sales (and outright transfers) of weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq
to support the fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and ISIS, as well as
to Saudi Arabia for its war in
Yemen.[44](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor044)
In both situations the reduction of military risk, in particular the
risk of American casualties, also helps reduce the political risk.
Presidents who would otherwise abstain from supporting a nation if it
entailed sending American troops can sell arms to that country without
the political fallout that sending America troops abroad would incur.
Second, arms sales are an extremely flexible tool of statecraft. In
contrast to the blunt nature of military intervention, or the long-term
commitment and convoluted politics that treaties involve, arms sales can
take any form from small to large and can take place on a one-time or
ongoing basis; they can be ramped up or down and started or stopped
relatively quickly, depending on the circumstances. Selling arms to one
nation, moreover, does not prohibit the United States from selling arms
to any other nation. And thanks to their capacity and prestige, American
weapons serve as useful bargaining chips in all sorts of negotiations
between the United States and recipient
nations.[45](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor045)
Finally, arms sales represent a very low-cost and low-friction policy
tool for the White
House.[46](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor046)
Unlike military intervention or stationing troops abroad, arms sales are
not dependent on defense budgets or on a laborious congressional
process. And since most arms deals receive little publicity, presidents
don't have to worry about generating support from the public. As a
result, the president can strike an arms deal unilaterally and at any
time. Moreover, since most political leaders view arms sales as an
economic benefit to the United States, the president tends to receive
far more encouragement than pushback on the vast majority of arms deals.
**[Inevitably, [the fact that arms sales are low cost and easy to
implement means that presidents reach for them frequently, even if they
are not necessarily the best tool for the job.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Strategic and hegemonic benefits would be far greater if we limited foreign arms sales

What role should arms sales play in American foreign policy? Though
major deals --- like Trump's \$110 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia
announced in 2017 or the decision to sell arms to Ukraine --- provoke
brief periods of discussion, there is no real debate in Washington about
the wisdom of exporting vast quantities of weapons around the globe to
allies and nonallies alike. Congress, which has the authority to cancel
arms deals, has not impeded a deal since the passage of the 1976 Arms
Export Control Act created the framework for doing so. Since 9/11 the
pace of sales has increased. From 2002 to 2016, the United States sold
roughly \$197 billion worth of weapons and related military support to
167
countries.[1](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor001)
In just his first year Donald Trump cut a deal worth as much as \$110
billion to Saudi Arabia alone and notified Congress of 157 sales worth
more than \$84 billion to 42 other
nations.[2](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor002)
Despite losing market share over the past two decades because of
increasing competition, [the United States still enjoyed the largest
share of the global arms trade between 2012 and 2016 at 33
percent]{.underline}.[3](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor003)
The current consensus in favor of arms sales rests on three planks[.
First, advocates argue that arms sales enhance American security by
bolstering the military capabilities of allies, enabling them to deter
and contain their adversaries, and helping promote stability in critical
areas like the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Second, they argue that
arms sales help the United States exert influence over the behavior and
foreign policies of client nations. Finally, advocates argue that arms
sales provide a boon to the U.S. economy and fiscal benefits in the form
of lower unit costs to the Pentagon, while helping ensure the health of
the American defense industrial
base]{.underline}.[4](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor004)
**[We argue, however, that [Washington's faith in]{.mark} the wisdom of
foreign [arms sales is seriously misplaced. The benefits tend to be
oversold, and the downsides]{.mark} are often simply
[ignored]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The defense industry and its champions,
in particular, have long exaggerated the economic boon of arms
sales.[5](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor005)
And even if they were greater, economic benefits alone are not worth
subverting strategic considerations. More importantly, **[[the strategic
deficits]{.mark} of arms sales [are severe enough to overwhelm even the
most optimistic economic argument]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is the
strategic case for and against arms sales that we consider in this
analysis. **[[Arms sales create a host of negative, unintended
consequences that warrant a]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} cautious and
[limited approach, even in support of an expansive grand strategy
like]{.mark} [primacy or]{.mark} liberal
[hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**. From the perspective of those who
would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy, the prospective
benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even smaller. [Even in cases
where the United States wants a nation to arm itself, there is rarely a
need for the weapons to come from the United States. Moreover, [the
United States would generate significant diplomatic flexibility and
moral authority by refraining from selling arms**. Given these outsized
risks and nebulous rewards, the United States should greatly reduce
international arms sales.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Arms sales diminish the US's ability to promote peace and regional stability

The Uncertain and Limited Benefits of Arms Sales Attempts to manage the
balance of power and generate influence around the world are heavily
contingent on a number of factors, most of which lie outside American
control. Upon closer review, most of the benefits of arms sales are less
certain and less compelling than advocates claim. [Managing the Balance
of Power: The Illusion of Control. The hidden assumption underlying the
balance of power strategy is that the United States will be able to
predict accurately what the impact of its arms sales will
be]{.underline}. If the goal is deterrence, for example, the assumption
is that an arms sale will be sufficient to deter the adversary without
spawning an arms race. If the goal is to promote stability, the
assumption is that an arms sale will in fact reduce tensions and inhibit
conflict rather than inflame tensions and help initiate conflict. [These
assumptions, in turn, depend on both the recipient nation and that
nation's neighbors and adversaries acting in ways that don't make things
worse. As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions**. Although
arms sales certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient
nation, the fundamental problem is that [arms sales often initiate a
long chain of responses that the United States generally cannot
control.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The United States, after all, is not the
only country with interests in regional balances, especially where the
survival and security of local actors is at stake[. The United States is
neither the only major power with a keen interest in critical regions
like Asia and the Middle East, nor the only source of weapons and other
forms of assistance. Nor can it dictate the perceptions, interests, or
actions of the other nations involved in a given region]{.underline}.
For example, though a nation receiving arms from the United States may
enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is also likely to enjoy
enhanced offensive capabilities. With these, a nation's calculations
about the potential benefits of war, intervention abroad, or even the
use of force against its own population may shift decisively. Saudi
Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this dynamic. Though the Saudis
explain their arms purchases as necessary for defense against Iranian
pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past two years embroiled in a
military intervention in Yemen. Likewise, **[[arms sales can heighten
regional security dilemmas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Neighbors of nations
buying major conventional weapons will also worry about what this
enhanced military capability will mean. This raises the chances that
they too will seek to arm themselves further, or take other steps to
shift the balance of power back in their favor, or, in the extreme case,
to launch a preventive war before they are attacked. Given these
dynamics, [the consequences of arms sales to manage regional balances of
power are far less predictable and often much less positive than
advocates
assume]{.underline}.[54](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor054)
This unpredictability characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts
to manage the balance of power. [The most basic claim of arms sales
advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly governments and allies
should make them better able to deter adversaries. The best available
evidence, however, suggests a more complicated reality]{.underline}.
**[[In a study of arms sales]{.mark} from 1950 to 1995, major-power arms
[sales to existing allies had no effect on the chance that the recipient
would be the target of a military attack. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms
that were not treaty allies were significantly more likely to become
targets]{.mark}.]{.underline}**[55](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor055)
[[Nor is there much evidence that arms sales can help the United States
promote peace and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of
power]{.mark}. On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that [the
default assumption should be the opposite]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Most
scholarly work concludes that arms sales exacerbate instability and
increase the likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}.[56](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor056)
One study, for example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet
arms sales to hostile dyads (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq,
Ethiopia/Somalia) "contributed to hostile political relations and
imbalanced military relationships" and were "profoundly
destabilizing."[57](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor057)

Arms Sales Have Many Potential Negative Consequences [Though arms sales
are of marginal value to national security and the pursuit of national
interests, their [negative consequences are]{.mark} varied and [often
severe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arms sales can spawn unwanted outcomes on
three levels: **[[blowback against the United States and entanglement in
conflicts;]{.mark} regional consequences in the buyer's neighborhood,
such as the dispersion of weapons and increased instability; and
consequences for the buyer itself, such as increased levels of
corruption, human rights abuses, and civil conflict.]{.underline}**
Effects on the United States. [Though the goal of arms sales is to
promote American security and U.S. interests abroad, at least two
possible outcomes can cause serious consequences for the United States.
The first of these --- [blowback --- occurs when a former ally turns
into an adversary and uses the weapons against the United
States]{.mark}. The second --- [entanglement --- is a process whereby an
arms sales relationship draws the United States into a greater level of
unwanted intervention.]{.mark}]{.underline} Blowback. The fact that the
United States has sold weapons to almost every nation on earth, combined
with frequent military intervention, means that blowback is an
inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales policy. American troops and their
allies have faced American-made weapons in almost every military
engagement since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama, Haiti,
Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And even where the United
States has not yet engaged in combat, American arms sales have bolstered
the military capabilities of adversaries once counted as friendly.
[[Blowback can occur in at least three ways. First, a previously
friendly regime becomes unfriendly]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example,
the United States sold billions of dollars in weapons to the Shah of
Iran during the 1970s in the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing
influence on the Middle East. The sales included everything from fighter
jets for air campaigns to surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy
fighters.[70](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor070)
After the 1979 revolution, however, Iran used those weapons in its war
with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in
the region. Panama, the recipient of decades of American military
assistance, as well as host to a major military base and 9,000 U.S.
troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega --- himself a
CIA asset for more than 20 years --- took power and threatened U.S.
citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops facing
American
weapons.[71](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor071)
[Blowback [also]{.mark} occurs [when the United States sells weapons to
nations]{.mark} (or transfers them to nonstate actors) [that, though not
allies, simply did not register as potential adversaries at the time of
the sale]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States, for example, sold
surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks, and armored personnel
carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few officials would have imagined
that the United States would find itself intervening in Somalia in 1992,
or that the United States and its allies would provide billions in
weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an effort to balance against
Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the battlefield to reverse its
annexation of
Kuwait.[72](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor072)
[[And finally]{.mark}, blowback can occur [when U.S. weapons are sold or
stolen from the government that bought them and wind up on the
battlefield in the hands of the adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, the Reagan administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to
the Mujahideen, who were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the
1980s; they in turn sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea,
among others. More recently, the Islamic State managed to capture from
the Iraqi government a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the United
States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities after the
2003 invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to supply
three divisions of a conventional
army.[73](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor073)
[**[These examples]{.mark} of blowback [demonstrate how difficult it can
be to forecast the long-term outcomes of arms sales and how obvious it
is that selling weapons carries a number of risks]{.mark}.** Predicting
what exactly will happen is hard, but predicting that arms sales to
clients with red flags are likely to end badly is quite easy. Iraq was a
fragile state ravaged by a decade's worth of American intervention and
rife with terrorism and civil conflict; to transfer such large
quantities of weapons to its military and police force under such
conditions was to invite disaster. **Entanglement. [Arms sales raise the
risk of entanglement]{.mark} in two ways**]{.underline}. [First, [they
can represent early steps]{.mark} down the slippery slope [to unwise
military intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Consider a case
like the Syrian civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in which
the United States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters against
oppressive
governments.[74](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor074)
In the majority of those cases, American leaders were wary of
intervening directly. Instead, the United States tended to rely on
money, training, and arms sales. But by taking concrete steps like arms
sales to support rebel groups, Washington's psychological investment in
the outcome tends to rise, as do the political stakes for the president,
who will be judged on whether his efforts at support are successful or
not. As we saw in the Syrian civil war, for example, Barack Obama's
early efforts to arm Syrian rebels were roundly criticized as feckless,
increasing pressure on him to intervene more
seriously.[75](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor075)
History does not provide much guidance about how serious the risk of
this form of entanglement might be. During the Cold War, presidents from
Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a substitute for sending American
troops to do battle with communist forces around the world. The result
was an astonishing amount of weaponry transferred or sold to Third World
nations, many of which were engaged in active conflicts both external
and internal. The risk of superpower conflict made it dangerous to
intervene directly; accordingly, the Cold War-era risk of entanglement
from arms sales was
low.[76](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor076)
Today, however, the United States does not face nearly as many
constraints on its behavior, as its track record of near-constant
military intervention since the end of the Cold War indicates. As a
result, [[the risk of arms sales helping trigger future military
intervention is real]{.mark}, even if it cannot be measured precisely.
The second way in which arms sales might entangle the United States is
by creating new disputes or exacerbating existing tensions]{.underline}.
U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in Syria against the Islamic
State, for example, have ignited tensions between the United States and
its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds as a serious threat to
Turkish sovereignty and
stability.[77](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor077)
Meanwhile, ongoing arms sales to NATO nations and to other allies like
South Korea and Taiwan have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and
North Korea, raising the risk of escalation and the possibility that the
United States might wind up involved in a direct
conflict.[78](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor078)
[Regional Effects. [Arms sales do not just affect the recipient nation;
they also affect the local balance of power,]{.mark} often causing
ripple effects throughout the region]{.underline}. **[Though advocates
of arms sales trumpet their stabilizing influence, as we have noted
above, [arms sales often lead to greater tension, less stability, and
more conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Because of this --- and
the complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- the regional impact
of arms sales is less predictable and more problematic than advocates
acknowledge.

#### Arms sales create, sustain and prolong episodes of conflict and violence and in no way foster regional stability

**[Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, [arms sales can make
conflict more
likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[[79](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor079)
This may occur because recipients of new weapons feel more confident
about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power
can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others]{.underline}.
A study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, for example, found that
[although arms sales appeared to have some restraining effect on
major-power allies, they had the opposite effect in other
cases]{.underline}, and concluded that "**[[increased arms transfers
from major powers make states significantly more likely to be
militarized dispute
initiators]{.mark}."]{.underline}**[80](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor080)
Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that
"arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased
probability of
war."[81](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor081)
Recent history provides supporting evidence for these findings: [since
2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American weapons, has
intervened to varying degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar.
**Second, [arms sales can]{.mark} also [prolong and intensify ongoing
conflicts and erode rather than promote regional
stability]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Few governments, and fewer
insurgencies, have large enough weapons stocks to fight for long without
resupply.[82](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor082)
[The tendency of external powers to arm the side they support, however
understandable strategically, has the inevitable result of allowing the
conflict to continue at a higher level of intensity than would otherwise
be the case]{.underline}. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes,
"Weapons imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed
conflict and
carnage."[83](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor083)
[Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly troublesome with respect
to internal conflicts]{.underline}. Jennifer Erickson, for example,
found that [recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more
likely to engage in internal conflicts than other states.]{.underline}
**[[Though halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for peace and
stability, arms embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness of combat
in both civil and interstate wars simply by restricting access to the
means of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[84](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor084)
**[Finally, because of their effects on both interstate and internal
conflict, arms sales can also erode rather than promote regional
stability.]{.underline}** As noted in the previous section[, [where the
United States seeks to manage regional balances of power, arms sales
often create tension, whether because the American role in the region
threatens others or because American clients feel
emboldened]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Middle East, for example, has
seesawed between violence and tense standoffs for the past many decades,
at first because of Cold War competition and more recently because of
the American war on terror. [The notion that increased U.S. arms sales
since 9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the
least]{.underline}. Similarly, though many argue that American security
commitments to countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have
produced greater stability, there is a strong case to be made that the
opposite is now true. [American support of South Korea has driven North
Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense
systems in South Korea has aggravated China, and American support of
Taiwan produces continual tension between the two
powers.[85](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor085)]{.underline}

#### US military assistance rarely increases security- more often does the opposite

Dispersion. [[The United States uses a number of procedures to try to
ensure that]{.mark} the [weapons it sells]{.mark} actually [go to
authorized customers and to monitor the end use of the weapons so that
they do not wind up being used for nefarious
purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Department of State even compiles a
list of banned countries, brokers, and customers. **[But [most of these
tools have proved
ineffectual]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[86](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor086)
Programs like Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry aim to shed light on the
service life of American weapons sold abroad through end-use
monitoring.[87](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor087)
[While the description of U.S. end-use monitoring ("pre-license,
post-license/pre-shipment, and post-shipment") sounds comprehensive,
it's actually anything but]{.underline}. In fiscal year 2016, the agency
in charge of approving and monitoring arms sales, the Directorate of
Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), authorized 38,398 export-license
applications --- down more than 50 percent from 2012 after the
government shifted some weapons to the Department of Commerce's
purview.[88](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor088)To
oversee more than 35,000 export licenses annually, the DDTC has a
full-time staff of only 171 people. [The Blue Lantern program is
executed by embassy staff in recipient countries but administered back
in Washington by only nine State Department employees and three
contractors.[89](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor089)]{.underline}
**[[Twelve people can't possibly track everything that happens to
billions of dollars' worth of]{.mark} advanced [weaponry transferred to
dozens of countries abroad each year.]{.mark} Nor is the process
designed to correct problems]{.underline}**. On one hand, end-use
violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from
making future purchases. On the other hand, [there is no evidence that
end-use monitoring has changed the pattern of American arms sales in any
way.]{.underline} [The United States in truth has little or no control
over what happens to the weapons it sells to other nations.]{.underline}
The result is that year after year weapons of all kinds end up falling
into the hands of unreliable, risky, or just plain bad actors, at which
point they're used in ways neither the United States nor its customers
intended. American weapons have frequently wound up being used against
Americans in combat. And even more often, local and regional actors,
including criminal gangs, have employed them in their own conflicts. In
civil wars, regime collapse, or other extreme cases, factions steal
weapons and use them for their own purposes, as ISIS did in
Iraq.[90](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor090)
Iraq, as previously noted, provides an excellent case study in the
inability of the United States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S.
efforts to rebuild Iraq's military and security capabilities after the
2003 invasion, the United States sent Iraq roughly \$2.5 billion worth
of American weapons through 2014, including everything from small arms
to "armored personnel carriers, military helicopters, transport
aircraft, anti-tank missiles, tanks, artillery and drones."
[91](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor091)
Despite the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in-country and the very
close relationship between those troops and their Iraqi counterparts,
many of those weapons went missing. Between 2003 and 2008 alone, 360,000
out of 1 million small arms disappeared, along with 2,300 Humvees. A
sizable chunk of this weaponry would later end up in the hands of ISIS.
The Iraqi army, trained and equipped by the American military, dissolved
when faced by ISIS and left their weapons behind for the terrorist group
to pick up and use for conquering and holding territory. A UN Security
Council report found that [[in June 2014 alone "ISIS seized sufficient
Iraqi government stocks]{.mark} from the provinces of Anbar and Salah
al-Din [to arm and equip more than three Iraqi conventional army
divisions]{.mark}."]{.underline}[92](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor092)
Data collected by Conflict Armament Research in July and August of 2014
showed [that **[20 percent of ISIS's ammunition was manufactured in the
United States]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- likely seized from Iraqi
military
stocks.[93](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor093)
**[In short, dispersion [enabled the spread of ISIS]{.mark} and
dramatically raised the costs and dangers of confronting the group on
the battlefield]{.underline}**. Regime Effects. Finally, arms sales can
also have deleterious effects on recipient nations --- promoting
government oppression, instability, and military coups. As part of the
war on drugs, America inadvertently enabled the practice of forced
disappearances. In the cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico,
**[[American weapons feed a dangerous cycle of corruption and
oppression]{.mark} involving the police, the military, and political
leaders]{.underline}**.[94](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor094)
Though the United States provides weapons to Mexico ostensibly for
counternarcotics operations, the arms transferred to the country often
end up being used by police to oppress citizens, reinforcing the
"climate of generalized violence in the country \[that\] carries with it
grave consequences for the rule of
law."[95](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor095)
Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States has
supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external
threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with
mixed results. A study of military aid to Colombia found that "in
environments such as Colombia, international military assistance can
strengthen armed nonstate actors, who rival the government over the use
of
violence."**[[96](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor096)
Recent research reveals that [American assistance programs]{.mark}, like
foreign military officer training, can [increase the likelihood of
military coups]{.mark}.]{.underline}** U.S. training programs frequently
bought by other nations, most notably International Military Education
and Training (IMET), gave formal training to the leaders of the 2009
Honduran coup, the 2012 Mali coup, and the 2013 Egyptian
coup.[97](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor097)
[In these cases, the training that was supposed to stabilize the country
provided military leaders with the tools to overthrow the government
they were meant to support.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales have no effect on national security

To develop our argument we begin in section one with a quantitative
analysis of U.S. arms sales since 9/11 in order to illustrate the
dangerous track record of recent sales. We then provide a brief history
of U.S. arms sales policy to provide a context for the current process
in section two. Section three outlines the advocates' case for arms
sales and section four outlines the case against. We conclude with a
brief discussion of the current politics of the arms trade and a series
of policy recommendations. Under the right circumstances, we agree that
arms sales can be a useful tool of foreign policy. More often, however,
[we argue that the benefits of U.S. arms sales are too uncertain and too
limited to outweigh the negative consequences they often
produce.]{.underline} Though presidents like them because they are
relatively easy to use, in most cases arms sales are not the best way to
achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives. The strategic case for radically
reducing arms sales rests on four related arguments. First, [[arms sales
do little to enhance American security]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, the
nonsecurity benefits are far more limited and uncertain than arms sales
advocates acknowledge. Third, [the negative and unwanted consequences of
arms sales are more common and more dangerous than most realize.
Finally, [the United States would enjoy significant diplomatic benefits
from halting arms sales.]{.mark} **Arms Sales Provide Little Direct
Benefit to U.S. National Security**]{.underline} At the strategic level,
**[[the United States inhabits such an extremely favorable security
environment]{.mark} in the post-Cold War world [that most arms sales do
little or nothing to improve its security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thanks
to its geography, friendly (and weak) neighbors, large and dynamic
economy, and secure nuclear arsenal, the United States faces very few
significant threats. There is no Soviet Union bent upon dominating
Europe and destroying the United States. China, despite its rapid rise,
cannot (and has no reason to) challenge the sovereignty or territorial
integrity of the United States. [[Arms sales]{.mark} --- to allies or
others --- [are unnecessary to deter major, direct threats to U.S.
national security]{.mark} in the current
era]{.underline}.[47](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor047)
Nor are arms sales necessary to protect the United States from "falling
dominoes," or the consequences of conflicts elsewhere. **[[The United
States enjoys]{.mark} what Eric Nordlinger called "[strategic
immunity.]{.mark}"[48](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor048)
Simply put, [most of what happens in the rest of the world is irrelevant
to U.S. national security.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The United States has
spent decades helping South Korea keep North Korea in check, for
example, but division of territory on the Korean peninsula does not
affect America's security[. Likewise, civil wars in the Middle East and
Russia's annexation of Crimea might be significant for many reasons, but
those events do not threaten the ability of the United States to defend
itself. As a result, a decision to sell weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan, or
South Korea could significantly affect those nations' security; doing so
is not an act of ensuring U.S. national security.]{.underline}

#### The US has near zero ability to influence foreign strategy as a result of arms deals and US hegemonic dominance overall is already severely diminished 

Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3-13-20**18**, Thrall is a
senior fellow for the Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy
Department. Thrall is also an associate professor at George Mason
University's, Dorminey was a policy analyst in defense and foreign

https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
MJD

There is also good reason to believe that [several factors are making
the promotion of regional stability through arms sales more difficult.
The shrinking U.S. military advantage over other powers such as China
and the increasingly competitive global arms market both make it less
likely that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference]{.underline}.
As William Hartung argued as early as 1990, "the notion of using arms
transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated regional balance of power
seems increasingly archaic in today's arms market, in which a potential
U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies
like Italy or France as it is from former or current
adversaries."[58](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor058)
In sum, **[the academic and historical evidence indicates that although
the United States can use arms sales to enhance the military
capabilities of other nations and thereby shift the local and regional
balance of power, its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such
efforts is severely limited]{.underline}**. Arms for (Not That Much)
Influence[. Successful foreign policy involves encouraging other nations
to behave in ways that benefit the United States. As noted, the United
States has often attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of
leverage or influence necessary to do this. History reveals, however,
that the benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two
main reasons.]{.underline} First, **[[the range of cases in which arms
sales can produce useful leverage is]{.mark} much [narrow]{.mark}er than
is often imagined]{.underline}**. Most obviously, arms sales are
unnecessary in situations where the other country already agrees or
complies with the American position or can be encouraged to do so
without such incentives. This category includes most U.S. allies and
close partners under many, though not all, circumstances. Just as
clearly, [the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when the other
state will never agree to comply with American demands]{.underline}.
This category includes a small group of obvious cases such as Russia,
China, Iran, and other potential adversaries (to which the United States
does not sell weapons anyway), but it also includes a much larger group
of cases in which the other state opposes what the United States wants,
or in which complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too
dangerous for that state's
leadership.[59](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor059)
In addition, [there are some cases in which the United States itself
would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool]{.underline}. The Leahy
Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security
assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for
past human rights
abuses.[60](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor060)
More broadly, arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient
state is a failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or
interstate war. Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear whether there
is anyone to negotiate with in the first place, and governments are at
best on shaky ground. At present the United States bars 17 such nations
from purchasing American arms. As long as these nations are embargoed,
arms sales will remain an irrelevant option for exerting
influence.[61](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor061)
[Apart from these cases, there is a large group of nations with tiny
defense budgets that simply don't buy enough major conventional weaponry
to provide much incentive for arms sales]{.underline}. On this list are
as many as 112 countries that purchased less than \$100 million in arms
from the United States between 2002 and 2016, including Venezuela,
Jamaica, and Sudan. Lest this category be dismissed because it includes
mostly smaller and less strategically significant countries from the
American perspective, it should be noted that each of these countries
has a vote in the United Nations (and other international organizations)
and that many of them suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making
them potential targets of interest for American policymakers looking for
international influence. [**By definition, then, [the arms-for-influence
strategy is limited to cases in which a currently noncompliant country
might be willing to change its policies]{.mark} (at least for the right
price or to avoid punishment).** [The second problem]{.mark} with the
arms for influence strategy [is that international pressure]{.mark} [in
general,]{.mark} whether in the form of economic sanctions, arms sales
and embargoes, or military and foreign aid promises and threats,
typically [has a very limited impact on state
behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline} Though again, on paper, the logic of both
coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, [research shows
that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the
national balance sheet.]{.underline} In particular, leaders tend to
respond far more to concerns about national security and their own
regime security than they do to external pressure**[. [Arms
sales,]{.mark} whether used as carrots or sticks, [are]{.mark} in effect
[a fairly weak version of economic sanctions, which research has shown
have limited effects]{.mark}, even when approved by the United Nations,
and tend to spawn a host of unintended consequences.]{.underline}** As
such, the expectations for their utility should be even more
limited.[62](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor062)
A recent study regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a
similar conclusion, noting that, "The economic impact of sanctions may
be pronounced ... but other factors in the situational context almost
always overshadow the impact of sanctions in determining the political
outcome."[63](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor063)The
authors of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur,
arguing that, "In general we find that military aid does not lead to
more cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With
limited exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a
significant reduction in cooperative foreign policy
behavior."[64](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor064)
Perhaps the most explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States
has had exerting this kind of leverage came during the Reagan
administration. Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of
many when he said, "Many countries to whom we dispense aid continue to
thumb their noses at us" at the United Nations, and Congress passed
legislation authorizing the president to limit aid to any state that
repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at the
UN.[65](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor065)
In 1986, the Reagan administration began to monitor voting patterns and
issue threats, and, in roughly 20 cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the
amount of aid sent to nations the administration felt were not
deferential enough. An analysis of the results, however, found no
linkage between changes in American support and UN voting patterns by
recipient states. The authors' conclusion fits neatly within the broader
literature about the limited impact of sanctions: "The resilience of aid
recipients clearly demonstrates that their policies were driven more
powerfully by interests other than the economic threat of a
hegemon."[66](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor066)
[[The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms
sales]{.mark} specifically [is quite mixed]{.mark}.]{.underline} U.S.
arms sales may have improved Israeli security over the years, for
example, but American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a
durable peace settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact.
**[Nor have arms sales provided the United States with enough leverage
over the years to prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey,
Indonesia, and Morocco from invading their neighbors.]{.underline}**
[Nor have arms sales helped restrain the human rights abuses of clients
like Chile or Libya, or various Middle Eastern client
states]{.underline}. **[Although the United States has used the promise
of arms sales or the threat of denying arms successfully from time to
time, [the failures outnumber the victories]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
most rigorous study conducted to tease out the conditions under which
arms for influence efforts are successful is a 1994 study by John
Sislin.[67](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor067)
Collating 191 attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin codes 80 of those
attempts (42 percent) successful. Sislin's analysis is incomplete,
however, since he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and
does not consider the long-term consequences. Furthermore, [a close look
at the supposedly successful attempts reveals that many of them are
cases in which the United States is in fact simply buying something
rather than actually "influencing" another nation.]{.underline} Thirty
of the cases Sislin coded as successful were instances of the United
States using arms to buy access to military bases (20 cases) or to raw
materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries to buy more American
weapons (5
cases).[68](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor068)
Without those in the dataset, [the U.S. success rate drops to 31
percent.]{.underline} Finally, **[[the conditions for successful
leverage seeking appear to be deteriorating]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
First, Sislin's study found that [American influence was at its height
during the Cold War when American power overshadowed the rest of the
world. [With the leveling out of the global distribution of
power,]{.mark} both economic and military, [the ability of the United
States to exert influence has waned, regardless of the specific tool
being used]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, as noted above, **[[the U.S.
share of the global arms market has declined as the industry has become
more competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats carry
less weight than before]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As William Hartung
noted, "The odds \[of\] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are
incalculably higher \[worse\] in a world in which there are dozens of
nations to turn to in shopping for major combat
equipment."[69](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor069)

#### Arms Sales have no positive effect on the fight against terrorism abroad

[[Nor does the threat of transnational terrorism justify most arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most fundamentally, the actual threat from
Islamist-inspired terrorism to Americans is extraordinarily low. Since
9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic State has managed an attack on
the American homeland. Lone wolf terrorists inspired by those groups
have done so, but since 9/11 those attacks have killed fewer than 100
Americans, an average of about 6 people per year. There is simply very
little risk reduction to be gained from any strategy. The idea that the
United States should be willing to accept the significant negative
effects of arms sales for minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously
misguided.[49](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor049)
Moreover, even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the
potential costs, arms sales still have almost no value as a tool in the
war on terror for several reasons. First, [[the bulk of arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark} (and those we considered in our risk
assessment) [[involve major conventional weapons, which are ill suited
to combatting terrorism.]{.underline}]{.mark} Many U.S. arms deals since
9/11 have involved major conventional weapons systems such as fighter
jets, missiles, and artillery, useful for traditional military
operations, but of little use in fighting terrorists. Insurgencies that
hold territory, like the Islamic State, are one thing, but most
terrorist groups do not advertise their location, nor do they assemble
in large groups. Second, there is little evidence from the past 16 years
that direct military intervention is the right way to combat terrorism.
Research reveals that military force alone "seldom ends
terrorism."[50](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor050)
This comports with the American experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and
elsewhere in the war on terror to date. Despite regime change, thousands
of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the military capabilities of
friendly governments, the United States has not only failed to destroy
the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has also spawned chaos,
greater resentment, and a sharp increase in the level of terrorism
afflicting the nations
involved.[51](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor051)
Given the experience of the United States since 2001, [[there is little
reason to expect that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce
terrorism, much less anti-American terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}
specifically. Relatedly, many arms deals since 9/11, made in the name of
counterterrorism, were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on
terror because they provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist
groups only vaguely (if at all) linked to al Qaeda or ISIS. Although
selling weapons to the governments of Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia
might help them combat violent resistance in their countries, terrorist
groups in those countries have never targeted the United States. As a
result, such arms deals cannot be justified by arguing that they advance
the goals of the United States in its own war on terror in any serious
way. Finally, arms sales are completely useless to combat the largest
terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland --- lone wolf attackers already
living in the United States. As noted, none of the successful attacks in
the United States since 9/11 resulted from operations directed by al
Qaeda or ISIS. And in fact only two foiled attempts since then --- the
underwear bomber and the printer-bomb plot --- can be ascribed to al
Qaeda.[52](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor052)
Instead, in almost all cases, persons already living in the United
States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to carry out attacks on
their own. Clearly, arms sales to foreign nations won't help with that
problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested, amplifying conflicts
abroad may well make the problem
worse.[53](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor053)
In sum, the strategic value of arms sales for the United States is very
low given today's security environment. Different circumstances would
produce a different analysis. Although today there is little reason for
the United States to worry about the Russian threat to Europe, during
the Cold War foreign policy experts agreed that preventing the Soviet
Union from dominating the European continent was critical to American
security. As a result, the United States sensibly provided NATO allies
with advanced weapons. This strategy greatly enhanced the fighting
capability of NATO, thereby bolstering deterrence and ensuring European
security. Today, happily, the United States faces no such threats. For
this reason, [[the argument in favor of arms sales cannot rest on
national security grounds but must rest instead on "national interest"
grounds]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, on the benefits gained from
helping other nations improve their own security, and from maintaining
conditions generally believed to be in the national interest, such as
regional stability or the prevention of war. This is already a much
weaker position than the conventional wisdom acknowledges. Even worse
for such sales' advocates, however, is the fact that arms sales are
notoriously uncertain tools for achieving those objectives.

#### US defense industry is not at all dependent on Saudi Arabian arms purchases

On Wednesday a bipartisan group of lawmakers
[introduced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-arms-congress/u-s-lawmakers-consider-bill-to-ban-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-idUSKCN1MY2RN)
a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives that would stop most U.S.
arms sales to the kingdom, specifically referencing "the murder of
journalist and United States permanent resident Jamal Khashoggi."
Raytheon faces political headwinds over a proposed sale of
precision-guided bomb kits, complex navigation systems that steer bombs
to their targets, presumably making them more effective against military
targets and less dangerous for civilians. Raytheon wants to sell bomb
kits to the United Arab Emirates as well as Saudi Arabia, but the Saudi
portion of that deal is being held up by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)
over human rights concerns. Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the ranking Democrat
on the Armed Services Committee, recently told reporters that he
wouldn't support any new weapons deals to the kingdom. ["The mood of the
Congress is this outrageous act can't be followed by a business as usual
arms deal,"]{.underline} he said, according to published reports.
**[Still, [defense analysts believe U.S. defense contractors are
unlikely to take much of a financial hit over the Saudi situation, even
if arms sales are curbed significantly]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [With the
U.S. defense budget growing again under a Republican-controlled Congress
and White House, companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are more
optimistic about future sales in the United States. "[We are a global
company providing technology and security solutions for over 80
countries and we have numerous global franchises]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Raytheon chief executive Thomas Kennedy said. ["So I'm pretty confident
that we will weather this complexity.\"]{.underline} [**[Lockheed took
in more than \$50 billion from U.S. government contracts last year,
dwarfing its expected \$500 million in Saudi sales for
2019.]{.underline}** "[So not a huge amount of dependency on the
\[Saudi\] activity]{.underline}]{.mark}[, even though the opportunities
we've described are much larger than that obviously,]{.underline}"
Lockheed chief financial officer Bruce Tanner said Tuesday. Defense
analysts see it as unlikely that any campaign to limit arms sales will
succeed unless President Trump leaves the White House in 2020. Even
then, U.S. defense contractors would have the support of a sophisticated
and well-funded lobbying operation in Washington: Lockheed Martin,
Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon spent more than \$50 million
combined in 2017, according to
[opensecrets.org](http://opensecrets.org/). Boeing, which has a
substantial commercial airline business, led the way with \$16.7
million, with Lockheed and Northrop at \$14.5 million each. "We have
supported the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in securing defense for more than
50 years," Kennedy said. "And through that course of time, we have seen
issues that have occurred at different periods of uncertainty. And we've
always resolved it through the end and by doing this one thing: It's
actually following the direction and position of the U.S.
administration, which we were right behind in making sure that we
understand where they are going and that we're locked in step behind
them."

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia do not provide any strategic benefit to US defense contractors and do not deescalate tensions with Iran

Michael **Laforgia and** Walt **Bogdanich, 6-7**-2019, "Trump Allows
High-Tech U.S. Bomb Parts to Be Built in Saudi Arabia", The New York
Times, 6-14-2019,

MJD

WASHINGTON --- When the Trump administration declared an emergency last
month and fast-tracked the sale of more American arms to Saudi Arabia,
it did more than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on
humanitarian grounds. It also raised concerns that the Saudis could gain
access to technology that would let them produce their own versions of
American precision-guided bombs --- weapons they have used in strikes on
civilians since they began fighting [a war in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/middleeast/saudi-yemen-airstrikes-civilians.html?module=inline)
four years ago. [The [emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/middleeast/trump-troop-increase-middle-east-iran.html?module=inline)
allows Raytheon Company, a top American defense firm, to team with the
Saudis to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} [That
provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad
package of information the administration released this week to
Congress.]{.underline} The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping
permission to begin assembling the control systems, guidance electronics
and circuit cards that are essential to the company's Paveway smart
bombs. [The United States has closely guarded such technology for
national security reasons.]{.underline} Multiple reports by human rights
groups over the past four years have singled out the weapons as being
used in airstrikes on civilians. One attack, on a Sana funeral home in
October 2016, led the Obama administration to suspend bomb sales to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The new arrangement is part of a larger
arms package, previously blocked by Congress, that includes 120,000
precision-guided bombs that Raytheon is prepared to ship to the
coalition. [[These will add to the tens of thousands of bombs that Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have already stockpiled]{.mark}, and
some in Congress fear the surplus would let the countries continue
fighting in Yemen long into the future. T]{.underline}he move also
includes support for Saudi F-15 warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles
and .50-caliber rifles. The emergency declaration, invoked in part
because of tensions with Iran, prompted a broad bipartisan pushback from
lawmakers who were concerned not only about the war, but also about
whether the Trump administration was usurping congressional authority to
approve arms sales. A group of senators that includes Lindsey Graham,
the South Carolina Republican, Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, and
Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat, announced on Wednesday that
they would introduce [22 separate
measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/senate-trump-saudi-arabia.html?module=inline)
expressing disapproval of the deals. "[Few nations should be trusted
less than Saudi Arabia,"]{.underline} Mr. Paul said in a statement on
Thursday. ["In recent years, they have fomented human atrocities,
repeatedly lied to the United States and have proved to be a reckless
regional pariah. It is concerning and irresponsible for the United
States to continue providing them arms]{.underline}." In the House, the
Foreign Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing for next week in which
members plan to question R. Clarke Cooper, the State Department official
whose bureau licenses arms exports. "[The Saudis and Emiratis have
become so intertwined with the Trump administration that I don't think
the president is capable of distinguishing America's national interests
from theirs,"]{.underline} said Representative Tom Malinowski, a New
Jersey Democrat who sits on the committee. "**[The administration has
presented us [no evidence that Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. face any
substantially new or intensified threat from Iran that would justify
declaring an emergency."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Mr. Malinowski, a top
human rights official under President Obama, said the bombs were for use
in Yemen, not for defending the Saudi or Emirati homeland from Iran, as
some Trump administration officials have suggested. The White House did
not respond to a request for comment. A Raytheon spokesman said there
was nothing unusual about the production arrangement. "Industrial
participation by local partners has been an element of international
sales of military equipment for decades," said the spokesman, Mike
Doble. "These activities and related technologies are governed by the
Arms Export Control Act, controlled by the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, and conform to all licensing rules and restrictions of the
United States government." [Defense contractors have established close
ties with the Trump administration, and key executives from several
companies, including Raytheon, have made their way into high-ranking
positions]{.underline}. Raytheon's former vice president for government
relations, Mark T. Esper, was confirmed as Army secretary in 2017. The
defense firm has also cultivated ties to the Saudi government. During
President Trump's visit to the kingdom in May 2017, [[Raytheon signed an
agreement to work more closely with the Saudi Arabian Military
Industries Company]{.mark}, a holding company owned by the country's
sovereign wealth fund.]{.underline} It was unclear whether the new
production deal fell under that plan. The production agreement took some
lawmakers by surprise. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat
and an outspoken critic of the Yemen war, said it seemed "to serve no
purpose other than to forfeit our technology and prevent future
congressional oversight[." **[The arrangement]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,
which would effectively outsource jobs, [appears to be at odds
with]{.mark} Mr. [Trump's position that arms sales are important because
of the American jobs they create]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Rob
Berschinski, a senior vice president at Human Rights First, an advocacy
group, said the administration's decision was "about siding unreservedly
with favored Middle Eastern authoritarians, no matter who they kill or
how they repress their citizens." Mr. Berschinski, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state, added, "It has nothing to do with American
jobs." Congress had been informally blocking the sale of the smart bombs
at least since May last year, when Mr. Menendez and Representative Eliot
L. Engel, the New York Democrat, expressed concerns over how the Saudis
were using the weapons in Yemen. Opposition intensified after American
intelligence officials concluded that the Saudi government played a role
in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and columnist for
The Washington Post. But then, last month, on the Friday before Memorial
Day weekend, Mr. Trump took the rare step of declaring an emergency to
push these weapons out the door. In a May 24 letter, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo notified congressional leaders of the emergency declaration,
waiving congressional review of the weapon sales. Mr. Pompeo said he
took into account "political, military, economic, human rights and arms
control considerations." The State Department on Monday disclosed more
details to Congress, including the nature of the arms sales. "**[If
Saudi Arabia is able to develop an indigenous bomb-making capability as
a result of this deal, it will undermine U.S. leverage to prevent them
from engaging in indiscriminate strikes of the kind it has carried out
in Yemen,"]{.underline}** said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a think
tank. [The authorization paperwork signed by Mr. Pompeo offers no
timeline for the shared operations to get underway, and Raytheon
representatives have said they are still negotiating over details with
the Saudi government, according to a congressional aide. Aside from
potentially providing the Saudis with more bombs to use in Yemen
airstrikes, [the arrangement raised security concerns]{.mark} among
lawmakers, who were seeking assurances [that the Saudis could prevent
the American technology from falling into the wrong
hands]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Both Republicans and Democrats also
noted that it called for creating manufacturing jobs in Saudi Arabia
that might otherwise have been located in the United States. [[And they
expressed worry that the Saudis might eventually copy the technology and
use it to produce their own weapons, which they would be free to use in
Yemen or sell to whomever they chose.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Saudis
have been carrying out regular airstrikes in Yemen since March 2015,
when Houthi rebels overthrew the Saudi-backed government. The war has
created what the United Nations has called the world's worst
humanitarian crisis, pushing millions to the edge of starvation and
leading to the spread of cholera and the deaths of thousands of
civilians.

In this essay I look at the evolving encounters between rising states
and the post-war Western international order. My starting point is the
classic "power transition" perspective[. Power transition theories see a
tight link between international order---]{.underline}its emergence,
stability, and decline---[and the rise and fall of great
powers.]{.underline} It is a perspective that sees history as a sequence
of cycles in which powerful or hegemonic states rise up and build order
and dominate the global system until their power declines, leading to a
new cycle of crisis and order building. In contrast, I offer a more
evolutionary perspective, emphasizing the lineages and continuities in
modern international order. More specifically, I argue that
[[although]{.mark} America's [heg]{.mark}emonic position [may be
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the liberal international
characteristics of order]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[---openness, rules,
multilateral cooperation---[are deeply rooted and likely to
persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [This is true [ev**en though**]{.mark}
**the orientation and actions of the [Trump]{.mark} administration**
have [raised]{.mark} serious [questions]{.mark} about the U.S.
commitment to liberal internationalism. Just as importantly, [rising
states]{.mark} (led by **China**) **[are not engaged in a frontal
attack]{.mark}** on the American-led order.]{.underline} [While
struggles do exist over orientations, agendas, and leadership, **the
non-Western developing countries remain tied** to the architecture and
principles of a liberal-oriented global orde]{.underline}r. And [even as
China seeks in various ways to build rival regional institutions,
**there are stubborn limits on what it can do.**]{.underline} Power
Transitions and International Order There is wide agreement that the
world is witnessing a long-term global power transition. [Wealth and
power is diffusing, spreading outward and away from Europe and the
United States.]{.underline} [The rapid growth that marked the
non-Western rising states in the last decade may have ended, and even
China's rapid economic ascendency has slowed]{.underline}. But [the
overall pattern of change remains: the "rest" are gaining ground on the
"West."]{.underline} While there is wide agreement that the world is
witnessing a global power transition, there is less agreement on the
consequences of power shifts for international order. The classic view
is advanced by realist scholars, such as E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Paul
Kennedy, and William Wohlforth, who make sweeping arguments about power
and order. These [hegemonic realists argue that international order is
a by-product of the concentration of power]{.underline}. Order is
created by a powerful state, and when that state declines and power
diffuses, international order weakens or breaks apart. Out of these
dynamic circumstances, a rising state emerges as the new dominant state,
and it seeks to reorganize the international system to suit its own
purposes. In this view, world politics from ancient times to the modern
era can be seen as a series of repeated cycles of rise and decline. War,
protectionism, depression, political upheaval---various sorts of crises
and disruptions may push the cycle forward. This narrative of hegemonic
rise and decline draws on the European and, more broadly, Western
experience. Since the early modern era, Europe has been organized and
reorganized by a succession of leading states and would-be hegemons: the
Spanish Hapsburgs, France of Louis XIV and Napoleon, and post-Bismarck
Germany. [The logic of hegemonic order comes even more clearly into view
with Pax Britannica]{.underline}, the nineteenth-century hegemonic order
based on British naval and mercantile dominance. The decline of Britain
was followed by decades of war and economic instability, which ended
only with the rise of Pax Americana. [For hegemonic realists, the debate
today is about where the world is along this cyclical pathway of rise
and decline. Has the United States finally lost the ability or
willingness to underwrite and lead the post-war order?]{.underline} Are
we in the midst of a hegemonic crisis and the breakdown of the old
order? And are rising states, led by China, beginning to step forward in
efforts to establish their own hegemonic dominance of their regions and
the world? These are the lurking questions of the power transition
perspective. **[But does this vision of power transition truly
illuminate the struggles going on today over international
order?]{.underline}** [Some might argue no---that the United States is
still in a position, despite its travails, to provide hegemonic
leadership]{.underline}. Here one would note that [there is a durable
infrastructure (or what Susan Strange has called "structural power")
that undergirds the existing American-led order]{.underline}.
[Far-flung security alliances, market relations, liberal democratic
solidarity, deeply rooted geopolitical alignments---there are many
possible sources of American hegemonic power that remain
intact]{.underline}. **[But [there may]{.mark} [be]{.mark} even
[deeper]{.mark} sources of [continuity]{.mark} in the existing
system.]{.underline}** This would be true if the existence of a
liberal-oriented international order does not in fact require hegemonic
domination. It might be that the **[[power transition theory is wrong:
the stability and persistence of the existing]{.mark} post-war
international [order does not depend on]{.mark} the concentration of
[American power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In fact, [international order is
not simply an artifact of concentrations of power]{.underline}. The
**[[rules and institutions]{.mark} that make up international order
[have a more complex and contingent relationship]{.mark} with the rise
and fall of state power]{.underline}**. This is true in two respects.
First, [international order itself is complex: multilayered,
multifaceted, and not simply a political formation imposed by the
leading state]{.underline}. [International order is not "one thing" that
states either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of
ordering rules and institutions]{.underline}. **[There are the deep
rules and norms of sovereignty. There are [governing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, starting with the United Nations.
**[There is a sprawling array of international institutions,
[regimes]{.mark}, treaties, agreements, protocols, [and so
forth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These governing arrangements cut across
diverse realms, including security and arms control, the world economy,
the environment and global commons, human rights, and political
relations. [Some of these domains of governance may have rules and
institutions that narrowly reflect the interests of the hegemonic state,
but most reflect negotiated outcomes based on a much broader set of
interests. As rising states continue to rise]{.underline}, they do not
simply confront an American-led order; [they face a wider conglomeration
of ordering rules, institutions, and arrangements; many of which they
have long embraced**. By [separat]{.mark}ing "American
[hegemony]{.mark}" [from]{.mark} "the existing international order," we
can see a more complex set of [relationships]{.mark}.** The United
States **does not embody the international order;** it has a
relationship with it, as do rising states]{.underline}. [The United
States embraces many of the core global rules and
institutions]{.underline}, such as the United Nations, International
Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. [But it
also has resisted ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (it being the only country not to
have ratified the latter) as well as various arms control and
disarmament agreements.]{.underline} [China also embraces many of the
same global rules and institutions, and resists ratification of
others]{.underline}. Generally speaking, the more fundamental or core
the norms and institutions are---beginning with the Westphalian norms of
sovereignty and the United Nations system---the more agreement there is
between the United States and China as well as other states.
Disagreements are most salient where human rights and political
principles are in play, such as in the Responsibility to Protect.
[Second, there is also diversity in what rising states "want" from the
international order. T]{.underline}he struggles over international order
take many different forms. In some instances, what rising states want is
more influence and control of territory and geopolitical space beyond
their borders. One can see this in China's efforts to expand its
maritime and political influence in the South China Sea and other
neighboring areas. This is an age-old type of struggle captured in
realist accounts of security competition and geopolitical rivalry.
Another type of struggle is over the norms and values that are enshrined
in global governance rules and institutions. These may be about how open
and rule-based the system should be. They may also be about the way
human rights and political principles are defined and brought to bear in
relations among states. Finally, the struggles over international order
may be focused on the distribution of authority. That is, rising states
may seek a greater role in the governance of existing institutions. This
is a struggle over the position of states within the global political
hierarchy: voting shares, leadership rights, and authority relations.
[These observations cut against the realist hegemonic perspective and
cyclical theories of power transition]{.underline}. **[Rising states do
not confront a single, coherent, hegemonic order.]{.underline}** [The
international order offers a buffet of options and choices. They can
embrace some rules and institutions and not others]{.underline}.
Moreover, stepping back, [the international orders that rising states
have faced in different historical eras have not all been the same
order]{.underline}. The British-led order that Germany faced at the turn
of the twentieth century is different from the international order that
China faces today. [The contemporary international order is much more
complex and wide-ranging than past orders]{.underline}. **[It has a much
denser array of rules, institutions, and governance
realms]{.underline}**. There are also both regional and global domains
of governance. **[This makes it hard to imagine an epic moment when the
international order goes into crisis and rising states step
forward---either China alone or rising states as a bloc---to reorganize
and reshape its rules and institutions]{.underline}**. Rather than a
cyclical dynamic of rise and decline, [change in the existing
American-led order might best be captured by terms such as continuity,
evolution, adaptation, and negotiation. **The struggles over
international order today are growing, but it is not a drama best told
in terms of the rise and decline of American hegemony.**]{.underline}

#### Structural factors make hegemonic collapse inevitable and peaceful

Transnational Challenges and Governance, Chair of its ASEAN Studies
Initiative. *The End of American World Order: Second Edition*. Polity
Press, Medford MA. Accessed via iBooks.)

In this new edition, I make the following arguments: [**1**. The
[global]{.mark} outpouring of [concerns surrounding Trump]{.mark}\'s
election as US President vindicate the book\'s analysis in 2014, that
the US-led liberal international order]{.underline} or the American
World Order (AWO) **[was in decline,]{.underline}** even if the US
itself was not. [**2.[Trump is the consequence, not the cause of the
decline]{.mark}** of the US-led liberal order.
**3.**]{.underline}Despite [[Trump]{.underline}\'s]{.mark} pledge to
make "America great again," he [[cannot reverse the decline]{.mark} of
the US-led world order. **4. [The global power shift from the West to
the Rest continues]{.mark}** despite recent economic slowdown and
political crisis in several BRICS nations. **5.**]{.underline} [While
[the liberal order is imploding in the West, China and India are likely
to pursue globalization]{.mark},]{.underline} albeit in a way different
from the earlier Western-led globalization. China in particular is
taking on a more assertive role in reshaping globalization and global
governance. [**6**. The architecture of global cooperation developed
under the liberal order is **fracturing** and regionalism in Europe is
facing a moment of crisis with Brexit]{.underline}, but [[**new forms of
international cooperation are emerging**,]{.mark} such as China\'s Belt
and Road Initiative.]{.underline} [**7. [While there are signs of
growing conflict and violence in the world, these are not necessarily
due to the decline of the American World Order]{.mark}**. Many of the
sources of violence are not new, and some are directly the result of
policy choices made by Western powers led by the US]{.underline} (Iraq,
Libya, and Syria). Some global challenges such as terrorism are actually
highly localized, and [there are long-term and newer sources of
stability in the world that can be further developed through renewed
cooperation and shared leadership with the emerging
powers.\"]{.underline} [A multiplex world will not be free from
conflicts and disorder]{.underline}. But absolute peace is illusory. The
goal should be to achieve relative stability, preventing major power
wars and genocide and managing regional conflicts to minimize human
suffering. [[Just because the West is losing its hegemony **does not
mean the world is doomed to chaos**]{.mark}**,** without leadership or
cooperation]{.underline}. [The nature of leadership is changing. A
multiplex world presents both challenges and opportunities for global
and regional cooperation.]{.underline} This would require the Western
nations to shed their free-riding on the US and accept shared leadership
with the rising and regional powers. It would require greater
partnership between global and regional bodies, public, private and
civil-society groups. This is a G-Plus World and requires a reformed
system of global governance that accords genuine recognition to the
voices and aspirations of the Rest. [America and its Western allies must
give up exclusive privileges in return for their trust and cooperation
in order to make the system work.]{.underline} If this is the view of an
optimist, then let me be one.

#### No hegemony impact\-\--empirics and political psychology prove US posture is unrelated to great power peace

Christopher **Fettweis 17**, associate professor of political science at
Tulane University. 5/8/17, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace"
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394?needAccess=true

[After three years in the White House, Ronald Reagan had learned
something surprising: "Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy
were genuinely afraid of America and Americans]{.underline}," he wrote
in his autobiography. He continued: "Perhaps this shouldn't have
surprised me, but it did ... I'd always felt that from our deeds it must
be clear to anyone that Americans were a moral people who starting at
the birth of our nation had always used our power only as a force for
good in the world.... [During my first years in Washington, I think many
of us took it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered
it unthinkable that the United States would launch a first strike
against them]{.underline}." [100 Reagan is certainly not alone in
believing in the essential benevolent image of his nation. While it is
common for actors to attribute negative motivations to the behavior of
others, it is **exceedingly difficult** for them to accept that anyone
could interpret their actions in negative ways. Leaders are well aware
of their own motives and tend to assume that their peaceful intentions
are obvious and transparent]{.underline}. [Both strains of the
[heg]{.mark}emonic-[stability]{.mark} explanation [assume]{.mark} not
only that [US power is benevolent]{.mark}, but [that]{.mark} [others
**perceive** it that way.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Heg]{.mark}emonic
stability [depends on]{.mark} the [perceptions of other states]{.mark}
to be successful; **[it has no hope]{.mark}** to succeed [if it
encounters resistance]{.mark} from the less powerful members of the
system, or even if they simply refuse to follow the rules]{.underline}.
[Relatively small police forces require the general cooperation of large
communities to have any chance of establishing order.]{.underline} [They
must perceive the sheriff as just, rational, and essentially
nonthreatening.]{.underline} The lack of balancing behavior in the
system, which has been puzzling to many realists, seems to support the
notion of widespread perceptions of benevolent hegemony.101 Were they
threatened by the order constructed by the United States, the argument
goes, smaller states would react in ways that reflected their fears.
Since internal and external balancing accompanied previous attempts to
achieve hegemony, the absence of such behavior today suggests that
something is different about the US version. [Hegemonic-stability
theorists purport to understand the perceptions of others, at times
better than those others understand themselves]{.underline}. Complain as
they may at times, other countries know that the United States is acting
in the common interest. Objections to unipolarity, though widespread,
are not "very seriously intended," wrote Kagan, since "the truth about
America's dominant role in the world is known to most observers. And the
truth is that the benevolent hegemony exercised by the United States is
good for a vast portion of the world's population." 102 [In the 1990s,
[Russian protests regarding NATO]{.mark} expansion---though nearly
universal---[were not taken seriously]{.mark}, since US planners
believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all.]{.underline} Sagacious Russians understood that expansion would
actually be beneficial, since it would bring stability to their western
border.103 [President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher
were caught off guard by the hostility of their counterparts regarding
the issue at a summit in Budapest in December 1994]{.underline}.104
[[Despite warnings from]{.mark} the vast majority of academic and policy
[experts about the]{.mark} likely [Russian reaction]{.mark} and overall
wisdom of expansion itself, the administration failed to anticipate
Moscow's position.]{.underline}105 [The Russians did not seem to believe
American assurances that expansion would actually be good for them.
**The United States overestimated the degree to which others saw it as
benevolent.** Once again, the culture of the United States might make
its leaders more vulnerable to this misperception. The need for
[positive self-regard appears]{.mark} to be particularly [strong in
North America]{.mark}n societies]{.underline} compared to elsewhere.106
[Western egos tend to be gratified through self-promotion rather than
humility, and independence rather than interdependence]{.underline}.
[Americans are more likely to feel good if they are unique rather than a
good cog in society's wheel, and uniquely good. The need to be perceived
as benevolent]{.underline}, though universal, may well exert stronger
encouragement for US observers to project their perceptions onto others.
[[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates almost certainly [frightens
others more than]{.mark} its [leaders perceive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A
quarter of the 68,000 respondents to a 2013 Gallup poll in sixty-five
countries identified the United States as the "greatest threat to world
peace," which was more than three times the total for the second-place
country]{.underline} (Pakistan).107 [The international community always
has to worry about the potential for police brutality, even if it occurs
rarely]{.underline}. Such ungratefulness tends to come as a surprise to
US leaders. In 2003, Condoleezza Rice was dismayed to discover
resistance to US initiatives in Iraq: "There were times," she said
later, "that it appeared that American power was seen to be more
dangerous than, perhaps, Saddam Hussein." 108 Both liberals and
neoconservatives probably exaggerate the extent to which US hegemony is
everywhere secretly welcomed[; it is not just petulant resentment, but
understandable [disagreement with]{.mark} US [policies]{.mark}, that
[motivates]{.mark} **[counterhegemonic]{.mark} beliefs and
[behavior]{.mark}**. To review, assuming for a moment that US
[leaders]{.mark} are subject to **the same forces that affect every
human being**, they **[overestimate]{.mark}** the amount of [control
they have]{.mark} over other actors]{.underline}, [and are not as
important to decisions made elsewhere as they believe themselves to be.
And they probably perceive their own benevolence to be much greater than
do others.]{.underline} [These common phenomena all influence US beliefs
in the same direction, and may well increase the apparent explanatory
power of hegemony beyond what the facts would otherwise
support.]{.underline} [The **U**nited **S**tates is probably not as
central to the New Peace as either liberals or neoconservatives
believe.]{.underline} In the end, what can be said about the
relationship between US power and international stability? Probably not
much that will satisfy partisans, and the pacifying virtue of US
hegemony will remain largely an article of faith in some circles in the
policy world. Like most beliefs, it will remain immune to alteration by
logic and evidence. Beliefs rarely change, so debates rarely end. For
those not yet fully converted, however, [perhaps it will be significant
that corroborating evidence for the relationship is extremely hard to
identify. If indeed hegemonic stability exists, it does so without
leaving much of a trace.]{.underline} [[Neither Washington's
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor its [interventions,
[nor]{.mark}]{.underline} its overall [[grand strategy]{.mark} seem
to]{.underline} [[matter]{.mark} much [to]{.mark} the [levels of armed
conflict]{.mark} around the world]{.underline} (apart from those wars
that Uncle Sam starts). [[The **empirical record** does not
contain]{.mark} strong [reasons to believe]{.mark} that [unipolarity
and]{.mark} the New [Peace are related]{.mark}, and [insights from
**political psychology** suggest]{.mark} that [heg]{.mark}emonic
stability [is]{.mark} a belief particularly [susceptible to
misperception]{.mark}]{.underline}. US leaders probably exaggerate the
degree to which their power matters, and could retrench without much
risk to themselves or the world around them. [Researchers will need to
look elsewhere to explain why the world has entered into the most
peaceful period in its history.]{.underline} The good news from this is
that [[the New Peace will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably
[[persist]{.underline}]{.mark} for quite some time, [[no matter how
dominant the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is, **or what
policies**]{.mark} **President [Trump follows]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or
how much resentment its actions cause in the periphery. [The people of
the twenty-first century are likely to be much safer and more secure
than any of their predecessors, even if many of them do not always
believe it.]{.underline}

[[The postwar liberal international order]{.mark} (LIO) [has been a
largely US creation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Washington's consensus,
geopolitically bound to the western 'core' during the Cold War, went
global with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the advent of
systemic unipolarity. Many criticisms can be levelled at US leadership
of the LIO, not least in respect of its claim to moral superiority,
albeit based on laudable norms such as human rights and democracy. For
often cynical reasons the US backed authoritarian regimes throughout the
Cold War, pursued disastrous forms of regime change after its end, and
has been deeply hostile to alternative (and often non-western)
civilizational orders that reject its dogmas. [[Its successes]{.mark},
however, [are manifold]{.mark}. Its 'empire by invitation' [has helped
secure a durable European peace, soften east Asian security dilemmas,
and underwrite the strategic preconditions for complex and pacifying
forms of global interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite tactical
differences between global political elites, a postwar commitment to
maintain the LIO, even in the context of deep structural shifts in
international relations, has remained resolute---until today. The
British vote to leave the EU (arguably as much a creation of the United
States as of its European members), has weakened one of the most
important institutions of the broader US-led LIO. [[More destabilizing
to the foundations]{.mark} of the LIO h[as been the election of
President Trump. His administration has actively encouraged the breakup
of the EU, questioned enduring US global security alliances such as
NATO, and seen the advocacy of an economic nationalism that threatens to
reverse globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 If the dominant cultural
paradigm of the early post-Cold War period was the end of history as a
triumphant liberal internationalism flattened global geopolitical space,
**[[Trump's victory represents the end of this
interregnum]{.underline}]{.mark}**: a rearticulation of the primacy of
the nation-state, a fracture in the postwar liberal internationalist
consensus and a hardening of geopolitical revisionism. Even if we
dismiss President Trump's statements as mere rhetoric, his capacity to
motivate millions to vote for him, as well as broader centrifugal
movements including Brexit, signal a weakening of the postwar liberal
consensus. In rejecting the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), seeking to
reverse the longstanding North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
and placing security partners on notice, [[**the United States is now
clearly asking why it should remain the world's hegemonic stabilizer if
the costs of maintaining that order far outweigh the benefits to
itself**.]{.underline}]{.mark} 'It's possible that we're going to have
to let NATO go,' Trump argued; when 'we're paying and nobody else is
really paying ... you feel like the jerk'.2 While it is undeniable that
the United States has had to underwrite a number of costly global
regimes, is Trump's portrait accurate? The question is an important one,
sitting at the heart of the administration's cost--benefit analysis as
it surveys the myriad American commitments across the globe, the
reversal of which will have profound and lasting implications for world
politics. In addressing that question, this article develops a number of
arguments. First, I sketch a nascent foreign policy world-view that we
see developing under Trump: an 'America First' bilateralism founded on
cost--benefit calculations. I then contrast this bilateralism with the
longstanding US postwar globalism that, I argue, saw the hard-wiring of
the American national interest into a systemsmaintaining role. [Given
the order maintenance costs of performing this role, why would the
United States choose]{.underline}

### ME Heg Impact D

#### US hegemony in the Middle East is already declining

Interests in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia and Iran", Future Directions

[Th[e United States has had a close relationship with the Middle
East]{.mark} region since the Second World War.]{.underline} Since it
was perceived as the main agent of the Allied victory in that war, many
Arab countries that had previously had strong affiliations with Great
Britain instead associated their primary interests, including their
security interests, with the US while continuing to have a strong
association with Great Britain. [The relationship worked well for a
while and was mutually beneficial. Washington sought to maintain a
stable environment in the region and developed strong relationships with
individual countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Persia, as well as the
smaller states]{.underline}. Poor administration, authoritarianism and
poor policy decisions on the part of several regional leaders, notably
the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, coupled with a perceived
willingness on the part of the US to ignore that state of affairs and
the suffering of the people, saw a change in the attitude of many people
in the region towards the US. The Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979 was
a watershed in Washington's relationship with the region as well as for
the region itself. The US was forced out of Iran, apart from a number of
Americans who were taken hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran, and
declared to be a "Great Satan" by Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah
Khomeini. The Islamic Revolution also created a schism between Iran and
other Shi'ite-majority countries in the region and the Sunni-majority
ones, led by Saudi Arabia. Since that time, neither situation has been
resolved. Analysis Since the 1950s, when the US developed an abiding
interest in the Middle East, the region has remained stable for
sustained periods, with brief interludes of conflict or political
change. That interest derived from the recognition in Washington that
influence over the Middle East's energy resources would assist it in
also influencing post-war reconstruction efforts in Europe and the
region and in its ideological competition with Communism. [Washington's
Middle East policies aimed to balance competing priorities while
emphasising a secure and stable environment]{.underline}. Some observers
and policymakers have argued that US interests in protecting the
political rights and improving the socio-economic conditions of the
inhabitants of the region are worthy aims only to the extent that they
do not interfere with other goals. This argument assumed that citizens
in many Arab states would not be swayed by US advocacy and assistance
and/or that those citizens had minimal opportunities to express dissent
in ways that could challenge their governments' co-operation with the
United States. Other analysts and US officials argued that [US
investments in the advancement of political rights and the development
of societies in the Middle East could serve as potential instruments of
strategic policy; in effect, a down payment on regional stability and a
safety valve against popular demands for swift or disruptive
change.]{.underline} This argument assumed that US engagement, advocacy,
and assistance could build a broad basis for bilateral co-operation
and/or that failure to respond to popular dissent or to disassociate the
United States from abuses by partner governments could produce a harmful
backlash. The latter approach rarely prevailed. The United States had
little interest in Middle Eastern oil or the region's geopolitics when,
in 1914, British soldiers landed at Basra, in southern Iraq, to protect
oil supplies from Persia; Washington's attention was then turned to
Latin America and East Asia. When Britain offered to share the spoils of
the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson
declined. During the Second World War, British, Soviet and US forces
were stationed in Iran to help transfer military supplies to the Soviet
Union and protect Iranian oil. Josef Stalin withdrew his troops after
the war only after President Truman protested their presence there.
Truman also strengthened ties with Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran,
and made Turkey a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, thus
turning the region into a potential front in the Cold War against the
Soviet Union. In 1953, Eisenhower ordered the CIA to depose Mohammad
Mossadegh, the elected leader of Iran, who opposed British and American
influence in his country. The coup tarnished the reputation of the US
among Iranians, who lost trust in its claim to be a protector of
democracy. That trust was further diminished by the growing perception
among Iranians that the US-backed Shah was little more than Washington's
puppet. That perception, coupled with his administration's rampant
corruption, eventually gave rise to theocratic rule in Iran. By then,
however, the US was well-integrated into the politics of the Middle
East. Washington also backed the House of Saud in Saudi Arabia, and the
regimes in Kuwait and Bahrain, where it stationed its naval Fifth Fleet
in 1995. Prior to that, Washington had developed extensive economic and
political links with those countries; centred, for the most part, on its
energy imports. By 2005, the US imported around 60 per cent of the oil
it consumed, most of that from the Middle East, which contains around 55
per cent of the world's known oil reserves. It also walked a fine line
in maintaining simultaneously its relations with both Israel and the
Arab states. **[The US made the security of Israel its top regional
priority, bringing that about through military aid, technology
transfers, diplomatic efforts aimed at either coercing Arab states into
accepting the fact of Israel's existence despite their public claims not
to do so, and by making Israel the military hegemon in the
region]{.underline}**. In so doing, however, it has polarised Arab
common opinion and, to a degree, furthered ideological radicalisation in
the region. That antipathy is further fuelled by Israel's ongoing threat
to wage war against Iran, no matter that Shi'ite-majority Iran is
disliked almost as intensely by the Arab street as the US. The regional
security ambitions of the US are conflated with those of Israel; it is
perceived, as a consequence, to encourage Israel to threaten war against
Iran, a war that no Arab state wants. Washington, therefore, finds
itself being uniformly disliked by Sunni and Shi'a alike. In a May 2011
address on US policy in the Middle East, then President Obama noted
that: **[[For decades, the United States has pursued a set of core
interests in the region:]{.mark} countering terrorism and stopping the
spread of nuclear weapons; securing the free flow of commerce, and
safe-guarding the security of the region]{.underline}**; standing up for
Israel's security and pursuing Arab-Israeli peace. We will continue to
do these things, with the firm belief that America's interests are not
hostile to peoples' hopes; they are essential to them. We believe that
no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in the region, or al Qaeda's
brutal attacks. People everywhere would see their economies crippled by
a cut off in energy supplies. As we did in the Gulf War, we will not
tolerate aggression across borders, and we will keep our commitments to
friends and partners. That outlook sat well with the overall aims of US
regional policy, which were to ensure the continued flow of the energy
products upon which the US depended (both directly and indirectly), to
promote economic growth and democracy, to ensure that transit and access
to US military bases in the region were maintained, and to discourage
any conflict that might threaten its allies in the region. Events and
circumstances often combined, however, to thwart those policy goals. A
prime example is the Arab Spring, a series of anti-government protests
and armed uprisings that began in 2011 with the suicide of a pushcart
vendor in Tunis in protest against government repression and which then
spread across North Africa and the Middle East. The Tunisian leader,
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was ousted from office, leading the protestors
in other countries to believe that they could accomplish similar
results. But, as with many such endeavours in the region, events
transpired in not quite positive ways. Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen entered
a period of turmoil, Libya and Syria devolved into civil wars, and the
monarchies of the Gulf States, notably Saudi Arabia, had to expend vast
sums of money as largesse to resist regional events and ensure their
stability. Iran was not immune to civilian unrest, either. The theocracy
there appeared to have lost all interest in ensuring the welfare of its
people and to be more concerned with denouncing the US, threatening to
drive the Israelis into the sea and to annihilate Israel itself, while
using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to foment unrest and instigate
guerrilla attacks against the theocracy's perceived enemies. Given his
desire to ensure a positive historical legacy, President Obama did
little to address the underlying causes of the Arab Spring or the
ill-advised policies of the theocrats in Iran. On the contrary, as the
events of [Project
Cassandra](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/)
demonstrate, President Obama virtually assisted Hezbollah in its
drug-smuggling operations in order to ensure that Iran entered into a
flawed and time-bound agreement not to continue with its nuclear
programme. On 16 January 2016, the same day that four US citizens who
were detained in Iran were released, President Obama authorised the
shipment of US\$400 million (\$563 million) in euros, Swiss francs and
other currencies in an aircraft to Tehran. A second shipment of US\$1.3
billion (\$1.8 billion) in cash soon followed. He was, essentially,
[paying a
ransom](https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-iran-payment-cash-20160907-snap-story.html)
to Iran in contravention of long-standing US norms of not dealing with
terrorists. Iranian citizens saw little of that money, however, because
the theocrats allegedly used it to prop up their soldiers and proxy
fighters in Yemen and Syria. Matters came to a head in 2017-18, when
[civilian
uprisings](http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/The-Ayatollahs-and-the-Demonstrators.pdf)
spread across Iran, leading to violent repressions. The Arab Spring had
reached Iran, albeit later than it did other countries. Iran and
Hezbollah have sought to counter the US and Israel in Syria and
elsewhere in the Middle East. That has led the current occupant of the
White House, President Trump, to take a hard line against it. His
withdrawal from Obama's nuclear deal with Iran -- the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- has led some observers to
conclude that he has embarked upon a course of action that aims to
isolate Iran and its current leaders. While the current US
administration has not made any specific statements to that end, it
remains clear that the US will keep all its options vis-à-vis Iran on
the table. The US relationship with Saudi Arabia appears to resemble
that with Iran. Although the relationship began well, US recriminations
against Saudi Arabia began in the 1970s, when the oil embargo saw oil
prices soar, availability diminish and trust between the two countries
erode. The Saudis had weaponised oil in order to force the US to
terminate its support for Israel. While it achieved some secondary
goals, that stratagem did not work. The lesson was obviously not lost on
President Trump, whose "America First" policy has caused the Arab élite
to doubt Washington's intentions and interest in maintaining regional
security. [While President Obama posed a particular set of security
risks to Riyadh with his JCPOA, President Trump poses a different, but
equally dangerous, one with his energy policy. With its new-found
capability to extract oil from shale deposits[, the US will likely
become a net exporter of oil sooner rather than
later]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its energy imports could fall to as low as
ten per cent of its total consumption, thus causing its dependence on
Middle Eastern imports to decline. [[That decline]{.mark}, coupled with
the current administration's apparent lack of interest in the region[,
leads the ruling élites]{.mark} there [to fear that Washington's
involvement in their area could wane]{.mark}, leaving them at
risk.]{.underline} In such a case, they fear, Washington's continued
involvement in the Middle East could rest almost entirely on its
aspirations for global economic hegemony, rather than the need to ensure
the region's security due to its dependence on the region's energy
resources. That will, almost inevitably, raise questions in Washington
about whether the costs of remaining in the region are proportionate to
the benefits derived from maintaining a presence there. For regional
states, [that line of thought leads to [an elevated degree of
uncertainty about Washington's desire to remain in the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}. These states are, for the most part,
underdeveloped in terms of infrastructure and militarily, even though
several are extremely wealthy. Having had their security underwritten by
the US since the Second World War, they now find themselves in
unfamiliar waters. [Given those circumstances, it is not surprising that
[Saudi Arabia has turned increasingly to China for military
systems]{.mark}, such as armed drones, that Washington, fearing that it
would upset the region's security balance were it to do so, refuses to
sell to it. I]{.underline}t is likely that Riyadh has also acquired the
technology to construct a ballistic missile facility from China.
Finally, given the emphasis of the current US administration on
transactional equivalence -- in this case, pressuring regional states
into sharing the costs of maintaining a US security presence there --
those regional states likely believe that a significant proportion of
their energy income could be spent on ensuring that the US remains in
the region. [Those states, including Saudi Arabia, would essentially be
paying the US to retain its regional hegemony. [The relationship of the
United States with the Middle East continues to be relatively strong but
is diminishing compared to its heyday. As the current US administration
continues to withdraw from the region, its position will continue to
erode and it could possibly be replaced by China.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Such a change would have major consequences for future developments
throughout the twenty-first century.

## Impact Turns

### Heg Bad\-\--China

#### Heg under trump ensure a massive China war

Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. \"How Trump
Is Ending the American Era\" Atlantic. Accessed 5-2-2019

[[Trump unrestrained is]{.mark} of course a **[frightening]{.mark}**
prospect.]{.underline} [[His instincts are not
reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}---if they were, he and his campaign would
have kept their distance from Russian operatives. [A man who has
presided over failed casinos, a collapsed airline, and a sham university
is not someone who knows when to step back from the brink.]{.underline}
[His [domestic political circumstances]{.mark}]{.underline}, already
bad, seem likely to deteriorate further, which **[[will only make him
more angry]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and perhaps more apt to take risks.
In a fit of temper or in the grip of spectacular misjudgment---possibly
influenced by what he's just seen on TV---[[he could stumble
into]{.mark} or launch [an **uncontrollable war.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
In one of the worst scenarios, [[Trump]{.mark}, as a result of his
alternating overtures to and belligerence toward China, [might bring
about a conflict with Xi Jinping]{.mark},]{.underline} who is
consolidating his own power in a way not seen since the days of Mao
Zedong. [Military [conflict between rising]{.mark} and preeminent
[global powers is hardly anomalous]{.mark}, after all, and **[the
Chinese are no longer in the mood to accept American
hegemony]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In 1990, when George H. W. Bush
confronted Saddam, an isolated dictator, a paralyzed Russia and weak
China were powerless to interfere. He had at his disposal the American
military at the peak of its post--Cold War strength, and a ready set of
allies. The United States has grown used to wars with limited risk
against minor and isolated rivals. [**[A conflict with China would be
something altogether different.]{.mark}** Trump is, and is likely to be
to the end, volatile, truculent, and impulsive.]{.underline} [When he
does face a crisis,]{.underline} whether or not it is of his own making,
[he will discover just how weak his hand is,]{.underline} because no
one---friends or enemies, the American public or foreign leaders---will
take anything that he promises or threatens at face value. At that point
we may find another Donald Trump emerging: the Trump who paid \$25
million to the victims of Trump University, who rages at The New York
Times and then truckles to its reporters. [Like most bullies, he can be
stared down. But [when he folds]{.mark}, **[American foreign policy will
fold with him.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Heg Bad\-\--Econ

#### US Heg wrecks the global economy

pursuit [bad for world economy]{.mark}]{.underline}\". Accessed 5-2-2019

However, there are three [[US officials]{.underline}]{.mark} who think
otherwise. They [[believe maintaining]{.mark} the absolute
[heg]{.mark}emony of the US and pursuing personal gains
[outweigh]{.mark} the wisdom of [US business]{.mark}es and
public]{.underline}, and the well-being of the world. Since Donald Trump
entered the White House, there have been factional feuds and policy
chaos within his administration. For example, on trade with China, there
are both [hardliners such as Trade Representative Robert [Lighthizer
and]{.mark} Peter [Navarro]{.mark}]{.underline}, director of the White
House National Trade Council, and moderate figures such as Secretary of
Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. After
several rounds of power wrangling, hardliners in the White House seemed
to [have [gained the upper hand]{.mark},]{.underline} with Trump,
Lighthizer and Navarro [[forming an \"iron triangle\",]{.mark} whose aim
is [to impose]{.mark} high [tariffs]{.mark} on US trade partners,
especially China, which they wrongly believe have gained unfair benefits
from trade with the US.]{.underline} As a businessman-turned-politician,
Trump claimed during his presidential campaign that China had stolen
jobs from the US and vowed to take them back for Americans. [Since
taking office, [Trump has taken a series of policy measures]{.mark} to
fulfill his campaign commitment, ostensibly to curry favor with voters,
consolidate his advantages in the midterm elections in November, and
pave the way for his re-election. To achieve these purposes, he has
ensured all previous US policies are subordinated to his personal ideas,
nay whims.]{.underline} China has become Trump\'s main target because he
believes his expert skills and tactics in business and trade may help
him realize his \"make America great again\" dream. And to push his
agenda forward, Trump looked for like-minded officials for important
posts. And Lighthizer, known as the US\' trade tsar, and Navarro, a
fabricator of the \"China threat\" theory fitted the bill perfectly.
Lighthizer is the chief designer of the investigations under Section 301
of the US Trade Act of 1974 and has participated in more than 20
international trade talks on steel, cars and agricultural products. He
is best known for his leading role in US efforts to force Japan into
signing the \"Plaza Accord\" in 1985. As early as 1999, Lighthizer
publicly declared China\'s entry into the World Trade Organization was a
threat to the US and accused Washington of backing down on trade issues.
He has been at the forefront of trade frictions with China, and is never
satisfied with any intended agreement reached with China to strike a
balance in bilateral trade. Instead, he wants to put more pressure on
China to carry out \"structural reform\" in an attempt to change
China\'s development path. As for Navarro, he had never visited China
before this year. He focused on electricity and energy in his early
years, but this did not prevent him from becoming a second-hand
materials expert, cobbling together the \"China threat\" theory and a
few books identifying China as an \"imaginary enemy\". He has never let
go a single opportunity to launch a verbal attack on China using his
so-called experience of working with several US agencies. Eventually, he
caught the attention of Trump, and was appointed as one of his main
policy advisers. [As a staunch [supporter of populism and
protectionism]{.mark}, the \"iron triangle\" in the White House [suffers
from zero-sum mentality]{.mark} and is determined to maintain US
hegemony.]{.underline} However, the triumvirate doesn\'t know much about
China and thus has an obsessive bias against the country. To begin
with[, [Trump has no experience]{.mark} of a trade war,]{.underline} and
he would be overestimating his capability if he believed China could be
subdued by using some business deals and extreme pressure. Lighthizer
did achieve success in dealing with Japan in the 1980s, but China today
is not what Japan was in 1985, and the strategy and tactics that proved
effective against Japan decades ago will simply not work against China.
And the theory Navarro has cooked up to deal with \"China\'s economic
aggression\" may seem potent, but only on paper. US citizens just
celebrated Independence Day on July 4. [Ironically, though, after more
than two centuries of development, the free trade and open policies
pursued by US statesmen in the past have been overturned by the Trump
administration.]{.underline} The traditional values that made the
founding fathers of the US proud are being upended and shelved by the
\"iron triangle\". [[There is little doubt the US is drifting toward
isolationism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some say **[[the US is on the
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But who is to blame? US leaders, of
course.
