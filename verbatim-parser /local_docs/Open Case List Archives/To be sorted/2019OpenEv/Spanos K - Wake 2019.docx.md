The other difference, as we have seen, indissolubly related to the
first, is that, [[despite its infinitely more powerful military might,
the United States lost the war to the recalcitrant subaltern
Other]{.mark}]{.underline} it would have subdued and accommodated to its
Logos. And it lost it primarily because in this globalized postcolonial
context---and by way of the disclosures re- leased by the
self-destruction of the end-oriented philosophical, epistemo- logical,
ecological, cultural, political, and military mechanisms of Western
imperialism---America's Other, as Greene foresaw and Caputo, O'Brien,
and many other veterans who have recalled their experience in writing
have testified, refused to be answerable to the imperatives of the
polyvalent American exceptionalist narrative. [[The Vietnamese's
response rather was to be rhizomatically mobile, strategically
indeterminate in its goals, erratic in its actions]{.mark}, indifferent
to temporal and spatial boundaries]{.underline}, resistant (in its
attunement to the slow motion of being) to the dictates of technological
speed, and not least, invisible to America's techno-Ahabian gaze, all
calculated to decompose the relay of American power extending back from
its forward-oriented military machine through its progressivist
capitalist cultural apparatus, to the instrumentalist (Franklinian
"can-do") [thinking that was envisioning, planning, and conducting the
war from the remote distance of the Pentagon. This double
difference---an American war the ruthless, single-minded and banalized
conduct of which disclosed the violence hidden in the benign American
exceptionalist errand, on the one hand, and, by way of this banalized
single-mindedness, enabled its Other to fracture its formidable war
machine and reduce its power to impotence, on the
other]{.underline}---constitutes the proleptic witness of Graham
Greene's novel, written in the immediate aftermath of the Geneva
Accords, about America's initial arrogant---and blind---intervention in
Vietnam. Despite their efforts to personalize and then assimilate this
war to war-in-general, this double difference, as I have shown, is also
the symptomatic testimony of Philip Caputo's representa- tive memoir, A
Rumor of War, and Tim O'Brien's autobiographical novel, Going After
Cacciato, whose mis-en-scènes span the period between 1965, when
President Lyndon Johnson, justified by the fabricated Tonkin Bay
incident, sent the first official combat troops to fight in the "Indian
country" of Vietnam, and the Tet Offensive in 1968, which was the be-
ginning of the end of the United States' bloody imperial involvement in
that Southeast Asian country. [[This resonant witness to the visible
contradiction between America's deeply backgrounded ontological
justification of the Vietnam War and its single-minded, indeed,
monomaniacal Ahabian practice has haunted the]{.mark} collective
[American]{.mark} [consciousness since the fall of Saigon in
1975]{.mark}.]{.underline} This specter also explains the dominant
culture's obsessive effort since then to forget Vietnam---an amnesiac
monumentalizing process only apparently culminating in the first Gulf
War and a triumphant "end-of-history" discourse---and its studied
avoidance of reference to the Vietnam War in justifying to the American
people and the world at large its ferocious retaliatory attack first on
Afghanistan and then, using the language of "shock and awe," [which
resonates with the ferocity of Captain Ahab's "fiery pursuit" of the
white whale, on Iraq]{.underline}. This double difference is, I am
suggesting, also why it is imperative that intellectuals, public and
academic, who oppose the United States' representation and conduct of
the "war on terror" retrieve the forgotten memory of the Vietnam War as
Greene's, Caputo's, and O'Brien's representative texts articulate its
singularity. For, as I have shown, their spectral witness to the terror
of the "search-and-destroy" mentality inhering in the myth of American
exceptionalism, despite the sustained effort to obliterate it from
history, continues, in the aftermath of 9/11, to haunt the present
American government's---and the American media's---reductive
personification of the complex global conditions that Western
imperialism and more recently [America itself have largely produced in
the name of its exceptionalist mission in the world's wilderness, in the
demonized symbolic figures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, its
most recent Moby Dicks]{.underline}. The [[Vietnam War's spectral
witness to a mighty America's humiliating defeat at the hands of an
Other]{.underline}]{.mark}---its other that [refused to answer to the
accommodational impera- tives of its exceptionalist story in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}---has now, as the initial seemingly successful
invasion of Iraq has turned unexpectedly into a destabilizing and
volatile occupation, one resembling the Vietnam "quagmire," returned
again to haunt America. As revenant, the singular history of the Vietnam
War exposes [America's metaphysical, epistemological, cultural,
military, and political initiatives for what they are in a diverse and
amorphous part of the world whose people have for centuries suffered the
terrible consequences of being the second essentialized term in the
Occident's binary logic.]{.underline} It is thus as likely as it was for
the Vietnamese "enemy" that the decidedly undecidable "enemy" it is
encountering there will turn the United States' inordinate power against
itself. [To put all this in another way, [the United States "succeeded"
in its preemptive military mission to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan
and Saddam Hussein's army in Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It has
captured and hanged Saddam Hussein and may eventually capture and bring
Osama bin Laden to trial (even, against the judicial tradition of
democracy, to be tried by a military court). But granted these
"accomplishments," [President George W. Bush and his [neoconserative
intellectual deputies are no more likely to]{.mark} annul or even
[assuage the outrage that the United States has increasingly
ignited]{.mark} both among its former European allies and the various
Islamic peoples of the world at large [by]{.mark} their concentering of
the cultural, social, and polit- ical global morass [their
exceptionalist ethos]{.mark} has produced than Captain Ahab's
"monomania"]{.underline}---was able to annul the self-defensive outrage
of the ineffable "white" whale. This is becoming increasingly evident in
the failure of this second Bush administration's monolithic effort to
recreate the Afghanistani and Iraqi nation-states in its own (liberal
capitalist) image (as the administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon
Baines Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon failed to recreate a Vietnamese
nation-state in its own image in the 1960s and 1970s). It is also
becoming increasingly evident in [[the diverse Iraqi peoples'
spontaneous cultural and military re- sistance]{.mark} to the American
occupation of their lands, a resistance that, omi- nously like that of
the Vietnamese, [refuses to be answerable to the United States'
exceptionalist/Orientalist narrative]{.mark} and to the forwarding
warfare that is endemic to it.]{.underline} What I am suggesting by way
of invoking the witness of the literature I have examined in this book
about the ultimate consequences of [[America's]{.mark} predictably
[Ahabian response to the attacks on the World Trade Center]{.mark} and
the Pentagon should [become unequivocally manifest by reconstellating
both these moments of American history into the "hidden history of the
revolutionary Atlantic]{.mark}"]{.underline} (the period extending from
the ori- gins of the Atlantic slave trade to the revolutionary years)
brilliantly re- trieved by Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker from the
oblivion to which it has been relegated by the "Herculean" monumentalist
historians of this earlier epochal moment of the march of Western
civilization: [The classically educated architects of the Atlantic
economy found in Hercules . . . a symbol of power and order. [For
inspiration they looked to the Greeks, for whom Hercules was a unifier
of the centralized territorial state, and to the Romans, for whom he
signified vast imperial ambition]{.mark}.]{.underline} The labors of
Hercules symbolized economic development: clearing of land, the draining
of swamps, and the development of agriculture, as well as the
domestication of livestock, the establishment of commerce, and the
introduction of technology. The rulers placed the image of Hercules on
money and seals, in pictures, sculptures, and palaces, and on arches of
triumph. . . . John Adams, for his part, proposed in 1776 that "The
Judgment of Hercules" be the seal for the new United States of America.
. . . [[These same rulers found in the many-headed hydra an antithetical
symbol of disorder and resistance, a powerful threat to the building of
state, empire, and capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The second labor of
Hercules was the destruction of the venomous hydra of Lerna. . . . From
the beginning of English colonial expansion in the early seventeenth
century through the metropolitan industrialization of the early
nineteenth, [rulers referred to the Hercules-hydra myth to describe the
difficulty of imposing order on increasingly global systems of
labor.]{.underline} They variously designated dispossessed commoners,
transported felons, indentured servants, religious radicals, pirates,
urban laborers, soldiers, sailors, and African slaves as the numerous
ever-changing heads of the monster. [But the heads, though originally
brought into productive combina- tion by their Herculean rulers, soon
developed among themselves new forms of cooperation against those
rulers, from mutinies and strikes to riots and insurrections and
revolution.]{.underline}18 As Philip Caputo, Tim O'Brien, and virtually
every American soldier who fought in Vietnam reiteratively testify,
[[the insurgents of the National Liberation Front in Vietnam, like the
many-headed hydra of European antiquity (and of the revolutionary
Atlantic economy), were constantly defeated by the "Herculean" American
military juggernaut]{.mark}, but they nevertheless kept rising up in
unpredictable places and times to eventually bring their would-be
monster-slayer to a dead end]{.underline}. Given the incommensurability
of America's predictable invocation of the (mythical) logic of
exceptionalism and the postcolonial globalized condition, [there is
little reason to believe that the hatred precipitated by the United
States' perennial unilateral "defense" of its "interests" in the Islamic
world---a defense expedited by its reduction of the diversity of this
world to an abstract and predictable religioracist frontier stereotype,
the "clash of civilizations"---]{.underline} will not also manifest
itself as a "many-headed hydra" that will resurface in unexpected places
at unexpected times to constantly molecularize--- and neutralize the
power of America---its narrative, its self-present will, and its
relentlessly forwarding military machine.

#### Without the question of rethinking thinking itself, we become guised under colonialist rules perpetrating in an ongoing cycle that never stops

But to speak of the circular space perceived by the Eurocentric eye of
the Enlightenment as an unknown, unnamed, and unimproved space that
\"demands\" to be known, named, and improved is to realize that the
civilizing or enlightening mission of the Enlightenment also requires
specification both of the articulation of that space and of the effects
of that spatial economy on knowledge and power. [To put it generally,
the Eurocentric solar or panoptic eye of the Enlightenment turned the
earlier \"emptiness\" of the circle of its vision into a measurable
space. Whereas the imperial eye of the pre-Enlightenment --- the early
Spanish conquistadores, for example --- tended to (over)see the circle
it projected as a generalized amorphous and thus immediately plunderable
space, the Enlightenment eye came to oversee the (always expanding)
circle it projected as a mappable organic space]{.underline}, a vital
differential world in which the comparative knowledge of its details
enhances the power of the encompassing eye of the beholder over its
organic \"branching.\" As his presiding analogy between the domain of
knowledge and the geographical world clearly suggests, what the French
philosophe D\'Alembert says in 1751 about the domain of knowledge before
and after the emergence of the mapping eye in his Preliminary Discourse
to the Encyclopedia of Diderot applies as well to the relationship
between the Enlightenment Metropolis and the provinces. [Indeed, it
applies right down to the roles that \"travelers\'\" narratives and the
ensuing opening of lines of communication to the Metropolis play in the
process of mastering the labyrinthine Other]{.underline}: The execution
\[\"of a genealogical or encyclopedic tree which will gather the various
branches of knowledge together under a single point of view\"\] is not
without difficulty\... .The general system of the sciences and the arts
is a sort of labyrinth, a torturous road which the intellect enters
without quite knowing what direction to take\.... The discontinuity of
these operations is a necessary effect of the very generation of ideas.
However philosophic this disorder may be on the part of the soul, an
encyclopedic tree which attempted to portray it would be disfigured,
indeed utterly destroyed\.... It is not the same with the encyclopedic
arrangement of our knowledge. [This consists of collecting knowledge
into the smallest area possible and of placing the philosopher at a
vantage point, so to speak, high above the vast labyrinth, whence he can
perceive the principal sciences and the arts simultaneously. From there
he can see at a glance the objects of their speculations and the
operations which can be made on these objects; he can discern the
general branches of human knowledge, the points that separate or unite
them; and sometimes he can even glimpse the secrets that related them to
one another]{.underline}. It is a kind of world map which is to show the
principal countries, their position and their mutual dependence, the
road that leads directly from one to another[. This road is often cut by
a thousand obstacles, which are known in each country only to the
inhabitants or to travelers, and which cannot be represented except in
individual, highly detailed maps.]{.underline} These individual maps
will be the different articles of the Encyclopedia and the Tree or
Systematic Chart will be its world map.80 The difference between the two
historical moments, in other words, is the difference between a mapped
space understood, as in the case of the early European explorers, as a
periplum (\"not as land seen on a map/but sea bord seen by men
sailing\"),81 and a mapped space conceived, as Foucault has shown, as a
self-consciously mediative mode of knowledge/power production analogous
in its structure to, if not entirely dependent on, the \"tables\" based
on the ontologically, invariably racially, grounded systems of
classification that emerged in the Enlightenment. These were the
polyvalent taxonomic tables --- best exemplified by the Systema Naturae
(1735), Philosophia Botanica (1751), and Species Plantarum (1753) of
Linnaeus, the Histoire naturelle (1749) of Buffon, the Nosologie
methodique (1772) of Boissier de Sauvages (\"the Linnaeus of
diseases\"),82 and the Families des plantes (1763) of Michel Adanson83
--- [that differentiated, named, graded, and accommodated an amorphous
organic multiplicity within an inclusive structure that miniaturizes and
renders visible a larger, otherwise invisible, and \"ungraspable\"
totality. As such, they became the disciplinary model for the classroom,
the mass production factory, the penal institution, the medical clinic,
the psychiatric hospital, the capitalist system of economic exchange,
and the practice of military warfare in the \"disciplinary
society\":]{.underline} The first of the great operations of discipline
is\... the constitution of \"tableaux vivants,\" which transform the
confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplicities.
The drawing up of \"tables\" was one of the great problems of the
scientific, political and economic technology of the eighteenth century:
how one was to arrange botanical and zoological gardens, and construct
at the same time rational classifications of living beings; [how one was
to observe, supervise, regularize the circulation of commodities and
money and thus build up an economic table that might serve as the
principle of the increase of wealth; how one was to inspect men, observe
their presence and absence and constitute a general and permanent
register of the armed forces; how one was to distribute patients,
separate them from one another, divide up the hospital space and make a
systematic classification of diseases: these were all twin operations in
which the two elements]{.underline} --- distribution and analysis,
supervision and intelligibility --- are inextricably bound up. In the
eighteenth century the table was both a technique of power and a
procedure of knowledge. [It was a question of organizing the multiple,
of providing oneself with an instrument to cover it and to master it; it
was a question of imposing upon it an \"order.\"84 To these
differentiated dedifferentiated (accommodational) \"imperial\"
structures produced by the miniaturization and spatialization of time
should be added the reduction and hierarchized structuration of
languages, of gender and race relations, and, not least, of the
discourse and practice --- the visualization or re-presentation and
administration of --- the nation-state and the colonial
empire.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to rethink thinking -- Vietnam proves the solvency of ontological tactics

[Given this utterly reduced condition of thinking, the \"ends of man\"
thus points to the (self)dis-closure of that spectral force field of
differences that the \"truth\" of the age of the world picture cannot
finally contain within its imperial circumference]{.underline}. The
moment that the structuralist logic of the discourse of modern
anthropology reaches its limits --- achieves closure --- means, finally,
the delegitimation of the (\"disinterested\" or \"objective\") truth
discourse of Occidental humanism. [This, it must be remembered, is the
post-Enlightenment \"anthropology\" that, under the allotropic names of
\"the free world\" or \"liberal \[American\] democracy,\" has come to be
represented in the aftermath of the Cold War and the \"kicking of the
Vietnam syndrome\" as \"the end of history\" by the spokespersons of
\"America.\" In the face of this triumphalist ontological representation
of the contemporary occasion --- which is to say, this astonishingly
amnesiac historical memory --- would not a \"postcolonial\" opposition
be better served by discarding the worn-out, ontologically empty word
\"postmodernism\"?]{.underline} Would it not, further, be preferable to
undertake the postcolonial project by thinking the dangerous political
occasion called \"the New World Order\" in the resonant spectral terms
recalled by Derrida\'s early effort to think the \"ends of man\" in the
context of the Vietnam War? [This, at any rate, is the suggestive
oppositional project Derrida proposes in Specters of Marx, his most
recent and most political repetition of the \"Heideggerian\" effort of
ontological retrieval, in the wake of the dominant liberal/capitalist
culture\'s proclamation at the end of the Cold War of the death and
burial of Marx and its euphoric announcement of the \"gospel,\" \"the
good news\" that has been brought into being by the dialectical labor of
History in the \"fullness of time]{.underline}.\"22 And, as I have
suggested by pointing to its affiliation with Said\'s invocation of the
political emigre, it is a proposal that demands urgent attention.
Indeed, it is the imperative of thinking in the interregnum, given the
apparent indifference of postmodern/postcolonial criticism, [which
restricts its understanding of the new globalism to the untethered flow
of transnational capital, to this other, equally pervasive, nationalist
globalism, which represents the present post-Cold War moment not simply
as the end of History, but as the triumph of \"America\" as well. If, as
I have suggested, this alleged \"good news\" is understood, as I think
it should be, as the triumphant annunciation of a fully realized
imperial and banalizing project of thinking, of an \"advent,\" as it
were (the Pax Metaphysica), as well as the completed imperial and
banalizing project of sociopolitics (the Pax Americana), then it becomes
the task of a \"postcolonial\" opposition not simply to retrieve the
differential event that the announcement of \"good news\" has had to
obliterate in order to legitimize the planetary truth of liberal
capitalist democracy.]{.underline} (It should not be overlooked that
this end-of-history discourse repeats in thought the violence in
practice to which the American officer in Vietnam synecdochically
referred when he declared that \"\[w\]e had to destroy Ben Tre in order
to save it.\")23 [It also becomes a postcolonial opposition\'s task to
think that repressed event in terms of the implications of its
persistent and anxiety-provoking spectral afterlife for a way of
thinking capable of disarticulating or molecularizing the inordinate
positive power of the triumphant imperial discourse.]{.underline} It has
not been my purpose in this book to undertake this rethinking of
thinking, though I want to emphasize that what I have said in the
preceding chapters makes it clear that this initiative would benefit by
attuning itself to the de-structive (or decentering) project Heidegger
inaugurated in Being and Time in the wake of the forgetting of the
Seinsfrage (which is to say, of the closure of philosophy) and that
Derrida and Foucault, in different ways, extended and modified.
[Finally, however, it is not so much to theory as such that the project
to rethink thinking in the interregnum must look as it is to the
violence of the history of the Occidental thought and practice I have
retrieved.]{.underline} This history, bathed in innocent blood,
emphatically suggests that such a thinking must take its point of
departure from the self-de-struction of the discourse of Man in the
Vietnam War --- the event that synecdochically and decisively disclosed
not only the essential complicity of Occidental thought with imperial
practice, but also the essential affiliation between the dissemination
inhering in its Word and the diasporic consequences of the fulfillment
of its Word\'s logic. To \"repeat\" my beginning after a long detour, it
must take its positive point of departure from the negative force ---
the \"decentered\" or, in the allotropes of Edward Said and Gilles
Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the \"unhoused\" or \"deterritorialized\" or
\"diasporic\" or \"nomadic\" energies --- released into history as
haunting specters by the fulfillment of this European Word\'s reifying
or spatial, which is to say, imperial, logic. This task reflects the
poverty --- the \"damaged life\" --- of the exiled intellectual in the
interregnum. [Having learned from its fate at the hands of the colonial
regime of truth, however, such a differential/exilic thinking of the
Abgeschiedene, unlike the modes of opposition that sanguinely continue
to think in the ontological terms prescribed by the master discourse, is
not only enabled to refuse to play by the rules of its imperial logic.
It is also enabled to transform this negative condition into a positive
force of resistance. As I hope these chapters have shown, such a
strategic \"nomadic\" thinking, more than any other that is currently
available, will be adequate to the task of writing the history of the
present and, though it may in the end be the same thing, of deterring
liberal capitalist democracy and the Pax Americana. But, it needs to be
underscored, the self-de-struction of the imperial truth discourse of
the post-Enlightenment incumbent on the fulfillment of its ontologic
should not merely be thought in terms of resisting an oppressive and
banalizing tradition. For this dis-closure of its plenary circle also
and simultaneously releases pro-jective possibilities. To think
positively the spectral Other that haunts Occidental thought---\"the
shadow that the light of Being has not been able to illumine,\" in
Enrique Dussel\'s resonant formulation24 ---]{.underline} is, therefore,
to open up the possibility of a different idea of the polis from that
envisioned by the metaphysical (and Roman) West. It is, finally, to
bring into being (to liberate) the thought of a differential polity, a
polity in which the dialogue that is the essential condition of our
mortal being-with takes place not in the seductive paradisal realm to
which it has, in fact, been strategically confined by liberal democracy,
but in this unequal world, where imbalance of power --- and injustice
--- always rules.

economy found in Hercules . . . a symbol of power and order. [For
inspiration they looked to the Greeks, for whom Hercules was a unifier
of the centralized territorial state, and to the Romans, for whom he
signified vast imperial ambition]{.mark}.]{.underline} The labors of
Hercules symbolized economic development: clearing of land, the draining
of swamps, and the development of agriculture, as well as the
domestication of livestock, the establishment of commerce, and the
introduction of technology. The rulers placed the image of Hercules on
money and seals, in pictures, sculptures, and palaces, and on arches of
triumph. . . . John Adams, for his part, proposed in 1776 that "The
Judgment of Hercules" be the seal for the new United States of America.
. . . [[These same rulers found in the many-headed hydra an antithetical
symbol of disorder and resistance, a powerful threat to the building of
state, empire, and capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The second labor of
Hercules was the destruction of the venomous hydra of Lerna. . . . From
the beginning of English colonial expansion in the early seventeenth
century through the metropolitan industrialization of the early
nineteenth, [rulers referred to the Hercules-hydra myth to describe the
difficulty of imposing order on increasingly global systems of
labor.]{.underline} They variously designated dispossessed commoners,
transported felons, indentured servants, religious radicals, pirates,
urban laborers, soldiers, sailors, and African slaves as the numerous
ever-changing heads of the monster. [But the heads, though originally
brought into productive combina- tion by their Herculean rulers, soon
developed among themselves new forms of cooperation against those
rulers, from mutinies and strikes to riots and insurrections and
revolution.]{.underline}18 As Philip Caputo, Tim O'Brien, and virtually
every American soldier who fought in Vietnam reiteratively testify,
[[the insurgents of the National Liberation Front in Vietnam, like the
many-headed hydra of European antiquity (and of the revolutionary
Atlantic economy), were constantly defeated by the "Herculean" American
military juggernaut]{.mark}, but they nevertheless kept rising up in
unpredictable places and times to eventually bring their would-be
monster-slayer to a dead end]{.underline}. Given the incommensurability
of America's predictable invocation of the (mythical) logic of
exceptionalism and the postcolonial globalized condition, [there is
little reason to believe that the hatred precipitated by the United
States' perennial unilateral "defense" of its "interests" in the Islamic
world---a defense expedited by its reduction of the diversity of this
world to an abstract and predictable religioracist frontier stereotype,
the "clash of civilizations"---]{.underline} will not also manifest
itself as a "many-headed hydra" that will resurface in unexpected places
at unexpected times to constantly molecularize--- and neutralize the
power of America---its narrative, its self-present will, and its
relentlessly forwarding military machine.

#### Their projections of mass violence rely on the instrumental logic of the Pax Americana \-\-- this creates a perverse fascination with death that exports violence across the world and commits American existence to total war 

**Masco 12** \[Joseph Masco, "The End of Ends," *Anthropological
Quarterly*, Volume 85, Number 4, Fall 2012\]

Within modern political theory [[the means to an end has been embedded
within the very concept of rationality,]{.mark} making ends and means
synonymous with progress, a perpetual engine of improving the
infrastructures of everyday life as well as the morality of those living
within it.]{.underline} Within this modernity---glossed here as the
application of reason to nature as progress---we have few efforts to
theorize the reality or implication of conceptual blockages or
blindnesses within the very notion of security. The assumption that
instrumental reason is not only a means to an end but an essential good
structures a Euro-American modernity in which superstition is set
against the possibility of an unending technological progress
(Horkheimer and Adorno 2002:1). [Benjamin]{.underline} (1969) [offers
perhaps the most powerful critique of "progress" by showing how the
promise of the "new" can be the vehicle of social mystification and
entrenchment]{.underline}. His call to "brush history against the grain"
and establish a critical method that can "seize hold of a memory as it
flashes up at a moment of danger" is ultimately a call to [resist the
normalization (and naturalization) of violence in everyday
life.]{.underline} But [how]{.underline}, and under what terms, [can
this be accomplished in a national security state that is premised on
the total ending of nuclear war]{.underline}? [[Having built the war
machine as a global system]{.underline}]{.mark}, [how can a society turn
towards an alternative notion of security, one not grounded in the
technological possibility of total nuclear war?]{.underline}
[How]{.underline}, indeed, [does thinking about an absolute ending work
to **[install a new set of fantasies]{.mark}** and short circuits that
prevent reflexive critique]{.underline}? [How do rational modes of
planning work not to eliminate the possibility of collective death but
rather]{.underline}, through self-mystification, to [install its
possibility ever deeper into an expert state system]{.underline}? Kant
(1986) articulated one central area where reason is installed as a
compensation for a lack of understanding in his notion of the sublime.
[Sublime experience,]{.underline} in his view, [overwhelms the human
sensorium providing that **strange mix of [pleasure and terror]{.mark}**
involved in **[surpassing one's cognitive limit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For Kant, the experience of incomprehensibility is then managed by an
act of categorizing---by a naming of the event---rather than through
understanding. [Compensation rather than comprehension is thus
achieved]{.underline}, [installing at the very center of his notion of
reason an irreducible problem about means, ends,]{.underline} [and the
ability of human beings in extreme moments to comprehend both. "Terror"
has an inherent sublimity, one that has been multiplied across
contemporary crisis]{.underline}---war, economy, environment---[to
create a new complex configuration of planetary risk that exceeds the
power of the national security state]{.underline} (Masco 2010).
[[Nuclear terror,]{.mark} as a permanent state system, however, [is
n]{.mark}ot a momentary experience]{.underline} (as Kant's sublime
requires) [but is instead [a **global
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[one [that coordinates
American military power as well as its domestic
politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This infrastructure requires constant
affective \[End Page 1115\] as well as technological support, [merging
complex social and technological processes that become **[fused in
perceptions of global risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Put differently,
[instrumental reason has orchestrated our globalized, economized,
technologized modernity but it has also installed a set of]{.underline}
[compensations for those events, desires, and biological facts that
**disrupt specific calculations**]{.underline} of progress/profit. By
the mid-20th century, the products of **[instrumental
reason]{.underline}**---[the very means to an
end]{.underline}---**[[produced new forms of war that ultimately
challenged the survival of the species.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
atomic bomb stands as both a rational technology---produced via the
combined work of physicists, engineers, chemists, industrialists,
military planners, defense intellectuals, and civilian policy
makers---and as a limit case to that instrumental reason (see Edwards
1996, Oakes 1994). In the early days of the nuclear age, some Manhattan
Project scientists hoped this new technology would be so terrible that
it would simply end the possibility of war (e.g., Federation of American
Scientists 1946). Instead, US war planners built a global system for
nuclear war that could end life itself within a few minutes of actual
conflict. Each new nuclear system---bomber, submarine, and missile---was
both a technological achievement of the first order and an accelerating
progression towards the end of modernity in the form of nuclear war.
[What these technical experts were attempting to negotiate through
engineering is a **[basic relationship to death]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[a perverse project of building ever more destructive machines in the
name of producing "security]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}" Indeed,
displacing the threat of one machine (the bomb) with another (the bomb)
became the basis for deterrence theory, a way of organizing and
containing the thought of death by expanding technological systems.
[Freud]{.underline} (1991) [saw this contradiction in militarism early
on]{.underline}, and in his remarkable 1915 essay "Thoughts for the
Times on War and Death" he is definitive that **[it is impossible to
comprehend]{.underline}**---to actually believe in---**[one's own
death]{.underline}**. Thus, he notes, [even as the human organism moves
closer to death]{.underline} with each tick of the clock, [the ego
pursues a program of immortality and works to **[relocate the onrushing
reality of death]{.mark} to exterior locations**]{.underline}---**[to
novels, [to foreign populations, to distant wars, to a radical
outside]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, [the thought of an "**end**ing"
here literally produces a **new set of
means**]{.underline}---[fantasies]{.underline},
[projections]{.underline}, [displacements]{.underline}, [and amnesias
all]{.underline} **[[mobilized to suture together an idea of an eternal
self]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In American national-culture, [the Cold War
performed this task through a series of]{.underline}
[circuits]{.underline}: [the communist threat was simultaneously
everywhere and nowhere]{.underline}, [and the immanent threat of nuclear
war was mitigated by a]{.underline} fetishistic [focus on technological
detail]{.underline}. [Cold War planners managed the threat of nuclear
war through constant prolif]{.underline}eration---of weapons, delivery
systems, **[images, theories, and calculations]{.underline}**. [Through
this proliferation]{.underline}, Cold War [planners pursued a program of
intellectual compensation for the **confrontation with a new kind of
death**]{.underline}. [They did so by mobilizing all national
resources]{.underline} (changing the very temporal horizon of war from
days, to hours, to minutes in the process), [as well as by pursuing
proxy wars and covert actions around the world. In the process,
Americans learned how to be **[committed to total war as a precondition
for everyday life while locating death as exterior to the
nation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even as the war machine grew ferociously
in its technological capacities]{.underline}. [This represents a
distinctive]{.underline} national-cultural [achievement]{.underline}: a
notion of [security that brings collective [**death ever closer** in an
attempt to **fix its location with ever more
precision**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} By the time of the first Corona
photograph, [the US nuclear system was on constant and permanent
alert]{.underline}, [managing a global war]{.underline} [machine on a
minute-by-minute temporal scale]{.underline}---one that imagined a
Soviet nuclear strike coming with less than seven minutes warning
(Keeney 2011:186). [US]{.underline} military systems became both the
most direct application of technical rationality and the location of
deep fantasies about national immortality and systems of total control.
In the first decade of the Cold War, for example, the lack of detailed
intelligence about the Soviet Union enabled an American national
security project that was both technologically utopian and driven by
increasingly apocalyptic visions of an omnipotent other. A top-secret,
blue-ribbon panel studying the possibility of nuclear civil defense in
1957, known as the Gaither Committee, not only recommended a nationwide
commitment to building underground bunkers and training citizens to
think calmly about experiencing nuclear war, its members also concluded
that a "missile gap" with the Soviet Union left the US increasingly
vulnerable to a devastating "first strike" (Security Resources Panel of
the Science Advisory Committee 1957). Reinforced by the hysteria over
Sputnik later in 1957---the first artificial satellite in space---US
national security debates, by the end of the 1950s, were structured by
visions of a Soviet sneak attack that would destroy urban America in an
instant. The Gaither Committee leaked to the press their conclusion that
by 1959 the Soviets would have a decisive advantage in ICBMs (see Roman
1995, Snead 1999) provoking huge nuclear arms expenditures in the US.
The domestic politics informing the "missile gap" narrative \[End Page
1117\] were part of the battle between military branches for nuclear
resources and soon key to John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign
strategy of positioning his Republican rivals (Eisenhower and then
Nixon) as weak on national security. Thus, a [threat projection with
multiple political uses became codified as a kind of truth in US
national security policy]{.underline}, [leading to massive increases in
defense spending at the end of the Eisenhower administration and then
again at the start of the Kennedy]{.underline}
[administratio]{.underline}n. The nuclear triad---of bombers, ICBMs, and
submarines---is built at this moment, providing multiple redundant
systems for waging nuclear war and giving each branch of the military a
nuclear capability. Today we can see that in addition to the new weapons
systems built at the end of the 1950s, there was also an important
political discovery crucial to the evolving Cold War: namely, [the
universal utility [of **threat proliferation** in **US security
culture**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The raw political value of existential
threat as a motivating narrative became a well-worn domestic
strat]{.underline}]{.mark}[egy]{.underline} in the US, one linking the
"missile gap" of the 1950s to the "window of vulnerability" of the
1970s, to the "strategic defense initiative" of the 1980s to the "space
based Pearl Harbor" narratives of the 1990s to the terrorist "WMD"
discourses of the 2000s as illustrations of a nuclear culture. In each
of these cases, [we can see how the bomb]{.underline} (as a consolidated
form of existential threat) [has been good for Americans to think
with]{.underline}, [becoming the basis for building a nuclear state and
a global military system but also for transforming raw military ambition
into a necessary form of "defense."]{.underline} But [if the bomb has
been crucial to]{.underline} [constituting US "superpower" status, it
has also produced a complex new **[domestic affective political
domain]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[allowing images
of]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and appeals to, **[[existential threat to
become a central means of establishing and expanding a militarized
national security culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By 1961, US war
planners sought to rationalize a vast set of military logics and
capabilities into a comprehensive war plan---known as the Single
Integrated Operating Plan or SIOP. The first plan, known as SIOP-62,
promised to reduce contingency and error, and to coordinate a US war
machine that included bombers, submarines, and missiles deployed
globally, as well as a vast array of front line nuclear technologies,
from nuclear cannons, to backpack bombs, to atomic land mines (see Sagan
1987, Ball and Toth 1990, and Burr 2004). The first SIOP had two options
each involving a total assault on the communist block---preemptive war
and retaliation. What is crucial to acknowledge today is that SIOP-62
was not a war plan in any traditional sense, rather it articulated in
technologically \[End Page 1118\] feasible terms a total ending (see
Keeney 2002, Burr 2005, Rosenberg and Moore 1981/1982). The preemptive
option could be triggered by "signs" of an imminent Soviet attack. What
constituted a definitive "sign" of such an attack however was left
unstated, creating potential slippages between different
organizations---the Strategic Air Command, the Navy, and the White
House, for example---which might interpret Soviet actions differently.
American Cold War state and nation-building was also increasingly
devoted to rehearsing a surprise attack on the US and to applying the
worst-case scenario thinking as normative (Masco 2008). The preemptive
option in SIOP-62 committed the full US arsenal in a simultaneous global
nuclear strike, involving 3,200 nuclear weapons delivered to 1,060
targets around the world. In short, it was a plan to eliminate
"communism" from planet Earth within a few hours of nuclear war. It
involved targets not only in the Soviet Union, but also China (not yet a
nuclear power), and all of their allied states. In a few hours of
nuclear war, hundreds of cities, and more than 500 million people would
be destroyed, followed by millions more from radiation injuries. Not
included in this calculation were nuclear counterstrikes or the
environmental or climatic consequences of nuclear war, which would have
magnified and spread these effects to all corners of the globe. The
scale of destruction detailed in SIOP-62 is a distinctive moment in
human history and is, in Kant's strict technical sense of the term,
sublime. [It is beyond comprehension, which raises a crucial issue about
how the nuclear state resolves such terror/complexity]{.underline}. In
national security planning, [the compensation for this experience of
cognitive overload was a fixation on command and control, as well as the
articulation of **[specific war calculations]{.mark}**, marking degrees
of violence for **[different nuclear war
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Kahn 1960, Eden 2004). [What would
likely be an [**unknown chaos**]{.mark} of missiles and bombs launched
for the first time from a vast range of technologies]{.underline},
located all over the planet under deeply varied conditions, [appears on
paper as a **[rational program of cause and
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[threat and preemption]{.underline}**,
**[attack and counter attack]{.underline}**. **[This was an apocalyptic
vision presented simply as math]{.underline}**]{.mark}. From 1962 until
today, the SIOP nuclear war plan has been continually revised and
rationalized for different global political contexts but never truly
abandoned (McKinzie, Cochran, Norris, and Arkin 2001). [The US maintains
the ability to destroy all major population centers outside the
continental US within a few minutes of nuclear conflict. It is important
to recognize that this technical capacity to deliver overwhelming
violence to any part of the world in mere minutes has relied on
structures of the imagination as well as on [**machines**, **threat
projections**, and **fantasies**]{.mark}, as well as physics and
engineering]{.underline}.

[The above-mentioned refusal to buy milk bottled in non-reusable glass
may help to clarify the suggestion that tactical manifestations of human
agency are not bound by spatial dynamics. The consumer who changes
his/her shopping habits engages in a tactical action that escapes the
spatial controlling mechanisms of established political and economic
boundaries. The effect of such a tactical action is not limited to the
localized target, say, the supermarket. Over an extended period of time,
and in conjunction with similar actions, such tactical dissent may
affect practices of production, trade, investment, advertisement and the
like]{.underline}. The manifestations that issue from such actions
operate along an indeterminate trajectory insofar as they promote a slow
transformation of values whose effects transgress places and become
visible and effective only by maturation over time. In the case of
tactical protest actions of environmentally sensitive consumers, it may
still be too early to ascertain a definitive manifestation of human
agency. However, various indicators render such an assertion highly
likely. [Changing attitudes and consumption patters, including an
increasing concern for environmental issues, have produced easily
recognizable marketing shifts in most parts of the industrial world. For
instance, health food sections are now a common feature in most
supermarkets. And there is empirical evidence that suggests that
consumer preferences for costly \'ethical\' production technologies can
lead to increased competition between producers, which, in turn, may
gradually increase the level of adoption of such ethical technology (Noe
and Rebello, 1995, 69-85). Conclusion The task of articulating a
discursive notion of human agency towered at the entrance of this essay
and has never ceased to be its main puzzle, a cyclically reoccurring
dilemma. How can we understand and conceptualize the processes through
which people shape social and political life. Where is this fine line
between essentialism and relativism, between suffocating in the narrow
grip of totalizing knowledge claims and blindly roaming in a nihilistic
world of absences?]{.underline} How to make a clear break with
positivist forms of representing the political without either abandoning
the concept of human agency or falling back into a new form of
essentialism? Confronting the difficulties that arise with this
dualistic dilemma, I have sought to advance a positive concept of human
agency that is neither grounded in a stable essence nor dependent upon a
presupposed notion of the subject. The ensuing journey has taken me,
painted in very broad strokes, along the following circular trajectory
of revealing and concealing: discourses are powerful forms of
domination. They frame the parameters of thinking processes. They shape
political and social interactions. [Yet, discourses are not invincible.
They may be thin. They may contain cracks. By moving the gaze from
epistemological to ontological spheres, one can explore ways in which
individuals use these cracks to escape aspects of the discursive
order.]{.underline} [To recognize the potential for human agency that
opens up as a result of this process, one needs to shift foci again,
this time from concerns with Being to an inquiry into tactical
behaviours. Moving between various hyphenated identities, individuals
use ensuing mobile subjectivities to engage in daily acts of dissent,
which gradually transform societal values. Over an extended period of
time, such tactical expressions of human agency gradually transform
societal values. By returning to epistemological levels, one can then
conceptualize how these transformed discursive practices engender
processes of social change.]{.underline} I have used everyday forms of
resistance to illustrate how discourses not only frame and subjugate our
thoughts and behaviour, but also offer possibilities for human agency.
Needless to say, discursive dissent is not the only practice of
resistance that can exert human agency. There are many political actions
that seek immediate changes in policy or institutional structures,
rather than \'mere\' shifts in societal consciousness. Although some of
these actions undoubtedly achieve results, they are often not as potent
as they seem. Or, rather, their enduring effect may well be primarily
discursive, rather than institutional. Nietzsche (1982b, 243) already
knew that the greatest events \'are not our loudest but our stillest
hours.\' This is why he stressed that the world revolves \'not around
the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new values.\'
And this is why, for Foucault too, the crucial site for political
investigations are not institutions, even though they are often the
place where power is inscribed and crystallized. [The fundamental point
of anchorage of power relations, Foucault claims, is always located
outside institutions, deeply entrenched within the social nexus. Hence,
instead of looking at power from the vantage point of institutions, one
must analyse institutions from the standpoint of power relations
(Foucault, 1982, 219-222). A defence of human agency through a
Nietzschean approach does inevitably leave some observers unsatisfied
\-- desiring a more robust account of what constitutes human actions and
their influence on political and social life.]{.underline} However, a
more firm and detailed theory of agency is unlikely to achieve more than
essentialize a particular and necessarily subjective viewpoint on the
political. Needed, instead, is what William Connolly has termed an ethos
of critical responsiveness \-- that is, an openness towards the unknown,
unseen, unthought and a resulting effort to accept and theorize our
limits to cognition (see Connolly, 1995, 154, and for a discussion
White, 2000, 106-150). The key, then is to turn this inevitable
ambiguity into a positive and enabling force, rather than a threat that
needs to be warded off or suppressed at all cost. The present essay has
sought to demonstrate how such an attitude towards human agency is
possible, and indeed necessary, in both theory and practice. [In the
domain of political practice, everyday forms of resistance demonstrate
that transformative potential is hidden in the very acceptance of
ambiguity. Consider the countless and continuously spreading new social
movements, pressure groups and other loose organizations that challenge
various aspects of local, national or global governance. These movements
operate in a rather chaotic way. They come and go. They are neither
centrally controlled nor do they all seek the same objective. Some
operate on the right end of the political spectrum. Others on the left.
Some oppose globalization. Others hail it. Some seek more environmental
regulations. Others defend neo-liberal free trade. And, it is precisely
through this lack of coherence, control and certainty that the
respective resistance movements offer a positive contribution to the
political. They are in some sense the quintessential aspect of
postmodern politics, of local resistance to metanarrative
impositions]{.underline} (see White, 1991, 10-12; Walker, 1988). They
embody what Connolly (1995, 154-155) believes is the key to cultural
democratization: a certain level of \'productive ambiguity,\' that is,
the commitment always to resist \'attempts to allow one side or the
other to achieve final victory.\' Ensuing forms of human agency,
anarchical as they may be, thus generate regular and important public
scrutiny and discussion of how norms, values and institutions function.

[The fourth and \"final\" phase of the American culture industry\'s
renarrativization of the Vietnam War was inaugurated on the concurrent
occasion of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the United States\'s
surgically executed \"victory\" against Saddam Hussein in the Gulf
War.]{.underline} [What is especially telling about the official
representation of this historical conjuncture, especially by the
television networks, is that, from beginning to end, it was this
contrasting negative measure of Vietnam that utterly determined its
narrative shape: the linear/circular structure of decisive victory. From
the inaugural debates about the question of the legitimacy of America\'s
intervention in the face of Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait through the brief
period of the war itself to its immediate aftermath, it was the specter
of the Vietnam War --- the \"divisive\" and \"self-defeating\" national
anxiety precipitated by its radical indeterminacy--- that the narrative
structure of closure, enabled by a \"victory\" by the United States in
the Cold War, was intended to decisively efface.]{.underline} This
transformation of a national anxiety into a productive negative image
was symptomatically reflected by President Bush\'s virtually
unchallenged guarantee to the American public on [the eve of the war
that it would not be \"another Vietnam]{.underline}\"26 and, more
strategically, by the exclusive mediation of the events of the Gulf War
by the American military information agencies in a way that the events
of the Vietnam War had made unthinkable. And it was the long process of
cultural forgetting, which had ostensibly (re)constituted the actual
defeat of the United States into a drastically mistaken withdrawal from
Vietnam, that had prepared the ground for this cultural transformation[.
In short, the representational forgetting of the actualities of the war
systematically undertaken by the ideological state apparatuses had
gradually arrived at a form of remembering it that attributed the defeat
of America to the infectious impact of the multisituated protest
movement in the United States on the American public and its
intellectual deputies. In this \"final\" phase, that]{.underline} is,
the earlier public need to \"heal the wound\" --- a recuperative and
conciliatory gesture of forgetting --- [became, in the words of
President George Bush and official Washington, a matter of \"kicking the
Vietnam syndrome.\"27]{.underline} Aided and abetted by the culture
industry, this early gesture of forgetting metamorphosed at the time of
the Gulf \"crisis\" into a virulently assured assumption that the
resistance to America\'s intervention and conduct of the war in Vietnam
in the 1960s was a symptom of a national neurosis. (This interpretation
of the active resistance to the Vietnam War was not a sudden reactionary
political initiative enabled by the circumstances of the Gulf War[. Its
origins can be traced back to the period of the Vietnam War itself, to
the reaction against the protest movement by such influential
conservative and liberal humanist intellectuals]{.underline} as George
Kennan, Walter Jackson Bate, and Allan Bloom, among many others. [The
disruptions of the traditional white Anglo-American and male-dominated
cultural value system in American colleges and universities --- whether
in the form of the common body of shared knowledge informing the general
education program \[the litterae humaniores\] or the canon of great
books]{.underline} --- were undertaken in the name of relevance. In the
name of high seriousness, these anxious traditionalists reduced this
emancipatory initiative to an unhealthy or neurotic obsession with
novelty and/or vulgarity and represented it --- as Arnold had
represented the rise of working-class consciousness in late Victorian
Britain --- [as a symptom not simply of a \"centrifugal\" process
precipitating a dangerous cultural \"heterogeneity,\" but as a
collective \"death wish\" \[Bate\] on the part of the American
academy.)28 Whatever its limitations, the protest movement in the
Vietnam decade was, in fact, a symptomatic manifestation of a
long-overdue and promising national self-doubt about the alleged
legitimacy of America\'s representation of its internal constituencies
(blacks, women, gays, ethnic minorities, the poor, the young, and so on)
and about the alleged benignity of its historically ordained
exceptionalist mission to transform the world (the barbarous Others) in
its own image.]{.underline} In this last phase of the amnesiac process,
this healthy and potentially productive self-examination of the American
cultural identity came to be represented as a collective psychological
sickness that, in its disintegrative momentum, threatened to undermine
\"America\'s\" promised end.29 By this I mean the end providentially
promised to the original Puritans and later, after the secularization of
the body politic, by History: the building of \"the city on the hill\"
in the \"New World,\" which is to say, the advent of the New World Order
and the end of history. [In the wake of the Cold War, and especially the
defeat of Saddam Hussein\'s army --- and the consequent representation
of the shattered American consensus occasioned by the Vietnam War as a
recovery of a collective mental illness ---]{.underline} there came in
rapid and virtually unchallenged succession a floodtide of \"reforms,\"
reactionary in essence, intended to annul the multiply situated
progressive legacy of the protest movement(s) of the Vietnam decade by
overt abrogation or accommodation. [Undertaken in the name of the
\"promise\" of \"America,\" these reforms were intended to reestablish
the ontological, cultural, and political authority of the enlightened,
American \"vital center\" and its circumference and thus to recontain
the dark force of the insurgent differential constituencies that had
emerged at the margins in the wake of the disclosures of the Vietnam
War]{.underline}. At the domestic site, these included the coalescence
of capital (the Republican Party) and the religious and political Right
into a powerful dominant neoconservative culture (a new \"Holy
Alliance,\" as it were) committed to an indissolubly linked militantly
racist, antifeminist, antigay, and anti-working-class agenda; [the
dominant liberal humanist culture\'s massive indictment of
deconstructive and destructive theory as complicitous with fascist
totalitarianism; the nationwide legislative assault on the post-Vietnam
public university by way of programs of economic retrenchment affiliated
with the representation of its multicultural initiative as a political
correctness of the Left]{.underline};30 the increasing subsumption of
the various agencies of cultural production and dissemination (most
significantly, the electronic information highways) under fewer and
fewer parent, mostly American, corporations; the dismantling of the
welfare program; and, symptomatically, the rehabilitation of the
criminal president, Richard Nixon. At the international site, this
\"reformist\" initiative has manifested itself as the rehabilitation of
the American errand in the world, a rehabilitation exemplified by the
United States\'s virtually uncontested moral/military interventions in
Panama, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, the Middle East, and Kosovo; its
interference in the political processes of Russia by way of providing
massive economic support for Boris Yeltsin\'s democratic/capitalist
agenda against the communist opposition; its unilateral assumption of
the lead in demanding economic/political reforms in Southeast Asian
countries following the collapse of their economies in 1998; its
internationalization of the \"free market\"; and, not least, its
globalization of the instrumentalist version of the English language.
[What needs to be foregrounded is that these global post-Cold War
\"reformist\" initiatives are not discontinuous practices, a matter of
historical accident. Largely enabled by the \"forgetting\" of Vietnam
--- and of the repression or accommodation or self-immolation of the
emergent decentered modes of thinking the Vietnam War precipitated ---
they are, rather, indissolubly, however unevenly, related. Indeed, they
are the multisituated practical consequences of the planetary triumph
(the \"end\") of the logical economy of the imperial ontological
discourse that has its origins in the founding of the idea of the
Occident and its fulfilled end in the banal instrumental/technological
reasoning in the discourse of \"America.\" In thus totally colonizing
thinking, that is, this imperial \"Americanism\" has come to determine
the comportment toward being of human beings, in all their individual
and collective differences, at large --- even of those postcolonials who
would resist its imperial order]{.underline}. This state of thinking,
which has come to be called the New World Order (though to render its
rise to ascendancy visible requires reconstellating the Vietnam War into
this history), subsumes the representative, but by no means complete,
list of post-Cold War practices to which I have referred above. And it
is synecdochically represented by the massive mediatization of the
amnesiac end-of-history discourse and the affiliated polyvalent rhetoric
of the Pax Americana[. Understood in terms of this massive effort to
endow hegemonic status to the transformation of the metaphorics of the
\"wound\" to (neurotic) \"syndrome,\" the forgotten of the systematic
process of forgetting apparently accomplished by the renarrativization
of history since the humiliatingly visible fall of Saigon in 1975 takes
on a spectral resonance of epochal and planetary
significance.]{.underline} As such, it calls on the differential
community of oppositional intellectuals to undertake a genealogy of this
end-of-history discourse that would retrieve (wiederholen\] as precisely
as possible the essence of that which the United States\'s intervention
in Vietnam and its conduct of the war disclosed, that which the American
Cultural Memory, in the form of a \"new Holy Alliance,\" has feverishly
attempted to bury in oblivion by way of its multisituated and long-term
labor to hegemonize a demonic representation of this (self-)disclosure.

But to speak of the circular space perceived by the Eurocentric eye of
the Enlightenment as an unknown, unnamed, and unimproved space that
\"demands\" to be known, named, and improved is to realize that the
civilizing or enlightening mission of the Enlightenment also requires
specification both of the articulation of that space and of the effects
of that spatial economy on knowledge and power. [To put it generally,
the Eurocentric solar or panoptic eye of the Enlightenment turned the
earlier \"emptiness\" of the circle of its vision into a measurable
space. Whereas the imperial eye of the pre-Enlightenment --- the early
Spanish conquistadores, for example --- tended to (over)see the circle
it projected as a generalized amorphous and thus immediately plunderable
space, the Enlightenment eye came to oversee the (always expanding)
circle it projected as a mappable organic space]{.underline}, a vital
differential world in which the comparative knowledge of its details
enhances the power of the encompassing eye of the beholder over its
organic \"branching.\" As his presiding analogy between the domain of
knowledge and the geographical world clearly suggests, what the French
philosophe D\'Alembert says in 1751 about the domain of knowledge before
and after the emergence of the mapping eye in his Preliminary Discourse
to the Encyclopedia of Diderot applies as well to the relationship
between the Enlightenment Metropolis and the provinces. [Indeed, it
applies right down to the roles that \"travelers\'\" narratives and the
ensuing opening of lines of communication to the Metropolis play in the
process of mastering the labyrinthine Other]{.underline}: The execution
\[\"of a genealogical or encyclopedic tree which will gather the various
branches of knowledge together under a single point of view\"\] is not
without difficulty\... .The general system of the sciences and the arts
is a sort of labyrinth, a torturous road which the intellect enters
without quite knowing what direction to take\.... The discontinuity of
these operations is a necessary effect of the very generation of ideas.
However philosophic this disorder may be on the part of the soul, an
encyclopedic tree which attempted to portray it would be disfigured,
indeed utterly destroyed\.... It is not the same with the encyclopedic
arrangement of our knowledge. [This consists of collecting knowledge
into the smallest area possible and of placing the philosopher at a
vantage point, so to speak, high above the vast labyrinth, whence he can
perceive the principal sciences and the arts simultaneously. From there
he can see at a glance the objects of their speculations and the
operations which can be made on these objects; he can discern the
general branches of human knowledge, the points that separate or unite
them; and sometimes he can even glimpse the secrets that related them to
one another]{.underline}. It is a kind of world map which is to show the
principal countries, their position and their mutual dependence, the
road that leads directly from one to another[. This road is often cut by
a thousand obstacles, which are known in each country only to the
inhabitants or to travelers, and which cannot be represented except in
individual, highly detailed maps.]{.underline} These individual maps
will be the different articles of the Encyclopedia and the Tree or
Systematic Chart will be its world map.80 The difference between the two
historical moments, in other words, is the difference between a mapped
space understood, as in the case of the early European explorers, as a
periplum (\"not as land seen on a map/but sea bord seen by men
sailing\"),81 and a mapped space conceived, as Foucault has shown, as a
self-consciously mediative mode of knowledge/power production analogous
in its structure to, if not entirely dependent on, the \"tables\" based
on the ontologically, invariably racially, grounded systems of
classification that emerged in the Enlightenment. These were the
polyvalent taxonomic tables --- best exemplified by the Systema Naturae
(1735), Philosophia Botanica (1751), and Species Plantarum (1753) of
Linnaeus, the Histoire naturelle (1749) of Buffon, the Nosologie
methodique (1772) of Boissier de Sauvages (\"the Linnaeus of
diseases\"),82 and the Families des plantes (1763) of Michel Adanson83
--- [that differentiated, named, graded, and accommodated an amorphous
organic multiplicity within an inclusive structure that miniaturizes and
renders visible a larger, otherwise invisible, and \"ungraspable\"
totality. As such, they became the disciplinary model for the classroom,
the mass production factory, the penal institution, the medical clinic,
the psychiatric hospital, the capitalist system of economic exchange,
and the practice of military warfare in the \"disciplinary
society\":]{.underline} The first of the great operations of discipline
is\... the constitution of \"tableaux vivants,\" which transform the
confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplicities.
The drawing up of \"tables\" was one of the great problems of the
scientific, political and economic technology of the eighteenth century:
how one was to arrange botanical and zoological gardens, and construct
at the same time rational classifications of living beings; [how one was
to observe, supervise, regularize the circulation of commodities and
money and thus build up an economic table that might serve as the
principle of the increase of wealth; how one was to inspect men, observe
their presence and absence and constitute a general and permanent
register of the armed forces; how one was to distribute patients,
separate them from one another, divide up the hospital space and make a
systematic classification of diseases: these were all twin operations in
which the two elements]{.underline} --- distribution and analysis,
supervision and intelligibility --- are inextricably bound up. In the
eighteenth century the table was both a technique of power and a
procedure of knowledge. [It was a question of organizing the multiple,
of providing oneself with an instrument to cover it and to master it; it
was a question of imposing upon it an \"order.\"84 To these
differentiated dedifferentiated (accommodational) \"imperial\"
structures produced by the miniaturization and spatialization of time
should be added the reduction and hierarchized structuration of
languages, of gender and race relations, and, not least, of the
discourse and practice --- the visualization or re-presentation and
administration of --- the nation-state and the colonial
empire.]{.underline}

The \"mission\" of the American Mission in Saigon was from the beginning
of the United States\'s involvement in Vietnam exceptionalist. [Its
self-ordained responsibility was to \"win the hearts and minds\" of the
postcolonial Vietnamese to the self-evident truth principles of \"the
(always new) free world\" in the face of their profound contempt for
European --- Old World --- imperialism.]{.underline} This representation
of the American Mission in terms of its original \"errand in the
wilderness,\" which set America off from the rapacious and decadent Old
World, is clearly suggested by the pervasive New Frontier rhetoric that
accompanied the inauguration of President Kennedy\'s administration ---
[a rhetoric integrally related to Kennedy\'s establishment of the
Special Forces, better known as the Green Berets. This was the cultural
as well as military arm that was given the motto De opresso liber (To
free the oppressed) and deployed in an advisory capacity in Vietnam with
the intention of recalling and exemplifying to the world at
large]{.underline} --- both to the Soviet Union and to a Europe
recovering from the self-inflicted catastrophe of World War II --- the
perennial pioneer spirit of \"America.\" The American Mission, that is,
represented its illegal and aggressive intervention in the civil
struggle following the decisive defeat of the French by the Viet Minh at
Dien Bien Phu in [1954 not simply by contrasting its benignly
disinterested motive to bring the principles of \"freedom\" to the
Vietnamese people with the totalitarianism of Soviet and Chinese
communism. The New Adamic American Puritans justified their colonization
of the \"New World\" by contrasting their exceptionalist errand in the
wilderness with the repressive and exploitative practices of a
spiritually decadent Europe.]{.underline} Similarly, the American
Mission in Vietnam attempted to legitimate its intervention by
insistently differentiating its democratic ethos not only from communism
but also from the decadent racist colonialism of France, the European
imperial power that had ruled and exploited the Vietnamese people for a
century before World War II and that, despite the war\'s activation of a
global anticolonialism, would continue to do so after the war. This
deeply backgrounded and resonant cultural opposition was fundamental to
the official and mediatic representation of the United States\'s
involvement in Vietnam from the beginning of this involvement in the
aftermath of the Geneva Convention. The testimony of the foreign policy
of the Eisenhower administration and, not least, of such nationally
popular Cold War and anti-Old World texts as Dr. Tom Dooley\'s memoirs
Deliver Us from Evil (1956) and Eugene Burdick\'s and William Lederer\'s
The Ugly American (1958) bears witness to this, the former, in
apotheosizing by enacting the noble American frontier spirit in Vietnam,
and the latter, in castigating the America mission in Southeast Asia for
having abandoning it[. But it was the English novelist Graham Greene who
disclosed the (neo)imperial significance of this exceptionalist ideology
in The Quiet American (1955), a novel that, predictably, was condemned
in the United States as a reactionary affirmation of the anachronous Old
World ethos, more specifically, as \" \'an exercise in national
projection\' by a member of the British Empire history had passed
by.]{.underline}\"35 [Graham Greene\'s development of the exceptionalist
cultural motif is integrally related to his satiric critique of the
murderously innocent intentions of Alden Pyle (Greene\'s fictionalized
version of the legendary American counterinsurgency figure Colonel
Edward Lansdale, whose task was to develop a native \"Third Force\" in
Vietnam that was neither French colonialist nor communist).]{.underline}
And it is epitomized by the following conversation between Greene\'s
narrator, Fowler, the cynical and not entirely reliable English
reporter, who, though he condemns French colonialism, prefers it to the
colonialism that is practiced dev astatingly in the name of
anticolonialism by the United States, and \"the quiet American,\" Alden
Pyle, the unquestioning ephebe of the influential American Asian expert
(we would now, in the wake of Edward Said\'s great book, call him an
\"Orientalist\") York Harding, whose \"objective\" analysis of
America\'s mission in the world, Greene implies, is utterly determined
by the Cold War scenario. [They have been caught in a tower manned by
two young and frightened French Vietnamese soldiers at nightfall on
their return to Saigon from a Caodaist festival at which Fowler
accidentally learns that Pyle is secretly contacting a certain General
The, the leader of this \"Third Force,\" in behalf of the American
Mission: \"You and your like are trying to make a war with the help of
people who just aren\'t interested.\" \"They don\'t want Communism.\"
\"They want enough rice,\" I said. \"They don\'t want to be shot
at.]{.underline} [They want one day to be much the same as another. They
don\'t want our white skins around telling them what they want.\" \"If
Indo-China goes\...\" \"I know the record. Siam goes, Malaya goes.
Indonesia goes. What does \'go\' mean?\...\"]{.underline} \"[They\'ll be
forced to believe what they are told, they won\'t be allowed to think
for themselves]{.underline}.\" \"Thought\'s a luxury. Do you think the
peasant sits and thinks of God and Democracy when he gets inside his mud
hut at night?\" \"You talk as if the whole country were peasant. What
about the educated? Are they going to be happy?\" \"Oh no,\" I said,
\"we\'v[e brought them up in our ideas. We\'ve taught them dangerous
games, and that\'s why we are sitting here, hoping we don\'t get our
throats cut.]{.underline} We deserve to have them cut. I wish your
friend York was here too. I wonder how he\'d relish it.\" \"York
Harding\'s a very courageous man. Why, in Korea \...\" \"He wasn\'t an
enlisted man, was he? He had a return ticket These poor devils can\'t
catch a plane home. Hi,\" I called to them, \"what are your names?\"
\... They didn\'t answer\"They think we are French,\" I said. \"That\'s
just it,\" Pyle said. \"[You shouldn\'t be against York, you should be
against the French. Their colonialism]{.underline}.\"36 If the
ameliorative benignity of America\'s exceptionalist errand that
differentiated it from the imperial rapacity of the Old World was
selfevident to the American Mission, it was not to an Oriental people
deeply rooted in another, radically different, culture. [This
indifference and/or resistance to the American Mission\'s effort to win
the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese precipitated an American reaction
that has been well documented, but the crucial significance of which has
not adequately been understood and thematized by the historians of the
Vietnam War. The refusal of their assent to these \"self-evident\" New
World truths instigated an American practice that, however reluctantly,
was characterized by the increasing visibility of the will to power
informing the benign truth discourse of liberal democracy]{.underline}.
To adapt Jacques Derrida\'s rhetoric to my purposes, it compelled the
\"center elsewhere\" of the American Mission\'s freedom discourse, which
is normally \"beyond the reach of free play,\" down into the visible
arena of the free play of criticism.37 The \"first\" symptom of this
\"contradiction\" was, of course, the American Mission\'s violent
remapping of Vietnam --- its representation of this single ancient
culture as two distinct countries --- and then the imposition, or,
rather, the recurrent imposition, of a \"legitimate\" government in
South Vietnam (the \"Third Force,\" in the language of the Cold War
scenario) that was represented as being \"committed\" to the
\"disinterested\" discourse and practice of liberal democracy.

[The response of the American Mission to the \"de-structive\" strategy
of the elusive Vietnamese Other was not to readjust its \"European\"
military tactics of decidability to a kind of warfare in which the
spectral enemy was always hauntingly invisible and unknowable, in which,
in other words, the differential Other refused to obey the Western rules
of warfare.]{.underline} The American Mission, that is to say --- and it
is important to emphasize this --- did not reorient its Western
logocentric concept of war in the face of an enemy that refused to
answer to the fundamental epistemic imperatives of the European
Enlightenment: those emanating from the grounding principle of
differentiation (within a larger identical structure). I mean by this
last[, the knowledge-producing disciplinary table (uniforms, insignia,
rank, and so on) that would distinguish soldiers from civilians (and
women and children) and its linear/circular imperial tactical geometries
that would render the enemy\'s moves locatable, predictable, and
masterable.]{.underline} On the contrary, [the American
response]{.underline} to these unexpected and psychologically and
practically baffling conditions precipitated by the enemy\'s refusal to
adhere to the structural imperatives of the hitherto self-evident
liberal democratic narrative [was --- predictably ---
reactive]{.underline}. As is well known (despite the official effort to
repress this knowledge), the Pentagon managers and the American Mission
in Saigon simply substituted one European form of warfare for another,
the frontal assault that would end in the decisive battle for a war of
attrition. [The \"body count,\" it was hoped, would eventually deplete
the spectral numbers of the Vietnamese Other\'s army to --- in a telling
locution --- the point of no return]{.underline}. True to this
unrelenting American will to convert the spectral to verifiable numbers
(tabulation), this technologization (and routinizing) of death ---
Caputo refers to his soul-destroying duties as \"Regimental Casualty
Reporting Officer\" as keeping \"Wheeler\'s \[his commanding
officer\'s\] Scoreboard\" (RV\^ 159)51 ---the American Mission
retaliated by unleashing a technological firepower against the
recalcitrantly invisible and undifferentiated Other unprecedented in
(nonatomic) military history: [We took space back quickly, expensively,
with total panic and close to maximum brutality. Our machine was
devastating. And versatile. It could do everything but stop. As one
American major said, in a successful attempt at attaining history, \"We
had to destroy Ben Tre in order to save it.\"52 It was, if we recall the
testimony of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal of
1968 in Stockholm, a firepower that, in the scope, violence, and, above
all, the necessary indiscriminateness of its application, bordered on
genocide]{.underline}.53 [When this indiscriminate violence against the
Vietnamese people and their earth at large became inescapably visible to
the American public, a significant --- and still to be adequately
questioned --- transformation of the representation of America\'s
involvement in Vietnam began to manifest itself in the hegemonic
discourse of the culture industry and in that of many government
officials and intellectuals who had hitherto supported or had acquiesced
to it, a transformation that eventually aligned itself with that of the
prominent antiwar spokespersons.]{.underline} The brutal conduct of the
war came increasingly to be represented as a political betrayal of the
principles of liberal democracy. [As I have been suggesting in
demonstrating the impossibility of differentiating the ontological
representation and the military practice of America in Vietnam, it is of
crucial importance to remark about this turn that the genocidal ---
leveling---as sault on the Vietnamese people was not simply a military
violence aimed at achieving an economic/political objective. It was also
and indissolubly a violence at the sites of ontology and culture, not to
say of race and gender.]{.underline} The ugly justification by General
Mark Clark, one of the great American commanders of World War II, for
the obliterative B-52 bombings of North Vietnam in 1968 was no accident:
\"I don\'t think it\'s necessary to have an invasion of North Vietnam.
And it would be just exactly what the enemy wants. He\'d like us to put
down 100,000 men in the field. He\'d put down 100,000. They\'re willing
to lose half of theirs, and ours is a precious commodity. [And I
wouldn\'t trade one dead American for 50 dead Chinamen]{.underline}.\"54
(It is beyond the scope of this chapter to apply Clark\'s racist logic
to the demographics of death within the American military body. [Given
the obvious fact that proportionately far more blacks than whites were
fighting \"Chinamen\" in Vietnam, one is compelled to ask whether the
dominant culture that Clark represents believed that the black man was,
in the general\'s typically \"American\" rhetoric, as precious a
commodity as his white counterpart]{.underline}.)

If the [genealogy of the triumphalist imperial thinking]{.underline} I
have undertaken in this chapter [teaches us]{.underline} anything at
all, it is [to take this telling \"qualification\" of the end-of-history
discourse seriously. Doing so puts one in a position to perceive not
only the inordinately persuasive power of this kind of
contradiction-defying \"technological\" thinking, but also its
weakness]{.underline}, a weakness [that up to now has been obscured by
oppositional discourses that contradictorily think resistance in the
logic prescribed by the dominant thought of the Enlightenment, the very
thought they would oppose]{.underline}. If, indeed, the highly prized
Western consciousness as such is a technological optical machine of
conquest, if the Western will to know is simultaneously a will to total
power, if the Western subject in fact defines itself as \"I think;
therefore I conquer,\" and if it is this imperial ocularcentric Western
mode of thinking that has gained complete discursive dominion over the
planet, then surely [in this interregnum the time has come for those who
would effectively resist the practical fulfillment of the Pax
Metaphysica as the Pax Americana to return to the site of ontology as
point of departure]{.underline}. I mean the site of Heidegger\'s
de-struction and of the deconstruction of those like Derrida, Levinas,
Lyotard, Lacoue-Labarthe, Nancy, and others whose thought --- even their
critique of Heidegger\'s --- Heidegger\'s catalyzed. [In thus calling
for such a **\"step back,\"** I am not positing the ontological in
opposition to the other more \"political\" sites that,]{.underline}
admittedly, [these thinkers originally neglected or
rarefied]{.underline}. I am suggesting, rather, that [the \"triumphant\"
liberal/capitalist democratic culture\'s overdetermination of the
\"truth\"]{.underline} (the correspondence of mind and thing) [in
justifying its \"triumph\" has rendered a rigorous analysis of the
ontological ground]{.underline} of this imperial truth [an imperative of
political resistance against]{.underline} the New World Order, [the Pax
Americana, that would follow this Pax Metaphysica.]{.underline} I mean
an analysis such as that inaugurated in the postVietnam decade by these
\"postmetaphysical\" thinkers, but this time reconstellated into the
context of the global imperial politics enabled by metaphysical thinking
in its fulfilled technological/instrumental phase. Far from being
identifiable as totalitarian in tendency or simply obsolete, as so many
New Historicist, neo-Marxist, cultural, and postcolonial critics have
all-too-hastily concluded, [these postmetaphysical or postlogocentric or
postocularcentric discourses imply **recognition not only of the global
triumph of the imperialist thought they would oppose.**]{.underline}
Equally important, [they constitute inaugural efforts, precipitated by
the very planetary technologization --- that is, colonization --- of
thought, to think thinking differently or]{.underline}, rather,
[differentially]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline}, that is,
[symptomatic manifestations of the contradictions ---]{.underline} the
subverting or decolonizing Other --- [that the \"fulfillment\" and
global \"triumph\" of metaphysical though]{.underline}t, like the end of
philosophy, according to Heidegger\'s quite different reading of
modernity, [necessarily precipitate at its limits. They
are]{.underline}, to put it in Heidegger\'s terms, [symptomatic gestures
of the]{.underline} Abgeschiedene, the [\"ghostly\" wandering stranger,
who,]{.underline} aware of the global colonization of originative
thinking by the total instrumentalization and banalization of
\"enlightening\" thought, [has parted from the solar
\"at-homeland,\"]{.underline} [but whose very spectral nonbeing haunts
the \"victorious\" culture of the \"age of the world
picture.\"]{.underline} 102 As such, [these]{.underline}
[postmetaphysical (or postocularcentric) efforts to think differentially
are]{.underline}, not accidentally, [analogous to]{.underline}, indeed
--- however asymmetrically --- indissolubly continuous with, [the
potentially subversive or decolonizing political resistance to the
polyvalent Occidental (neo)colonialism inherent in the various
constituencies of the human community that have been unhomed by the
planetary fulfillment of the \"promise\" of the original, metaphysically
justified imperial project]{.underline}. I am [not only referring to the
potential resistance of those highly civilized \"barbarian\"
beings]{.underline} on the dark periphery who, according to Dussel, are
invisible to and thus deprived of being by the enlightened metaphysical
eye of the Apollonian Occident [and]{.underline}, as such, [have indeed
become the menacing spectral \"threat\" it named them in order to
justify its colonization and exploitation of their being]{.underline}:
Against the classic ontology of the center, from Hegel to Marcuse --- to
name the most brilliant from Europe and North America [--- a philosophy
of liberation is rising from the periphery, from the oppressed, from the
shadow that the light of Being has not been able to
illumine]{.underline}. **[Our thought sets out from non-being,
nothingness, otherness, exteriority, the mystery of
no-sense.]{.underline}** It is, then, a \"barbarian\" philosophy. [I am
also]{.underline}, and above all, [referring to the subversive potential
inhering in that massive and various population of displaced persons
who]{.underline}, in a resonant irony that needs to be marked, [have
been compelled by the global depredations of Western colonialism to
revert]{.underline} --- but in a relatively knowing way --- [to that
\"barbarian\" nomadic condition that \"justified\" the West\'s
appropriation of their land and its civilizing project]{.underline}.
For, like the symptomatic thinking of the antimetaphysical thinkers I
have invoked, [these de-territorialized postcolonial
others]{.underline}-of the-Occident, precisely because of their
compelled apartness --- their mobile and unassimilated status --- [have
no reason to be answerable to the truth and practice of imperialism and
thus exist in their \"nonbeing\" as specters that symptomatically haunt
the hegemony of the imperial culture]{.underline}. It will be the
purpose of the final chapter of this book to reconstellate the
postmodern antimetaphysical initiative into the context of the politics
of the postcolonial occasion. More specifically, it [will attempt to
think in a prologomenal way the positive possibilities for resistance
inhering in the relationship between the spectral ontological
contradiction precipitated by the fulfillment]{.underline} (the coming
to its end) [of the logical economy of Western metaphysics in the age of
the world picture and the spectral political contradiction]{.underline}
(the postcolonial other-of-theOccident) precipitated by the fulfillment
of the Western imperial project in the \"New World Order.\"
[This]{.underline}, I will claim, **[is the final imperative of thinking
the meta of Western metaphysics.]{.underline}**

[Given this utterly reduced condition of thinking, the \"ends of man\"
thus points to the (self)dis-closure of that spectral force field of
differences that the \"truth\" of the age of the world picture cannot
finally contain within its imperial circumference]{.underline}. The
moment that the structuralist logic of the discourse of modern
anthropology reaches its limits --- achieves closure --- means, finally,
the delegitimation of the (\"disinterested\" or \"objective\") truth
discourse of Occidental humanism. [This, it must be remembered, is the
post-Enlightenment \"anthropology\" that, under the allotropic names of
\"the free world\" or \"liberal \[American\] democracy,\" has come to be
represented in the aftermath of the Cold War and the \"kicking of the
Vietnam syndrome\" as \"the end of history\" by the spokespersons of
\"America.\" In the face of this triumphalist ontological representation
of the contemporary occasion --- which is to say, this astonishingly
amnesiac historical memory --- would not a \"postcolonial\" opposition
be better served by discarding the worn-out, ontologically empty word
\"postmodernism\"?]{.underline} Would it not, further, be preferable to
undertake the postcolonial project by thinking the dangerous political
occasion called \"the New World Order\" in the resonant spectral terms
recalled by Derrida\'s early effort to think the \"ends of man\" in the
context of the Vietnam War? [This, at any rate, is the suggestive
oppositional project Derrida proposes in Specters of Marx, his most
recent and most political repetition of the \"Heideggerian\" effort of
ontological retrieval, in the wake of the dominant liberal/capitalist
culture\'s proclamation at the end of the Cold War of the death and
burial of Marx and its euphoric announcement of the \"gospel,\" \"the
good news\" that has been brought into being by the dialectical labor of
History in the \"fullness of time]{.underline}.\"22 And, as I have
suggested by pointing to its affiliation with Said\'s invocation of the
political emigre, it is a proposal that demands urgent attention.
Indeed, it is the imperative of thinking in the interregnum, given the
apparent indifference of postmodern/postcolonial criticism, [which
restricts its understanding of the new globalism to the untethered flow
of transnational capital, to this other, equally pervasive, nationalist
globalism, which represents the present post-Cold War moment not simply
as the end of History, but as the triumph of \"America\" as well. If, as
I have suggested, this alleged \"good news\" is understood, as I think
it should be, as the triumphant annunciation of a fully realized
imperial and banalizing project of thinking, of an \"advent,\" as it
were (the Pax Metaphysica), as well as the completed imperial and
banalizing project of sociopolitics (the Pax Americana), then it becomes
the task of a \"postcolonial\" opposition not simply to retrieve the
differential event that the announcement of \"good news\" has had to
obliterate in order to legitimize the planetary truth of liberal
capitalist democracy.]{.underline} (It should not be overlooked that
this end-of-history discourse repeats in thought the violence in
practice to which the American officer in Vietnam synecdochically
referred when he declared that \"\[w\]e had to destroy Ben Tre in order
to save it.\")23 [It also becomes a postcolonial opposition\'s task to
think that repressed event in terms of the implications of its
persistent and anxiety-provoking spectral afterlife for a way of
thinking capable of disarticulating or molecularizing the inordinate
positive power of the triumphant imperial discourse.]{.underline} It has
not been my purpose in this book to undertake this rethinking of
thinking, though I want to emphasize that what I have said in the
preceding chapters makes it clear that this initiative would benefit by
attuning itself to the de-structive (or decentering) project Heidegger
inaugurated in Being and Time in the wake of the forgetting of the
Seinsfrage (which is to say, of the closure of philosophy) and that
Derrida and Foucault, in different ways, extended and modified.
[Finally, however, it is not so much to theory as such that the project
to rethink thinking in the interregnum must look as it is to the
violence of the history of the Occidental thought and practice I have
retrieved.]{.underline} This history, bathed in innocent blood,
emphatically suggests that such a thinking must take its point of
departure from the self-de-struction of the discourse of Man in the
Vietnam War --- the event that synecdochically and decisively disclosed
not only the essential complicity of Occidental thought with imperial
practice, but also the essential affiliation between the dissemination
inhering in its Word and the diasporic consequences of the fulfillment
of its Word\'s logic. To \"repeat\" my beginning after a long detour, it
must take its positive point of departure from the negative force ---
the \"decentered\" or, in the allotropes of Edward Said and Gilles
Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the \"unhoused\" or \"deterritorialized\" or
\"diasporic\" or \"nomadic\" energies --- released into history as
haunting specters by the fulfillment of this European Word\'s reifying
or spatial, which is to say, imperial, logic. This task reflects the
poverty --- the \"damaged life\" --- of the exiled intellectual in the
interregnum. [Having learned from its fate at the hands of the colonial
regime of truth, however, such a differential/exilic thinking of the
Abgeschiedene, unlike the modes of opposition that sanguinely continue
to think in the ontological terms prescribed by the master discourse, is
not only enabled to refuse to play by the rules of its imperial logic.
It is also enabled to transform this negative condition into a positive
force of resistance. As I hope these chapters have shown, such a
strategic \"nomadic\" thinking, more than any other that is currently
available, will be adequate to the task of writing the history of the
present and, though it may in the end be the same thing, of deterring
liberal capitalist democracy and the Pax Americana. But, it needs to be
underscored, the self-de-struction of the imperial truth discourse of
the post-Enlightenment incumbent on the fulfillment of its ontologic
should not merely be thought in terms of resisting an oppressive and
banalizing tradition. For this dis-closure of its plenary circle also
and simultaneously releases pro-jective possibilities. To think
positively the spectral Other that haunts Occidental thought---\"the
shadow that the light of Being has not been able to illumine,\" in
Enrique Dussel\'s resonant formulation24 ---]{.underline} is, therefore,
to open up the possibility of a different idea of the polis from that
envisioned by the metaphysical (and Roman) West. It is, finally, to
bring into being (to liberate) the thought of a differential polity, a
polity in which the dialogue that is the essential condition of our
mortal being-with takes place not in the seductive paradisal realm to
which it has, in fact, been strategically confined by liberal democracy,
but in this unequal world, where imbalance of power --- and injustice
--- always rules.

### Alt -- Remember Vietnam

#### We must remember Vietnam and recover the ontological principles of imperialism; only then can we better orient ourselves to prevent the distinction of the "other"

[We are now, after this lengthy detour, prepared to address the question
posed earlier about the unabated persistence of the national obsession
over Vietnam long after the end of the war, indeed, after the official
announcement of the end of its end in the wake of the United States\'s
victory over the Iraqi army in 1991.1 mean the question about the
unrelenting and unassuagable anxiety that continues to afflict the
American national self]{.underline}: What, precisely, has the
post-Vietnam American cultural agenda of forgetting been trying
obsessively to forget? What, as it were, is the specter that has haunted
\"America\" since its intervention a half century ago in a people\'s war
in a Third World country in Southeast Asia[? The foregoing retrieval of
the historical specificity of the Vietnam War suggests that the answer
to this question lies precisely in the American Cultural Memory\'s
systematic (if not conspiratorial) occlusion of its historicity by
metaphorizing the actual cultural and sociopolitical effects of the war,
first in the therapeutic terms of \"healing a wound\" and later, in the
context of the end of the Cold War, of \"kicking\" a national neurosis
(the Vietnam syndrome). The retrieval of the thisness of the Vietnam
War]{.underline} from its generalization, in other words,
[suggests]{.underline} that what is at stake [in the obsessive national
effort to allay this ghost is far more ideologically important than the
belated rehabilitation of the American veteran.]{.underline} Indeed, the
ideological stakes are far more important than the recuperation of the
national (good)will (as it has been iteratively claimed by those
consensus builders who are calculatively aware of this amnesiac process)
or, for that matter, than America\'s loss of its first war (as it is
claimed by those adversarial intellectuals who would resist this
amnesiac process[). The retrieved historical context suggests, rather,
that this would-be forgotten is nothing less than the symptomatic
recognition of the abyssal aporetic space opened up in the logic of
liberal democracy by the disclosure of the necessary complicity between
the ontologically derived principles of American democracy not simply
with imperialism, but also with the violent practice of genocidal
power.]{.underline} It is a complicity that, in keeping with the
Enlightenment\'s \"repressive hypothesis,\" had heretofore been occluded
by the alleged incommensurability between the principles and the
violence. [The retrieval of the thisness of the Vietnam War suggests, in
short, that this would-be forgotten --- this spectral trace, as it were
--- is the dreadfully intolerable because culturally and politically
disabling awareness of an epistemic break. I mean a break that has
rendered the truth of the idea of \"America\" vulnerable to radical
interrogation at a moment when it is loudly representing itself as the
plenary \"end\"---the noncontradictory truth --- of History. By thus
remembering the spectral reality that the American Cultural Memory would
forget and \"naming it\" an \"epistemic break,\" I am not restricting my
critique to a constituency of the dominant culture that would employ
power overtly in the name of the self-evidently be nign principle of
\"America.\"]{.underline} I am also, and above all, pointing to the
delegitimation of an \"alternative\" --- liberal/recuperative --- [but
finally continuous critique that represents this resonantly spectral
contradiction as an accident of American history: as the consequent,
that is, either of a \"mistake\" of individual and/or national judgment
(Robert McNamara, for example) or of a political \"betrayal\" of the
positive principles of liberal American democracy]{.underline} (Senator
William Fulbright, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and Richard Rorty, for
example). By \"epistemic break[\" I mean, rather, like Foucault, the
decisive and irreversible disintegration and delegitimation of the
indissoluble relay of representational discourses --- ontological,
epistemological, cultural, sociopolitical --- that collectively, however
unevenly, constitute what a period at large assumes and represents to be
the self-evident universal truth.]{.underline} I mean specifically the
(self-)exposure of the latent obliterating violence against being --- we
are entitled now to call it \"the Ahabism\" --- informing the logical
economy of the principles of freedom and equality professed by
exceptionalist \"America\": \"America,\" that is, understood in terms of
the secularization of the Puritan errand in the wilderness in the period
of the Enlightenment (the American Revolution and the making of the
American Constitution) and its expansionist practice in the nineteenth
century in the name of Manifest Destiny.64 To appropriate Antonio
Gramsci\'s historically specific terms, I mean the self-de-struction of
the hegemonic discourse of the American cultural identity and its
radical and decisive delegitimation. Henceforth, [\"America\" will no
longer be able to repress the Other or accommodate it within its
imperial structure; the Other will always already manifest itself as a
specter that haunts the \"truth\" of \"America.\" This decisive
appearance of the spectral gaze is what I have taken and continue to
take the \"postmodern condition\" to mean --- if it is recognized that
America\'s global mission is the consequence not of its self-professed
exceptionalist status, but of its self-proclaimed assumption of the
burden of fulfilling the mission civilisatrice that Europe (the Old
World) betrayed in its decadence.]{.underline} Let me recall at this
critical conjuncture the post-Cold War Hegelian theorization of the
dominant culture\'s general representation of the end of the Cold War as
the planetary triumph of liberal capitalist democracy and the end of
history. Reconstellated into the historical context I have retrieved ---
the context that this neo-Hegelian problematic would, because of its
\"historical superfluity,\" obliterate as a \"distraction\" from \"the
larger \[completed\] pattern\" of History65 --- this post-Cold War
representation of contemporary history comes to seem remarkably hollow.
It takes on the lineaments of a kind of desperate rewriting --- or
\"airbrushing\"66 --- of history that liberal democratic Cold Warriors
always and relentlessly accused communist Cold War historians of
perpetrating. As its deletion of this epochally transformative hot
moment of the Cold War suggests, in [other words, this \"objective\"
representation of the post-Cold War global scene becomes itself, like
the monomaniacal logic that propels Captain Ahab\'s inexorable pursuit
of the white whale, the self-confirming imperial end of the
\^//-inclusive and ruthlessly repressive Cold War narrative inaugurated
at the end of World War II to contain any thought or action --- both
within and beyond America\'s borders --- resembling Marxist communism.
Or, rather, this end-of-history discourse becomes the decisive
resolution in theory of that recuperative phase of the relentlessly
undemocratic democratic Cold War narrative undertaken to pacify the
threat to the national consensus posed by the withdrawal of spontaneous
consent to the \"truth\" of \"America\" by a large constituency of
American society in response to the self-disclosure of the terrible
contradictions --- the genocidal violence --- informing the benign logic
of America\'s intervention in the Vietnam \"wilderness\" and its conduct
of the war. That is to say, this end-of-history discourse can be seen as
the fulfillment of the postwar cultural imperative \"to heal the
wound.\" But the implications of this retrieval of the terrible
specificity of the Vietnam War are not limited to the exposure of the
historical occlusions thematized by the amnesiac end-of-history
discourse. In foregrounding the inordinately important role played by
ontological representation in the renarrativization of the Cold War
after the decisive self-destruction of the discourse of \"America\"
during the decade of the Vietnam War, this retrieval also suggests why
the presently privileged oppositional discourses are inadequate to the
task of resisting the dominant culture\'s representation of the global
post-Cold War occasion as the end of history (the Pax Metaphysica\] and
the advent of the New World Order presided over by the United States:
the Pax Americana. I am referring specifically to the neo-Marxist
discourse deriving from Fredric Jameson\'s identification of
postmodernism with the cultural logic of late capitalism, to the New
Historicism, to the cultural and postcolonial criticisms that in large
part derive from the former, and to that postnational discourse,
exemplified by Bill Reading\'s, that, in attempting to overcome the
ineffectuality of these, would assume a global perspective focused on
transnational capital that represents \"America\" as obsolete. It will
be the purpose of the remaining chapters of this book to analyze the
inadequacies of these \"postmodern\" discourses to the task of resisting
the discourse of the Pax Americana and to proffer prologomemally an
alternative on the basis of this critical analysis. Here, it will
suffice to suggest that these oppositional discourses are, each in its
own particular way, blinded by their insights not only to precisely
what, in the present historical conjuncture, is strongest in the
discourse of the dominant liberal/capitalist culture of the post-Cold
War period: its justification of global power on the basis of an
ontological representation of temporal history (being) that ends in the
triumph of the cultural, social, political, and especially economic
formations that are constructed on its foundation. In failing to
perceive what is strongest in the \"triumphant\" imperial discourse of
liberal/capitalist democracy, each of these oppositional discourses, in
turn, is also blinded to what is weakest and most vulnerable in it. I
mean, to repeat, the ontological contradiction --- what I have been
calling the specter --- at the enabling center of its \"benign\" global
discourse: the violent genocidal will to power that was the \"end\" of
the (onto)logical economy that justified America\'s intervention in
Vietnam and its indiscriminately murderous conduct of the war. All of
which is to say, finally, that an adversarial discourse that would be
adequate to the task of resisting the New World Order --- that, in Noam
Chomsky\'s aptly ironic phrase, would be capable of \"deterring
democracy\"67 --- would do well not simply to reconstellate and
rethink]{.underline} \"Vietnam\" in the context of the annunciation of
the end of history, but, in doing so, to take its directives precisely
from the spectral contradictions (the radical differences) precipitated
by the \"fulfillment\" of the imperial logic of the American
anthropologos in the Vietnam War. [In other words, the retrieval of the
repressed history of the Vietnam War points to an adversarial strategy
that would refuse to engage its infinitely more formidable antagonist
according to the terms prescribed by the latter\'s imperial problematic,
would not, that is, be answerable to the \"truth\" of its visibly
invisible metanarrative. It calls for the adoption of a strategy that
exploits its adversary\'s essential weakness: the powerful will to
closure that hides behind its tolerance of difference, its alleged
pluralism. It calls, that is, for an adversarial strategy that, like the
strategy of the Vietnamese Other in the face of the utterly predictable
narrativity of the American invaders\' metaphysically structured
discourse and practice, takes the form of an itinerant
spectrality.]{.underline} I mean a nomadic phantasmagoric absence, a
mobile nonpresent presence, a haunting invisibility, that reverses the
panoptic gaze of the dominant culture in transforming itself as seen
into absent see-er. In short, the retrieval of the repressed history of
the Vietnam War calls for a de-structive strategy that, like the
Vietnamese Other vis-a-vis \"America,\" resists identification and thus
frustrates the will to closure of the triumphant culture and in so doing
dis-integrates its discourse of decidability and arrival, which is to
say, disempowers and delegitimizes its imperial power and legitimacy.
Commenting on the representation of the Vietnam War by the American
Mission and the legion of American correspondents based in Saigon who
got their truths from it, Michael Herr writes decisively: \[I\]n back of
every column of print you read about Vietnam there was a dripping,
laughing death-face; it hid there in the newspapers and magazines and
held to your television screen for hours after the set was turned off
for the night, an after-image that simply wanted to tell you at last
what somehow had not been told.68 It is not simply the story --- the
\"secret history\"69 --- that had somehow not been told by the American
media that now, in the post-Cold War occasion, calls for [retrieval.
What the collective will to forget this story demands beyond that
imperative is that we think the laughing deathface--- the polysemous
specter of Vietnam --- that remained to haunt our information-filled
American living room long after we turned our television set off. For in
that haunting apparition there resides a \"reality,\" a \"saying,\"
that, precisely because of its \"unreality\" and its unsayableness, can
have no proper place in the tables of the New World Order. To say that
this \"reality\" ---this \"saying\" ---can have no proper place in the
tables of the New World Order is to say, of course, that \"it\"
constitutes a mortal threat to the \"triumphant\" technological \"age of
the world picture.\"]{.underline}

### AT: Framework 

#### Ontology is a prior question to pragmatic discussions, it's a pre-requisite

[Traditional commentators on Western imperialism, whether imperialist or
anti-imperialist in their sympathies, have invariably situated its
historical origins in modernity, indeed, as concurrent with the
emergence of the Enlightenment.]{.underline} Until recently, these
commentators have also tended to restrict the parameters of the
imperialist project to economics or economics/politics. They have, as in
the cases of Adam Smith, Ricardo, and the other classical capitalist
economists, on the one hand, a[nd Marx and Engels, on the other,
privileged the economic site as a base to essentially epiphenomenal
superstructural sites such as ontology, gender, religion, culture, and
information. T]{.underline}hese commentators always refer to earlier
European empires such as those of Alexander the Great and, above all,
the Romans, but they invariably represent the imperialism of these
empires as that which imperialism proper is not. These commentators
refer to other sites besides the economic or economic/political,
especially the cultural. But these sites are invariably represented as
superstructural and thus, like Alexandrian Greece and imperial Rome,
play no significant role in the elaboration of the genealogy, meaning,
and administrative operations of modern imperialism. More recently, by
way of the implicit interrogation of the base/ superstructure model by
early \"postcolonial\" or \"Third World\" critics such as Frantz Fanon,
C. L. R. James, and Albert Memmi, and of the explicit solicitation of
this Ricardian/Marxist model by theoreticians such as Antonio Gramsci,
Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Raymond Williams, \"postmodern\"
critics of imperialism --- Edward W. Said, V. G. Kiernan, Homi Bhabha,
Gayatri Spivak, Peter Hulme, Benedict Anderson, Mary Louise Pratt, and
others --- [have begun to attend to the ways actual events undermine the
structural relationship between the metropolitan center and the
provincial periphery enabled by teleological interpretations of history.
These thinkers, and the legion of \"cultural critics\" their work has
instigated, have come to see what an earlier generation of commentators
was blinded to by its base/superstructure interpretive model: the
overdetermination of cultural or information production in the
\"postimperial\" or \"postcolonial\" or \"late capitalist\" twentieth
century. And that insight has enabled these critics to focus on the
complicity of cultural production with the imperialist
project.]{.underline} This shift of attention from the economic or
economic/political to the cultural site in the discourse about
imperialism was inaugurated by Said\'s appropriation of Foucault\'s
poststructuralist genealogy of the disciplinary society for his critique
of Western knowledge production about the Orient. [And it has
contributed significantly to the understanding of modern imperialism and
thus to the development of a discourse of resistance that could be
adequate to the conditions of international power relations in late
capitalism, the conditions that, by way of the \"end\" of the Cold War,
have culminated in what I will call in this book the Pax Americana.
Despite original and telling insights, however, contemporary discourses
of resistance have confronted an impasse in the face of the sudden
collapse of actually existing communism and the representation of this
event as the global triumph of liberal capitalist democracy in the late
1980s and 1990s. The very titles of books written from a Left
perspective in the aftermath of the Cold War bear witness to
this:]{.underline} After the Fall; Whither Marxism? What\'s Left?1 If
one does not accede to such representative triumphalist interpretations
of the events of 1989-91 as that proffered by the intellectual deputies
of the dominant cultural order[, then one is compelled to ask what it is
about the contemporary post-Cold War occasion that accounts for the
inability of existing oppositional discourses to mount a convincing and
effective critique of a global imperialism that represents its multiply
situated brutalizing rapacity in the seductive image of an essentially
benign agency of amelioration.]{.underline} This chapter will take a
preliminary cut at this difficult question by undertaking a genealogy of
modern Occidental imperialism --- the Pax Americana. It will retrieve
the ontological origin of this imperialism from the oblivion to which
much postcolonial criticism has relegated it. Ironically, this
[obliteration of the ontological provenance of imperialism takes place
even as the spirit of the latter\'s binary ontological
categories]{.underline} [(Identity and difference, Disciplinarity and
amorphousness, Subject and object, Truth and error) and, above all, of
the binary tropes --- the \"white mythology\" --- that this ontology
enables (the Center and periphery, Light and dark, the Eye and the other
senses, Culture and anarchy, Maturation and underdevelopment, Male and
female, etc.) e]{.underline}verywhere haunts this postcolonial
discourse. Such an undertaking does not presume to provide a completely
adequate answer to the vexing question of imperialism. [Nor, despite my
reservations about their focus, is it intended to proffer an alternative
to existing poststructural or postcolonial or post-Marxist or
postfeminist discourses of resistance. It is, rather, meant to be an
Auseinandersetzung --- an antagonistic dialogue with them,2 one that
would disclose crucial aspects of actually existing imperialism that
these allegedly more historical and more practical critical discourses
are blind to.]{.underline} By retrieving the question of being (die
Seinsfrage), in other words, I am not implying the recuperation of the
Summum Ens (Being) that is endemic to the ontotheological tradition, the
disciplinary category that has contributed fundamentally to the
colonizing operations of its discourses and practices[. My intention is
to bring into focus the indissoluble lateral continuum that includes
being as such, the subject, the ecos, gender, culture, race, economy,
and the national and international socius. I mean, more specifically,
the relay of sites that is always uneven because it always undergoes
asymmetrical transformation in history.3 This is what is
crucial.]{.underline} A particular historical conjuncture will
overdetermine one or more \"domains\" of this relay over the others.
[Given the depth to which the arbitrary compartmentalization of being is
inscribed in the Occidental consciousness --- of even those who would
resist its disciplinary/classificatory imperatives --- the historically
produced imbalance in the relay evokes the disabling illusion that the
overdetermined site (or sites) is separate from and constitutes a
universal and determining base to the other (epiphenomenal)
superstructural sites]{.underline}. [This seductive characteristic of
the historical \"destiny\" of being, for example, explains Marx and
Engels\'s tendency to represent the means of production as a
foundational category in the middle of the nineteenth century, which
bore witness to the rise and overdetermination of capital. It also, in a
far more vulgar and misleading way, explains Fukuyama\'s representation
of the underlying ontological principle of liberal capitalist democracy
as a determining base at the end of the twentieth century. In the years
following the advent of \"theory,\" the prevailing, praxisoriented
oppositional discourses have become indifferent or even hostile to the
question of being.]{.underline} And this indifference or hostility is,
admittedly, understandable, given the political impotence of the
discourses of such \"early\" theorists as Heidegger, Derrida, and
Lyotard, which have privileged ontological questions. Nevertheless, the
abandonment of the question of being by recent oppositional discourses,
I submit, has been disabling for criticism. In thinking the question of
the imperial[, I will therefore overdetermine the site of ontology. But
this is not to imply that I am attributing this site with privileged
ontological status. Rather, I want to compensatorily put back into play
a crucial category of the imperial project. But it should be remembered,
in keeping with what I have called the indissoluble continuum of being,
that the ontological representation of being is polyvalent in
essence.]{.underline} When, that is, I am referring to ontological
categories such as Identity and difference, I am implicitly, however
asymmetrically, referring to all the other sites on this continuous
lateral relay.

#### Ressentiment DA

**Antonio '95** -- ("Nietzsche's Antisociology: Subjectified Culture and
the End of History," American Journal of Sociology, Volume 101, 1995)
//pshah

According to Nietzsche, the "subject" is Socratic culture's most
central, durable foundation. [This prototypic expression of
ressentiment, master reification, and ultimate justification for slave
morality and mass discipline "separates strength from expressions of
strength, as if there were a neutral substratum . . . free to express
strength or not to do so. But there is no such substratum; there is no
'being' behind the doing, effecting, becoming; 'the doer' is merely a
fiction added to the deed"]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1969b, pp. 45-46).
Leveling of Socratic culture's "objective" foundations makes its
"subjective" features all the more important. For example, the subject
is a central focus of the new human sciences, appearing prominently in
its emphases on neutral standpoints, motives as causes, and selves as
entities, objects of inquiry, problems, and targets of care (Nietzsche
1966, pp. 19-21; 1968a, pp. 47-54). [Arguing that subjectified culture
weakens the personality, Nietzsche spoke of a "remarkable antithesis
between an interior which fails to correspond to any exterior and an
exterior which fails to correspond to any interior"]{.underline}
(Nietzsche 1983, pp. 78-79, 83). [The "problem of the
actor," Nietzsche said, "troubled me for the longest time."'12
He considered "roles" as "external," "surface," or
"foreground" phenomena and viewed close personal identification with
them as symptomatic of estrangement]{.underline}. While modern theorists
saw differentiated roles and professions as a matrix of autonomy and
reflexivity, [Nietzsche held that persons (especially male
professionals) in specialized occupations overidentify with their
positions and engage in gross fabrications to obtain advancement. They
look hesitantly to the opinion of others, asking themselves, "How ought
I feel about this?" They are so thoroughly absorbed in
simulating effective role players that they have trouble being anything
but actors-"The role has actually become the character."]{.underline}
This highly subjectified social self or simulator suffers devastating
inauthenticity[. The powerful authority given the social
greatly amplifies Socratic culture's already self-indulgent
"inwardness." Integrity, decisiveness, spontaneity, and pleasure are
undone by paralyzing overconcern about possible causes, meanings,
and consequences of acts andunending internal dialogue about what others
might think, expect, say, or do]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 83-86;
1986, pp. 39-40; 1974, pp. 302-4, 316-17). [Nervous rotation of socially
appropriate "masks" reduces persons to hypostatized "shadows,"
"abstracts," or simulacra. One adopts "many roles," playing them "badly
and superficially" in the fashion of a stiff "puppet play." Nietzsche
asked, "Are you genuine? Or only an actor?  A representative or that
which is represented? . . . \[Or\] no more than an imitation of an
actor?" Simulation is so pervasive that it is hard to tell the copy from
the genuine article; social selves "prefer the copies to the
originals"]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 84-86; 1986, p. 136; 1974,
pp. 232- 33, 259; 1969b, pp. 268, 300, 302; 1968a, pp. 26-27). Their
inwardness and aleatory scripts foreclose genuine attachment to
others. This type of actor cannot plan for the long term or participate
in enduring networks of interdependence; such a person is neither
willing nor able to be a "stone" in the societal "edifice" (Nietzsche

expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and

fawning, cringing, arrogant, all according to circumstances. " Social
selves are fodder for the "great man of the masses." [Nietzsche held
that "the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets

[Such a political program has far reaching consequences, both for

conducted. The living population of the earth has inherited a vision of
[sovereign power,]{.mark} which [has spread cancerously into even the
most]{.mark} seemingly [inaccessible aspects of everyday life.]{.mark}
This vision commands all, claims legitimacy for all, and determines the
conduct of living for all within its domain. [Politics]{.mark} 'as we
know it' [is caught inextricably in the web of sovereign power, in such
a way that]{.mark} it seems that [modern political debate cannot help
but circulate around the same, routine issues: \"What is the appropriate
legislative response?\"; \"Is it within the State's powers to intervene
in this particular conflict?\"]{.mark}]{.underline}; \"How can we ensure
the citizen's rights are maintained in the face of the state?\". [[To
challenge]{.mark} such [an encompassing and peremptory]{.mark} political
[discourse]{.mark} --- [where every question implies the sovereign
absolutely, and every decision made refers to life itself]{.mark} ---
[would require]{.mark} the most intensive [rethinking]{.mark} of the way
in which territory, governance and economy are imagined.]{.underline} In
this sense, whilst Agamben's analysis of bare life, and Foucault's
theory of bio-power, provide a means by which to assess the condition of
non-human life with respect to sovereign power, [[the political
project]{.mark} must reach beyond these terms, and embrace an
intertwining of the human and the non-human: an
intersection]{.underline} which may be found in the animal life [shared

[Further, it has not been adequately remarked by his commentators that
Heidegger, in the process of disclosing the genealogy of humanist
modernity (what he identified as the \"age of the world picture\"),
called this tradition \"onto-theo-logical\" to differentiate between
three epochal historical phases of the history of Western
philosophy.]{.underline} These are the inaugural onto-logical era
(Greco-Roman, in which the *logos* as e-mergent *physis* becomes
*ratio,* simultaneously imminent in and external to nature); the
theo-logical (the medieval/Protestant, in which the *logos* as *ratio
becomes the visible and transcendental Logos or Word of God);* and the
anthropo-logical (the Enlightenment, in which the visible Word of God
becomes the invisible *Logos* of Man). [These epochal revolutions in the
history of philosophy were epistemic in scope and depth. But the
revolutionary character of these transformations should not obscure the
recuperative representational impulse informing each phase of
representation --- not least the anthropological, the phase that is
alleged by Foucauldians, and all-too-casually assumed by many cultural
and postcolonial critics, to have constituted an epistemic break in the
thought of the Occident.]{.underline} I mean the mimetological impulse
that kept the *idea* of Europe intact even as it underwent massively
historically specific transformations. What all three epochs have
fundamentally in common, what \"Europe\" did not allow to pass away into
historical oblivion, what it, in a virtually unthought way, carried over
from the disintegration of the *episteme* of each phase, was the
*logos.* Let me retrieve an inaugural postmodern theoretical insight
into this stable differential/identical --- logocentric --- history that
has by now become ineffectually sedimented in the posttheory occasion:
[\[O\]n the basis of what we call the center (and which, because it can
be either inside or outside, can also indifferently be called the origin
or end, *arche* or *telos*), repetitions, substitutions,
transformations, and permutations are always taken from a history of
meaning *\[sens\]*---that is, in a word, a history --- whose origin may
always be reawakened or whose end may always be anticipated in the form
of presence\.... If this is so, the entire history of the concept of
structure, before the rupture of which we are speaking, must be thought
of as a series of substitutions of center for center, as a linked chain
of determinations of the center. Successively, and in a regulated
fashion, the center receives different forms or names.]{.underline} The
history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of
these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix\... is the determination of
Being as presence in all senses of this word.5

By the late 1980s, the rise Of Strategic Studies had resulted in the
establishment Of what Bradley Klein ( 1988a) has termed a [[hegemonic \'
\'strategic culture\"]{.mark} in government circles in
Washington]{.underline} (for an excellent overview Of Strategic Studies
in the US, see Klein 1994). For Klein, \"[strategic culture\" [refers to
the way a modern hegemonic state looks to the use of force to secure its
geopolitical objectives]{.mark}]{.underline} (Klein 1988a, 1988b, 1989,
1994). In outlining the import Of Washington\'s \"strategic culture\"
during the latter stages Of the Cold War, Klein has illuminated the dual
\"declaratory\" and \"operational\" strategies Of deterrence that were
successfully mobilized to both legitimize and suppress dissent for an
overtly aggressive US foreign policy (Klein 1989). For Klein,
[[Strategic Studies \"assigns to violence a regulative function in the
international system\",]{.mark} which also has a \"generative nature\"
--- \"generative of states, of state systems, of world orders, and to
some extent, Of modern identity as well]{.underline}\" (1994:5). As he
argues, [[the \"ability Of strategic violence to reconcile itself with
liberal discourse and modern civil society is possible only because that
violence draws upon]{.mark} a variety Of [discursive resources that
are]{.mark} themselves widely [construed as rational, plausible and
acceptable\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (1994:5). Such discursive resources
include a well-established imperial register Of [essentialist cultural
binaries [whose rhetorical powers depend on simplified imaginative
geographies: us/them]{.mark}]{.underline}, good/evil,
[[civilized/barbarous, order/anarchy]{.mark},]{.underline}
inside/outside and so on. As Klein so usefully has shown, what Strategic
Studies does in effect is \"provide a map for the
[negotiating]{.underline} Of [these dichotomies in such a way that
Western society always winds up on the \"good\" side Of the
equation]{.underline}\" (1994:5). And of course the corollary is then
clear: Our putative enemy, whatever [the form assumed by its postulated
Otherness]{.underline} variously the Soviet Union, or Communism,
[guerrilla insurgents, terrorism]{.underline}, Orientals, Fidel Castro,
Nicaragua, Qaddafi, Noriega or Saddam Hussein simultaneously is endowed
with all of these dialectically opposed qualities. [Strategic violence
is then called in to mediate the relationship, patrol the border,
surveil the opponent and punish its aggression]{.underline} (Klein
1994:5-6). Through the 1990s and 2000s, Washington\'s hawkish and
[hegemonic \"strategic culture\" continued to produce a vast array Of
uncritical, conservative and essentialist Strategic Studies
publications]{.underline} (see, for example: Daalder and Lindsay 2003;
Hooker 2005; Knights 2006; Krepinevich and work 2007; O\'Hanlon 2008;
Ullman et al 1996; Wilson 1999). Aside from the inherent Orientalism, a
key feature Of much Of this work is the [[linking]{.mark} Of US \'
[\'military securitization]{.mark}\" Of the Middle East [to]{.mark} a
broader and long- term [neoliberal \"economic securitization\"]{.mark}
project.]{.underline} Outside Of Washington, Other prominent DOD
institutes also augmented [this military-geoeconomic grand strategy and
further [cemented]{.mark} the relationship between [the scripting Of
strategic knowledge and production Of actionable military
intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include: the Strategic Studies
Institute at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania; 7 the
Center for Naval Warfare Studies at the US Naval War College in Newport,
Rhode Island;s the School Of Advanced Military Studies in Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas; 9 and the Center for Terrorism and Irregular
Warfare at the US Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California (see
Blank 1995; Bradford 2001; Hajjar 2002; Jager 2007; Simmons and Manuel
2003).11 For the broader technical and academic defense community, [RAND
Corporation \"strategy papers\" and the leading military and security
journals, such as Joint Force Quarterly, I were also important forums in
the discursive production Of US military strategy in the Middle
East]{.underline} (Byman and Wise 2002; Freeman 1995; Lechowich 2000;
Lesser 1991; Marr 1995; Sokolsky, Johnson and Larrabee 2001). In the
opening issue Of Joint Force Quarterly in 1993, the then Chairman Of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, presented it as \"the most recent
addition\" to what [the US military calls \"jointness]{.underline}\":
that \"all men and women in uniform, each service, and every one Of our
great civilian employees understand that we must fight as a team\"
(1993:5). At this juncture, [the military-strategic studies complex was
very much part Of that team, and the establishment of official
\"Strategic Studies\" centers, affiliated and sponsored by the DOD, was
the natural progression for [the ever-growing defense think- tank
culture Of Washington and the Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}. The George
C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies was set up in Sheridan
Barracks, Garmisch Partenkirchen, southwest Of Munich, in 1993. It
[[plays an active role in supporting]{.mark} US European Command
([EUCOM]{.mark}) security objectives and those Of US Central Command
([CENTCOM]{.mark}]{.underline}) [respecting the six Central Asian states
Of Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. [The Asia-Pacific Center for Security
Studies was established at Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1995, and closely
supports the national security objectives Of US Pacific Command]{.mark}
([PACOM]{.mark}). 14 [The Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies was
founded at the National Defense University in Washington in 1997, and
works with US Southern Command]{.mark} ([SOUTHCOM]{.mark}) [and the
recently established US Northern Command]{.mark}
([NORTHCOM]{.mark}).]{.underline} 15 [T[he Africa Center for Strategic
Studies was instituted at the National Defense University in 1999; it
now co- ordinates with the newly-created US Africa
Command]{.underline}]{.mark} [([AFRICOM]{.mark}]{.underline}). 16 And in
2000, the DOD created the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic
Studies (NESA) at the National Defense University. This was the last Of
five DOD regional centers for Strategic Studies set up under the Clinton
administration (see figure l). It regularly hosts security specialists
and military personnel from a range Of countries on training and study
programs, and coordinates closely with CENTCOM in effecting national
security objectives in the Persian Gulf region. The DOD\'s five regional
centers for Strategic Studies are Of critical importance to the US
military apparatus, and are a direct intellectual and strategic advisory
support to the now six regional unified commands (figure 2). They
regularly produce a wide range Of reports and strategy recommendations.
18 NESA staff members, for example, have published a prolific array Of
materials since the founding Of the institute in 2000 (Lawrence 2008).19
Their academic productions reflect an evidently broad strategy in
targeting different audiences, ranging from monographs, book chapters
and conference papers, to security journal articles, military briefing
papers, and mainstream op-eds and commentaries. [This is hardly
surprising Of course; the DOD, after all, has been fully versed in the
power and import Of discourse for some time]{.underline}.
