The world has its eye on the trade war between the US and China, but a
more dangerous confrontation between the two nations is playing out in
the background: the worsening disagreement over the \"One China\"
policy. Last week, Reuters reported **[that]{.underline}** **[Washington
was on its way to approving \$2 billion worth of arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. The move **[indicates]{.underline}** the Trump
administration isn\'t trying to create an atmosphere conducive to trade
negotiations and suggests **[that disputes between the US and China are
more likely headed toward escalation than resolution]{.underline}**.
**[\"Taiwan is the thing the Chinese care most about hands
down,\"]{.underline}** said Susan Thornton, a former assistant US
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \"**[Anything
where the US is interfering with Taiwan hits a national third rail.\"
The One China policy]{.underline}** --- under which **[the US
acknowledges China\'s claim that Taiwan is not an independent nation but
rather a part of China]{.underline}**, without taking a side --- was
developed during the Nixon administration to improve US-China relations.
The idea is central to China\'s identity as a modern world power, and
since President Donald Trump took office the US has challenged that
notion repeatedly. Despite protests from Beijing, Trump signed the
Taiwan Travel Act, legislation permitting high-level talks between US
and Taiwanese officials, last year. In May, the US national security
adviser, John Bolton, met with David Lee, one of Taiwan\'s top security
officials. This meeting came just after Taiwan renamed its unofficial
embassy in Washington the Taiwan Council for US Affairs. The old name,
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, neglected to
mention Taiwan or the US. The Trump administration has also sold arms to
Taiwan before, as have previous administrations, **[but this \$2 billion
arms sale digs at a delicate wound during a delicate
time.]{.underline}** It\'s a big sale, even in a world where weapons are
becoming more and more expensive. And though it does not include the
US\'s top fighter jets, **[it is sure to antagonize
Beijing]{.underline}** before the G20 meeting at the end of the month in
Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese heads of state are expected to meet.
On Thursday, **[a Chinese Foreign Ministry representative, Geng Shuang,
responded to the news of the arms sale with a warning,]{.underline}**
according to the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. **\"[We urge the US
side to stop arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} and sever their military
ties,** prudently and **[properly handle Taiwan-related issues, to avoid
serious damage to China-US relations as well as to the peace and
stability of the Taiwan Strait,\"]{.underline}** Geng said. It\'s just
imagination In January 2017, China --- most likely aware that the
incoming US president was unfamiliar with the complexities of US-China
relations --- clarified its position on Taiwan in a rare US media
interview by the Chinese Foreign Ministry official Lu Kang. \"**[Because
this issue touches upon China\'s core interest, by no means is this
something that could be negotiated or used as a bargaining
chip,]{.underline}**\" he told NBC. \" One China policy, 100%.\" The
fight over Taiwan\'s status started in 1949 after the Nationalist leader
Chiang Kai-shek left the mainland for the island when he was defeated by
Mao Zedong\'s Communist forces. To the Chinese, the island\'s
independence is both a product and a reminder of China\'s century of
humiliation, when China was carved up by foreign powers and then thrown
into decades of chaos and civil war after the end of the Qing dynasty.
\"It\'s the mythology they\'ve told themselves for years,\" Thornton
said. In that way **[the One China policy and China\'s economic
nationalism are tied together in the Chinese political]{.underline}**
**[imagination]{.underline}**. That may seem foreign to the US, where
one set of technocrats handles economics and another handles national
security, but the merging of the two interests are a response to the
China\'s lost century. **[And]{.underline}** both **[are being tested by
the Trump administration]{.underline}**. xi trump Chinese President Xi
Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing in November 2017. Damir Sagolj/Reuters **[While the US-China
trade war producing a \" tech Cold War\" has grabbed headlines, less
attention has been paid to escalation in hostilities surrounding the One
China policy.]{.underline}** This despite the fact that the conflict has
all the trappings of the Cold War era. **[China sees US interference in
Taiwan as an encroachment on its sphere of influence]{.underline}**. And
the US sees Chinese involvement in the Caribbean similarly. Back in
February 2018 after a speech in Texas, then-Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson warned Latin American nations of China\'s \"imperial\"
ambitions, invoking the Monroe Doctrine. \"Latin America does not need
new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people,\" he
said. \"China\'s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the
past. It doesn\'t have to be this hemisphere\'s future.\" **[All of this
matters for Taiwan because the more involved a country is with China,
the more pressure China puts on it to wipe Taiwan off the
map.]{.underline}** Earlier this year the Dominican Republic dropped its
recognition of Taiwan at China\'s behest. El Salvador did it in 2018,
and Panama in 2017. **[There may be a Cold War-reminiscent motivation
behind this arms sale as well.]{.underline}** Taiwan\'s anti-China
president, **[Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen, **[faces an uphill battle for
reelection next year. In Washington the sale may be seen as a way to
bolster her chances of winning. \"One thing US administrations tend to
think, which may or may not be true]{.underline}**,\" Thornton said,
\"**[is that selling weapons to Taiwan helps political candidates show
that they have US support and can stand up to China.\" We --- the US and
China --- may be slipping into a world where that theory has to be
tested.]{.underline}**

#### This emboldens the hardliners of the DPP who use arms sales as the pretext for independence-inviting Chinese backlash and pushing the Straits to the brink and war

perilous Taiwan policy,\" Strategist,
https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/chinas-perilous-taiwan-policy/

**[The unfolding geopolitical contest between China and the United
States has been described by many as a new cold war. If it ever becomes
a hot one, the flashpoint could be Taiwan,]{.underline}** owing in large
part to Chinese policy towards the island. **[China's government
suspended diplomatic contact with Taiwan in June 2016 because the
pro-independence]{.underline}** Democratic Progressive Party
(**[DPP]{.underline}**), which **[had just returned to power, refused to
recognise the]{.underline}** so-called 1992 Consensus, **[the political
basis for the One China principle]{.underline}**. **[Since the 2016
victory, however, Taiwanese President Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen **[has
pursued a moderate policy, disappointing hardline DPP
supporters.]{.underline}** That is not good enough for China, which has
continued to tighten the screws on Taiwan. For example, it persuaded
five other countries to follow it in severing diplomatic ties, reducing
the number of countries that maintain formal relations with the island
to just 17. China has also taken steps to stifle tourism from the
mainland: whereas nearly 4.2 million mainland-Chinese tourists visited
Taiwan in 2015, when the pro-Beijing Kuomintang government was in power,
the total fell to just 2.73 million in 2017. **[Taiwan's government has
not blinked.]{.underline}** But, last November, the DPP did suffer
devastating losses in local elections, largely because of anaemic
economic growth---an outcome that drove the politically weakened Tsai to
resign as party leader. For China, this seemed like the ideal moment to
turn up the heat. So, on 2 January, Chinese **[President
Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[delivered a]{.underline}** major **[speech
on Taiwan, in which he made it clear that China remains determined to
seek reunification.]{.underline}** Xi dismissed the argument that
China's autocratic political system is fundamentally incompatible with
Taiwan's boisterous democracy, insisting that the **['one country, two
systems']{.underline}** formula, first applied to Hong Kong when it
reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, would be sufficient to
protect Taiwan's interests and autonomy. The formula is, however, now
unravelling in Hong Kong, where freedoms have been eroding during Xi's
tenure. **[Nor did Xi indicate that he would offer concessions to entice
Taiwan back to the negotiating table]{.underline}**. On the contrary,
despite declaring that 'Chinese will not fight Chinese', **[he refused
to renounce the use of force to prevent Taiwan from seeking formal
independence.]{.underline}** China must, in his words, 'reserve the
option to take any necessary measure', though he claims that the threat
is aimed at 'external forces and at an extremely small number of "Taiwan
independence" separatists'. Again, Taiwan's government was unfazed.
**[Tsai responded with a defiant speech of her own, in which she flatly
rejected both the One China principle and the 'one country, two systems'
formula,]{.underline}** and called for the international community to
support Taiwan's de facto independence. Although Xi's tough stance
towards Taiwan may end up reinvigorating flagging support for Tsai and
the DPP, there is no reason to think that he will abandon it anytime
soon. But nor is there reason to think that China's policy will stop
backfiring. While inflicting economic pain and diplomatic humiliation on
Taiwan may produce some short-term psychological satisfaction for China,
the island will adjust over time and Chinese actions will yield
decreasing returns. For example, after China cut the number of mainland
visitors, Taiwan turned its attention to attracting tourists from other
countries. Despite the decline in visitors from the mainland, 11 million
tourists---a new record---visited the island in 2018. To reduce its
economic dependence on the mainland, Taiwan has also been aggressively
diversifying its overseas markets. And **[although China's economy is
far larger, Taiwan has some important sources of
leverage.]{.underline}** For example, restricting **[its electronics
industry]{.underline}**---which forms a vital link between China and
global information-technology supply chains---from doing business with
the mainland would significantly accelerate the exodus of
export-oriented manufacturers from China spurred by rising US import
tariffs. **[Perhaps the most dangerous consequence of China's Taiwan
policy is that it raises further tensions with the United States. As the
ultimate protector of Taiwan's de facto independence, the US has already
taken steps to convey]{.underline}** the message that **[it will not
just sit by and watch China bully the island]{.underline}** into
submission. Last February, **[the US Congress unanimously passed the
Taiwan Travel Act]{.underline}**, which will allow senior American
officials to visit Taiwan and vice versa. **[Though the measure is
largely symbolic, it has infuriated China,]{.underline}** because it
amounts to official recognition of the Taiwan government. Furthermore,
in September, the US recalled its ambassadors to the Dominican Republic,
El Salvador and Panama in protest over these countries' decisions to
sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. **[And proposals to strengthen
US--Taiwan defence cooperation, including through the sale of more
advanced weapons, are under discussion.]{.underline}** **[So far, China
has responded to such challenges to its One China policy by ratcheting
up the pressure on Taiwan---sustaining a highly dangerous dynamic at a
time when US--China relations are already fraught. Unless China's
leaders break the cycle, an escalating battle of wills with the US could
erupt into direct conflict.]{.underline}**

#### Independently, It's the Chinese Nationalism! 

**Edney 15** (Kignsley Edney- University of Leeds, "Building National
Cohesion and Domestic Legitimacy: A Regime Security Approach to Soft
Power in China," Political Studies association: 2015 VOL 35(3-4),
259--272) RK

[Soft power is primarily relevant to the enhancement of regime
legitimacy where a significant component of the moral justification for
maintaining the current system is based on the regime's ability to
improve the international status of the national unit]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} international **[increase in positive attraction that
is associated with a rise in soft power makes it easier for the regime
to convince its citizens of the truth of its claim that the country's
international status is improving under its leadership]{.underline}**,
where '[status' is defined not only in terms of material
capabilities]{.underline}, but also in terms of social recognition. For
the most part, [evidence of an increase in international recognition and
attraction could be used to bolster claims that the regime has
successfully improved the country's international status]{.underline},
[regardless of whether soft power is a result of attraction to political
values, culture or foreign policies, or whether it is generated by the
policies of the regime or sources within broader society]{.underline}.
Some internationally attractive cultural products can also be the work
of dissidents or relate to aspects of culture or values that the regime
would rather suppress, however, and these sources of attraction are
difficult for the authorities to exploit. Chinese political elites feel
a keen sense of obligation to restore the country's past great power
status (Deng, 2008, pp. 8--9) and show its people that China is globally
respected and admired (Zhang, 2012, p. 620). [The leadership attempts to
appease domestic nationalist audiences by gaining 'face' for China
abroad]{.underline} (Gries, 2004, pp. 120--121) **[and the party-state
has often publicized statements of support or admiration from foreign
allies to demonstrate China's international status and thereby bolster
its moral claim to rule]{.underline}** (e.g. Brady, 2003, p. 228). If
there is a broad-based growth in Chinese soft power, these [statements
are likely to become more common and more credible as the number and
variety of foreign actors who are attracted to China
increases]{.underline}. Moreover, [international attraction to China's
success]{.underline} in areas such as economic development [expands the
number of 'nodes' in networks of 'legitimacy belief']{.underline},
thereby reducing the marginal cost of persuasion and squeezing out
alternative discourses that might challenge regime legitimacy
(Gerschewski, 2013, pp. 26--27). [This makes it easier for the CCP to
claim legitimacy based on its success in moving China toward the shared
goal of national 'rejuvenation']{.underline}. **[Although 'national
cohesion' is a concept that is rather nebulous and difficult to assess,
the regular references to 'cohesion' in official CCP statements indicate
that Chinese leaders are worried about it and seek to improve
it]{.underline}** (e.g. CCP Central Committee, 2011; 2013). As China has
become a more plural society, [generating social consensus]{.underline}
(ningju gongshi) [and unifying the people]{.underline} (ningju renxin)
[have become serious concerns for the propaganda
authorities]{.underline} (Edney, 2014). According to propaganda chief
Liu Yunshan, achieving the 'China dream' of the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation requires cultural cohesion (Xinhua, 2013), while an
early article on national cultural security published on a CCP website
argues that if a country lacks cohesion -- even if it is strong in terms
of other forms of power -- when it faces challenges such as a natural
disaster or foreign invasion it will 'collapse at the first blow' (bu
kan yi ji) (Yang, 2006). A lack of national cohesion can be a persistent
problem for weak states that are unable to generate 'a domestic
political and social consensus of sufficient strength to eliminate the
large-scale use of force as a major and continuing element in the
domestic political life of the nation' (Buzan, 1983, p. 67).[Normally
soft power refers to a country's attractiveness to foreign
constituencies]{.underline}. [To consider the possibility that it could
enhance national cohesion]{.underline}, however**[, it is necessary to
apply the concept to the relationship between domestic
constituencies]{.underline}**. In this sense, the soft power of the
political, social and cultural core of the polity encourages domestic
interest groups and individuals on the margins to want the same
outcomes, such as stability and national cohesion, as the authorities at
the center. Although this might seem to be a major step away from the
traditional interpretation of soft power, Nye's (2011, pp. 19--20)
argument that [soft power is a key requirement of an effective
counter-insurgency strategy and that dealing with the threat of
terrorism requires the soft power of an appealing narrative that can win
over mainstream society and prevent terrorists recruiting new members to
their groups,]{.underline} highlights the concept's potential
significance for state efforts to respond to domestic sources of
instability. In this case, **[soft power involves enhancing regime
security by making it less likely that domestic adversaries who pose a
threat to national cohesion will be able to obtain material support from
the local population, which then makes it easier for the state to deal
with the security threat they pose]{.underline}**. The [authorities in
Beijing]{.underline} [face a range of threats to national cohesion from
peripheral regions]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the ongoing
problem of terrorism and insurgent attacks in Xinjiang, protests and
discontent in Tibet, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and **[de facto
independence in Taiwan]{.underline}**. In light of these challenges [it
would not be unreasonable]{.underline} for scholars, or even the
authorities, **[to interpret 'soft power' as something that could also
be applied to improve regime security by enhancing the cohesion between
the political, social and cultural core of the Chinese polity and those
on the margins.]{.underline}** Indeed, in more general terms, Wang and
Lu (2008, p. 427) have pointed out that Chinese interpretations of soft
power include 'the ability to generate compliance in a society by moral
example and persuasion'. **[The concept is also relevant to China's
regime security because the soft power of other actors can constitute a
threat to cohesion or CCP legitimacy]{.underline}**. [Taiwan's soft
power]{.underline}, according to most Taiwanese, [stems primarily from
its democratic system and values]{.underline} (Wang and Lu, 2008, p.
432). [The appeal of Taiwan's democracy has increased international
support for the Taiwanese authorities]{.underline} (Hughes, 1999, pp.
134--136), [particularly in the US, and thus undermines party-state
efforts to push for reunification]{.underline}. The liberal democratic
values that are a key feature of American soft power are also a source
of regime insecurity in China and will be discussed further in the
section on soft power and cultural security below. Non-state actors can
also possess soft power (Nye, 2004, pp. 90--97) and in China's case the
soft power of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan exile community can have a
negative effect on party-state efforts to generate national cohesion.
[Dealing with these challenges is not as simple as improving Chinese
soft power,]{.underline} since an increase in the attractiveness of one
actor does not necessarily result in another becoming less attractive.
**[When the values the CCP appeals to in order to justify its rule are
incompatible with the values associated with the soft power of other
actors, however, Chinese attempts to build soft power become more
competitive and defensive]{.underline}**. Li (2009, p. 33) points out
that many Chinese analysts and other elites believe that [policies to
increase China's cultural competitiveness can reduce the influence of
Western culture and defend against the infiltration of liberal political
ideas, especially among China's youth.]{.underline}

the Taiwan Travel Act, with a [potential
review](https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-bolton-likely-tackle-one-china-mantra/4313138.html)
of its "One China Policy" in the future, Taiwan's significance to
Beijing appears unwavering. [As a starting point to improving the
Sino-American relationship over the Taiwan question, perhaps it is time
for the United States to reexamine what Taiwan really means to
China.]{.underline} First and foremost, the resolution of **[Taiwan's
status has major implications for the Communist Party of China's (CCP)
legitimacy as the ruling party of China]{.underline}**. [This legitimacy
can be broken down into three parts: legitimacy from the Chinese Civil
War, CCP statements and policies, and history. For the CCP, Taiwan
represents the final obstacle to truly concluding the Chinese Civil
War]{.underline}. [The island is not just a haven]{.underline} for the
Kuomintang who lost the civil war on the Mainland, [**but also
represents a threat to Beijing's system of governance as an alternative
model for the Chinese people**. To maintain its grip on the Chinese
state, the CCP believes it must finish what Mao could not]{.underline}
and defeat the "followers" of Chiang Kai-shek---thereby [eliminating a
threat to China's internal stability. It also does not help that the CCP
have also backed themselves into this corner]{.underline}. Since the
16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2002, [the CCP
has beenconsistent in its policy toward Taiwan,]{.underline} with
elements of the policy going back to 1995. It is very difficult to back
down from a policy that has been espoused for over twenty years, not to
mention China's [Patriotic Education
Campaign](https://www.economist.com/news/china/21711497-chinas-leadership-playing-it-cool-now-mr-trumps-backing-admirable-neglected)
has solidified Taiwan's status as part of China in the minds of the
Chinese people. Moreover, a key policy heavily promoted by Chinese
President Xi Jinping is the "China Dream" of the "great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation." This most likely includes Chinese reunification
with Taiwan. [From a historical perspective, which ties into the China
Dream]{.underline}, [unification of the country is typically required
for lasting legitimacy]{.underline}. The Chinese dynasties one usually
hears about are the Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming
and Qing. [Very few realize that China has undergone numerous states of
disunity, some periods lasting over one hundred years, with competition
amongst various dynasties and political entities for total control of
China]{.underline}. [**Reabsorbing Taiwan would help cement the People's
Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of all of China and
unquestionably be considered a successor to the legitimate dynasties of
the past.** Beyond legitimacy, the People's Republic has a security
interest in reunification with Taiwan. The island has been called
an]{.underline} [[unsinkable aircraft
carrier]{.underline}](http://www.aei.org/publication/why-taiwan-matters/).
[No doubt Beijing thinks that the United States, or even Taiwan's former
colonial master Japan]{.underline}, [could use the island for military
means to threaten and contain China like they did in the
past]{.underline}. However, the CCP could also use Taiwan
post-reunification to more easily secure its claimed territory in both
the East and South China Seas, as well as interdict Japan's energy
supplies and trade should it ever pose a threat. In addition to serving
as a potential check against the United States and Japan, [Taiwan can be
seen in China's eyes as the first wall in the Mainland's
defenses]{.underline}. During the [Century of
Humiliation](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/3.10.11Kaufman.pdf)
when the Great Powers carved out spheres of influences and imposed
restrictive treaties on China, the Middle Kingdom's naval defenses,
which included Taiwan, were
[insufficient](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1145625/qing-dynasty-naval-defeat-warning-pla)
to prevent it from being manipulated by foreign countries. The CCP,
acutely aware of its nation's history, likely views Taiwan as a key to
deter a future situation in which foreign powers would play a "Great
Game" on the Mainland through the enhanced naval defense capability the
island could provide. [Taiwan's other security pillar is in the realm of
economic security. For China, Taiwan]{.underline} [[sits
between](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/25/11503152/shipping-routes-map) its
major ports]{.underline}---meaning that Taiwan, or whoever could
influence it, could cut off trade to and from the Mainland. Furthermore,
[the island is in a prime position to either secure or threaten
China's[maritime energy
imports](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/20573/energy-demands-increasingly-shape-china-s-behavior-in-the-south-china-sea),
which include around 86 percent of China's oil and over fifty percent of
its natural gas]{.underline}. [Taiwan's potential to endanger Chinese
trade and energy imports, thus the ability for the CCP to maintain
economic growth and control of the country, are major security concerns
Beijing.]{.underline} Finally, **[Taiwan and its reunification with the
Mainland are points of pride and power for China and the
CCP]{.underline}**. [Reunification]{.underline}, or at least preventing
Taiwan's independence, [would show other separatists]{.underline}, such
as those in Xinjiang and Tibet, [that attempts to break away would be
futile.]{.underline} [This would be especially significant due to the
competing identities stemming from both Japanese colonial
rule]{.underline} of the island between 1895 and 1945 and the February
28, 1947 Uprising from where the modern Taiwan independence movement
originates. Reunification would also show the triumph of the CCP over
its political opponents. **[Not to mention, retaking Taiwan on Beijing's
terms would likely lead to the consolidation of its supporters as the
Party will have shown that it and no other political party could
"rejuvenate the Chinese nation."]{.underline}** [Most importantly,
Taiwan represents the largest obstacle to truly ending the Century of
Humiliation. The CCP, and many Chinese, will not allow their pride to be
damaged by Taiwanese independence or a marked change in the island's
status quo.]{.underline} Clearly, [Taiwan means a great deal to Beijing.
Resolving the Taiwan question has legitimacy implications for the CCP,
factors into China's security calculus and is an issue of
patriotism.]{.underline} While the United States has and should maintain
its One China Policy, **[Washington should understand that tampering too
much with relations with Taipei will have consequences. If push comes to
shove over Taiwan, China may not blink.]{.underline}**

#### CCP instability leads to nuclear war. 

**Rexing, 5** (San, Staff -- Epoch Times, The CCP's Last Ditch Gamble:
Biological and Nuclear War, 8-5, http://english.epochtimes.com/
news/5-8-5/30975.html)

What, then, is the gist of this wild, last-ditch gamble? To put it in a
few words: **[A cornered beast is fighting desperately to survive in a
battle with humanity. If you don't believe me, read some passages
directly from the speeches.]{.underline}** 1) "**[We must prepare
ourselves for two scenarios. If our biological weapons succeed in the
surprise attack \[on the US\], the Chinese people will be able to keep
their losses at a minimum in the fight against the U.S.]{.underline}**
If, however, the attack fails and triggers a nuclear retaliation from
the U.S., China would perhaps suffer a catastrophe in which more than
half of its population would perish. That is why we need to be ready
with air defense systems for our big and medium-sized cities.
[**Whatever the case may be, we can only move forward fearlessly for the
sake of our Party and state and our nation's future, regardless of the
hardships we have to face and the sacrifices we have to make. The
population, even if more than half dies, can be reproduced. But if the
Party falls, everything is gone, and forever gone!"**]{.underline} 2)
"**[In any event, we, the CCP, will never step down from the stage of
history! We'd rather have the whole world, or even the entire globe,
share life and death with us than step down from the stage of history!!!
Isn't there a 'nuclear bondage' theory? It means that since the nuclear
weapons have bound the security of the entire world, all will die
together if death is inevitable]{.underline}**. In my view, there is
another kind of bondage, and that is, the fate our Party is tied up with
that of the whole world. If we, the CCP, are finished, China will be
finished, and the world will be finished." 3) "It is indeed brutal to
kill one or two hundred million Americans. But that is the only path
that will secure a Chinese century, a century in which the CCP leads the
world. We, as revolutionary humanitarians, do not want deaths. But if
history confronts us with a choice between deaths of Chinese and those
of Americans, we'd have to pick the latter, as, for us, it is more
important to safeguard the lives of the Chinese people and the life of
our Party. That is because, after all, we are Chinese and members of the
CCP. Since the day we joined the CCP, the Party's life has always been
above all else!" **[Since the Party's life is "above all else," it would
not be surprising if the CCP resorts to the use of biological, chemical,
and nuclear weapons in its attempt to extend its life. The CCP, which
disregards human life, would not hesitate to kill two hundred million
Americans, along with seven or eight hundred million Chinese, to achieve
its ends. These speeches let the public see the CCP for what it really
is. With evil filling its every cell the CCP intends to wage a war
against humankind in its desperate attempt to cling to life. That is the
main theme of the speeches.]{.underline}** This theme is murderous and
utterly evil. In China we have seen beggars who coerced people to give
them money by threatening to stab themselves with knives or pierce their
throats with long nails. But we have never, until now, seen such a
gangster who would use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons to
threaten the world, that all will die together with him. This bloody
confession has confirmed the CCP's nature: that of a monstrous murderer
who has killed 80 million Chinese people and who now plans to hold one
billion people hostage and gamble with their lives.

In the lead-up to the 1996 Taiwanese presidential elections, mainland
China conducted a series of missile tests to express its displeasure
against the pro-independence leanings of then-leader Lee Teng-hui and
impress on the Taiwanese electorate that returning Lee to office might
lead to war. The United States' response to the so-called Third Taiwan
Strait Crisis, which was to order two aircraft carrier groups to the
area, did the trick. The largest display of American military might
since the Vietnam War forced a humiliating Chinese backdown and
persuaded Beijing it needed to modernize its military to counter the
U.S. Navy. The Chinese move also backfired as Lee's popularity in Taiwan
gained a shot in the arm for standing up to the mainland. Back in 1996,
**[China's military budget was only about twice that of Taiwan's and
approximately 16 times smaller than that of the United
States]{.underline}**. Today, **[the People's Liberation Army's (PLA)
budget is almost 22 times larger than Taiwan's and over one-third that
of the United States]{.underline}**. China's advanced short-range
ballistic missile could destroy every runway attached to Taiwan's six
air force bases and destroy almost all Taiwanese fighter planes in the
early moments of a war. The PLA has established superiority over Taiwan
in the air, and on and under the water. The only thing the PLA cannot
achieve is landing troops on Taiwan without suffering unacceptable
losses. In late March, Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald
Trump's advisers had encouraged Taiwan to submit a formal request to buy
up to 60 advanced F-16V fighter planes. Any sale must still be approved
by Congress and would be the first major aircraft purchase from the
United States by Taiwan since 1992. During her visit to Hawaii last
week, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that Taiwan had
requested a purchase of new fighter jets from the United States. Days
later, two Chinese fighter planes crossed the median line in the Taiwan
Strait that divides China and Taiwan -- the first time this has occurred
for 20 years. **[Even if the F-16V sale goes ahead, Taiwan's new planes
will not alter the military balance between China and Taiwan, nor
dissuade the mainland from further provocations such as the median line
flyover.]{.underline}** That is not Beijing's primary concern, however.
The most important calculation China must make is not the relative
capabilities of the Taiwanese armed forces but how the United States
will respond in the event of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
Every clue with respect to uncovering **[U.S. intention is vital because
U.S. intervention could tip the military balance against China in any
such conflict]{.underline}**. In any event, it guarantees the end of any
"acceptable cost" outcome in the event of conflict for China. Under the
United States' 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, any attempt to forcibly
determine Taiwan's future is considered "a threat to peace and security
of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States." **[To
prevent that, Washington is obligated to sell "arms of a defensive
character" to Taipei to allow the latter to defend itself and dissuade
China from launching any military action]{.underline}**. Since the Bill
Clinton era, **[administrations have denied Taiwan's request to purchase
new fighter planes on the basis that the grey line from "defense" to
"offense" might be crossed]{.underline}**. Speaking from Hawaii, **[Tsai
let the cat out of the bag when she said the purchase of advanced fourth
generation fighters would "greatly enhance our land and air
capabilities, strengthen military moral and show to the world the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan's defense."]{.underline}** It is the last line
which sends shivers down the spine of mainland leaders**[. Since the
T]{.underline}**aiwan **[R]{.underline}**elations **[A]{.underline}**ct
came into force, **[the United States has deliberately embarked on a
policy of "strategic ambiguity"]{.underline}** with respect to its
military commitments to Taiwan in the event the latter is attacked.
Whether the United States intervenes is a matter of political judgment
and strategic assessment. Under the Barack Obama administration, the
decision to only offer Taipei upgrades to its aging F-16 A/B planes
suggested to Beijing that de-escalating tensions arising from
differences over Taiwan was the predominant mindset**[. In contrast, the
Trump administration has shown unprecedented willingness to escalate
tensions with China]{.underline}** over political, strategic, and
economic differences. The speech by Vice President Mike Pence last
October at the Hudson Institute and the 2017 National Security Strategy
pulled no punches in identifying China as a comprehensive rival to the
United States. **[If the sale of F-16V planes goes
through]{.underline}**, then, **[it is evidence that the mindset in
Washington with respect to Taiwan has also changed]{.underline}** and is
less accepting of mainland sensibilities and demands. **[Such a sale
would be an indication that preserving de facto Taiwanese independence
is once more considered critical to U.S. and allied strategy when it
comes to keeping the PLA confined to inside the so-called First Island
Chain. That would be a significant blow to Chinese President Xi
Jinping's plans]{.underline}**. In a wide-ranging speech on Taiwan in
January to mark the 40th anniversary of the "Message to Compatriots in
Taiwan" delivered to the 1978 National People's Congress, Xi implied
that "reunification" with Taiwan was a "historic task" he wanted to
achieve during his tenure. A U.S. sale of F-16Vs to Taiwan --- and all
it implies --- makes fulfillment of that task less
likely**[.]{.underline}**

[Is the TRA now DOA?]{.underline} This 40th year since the Congress
passed the Taiwan Relations Act ([TRA]{.underline}) [in response to
then-President Jimmy Carter's unilateral abrogation of the security
treaty between the United States and]{.underline} the Republic of China
([ROC]{.underline}) on Taiwan. The TRA, which the US treats as a compact
with the people of Taiwan, helps define the framework for US relations
with Taiwan. [As China rises, calls to help Taiwan by openly committing
the US to its defense have become an annual rite,]{.underline} with
another from Joseph Bosco in The Hill earlier this month. [Although it
is commonly claimed that the TRA binds the US to defend Taiwan, in fact
it makes no such commitment. Although it is commonly claimed that the
TRA binds the US to defend Taiwan, in fact it makes no such
commitment]{.underline}. Chris Nelson, a former Democratic Party staffer
who was in on its drafting, had this to say in 2007: In fact, the US is
not obligated to defend Taiwan by law, and in the post-9/11 world,
senior Republican officials and military brass have cast considerable
doubt on the US moral obligation, if President Bush were to conclude
that hostilities were the result of actions by Taiwan. In fact,
[although the TRA includes language designed to discourage the use of
force by the PRC against Taiwan,]{.underline} the TRA only obligates the
US to consider arms sales under certain circumstances, period. Take our
word for it, as a junior staff-participant, even this language was
extracted very reluctantly from the State Department at the cost of
considerable blood on both sides. [The strongest language Congressional
friends of Taiwan were able to add talks about a "grave threat" to US
interests in the event of an upset in the peaceful status
quo]{.underline}. That's it...not exactly a mutual defense treaty.
Section 3b of the [**TRA is clear on who makes the determination on arms
and other support for Taiwan: the President and Congress. Taiwan itself
is not involved anywhere in the process, and there is nothing to stop
the US from washing its hands of Taiwan by declaring at any time that
the island has "sufficient" arms.**]{.underline} Thus, **[whether Taiwan
obtains needed weapons or needed defense from the US will always be the
result of political calculus.]{.underline}** The **[TRA has shaped US
policy via its "strategic ambiguity".]{.underline}** Since it does not
prevent the US from defending Taiwan, [it helps deter China, while at
the same time the lack of commitment to Taiwan's defense helps deter
pro-independence forces in Taiwan from suddenly declaring an independent
Taiwan and provoking a war**. Or so the theory goes.**]{.underline}
Chinese Navy [The reality is somewhat different. Throughout most of the
TRA's lifespan, China has lacked the ability to attack and take Taiwan,
meaning that China was sufficiently deterred by Taiwan's armed forces
alone.]{.underline} Hence **[the deterrent effect on China of "strategic
ambiguity" was always overstated b]{.underline}**y its proponents. At
the same time, [with martial law in power, there was never any chance of
Taiwan becoming an independent republic]{.underline}. Nor was the KMT
ever going to declare an ROC that did not include China. Someday future
historians will explore whether "strategic ambiguity" was really just a
euphemistic witticism for the inability of US officials to make up their
minds about what to do with Taiwan. However, [**the rise of Taiwan**
democracy **and** **Chinese power**, both growing rapidly over the last
three decades, **have cast "strategic ambiguity" into stark
relie**f]{.underline}. [China will shortly possess the ability to
meaningfully threaten annexation of Taiwan by force while making US
military intervention extremely costly.]{.underline} At the same time,
the older generation of independence activists in Taiwan, chafing at the
slow pace of progress on independence, is demanding a referendum on an
independent Taiwan with its own Taiwan-centered Constitution. [**Has
"strategic ambiguity" become outmoded? The truth is that it has.** As
China's military continues to grow, the itch to use it will grow. **One
effect of "strategic ambiguity", meaning the US commitment to Taiwan is
vague, is it permits Chinese thinkers to convince themselves that the US
will never intervene**]{.underline} --- that it lacks the spine, the
money, or the military forces necessary to intervene in the Taiwan
scenario. "**[Our enemies won't fight/will be crushed in six weeks" is
an all-too-familiar pattern in the run-ups to major wars.]{.underline}**
**[The deterrent effect of "strategic ambiguity" may now be
lost.]{.underline}** [The US may have given private assurances to China
that it would intervene if China attacks Taiwan]{.underline}, but their
very [privacy]{.underline} [casts]{.underline} [doubt]{.underline} on
them: why would the US keep them private if it really intended to
intervene? After, private promises may also be privately disavowed, at
no public cost to the promiser. **["Strategic ambiguity" also deters
other nations: potential allies, who might come to the aid of the US and
Taiwan in a war.]{.underline}** "Strategic ambiguity" also deters other
nations: potential allies, who might come to the aid of the US and
Taiwan in a war. **[Since they cannot be sure of the US commitment, they
cannot formulate definite, long-term policies.]{.underline}** This
tempts them to cut deals with Beijing. Ending "strategic ambiguity"
would enable the US to make a firm public commitment to defending
Taiwan, an important step in enhancing Japan's role in Taiwan's defense
and in signaling the US commitment to Taiwan to other nations[. **It
would also help pro-US and pro-Taiwan candidates such as current
President Tsai**]{.underline} Ing-wen get (re-)elected [**while making
it more difficult for pro-China candidates to gain the
presidency.**]{.underline} As I write these words, current Chairman and
potential presidential candidate of the pro-China Kuomintang (KMT) Wu
Den-yih has said he would pursue a "peace treaty" with China. Since
Beijing will never sign any document that makes peace with Taiwan
without formal acknowledgement that Taiwan is part of China, Wu is
actually arguing that Taiwan should be quietly annexed to China.
"Strategic ambiguity" enables Wu and other pro-China types to argue that
the US will not defend Taiwan, so Taiwan should do its best to cut a
deal with China before it is violently annexed. Thus, in Taiwan domestic
politics, "strategic ambiguity" is effectively a pro-Beijing policy that
casts doubt on US seriousness.

#### This war escalates quickly-goes nuclear

catastrophe: nuclear escalation and protracted war in Asia", THE JOURNAL
OF STRATEGIC STUDIES, 2017

VOL. 40, NO. 5, 696--730\]

In sum, **[China and the United States are preparing for]{.underline}**
a kind of **[highintensity warfare]{.underline}** that requires
executing rapid and complex operations while simultaneously disrupting
the enemy's command and control. **[Both sides believe
this]{.underline}** operational concept **[can lead to victory at
a]{.underline}** reasonably **[low cost]{.underline}**, and are
tailoring military doctrine to achieve specific political objectives
without risking national disaster. **[What if both sides are wrong?
Great powers often exaggerate their capabilities]{.underline}** **[and
minimize]{.underline}** the importance of **[contingency]{.underline}**
and chance in war. Sometimes **[they launch campaigns with the false
belief that war will be brief]{.underline}** and painless, only to learn
the opposite. Combat against a thinking adversary reveals the limits of
existing capabilities in ways that are impossible to know before the
fact. Strategic interaction during war plays havoc with prewar
expectations, because the combatants do their utmost to undermine the
other. Ambiguous information may not allow either side to judge whether
it is succeeding, or, indeed, whether its forces are actually carrying
out operations as intended. **[Great power wars rarely go according to
plan.]{.underline}** Good strategies thus contain a reasonable margin of
error, and good strategists learn to think about what might go wrong.
Contingency planning is especially important in cases where nuclear
weapons may come into play. This article discusses the relationship
between conventional and nuclear weapons **[in a hypothetical war
between the United States and China.]{.underline}** Both countries have
spent lavishly on new conventional military capabilities. Beijing is
developing "anti-access" systems to make operations dangerous for US
forces in the region, and Washington has responded by refining its
operational approach. In the nuclear realm, China is undergoing a
modernization of its arsenal and has revised its posture, while the
United States has invested in increasingly accurate missiles, lethal
warheads, and remote sensing technologies that enable rapid precision
strikes. These trends may have important and troubling effects on the
dynamics of a potential conventional military confrontation. While
optimists imagine a quick and decisive victory, **[the presence of
nuclear weapons opens the possibility of unexpected scenarios that
neither side can fully control.]{.underline}** The following discussion
describes two such scenarios. The first section discusses the prospects
for nuclear use. The second section discusses the opposite scenario by
looking at the prospects for a protracted conventional war. While
escalation concerns have attracted a great deal of scrutiny, scholars
have paid much less attention to the possibility of a drawn-out fight.
The third section evaluates which scenario is more likely in a US--China
conflict. The conclusion discusses the political and military trade-offs
leaders will face in a future crisis. **[Efforts to win quickly will
increase the risk of nuclear use. Efforts to reduce the risk of
escalation]{.underline}**, on the other hand, will **[increase the risk
of a prolonged war]{.underline}**. Escalation **[What would cause
leaders to cross the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**? In some cases,
the choice may **[be a conscious decision to marry conventional and
nuclear doctrine and incorporate escalatory moves]{.underline}** in
prewar plans. This would be the case if they believe they can execute a
preemptive first strike and disable or destroy the adversary's arsenal.
**[Preemptive attacks are]{.underline}** particularly **[appealing
against states with]{.underline}** incautious or **[irrational
leaders]{.underline}**, especially if they possess small and vulnerable
forces. Deliberate escalation is also possible if **[leaders believe
that they must signal resolve]{.underline}** by indicating their control
at all levels of violence. **[Preparations for conventional war would
transparently include plans for nuclear use]{.underline}** in the case
of certain contingencies. According to this logic, **[a clear signal of
"escalation dominance" is necessary to convince the enemy that the risks
are overwhelming]{.underline}** and the prospects of victory are slim.
If demonstrations of dominance fail, however, then the stronger state
can simply execute its plan in order to defeat the enemy. US leaders in
the Cold War invested in capabilities to enable attacks on enemy nuclear
weapons and associated systems.6 If this was the case in the Cold War,
when the United States faced a superpower adversary with a sprawling
nuclear weapons complex, then leaders today probably remain interested
in counterforce. Open-source **[analyses of US technology, along with
some telling statements from US leaders, reveal an ongoing program for
building and deploying weapons to preempt enemy
escalation]{.underline}** during a conventional conflict.7 They are also
concerned with adversary innovations that complicate counterforce
strikes.8 But suppose that leaders have no intention of using nuclear
weapons. It is one thing to develop impressive technologies, but quite
another to use them, and policymakers may blanch at the real prospect of
authorizing first use. Even in these cases, **[there are
several]{.underline}** theoretical **[pathways to
escalation]{.underline}**. The first is psychological. **[Cognitive
biases may cause leaders to misperceive rival intentions]{.underline}**,
**[mistaking signals of restraint for signs of danger.]{.underline}**
Prewar expectations strongly influence how individuals interpret new
information, and they will ignore or reframe dissonant information so it
fits into their existing beliefs. **[Misperceptions intensify after the
shooting starts]{.underline}**, when information is ambiguous and
incomplete. Carl von Clausewitz dwelt on the problem in the aftermath of
the Napoleonic Wars, noting that intelligence reports were often
contradictory and unreliable "in the thick of fighting." **[Despite
advances in intelligence]{.underline}** and communications, **[the fog
of war remains]{.underline}** an enduring problem. Organized violence is
an iterative process, and each side has incentives to hide its actions
and deceive its adversary. Violence also unleashes intense emotions that
obscure the material effects of battle. Commanders may not understand
whether they are winning or losing, and in lieu of reliable intelligence
they are likely to let passion overtake good judgment. "In short,"
Clausewitz concluded, "most intelligence is false, and the effect of
fear is to multiply lies and inaccuracies." 9 **[Wartime leaders are
prone to attribution bias]{.underline}**, or the belief that their
counterparts are inherently evil. Leaders in conflict **[are likely to
assume the worst]{.underline}** about their rivals or else they would
not have picked a fight in the first place. Attribution bias **[causes
them disregard the notion that their enemies have limited goals and are
willing to accept partial victories]{.underline}**. They are also prone
to reject peace overtures as meaningless gestures at best, or as efforts
to lull them into passivity before escalating the conflict.10 Finally,
prospect theory tells us that individuals will fight harder to avoid
losing a possession than they will to gain something new**[. If leaders
equate settling with losing, then they will be tempted to risk
escalation]{.underline}**. All of **[these psychological pressures are
exacerbated under stress and]{.underline}** tight **[time
constraints]{.underline}**.11 Domestic pressures might lead to
escalation if one or both governments fear that regime change will be
the political penalty for battlefield failure. Escalation is also
possible if the issues at stake are wrapped up in nationalism or
ideologies that inflate the value of the object. Leaders will be hard
pressed to accept defeat in such cases, especially if military outcome
is particularly lopsided and humiliating. Leaders who depend on
particularly hawkish constituencies to remain in power are especially
likely to take new risks even against long odds. Rather than negotiating
an end to the war, they might gamble for resurrection by escalating to
the nuclear level.12 Such a move would not necessarily be irrational.
Instead, resurrection succeeds by shifting the war towards the balance
of interests rather than the balance of capabilities. A retreating
combatant, battered in the early stages of a conflict, may still affect
the enemy's calculation by taking extraordinary risks. Escalation
signals a willingness to fight to the finish and a reminder that it has
powerful interests at stake. Such a strategy is admittedly risky, but it
may be effective, especially if the escalating state is fighting to
defend its own territory against a distant rival. Transforming a
conflict into a test of resolve makes sense when a state is failing the
test of arms.13 Finally, inadvertent escalation may occur when
conventional attacks put the adversary's nuclear force at risk. Under
these conditions, the target state might reasonably worry that the
attack is only the first phase of a larger war. There may be no way to
offer credible reassurances that it is not. Fearing the destruction or
incapacitation of its nuclear deterrent, the target state might face a
"use it or lose it" dilemma. Inadvertent escalation is especially likely
if key command and control nodes are vulnerable or if conventional and
nuclear target sets are indistinguishable. The danger also increases if
military organizations indulge organizational preferences for offensive
action. This encourages planners to err on the side of attacking all
available targets. While it might sense to allow the adversary to retain
some capabilities in order to reduce the incentives for escalation,
planners may bridle at the thought of consciously allowing the enemy to
retain the capacity for attack.14 In recent years, **[China has invested
heavily in capabilities that will complicate US maritime
operations]{.underline}** and threaten US bases in Japan and Guam.
Equipped with a range of anti-access capabilities, China may be able to
deter the United States from intervening in the case of a regional war.
**[If it does intervene, China may attempt to damage or destroy US
assets]{.underline}** or force carrier groups to operate at
prohibitively long distances from the mainland. **[Chinese
doctrine]{.underline}** for using these weapons **[has lagged behind
acquisition]{.underline}**.15 Nonetheless, the appearance of its new
"anti-access/area denial" (**[A2AD) systems caused concern in
Washington]{.underline}**. **[US officials]{.underline}** subsequently
**[unveiled Air--Sea Battle]{.underline}** (ASB), an operational concept
for integrating naval and air assets in order to overcome the entire
range of anti-access capabilities. The concept was announced in spring
2011 by the then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and responsibility
for developing the concept fell to the Air--Sea Battle Office in the
Pentagon. In January 2015, the Department of Defense changed the name of
ASB to the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons,
but there is no indication that the substance has changed.16 And because
ASB has influenced the debate about a hypothetical US--China conflict, I
will continue to use the term here. The Air--Sea Battle Office released
some information about the concept, and leaders from the Navy and Air
Force wrote about it in service publications. The most comprehensive
treatment, however, came in the form of a monograph from the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA). Although it may be ahead of
the Department of Defense (DOD) concept, the CSBA analysis is broadly
consistent with official descriptions.17 ASB envisions two broad phases
in a war against countries like China with advanced anti-access
capabilities. The first is a blinding attack on key facilities,
including long-range weapons that could target US bases and carrier
groups, as well as the radar systems needed to cue them. Kinetic and
electronic attacks would also target Chinese satellites and
anti-satellite weapons. According to the CSBA report, attacks on Chinese
space assets, along with land-based radars and other intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and communications platforms,
would "severely limit China's space-based situational awareness." 18
China would struggle to organize forces after such an attack. Prompt
strikes on Chinese missile launchers and C2 nodes would be equally
important. "Countering or thinning the PLA offensive missile threat is a
principle AirSea Battle line of operation," the report continues. Not
only would the United States regain the advantage, but ASB would also
deny China any chance of a rapid and decisive victory. "Success is
critical in preventing China from achieving a quick 'knock-out blow.'"19
The second phase would seek to deny a Chinese naval breakout. Because of
the vast distances involved in moving forces across the Indian and
Pacific Oceans, these attacks would be required to allow time for US
forces to arrive in theater.20 **[This is an appealing conventional
approach, but it has never been tested against a great power with
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. The danger is that **[ASB increases the
risk that China will use them]{.underline}**. In fact**[, it opens all
three pathways to escalation. ASB deliberately seeks to create
confusion]{.underline}** at the start of the war, **[making it very hard
for the adversary to understand signals of restraint]{.underline}** and
declarations of limited intent. **[Coercion requires not only
threats]{.underline}** but also **[credible assurances]{.underline}**
that the target will not be punished if it complies. **[There is little
reason to comply absent such promises]{.underline}**.21 In addition,
**[all of the psychological problems described above would be activated
if the United States implemented ASB]{.underline}**. In addition to the
danger of misperceptions in the confusing aftermath of a blinding
attack, **[attribution bias would]{.underline}** almost surely **[cause
the Chinese leadership to suspect the worst about the United
States]{.underline}**. **[Prospect theory would]{.underline}** also
likely **[kick in because China would]{.underline}** suddenly **[fear
losing an object of great national value, especially]{.underline}** if
the war is fought **[over Taiwan]{.underline}** and the result is
independence and permanent separation from the mainland. **[ASB would
exacerbate the domestic problem for the Chinese Communist Party,
creating political incentives to use nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** The
Communist Party of China (CCP) long ago gave up its ideological mandate,
replacing communism with a combination of nationalism and economic
growth. In the event of an economic slowdown, the CCP will only have
nationalism to fall back on. In these circumstances, **[the party might
become more risk acceptant, especially]{.underline}** if it is fighting
**[over]{.underline}** a core national interest like
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**.22 **[If it stands on the edge of a
monumentally humiliating loss, the CCP might well escalate the war
rather than risking the end of its regime.]{.underline}** ASB promises
such a loss**[. It is hard to imagine a more humiliating outcome than
being blinded and befuddled, forced to wait as the United States slowly
husbands naval power offshore]{.underline}**. Finally, **[ASB runs the
risk of inadvertent escalation. China has been]{.underline}** steadily
**[moving towards a posture of assured retaliation]{.underline}**. It
seems to believe it can deter other powers with a relatively small
number of nuclear weapons, but only if it can assure the survivability
of its arsenal.23 ASB may remove that sense of security. The **[targets
in the hypothetical first strike would include China's ballistic
missiles and launchers]{.underline}**, as well as space- and
ground-based facilities for targeting and guidance. This means that the
United States would target elements of the People's Liberation Army
Rocket Force (PLARF), which oversees both nuclear armed and conventional
missiles. It also means targeting China's intelligence and C2 networks,
making it harder for leaders to determine whether their nuclear force is
at risk. **[China]{.underline}** has not published a detailed and
authoritative statement on its nuclear doctrine, though its defense
white papers offer clues. **[Historically]{.underline}**, it **[has
chosen to enhance deterrence through ambiguity and mobile
launchers]{.underline}** in place of high numbers of warheads, obscuring
its capabilities to guard what it calls a "lean and effective" force.
While this might plant a seed of doubt in potential attackers, it also
**[increases the danger of mistaken targeting]{.underline}**, and some
analysts believe **[the line between conventional and nuclear
capabilities is getting fuzzier]{.underline}**.24 Moreover, different
variants of China's land-based DF-21 are equipped with both conventional
and nuclear warheads. In the words of a recent open-source assessment of
China's arsenal, "**[This potentially dangerous mix of nuclear and
conventional missiles increases the risk of misunderstanding,
miscalculation, and mistaken nuclear escalation in a
crisis]{.underline}**." 25 Analysts disagree about the level of overlap,
however, and there is evidence that China has taken steps to separate
nuclear and conventional missiles while protecting its retaliatory force
from preemptive attack. A recent survey of Chinese open sources finds
that the majority of missiles are not co-located. Conventional and
nuclear brigades answer to separate commands, and China has invested in
more secure and redundant command and control. That said, both kinds of
brigades may utilize the same C2 infrastructure, and the Central
Military Commission, which commands nuclear forces, can take command of
conventional forces"under special circumstances." Finally, **[Chinese
officials may view an attack on conventional missile brigades as proof
that the United States has the capacity to destroy nuclear
ones]{.underline}**.26 The expansion of US missile defense capabilities
may also affect China's beliefs about the security of its deterrent
force. The United States currently fields a modest national missile
defense capability, with 30 interceptors deployed against
intercontinental ballistic missile attacks. This offers some protection
against small nuclear powers like North Korea but not against larger
ones like Russia and China. Adding more advanced interceptors might make
it harder to make this distinction. China has expressed particular
concern about advances that blur the line between national and theater
missile defenses, thus creating additional doubt about its second-strike
capability.27

consolidated power, he seeks]{.underline}** a **[legacy]{.underline}**
befitting the great emperors of old: the reunification of the Middle
Kingdom. **["The only thing that will make him the greatest leader
in]{.underline}** the Chinese Communist Party's \[**[CCP\] history is to
take Taiwan back]{.underline}**," Shen Dingli, a foreign relations
scholar at Fudan University, told Quartz in 2018. "If he were to achieve
China's reunification, who will say he is second to Mao Zedong or Deng
Xiaoping?\" Xi, whose "China Dream" promises to make China great again,
likely agrees. "**[Fight a war, win a war," is one of his signature
slogans.]{.underline}** In 2017, **[he presided over a military parade

2018. There are signs that **[Xi believes the world will sit

journalists argue that this sentiment is widespread]{.underline}**.
"Mainland Chinese **[public opinion became impatient with Taiwan a long
time ago,"]{.underline}** former director of the Chinese Academy of
Social Science's Institute of Taiwan Studies Zhou Zhihuai wrote in 2017.
"**[Mainland Chinese will be very happy to see the PLA take action to

China will not attack. Many]{.underline}** in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party **[have persuaded themselves that China is too
sensible to take military action]{.underline}**. "The mainland Chinese
leader today is a rational decision maker," Tsai claimed in 2017: Xi
would not provoke a war likely to drag in Japan and the United States.
**[Others]{.underline}** in the DPP **[depict China as too
weak]{.underline}**. "China has too many domestic problems" to capture
Taiwan, professor Fan Shih-Ping wrote in 2017. Taiwan's major opposition
party, the Kuomintang, takes a rosy view of Beijing that rejects the
idea that China might invade. "There is no problem," former president Ma
Ying-jeou declared last year. "Nowadays Beijing's top strategy is
peaceful rise," the journalist Huang Nian wrote in April. "Forceful
reunification would derail it." **[This complacency has led Taiwan to
neglect its armed forces. Taiwan's military suffers from a desperate

China, **[the government ended compulsory military

consider restoring conscription. "The shift to a voluntary military was
a mistake," U.S. officials concluded. **[In an April]{.underline}** 2018
**[poll, more than 40 percent of Taiwanese said they had "no confidence
at all" that their military could defend Taiwan]{.underline}**; but
**[65 percent had convinced themselves that the PRC would not take
military action]{.underline}** against the island; and only six percent
believed that an attack was "very likely." "AMERICA FIRST" IN WASHINGTON
**[The withering of Taiwan's armed forces has increased Taiwan's
military reliance on the United States---just when many in Beijing are

"America first" doctrine has convinced many Chinese that the United
States is now too isolationist to come to Taiwan's
defense]{.underline}**. "America will absolutely sacrifice Taiwan," the
Global Times insisted in 2017. "On the premise of America First ...
**[the United States is not likely to send troops]{.underline}** to
fight for Taiwan." For decades, a U.S. policy of "**[dual deterrence"
has helped prevent conflict]{.underline}** in the Taiwan Strait.
Washington has warned Beijing not to attack Taiwan unprovoked, but
reassured Chinese leaders that the United States would not support
Taiwanese independence. It has told Taipei, in turn, that the United
States would come to its defense---as long as it did not provoke Beijing
by declaring independence. **[Making the policy work has meant treading
a fine line]{.underline}**, but for decades, dual deterrence has allowed
Taiwan to enjoy de facto independence and helped prevent a war with
China. **[Trump has upset that delicate balance]{.underline}**. In
December 2016, **[Tsai called Trump to congratulate him on his victory.
The incoming Trump administration then began to talk of "revisiting" the

recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government
of China, but maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan. **[Beijing was
outraged. Xi refused to talk to Trump until he recommitted the United
States to the One China policy]{.underline}**. In February, Trump
capitulated. In a phone call with Xi, he affirmed that the United States
would continue to support the "One China" policy. "**[Trump lost his
first fight with Xi]{.underline}**," the Beijing scholar Shi Yinhong
bragged to the New York Times. "**[He will be looked at as a paper
tiger."]{.underline}** **[Last year,]{.underline}** however, **[the
pendulum swung back toward confrontation]{.underline}**. In February,

(but not requiring) **[high-level U.S. officials to visit
Taiwan]{.underline}**, and high-level Taiwanese officials to visit the
United States. In the fall, **[Trump started a trade war with China,
generating anxiety]{.underline}** among Chinese nationalists.

some]{.underline}** Chinese **[fear]{.underline}** that
**[Taiwan's]{.underline}** presidential **[election will close Beijing's
window of opportunity]{.underline}** for military action. Many Mainland
Chinese nationalists were disappointed, rather than relieved, by the
pro-independence DPP's poor showing in last November's local Taiwanese
elections. This counterintuitive reaction reveals an alarming calculus:
should a weakened Tsai and the DPP lose the presidency in 2020 to a more
pro-China candidate, the opportunity for "forceful reunification" would
be lost. "What a pity," one Weibo user from Beijing wrote about the
DPP's losses. "We could be further away from the day of reunification."
It is the hated DPP that gives Chinese nationalists a pretext to take
Taiwan back now. **[That disappointment has fed a sense of urgency among
many Chinese nationalists.]{.underline}** "I request that Mainland China
issue a timetable for reunification," one outraged Weibo user wrote in
November. "**[Whether peaceful or forceful, please don't drag this out
again and again." The 2020 U.S. presidential election]{.underline}**
also **[looms]{.underline}** in the minds of Chinese nationalists.
**[Trump looks less likely to win reelection]{.underline}** after
Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms, and **[many]{.underline}**
Chinese **[worry that a Trump loss would make forceful reunification
harder]{.underline}**. **[Trump is seen as]{.underline}** a businessman
and **[isolationist]{.underline}** **[willing to bargain Taiwan
away]{.underline}**. "America will sell Taiwan out in the blink of an
eye," a People's Daily editorial claimed last year. (Few Chinese
recognize the possibility that Trump might respond forcefully to an
attack on Taiwan to rally support at home.) **[A Trump successor,
"forceful reunification" advocates fear, may not be so willing to cut a
deal.]{.underline}** **[Some]{.underline}** in Beijing even **[think
China can retake Taiwan without violence]{.underline}**. China may
"break the enemy's resistance without fighting," Wang Zaixi told the
Global Times in 2017. Just as the Communist Party seized Beijing in 1949
without shooting a single bullet, he argued, China could capture Taiwan
peacefully by surrounding the island, imposing economic sanctions, and
cutting off its oil supply. "No need to shed blood," he concluded.
**[The idea]{.underline}** that China can force reunification without
fighting **[is delusional and dangerous. Tightening the military or
economic noose around Taiwan would]{.underline}** **[likely provoke a
reaction from the United States. Given popular nationalist pressures,
Beijing would then feel compelled to respond. Things could get out of
control fast.]{.underline}** All sides need to wake up to the dangers of
backing into a conflict that few want.

29^th^ 2019, "China warns of long road ahead for deal with U.S. after

[China and the United States will face a long road before they can reach
a deal to end their bitter trade war, **with more fights ahead**
likely]{.underline}, Chinese state media said after the two countries'
presidents held ice-breaking talks in Japan. The world's two largest
economies are in the midst of a bitter trade war, which has seen them
level increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. In a sign of
significant progress in relations on Saturday, Chinese President Xi
Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the G20
summit in Osaka, agreed to a ceasefire and a return to talks. However,
the official China Daily, an English-language daily often used by
Beijing to put its message out to the rest of the world, [warned while
there was now a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement, there's no
guarantee there would be one]{.underline}. "Even though Washington
agreed to postpone levying additional tariffs on Chinese goods to make
way for negotiations, and Trump even hinted at putting off decisions on
Huawei until the end of negotiations, [things are still very much up in
the air]{.underline}," it said in an editorial late Saturday. "Agreement
on 90 percent of the issues has proved not to be enough, and with the
remaining 10 percent where their fundamental differences reside, it is
not going to be easy to reach a 100-percent consensus, since at this
point, [they remain widely apart even on the conceptual
level."]{.underline} Trump also offered an olive branch to Xi on Huawei
Technologies Co, the world's biggest telecom network equipment maker.
The Trump administration has said the Chinese firm poses a national
security risk given its close ties to China's government, and has
lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G
telecommunications infrastructure. The Chinese government's top
diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, in a lengthy statement about G20
released by the Foreign Ministry following the delegation's return to
Beijing, said the Xi-Trump meeting had sent a "positive signal" to the
world. Though problems between the two countries remain, China is
confident as long as they both follow the consensus reached by their
leaders they can resolve their problems on the basis of mutual respect,
Wang said in the statement released late Saturday. [Trump's comments on
Huawei, made at a more than hour-long news conference in Osaka following
his sit-down with Xi, generated only a cautious welcome from China. The
word "Huawei" was not mentioned at all in the top diplomat's appraisal
of G20]{.underline}. Wang Xiaolong, the Foreign Ministry's special envoy
of G20 affairs and head of the ministry's Department of International
Economic Affairs, said if the United States does what it says on Huawei
then China would of course welcome it. "[To put restrictions in areas
that go beyond technology and economic factors will definitely lead to a
lose-lose situation. So if the U.S. side can do what it says then we
will certainly welcome that]{.underline}," Wang told reporters.  The
pause in tensions is likely to be welcomed by the business community,
and markets, which have swooned on both sides of the Pacific due to the
trade war. Jacob Parker, vice-president of China operations at the
U.S.-China Business Council, said returning to talks was good news for
the business community and added much needed certainty to "a slowly
deteriorating relationship". "[Now comes the hard work of finding
consensus on the most difficult issues in the relationship, but with a
commitment from the top we're hopeful this will put the two sides on a
sustained path to resolution]{.underline}." [China's position as the
trade war has progressed has become increasingly strident, saying it
would not be bullied, would not give in to pressure, and that it would
"**fight to the end".**]{.underline} Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat
account run by China's Economic Daily, said the United States was now
aware that China was not going to give in, and that tariffs on Chinese
goods were increasingly unpopular back home. "[**We've said it before -
communication and friction between China and the United States is a
long-term, difficult and complex thing**. Fighting then talking,
fighting then talking, is the normal state of affairs,"]{.underline} it
said.

[President Donald Trump declared the U.S. was "winning" the trade war a
day after reaching a temporary truce with Chinese President Xi
Jinping]{.underline}. On a visit to South Korea following the Group of
20 summit in Japan, Trump said at a news conference that the Federal
Reserve "has not been of help to us at all" in his trade spat with
Beijing. "Despite that, we're winning, and we're winning big because we
have created an economy that is second to none," he said. The White
House has yet to reveal details of Trump's arrangement with Xi, [leaving
uncertainty about how the two countries will proceed.]{.underline} Trump
said after the G-20 meeting that he would hold off indefinitely on
tariffs planned for an additional \$300 billion in Chinese imports while
allowing U.S. companies to continue to do some business with China's
Huawei Technologies Co., one of the country's most prominent firms.
'Catastrophic Mistake' [The move **drew criticism back home**, where
many members of Congress agreed with the administration's assessment
that Huawei is a threat to national security and don't want the company
treated as a bargaining chip.]{.underline} The Commerce Department in
May moved to place Huawei on a blacklist that would cut it off from
American suppliers[. U.S. officials have alleged the company's products
could be utilized for espionage by Beijing, a claim Huawei denies. "If
President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against #Huawei
he has made a catastrophic mistake]{.underline}," Senator Marco Rubio, a
Florida Republican, said in a tweet. In addition to agreeing to re-start
talks, [Trump said Xi had also agreed that China would buy large amounts
of U.S. agricultural goods. **But Chinese official media reports said
only** that **Trump hopes China will import more American goods** as
part of the trade-war truce]{.underline}. Trump offered no further
visibility into his agreement with Xi during both a scheduled meeting on
Sunday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and a surprise summit
with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Demilitarized Zone dividing
the Korean Peninsula. "We are where we are," he said at a news

On its own**[, the trade war is a dramatic change in US-China
relations]{.underline}** --- but that's not the only place where the
Trump administration has flexed its muscles. Let's start with
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**. The little island of 23 million people off
China's coast **[is of great importance to Beijing. China considers the
island --- now a self-ruled democracy --- part of "One China," demanding
that the US and others accept that. The US has consistently refused to
do so,]{.underline}** even as other countries have. In late August, for
instance, El Salvador broke its ties to Taiwan and established
diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration reacted
forcefully, blaming Beijing for "apparent interference" in El Salvador's
politics and suggesting the US may reevaluate its relationship with the
Central American nation. **[Taiwan now only has 17 countries that
recognize it as an independent country.]{.underline}** In June 2017,
**[Trump also approved a \$1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, which
included advanced missiles and torpedoes.]{.underline}** And in March,
he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing senior US officials to meet
with their Taiwanese colleagues in the country, as well as having
Taiwan's officials come to the US. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen

Beijing and is more politically sensitive,"]{.underline}** Fu-Kuo Liu,
an expert at National Chengchi University in Taiwan's capital, Taipei,
told Bloomberg on March 13. **[But there's more.]{.underline}** In May,
the Trump administration told China it could not participate in the Rim
of the Pacific (RIMPAC) international military exercise in Hawaii, which
takes place every other year. The drill allows the 22 nations in RIMPAC
to practice sailing and operating together. The Obama administration
invited China to participate in the exercise twice, in 2014 and 2016, in
part to incentivize China to stop behaving so aggressively in the South
China Sea. But the Trump administration specifically cited Beijing's
South China Sea actions as the reason why it was disinvited. "China's
continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea
only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region," Marine Lt.
Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesperson, told USNI News.
"China's behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of
the RIMPAC exercise." **[Beijing claims the South China
Sea,]{.underline}** which lies on the country's southeast coast,
**[belongs to China]{.underline}**. **[But other countries surround the
body of water,]{.underline}** including Vietnam,
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, and the Philippines, each with its own
competing claims. **[More control of the sea allows for greater access
to resources --- like seafood and energy --- as well as global prestige.
Yet China acts like the South China Sea is an aquatic extension of its
land.]{.underline}** It has built artificial islands, some of which
contain runways for warplanes to land on, and regularly allows Chinese
companies to fish in areas near other countries' coasts.

**[Obama should seize the opportunity created by the emergence of

pursuing a diplomatic strategy]{.underline}** that **[minimizes
conflict, achieves greater mutually beneficial Sino-American
cooperation, and significantly expands trade and investment between the

States to maintain an effective military presence in the Asia Pacific in
coming years, despite defense budget cuts, while also rebalancing
economic and political resources to the region to ensure stability and
mutual prosperity.

#### Warming causes extinction -- triggers tipping points and positive feedbacks which make the planet uninhabitable

**Klein 14**

(Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist,
former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics, member of the
board of directors of 350.org, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs.
the Climate, pp. 12-14)

In a 2012 report, the World Bank laid out the gamble implied by that
target. "**[As global warming approaches and exceeds 2-degrees Celsius,
there is a risk of triggering nonlinear tipping elements]{.underline}**.
**[Examples include]{.underline}** the disintegration of the West
Antarctic ice sheet leading to more rapid sea-level rise, or
**[large-scale Amazon dieback drastically affecting ecosystems, rivers,
agriculture, energy production, and livelihoods]{.underline}**. This
would further add to 21^st^-century global warming and impact entire
continents." In other words, once we allow temperatures to climb past a
certain point, where the mercury stops is not in our control.¶ But the
bigger problem---and the reason Copenhagen caused such great
despair---is that because governments did not agree to binding targets,
they are free to pretty much ignore their commitments. Which is
precisely what is happening. Indeed, emissions are rising so rapidly
that unless something radical changes within our economic structure, 2
degrees now looks like a utopian dream. And it's not just
environmentalists who are raising the alarm. The World Bank also warned
when it released its report that "**[we're on track to a 4-C warmer
world]{.underline}** \[by century's end\] **[marked by extreme heat
waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and
biodiversity, and life-threatening sea level rise]{.underline}**." And
the report cautioned that, "**[there is also no certainty that
adaptation to a 4-C world is possible]{.underline}**." Kevin Anderson,
former director (now deputy director) of the Tyndall Centre for Climate
Change, which has quickly established itself as one of the U.K's premier
climate research institutions, is even blunter; he says **[4 degrees
Celsius warming]{.underline}**---7.2 degrees Fahrenheit---**[is
"incompatible with an organized, equitable, and civilized global
community]{.underline}**."¶ We don't know exactly what a 4 degree
Celsius world would look like, but even the best-case scenario is likely
to be calamitous. **[Four degrees of warming could raise global sea
levels by 1 or possibly even 2 meters by 2100]{.underline}** (and would
lock in at least a few additional meters over future centuries). This
would drown some island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, and
inundate many coastal areas from Ecuador and Brazil to the Netherlands
to much of California and the northeastern United States as well as huge
swaths of South and Southeast Asia. Major cities likely in jeopardy
include Boston, New York, greater Los Angeles, Vancouver, London,
Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.¶ Meanwhile, **[brutal heat waves that
can kill tens of thousands of people]{.underline}**, even in wealthy
countries, **[would become entirely unremarkable summer events on every
continent but Antarctica]{.underline}**. **[The heat would also cause
staple crops to suffer dramatic yield losses across the
globe]{.underline}** (it is possible that Indian wheat and U.S. could
plummet by as much as 60 percent), this at a time **[when demand will be
surging due to population growth and a growing demand for
meat]{.underline}**. And since crops will be facing not just heat stress
but also extreme events such as wide-ranging droughts, flooding, or pest
outbreaks, the **[losses could easily turn out to be more severe than
the models have predicted]{.underline}**. **[When you add ruinous
hurricanes, raging wildfires, fisheries collapses, widespread
disruptions to water supplies, extinctions, and globe-trotting diseases
to the mix, it indeed becomes difficult to imagine that a peaceful,
ordered society could be sustained]{.underline}** (that is, where such a
thing exists in the first place).¶ And keep in mind that these are the
optimistic scenarios in which warming is more or less stabilized at 4
degrees Celsius and does not trigger tipping points beyond which runaway
warming would occur. Based on the latest modeling, it is becoming safer
to assume that **[4 degrees could bring about a number of extremely
dangerous feedback loops]{.underline}**---an Arctic that is regularly
ice-free in September, for instance, or, according to one recent study,
**[global vegetation that is too saturated to act as a reliable
"sink]{.underline}**", leading to more carbon being emitted rather than
stored. Once this happens, any hope of predicting impacts pretty much
goes out the window. And this process may be starting sooner than anyone
predicted. In May 2014, NASA and the University of California, Irvine
scientists revealed that glacier melt in a section of West Antarctica
roughly the size of France now "appears unstoppable." This likely spells
down for the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, which according to lead
study author Eric Rignot "comes with a sea level rise between three and
five metres. Such an event will displace millions of people worldwide."
The disintegration, however, could unfold over centuries and there is
still time for emission reductions to slow down the process and prevent
the worst. ¶ Much more frightening than any of this is the fact that
**[plenty of mainstream analysts think that]{.underline}** on our
current emissions trajectory, **[we are headed for even more than 4
degrees of warming]{.underline}**. In 2011, the usually staid
International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a report predicting that **[we
are actually on track for 6 degrees Celsius]{.underline}**---10.8
degrees Fahrenheit---of warming. And as the IEA's chief economist put
it: "Everybody, even the school children, knows that **[this will have
catastrophic implications for all of us]{.underline}**." (The evidence
indicates that **[6 degrees of warming is likely to set in motion
several major tipping points]{.underline}**---not only slower ones such
as the aforementioned breakdown of the West Antarctic ice sheet, but
possibly more abrupt ones, **[like]{.underline}** **[massive releases of
methane from Arctic permafrost]{.underline}**.) The accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers as also published a report warning businesses
that we are headed for "4-C , or even 6-C" of warming.¶ These various
projections are the equivalent of every alarm in your house going off
simultaneously. And then every alarm on your street going off as well,

become an existential crisis for the human species]{.underline}**. The
only historical precedent for a crisis of this depth and scale was the
Cold War fear that we were headed toward nuclear holocaust, which would
have made much of the planet uninhabitable. But that was (and remains) a
threat; a slim possibility, should geopolitics spiral out of control.
The vast majority of nuclear scientists never told us that we were
almost certainly going to put our civilization in peril if we kept going
about our daily lives as usual, doing exactly what we were already
going, which is what climate scientists have been telling us for years.
¶ As the Ohio State University climatologist Lonnie G. Thompson, a
world-renowned specialist on glacier melt, explained in 2010,
"**[Climatologists]{.underline}**, like other scientists, **[tend to be
a stolid group. We are not given to theatrical rantings]{.underline}**
about falling skies. Most of us are far more comfortable in our
laboratories or gathering data in the field than we are giving
interviews to journalists or speaking before Congressional committees.
When then are climatologists speaking out about the dangers of global
warming? The answer is that virtually **[all of us]{.underline}** **[are
now convinced that global warming poses a clear and present danger to

### 1AC- Trade

#### Now is the key time-arms sales to Taiwan will derail Sino/US trade talks

**WASHINGTON---The U.S. is planning a new effort to help the Taiwanese
government upgrade its military by allowing Taipei to buy billions of
dollars' worth of weapons systems, possibly including more than 100
tanks---a move that has already drawn criticism from Beijing.
[Washington is legally obliged under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to
help the self-ruled island access defensive weapons,]{.underline} but
[such transactions are]{.underline} bitterly [opposed by
Beijing,]{.underline} which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. [A
new round of weapons sales to Taipei would also risk further inflaming
tensions between the U.S. and China as the two countries remain locked
in a trade fight.]{.underline} Multiple people familiar with the
weapons-sales plan told The Wall Street Journal that members of Congress
have been informally notified of the possible arms sale. Ultimately, the
Taiwanese government would have the option to buy some or all of the
items included in the proposal, these people said. Reuters earlier
reported [the potential sale]{.underline}, which [includes Abrams tanks,
antitank missiles, medium-range tactical missiles and portable Stinger
air-defense missiles. The value could be in excess of \$2
billion]{.underline}. A State Department official, citing U.S.
government policy on potential or pending arms sales, declined to
comment on or confirm the terms before formal congressional
notification. Newsletter Sign-up A representative of the Taiwanese
government declined to comment beyond a Ministry of National Defense
statement confirming its request for the weapon systems, in accordance
with U.S. procedures for foreign military sales. In Beijing, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said "China firmly, consistently
and unequivocally opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan." He said he urged
Washington to recognize the sensitive nature of the matter, honor the
One China policy and halt any U.S. arms sales to or military relations
with Taiwan. China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949,
when China's Nationalist government retreated to the island after it was
ousted from the mainland by Communist Party forces. The U.S. officially
adheres to the One China policy, meaning Washington won't establish
formal diplomatic relations with Taipei, but the U.S. and Taiwan view
the sales as crucial for stability in the region[. President Trump
approved a \$1.42 billion arms sale in 2017]{.underline}, and the Obama
administration approved a similar transfer in 2015. With Beijing and
Washington [at a critical point in the high-stakes trade negotiations,
new weapons sales could become a complicating factor in the dispute.
President Trump warned Beijing]{.underline} on Thursday [about another
potential tariff increase on Chinese goods if negotiators fail to reach
a deal. China's Commerce Ministry reiterated that Beijing wouldn't shy
away from responding to any U.S. escalation, though said it is not
seeking a trade war.]{.underline}**

#### Arms sales are the largest internal link to the escalating trade war-only the plan resolves trade tensions and the looming Chinese debt crisis

John **Walcott** Updated, **6-24-2019**, \"The U.S. and China Will
Resume Talks Amid Ongoing Trade War,\" Time,
https://time.com/5611588/china-trade-war-talks/

**[U.S. officials]{.underline}** and some outside experts say they
**[expect]{.underline}** **[this week's meeting]{.underline}**
**[between]{.underline}** President **[Trump and]{.underline}** Chinese
President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[to head off an escalating
trade war and restart trade negotiations between the world's two largest
economic powers.]{.underline}** The two leaders are scheduled to meet on
the sidelines of the June 28 and 29 G20 economic summit in Osaka, Japan,
amid signs that **[both sides are eager to forestall an escalating round
of tariffs that is pushing China deeper into debt]{.underline}** and
prompting U.S. business and political leaders to oppose additional
tariffs on imports from China. **[One sign that the Trump Administration
wants to give economic peace a chance is the fact that]{.underline}**
Treasury Secretary Steven **[Mnuchin,]{.underline}** who is set to
attend the Trump-Xi meeting, **[is holding up a final decision on
selling advanced U.S. tanks and other military equipment to
Taiwan,]{.underline}** said a U.S. defense official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. The Defense Department has notified Congress of
the proposed \$2 billion sale of M1A2 heavy tanks and anti-air and
anti-tank missiles. But the administration has yet to act on the move,
which would anger Beijing in the midst of an effort to restart trade
negotiations. **["We are firmly against U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan,"]{.underline}** Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng
**[Shuang told reporters]{.underline}** on June 4. **["We urge the U.S.
to see the high sensitivity and severe harm of arms sales to
Taiwan."]{.underline}** Another signal of the Administration's
reluctance to anger Beijing right now is its muted response to the
massive protests in Hong Kong to a bill that would allow China to
extradite the territory's residents. The bill has now been suspended.
Some U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill defending Hong Kong's autonomy
on June 14, but the Administration so far has not picked up the issue.
In addition, U.S. Special Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a
trade hawk, sounded a slightly more moderate tone on Capitol Hill this
week, saying, "It's certainly in the interest of both China and the
United States to have some kind of successful agreement. The President
has said he definitely wants an agreement if we can get a great
agreement for America." However, any agreement is likely to be more
modest than what the Administration initially demanded, which included a
rewrite of some Chinese laws that require businesses operating or
investing in China to share intellectual property and Chinese companies
to cooperate with the nation's intelligence services. When Chinese
officials balked at that, Trump responded by raising tariffs on Chinese
goods worth some \$250 billion and threatened to impose tariffs on
another \$300 billion worth of Chinese exports, including cell phones,
computers, toys, and clothing, if China didn't agree to the U.S.
demands. Since then, however, said U.S. trade officials and outside
experts, the temperature seems to have dropped as both countries have
faced the likely consequences of an escalating trade war. One expert,
Kevin Nealer of the Scowcroft Group, an international consulting firm
founded by Brent Scowcroft, President George H.W. Bush's national
security advisor, says **[the most likely outcome of the summit is an
agreement to restart talks]{.underline}**. However, Nealer and China
expert Zack Cooper of the American Enterprise Institute, expect the
Administration to quietly drop its demand that China bow to U.S. demands
that it rewrite its laws or face more tariffs, although the
Administration is unlikely to say that publicly. **["My expectation is
that we've passed the window for a major deal on structural issues and
will instead get a narrow agreement focused on reducing the trade
deficit,"]{.underline}** Cooper said in an email. **[A narrower deal to
head off a trade war is likely to include a Chinese agreement to reduce
its trade surplus with the U.S. by buying more American farm products
such as soybeans and beef, as well as manufactured goods.]{.underline}**
Rather than sticking with the demand that China rewrite some of its laws
and threatening more tariffs, the Administration is exploring other ways
to curb what it says is China's rampant theft of intellectual property,
state subsidies, restrictions on market access, and other unfair trade
practices. Instead of imposing tariffs on entire product categories, for
example, some U.S. officials are considering whether slapping sanctions
on individual companies that violate an agreement could achieve many of
the same ends. National Security Adviser John Bolton has been studying
such an approach, according to two people familiar with the effort. One,
an Administration official, said the approach could have more
international support than imposing more broad tariffs would. **[Both
China and the U.S. now have incentives to strike even a modest agreement
rather than continue an escalating economic battle.]{.underline}** The
Administration's **[trade hawks are facing growing opposition from
business leaders as the 2020 elections approach.]{.underline}** This
week, more than 300 representatives of U.S. companies and trade
associations warned that adding more tariffs on imports from China won't
produce a stronger trade deal and will harm U.S. consumers and the
economy. It's no secret that Trump pays close attention to the stock
market, and this week his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told
reporters: "**[You look at the rally, the stock market, I think the
market says talk is better than no talk."]{.underline}** "There are
better alternatives to address China's policies and practices that would
not have the same adverse impacts on U.S. consumers, businesses, and
local communities," the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued in comments
filed with the Administration. **[China, too, has reasons to play "let's
make a deal."]{.underline}** According to a June 19 blog post by Benn
Steil and Benjamin Della Rocca of the Council on Foreign Relations,
**["the value added by foreign-owned firms in China has plunged since
the trade war began one year ago, with trade fears pushing companies to
shift production abroad", and as a result private spending in China is
contracting. Beijing is counteracting the fall by pushing more domestic
borrowing and restricting foreign lending, they continued. China's
national debt is now equivalent to 254 percent of the country's gross
domestic product, which means the country is "edging closer to debt
crisis",]{.underline}** they said.

From the PRC\'s viewpoint, **[America]{.underline}** often **[stands in

Authorities insist that **[US weapons create a climate encouraging

But Washington and Taipei dispute such claims. They argue that US arms

Taiwan issue by enabling Taipei to negotiate from a position of strength
Indeed, President Ma contends that \"the relaxed tensions accross the

States to Taiwan. Certainly Taiwan will not feel comfortable to go to a

### 1ac-War/Relations

#### Plan solves relations and war---reducing arms sales to Taiwan ends US provocation of China and decades long policy of strategic ambiguity 

**FARS 6/8** (FARS News Agency, 6-8-19, "Washington's Lethal Weapons
Trade in Taiwan Strait,"
<https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980318000929>) RK

Legally speaking, the Taiwan Relation Act obliges the US to provide arms
and material to support the Taiwanese military. At the same time, the US
has a "One China" policy, and recognizes China, not Taiwan, as that one.
Moreover, Taiwan does not legally consider itself independent from
China, and China certainly doesn't see it that way either, viewing a
reunification as an inevitability down the road. Such large US sales,
however, risk shifting the balance of power. At any rate, **[Washington
needs to stop selling arms to the island and labeling it as a "close
defense partner in US-Indo Pacific strategy."]{.underline}** [The latest
salvo is not just about stirring the waters and Taiwan loading up on
American military equipment, or the US meddling in China\'s internal
affairs and breaking from earlier commitments to Beijing]{.underline};
it\'s also about double opportunity. [The official Washington and
Pentagon generals want to project power, police the region, and as a
consequence, exert upon China the full impact of their influence in
every domain.]{.underline} In order to drive the waterway to the edge of
instability, [Washington further sends warships and guided-missile
destroyers to needle and goad China on the pretext of "freedom of
navigation operations."]{.underline} Less publicized in Taiwan,[.
**these provocative moves and other multi-domain engagements on the
peripheries of China are intended to serve America\'s long-term
strategic interests and future war-scape** **They are not there to
protect Taiwan**.]{.underline} Lest we forget, [**America\'s deadly arms
business is a major cause of conflicts and tensions in other parts of
the world,** where many countries spend more on military expenditure and
war than on regional stability and dialogue combined]{.underline}. As
they proceed down this path, [**the growing availability of US arms,
military support, naval presence and other provocative moves are
similarly a major factor in the increase in the level of tensions in
Chinese maritime areas. They provide no security for Taiwan but record
profits for well-positioned American arms manufacturers.** It is
precisely for these geopolitical calculations that US government
officials and Pentagon accountants brag, outrageously, about their
"strong Taipei ties" and "export success" in weapons sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}. Here, [enough]{.underline} [simply isn\'t an
option. **They will try and find major boosts to future arms sales above
and beyond what\'s already been sent, or would be sent, to the clueless
Chinese island.**]{.underline} Taiwan\'s reported purchase of 108 M1A2
Abrams tanks, 1,240 TOW anti-armor missiles, 409 Javelin anti-tank
missiles, 250 Stinger man-portable air defense systems and 66 additional
F-16 fighter jets falls into this line of policy. [The aim is to keep
the destabilization campaign moving forward, reorder the region to
Washington\'s advantage, and weaken any efforts toward reunification and
amity. The confirmation on June 6 by Taipei came after reports said the
US could soon give the green light to sales of tanks and weapons to
Taiwan worth more than 2 billion US dollars.]{.underline} It also came
after senior military officials from Taiwan and the US held their first
meeting last month -- after four decades -- to strengthen military ties.
In this environment, expect no attempts to limit US arms exports to
Taiwan, as the arms sales under the US Taiwan Relations Act are not
based on an assessment of the island\'s defense needs. The US is
responsible for contributing to, rather than impeding, the
militarization of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait[**. Tensions
will not go away as long as the US continues to sell arms to Taiwan and
roil the Chinese territories**.]{.underline} Under the one-China policy
and the three Sino-US joint communiques, however, [Washington is
responsible for revoking all the existing arms export permits to Taiwan
and refraining from issuing any new licenses. The US government cannot
ignore China\'s concerns and calls to end its lethal weapons trade in
the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}

### 1ac-Incrementalism

#### Plan solves-incremental stepping down resolves the tensions between the US and China and maintains a One China policy 

Eric **Gomez**, 9-28-**2016**, \"A Costly Commitment: Options for the
Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship,\" Cato Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship>

**[The]{.underline}** final **[policy option would do away with
America's commitment to Taiwan's defense on the grounds that military
intervention to preserve the island's de facto independence has become
too costly and dangerous for the United States. Stepping down from the
commitment to come to Taiwan's rescue would be a major change in U.S.
policy.]{.underline}** However, other factors unrelated to the U.S.
commitment would still make the use of force unattractive for Beijing.
Taiwan would therefore not be defenseless or subject to imminent Chinese
attack if the United States chose this policy option. **[Without a U.S.
commitment, Taiwan would have to improve its self-defense capability to
deter an attack by China and fight off the PLA if deterrence failed.
Taiwan does face an unfavorable balance of power vis-à-vis China, but
this does not doom Taiwan to military defeat.]{.underline}** In fact,
research by Ivan Arreguín-Toft of Boston University indicates that
large, powerful actors (such as China) have lost wars against weaker
actors "with increasing frequency over time."56 However, in order to
have the greatest chance of success, the weaker side must have the right
military strategy. A head-on, symmetric fight with the PLA would likely
end in disaster for Taiwan, but Taiwan could successfully deny the PLA
from achieving its strategic objectives through the same kind of
asymmetric strategy that China uses to make it difficult for the United
States to defend Taiwan.57 A military strategy emphasizing mobility,
concealment, and area denial would both raise the costs of war for China
and be sustainable, given Taiwan's limited means. Changing Taiwan's
defense strategy would not be a quick or easy task. The most immediate
roadblocks to change are the equipment and mindset of Taiwan's military.
The upper echelons of the military have resisted implementing changes
that could improve their ability to fight a war against the modern PLA.
For example, James Holmes points out that Taiwan's navy "\[sees\] itself
as a U.S. Navy in miniature, a force destined to win decisive sea fights
and rule the waves."58 This is a dangerous mindset given the PLA Navy's
dominance in fleet size, strength, and advanced equipment. The Taiwan
Marine Corps (TMC) is also ill-suited to meeting the threat posed by
China. Instead of being a light, agile force, the TMC is "heavy,
mechanized, and not particularly mobile," reflecting "a glaring failure
by Taiwan's defense establishment to recognize the TMC's essential role
in national defense."59 Overcoming the forces of bureaucratic inertia
will be very difficult, but doing so is necessary if Taiwan can no
longer count on the United States. **[Stepping down from the U.S.
defense commitment would likely involve reductions in U.S. arms sales.
Reductions in the size, quantity, and frequency of arms sales would
likely precede any reductions to the defense commitment because arms
sales are a measurable signal of American support for
Taiwan.]{.underline}** Lyle J. Goldstein of the U.S. Naval War College
points out, **["Arms sales have for some time taken on a purely symbolic
meaning."60 This implies that the negative effects of reducing arms
sales would be relatively small, since China's extant military
advantages are not being offset by U.S. weaponry]{.underline}**.
Additionally**[, stopping the arms sales would not have to be
instantaneous. The United States could reduce arms sales incrementally
to give Taiwan time to improve its self-defense capabilities. One common
argument made by opponents of stepping down from the commitment is that
it is the only thing preventing China from attacking Taiwan. This
argument ignores several important factors that make the use of force
unattractive for Beijing. First, China's reputation and standing in East
Asia would be seriously damaged. Other countries in East Asia would
harshly criticize China's use of force, and would likely take steps to
defend themselves]{.underline}**. For example, countries involved in
territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea have responded
to Chinese aggressiveness by improving their military power and pushing
back politically and diplomatically.61 China's reputational costs for
attacking Taiwan would be very high. Additionally, any military
operation against Taiwan would tie up a great deal of resources. Other
states could take advantage of a Taiwan-focused Beijing to push back
against other Chinese territorial claims. **[Second, the PLA has
problems with both "hardware" (equipment) and "software" (experience)
that would restrict its options for using military force against
Taiwan.]{.underline}**62 The modern PLA has no experience conducting
large-scale amphibious landings, which are complicated operations that
would be very costly to execute against a dug-in defender.63 On the
hardware side, the PLA still lacks the amphibious-lift capabilities and
replenishment ships necessary to mount a successful invasion attempt.64
China has made big strides shifting the relative balance of power in the
Taiwan Strait, but it still faces significant challenges that will take
time to overcome.65 Presently, the PLA is more prepared to push back
against American intervention than to initiate an invasion of Taiwan.
**[How the United States goes about stepping down from its commitment is
important. Suddenly abrogating the TRA would be practically impossible
given the entrenched support for Taiwan within Congress. The most
realistic, feasible approach requires incremental reductions in U.S.
support for Taiwan. Examples of such reductions could include setting a
cap on the value and/or quality of military equipment that can be sold
to Taiwan, changing the TRA to more narrowly define what constitutes a
threat to Taiwan, or requiring Taiwan to spend a certain percentage of
its GDP on defense in order to receive U.S. military support.
Incremental reduction would be easier to sell to U.S. policymakers
because it buys time for Taiwan to improve its defenses, thus increasing
the credibility of the island's military deterrent.]{.underline}** As
discussed earlier, Taiwan's defense industries have proven they can make
high-quality military equipment that meets the island's defense needs.
Taiwan has the ability to develop a robust and effective military
deterrent, but it needs time to overcome existing challenges and address
unforeseen obstacles. If the United States were to reduce its commitment
incrementally, Taiwan's political and military leadership would have the
time to address such challenges. **[Incremental implementation of this
policy option would also provide the United States with opportunities to
learn about Chinese intentions, based on Beijing's
reaction]{.underline}**.66 **[Stepping down from the defense commitment
to Taiwan would be a major accommodation on a core Chinese security
interest. American policymakers should demand some sort of reciprocal
actions from Beijing that reduce the military threat the PLA poses to
Taiwan.]{.underline}** In Meeting China Halfway, Lyle J. Goldstein
explains how **["cooperation spirals" in the U.S.-China relationship can
build "trust and confidence ... over time through incremental and
reciprocal steps that gradually lead to larger and more significant
compromises.]{.underline}**"67 However, **[if Washington takes
accommodating policy positions and Beijing responds with obstinacy or
increased aggression, then American policymakers would likely want to
adjust their approach.]{.underline}** Stepping down from the U.S.
defense commitment to Taiwan, regardless of how it is implemented, is a
controversial policy option that would face significant opposition.
However, there is a strong case to be made for the benefits of such a
policy. **[Taiwan's fate carries much more significance for China than
the United States, and American military superiority over China is
eroding. Although Taiwan faces serious challenges, it would be capable
of maintaining a military deterrent without American support, especially
given the other factors that rein in Chinese aggression. A self-defense
strategy emphasizing asymmetric warfare could raise the costs of
military conflict for China to unacceptably high levels. Most important,
the risk of armed conflict between the United States and China would be
significantly reduced.]{.underline}**

down,\"]{.underline}** said Susan Thornton, a former assistant US
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \"**[Anything
where the US is interfering with Taiwan hits a national third rail.\"
The One China policy]{.underline}** --- under which **[the US
acknowledges China\'s claim that Taiwan is not an independent nation but
rather a part of China]{.underline}**, without taking a side --- was
developed during the Nixon administration to improve US-China relations.
The idea is central to China\'s identity as a modern world power, and
since President Donald Trump took office the US has challenged that
notion repeatedly. Despite protests from Beijing, Trump signed the
Taiwan Travel Act, legislation permitting high-level talks between US
and Taiwanese officials, last year. In May, the US national security
adviser, John Bolton, met with David Lee, one of Taiwan\'s top security
officials. This meeting came just after Taiwan renamed its unofficial
embassy in Washington the Taiwan Council for US Affairs. The old name,
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, neglected to
mention Taiwan or the US. The Trump administration has also sold arms to
Taiwan before, as have previous administrations, **[but this \$2 billion
arms sale digs at a delicate wound during a delicate
time.]{.underline}** It\'s a big sale, even in a world where weapons are
becoming more and more expensive. And though it does not include the
US\'s top fighter jets, **[it is sure to antagonize
Beijing]{.underline}** before the G20 meeting at the end of the month in
Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese heads of state are expected to meet.
On Thursday, **[a Chinese Foreign Ministry representative, Geng Shuang,
responded to the news of the arms sale with a warning,]{.underline}**
according to the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. **\"[We urge the US
side to stop arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} and sever their military
ties,** prudently and **[properly handle Taiwan-related issues, to avoid
serious damage to China-US relations as well as to the peace and
stability of the Taiwan Strait,\"]{.underline}** Geng said. It\'s just
imagination In January 2017, China --- most likely aware that the
incoming US president was unfamiliar with the complexities of US-China
relations --- clarified its position on Taiwan in a rare US media
interview by the Chinese Foreign Ministry official Lu Kang. \"**[Because
this issue touches upon China\'s core interest, by no means is this
something that could be negotiated or used as a bargaining
chip,]{.underline}**\" he told NBC. \" One China policy, 100%.\" The
fight over Taiwan\'s status started in 1949 after the Nationalist leader
Chiang Kai-shek left the mainland for the island when he was defeated by
Mao Zedong\'s Communist forces. To the Chinese, the island\'s
independence is both a product and a reminder of China\'s century of
humiliation, when China was carved up by foreign powers and then thrown
into decades of chaos and civil war after the end of the Qing dynasty.
\"It\'s the mythology they\'ve told themselves for years,\" Thornton
said. In that way **[the One China policy and China\'s economic
nationalism are tied together in the Chinese political]{.underline}**
**[imagination]{.underline}**. That may seem foreign to the US, where
one set of technocrats handles economics and another handles national
security, but the merging of the two interests are a response to the
China\'s lost century. **[And]{.underline}** both **[are being tested by
the Trump administration]{.underline}**. xi trump Chinese President Xi

Taiwan as an encroachment on its sphere of influence]{.underline}**. And
the US sees Chinese involvement in the Caribbean similarly. Back in

ambitions, invoking the Monroe Doctrine. \"Latin America does not need
new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people,\" he
said. \"China\'s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the
past. It doesn\'t have to be this hemisphere\'s future.\" **[All of this
matters for Taiwan because the more involved a country is with China,
the more pressure China puts on it to wipe Taiwan off the
map.]{.underline}** Earlier this year the Dominican Republic dropped its

president, **[Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen, **[faces an uphill battle for

\"**[is that selling weapons to Taiwan helps political candidates show

### A2: China wont fight 

#### China views unification as an existential part of their identity-pushes for Taiwan independence are the only way China goes to war 

**Press 19** \[Press, News organization, 6/3/19, Taiwan lashes back at
Chinese defense minister\'s threats,
https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-lashes-back-chinese-defense-ministers-threats-045141553.html\]
KS

Taiwan lashed out at the Chinese defense minister\'s renewed threat to
use force to assert China\'s claim to the island, accusing Beijing of
creating unease in the region and seeking to \"expand its hegemony.\" A
statement from the Cabinet\'s Mainland Affairs Council targeted comments
Defense Minister Wei Fenghe made in Singapore on Sunday in which he said
China would \"resolutely take action\" to defend its claim to Taiwan and
the South China Sea. The council asserted later Sunday that Taiwan has
never been a part of the People\'s Republic of China and would never
accept Beijing\'s threats. It accused China of \"challenging
international norms and order\" and said Beijing\'s claim to seek
peaceful development had been recognized internationally as \"a lie of
the ages.\" \"**[We need to remind the public that the Chinese Communist
Party is practicing anti-democracy, anti-peace between the two sides of
the strait and further resorting to war.]{.underline}** This is the
**[main cause of the tension in the Taiwan Strait and the
region]{.underline}**, and it is the source of danger and provocation
against peace and stability,\" the statement said. It said **[Taiwan,
which is heavily dependent on U.S. arms for its defense, would continue
to strengthen its armed forces]{.underline}**, \"defend its national
sovereignty and democratic system,\" and uphold the right of the
island\'s 23 million people to \"freely choose their own future.\" The
sides split amid civil war in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek moved his
Nationalist government to Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover of the
mainland. Taiwan had been a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945. **[China
considers annexation of Taiwan to be an inevitability]{.underline}**,
and in his speech, Wei said Beijing was prepared to fight any opponent
to make that happen. \"China must be and will be reunified. We find no
excuse not to do so. **[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the
Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs, at all costs,
for national unity]{.underline}**,\" Wei said. China has boosted such
muscle flexing since the 2016 election of independence-leaning Taiwanese
President Tsai Ing-wen, who has infuriated Beijing by refusing to
endorse its contention that Taiwan is a part of China. Surveys show
solid majorities of Taiwanese favor maintaining the current state of
de-facto independence and reject China\'s call for unification with
Beijing under the \"one country, two systems\" framework now applied to
Hong Kong. **[China has also upped diplomatic pressure by poaching
several of the island\'s dwindling number of allies and barring
Taiwan\'s representatives from international gatherings, no matter how
non-political in nature. It has also discouraged Chinese tourists from
visiting the island and sought to win over Taiwanese investors by
offering them many of the same terms and conditions offered to native
Chinese.]{.underline}**

KS

**[Tensions between Taiwan and the People's Republic of
China]{.underline}** (PRC) are **[surging to an alarming
extent]{.underline}**. The latest indicator is the recent exchange of
heated rhetoric between Gen. Wei Fenghe, China's Minister of National
Defense, and Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, the Taiwanese
government's chief policymaking body dealing with cross-strait
relations. **[As Taiwan's self-proclaimed protector,
Washington]{.underline}** should be **[extremely worried about these
developments.]{.underline}** Speaking on June 1 at the Shangri-La
Dialogue, an annual multilateral conference on Pacific security issues,
Wei warned against efforts either in Taiwan or foreign countries to
thwart China's goal of reunification. Moreover, "any underestimation of
the PLA's resolve and will is extremely dangerous." Wei added ominously
that, "**[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese
military will have no choice but to fight at all costs, at all costs,
(sic.) for national unity]{.underline}**. If the PLA cannot even
safeguard the unity of our motherland, what do we need it for?" The
Mainland Affairs Council responded with equally harsh and uncompromising
language. In a statement issued the following day, the council
reasserted that Taiwan has never been a part of the PRC and would never
accept Beijing's control or threats. It accused China not only of
"challenging international norms and order," but added the gratuitous
slap that Beijing's claim to seek peaceful development was "a lie of the
ages." Lest anyone not fully grasp the extent of Taipei's hostility
toward the PRC, the statement went on: "We need to remind the public
that the Chinese Communist Party is practicing anti-democracy,
anti-peace between the two sides of the strait and further resorting to
war. This is the main cause of the **[tension in the Taiwan Strait and
the region]{.underline}**, and it is the source of danger and
provocation against peace and stability." The vitriolic exchange
constituted a worrisome escalation of the animosity between Taipei and
Beijing that has been roiling for the past three years. The victory of
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan's 2016
elections dashed any hopes Chinese leaders had that the burgeoning
economic ties with the mainland would translate gradually into increased
Taiwanese popular support for political reunification. **[Anger at that
strategy's failure led Beijing to revive a campaign to increase Taiwan's
diplomatic isolation by poaching the few small nations that still
maintain formal relations with Taipei]{.underline}**. The
**[PRC']{.underline}**s menacing **[military activities also
increased]{.underline}**. Chinese war games in and around the Taiwan
Strait have soared since 2016. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's
2019 report to Congress also concludes that Beijing is building up its
ground, air, and naval forces to achieve a more robust capability to
invade Taiwan. Anger at Beijing's treatment of Taiwan has led to
congressional and executive branch measures to strengthen Washington's
backing for Taipei. A major step occurred in March 2018 when President
Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), which encouraged
high-level U.S. officials to meet with their Taiwan counterparts.

<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship>

**[Maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait will become more
complicated]{.underline}** as a result of two trends in cross-strait
relations and one higher-level trend. First, **[a distinct identity is
taking hold in Taiwan]{.underline}**; the people living there see
themselves as Taiwanese instead of Chinese. Surveys conducted in 2014
showed that "**[fewer than 4 percent of respondents \[in Taiwan\]
self-identified as solely Chinese]{.underline}**, with a clear majority
(60 percent) self-identifying solely as Taiwanese."75 **[A unique
Taiwanese identity is dangerous to Beijing because it makes China's
ultimate goal of reunification more difficult, especially if the
identity issue leads to greater political support for
independence]{.underline}**. Thankfully, the Taiwanese people have been
very pragmatic and have not yet made a significant push for de jure
independence.76 Second, if China's economy continues to slow down
Beijing could become more aggressive toward Taiwan. A parade of doom and
gloom headlines reveal the weaknesses of China's economic miracle. The
Chinese stock market experienced downturns in August 2015 and January
2016 that affected global financial markets.77 China Labor Bulletin, a
Hong Kong-based workers' rights group, recorded more than 2,700 strikes
and worker protests throughout China in 2015---more than double the
1,300 recorded the year before.78 In February 2016, Reuters reported
that 1.8 million workers in China's state-owned coal and steel companies
will be laid off in the coming years.79 This is not to say that China's
economy is in imminent danger of a catastrophic collapse. However,
**[the political instability resulting from economic troubles could
create an incentive for Beijing to act aggressively to burnish the
Chinese Communist Party's image at home.80 Exacerbating this risk is the
rise of nationalist forces within Chinese society that could push the
government into a more aggressive cross-strait policy.]{.underline}**
**[Such forces played an important role in the government's heavy-handed
response to 2014's Occupy Central protests in Hong
Kong]{.underline}**.81 Economic problems coupled with **[aggressive

for the United States.]{.underline}**

For China, the first of its two "centennial anniversaries"---in 2021
(100 years since the Chinese Communist Party's (CPP) founding) and 2049
(100 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China)
---arrives in just four years. Although Beijing has publicly disavowed
any timeline for unification with Taiwan, there is little question that
CCP leaders would prefer the issue to be settled by then, or at least to
oversee sufficient progress to justify its stewardship of the country's
revitalization. **[Although the two sides are more economically
interdependent than ever, the prospects for "peaceful unification"
continue to dim]{.underline}**. [China is fighting the trends that have
everywhere favored the strengthening of subnational
identities.]{.underline} The [proliferation of digital technologies and
social media, the inability of national governments to satisfy the
proliferating demands of their peoples, and the increasing mobility of
populations have weakened the loyalty claimed by national and
supra-national governments and strengthened regional and ethnic
identities]{.underline}. In China alone, Beijing struggles to maintain
the loyalty of its people in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. [In Taiwan,
the pull of regional identity and declining popular identification with
China has fueled the island's shrinking support for
unification]{.underline}. The looming collapse of the once-dominant
Kuomintang (KMT)---a party committed in theory to a unified China---and
the electoral strength of the pro-independence Democratic People's Party
([DPP) serve as the most obvious manifestations of these
trends]{.underline}. But polls also reveal the extent of disaffection
with China. Scarcely 10 percent of Taiwan\'s people support unification.
A widening generational divide suggests support will continue to fall,
since 80 percent of Taiwan\'s youth between ages 20-29 oppose
unification. China\'s official news service, Xinhua, has delighted in
trumpeting polls that showed beleaguered Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen
falling in popularity. But [Beijing can take little comfort in the fact
that one of the few things that have proven consistently less popular in
Taiwan than Presidents Tsai or KMT predecessor Ma Yingjeo has been the
idea of unification with China. **Nothing Beijing has tried to woo or
coerce Taiwan has worked**]{.underline}. Chinese [officials have
expanded trade and investment opportunities, encouraged cultural
exchanges, and warmed political contacts between]{.underline} the
Chinese Communist Party ([CCP]{.underline}) and the KMT---all to no
avail. In recent years, a clearly frustrated Beijing has turned to
coercion. The Chinese media has aired retired PLA generals' threats of
invasion and stepped up publicity for high-profile military exercises
designed to intimidate Taiwan. In January 2017, the PLA sailed its
aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait in a move widely seen as a
warning to Taiwan in the wake of President Tsai's phone conversation
with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Yet support for unification in
Taiwan continues to dwindle. [A clearly impatient Xi Jinping has
dispensed with sentimental illusions designed to entice Taiwan's support
for unification]{.underline}. Where his predecessors cultivated
ambiguity about the meaning of "one China" when discussing the "1992
Consensus" with KMT officials[, Xi has explicitly equated the Consensus
with the Hong Kong-like "One China, Two Systems"
arrangemen]{.underline}t. As explained by Taiwan Affairs Office Director
Zhang Zhijun, Xi has determined that "one country, two systems will be
the fundamental arrangement of the nation's system after reunification."
Chinese officials no longer even bother to disguise their intent to
purge the island of its democratic sentiments upon unification. In a
chilling euphemism, Zhang stated that Beijing seeks a "spiritual
matching" between the peoples of the two sides of the Strait to
"strengthen solidarity" and enable "cohesion and the materialization of
long term stability." He explained that this requires the "proper
handling of the systemic and ideological differences between the two
sides of the Strait after reunification." [This language amounts to a
pledge by Beijing to stamp out views at odds with Chinese unification
and CPP ideology.]{.underline} Not surprisingly, [the blunt approach has
failed to win over Taiwan]{.underline}. Indeed, some Chinese experts and
observers have grown pessimistic regarding cross-strait relations. Wang
Zaixi, former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, stated in
December, 2016, that the "possibility of peaceful unification continues
to decline." [For those determined to compel Taiwan's unification,
military subjugation remains a last option that, on the surface, appears
viable]{.underline}. [The PLA's modernization gains have been
impressive, while Taiwan's military has atrophied]{.underline}. The
anti-access, area denial ([A2AD]{.underline}) [challenge posed by
China's formidable arsenal raises questions about the feasibility of
U.S. involvement in a China-Taiwan conflict]{.underline}. However, a
large-scale opposed amphibious assault remains among the most difficult
of military operations. The PLA also would have to plan to fight the
military of the world's superpower, the U.S., in such a scenario while
controlling escalation. Moreover, the PLA continues to lack key
capabilities---most notably, amphibious lift. For any military these
factors would make the prospects of success slim at best, but the
difficulty is compounded by the PLA's inexperience---it last fought a
war in 1979. China has simpler, less risky military options available to
it, but these are of doubtful effectiveness. Missile bombardment and
blockades can inflict serious damage, but historic experience suggests
that such coercive actions are more likely to inflame resentment and
harden Taiwan's stance against China. Only invasion, occupation, and the
installation of a more compliant political authority can ensure
unification, and for now this remains an extremely high-risk course of
action. [Even if the PLA could pull off an invasion and defeat U.S.
intervention, military subjugation of Taiwan would only worsen China's
security environment]{.underline}. The most significant problem facing
Chinese leaders would be the U.S. and regional response. Several trends
raise the probability that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could lead to
subsequent regional wars. First, growing Chinese power has spurred wary
regional rivals to step up military and diplomatic cooperation with one
another and with the U.S. Second, regional polarization has encouraged
each rival disputant with China to view how Beijing handles any dispute
as possibly presaging its approach to other disputes. Military
aggression against Taiwan could crystallize fears and prompt a coalition
to contain, and possibly fight, China. [Stepped up regional cooperation.
Growing Chinese power has driven the polarization of the region,
spurring a zero-sum contest for influence with China's rivals,
principally the U.S. and Japan]{.underline}. While struggling to
maintain a stable bilateral relationship and contain tensions, China and
the U.S. increasingly compete for diplomatic influence and economic
opportunities. The growing rivalry between China and Japan has overlaid
the one between China and the U.S. China and Japan routinely compete
over investment projects, diplomatic influence and for control of the
disputed Senkaku Islands. China and Vietnam have feuded over Chinese
actions in the South China Sea, and Indian wariness of China has grown
as well. Facing growing security tensions, Asian countries are arming
up. In 2015, the region led the world in defense spending. [In this
environment, countries are gravitating to either China or its
rivals]{.underline}. Some countries, such as the Philippines under
President Rodrigo Duterte and other countries in ASEAN, oscillate
between the two sides. [Others]{.underline}, such as Vietnam, Australia,
and India, [have quietly stepped up collaboration with Japan and the
U.S. while not rupturing ties with China]{.underline}. Regional
polarization has increased the receptiveness of China's rivals to any
potentially useful ally. Considering its economic heft, geographic
proximity, and military capability, Taiwan makes for an attractive
candidate. [The Trump-Tsai phone call gained widespread media attention,
but other signs of warming U.S.-Taiwan relations can be seen in the
decision to increase military exchange]{.underline}s. Japan and Taiwan
have built a popular affinity for one another to strengthen bilateral
relations as well. For example, the new U.S.-Japan defense guidelines in
2015 agreed to open the possibility of Japanese support to U.S. forces
in conflict, including in a Taiwan Strait scenario. Japan also recently
provoked China's ire by renaming its office in Taipei from the "Office
of International Exchange" to the "Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association."
India and Taiwan have quietly stepped up ties in recent years through
trade and political visits. Sensing opportunity, Tsai announced a policy
initiative focused on strengthening the island's ties to South Asia,
Southeast Asia, and Oceania. [Taiwan and China's other
disputes]{.underline}. **[China's growing power and aspirations to lead
the region mean Taiwan's fate can no longer be viewed solely as a subset
of Chinese politics, no matter how much Beijing may insist
otherwise]{.underline}**. More than in the case of Hong Kong, Beijing's
treatment of Taiwan carries implications for its dealings with any
country facing a territorial dispute with China. There are three reasons
why this is so. First, [China has defined its territorial disputes with
other powers in similar terms, invoking the "core interests" of
territory and sovereignty in each case]{.underline}. Second, [China has
declared that it intends to fully control its disputed
claims]{.underline}. Xi has pledged "no compromise" on issues of Chinese
territory. The question facing Chinese decision makers thus concerns
[how to control disputed territory, not whether to seek
control]{.underline}. Third, [China has pledged to settle disputes
peacefully. A China that invades Taiwan to resolve its sovereignty
status could be viewed as having abandoned this commitment. Countries
could see aggression as evidence that Beijing might attack any country
that opposed Chinese demands]{.underline}. In such a situation, [Japan
would rightly fear that China might use force to seize control of the
Senkakus.]{.underline} India, Vietnam, and the Philippines would
similarly have cause to fear Chinese intentions regarding disputed
territories. Even countries not involved in a territorial dispute would
have cause to fear Chinese power. [The U.S. would probably experience a
strong demand from Asian countries to engage in greater involvement
throughout Asia. An attack on Taiwan could thus dramatically raise the
possibility of an anti-China coalition and lead to a serious
deterioration in China's security environment. If a regional war
subsequently broke out, China would struggle to maintain economic growth
and social stability, endangering its aspirations for national
revitalization.]{.underline} Conclusion [Despite declining prospects for
peaceful unification by 2020, China faces serious constraints on its
ability to invade and subjugate Taiwan]{.underline}. [The geostrategic
risks attending regional polarization have narrowed the range of
acceptable Chinese justifications for attack]{.underline}. China might
experience fewer international repercussions if it attacked a Taiwan
that suddenly declared independence. However, in most scenarios, neither
the U.S. nor any other major power would recognize Taiwan, rendering
such a declaration pointless. The futility of such a gesture is perhaps
why popular support in Taiwan for de jure independence remains minimal.
More plausible is the idea that Beijing might justify an attack on the
ground that [Taiwan has continued to resist demands that it adhere to a
"one China" policy or other political demands]{.underline}. Recent media
reports claim that Beijing is considering revising the Anti-Secession
Law to create such red lines. Such laws could lay the legal and moral
groundwork to justify military action. [But warfare under these
conditions carries high risks.]{.underline} Countries in Asia could
reject such a justification as little more than political cover for
aggression. After all, [left unopposed, China could be tempted to employ
a similar approach]{.underline}---i.e., imposing difficult to meet legal
and moral demands, followed by military attack---[to coerce neighbors
into surrendering any territory that Beijing coveted. China is not
without options to flex its muscles]{.underline}, however. [Beijing has
at its disposal many tools it could use to make life difficult for the
people of Taiwan]{.underline}. It can step up coercive military,
economic, and political measures that damage economic growth and create
instability. [Beijing may hesitate to use these weapons, since
inflicting hardship and coercing the people of Taiwan may gratify
anxious nationalists but will do little to reconcile the people of
Taiwan to China]{.underline}. However, it is possible that a [frustrated
Beijing lacking better options could apply pressure to coerce political
gestures that at least bolster the illusion of progress towards
unification. Taiwan's increasing engagement with China's rivals could
well come at the price of a more friction-filled relationship with
Beijing.]{.underline} [The U.S. should consider enhanced engagement to
ensure stability across the Straits]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[Washington should continue to reassure Taiwan that it will fulfill its
obligations per the Taiwan Relations Act.]{.underline} On the other,
**[it should reassure China that the U.S. continues to uphold the One
China policy and does not support Taiwan independence]{.underline}**.
[Taiwan may face a more turbulent relationship with Beijing, but if it
proceeds cautiously, it can be reasonably confident in maintaining its
autonomy for many more years.]{.underline}

purview of the US--Japan Security Treaty. While no such authoritative
statement has been made regarding the Spratly Islands, a treaty alliance
with the Philippines and clear national interests in freedom of
navigation connect US interests to developments there. Finally, the
situation on the Korean peninsula could spark crises between Beijing and
Washington. While opportunity for cooperation exists, a war in Korea
would likely find United States forces engaged in combat operations well
north of the 38th parallel near China's border. None of these potential
flashpoints has an obvious nuclear component, but **[the shifting
conventional balance means that if the United States and China become
engaged in a military conflict, the US military can no longer rely on
overwhelming conventional superiority]{.underline}**. As one recent
study noted: **[The PLA is not close to catching up to the U.S. military

### A2: Arms sales don't hurt relations 

#### Arms sales to Taiwan in this environment would tank relations

An informal notification of the proposed sale has been sent to the U.S.
Congress, the four sources said on condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to speak about the possible deal. The potential sale
included 108 General Dynamics Corp M1A2 Abrams tanks worth around \$2
billion as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft munitions, three of the
sources said. **[Taiwan has been interested in refreshing its existing
U.S.-made battle tank inventory]{.underline}, which includes M60 Patton
tanks[. China says seriously concerned about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan]{.underline},
which China deems its own and has never renounced the use of force to
bring the self-ruled island under its control[. Taiwan President Tsai
Ing-wen said in March Washington was responding positively to Taipei's
requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of
pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan
but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend
itself.]{.underline} China and the United States are engaged in a fierce
trade war[, with clashes over Taiwan and the South China Sea
exacerbating tensions.]{.underline} [A spokesman for the State
Department, which oversees foreign military sales,]{.underline}** said
the U.S. government does not comment on or confirm potential or pending
arms sales or transfers before they have been formally notified to
Congress. The congressional notifications included a variety of
anti-tank munitions, including 409 Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin
Corp-made Javelin missiles worth as much as \$129 million, two of the
sources said. The notifications also included 1,240 TOW anti-tank
missiles worth as much as \$299 million, one of the sources said. There
were also 250 stinger missiles worth as much as \$223 million in the
notification, the source said. Stingers are often used in portable
anti-aircraft weapons systems. Taiwan's Defense Ministry confirmed it
had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding
normally. **[The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to
defend itself helps Taiwan's military to raise its combat abilities,
consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security]{.underline} partnership and
ensures Taiwan's security, the ministry said in a statement. The
[Chinese government condemned the planned sale. "We are severely
concerned about the U.S. move and are firmly against U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan,"]{.underline}** Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng **[Shuang told a
daily news briefing in Beijing]{.underline}**. **[China urges the United
States to stop arms sales to Taiwan and prudently deal with issues
relating to Taiwan to prevent harm to bilateral relations and peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait,]{.underline}** he added. U.S. President
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**'s administration **[rolled out
a]{.underline}** long-awaited **[overhaul of U.S. arms export policy in
2018 aimed at expanding sales to allies,]{.underline}** saying it would
bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home. Trump's
trade adviser Peter Navarro was one of the administration's architects
of that policy. Navarro, **[wrote about the possible sale of tanks to
Taiwan in a March opinion column in the New York Times ahead of a
presidential trip to the Lima]{.underline},** Ohio, plant where they are
made. At a low point, the U.S. Army had only one tank coming from the
plant a month, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said during an April
conference call with investors but said "we'll be rolling out 30 tanks a
month by the end of this year," partly because of international orders.
The Pentagon announced last week it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made
by Boeing Co**,** to the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Vietnam for \$47 million. The drones would afford
greater intelligence-gathering capabilities, potentially curbing Chinese
activity in the region. **[China claims almost all of the strategic
South China Sea and]{.underline}** frequently lambastes the United
States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied
islands. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, **[Taiwan and
Vietnam all have competing claims]{.underline}.** China's Defense
Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States at the Shangri-La Dialogue
in Singapore last weekend not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan
and the South China Sea. Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
told the meeting that the United States would no longer "tiptoe" around
China's behavior in Asia. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, responding to the
Reuters report of planned the new arms sale, said Wei's "threatening"
comments and recent Chinese military drills near Taiwan showed the
importance of its need to strengthen its defensive abilities. "Going
forward our government will continue to deepen the close security
partnership between Taiwan and the United States," it said.

On its own**[, the trade war is a dramatic change in US-China
relations]{.underline}** --- but that's not the only place where the
Trump administration has flexed its muscles. Let's start with
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**. The little island of 23 million people off
China's coast **[is of great importance to Beijing. China considers the
island --- now a self-ruled democracy --- part of "One China," demanding
that the US and others accept that. The US has consistently refused to
do so,]{.underline}** even as other countries have. In late August, for
instance, El Salvador broke its ties to Taiwan and established
diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration reacted
forcefully, blaming Beijing for "apparent interference" in El Salvador's
politics and suggesting the US may reevaluate its relationship with the
Central American nation. **[Taiwan now only has 17 countries that
recognize it as an independent country.]{.underline}** In June 2017,
**[Trump also approved a \$1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, which
included advanced missiles and torpedoes.]{.underline}** And in March,
he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing senior US officials to meet
with their Taiwanese colleagues in the country, as well as having
Taiwan's officials come to the US. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen

Beijing and is more politically sensitive,"]{.underline}** Fu-Kuo Liu,

told Bloomberg on March 13. **[But there's more.]{.underline}** In May,
the Trump administration told China it could not participate in the Rim
of the Pacific (RIMPAC) international military exercise in Hawaii, which
takes place every other year. The drill allows the 22 nations in RIMPAC
to practice sailing and operating together. The Obama administration
invited China to participate in the exercise twice, in 2014 and 2016, in
part to incentivize China to stop behaving so aggressively in the South
China Sea. But the Trump administration specifically cited Beijing's
South China Sea actions as the reason why it was disinvited. "China's
continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea
only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region," Marine Lt.
Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesperson, told USNI News.
"China's behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of
the RIMPAC exercise." **[Beijing claims the South China
Sea,]{.underline}** which lies on the country's southeast coast,
**[belongs to China]{.underline}**. **[But other countries surround the
body of water,]{.underline}** including Vietnam,

competing claims. **[More control of the sea allows for greater access
to resources --- like seafood and energy --- as well as global prestige.
Yet China acts like the South China Sea is an aquatic extension of its
land.]{.underline}** It has built artificial islands, some of which
contain runways for warplanes to land on, and regularly allows Chinese
companies to fish in areas near other countries' coasts.

### A2: No impact to relations 

#### US/China trade relation impact every sector of the economy and the US hegemony including rare earth metals. Dollar dumping, and Freedom of Navigation in the South China Sea 

**Reuters** Editorial, **6-28**-2019, \"Explainer: U.S.-China trade
war,\" U.S.,

President Donald **[Trump and]{.underline}** Chinese President
**[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[will seek to revive talks to end a trade
war when they meet]{.underline}** on Saturday on the sidelines of a
Group of 20 summit in Japan. The session will be the first time they
have met since the last G20 summit in late November in Buenos Aires.
Negotiations between the two sides on trade broke down in May. Since
then, the trade war has escalated with both sides imposing higher
tariffs on the other, and Trump declaring Chinese telecommunications
giant Huawei Technologies \[HWT.UL\] a national security threat. Trump
has said he could hit China with more tariffs, depending on the outcome
of the meeting with Xi. Neither side has softened its position ahead of
the meeting. The following are some other possible pressure points for
each side: **[RARE EARTH METALS Xi visited a rare earth firm in southern
China in May, fueling speculation that China could cut off supplies of
the metals, a key ingredient in high-technology consumer electronics and
military equipment, to the United States as part of the trade war. China
supplies 80% of U.S. rare earths.]{.underline}** HIKING TARIFFS FURTHER
China could impose tariffs on around \$10 billion of U.S. goods that as
yet carry no retaliatory tariffs. Beijing removed some tariffs on
American car imports in December, and could reimpose them. China could
raise tariffs from 25 percent on some U.S. goods such as soybeans. China
was the top buyer of U.S. soybeans until the trade war, which came close
to halting the flow altogether. If it raises tariffs again, Chinese soy
importers will seek more supplies from Brazil and elsewhere, as they did
in 2018, which would hurt U.S. farmers. These are targeted tariffs,
aimed at the U.S. farming community that helped Trump win the presidency
in 2016. High-tech items, such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment
and chips, would be unlikely to feature on a list for higher tariffs
because China cannot easily find alternatives. China has so far spared
Boeing Co (BA.N) passenger jets, its single most valuable U.S. import,
from tariffs. Chinese carriers are expanding rapidly to meet rising
demand, so tariffs on Boeing could slow development of the domestic
travel industry. China could buy more aircraft from France's Airbus
(AIR.PA) instead of Boeing, which would make it more reliant on Europe
for a few years until it completes development of homegrown commercial
aircraft, the COMAC C919. DUMPING TREASURIES **[China is the biggest
holder of U.S. government debt, with about \$1.12 trillion in U.S.
Treasuries. Beijing buys Treasuries as a safe haven for foreign exchange
reserves. The editor in chief of China's influential Global Times
tweeted in May that "many Chinese scholars are discussing the
possibility of dumping U.S. Treasuries and how to do it specifically." A
sell-off would hurt U.S. markets, driving up interest rates and pushing
up borrowing costs. The U.S. Federal Reserve could lower its benchmark
interest rate or buy debt to counter the move. China sold the most
long-dated U.S. Treasuries in almost 2-1/2 years in March. But most
China experts say Beijing is unlikely to undertake a big sell-off
because that would lower the value of China's foreign exchange reserves.
China would be hard-pressed to find a safe alternative investment with a
good yield.]{.underline}** DEVALUATION Some analysts have floated the
idea of a one-off devaluation of the Chinese currency to make the
country's exports more competitive despite U.S. tariffs. But that would
spook foreign and domestic investors and give the United States
ammunition to sanction the country for currency manipulation. "That is
not retaliation. That is escalation of the trade war," said Gary
Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics. The Chinese currency has weakened over 3
percent since July 2018, when U.S. authorities began collecting the
first China-specific tariffs. That has absorbed some of the impact of
tariffs on Chinese exporters. HARASSING U.S. COMPANIES OR SLOWING VISA
APPROVALS China's Commerce Ministry has said it would draft a list of
foreign companies, organizations and individuals that it deems
"unreliable" for harming Chinese companies. The list would apply to
companies that flout market rules and the spirit of contracts, block
supplies to Chinese companies for noncommercial reasons or otherwise
harm the interests of Chinese companies. China could target high-profile
U.S. companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), although that could backfire
as millions of Chinese people depend on the tech firm for their jobs.
Goldman Sachs has estimated that banning Apple products could slash
profits of the iPhone maker by almost a third. Apple and other U.S.
firms are also vulnerable to consumer boycotts in China. There is
precedent for this: South Korean companies faced boycotts when
deployment of a U.S. antimissile system angered China's government.
Beijing could make life difficult for American banks, restaurant chains
such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), courier companies such as FedEx Corp
(FDX.N) and commodity suppliers by opening tax inquiries, withholding
licenses and other similar bureaucratic moves. Big U.S. businesses,
however, have been among those pushing for a more moderate stance in
Washington, so it would not help Beijing's case to alienate them. Many
American brands in China have joint ventures with Chinese partners, and
these would also be hurt by government pressure. Both sides have already
slowed visa approvals for academics; authorities could do the same for
executives and government officials. DIPLOMATIC RECALCITRANCE AND
MILITARY POSTURING **[Beijing could reduce cooperation with the United
States on thorny international issues, such as North Korea and Iran. It
could also step up military gestures in the South China Sea and around
Taiwan, an unofficial U.S. ally]{.underline}**. HIGHER TARIFFS The
United States could increase tariffs on Chinese imports. Authority for
that rests with Trump, who has described himself as "Tariff Man."
Trump's administration is preparing tariffs on a remaining \$300 billion
in Chinese imports that have so far been spared. A public comment period
ends on July 2, meaning Trump could impose tariffs on the goods, which
include some \$167 billion worth of consumer technology products, days
after his meeting with Xi. Beyond that, one option would be to raise
levies further on \$50 billion worth of Chinese technology goods,
including machinery, semiconductors, autos, aircraft parts and
intermediate electronic components on which tariffs were imposed last
July and August. The products, taxed at a 25% rate, were selected to
avoid hitting U.S. consumers and to hamper China's technology
development. SANCTIONS AGAINST SPECIFIC COMPANIES The United States
could sanction additional Chinese companies flagged for a host of
issues, from alleged intellectual property theft to sanctions violations
or human rights concerns. One option would be placing more companies on
a blacklist that bars U.S. suppliers from selling to them without
special approval, as the Trump administration did with Huawei
Technologies in May. It followed suit this month by adding several
Chinese companies and a government-owned institute to the list over
concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are
developing. Washington is already considering sanctions for Chinese
video surveillance firm Hikvision and equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua
Technology (002236.SZ). They are involved in surveillance at Chinese
detention centers for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims. The downside
would be hurting U.S. companies that do business with the targeted firm.
Administration officials could further increase pressure on foreign
governments to exclude Huawei from their 5G wireless networks. JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT CRACKDOWN The Justice Department is likely to continue to
crack down on Chinese spies and hackers for stealing technology and
trade secrets from American corporations, as part of its China
initiative to counter Chinese economic and security threats. FOREIGN
POLICY AND DEFENSE LEVERS? **[Tension has already risen as the United
States undertakes freedom of navigation operations through the Taiwan
Strait and South China Sea. China has been increasingly assertive about
its sovereignty over Taiwan, which it considers Chinese territory to be
brought under Beijing's control by force if needed. U.S. warships have
sailed through the Taiwan Strait at least once a month since the start
of this year.]{.underline}** The United States restarted such missions
on a regular basis last July.

School Nonresident Senior Fellow - Brookings Institution

Unfortunately that's unlikely because **[the crisis in U.S.-China
relations now exists in virtually every part of the relationship. Even
more troubling and dangerous, there is a growing sense in each country's
government that the other is a pervasive adversary]{.underline}**. Here
are just a few areas of conflict: Trade war: The current trade war is
having large negative consequences in both countries---with huge tariffs
in place, more tariffs promised, and collapsed negotiations that have
become so publicly politicized in both countries that a deal will be
very difficult to achieve. Tech rivalry: The U.S. and China have
escalated their tech rivalry, each believing that hi-tech will determine
who dominates the future global economy and military power. The Chinese
leadership believes that U.S. actions like placing Huawei on the "Entity
List" (banning it from buying components from U.S. companies without
U.S. government approval) reveals a U.S. goal to gravely wound China's
economy. Many in the U.S. government favor "decoupling" our two
economies to protect us, in spite of radical effects this would have.
Taiwan escalations: **[Taiwan, the single most sensitive and militarily
dangerous issue in the U.S.-China relationship for more than 50 years,
is newly fraught on both sides. In a striking departure from the "One
China" principle, a Department of Defense report recently referred to
Taiwan in a category of "countries." Senior Chinese officials,
meanwhile, have spoken in seemingly stronger tones about "reuniting" the
mainland and Taiwan, "reserving the option of taking all necessary
measures."]{.underline}** Asia-Pacific militarization: China's growing
military power---and its occupation, reclamation and militarization of
various South China Sea land features (in violation of international law
as determined by a UN arbitration tribunal)---have produced intensified
U.S. patrols and freedom of navigation operations, creating real risks
of military conflict, with weakened crisis management procedures making
escalations from accidents and individual incidents much more likely.
Ideological clashes: Open ideological shouting matches have increased.
On the U.S. side, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan recently
described the U.S.-China relationship as a "geopolitical rivalry between
free and repressive world order visions," and a senior State Department
official recently called it a "clash of civilizations." China's
authoritarian leaders have not only more bluntly criticized the
inequalities and disarray of U.S. democracy and U.S. "bullying," but
domestically have more firmly imposed CCP political control, slowed down
liberalizing economic reforms, and more branzenly committed human rights
abuses, most disturbingly with the massive detentions in Xinjiang to
"re-educate" the Uighur population. Visa wars: Each country is
undermining the stabilizing power of people-to-people exchanges by
denying visas to people from the other country. One rationale on the
U.S. side was stated by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who calls China's
espionage and influence activity a "whole of society" effort, making
every potential Chinese visitor a person of suspicion. China's
intimidation of foreigners, including its shocking ongoing detention of
several Canadian travelers, is on the increase. International system
conflict: **[In different ways, both China under Xi and the U.S. under
Trump are challenging the international system that has generally
provided remarkable global stability over the last 70 years, and
challenging each other's role in the system. The system is rapidly
weakening, with no significant efforts underway to adjust and strengthen
it.]{.underline}** These are just some specific examples. The deeper
problem is a more fundamental change in each government's perception of
the other. U.S. government officials are now openly calling China an
adversary, seeking to undermine and displace U.S. power and global
leadership. China's leaders have publicly used more moderate language
but clearly have concluded that, at least under the Trump
administration, the U.S. is China's enemy and is seeking to weaken China
and to bring about regime change of Chinese Communist Party rule.
Perceptions are becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, as each country is
taking actions that reflect its perceptions of the other's hostile
intentions, and these reactions themselves reinforce the other country's
sense of enmity. Fundamental attitudinal shifts will get even worse if
the relationship is not stabilized. Global dynamics will change. China
will continue moving closer to Russia ---an inherently unstable but
dangerous coalition, especially as our ties with our own allies are
weakening. Other countries caught up in this escalating rivalry but not
wanting to take sides can easily stumble. **[This terrible downward
spiral must be stopped. But can it be?]{.underline}** Of course it can.
Government policies and actions are made by human beings. Structural
forces affect history, but human agency---not "destiny"---determines
history's outcomes. Whether human beings with power will in fact make
appropriate choices or blunder disastrously is a separate question.
Despite the rhetoric of systemic forces and historical trends common on
both sides, we must focus on the fact that human beings in the United
States and China will shape the future of the U.S.-China relationship,
and neither country is synonymous with its leader or even with its
government. There is debate and fluidity in both countries about the
relationship.

The key dispute between the PRC and Taiwan concerns Taiwan's sovereign
status. [The PRC claims sovereignty over Taiwan]{.underline} and rejects
the notion that the Republic of China (ROC) government on Taiwan
represents an independent, sovereign state. For Beijing formal
unification with the island remains an important national objective.
Thus [any effort on Taiwan that tries to weaken the political and
historical link between Taiwan and mainland China provokes opposition in
Beijing]{.underline}; [the PRC]{.underline} refuses to renounce the use
of force against Taiwan and [has vowed to fight a war to prevent
Taiwan's formal separation from China]{.underline}. Taiwan's position on
the sovereignty issue, meanwhile, has evolved considerably over time.
For several decades following the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan, the ROC
government continued to view itself as the legitimate government of all
of China; the PRC, in turn, was a "bandit" regime that lacked
legitimacy. As Taiwan democratized in the 1980s and 1990s, however, its
government began to distance itself from the notion that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait were parts of "one China." Under President Lee
Teng-hui's "pragmatic diplomacy," Taiwan sought greater participation in
international society as a political entity separated from PRC. Lee
floated concepts such as "one China, two political entities," and in
1999 described the cross-Strait relationship as "state-to-state, or at
least special state-to-state relations." President Chen Shui-bian
(2000--2008) later took numerous symbolic steps to highlight Taiwan's
separateness from China. Chen often described Taiwan as an "independent,
sovereign country," and during his presidency he advocated a new
constitution more "suitable" to the needs of Taiwan than the ROC
constitution (which predated the Nationalist retreat to the island).
Cross-Strait relations were often tense during the Lee and Chen
presidencies, and [Beijing frequently warned that it was willing to use
force to prevent Taiwan from formalizing its independent
status.]{.underline}

[The United States should reorient its arms sales policy]{.underline} to
ensure that sales provide strategic benefits and to avoid producing
negative unintended consequences. **[At a practical level, this means
reducing arms sales dramatically]{.underline}**, especially to nations
with high risk factors for negative outcomes. [Officials should look for
other ways to conduct foreign policy]{.underline} in situations where
arms sales have been common tactics --- such as when the United States
negotiates access to military bases or seeks cooperation in the war on
terror. [The arms sales process should also be revised in order to
ensure that all sales receive more thorough scrutiny than has been the
case to date.]{.underline} To implement this new vision for arms sales
**[we recommend the following steps:]{.underline}** Issue an Updated
Presidential Policy Directive on Arms Sales --- Most importantly, the
president should issue a new Presidential Policy Directive reorienting
U.S. arms sales policy so that the new default policy is "no sale." [The
only circumstances in which the United States should sell or transfer
arms to another country are when three conditions are met: (1) there is
a direct threat to American national security; (2) there is no other way
to confront that threat other than arming another country; and (3) the
United States is the only potential supplier of the necessary
weapons]{.underline}. The reasoning behind this recommendation is
threefold: first, as noted, the United States enjoys such a high level
of strategic immunity that there is currently no direct security
rationale for arms sales to any nation. Second, [even if one believes
that the United States has an interest in helping other nations defend
themselves against internal enemies]{.underline} (e.g., Iraq,
Afghanistan) [or external ones]{.underline} (e.g., South Korea,
[Taiwan]{.underline}, NATO countries), [there are other ways the United
States can help instead of supplying weapons]{.underline}. Finally, [by
halting the sales of weapons the United States will decrease the risk of
entanglement in conflicts that do not directly involve American
security. It will also improve the diplomatic flexibility]{.underline}
of the United States to play the role of honest broker and to exert
moral leverage on dueling parties. [Immediately Stop Selling Weapons to
Risky Nations]{.underline} --- [The first step in implementing a new
approach should be to stop selling weapons to the countries most likely
to misuse weapons or to lose control of them]{.underline}. Based on the
risk assessment described here, [we recommend that the United States
immediately halt the sale of weapons to any nation that scored in the
"highest risk" category for any risk factor, or which is actively
engaged in conflict.]{.underline} Taking this action would immediately
add 71 nations to the list of embargoed nations until further notice.
This simple and commonsense step would mitigate some of the worst
negative consequences and stop the United States from enabling conflicts
abroad. Improve and Respond to End-Use Monitoring --- The United States
should significantly expand its tracking of the use and misuse of
American weapons. The current system of end-use monitoring does not
collect enough data on how weapons are used once they are transferred.
This is largely because the system is designed to monitor and prevent
instances of dispersion and corruption and is not necessarily focused on
the use of force by the client military and government. Rather than
focusing on tracking abuse down to a single military unit, end-use
monitoring should hold countries accountable for the actions of their
militaries as a whole. End-use monitoring should take into account the
bigger picture of a country's strategic environment and should assess
weapons sales based on a proposed customer's history, actions, and
participation in ongoing conflicts. End-use monitoring should be tracked
and reported annually, and the results should be made public to enforce
oversight and give Congress the information needed to make
better-informed decisions. [Amend the AECA to Require Congressional
Approval for All Arms Sales]{.underline} --- Finally, [we recommend that
the AECA be amended to require congressional approval]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} all arms [sales]{.underline}. [The current law is
designed to make arms sales easy by making it difficult for Congress to
block them. Blocking a sale requires a majority vote in both houses of
Congress, with such votes typically cropping up inconveniently in the
middle of other, more-pressing issues on the legislative
agenda.]{.underline} Congress has exerted little or no influence over
arms sales and has allowed the executive branch near-complete autonomy.
Requiring a congressional vote to approve arms sales, on the other hand,
would subject arms deals to much more intense scrutiny than has
traditionally been the case, and blocking misguided arms sales would be
much easier. [Requiring a separate piece of legislation to approve each
arms deal, not simply requiring a resolution against, would encourage
deliberations about the strategic benefits of any proposed
deal.]{.underline} Conclusion [Selling major conventional weapons is a
risky business, especially to nations where conditions are ripe for bad
outcomes]{.underline}. [After decades of selling weapons to almost any
nation that asks, enough evidence has accumulated to make it clear that
the costs outweigh the benefits. Policy change is long
overdue.]{.underline} Unfortunately, Donald Trump has embraced the
conventional wisdom. In addition to the massive \$110 billion deal with
Saudi Arabia, Trump has seized on the tensions with North Korea to
encourage Japan and other Asian allies to buy more American weapons. For
Trump, the rationale was simple: "It's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of
safety for Japan."101 As we have argued here, this [conventional wisdom
is misguided]{.underline}. [Instead of turning first to arms sales,
which are likely to inflame tensions in hot spots like the Pacific Rim
or the Middle East, the United States should rely more heavily on
diplomacy. The United States does not need the limited economic benefits
arms sales provide --- and it certainly does not need the strategic
headaches that come with them.]{.underline}

#### Ending arms sales jumpstarts Taiwan defense industry 

**Holmes 19** (James- J. C. Wylie Chair of Maritime Strategy at the
Naval War College , 4-7-2019, \"Explained: Why Taiwan Needs New
Submarines to Deter China,\" National
Interest, <https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/explained-why-taiwan-needs-new-submarines-deter-china-51227>)
HG

New submarines for Taiwan? Yes, please! [Submarine construction is
poised to become a reality now that Washington has lifted restrictions
that once prohibited exports of equipment to outfit or arm Taiwanese
boats. It appears indigenous builders will construct the hulls---eight
is the number bruited about---while foreign partners will supply the
sensors, combat systems, and weapons along with technical advice. A
vibrant undersea fleet would pay political and strategic dividends that
the current contingent of two aging and two positively elderly boats
could never yield]{.underline}. It only makes sense for Taiwan to take
charge of its own destiny. The gods of world affairs help those who help
themselves. **[Wise societies tend to their own security and interests
to the utmost extent possible rather than trust to foreign allies who
could prove untrustworthy in times of martial strife. Human nature helps
explain why self-help represents the bedrock underlying international
relations.]{.underline}** General George S. Patton, a keen observer of
the human condition, opined that people cheer likely victors while
scorning likely losers. And so they do. Who flocks to a losing cause?
Few. People either side with winners, or they side with outmatched
contenders who do their darnedest in their own cause---in other words,
with pugilists who could succumb yet command admiration and could
prevail with help. Report Advertisement Winston Churchill's Great
Britain showed pluck when it stood alone against the Axis in 1940-1941.
It was a worthy cause. [Submariners could be Taiwan's answer to Royal
Air Force pilots who dueled the Luftwaffe daily during the Battle of
Britain. Taiwan Navy (or Republic of China Navy, ROCN) boats could ward
off attacks on the homeland or strike offensively while inspiring allies
to rally to the cause.]{.underline} Military **[sage Carl von Clausewitz
explains allies' halfheartedness in terms of competing priorities. One
combatant may support another, and do so sincerely. But it never takes
its ally's cause as seriously as it takes its own.]{.underline}**
Tepidly committed, it devotes modest diplomatic, economic, and military
resources to common endeavors; it writes off an endeavor when costs and
dangers mount. Report Advertisement When the going gets tough, confides
Clausewitz, less-than-tough allies get going---toward the exit[.
Inhabitants of Taiwan understand this phenomenon better than most. The
prospect of abandonment stares islanders in the face every day as China
deploys diplomatic, economic, and military inducements or coercion to
discourage outsiders from coming to the island's defense. Which is why
Taipei must seize ownership of its defense against Big Brother across
the Taiwan Strait. At sea that means shifting from a "sea-control" to a
"sea-denial" strategy. Sea control is a strategy of the strong. A navy
intent on sea control strives to sweep the antagonist from important
waters and make them a preserve from which to control the sea lanes or
project power ashore.]{.underline} Once upon a time the Taiwan Navy
aspired to rule the waves, and it stood a reasonable chance of doing so.
Material and human excellence made it a legitimate contender against the
large but backward People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy), its
archnemesis. Those days have receded into memory as China's military
mass-produces high-tech fighting ships and planes, takes to the sea and
sky, and backs its battle fleet with shore-based firepower. In short,
[Taiwan's navy no longer commands nearby waters and stands little chance
of regaining maritime supremacy. That doesn't mean all is lost. To
protect their island ROCN mariners mainly need to deny the PLA Navy
control of waters adjacent to Taiwan, not dominate those waters for
themselves. If they can fend off amphibious assault, break blockades,
and assail shipping, they can grant allies---chiefly the United
States---time to fight their way into the theater and reverse Chinese
aggression. Sea denial is a time-honored strategy of the lesser
contender. Handled deftly and imaginatively, swarms of inexpensive yet
super empowered small craft can give a hostile fleet a very bad
day.]{.underline} As historian Theodore Ropp observed of the fin de
siècle French Navy, David need not defeat Goliath---the Goliath of those
days being Great Britain's Royal Navy---to curtail the giant's freedom
of movement near shore. If anything Ropp's logic of sea denial is even
more compelling today than it was during that age of rudimentary
steamships, diesel submarines, and torpedoes. Today diesel submarines
fitted with "air-independent propulsion" can vanish into the depths for
long stretches to elude detection. Fast patrol craft can mingle with
surface traffic or lurk along congested shorelines for concealment.
Report Advertisement Sea-denial platforms riding the waves or prowling
beneath can launch torpedo attacks or loft anti-ship missiles against
oncoming aggressors---and they can cruise in company with unmanned
aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles of all types. Their attacks
would be hard for PLA Navy shipping to counter in the cramped quarters
of the Taiwan Strait, where engagements happen at short range and
defenders have scant time to react. David has options. Report
Advertisement Even a single boat can throw an opponent's strategy askew
in modern naval warfare, as both the Argentine and British navies
learned during the Falklands War of 1982. A Royal Navy nuclear-powered
attack sub sank the cruiser General Belgrano, pride of the Argentine
Navy. But the Royal Navy task force expended virtually Britain's entire
war stock of anti-submarine munitions in a futile effort to sink an
Argentine diesel boat stalking the fleet. One imagines the Taiwan Navy
would easily outperform the Argentine Navy---especially if it were a
beneficiary of U.S. and allied hardware, methods, and counsel. The
prospect of effective ROCN subsurface operations could distort PLA Navy
operating patterns to Taiwan's benefit. In the ideal case it could deter
entry into the island's near seas altogether. Report Advertisement
Mass---numbers of vessels---appears adequate unto Taipei's purposes.
T[he inventory will presumably stabilize at eight boats once new craft
are built and decrepit ones retire. Factor in training, upkeep, and deep
maintenance, and three or four should be underway or ready to put to sea
for combat duty at any given moment. These are strategic assets. Naval
commanders should keep boats on patrol at all times, honing crews'
tactical proficiency while guarding against a preemptive strike on the
sub force at its moorings. Beyond that, how can the Taiwan Navy maximize
its potential for sea denial? Sea denial is strategically defensive in
outlook, but that doesn't rule out offensive tactics. In fact, offense
is the beating heart of strategic defense according to the masters of
maritime strategy]{.underline}. Sure, ROCN subs could take a passive
stance, in effect standing sentry duty off seaports such as Kaohsiung or
beaches likely to be targeted during a cross-strait amphibious assault.
[They could await attack and strike back hard. This would be valuable
service. Report Advertisement Better yet, skippers could take an
offensively minded, enterprising stance. Taiwan Navy boats could lurk
off mainland seaports to raid shipping as it enters or leaves harbor. Or
they could loiter in or around straits that pierce the first island
chain. Barring the Luzon Strait---PLA Navy boats' favorite passageway
between the Western Pacific and South China Sea---would constitute an
immense contribution. The wide Miyako Strait, to Taiwan's north, could
offer rich hunting grounds as well. Corralling Chinese quarry within the
island chain would help Taipei safeguard the island's east
coast.]{.underline} And it would let the Taiwanese armed forces shore up
the central segment of the "Great Wall in reverse" the U.S. armed forces
seem intent on erecting along the island chain, in concert with allies,
to constrain PLA maritime movement. Report Advertisement Here's where
the political dividends come in. Not only would ROCN efforts advance
Taiwan's strategic fortunes, they would advance allied strategy as a
whole. In turn they would generate a powerful incentive for allies such
as the U.S. Navy and Japan Self-Defense Forces to bear a hand in
Taiwan's defense. Reciprocity---not just vague pledges to render
assistance---would unite the allies behind a common cause. Taipei would
help others by helping itself, and self-interest would prompt others to
help Taipei. Report Advertisement A virtuous cycle would have been set
in motion. So by all means let indigenous shipyards construct the hulls,
and let foreign partners supply such help as shipwrights and submariners
need. The more boats take to the sea and the faster they get there, the
better. In the meantime, it's never too early to start holding quiet
discussions among the silent services about common tactics, training,
methods for waterspace management, and on and on. Put the human factor
in order now and you reduce the problem of bolstering Taiwan's undersea
prowess to a matter of acquiring new widgets. Let's refine the art and
science of multinational combat beneath the sea. And let's start
forthwith.

#### stopping u.s arms to taiwan solves for military confrontation from china

**McClaran,** (John P. "U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan: Implications for the
Future of the Sino-U.S. Relationship." *Asian Survey*, vol. 40, no. 4,
**2000**, pp. 622--640. *JSTOR*,

Answering the question of what policy solutions can mitigate the
problems caused by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan is complex. The issue is
not just one of differing political interpretations between the 1982
U.S.-PRC Joint Communique and the TRA. These two documents are at
loggerheads where fundamental foreign policy differences between the
U.S. and China collide. U.S. efforts to exert its global and regional
influence [exacerbate long-held Chinese suspicions of U.S. aspirations
to hegemony]{.underline}. In turn, [China\'s drive to modernize its
military along with Beijing\'s domestic and international behavior
exacerbate equally long-held suspicions of China in the
U.S.]{.underline} This has left **[Taiwan as the destination of U.S.
arms to satisfy a vast array of Congressional issues and
interests]{.underline}** that in **[turn feed China\'s growing
nationalist ire,]{.underline}** which [threatens the broader goals of
U.S.-PRC relations]{.underline}. Whether they may ease the growing
dilemma of legitimacy for the Communist leadership is an open question,
but [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan significantly reduce Beijing\'s
options]{.underline} in dealing with Taipei and greatly **[increase the
prospects of military confrontation.]{.underline}** The **[net
effect]{.underline}** is that these **[arms sales]{.underline}** have
become the **[single biggest obstacle]{.underline}** to
**[establishing]{.underline}** fully **[normal relations between the
U.S. and China]{.underline}** and [narrow the options for both sides to
either conflict or cooperate]{.underline}. The U.S. in essence has
painted itself into a corner because it has failed to honor the
commitments it has made to China in the past. The truth is not a
currency easily converted by changed circumstances. The fundamental
truth is that the **[U.S. promised China]{.underline}** that it would
**[show great restraint]{.underline}** in [providing
**limited**]{.underline} and **[defensive arms]{.underline}** to
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** during an ill-defined transition era that was
to follow the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. The [U.S.
promised]{.underline} that during this transition it would
[shift]{.underline} its emphasis away from [supplying arms to
Taiwan]{.underline} and toward [promoting]{.underline} the necessary
[dialogue]{.underline} and This content downloaded from negotiation that
would help reconcile China and Taiwan. Doing such would allow these two
entities to find a formula to live together in peace and create a
transitional era in which the U.S. and China could then solve the
problems left over from history while allowing their own relationship to
move forward. Both Washington and Beijing had a great deal to gain from
one another in 1979 and this remains the case today. **[Arms
sales,]{.underline}** however, are the **[major problem]{.underline}**
left over from history that **[prevents]{.underline}** the
**[relationship from developing as both governments would
wish]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan does not need more arms from the
U.S]{.underline}**. What it does need is help in both assimilating the
diverse and sophisticated array of equipment it now has and reducing the
influence of non-war fighting factors that seriously impinge the
development of a modern force capable of executing its national military
strategy. [To help Taiwan achieve these]{.underline} **[objectives, the
U.S. must shift from supplying arms]{.underline}** overtly to a discreet
strategy of advice and assistance designed to improve and rationalize
Taiwan\'s force structure with its military objectives. This must be
done in a way that would not violate the spirit of the TRA or give China
the impression that Taiwan and the U.S. were developing a joint war
fighting capability. Fundamentally, the only real measure that will
ensure that Taiwan\'s democracy and free market are never threatened by
China is for there to be not a change in Taiwan\'s rhetoric about China
but rather for China to become different by evolving into a more
democratic, pluralist country that will not seek unity by force. Taiwan
would find such a country a more attractive partner. What will make
Taiwan diplomatically recognizable is a change in China; such change is
already in progress and Taiwan and the U.S. can play a huge role in
influencing the outcome. The only thing that Taiwan needs is time, and
the key to buying time is not clarity but ambiguity. **[U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}** to **[Taiwan]{.underline}** and the strengthening
of their military relations when coupled with declarations of
independence **[force]{.underline}** clarity in Taiwan\'s relations with
China and hence **[limit]{.underline}** **[the options for all
sides]{.underline}**. Ambiguity is what in a sense bought time for
Taiwan to make itself unignorably, and more ambiguity is what will buy
it the time to make itself fully recognizable by allowing events in
China to run their course. Reconciling the differences between the 1982
Joint Communique and the TRA may not be the answer but restoring a
balance between the two is. Indeed, ambiguity and discretion may prove
to have been the wisdom inherent in the framework of these documents by
providing a flexible fulcrum upon which the U.S. can balance a difficult
and complex issue. Thus, the formula exists for a peaceful resolution to
this dispute; however, the [U.S. needs to find the leadership and
courage of conviction to honor its commitments in this
regard.]{.underline}

### Relations 

#### end those arms sales!

**Zarong 13** (Wu Zarong- research fellow at the China Foundation for
International Studies, 4-2-13, \"Is it Time to Stop Arms Sales to
Taiwan?,\"

RK

Since ancient times, Taiwan has been the territory of China. Oddly
enough, **[Taiwan has always been an obstacle to the stable development
of Sino-US relations since the birth]{.underline}** of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) in October of 1949. The peaceful development of
relations across the Taiwan Straits since 2008 is helping remove this
obstacle. It is high time now for the US to seize the opportunity and
make up its mind to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop
arms sales to Taiwan and stop overt and covert official contact with
Taiwan. For the last 34 years, **[US arms sales to Taiwan have caused
considerable troubles between China and the US, making relations
stagnate and suffer setbacks.]{.underline}** **[Neither China nor the US
strategically benefits from this unstable relationship.]{.underline}**
The Taiwan issue is a remnant of history. **[For the last 60 years or
more, it has been the single most important and most sensitive issue at
the heart of Sino-US relations.]{.underline}** In a certain sense,
**[the failure to seriously discuss and resolve this issue has
contributed to the 22 years of estrangement and hostility experienced
between China and the US]{.underline}**. When President Nixon made his
historic visit to China in 1972, Taiwan had been a central issue in the
negotiations for normalization of relations between China and the United
States. On January 1, 1979, China and the US established full diplomatic
relations when the Carter Administration decided to sever diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, withdraw American troops and military
installations from Taiwan, and to abrogate the treaties it had signed
with Taiwan. In a word, resolution of the Taiwan issue was key to
normalization. On April 10, 1979, President Carter signed the **[Taiwan
Relations Act]{.underline}** into law. The law directs the Executive
Branch to promptly inform Congress of any threat to Taiwan's security or
to the social or economic system of the Taiwanese people, including any
danger to the interests of the US. The act **[states that the US will
make available defense articles and services in such a quantity as may
be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability. The Chinese Government resolutely opposed the law, stating
that the law contravenes the principles agreed upon by the two sides and
constitutes gross interference in China's internal
affairs]{.underline}**. Thus, **[the Taiwan issue remains a key issue
obstructing the healthy development of Sino-US relations after
normalization.]{.underline}** Given the weight the Taiwan issue carries
for Sino-US relations, China and the US should urgently act to resolve
the Taiwan issue and ensure long-term stability of bilateral relations.
**[Now]{.underline}**, with peaceful development established in
cross-Straits relations, **[assumed threats to Taiwan are diminishing
and there is no apparent danger to US interests]{.underline}**.
Therefore, the Taiwan Relations Act is now completely out of date.
**[The US has expressed support for the continued expansion of exchanges
and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits as it is not
only in the interests of the people of both sides of the Straits, but
also helps maintain peace and stability in the region.]{.underline}**
With the establishment of peace prevailing across the Taiwan Straits**[,
US arms sales to Taiwan have not only become unreasonable but also
unnecessary]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan's needs for weapons are on the
decline. The arms sold to Taiwan are used to protect Taiwan's fishing
boats in the Diaoyu Islands' territorial waters]{.underline}**. **[It
would be ridiculous if the US insists on arms sales to Taiwan when the
US officially insists on the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
issue]{.underline}**. Under the current situation, **[the US decision to
completely terminate arms sales to Taiwan would be a wise
choice.]{.underline}** As China and the US work together to build a new
type of major power relationship, based on equality and mutual benefit,
continued interference in China's internal affairs is not helpful at
all. Since sustainable peace across the Taiwan Straits has overturned
the very foundation of the Taiwan Relations Act, **[the US is losing its
standing to continue arms sales to Taiwan.]{.underline}** For the past
34 years, **[the US has violated the basic principles]{.underline}**
enshrined in the three joint communiqués between China and the US **[by
selling arms to Taiwan, which has already inflicted severe damage upon
Sino-US relations. It is high time for such violations to come to an
end, benefitting both China and the United States.]{.underline}**
**[Stopping interference in China's internal affairs by terminating US
arms sales to and official contact with Taiwan does not mean the US is
"giving up Taiwan." It only means that the US has come to truly abide by
the principles and the spirit of the three joint
communiqués]{.underline}**, greatly **[helping to enhance US credibility
and strengthen mutual political trust between China and the US. At the
same time, it is believed that nonofficial contact and exchanges by the
US with Taiwan, whether cultural, economic or business, will continue to
flourish on a solid basis in the peaceful environment across the Taiwan
Straits]{.underline}**. 

#### Ending arms sales does undermine Taiwan's ability to defend itself-Plan is symbolic 

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall- senior fellow for the
Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department and Caroline

[The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic
flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue that even if
arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a
potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, [the
diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh the potential
leverage or other benefits from arms sales]{.underline}. Most
importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, the
United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all
parties as an honest broker. The inherent difficulty of negotiating
while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North and South
Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North Korea
clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts to
help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians have
long been complicated by American support for Israel. To [stop arming
one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the United
States does not have a preferred outcome in such case]{.underline}s.
[Rather]{.underline}, [by staying out of the military domain the United
States can more readily encourage dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}.
[Forgoing]{.underline} [arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy
even in cases where the United States has an entrenched
interest]{.underline}. [In the case of Taiwan]{.underline}, for example,
[though]{.underline} it is clear that [Taiwan needs to purchase
weapons]{.underline} from other countries to provide for its defense,
**[those weapons do not have to be made in the United States. Having
Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China
tensions.]{.underline}** [**Even if Taiwan's defenses remained robust,
China would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer
signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf.**
This]{.underline} [could]{.underline} also [promote]{.underline} more
productive [U.S.-China diplomacy]{.underline} in general, [as well as
greater stability in the Pacific region]{.underline}. Most important,
**[breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of the
United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and
China.]{.underline}**

In regard to Taiwan abandonment, there are two groups of people. The
first group [argues that the United States should get out of Taiwan
affairs]{.underline}. For people in favor of this perspective, because
of the narrowing gap between the United States and China economically
and militarily and the expanding gap between the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan in both Does Taiwan Matter to the United States? 185 spheres,
**[Taiwan should not remain as an unstable root of tensions between
Washington and Beijing]{.underline}**. If the **[United States continues
to support Taiwan in the last stage of the Chinese civil war, it will
face a series of negative implications]{.underline}**. As David
Shambaugh has argued, the **[game between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is over.]{.underline}** Since Taiwan cannot escape from the
mainland's control, **[Washington should abandon Taiwan as early as
possible]{.underline}** 23 Chas Freeman argues that the **[long
friendship and cooperation between the United States and the Chinese
mainland are far more important than Americans' special sentiments to
Taiwan; the best policy therefore is to accept China's
reunification]{.underline}**.24 Former U.S. ambassador to China Joseph
Prueher argues that **[even if America continues to provide arms sales
to Taiwan, the island cannot defend itself.]{.underline}** Charles
Glaser considers Taiwan as a strategic liability of the United States.
**[Because Taiwan's leader may bring America into a war with China,
which has developed its regular and strategic nuclear forces quickly,
Washington should gradually free itself from Taiwan affairs to avoid
falling into a longtime hostility with a rising China 25]{.underline}**
Like Owens, both Prueher and Glaser agree that the United States should
review the TRA and the arms sales issues.26 According to Bruce Gilley,
if Taiwan can maintain autonomy and democracy, getting rid of its role
as a strategic partner of the United States through Finalization, it
will be good news for the American government who is increasingly
seeking China's cooperation; Washington does not need to include Taiwan
into its strategic orbit 27 More bluntly, Paul Kane even suggests the
Obama administration negotiate with the Chinese government behind doors
to cancel American debt of \$1.14 trillion to China by ending arms sales
and military assistance to Taiwan 28 **[From a realist
perspective,]{.underline}** John **[Mearsheimer argues that if China
continues to grow dramatically, Taiwan seems doomed to become part of
China, and the United States has to say goodbye to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. For Mearsheimer, "**[at some point in the next
decade or so, it will become impossible for the United States to help
Taiwan defend itself against a Chinese attack."]{.underline}** The price
of close relations between the United States and Taiwan will overtake
the interest America can gain. It is doubtful how long Washington will
consider Taiwan as a strategic asset.29 For him, **[Taiwan abandonment
is undesirable, but it may eventually become a reality that the United
States has to accept.]{.underline}** As Michael Swaine argues, as **[the
United States cannot maintain dominance]{.underline}** in East Asia
**[and commitment to Taiwan's security]{.underline}** in the long run,
it should soon begin to consider negotiation with the Chinese mainland,
reducing both parties' 186 Gang Lin and Wenxing Zhou military projection
in the Taiwan Strait and revising the Six Assurances so that the two
sides of the strait can eventually move to political dialogue.30

slap that Beijing's claim to seek peaceful development was "a lie of the
ages." Lest anyone not fully grasp the extent of Taipei's hostility
toward the PRC, the statement went on: "We need to remind the public
that the Chinese Communist Party is practicing anti-democracy,
anti-peace between the two sides of the strait and further resorting to
war. This is the main cause of the tension in the Taiwan Strait and the
region, and it is the source of danger and provocation against peace and
stability." **[The vitriolic exchange constituted a worrisome escalation
of the animosity between Taipei and Beijing that has been roiling for
the past three years. The victory of]{.underline}** **[the
pro-independence]{.underline}** Democratic Progressive Party
(**[DPP]{.underline}**) in Taiwan's 2016 elections **[dashed any
hopes]{.underline}** Chinese leaders had that the burgeoning economic
ties with the mainland would translate gradually into increased
Taiwanese popular support **[for political reunification]{.underline}**.
Anger at that strategy's failure led Beijing to revive a campaign to
increase Taiwan's diplomatic isolation by poaching the few small nations
that still maintain formal relations with Taipei. The PRC's menacing
military activities also increased. Chinese war games in and around the
Taiwan Strait have soared since 2016. The U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency's 2019 report to Congress also concludes that Beijing is building
up its ground, air, and naval forces to achieve a more robust capability
to invade Taiwan. **[Anger at Beijing's treatment of Taiwan has led to
congressional and executive branch measures to strengthen Washington's
backing for Taipei.]{.underline}** A major step occurred in March 2018
when President Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), which
encouraged high-level U.S. officials to meet with their Taiwan
counterparts. That legislation, which passed both houses of Congress,
ended Washington's cautious practice under the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) of holding meetings only with relatively low-level Taiwanese
officials. It was especially noticeable that the TTA specifically
promoted interaction by "cabinet-level national security officials."
That provision proved to be more than a symbolic gesture when National
Security Adviser John Bolton met with Taiwan National Security Council
Secretary-General David Lee in May**[. Bolton's intention to push for
stronger security ties between the United States and Taiwan cannot be
overstated. Before his current stint in government service, he pushed
for highly dangerous and provocative policies. He urged the United
States to establish formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and even
advocated moving U.S. military forces from Okinawa to Taiwan. Either
measure would cross a bright red line as far as Beijing is concerned and
would likely trigger PRC military action to prevent Taiwan's permanent
political separation from the mainland. Having someone with those views
holding a crucial policy post and sitting just a few doors down from the
Oval Office greatly increases the likelihood of a further boost in U.S.
support for Taiwan, despite the risk of war with China. There
are]{.underline}** multiple **[sign]{.underline}**s from various sources
**[of growing U.S. backing for Taiwan's]{.underline}** de facto
**[independence.]{.underline}** **[Congress certainly is stepping up its

**[The legislation also recommends that Washington continue "regular
sales of defense articles" to Taiwan]{.underline}** and back Taipei's
participation in international organizations---something Beijing
emphatically resists. The Trump administration doesn't seem to need much
prodding. U.S. warships have transited the Taiwan Strait on several
occasions over the past year to demonstrate military support for Taipei.
At the Shangri-La Dialogue session, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick
Shanahan stated that the United States would no longer "tiptoe around"
destabilizing Chinese behavior regarding Taiwan or the South China Sea.
**[While Americans are focused on the ongoing trade war between the

Taiwan lashed out at the Chinese defense minister\'s renewed threat to
use force to assert China\'s claim to the island, accusing Beijing of
creating unease in the region and seeking to \"expand its hegemony.\" A
statement from the Cabinet\'s Mainland Affairs Council targeted comments
Defense Minister Wei Fenghe made in Singapore on Sunday in which he said
China would \"resolutely take action\" to defend its claim to Taiwan and
the South China Sea. The council asserted later Sunday that Taiwan has
never been a part of the People\'s Republic of China and would never
accept Beijing\'s threats. It accused China of \"challenging
international norms and order\" and said Beijing\'s claim to seek
peaceful development had been recognized internationally as \"a lie of
the ages.\" \"**[We need to remind the public that the Chinese Communist
Party is practicing anti-democracy, anti-peace between the two sides of

**[main cause of the tension in the Taiwan Strait and the

against peace and stability,\" the statement said. It said **[Taiwan,
which is heavily dependent on U.S. arms for its defense, would continue
to strengthen its armed forces]{.underline}**, \"defend its national
sovereignty and democratic system,\" and uphold the right of the
island\'s 23 million people to \"freely choose their own future.\" The
sides split amid civil war in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek moved his
Nationalist government to Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover of the
mainland. Taiwan had been a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945. **[China
considers annexation of Taiwan to be an inevitability]{.underline}**,
and in his speech, Wei said Beijing was prepared to fight any opponent
to make that happen. \"China must be and will be reunified. We find no
excuse not to do so. **[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the
Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs, at all costs,
for national unity]{.underline}**,\" Wei said. China has boosted such
muscle flexing since the 2016 election of independence-leaning Taiwanese
President Tsai Ing-wen, who has infuriated Beijing by refusing to
endorse its contention that Taiwan is a part of China. Surveys show
solid majorities of Taiwanese favor maintaining the current state of
de-facto independence and reject China\'s call for unification with
Beijing under the \"one country, two systems\" framework now applied to
Hong Kong. **[China has also upped diplomatic pressure by poaching
several of the island\'s dwindling number of allies and barring
Taiwan\'s representatives from international gatherings, no matter how
non-political in nature. It has also discouraged Chinese tourists from
visiting the island and sought to win over Taiwanese investors by
offering them many of the same terms and conditions offered to native
Chinese.]{.underline}**

An informal notification of the proposed sale has been sent to the U.S.
Congress, the four sources said on condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to speak about the possible deal. The potential sale
included 108 General Dynamics Corp M1A2 Abrams tanks worth around \$2

sources said. **[Taiwan has been interested in refreshing its existing

Ing-wen said in March Washington was responding positively to Taipei's
requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of
pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan
but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend
itself.]{.underline} China and the United States are engaged in a fierce
trade war[, with clashes over Taiwan and the South China Sea
exacerbating tensions.]{.underline} [A spokesman for the State
Department, which oversees foreign military sales,]{.underline}** said
the U.S. government does not comment on or confirm potential or pending
arms sales or transfers before they have been formally notified to
Congress. The congressional notifications included a variety of
anti-tank munitions, including 409 Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin
Corp-made Javelin missiles worth as much as \$129 million, two of the
sources said. The notifications also included 1,240 TOW anti-tank
missiles worth as much as \$299 million, one of the sources said. There
were also 250 stinger missiles worth as much as \$223 million in the
notification, the source said. Stingers are often used in portable
anti-aircraft weapons systems. Taiwan's Defense Ministry confirmed it
had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding
normally. **[The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to
defend itself helps Taiwan's military to raise its combat abilities,

plant a month, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said during an April

month by the end of this year," partly because of international orders.
The Pentagon announced last week it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made

Philippines and Vietnam for \$47 million. The drones would afford
greater intelligence-gathering capabilities, potentially curbing Chinese

told the meeting that the United States would no longer "tiptoe" around
China's behavior in Asia. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, responding to the
Reuters report of planned the new arms sale, said Wei's "threatening"
comments and recent Chinese military drills near Taiwan showed the
importance of its need to strengthen its defensive abilities. "Going
forward our government will continue to deepen the close security
partnership between Taiwan and the United States," it said.

been a **[source of tension in the US-China relationship]{.underline}**.
The People's Republic of China (**[PRC]{.underline}**) found it

reduce gradually its sale of arms to Taiwan" and promised that future
arms sales to Taiwan "would not exceed, either in qualitative or
quantitative terms," those of recent years, but the record of US arms
sales since suggests that the communiqué has had little constraining
effect on US behavior. US arms sales to Taiwan, in turn, often

indignant" after an arms sale announcement, calling the sale a "gross
intervention in China's internal affairs" that would have a "serious
negative impact" on bilateral relations

control despite 70 years of divided rule. China has directed its
industrial strength toward huge investments in military hardware over
the past two decades, building a world-class navy and filling its
coastline with missiles capable of hitting Taiwanese targets. The

foreign ministry Sunday reported on one such incident, accusing China of
provocation. The ministry said two Chinese fighter jets crossed the
median line of the Taiwan Strait that divides the sides. There was no
reported public response from China. China, which suspended military
exchanges with the U.S. in response to previous sales, protested the
F-16 move. The foreign ministry said the country lodged "stern
representations" with U.S. while the defense ministry warned against
moves that undercut the contention that the mainland and Taiwan are part
of "one China." "Any words or actions that undermine the one-China

### Relations-Good

#### America and China need to maintain good relations with each other

**Tung 18** \[C.H Tung, First chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, 2/08/2018, America and China Need Each Other,
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/america-and-china-need-each-other/>\]
KS

In recent years, the relationship between China and the United States
has been a story of success. [The two countries are each other's
**largest trading partner** and have grown bilateral trade from a value
of \$100 million in 1972 to \$649 billion in 2016.]{.underline}
**[An]{.underline}** extraordinary degree of people-to-people contact in
all walks of life --- from students to tourists to professionals and
academics --- brings our societies closer every day. The 350,000 Chinese
students studying in the United States are a vote of confidence in the
importance of this relationship. More and more Americans, especially
young people, are choosing to visit China and learn Mandarin. There is
much to be proud of. Consequently, as someone who has dedicated much of
my life to enhancing relations between China and the United States, I am
disheartened to read in American newspapers, and to hear from friends in
the United States, that some Americans feel betrayed. They are
disappointed that, after four decades of largely positive relations
between the two countries, including American support for China to enter
the World Trade Organization, China has not become more like America. To
them, China is more like an economic competitor; and strategically, its
moves in the South China Sea and other areas make it a potential rival,
or even adversary. These grievances are serious and warrant a response.
In such a broad and consequential relationship, concerns on both sides
are only natural. In the area of trade, the United States has expressed
its concern about trade deficits, difficulty in accessing the Chinese
market, lack of intellectual property protection, and a higher import
duty in China. On the other hand, Chinese business professionals have
voiced unease over the U.S. government's unreasonable protectionism when
reviewing Chinese investment in the United States, and the fact that the
U.S. has not recognized China's market economy status at the World Trade
Organization. Such disagreements must be worked out in a constructive
way, as rash actions on either side could create the environment for a
trade war. Despite the rhetoric of competition, the **[two economies are
remarkably complementary.]{.underline}** China is short of oil and gas,
which the U.S. has in abundance. China has close to 20 percent of the
world's population but only 7 percent of the world's arable land, while
the U.S. has a strong agricultural production sector. With the rapid
growth of the middle class**,** [China is becoming a significant
consumer market.]{.underline} Rather than imposing a border tax on
Chinese goods entering America, or tariffs such as those recently
announced on foreign-produced solar panels and washing machines, a
better way to reduce the trade deficit would be for China to buy more
goods from the United States. There have already been positive moves in
this direction. In November last year, China and the U.S. signed
agreements that will result in [**China importing \$250 billion worth of
goods** from the United States.]{.underline} Some Americans have
expressed concerns over China's political direction. However, from the
beginning, China never stated that it would adopt an American-style
political system. During Dr. Sun Yat Sen's revolution over 100 years
ago, China tried Western-style democracy, but it only brought about
serious division within the country. It was not until 1949, when the
People's Republic of China was established, that China was eventually
united. Then, it was an impoverished country with little infrastructure,
public education, or health services. The country recognized that the
best way forward was to pursue Marxism with Chinese characteristics.
Despite some ups and downs, China's peaceful development has had
unparalleled success in lifting 700 million people out of poverty,
especially since reforms began in earnest in 1978. During the recent
19th Party Congress, President Xi Jinping stated that China will
continue the process of opening up to the outside world. The country's
goals are clear. In President Xi's words, "We should meet the people's
ever-growing needs for a better life. This better life is not only in
their material and cultural needs, but also in their demands for
democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, security, and a better
environment." I am increasingly concerned that [U.S.-China relations may
become adversarial.]{.underline} The rhetoric and actions taken by
recent U.S. administrations---including building up military alliances
in the Pacific and moving U.S. military deployment from the Middle East
into the Pacific Ocean---have [created the impression that America wants
to contain China.]{.underline} However, China's strategic intent has
always been to promote peace with its neighbors and the rest of the
world. The development of the Chinese military is purely for deterrence
and as a means of self-defense. We have no interest in expanding our
territory or exporting our ideology. We have no military alliances and
have vowed never to use nuclear weapons to strike first. At the moment,
we certainly do not see America as an adversary. As President Xi stated,
China's goal for the future is to become "a proud and active member of
the community of nations of the world." We wish to build a more peaceful
world where countries can share in their prosperity. Our actions on the
international stage have proven this. No country has done more
domestically in recent years to take steps to mitigate the effects of
climate change. No country has contributed more troops to UN
peacekeeping efforts than China. China's economic growth has contributed
greatly to global economic growth, and we are projected to contribute
over 35 percent of global growth in the next two years, according to the
World Bank. The U.S. and China have achieved remarkable things when
working together. In the face of climate change, President Obama and
President Xi came together to push the Paris Climate Conference to its
successful conclusion. During the Ebola crisis in West Africa, the two
countries collaborated resources, and within six months the epidemic was
contained. These are reminders of what we can accomplish if we manage to
bridge the trust gap that exists between the U.S. and China. Faced with
pressing international challenges, such as nuclear proliferation,
climate change, terrorism, massive migration and localized conflict, it
is [essential that we redouble our **efforts to work
together.**]{.underline} We simply cannot afford to be adversarial.

## Taiwan Deterrence 

### A2: Taiwan can not deter

#### Taiwan can deter China-strategists planning for attack without US help 

**Lanoszka 18, (**Alexander Lanoszka is Assistant Professor of
International Relations at the University of Waterloo. Previously, he
taught at City, University of London and has held fellowships at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dartmouth College, November
2018, "A QUESTION OF TIME Enhancing Taiwan's Conventional Deterrence
Posture", Center for Security Policy Studies) DJ

[Our team agreed on two assumptions at the project's outset: first, that
**Taiwan's conventional deterrence posture will be more credible if it
can function without U.S. intervention during a crisis**]{.underline};
and second, that Taiwan's defense budget will not significantly increase
in the near term. We must emphasize that these assumptions do not
necessarily reflect our beliefs about whether the United States might
intervene in a crisis. Some of us firmly believe the United States will
come to Taiwan's diplomatic, economic, and even military aid. Similarly,
we have no doubt that the Tsai Administration and its successors can
generate the political support necessary to increase Taiwan's defense
spending. Instead, we adopted these assumptions to identify a strategy
by which Taiwan might enhance its conventional deterrence posture to the
maximum extent possible under "worst case scenario" conditions. [If
Taiwan's political and military leaders are confident that the United
States will intervene in a crisis, and/or if defense budgets increase
significantly, then some of our recommendations are "overkill." However,
we think that the logic of deterrence means it is better to plan for the
worst---and then adjust those plans when better conditions present
themselves---than the other way around]{.underline}. Our analysis also
primarily focuses on military matters. We do not explore ways that
Taiwan might leverage its diplomatic, economic, and informational assets
to deter aggression. Nor do we suggest how Taiwan can counter China's
long-standing efforts to isolate it diplomatically and economically. We
recognize that emphasizing the military aspects of conventional
deterrence limits our recommendations in important ways, not least
because Taiwan must use all of its sources of national power to deter
aggression. Indeed, the fact that China has been slowly coercing
Taiwan's diplomatic allies and restricting its economic options poses an
important challenge to Taiwan's security. Nevertheless, we focus on
military matters for two reasons. First, Taiwan's security environment
is remarkably complex, and no single research project can plausibly
address all possible challenges and opportunities. The old military
adage that she who is strong everywhere is strong nowhere applies to
policy research as well. Moreover, given our professional and academic
backgrounds in national defense, [we believe that focusing on our
comparative area of expertise makes more sense. Second, **as useful as
Taiwan's nonmilitary tools can be---and as daunting as the nonmilitary
threats to Taiwan's security are---deterrence ultimately rests on the
ability to credibly threaten unacceptable costs on your adversary so as
to convince it not to use violence against you.**]{.underline} Thus,
military considerations must drive Taiwan's conventional deterrence
posture. That said, we recognize that even "pure" military factors do
not operate in a vacuum. For this reason, in Chapter 6 we broaden our
analysis to examine two important nonmilitary factors that are
particularly relevant to Taiwan's conventional deterrence posture:
social resilience and national identity.

the CCP's core strategic approach to Taiwan was to bide their time while
building up national strength. As [Deng Xiaoping famously
proclaimed](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/are-china-taiwan-heading-towards-conflict-17860),
the People's Republic of China (PRC) can wait 100 years to reunify with
Taiwan (also known as Republic of China, or ROC) if necessary. [Today's
CCP appears to be operating within a much shorter time frame, however.
With China's rise to great power status, Beijing wields unprecedented
economic leverage over Taiwan and is increasingly comfortable with

scholars have [frequently
cautioned](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/destined-war-can-america-and-china-escape-thucydidess-trap),
the China-Taiwan relationship is fraught with potential escalatory
spirals that can easily set the two sides on a path to unavoidable
military conflict. What are Taiwan's military capabilities, and how
would it defend itself against a Chinese offensive? Here is what we
found. [Taiwan's capacity to defend its airspace against the might of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is one of the
foremost deciding factors in a prospective military
conflict.]{.underline} For most of the 20th century, Taiwan's security
establishment [was
confident](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/taiwans-military-really-ready-take-china-40682)
that the superior training and equipment of the ROC air force was enough
to offset the PLAAF's vast numerical advantage. In 2019, those

ridiculous, but there's a part that talks about why Trump doesn't need a
bargain for re-election, and depending on what arguments they run, this
might come in handy.

SDD.

Here is my best advice. [Don't waste your time
dot-connecting]{.underline}. [When it comes to China, Trump has done
anything but paint a clear picture]{.underline}. Trump-diviners just got
another lesson in that. The White House recently issued an executive
order banning suspect technologies from the U.S., a directive aimed at
Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies. Separately, the
administration also banned Huawei specifically from buying U.S.
technology, the full impact of which was later delayed for 90 days.
Policy experts have trotted out all kinds of interpretations. One view
argues the delay represents the U.S. yielding to pushback organized by
China. Another holds that the president is just using the whole issue as
a bargaining chip in the trade talks. The Commerce Department continues
to maintain that the ban is serious. Depending on whose dot-connecting
you like, you can draw very different conclusions on what Trump is up
to. But rather than guessing who guessed right, better to start with
what we know than guessing about what we don't. **[Never expect the
administration's relations with China to follow a straight
line]{.underline}.** [Before Trump, the plan was to avoid confrontation
with Beijing]{.underline}. In fact, the U.S. tried to avoid contentious
issues altogether. [Trump turned that approach on its head,
conspicuously looking to confront the Chinese economically,
diplomatically and militarily, forcing them to respect America's
interests.]{.underline} The administration knows this strategy will have
to play out over time rather than end in a showdown at the OK Corral.
There will be some pushing and shoving on both sides, ups and downs,
name-calling and back-slapping. [The White House knows it's riding a
geo-political rollercoaster. So should we]{.underline}. **[There is no
grand bargain]{.underline}. **[Long before there was Trump, there was
talk of a G2, a big deal between the governments in Beijing and
Washington that would divide up the world and tell everyone else what to
do. That was a fear that was unfounded then]{.underline}. [Nothing has
changed]{.underline}. The two sides might make nice now and then, as
when Obama and Xi reached an agreement on cyber-espionage in 2015, but
that's just a pause in the action[. The new normal is don't expect there
to be a normal -- for long, anyway]{.underline}. **[Don't think Trump
needs a deal]{.underline}.** There is a notion that [the White House in
the end will be desperate for deals, any deal, because the president
needs one to burnish his chances of re-election**. Don't bet on
it**]{.underline}. [With a strong economy at his back and bipartisan
support to be "tough on China," the administration not only might not be
desperate for a deal,]{.underline} it could well conclude it's happy to
wait until after the election when the White House might feel it can
negotiate from an even stronger position. There might be a deal. There
might not be. **[Trump has cards to play.]{.underline}** Beijing is not
the irresistible economic juggernaut that many often assume. For
example, [cutting off Chinese ICT manufacturer ZTE from American
products, even though the prohibition was brief, threatened to destroy
the Chinese giant]{.underline}. Trump also showed that supply chain
dependencies are not a one-way street, with China holding the reins of
the chains. [The White House also has shown that global supply chains
aren't fixed]{.underline}. [There are other options. Expect Trump, and
American companies, to consider them]{.underline}**. [Don't lose sight
of Trump's policies.]{.underline}** His rhetoric may be loose; his use
of tariffs questionable; even his interpretation of free-market
economics may be a bit sketchy. That said, in the end, [Trump's policies
often look far more traditional in practice than many assume. The U.S.
hasn\'t become isolationist. It hasn't abandoned its values or its
friends. It hasn't devolved into a managed economy of state-owned
enterprises. **Don't expect America to stop being
America.**]{.underline} So let's remember as we debate the great
questions (Will there be a trade deal? Will Huawei be ultimately
dispatched by Trump to the global doghouse? And whither tariffs?) that
however entertaining it may be to speculate, we shouldn't bet the house
on anyone's ability to connect dots. Zigs when we expect zags should
surprise no one.

There are four basic options for resetting America's China policy:
accommodation, collective balancing, comprehensive pressure, and regime
change. These options are ideal-types: They illustrate the range of
possible approaches and capture distinct analytical logics about the
nature of the China problem and the appropriate response. [At one
extreme, Washington could seek an accommodation with Beijing in hopes of
striking a grand bargain and establishing a cooperative long-term
relationship]{.underline}. At the other extreme, the United States could
seek regime change or even precipitate a military showdown to prevent
China from growing more powerful. Both of [these options assume that
America must take urgent action to "solve" the China
challenge]{.underline}. Yet, [neither of these approaches is realistic,
and]{.underline}, in fact, [each is downright dangerous]{.underline}.
[The real debate involves the two middle options: collective balancing
and comprehensive pressure. Collective balancing would rely on U.S.
cooperation with allies and partners to prevent China from constructing
a regional sphere of influence or displacing the United States as the
world's leading power]{.underline}. Comprehensive pressure would go
further, attempting not simply to counterbalance Chinese influence
overseas but to actively erode China's underlying political, economic,
and military power. These options, in turn, rest on different
fundamental assumptions[. Collective balancing accepts that Chinese
power is likely to expand but assumes that it is possible to prevent
Beijing from using its power in destabilizing way]{.underline}s[.
Comprehensive pressure assumes that China's power must be limited and
even diminished, despite the risk that doing so will sharply escalate
tensions]{.underline}. Probing the logic of these strategies, and
assessing their various strengths and weaknesses, is critical to going
beyond "competition" and adopting a new approach. [The alternative ---
practicing tactics without strategy --- is no way to confront the
daunting geopolitical challenge that China presents.]{.underline}

[It seems unlikely,]{.underline} however[, that even a complete U.S.
capitulation in the South China Sea would lead Beijing to change its
policy]{.underline} fundamentally [on North Korea, Taiwan, or any other
key issue]{.underline}, because [Chinese leaders]{.underline} surely
[would assess that the weakness of the U.S. position on the South China
Sea was compelling the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
seek]{.underline} such [a "grand bargain.]{.underline}" And [as tempting
as accommodation might be]{.underline} for a country with no shortage of
challenges around the globe, the fact is that [the benefits of this
approach would be more than **offset by powerful disadvantages**. A
strategy of accommodation would undercut U.S. alliances and partnerships
in Southeast Asia and beyond]{.underline}, by demonstrating [that the
United States is no longer willing to contest Chinese power in this
area]{.underline}. Washington thereby [would risk forfeiting the
leadership role that the United States long has played in the region,
while perhaps encouraging countries from Vietnam to the Philippines to
align with a rising Beijing]{.underline}. Indeed, if the United States
cannot summon the wherewithal to uphold the rules-based order, then
American leaders should not expect smaller states to do so on their own.
[Moreover, although a policy of accommodation would reduce the risk of
confrontation in the short term]{.underline}, **[it might increase it in
the long term]{.underline}**. The lesson that Beijing surely would take
away from such an approach is that [American redlines are not actually
so red and the country's "ironclad" alliance commitments are not
actually so ironclad]{.underline}; that perception, in turn, could
encourage greater Chinese risk taking that ultimately might transgress a
real American redline and bring the two countries to blows.
[Finally]{.underline}, and perhaps most significantly, **[this approach
would guarantee Chinese hegemony over the South China
Sea]{.underline}**, an area that American policy makers long have deemed
to be of vital economic and geopolitical importance to the United
States. It thereby [would complicate dramatically any U.S. effort to
defend Taiwan, the Philippines, and other partners and allies in the
event of Chinese aggression or coercion]{.underline}. U.S. accommodation
also [would put China well on the path to becoming a regional hegemon of
the sort America always has felt compelled to resist.]{.underline}
Beijing indeed may have a greater interest in the South China Sea than
Washington does, but it hardly follows that the United States has no
interest there worth defending. [**Accommodation**, in other words,
**would have devastating effects** for the U.S. position in the
Asia-Pacific---with no guarantee that it actually would reduce the
danger of an eventual conflict with China]{.underline}

But **[the best the United States can hope for]{.underline}** this week
**[is a \"short-term bargain]{.underline}**,\" said Derek Scissors, a
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
Washington-based think tank. That might include China giving more
details about its plans to open up its auto sector and pledging to
increase imports from the United States. Scissors said [a \"credible
promise\" from Beijing to buy an additional \$50 billion of US goods

#### Bargaining doesn't check -- increases likelihood of conflict

Thus [any bargain involving a reduction in Taiwan's sovereignty should
independently reduce Beijing's expected costs of war]{.underline}, thus
pushing R even further to the right. [The credibility of Beijing's
commitment to such a bargain would]{.underline} therefore [be
suspect]{.underline}, as [once it was implemented Beijing would have
incentives to demand an even more favorable bargain]{.underline} (and
Taiwan would not be in a position where it could refuse). Fearon
develops a similar model where states bargain over strategic territory
and the outcome of the negotiations explicitly shifts the balance of
power.19 [This change in the balance of power happens because the
outcome of the negotiation transfers territory to a rival state
and]{.underline} thereby [improves that rival's fighting
capacity]{.underline}. When this type of dynamic is at work, [reaching a
settlement becomes difficult because the consequence of the shift in
power caused by a settlement may be less desirable than fighting and
forgoing any negotiations]{.underline}. Although a hypothetical bargain
between the PRC and Taiwan is not over strategic territory, it is
certainly possible that [a similar dynamic is at work as the PRC and
Taiwan negotiate over Taiwan's sovereignty.]{.underline} Inasmuch as
[giving up sovereignty to the PRC strengthens the PRC's bargaining
leverage, Taiwan may come to the conclusion that risking war is
preferable to any negotiated settlement with the PRC over
unification.]{.underline} In other words[, Taiwan may conclude that it
would be better to roll the dice in a war with China today than to
accept the terms of an obsolescing bargain likely to result in a
progressively more subordinate status within a unified
Chin]{.underline}a. Therefore, in the same way that bargaining over
strategic territory is complicated by the strategic consequences of any
deal that might be struck, [bargaining over unification can be dangerous
because it has implications for the future bargaining power of the PRC
and Taiwan.]{.underline}

#### china accommodation unlikely - detterance no longer checks bargaining leverage

Yet there are some reasons to think that accommodation in this regard
would be difficult. Recall that [in recent decades the primary strategic
challenge in cross-Strait relations can be characterized as a problem of
deterrence, with the PRC trying to deter Taiwan efforts to redefine its
sovereign status]{.underline} in a way that conflicts with PRC hopes for
unification[. But if R were to shift right of the status quo, the model
suggests that the cross-Strait relationship would instead be
characterized by a problem of compellence. Here, a war could occur, not
because the PRC fails to deter unilateral Taiwan changes to the status
quo, but rather because the PRC fails to compel Taiwan to alter the
status quo]{.underline} in a way that is more to Beijing's liking
(remember that once R shifts right of the status quo, Beijing's expected
war payoff exceeds its utility for a continuation of the status quo).
Nevertheless, [commitment problems could complicate the search for a
peaceful accommodation even if Taiwan]{.underline} recognized that R had
moved to the right of the status quo and even if Taiwan [was in
principle willing to bargain away some of its sovereignty.17 The reason
is that the issue being bargained over, Taiwan's sovereign status, could
affect future bargaining power between the two sides: that is,
bargaining some of its sovereign status to avoid war in the short term
could further diminish Taiwan's future bargaining power vis-à-vis
Beijing.]{.underline}

## A2: Recognize Taiwan 

#### Political science scholarship proves that recognition is internationally perceived and emboldens would-be secessionists

We posit two levels at which religion may shape recognition decisions
--- domestic religious institutions and transnational religious
affinities. Religious institutions vary in the degree to which they
regulate religious life in a given country. States that heavily regulate
religion may do so because of a perceived vulnerability to domestic
threats from groups adhering to other religions. **[[When a non-core
group]{.mark} that is culturally (ethnically and/ or religiously)
distinct [successfully challenges another state, extending recognition
to the aspiring state may set a precedent and embolden noncore
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** at home. **[Previous [scholarly work has
found that "demonstration effects" can play a significant role in
stimulating secession; that is, one key region's separatist actions tend
to encourage other regions to behave similarly]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Hale 2000). **[[States that perceive themselves as vulnerable]{.mark}
to non-core groups, both religious and ethnic, [should therefore prefer
to keep Pandora's Box closed by withholding recognition from aspiring
states]{.mark} abroad and emphasizing the principle of territorial
integrity]{.underline}** (Zartman 1966, 109). This claim extends the
theory of domestic vulnerability, which argues that **[nation-states
facing threats from secessionists at home will be less likely to support
secessionists abroad, for fear of legitimizing the act of secession and
sending mixed signals to domestic audiences and minority groups at
home]{.underline}** (Touval 1972; Jackson and Rosberg 1982; Herbst 2000;
but see Saideman 1997; 2001; 2002; 2007). While the original "domestic
vulnerability" thesis was applied to external support for secessionists,
which often takes clandestine forms that the public does not directly
observe, recognition is a distinct form of external support that is
directly observable to the public in the recognizing state.
**[[Recognition decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}** may **[[send a
relatively clear signal to domestic audiences]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Coggins 2011; Walter 2006). Applying this argument to the study of
international recognition, we theorize that
**[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** facing such a threat [**[will be
less likely to recognize an aspiring state for fear of setting a
precedent that would embolden aggrieved groups at
home]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Recognition collapses US-China relations

Sovereignty? The U.S. Response to China's Diplomatic Pressure,"

Still, **[[even though American administrations have pushed the
boundaries of relations with]{.mark} --- -and support
for --- [Taiwan]{.mark}, [they have carefully avoided any suggestion of
support for its government's claim of independence]{.mark} and sovereign
status]{.underline}**. [**[To cross that red line would be an explicit
rejection of the fundamentals of China's claim to Taiwan that would
shake the foundation of Sino-American relations]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
The analysis in this article suggests that, in its recent reaction to El
Salvador's change in diplomatic partners, the United States has moved
perilously close to that line. The first suggestion of this came in an
unusual August 23 statement by the White House that criticized El
Salvador for having acted in a way that affected "the economic health
and security of the entire American region" by its "government's
receptiveness to Chinese apparent interference in the domestic politics
of a Western hemisphere country." This was said to be a matter of "grave
concern" to the United States that would result in a "re-evaluation" of
its relations with El Salvador. The statement cautioned others regarding
the dangers of economic ties with China and pledged that "\[t\]he United
States will continue to oppose China's destabilization of the
cross-strait relationship and political interference in the Western
Hemisphere." This statement was unlike the State Department
spokesperson's anodyne statement about the importance of peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait made in response Panama's switch to
relations with China in June of 2017. In it she dismissed any threat to
American interests in the area, characterizing the change as "an
internal matter between the Government of Taiwan and Panama." So, in
roughly a year, the American posture on the diplomatic competition
between Taiwan and China had moved from a narrow assessment of its
impact on stability in cross-strait relations to a much wider depiction
reminiscent of the Monroe Doctrine. In this depiction the United States
indicated a willingness to intervene officially in matters beyond the
strait area that affected relations between China and Taiwan. And on
September 11, it was apparent that intervention might constitute more
than a statement, when American envoys to the Dominican Republic, El
Salvador and Panama were recalled to Washington for "consultations
related to the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan." At the
same time in the Congress, Taiwan's supporters rallied to support the
island. Legislation was proposed that would "restrict U.S. funding to El
Salvador" in order to "send a direct message to Taiwan's allies that the
United States will use every tool to support Taiwan's standing on the
international stage and will stand up to China's bullying tactics across
the world." In early September, legislation introduced into the Senate
called for the State Department to report on "actions taken by the
United States to affirm and strengthen Taiwan's international alliances
around the world." It proposed rewarding countries that maintained
diplomatic or unofficial relations with Taiwan while penalizing those
who would downgrade relations. One instance does not, necessarily,
represent a change in policy. Still, it is useful to inquire, first,
whether Washington's reaction to Chinese recognition of El Salvador is
consistent with broader trends in United States China policy and
secondly, whether it represents a change in American policy toward the
cross-strait relations. To answer the first question: the reaction
described above is consistent with the direction American China policy
was taking during the summer of 2018. Sino-American relations under
President Trump continued on the downward trend that had begun in the
last days of the Obama administration. With China identified as a
"revisionist" power and a "competitor" challenging "American power,
influence, and interests," Sino-American disputes arose on issues
ranging from trade to security in the South China Sea. Consistent with
this trend were Washington's recent efforts at "strengthening alliances
and building new partnerships in the area" in response to Beijing's
involvement in Latin America. This direction was aggressively promoted
by Secretary of Defense James Mattis who toured the area the summer of
2018 warning of Chinese economic and military ambitions and proposing
that the United States National Guard link up with South American
military. In contrast to this trend, after the December, 2016 phone call
between Trump and Tsai, the cross-strait issue did not figure
prominently in the worsening Sino-American relationship --- at least as
far as the Executive Branch was concerned. In Congress, Taiwan's
supporters promoted legislation consistent with the overall "hardening"
of China policy. However, the legislation was not a radical departure
from past initiatives regarding arms sales, military cooperation and
visits. Thus, it is not surprising that the Trump administration's
reaction to El Salvador's actions was far more vigorous than reactions
to earlier defections by the island's partners. This was consistent with
the growing concern regarding the direction of Chinese foreign policy,
in general and toward Latin America, in particular. Yet, the content of
the response was neither consistent with earlier responses to the
mainland's attraction of Taiwan's diplomatic partners nor the United
States "One China Policy." Earlier the focus had been on the impact on
stability in the Taiwan Strait area. Now, "political interference in the
Western Hemisphere" was linked to cross-strait relations, implying that
American interests in these relations were not limited to its impact in
East Asia. Moreover, implicit in the White House statement and the
explanation of the recall of diplomats to Washington was that one of
those interests is that Taiwan's remaining formal diplomatic
ties --- especially in the Western Hemisphere --- be maintained. This
was made explicit in the proposed Congressional legislation which not
only promoted the existing American support for Taiwan's "unofficial
relations," but added support for "official relations" to "strengthen
Taiwan's international alliances." The problem here is that **[[Taiwan's
"official relations" are based on the Republic of China being considered
a sovereign state]{.mark} --- a fact denied by both the United States
and China]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[[this denial of Taiwan sovereign
state status is not only one of the few areas of agreement between the
two, it is an important pillar supporting Sino-American
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Since normalization in 1979, it has
allowed the United States to balance the provision of essential support
for Taiwan with some acknowledgement of Chinese
sensitivities]{.underline}**. **[[Although this balance has never really
satisfied China, upsetting it by acknowledging Taiwan's sovereign status
would be catastrophic for Sino-American relations and threaten the
American interest in the security of Taiwan.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
