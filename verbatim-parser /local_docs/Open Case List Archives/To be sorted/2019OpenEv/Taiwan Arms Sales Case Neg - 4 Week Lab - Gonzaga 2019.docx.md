# Strategy Notes 

#### Offensive notes \[you can read the defense for your self\]

Arms sales good offense -- you can read these turns against either
version of the Aff. In early week three, there will also be an Allied
Assurances DA that will have additional cards you could read as a part
of the case debate OR will have impacts you can use to make these turns
bigger. Similarly, you can use some of the card here as link cards to
that DA.

CPs -- there are a variety of CPs in the file to solve the advantages
the other way. There are a few hardline better on China to serve as both
uniqueness CPs if needed or to solve the terminal impacts (with the idea
that a hard line approach is better to solve US China war or China
invasion of ROC).

#### Other notes:

In addition to this file, you should have the China Debate file also
open. Please note some of the advantage answers here may have a few
cards that are also in the China file -- but generally, the debate over
whether China will be greenlighted by the plan does rely on revisions
debate, impact debate that you can find in the China file

# US Arms Sales to ROC good 

### Banning arms sales ensures US-China war

**Halting arms sales to Taiwan simultaneously makes Taiwan more
vulnerable to the PRC and more susceptible to US intervention --
guarantees US-China war with escalation**

**Dittmer, editor of Taiwan and China: A fitful embrace, 2017**

(Lowell, "Introduction," [Taiwan and China]{.underline}, edited by
Lowell Dittmer, 2017, it's a bookity book accessed 7/4/19 GDI-JEM)

Chapters 12 and 13 focus on the other two angles of Taiwan's strategic
triangle. With regard to American policy, [we see an awkward gap between
formal diplo-matic ties and informal security commitments.]{.underline}
In accordance with a "one-China policy" that required states to
officially recognize only the ROC or the PRC, Wash-ington recognizes the
PRC as the one and only China; it dropped both its former defense
alliance and its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in January 1979. [The
United States and China have built their relationship upon recognition
supple-mented by three communiqués]{.underline} (1972, 1979, and 1982),
[reinforced by a booming bilateral trade and investment
relationship]{.underline}, and the relationship has resulted in
important strategic agreements on specific issues such as nuclear
proliferation and climate control. Yet [the United States has hedged by
inserting into its recognition documents a provision for continued sale
of weaponry to a Taiwan it no longer formally recognizes]{.underline}
and by a law (the Taiwan Relations Act) implying continu-ing (if
ambiguous) security protection and upgrading the informal relationship.
In chapter 12, Ping-Kuei Chen, Scott L. Kastner, and William L. Reed
debate [the proposition put forth by some critics of American China
policy that this is not only ambiguous but inconsistent and surely
detrimental to closer Sino-American cooperation, that the United States
should hence rescind its informal security commitment to
Taiwan]{.underline}, and [that, since it has already withdrawn from its
defense alliance and diplomatic relationship with Taiwan it should
withdraw as well the last symbol of support, weapons sales]{.underline}.
In this exercise in rational futurology that conceives of "independence"
and "reunification" as the authors do, [it may indeed be correct that if
the United States stopped selling weapons morale in Taiwan could
collapse and the leaders would become more willing to reunite with the
mainland on Beijing's terms]{.underline}---a result [that would damage
the US regional strategic position and its reputation for honoring
security commitments]{.underline}. But Chen, Kast-ner, and Reed argue
that inasmuch as this is only one possible scenario and not necessarily
the most likely one, [it would be risky for the United States to rescind
weapon sales and for China to apply sanctions to force it to do
so]{.underline}. Why? First, [ces-sation of weapons sales would not
necessarily make Taiwan more willing to submit to the mainland or make
the United States more willing to allow the island to be overrun by
forc]{.underline}e---after all, the United States had no formal security
commitment to Korea when it intervened to resist a North Korean attack
in the summer of 1950 (an alliance was agreed in 1953), or to South
Vietnam in 1964. **[For the United States to halt weapon sales would
make Taiwan a weaker and a more vulnerable target for PRC coercion, but
it would also make Taiwan a more sympathetic victim for the Americans to
rescue in the face of an unprovoked attack, as the futility of
self-defense against an overwhelmingly superior adversary would be
immediately apparent]{.underline}**. Taiwan's reactions are not
necessarily based on rational calculation of the power balance, and
American reactions are not entirely predictable on the basis of paper
commitments.

## Deter China 

### Deter -- general credibility 

#### US arms sales key to Taiwan deterrence credibility -- no one else will defend them 

**Chen**, senior research fellow in The Heritage Foundation's Asian
Studies Center, **2018**

Accessed 7/2/19, GDI -- JMoore)

The [new arms sales]{.underline} will [help Taiwan maintain some
semblance of credibility in its own defense, especially in the air. As
China has increased its pressure on Taiwan]{.underline} (e.g., employing
financial diplomacy to erode Taiwan's diplomatic standing), [preserving
Taiwan's ability to maintain control of its own airspace will be
vital.]{.underline}

[They are part of a larger mosaic of U.S. efforts to express support for
Taiwan]{.underline}, including the 2018 Taiwan Travel Act, the decision
of then-President-elect Donald Trump to take a call from Taiwanese
President Tsai Ing-wen, and the recent opening of a new U.S. diplomatic
facility in Taipei.

This is an important policy[. As Taiwan's most vital partner, the U.S.
must push back against Chinese encroachment on it. If it does not, no
one else will.]{.underline} It also upholds long-standing bipartisan
precedent, set by every American president since Richard Nixon and Jimmy
Carter.

#### US efforts to bulk up ROC defense solely to deter China

One U.S. military official here in Hawaii said the United States must
send a message to China's communist government that it will stand behind
democratic nations, particularly Taiwan. "Anytime a nation says they are
willing to forcibly assault an island, we should be concerned," the
official said. [The United States has sent ships through the Taiwan
Strait three times already this year, and six times in total since last
July]{.underline}. The destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur and Coast Guard
cutter USCGC Bertholf conducted the [most recent transit,]{.underline}
which Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said
"[demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific." The
United States must also put a "premium" on transforming Taiwan's
military and defense capability so it can maintain a deterrent force,
the military official here said. That includes mobile air defense
systems, anti-ship cruise missiles, small fast attack boats, countermine
capability, precision artillery, and modern aircraft to patrol its
airspace. "No one wants to be pulled into World War III," the official
said. In an effort to beef up Taiwan's defenses, the U.S. military sold
more than \$25 billion of equipment to Taipei from 2007 to
2018.]{.underline}

### Deter invasion -- weapons

[Trump administration officials have become increasingly worried about
the intentions of Chinese leaders toward Taiwan]{.underline}, and they
also [regard Taiwan as an important counterweight to China in the
region.]{.underline}

Though China's military capabilities still lag far behind those of the
United States, the People's Liberation Army has worked on weapons
systems, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, that might prove
effective against the United States Navy in the event of conflict in the
Taiwan Strait.

In recent months, the [Pentagon has ordered naval ships to sail through
the Taiwan Strait with increasing frequency, in shows of strength that
officials call freedom of navigation exercises.]{.underline}

[The proposed purchase of tanks and missiles is consistent with Taiwan's
deterrence strategy]{.underline}, said Bonnie S. [Glaser, a senior
adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.]{.underline}

["They would help prevent an invasion, making it difficult for an
invading P.L.A. force to establish a beachhead in northern
Taiwan,]{.underline}" she said, referring to the People's Liberation
Army. "[I expect the Trump administration to approve this package, as
part of a policy of bolstering Taiwan's defenses]{.underline}."

### Greenlights China

Despite calls for regional cooperation and "win-win" scenarios, Wei,
unlike Shanahan, did not once mention international law, except when
questioning the legitimacy of the TRA. Tellingly, [Taiwan was at the top
of Wei\'s list of priorities, with the usual lines on the "inevitability
of unification" and warnings to "separatists" and "external forces" that
the PLA is determined to fight to the end to safeguard China\'s
"territorial integrity]{.underline}." Referring to the South China Sea
as "generally stable and positive," Wei lamented that "in recent years,
some countries outside the region have come to the South China Sea to
flex muscles in the name of freedom of navigation." ["The large-scale
force projection and offensive operations in the region," he said, "are
the most serious, destabilizing and uncertain factors in the South China
Sea]{.underline}." (The previous day the French Minister of the Armed
Forces, Florence Parly, had stuck a combative tone with regards to
France\'s right to conduct passages.) [Wei denied that the structures
built by the PLA in parts of the South China Sea constituted
militarization, adding that those were deployed as the "legitimate
rights of a sovereign state to carry out construction on its own
territory," a statement that defied international law, ruled out the
possibility of contested claims, and upended a timeline showing that
freedom of navigation passages by the U.S. Navy and other countries were
in response to the occupation and militarization of the area by China.
Despite their calls for desired cooperation and insistence that conflict
is not inevitable, the two elephants in the room at SLD19 were drawing
lines in the sand that seemed to increase the likelihood of conflict at
some point]{.underline}. For the other, smaller participants from the
region, their remarks reflected a wait-and-see attitude and the
necessity of hedging. [For Taiwan, the statement of U.S. commitment by
Shanahan]{.underline}, the reaffirmation of Japan\'s support for the
Free and Open Indo-Pacific by Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya, and
France\'s aspirations for a greater role in the region [are reassuring
signals that could result in expanded opportunities for Taipei to play a
constructive role. Meanwhile, Beijing\'s stern response to what it
perceives as foreign encroachment and General Wei\'s unsubtle warning
about Taiwan are both indications that Taipei must engage like-minded
players wisely while continuing to develop its deterrent capabilities
through the acquisition and development of defense articles and the
strengthening, at all levels, of its security partnerships.]{.underline}

## Increase arms sales better 

#### **Increase in arms sales key to defend Taiwan against Chinese agression**

**Moore, former policy fellow at the Foreign Policy Initiative, 2018**

(Evan D., "How Trump Can Advance U.S.- Taiwan Relations," [Perspectives
on Taiwan]{.underline}, edited by Bonnie S. Glaser and Matthew P.
Funaiole, March 2018, it's a book accessed 7/4/19 GDI-JEM)

For the past two decades[, China has conducted an extraordinary military
build-up to enable it to prevail in a conflict over Taiwan.]{.underline}
The Department of Defense reports that from 2007 through 2016, "[China's
official military budget grew at an average of 8.5 percent per year in
inflation-adjusted terms,]{.underline}" and is 14 times larger than
Taiwan's military spending. [Beijing is expected to further increase its
military budget to as much as \$260 billion in 2020.15]{.underline}

As Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, said, "[As the
military spending and capa-bility of the PRC grow every year, the
ability of Taiwan to defend itself decreases]{.underline}."16 Despite
the mainland's military advantages over Taiwan, [**the United States can
still use arms sales to raise the costs of potential Chinese
aggression** to buy time for U.S. assistance during a
conflict]{.underline}. The Trump administration's \$1.42 billion sale
announced in June 2017 was a good first step, but more must be done.17

To that end, Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace told the Senate Armed Services Committee in April that [the United
States should expeditiously transfer to Taiwan "advanced military
equipment, such as strike-fighter aircraft, air-to-air and antiship
missiles, mobile surface-to-air missile systems, naval mines, and
tactical surveillance capabilities,"]{.underline} as well enhanc-ing the
strategic and operational coordination between the United States and
Taiwan. As Tellis says, the objective of these investments is to
"strengthen deterrence and prevent the island from being forced to make
choices regarding unification under coercion or the threat of force."18
In other words[, if the United States is to meet its obligations under
the Taiwan Relations Act, then **Washington should consider a much more
substantial provision of weapons and material to Taipei in its next arms
sale.**]{.underline}

## Checks China Mil Mod

#### US ROC relations higher under Trump -- arms sales key part to check Chinese military modernization 

**Zhu, Professor of Political Science and International Relations at
Bucknell University, 2019**

The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act passed by U.S. Congress and signed
into law by President Jimmy Carter in April 1979 has regulated
\"unofficial\" relations between the U.S. and Taiwan since. But in
practice, [U.S.-Taiwan relations are much stronger than America\'s
relations with most countries.]{.underline} [In particular, every
administration since President Ronald Reagan has sold weapons to Taiwan,
despite an apparent violation of the U.S. commitment to China contained
in the 1982 Communiqué between the two governments.]{.underline} In
their defense, U.S. officials have stressed there is correlation between
arms sales to Taiwan and the PRC\'s peaceful policy toward Taiwan.
[Beijing\'s rapid military modernization has given the U.S. new impetus
for arms sales to Taiwan as U.S.-China strategic rivalry
intensifies.]{.underline}

[President Donald Trump has further elevated U.S.-Taiwan
relations.]{.underline} In 2018, Trump signed several pro-Taiwan
legislations, including The Taiwan Travel Act and The Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act, which reaffirm strong U.S. support for Taiwan.

[The United States will continue to play the \"Taiwan card\" especially
when relations with Beijing are strained. To keep Taiwan\'s unique
status as a separate entity from China but not formally create \"two
Chinas\" or \"One China, One Taiwan\" is probably in the best interest
of the U.S.]{.underline}

## Stop Invasion 

### Cost of war

**Arms sales to Taiwan good -- raise cost of war for China with low risk
to relations, ensuring Taiwan's defense**

**Gomez, policy analyst for defense and foreign policy studies at the
Cato Institute, 2016**

American arms sales to Taiwan would continue under this policy option[.
Arms sales create tension in the U.S.-China relationship, but three
benefits of arms sales mitigate the costs they
create]{.underline}.[^42^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-42)
First, [arms sales complicate PLA planning and raise the costs of
conflict for China.]{.underline} Second, [damage done to U.S.-China
relations as a result of the arms sales is relatively
small.]{.underline} A joint report from the Project 2049 Institute and
the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council on China's reactions to arms sales
concludes, "[Past behavior indicates that the PRC is unlikely to
challenge any fundamental U.S. interests in response to future releases
of significant military articles and services to
Taiwan]{.underline}."[^43^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-43)

Defense Department official now at Singapore\'s Lee Kuan Yu School of
Public Policy, warned China might look to punish any US firms involved
in the sale. The Abrams tank, he noted in a Twitter thread, is made by
General Dynamics which also owns Gulfstream Jets. Beijing could seek to
retaliate against their private jet business, he warned. \"[China
implementing unilateral sanctions]{.underline} against companies

sale. [The Chinese foreign ministry is urging \"the U.S. to fully

[The U.S. should ignore that complaint.]{.underline} After all, [China

President Xi Jinping\'s frequent attestations of Taiwan\'s looming
reunification with China. Although it is not in the U.S. national
interest to exacerbate these tensions to the point of war, neither
should we allow Beijing to pursue an unrestrained hostile policy. That
course of action will only embolden Xi, leading him to believe he can
corral or force Taiwan\'s submission. It will make war more, not less,
likely.]{.underline}

13\. Though [there is room for a mod-est modification of U.S. policy on

committed as a matter of policy, **[would be desta-bilizing and inimical
to the inter-ests of all three parties.]{.underline}**

[The existing policy architecture has gener-ated a delicate balance on
the issue of Tai-wan arms sales]{.underline}. Though the status quo may
not be ideal, it is relatively stable[. A sharp re-duction in U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan, of the type often called for by Chinese officials and
scholars, would disrupt the fragile equilib-rium that obtains today and
possibly lead to unintended consequence]{.underline}s---[such as a shift
by Taiwan toward greater levels of domestic production to compensate for
the loss of articles and services traditionally pro-vided by the United
States, reduced negotiat-ing confidence, and greater internal political
pressures on Taiwanese leaders.]{.underline} We believe that U.S.,
mainland Chinese and Taiwanese interests are best served by the
incremental approach articulated by the 1982 Communi-que.

against the F-16 supplies to Taiwan via its trade talks with the US,
but at the same time suggested that [Washington could be using the

could be used by Washington in trade talks with Beijing,]{.underline}

jets.

senior defense official said an F-35 sale to Taipei likely would not be
approved as it is "just a little leap too far with the advanced

# Advantages Debate

## Cooperation 

### AT US China conflict escalation now over trade 

#### No, China and US both know long term rivalry now -- means won't allow quick escalation of the financial conflict 

**Roubini, 2019**

(Nouriel, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business, "The Coming
Sino-American Bust-Up" Project Syndicate Jun 21, 2019

accessed 7/4 GDI-TM)

[Because China and the US both know that they are in for a decades-long
rivalry, they may well conclude that it is better not to risk a
full-scale conflict and global recession in the short run. Only through
proper preparation over the medium term can the two powers manage a
long-term cold war and the de-globalization that will be necessary to
protect their respective supply chains.]{.underline}

[But this scenario is not particularly stable, and could easily morph
into the first or the second after a few months]{.underline}. [If China
and the US are both motivated by concerns about growth and
financial-market stability, they could overcome their immediate
differences, which would allow for a temporary agreement that postpones
the question of how to manage a larger cold-war rivalry.]{.underline}

In principle, both countries would be better off with a deal, which is
why markets had priced in the first scenario up until this past May,
when negotiations collapsed. For the US, an agreement on good terms
would boost consumer and business confidence, and thus growth, while
reducing inflationary risks from the tariffs.

### Interdependence checks conflict 

#### Comparisons of US-China relationship to Cold War tension inaccurate -- ignores nuances of interdependence between the US and China

**Gewirtz, Director of Yale's Paul Tsai China Center, 2019**

(Paul D., "Can the US-China crisis be stabilized?," Brookings

But that does not mean that China is our enemy or adversary. [It does
not mean we are or should be entering a "new Cold War" with
China]{.underline}---[analogizing the U.S.-China relationship to the
relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the second half of
the 20th century.]{.underline}

**[The "Cold War" comparison is a poor one.]{.underline}** [The U.S. and
China have interdependent and mutually beneficial economies, whereas the
Soviet Union's economy was not significant in our
relationship.]{.underline} The U.S. and China have a huge number of
people-to-people exchanges in every walk of life; the U.S. and Soviet
Union did not. [The Soviet Union's leaders told the United States ["we
will bury you"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_will_bury_you) and the
Soviet Union invaded and occupied numerous foreign countries; China may
be a tough competitor, but it is not seeking to destroy us, is not an
existential threat to us, and is not invading other
countries]{.underline}. Its leaders are proud of what China's system has
achieved, but do not seem to be aggressively trying to export it to
other countries, at least not yet. [Our Cold War strategy with the
Soviet Union was "containment," resting on the ultimately correct
assumption that the Soviet Union would collapse from within; but it's
very unlikely that an awakened and powerful China of 1.4 billion people
will self-destruct if we try to "contain" it.]{.underline}

### Alt causes -- relations

In fact[, it is possible that Xi actually wants a full-scale economic
war as a means of damaging Trump's re-election chances. A new Democratic
president]{.underline} -- even one who accepts the reality of a more
contentious Sino-American rivalry -- [would almost certainly be a more
constructive and honest broker for China to deal with. In the parlance
of the foreign-policy establishment, Xi may see de facto escalation as
the quickest route to regime change in the US.]{.underline}

### ROC arms sales not key -- other sales 

#### Other arms sales to other countries in the region designed to counter China -- OBOR initiative

Policy Studies NOVEMBER 2018 <http://csps.gmu.edu/a-question-of-time/>

Chapter 6 explores ways that [Taiwan can better prepare society for a
potential conflict]{.underline}. Available polling data suggests that
leaders and citizens alike are unsure whether or not the nation has the
resolve to resist invasion. [The fact that severe disagreements abound
in society over whether to fight is problematic. Deterrence depends on
credibility. And credibility depends]{.underline} on the ability to
field a well- trained, well-equipped fighting [force motivated by the
knowledge that it enjoys the support of the people it
defends.]{.underline} This requirement becomes especially critical if an
asymmetric military response of the sort we advocate is to be adopted.
Although many of these challenges are beyond the scope of this project,
we offer several tentative suggestions for enhancing social resilience,
including the introduction of Universal Military Training. Chapter 7
summarizes and concludes.

### ROC arms sales not key -- Chinese soft power

#### Any effective cross strait strategy has to account for China's hard [and]{.underline} soft power---no just hard power -- plan only focuses on hard power 

**Kalimuddin and Anderson, 18**

\[Mikail, BA in political science and economics and MA in economics from
Brown University, AND David, supervisory professor in the Department of
Joint, Interagency, and Multinational Operations at the US Army CGSC,
"Soft Power in China's Security Strategy," Strategic Studies Quarterly,
Fall 2018, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26481912, acc. 7/3/19,
GDI-LBP\]

The immediate implication for policy makers is self-evident: [any
strategy for dealing with Chinese actions that hopes to be effective
must account for both the hard and soft power strategies employed by
China]{.underline}. As an example, i[f the US' withdrawal from the TPP
is considered solely from the perspective of hard power, it would appear
to have little direct impact on the SCS disputes]{.underline}.
Ostensibly, [the withdrawal has implications]{.underline} for US
influence in the Asia-Pacific in general, [but it is difficult to
identify how it might relate to China's strategy in the SCS disputes
specifically.]{.underline} [If, however, we consider the soft power
strategic aim of "making China a preferred partner,"]{.underline} then
[it becomes apparent that the withdrawal provides China with a strategic
opportunity to]{.underline} advance this aim through a competing
agreement like the RCEP, which advances China's agenda of substituting
US leadership of the regional economic order with its own.

[By understanding China's soft power]{.underline} strategy, [policy
makers can more accurately and comprehensively assess the impact of
their decisions. With the SCS disputes, ignoring Chinese soft power may
lead policy makers to underestimate the extent to which China can
influence the various actors involved and shape the situation to its
advantage.]{.underline} That being said, while a hard power--centric
counterstrategy may fall short to some degree, it would not be
misdirected in this particular case. [With cross-strait relations,
however, a lack of attention given to Chinese soft power is likely to
have more serious consequences. A hard power analysis would fail to
identify an entire aspect of China's strategy---Chinese actions directed
at the people of Taiwan, rather than just the politics of
Taiwan.]{.underline}

### ROC arms sales not key -- Anti-Tsai media blitz

#### China is influencing Taiwan's media with anti-Tsai messages on cross strait relations -- destabilizing the political process in ROC

Enterprise Institute, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," The

[The Tsai government must also counter the Chinese narrative that
problems in cross-Strait ties are due to her intransigence.]{.underline}
On the one hand, this requires a relatively straightforward public
relations effort. The challenge, however, i[s not simply one of
effective government communications. Over the past decade, China's
influence on Taiwan's media expanded in troubling ways,]{.underline}
according to Chien-Jung Hsu, a researcher at Australia's Monash
University:

First, [the PRC uses economic affiliation as a means to coopt some
Taiwanese media]{.underline}. It attempts to manage the ownership,
editorial content, coverage, and criticism of China in various media by
enabling pro-Beijing tycoons to acquire media on the island. . . .
[Second,]{.underline} as the political orientation of business leaders
generally pivots on their businesses, [the PRC puts pressure on those
Taiwan media owners who have invested or intend to invest in
China.]{.underline} Thus, those media outlets will tend to side with
China or self-censor on any issue related to China. . . . [Third, the
Chinese authorities publish various types of advertorials disguised as
news coverage in Taiwanese media]{.underline}. This placement tactic
facilitates political influence by providing a source of advertising
revenue, often [thereby making Taiwan's media into virtual propaganda
agents of the Chinese authorities]{.underline}. . . . Above all,
increasing and closer cross-Strait economic ties have put China in a
dominant position with respect to some Taiwan media.

## AT Grey Zones Internal link 

#### Grey area incursions reflect revisionist powers disruption of the system 

**Wright, fellow and director of the Project on International Order and
Strategy at the Brookings Institution, 2015**

(Tom, "Deterrence and Great Power Revisionism ," German Marshall Fund of
the United States, May 2015, Transatlantic Security and Future of NATO
Series, accessed 7/6/19, GDI -- JBII)

Revisionists' Strategic Advantage

To understand how to deter Russian and Chinese efforts, it is necessary
to grasp one key feature of a revisionist strategy of territorial
expansion: [revisionist states traditionally go after the non-vital
interests of their great power rivals.]{.underline} [When a rival power
threatens your vital interests, it is clear that you should push back.
But what is the responsible course of action when the dispute is over
something that hardly anyone has ever thought about]{.underline} or
sometimes even heard of?

Of course, the term non-vital interest is somewhat misleading and only
holds true when viewed narrowly and in isolation. The way in which a
state increases its influence matters profoundly. [For example,
annexation and unprovoked invasion constitute a major breach of the
peace and threaten vital U.S. interests. Moreover, while small rocks or
strips of territory may be of limited strategic importance individually,
they can acquire a much greater value in the aggregate.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [the fact that no treaty has been breached and the
territory itself seems to be of limited importance is highly significant
to the dynamics and psychology of any given crisis.]{.underline} [The
small strategic value of the territory in dispute with a revisionist
state usually appears to the dominant power to be vastly and inversely
proportionate to the extraordinary cost that would be incurred by going
to war over it.]{.underline} [This is the great advantage that a
revisionist power has and one that it can ruthlessly
exploit]{.underline} as long as it does not overstep its mark. After
all, what U.S. president wants to risk nuclear war for the Donbas? To
put it another way, how many vital interests is a state willing to
jeopardize for a non-vital one? Therefore, [if the revisionist power is
smart,]{.underline} and it usually is, [it will pick territories
precisely because they lack significant strategic value to rival great
powers, even if they are viewed very differently by the smaller country
upon which it preys.]{.underline}

The revisionist state can also reduce the risk of a military response by
Western powers with another tactic. T[he aggression must not take the
form of an outright invasion but instead it must involve something else,
such as coercive diplomacy to address the "plight" of its nationals
stuck outside its borders or using civilian assets to establish facts on
the ground. Done in this way, the situation will appear complicated. And
a "complicated" situation in a place that is "not vital" immediately
undercuts domestic and international support for a robust
response.]{.underline}

#### Turn Accommodation of revisionist power must be rejected to maintain international order.

**Wright, fellow and director of the Project on International Order and
Strategy at the Brookings Institution, 2015**

(Tom, "Deterrence and Great Power Revisionism ," German Marshall Fund of
the United States, May 2015, Transatlantic Security and Future of NATO
Series, accessed 7/6/19, GDI -- JBII)

Revisiting and Rejecting Accommodation

[The complexity of the revisionist challenge is such that accommodation
is likely to make a comeback, at least in some quarters.]{.underline}
[It will be framed, as it usually is, as part of a diplomatic effort
that facilitates additional influence for the revisionist state in
exchange for some restraint or cooperation on its part.]{.underline}
Although this challenge is in its very early stages, there are multiple
examples of Western strategic thinkers making this case for Europe (e.g.
Jeremy Shapiro and Stephen Walt) and East Asia (Hugh White). These
thinkers point out that most revisionist states are not the second
coming of Nazi Germany so a negotiated settlement stands a better
prospect of success.

[Accommodation remains a bad idea however, both for old and new
reasons.]{.underline} [The only case in which accommodation has ever
truly "worked" was in the case of Britain's appeasement of the United
States in the late 19th century.]{.underline} But it worked for a very
particular reason. British appeasement of the United States certainly
did not satiate Americans. The United States pocketed the concessions
and kicked Britain out of Western Hemisphere. The story had a happy
ending only because the United States acted in a way commensurate with
Britain's long-term interests. Specifically, the United States
intervened on Britain's behalf in two world wars. [U.S. hegemony worked
out pretty well for Britain, if not for the British Empire.]{.underline}

[For the U.S. precedent to be a good one for Russia or China, one would
have to believe that these countries would be equally well disposed to
protecting long-term U.S. interests as the United States was with
Britain.]{.underline} To pose the question is to know the answer. For
whatever hope there is of thinking that a democratic Russia or a
democratic China would uphold the rules of the international order,
[there is no reason to think that Russia's dictatorship or China's
authoritarian regime would do so. Instead, they would likely build on
their gains, albeit gradually, and challenge the regional order in
Europe and Asia.]{.underline}

[The second reason accommodation will not work is that we live in a
post-colonial world.]{.underline} Britain pursued appeasement because it
was an empire and existed in an age of empires. It had possessions it
could give away, regardless of what the locals felt. And, it felt little
compunction about selling out small states in central and eastern
Europe, since the very existence of these states struck them as odd ---
more the result of an idealist U.S. president than clear-headed balance
of power thinking. We, by contrast, live in a postimperial age. [The
United States leads an order in which it enjoys a privileged position
but it does so only because the vast majority of states want it to be
that way.]{.underline} [In an order dominated by democracies, the United
States cannot just sit down with its competitors and rewrite the futures
of independent countries. The very spectacle would be stomach turning
and hugely damaging to the legitimacy of the order. Moreover, the states
affected would take matters into their own hands. We would see a return
to regional rivalries in short order.]{.underline}

intervention against Taiwan.]{.underline}12 Additional announcements are

parts that are critical for its indigenous submarine program to selling
it F-15 fighters or F/A-18 multirole combat aircraft. [The
administration is aware that hardware alone will not counter China's
gray-zone challenge of unconventional and political warfare, economic
pressure, and other forms of coercion. Even so, defense capabilities
remain a necessary, if insufficient, pillar of Taiwan's
security.]{.underline}

#### Conflicts won't escalate -- multiple empirical examples

(Ian, "ESCALATION AT SEA Stability and Instability in Maritime East
Asia," U.S. Naval War College Press, Autumn 2018, JSTOR, accessed
7/3/19, GDI -- JBII)

[To maintain legitimacy in contested waters, states are required to
undertake operations to assert and defend their perceived rights. This
can take the form of sailing through disputed waters, exploiting
maritime zones for economic purposes, or performing law-enforcement and
naval operations consistent with sovereign control.]{.underline} Absent
an intervening authority such as the United Nations, political agreement
on land, or compatible interpretations of the UNCLOS regime, [this can
create substantial friction, leading to clashes among military vessels,
other state-controlled vessels, and civilian vessels such as fishing
boats. This friction has been illustrated in a number of clashes between
democratic countries over maritime economic exploitation
rights.]{.underline} [The "Lobster War"]{.underline} between Brazil and
France in early 1963, [the "Cod Wars"]{.underline} between Iceland and
the United Kingdom in the mid-1970s, and [the Canadian-Spanish "Turbot
War"]{.underline} in 1995--96 all saw democratic countries deploying
military force to assert their perceived maritime economic rights
against other democracies. Similarly, [a 2006 incident between South
Korea and Japan over exploration in a potentially lucrative fishing zone
surrounding the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima Islands saw military and
maritime law-enforcement assets being deployed to assert both countries'
claims.]{.underline} 13

This type of [deployment of military and civilian maritime
law-enforcement actors to contested maritime zones has not yet resulted
in substantial levels of escalation.]{.underline} The
[three]{.underline} earliest [cases described above each ended with a
political solution, while the fourth, between South Korea and
Japan,]{.underline} has [resulted in sustained but low-level instability
characterized by the periodic dispatch of military and civilian
law-enforcement assets]{.underline} to indicate the respective country's
claims.

As represented in table 1, data extracted from the [Dispute Narratives
of the Military Interstate Dispute dataset provide further evidence of
sustained lowlevel instability at sea.]{.underline} However, [in no case
did this instability evolve into war;]{.underline} indeed[, no
substantial escalation occurred past the initial clash.]{.underline} 14
These data indicate that [instability and clashes are to be expected in
contested maritime environments, but substantial escalation, including
to the point of interstate war breaking out, is unlikely.]{.underline}

Notably, [operations in waters with disputed maritime boundaries
accounted for over 40 percent of the interstate disputes at
sea.]{.underline} [These were caused primarily by resource-exploitation
operations, including fishing and oil exploration. In several
cases---notably in the Gulf of Fonseca, on the Pacific coast of Central
America---multiple interactions took place within short periods, but
there is no evidence that any escalation in the level or mode of
violence occurred. In a number of theaters, including the South and East
China Seas, economic and strategic operations in disputed waters
resulted in the consistent display and use of force to enforce perceived
maritime rights, yet again no further escalation occurred.]{.underline}

Unlike Russia, [China has not yet used direct military power to assert
its territorial claims, but it is using such harsh coercion
that]{.underline}---like Russia--- [it is causing extreme apprehension
in its neighbourhood]{.underline}. [China continues to assert the right
to use military force to recover Taiwan and has built up powerful
military forces opposite Taiwan specifically designed to retake the
island. The key unknown is when will Beijing lose patience with the
waiting process and judge that Washington lacks the fortitude to go to
war with China over Taiwan.]{.underline} The Pentagon's latest report to
Congress makes it clear that [China continues to focus on preparing for
potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait and that the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) is developing and deploying military capabilities intended to
coerce Taiwan or to attempt an invasion]{.underline}, if necessary.19
However, the Pentagon report also observes that large-scale amphibious
invasion is one of the most complicated and difficult military
operations and that an attempt to invade Taiwan would strain China's
armed forces and 'invite international intervention'.20

in the East China Sea garnered less attention]{.underline}. Unlike the
South China Sea, there were no new islands being constructed out of
sand, no high-stakes arbitral rulings, and no sharp policy debates in
Washington that spilled out into the press. Despite the lower profile,
**[the dispute in the East China Sea may carry greater risk of drawing
the United States into conflict with China than the various disputes in
the South China Sea.]{.underline}** Here's why:

First, **[the situation in the South China Sea is and will remain at a
stalemate]{.underline}**. As Singaporean official [Bilahari
Kausikan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-04-17/asia-trump-era)
has observed, W[ashington cannot force Beijing to abandon the artificial
islands it has constructed or stop China from deploying military assets
on them without risking a military conflict.]{.underline} By the same
standard, [China cannot stop the United States from operating in the
area without risking a major conflict that would expose Chinese forces
to significant risk of defeat and potentially result in the rapid
destruction of its artificial islands.]{.underline} In other words,
[neither roll-back nor exclusion are policy options that attract serious
consideration by governments in Beijing or Washington.]{.underline}

Second, [the geopolitical temperature on the South China Sea has gone
down considerably over the past year.]{.underline} [Reasons for this
include:]{.underline} President [Trump's de-emphasis of the issue as an
element of the U.S.-China relationship; Beijing's prioritization of
regional economic integration via the Belt and Road Initiative; and
Southeast Asian countries' growing wariness of poking China]{.underline}
on the South China Sea and preference instead for focusing on regional
connectivity and negotiations toward a China-ASEAN Code of Conduct.

Third, [risk-mitigation measures are more mature in the South China Sea
than the East China Sea.]{.underline} Whereas the United States and
China have implemented protocols to prevent unsafe and unprofessional
encounters at sea or in the air and gained experience managing incidents
when they arise, the same types of risk management mechanisms are not in
place between China and Japan in the East China Sea.

Fourth, and relatedly[**, the frequency of close-in encounters between
Chinese and Japanese ships and aircraft in the East China Sea is
intensifying**. This trend likely will accelerate as China and Japan
each follow through on plans to introduce more air and maritime
capabilities to defend their contested claims in the East China
Sea.]{.underline}

Fifth, [China and Japan have a hardened view of each other as strategic
competitors. Events in the East China Sea take on heightened
significance because the dispute is perceived in both countries as a
proxy for how they will relate to each other as Asian
powers]{.underline}. On top of that, [recent history has demonstrated
that incidents in the East China Sea can activate public emotions
rapidly and, in so doing, limit political space for leaders in Beijing
and Tokyo to de-escalate.]{.underline}

#### No real threat of escalation to war in South/East China Sea -- no incentive for military conflict

**Kristof, columnist for the New York Times, 2019**

Relations, 2/19/19, [https://www.cfr.org/event/future-us-china-relations

Director for Asia Studies, Council on Foreign Relations, Stephen A.
Orlins, president, Nation Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and Ely
Ratner, Executive Vice President and Director of Studies, Center for a
New American Security

Let me ask about the security sphere. And, Ely, this is something you've
explored a lot. [Should be concerned about the South China Sea, the East
China Sea, and about some security incident spiraling out of
control?]{.underline}

RATNER: So I think the question is what should we be concerned about? [I
have tended to believe that these analogies to World War I or Thucydides
are not the right lens through which to view the U.S.-China
competition]{.underline}. I think **[the likelihood of a small incident
or crisis spiraling into World War III is quite low]{.underline}**. So
I'll put that on the record, saying that. We'll see. [I am much more
worried about a creeping Chinese sphere of influence, often in what
military strategists call gray-zone tactics]{.underline}---nibbling away
below the threshold of military activity, which they've done in the
South China Sea, which could result in the development of a---[of
Chinese sphere of influence, which could have a whole set of knock-on
effects into the economic sphere, and the political sphere.]{.underline}

So [I'm more worried about that set of trends versus a very near-term
military clash. I think we have fairly good communications with the
Chinese militar]{.underline}y. Some of it's institutionalized. And
**[the incentives for military conflict at this point are extremely
low.]{.underline}** And to my earlier point, [if the U.S. gets its
defense strategy right, I think it will stay that way.]{.underline}

#### **No South China Sea escalation -- defensive Chinese posture and US preoccupation with domestic affairs**

[The South China Sea as well as the countries that border
it,]{.underline} which Fu referred to as \"the backyard of
China[,\" offer the United States a key line of defense against China's
navy.]{.underline} [The Philippines, for example, has a current alliance
with the United States that allows American troops to [land on its
military
bases](https://thediplomat.com/2018/04/why-the-new-us-philippines-military-pacts-first-project-launch-matters/).]{.underline}
If the Philippines successfully claim disputed lands in the South China
Sea, the United States will establish a defense system close to China's
maritime border, which will become a big threat to the Chinese mainland.

[Despite its military superiority and strong opposition to U.S.
intervention in the South China Sea, Beijing adopts a cautious,
defensive, strategic doctrine against the United States. It can be
summarized in two keywords: \"anti-access\" and
\"area-denial.\"]{.underline}

[\"It means China's strategic posture is not to defeat or compete with
the United States,\" but to make it more costly for the United States to
intervene --]{.underline}\"we don't want you to come into our
area,\" Tong explained.

[Will the South China Sea tension become a prelude of a real U.S.-China
naval war?]{.underline} Tong says, [**\"No.\" **Given Washington's
preoccupation with domestic political issues and overseas conflicts as
well as China's defensive posture, \"the United States is unwilling and
unable to engage in a military conflict with China,\" ]{.underline}he

Overall, [congressional oversight ensures the president's adherence to
the Taiwan Relations Act,]{.underline} enacted in 1979. In addition,
[Congress uniquely acts as guarantor in the U.S. government to maintain
the Six Assurances]{.underline} that President Ronald Reagan offered to
Taiwan in 1982.3

[Many members see shared interests between the United States and Taiwan,
a fellow democracy, and have issued statements and taken actions
supporting closer engagement with the island.]{.underline} When the
Trump administration notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan in June
2017, [Senators Bob Menendez]{.underline} (the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee) [and James Inhofe]{.underline} (the
second-highestranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,
after the chairman John McCain) [issued a bipartisan statement as
co-chairs of the Senate Taiwan Caucus. They expressed support for the
arms sales as promoting U.S. interests in a peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan question and a strong, vibrant, and democratic
Taiwan.4]{.underline}

In a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump before his visit to
Beijing in November 2017, which Taiwan feared would result in a deal at
its expense, [Representatives Ed Royce and Eliot Engel]{.underline} (the
chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee) [reminded the president that the United States and Taiwan
"have fostered a close relationship that has been of significant
strategic and economic benefit to both nations; and our two peoples are
bound by shared values of democracy, human rights, and rule of law."5
Likewise, in December 2017, after a PRC diplomat threatened Taiwan,
Senator Tom Cotton promptly issued a statement in which he countered, "I
take Beijing's threats to use military force against Taiwan
seriously.]{.underline} [That's why I urge both the president and
Congress to accelerate the sale of defensive weapons to Taiwan, as well
as to bring Taiwan into joint military exercises with the United States.
We can't afford to take Beijing's saber-rattling lightly."]{.underline}6

In February 2018[, Senator Inhofe led a delegation of the Senate and
House Armed Services Committees to visit Taiwan and other partners.
Inhofe expressed U.S. support for Taiwan: "With China becoming more
aggressive and intent on expanding its influence globally, the United
States--Taiwan security relationship is now more important than
ever."]{.underline}7 The congressional delegation met with Taiwan's
president Tsai Ing-wen and senior ministers.

#### 2018 NDAA proves that arms sales and ROC policy built around them popular with Congress \[so the plan is unpopular\]

[In 2017, bills for the FY2018 NDAA in the House and Senate included
provisions to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership and re-establish
exchanges of naval port calls.]{.underline} [The House bill also sought
to normalize the process for arms sales.]{.underline} [The Senate bill
sought to direct the defense secretary to support Taiwan's undersea
warfare with technical assistance, invite Taiwan to participate in a Red
Flag air exercise, and report on enhancing military-to-military
exchanges at senior levels due to the Pentagon's failure to act on the
recommendation in the previous NDAA.]{.underline} As noted earlier, the
proposal for naval port calls became relatively controversial. Still, in
the markup of the bill in June 2017, the Senate Armed Services Committee
not only voted to approve Senator Cotton's proposal but did so in a
bipartisan, decisive manner (21 to 6).

Some factors affected consideration of the FY2018 NDAA. [China strongly
opposed these and other bills supporting Taiwan's defense]{.underline}.
Its pressure campaign against members and staffers included an egregious
letter from the PRC ambassador last August that threatened "severe
consequences" for the U.S.-PRC relationship.9 Beijing likely noticed
that Randall Schriver had advocated naval ship visits in 2016 and was
reported in 2017 as a potential pick to be assistant secretary of
defense for Asia, a position to which he was appointed in January
2018.10 Both the House and the Senate discussed whether forward-leaning
language would rock the boat by changing the "one China" policy, the
status quo or situation in the Taiwan Strait. [The Pentagon had
reservations about mandates on policies, limits on constitutional
prerogatives, and assistance for any foreign undersea
warfare.]{.underline}

In the end, [Congress approved the FY2018 NDAA with compromises on
controversial language.]{.underline} [The final version included
language about the "sense of Congress" recommending a stronger
partnership with Taiwan, regular arms sales, Taiwan's participation in
air and naval exercises, senior-level military-to-military exchanges,
expanded training for Taiwan's military, and consideration of the
advisability and feasibility of re-establishing naval port
calls]{.underline} (rather than the Senate's proposed directive to
re-establish naval port calls). [The FY2018 NDAA also included a
mandatory yet noncontroversial provision to normalize the arms sales
process by requiring reports and briefings from the defense secretary on
Taiwan's requests for security assistance.]{.underline} The legislation
did not include a provision on Taiwan's undersea warfare capability.

## Xi \[WIP\]

### 1nc link -- plan good for Xi

#### ROC key issue of credibility for Xi -- must deliver 

**Mazza, 18**

\[Michael, research fellow, foreign & defense policy, at the American
Enterprise Institute, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," The
American Interest, 6/28/18,

Xi Jinping's China Dream

[The ineffectiveness of Beijing's approaches for Taiwan thus far have
been laid bare at a time when unification is perhaps becoming more
important to the Chinese leadership]{.underline}. Since X[i]{.underline}
Jinping's [declaration]{.underline} in 2012 [that "to realize the great
renewal of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream for the Chinese
nation in modern history," it has become clear that Xi is a leader cut
from a different cloth than his immediate predecessors.]{.underline}
Through a crackdown on civil society entailing a re-extension of state
power, a years-long anti-corruption campaign at times indistinguishable
from an old-fashioned purge, and a more assertive foreign policy[, Xi
has sought to strengthen the role of the CCP at home and his own role
within it, and from that base to enhance PRC power abroad.]{.underline}

At the same time, [Xi Jinping has made some big promises.]{.underline}
In his work report to the 19th Party Congress last November, Xi asserted
that by mid-century the CCP would "develop China into a great modern
socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally
advanced, harmonious, and beautiful." The Chinese economy, however, may
well enter a protracted period of stagnation. [Slowing growth, soaring
debt, demographic challenges, and the central role of the CCP and of
state-owned enterprises in the economy all point to significant
headwinds.]{.underline} As Dan Blumenthal and Derek Scissors argue,
"[Absent powerful pro-market reform that is nowhere in sight, true
economic growth will halt by the end of this decade, no matter what the
government claims."]{.underline}

[To the extent that Xi cannot deliver on promises of widening
prosperity, his other targets become more important. As such, his
comments on military power and on Taiwan to the 19th Party Congress take
on added significance]{.underline}. Regarding the former, [Xi asserted,
"]{.underline}We will make it our mission to see that [by 2035, the
modernization of our national defense and our forces is basically
completed; and that by the mid-21st century our people's armed forces
have been fully transformed into world-class forces."]{.underline} With
respect to Taiwan, [Xi explained that Taipei's acceptance of the '92
consensus and the "One China" principle is a precondition for the
"peaceful development" of cross-Strait relations and for cross-Strait
dialogue.]{.underline} Then, in what was one of the biggest applause
lines of his speech, Xi drew a line in the sand:

We stand firm in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and will never allow the historical tragedy of national
division to repeat itself. An[y separatist activity is certain to meet
with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people. We have the resolve,
the confidence, and the ability to defeat separatist attempts for
"Taiwan independence" in any form]{.underline}. [We will never allow
anyone]{.underline}, any organization, or any political party, at any
time or in any form, [to separate any part of Chinese territory from
China!]{.underline}

### F-16 link 

#### **Sales of F-16Vs places domestic pressure on Xi -- perceived as having miscalculated foreign policy**

<https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/why-a-us-sale-of-fighter-jets-to-taiwan-matters/>
accessed 7/7/19 GDI-JEM)

[Xi took a great risk in abandoning the rhetoric and diplomacy of
China's "peaceful rise,"]{.underline} which was promulgated by his
predecessor Hu Jintao. Previously admired for his iron determination to
achieve China's great "rejuvenation," [Xi is now being criticized
domestically for overreach and miscalculation]{.underline}. It is
speculated that the legitimacy of the Communist Party would not survive
the "loss" of Taiwan. **[If the United States goes ahead with the sale
of F-16Vs to Taiwan, then the pressure on a president who has embarked
on an unprecedented "anti-corruption campaign" to silence political
enemies and doubters will be immense.]{.underline}**

### Needs to be hardline on US

#### Xi hardline on US to avoid pressure from internal CCP forces

Moreover, [Xi is not an absolute ruler.]{.underline} While he controls
most of the levers of power[, there are still factions
within]{.underline} the Communist Party of China ([CPC]{.underline})
that [could turn on him if he does not mount a sufficiently aggressive
response to the US.]{.underline} [He is not in a position to accept a
deal in which he -- or China -- loses face or power]{.underline}. If
America's medium- to long-term goal is to contain China, as the Trump
administration's National Security Strategy clearly suggests, [Xi cannot
agree to anything in the short term that advances that agenda. In the
grand scheme of things, it might be better to start a full-scale
conflict now than to grant the US a tactical advantage for the next two
years.]{.underline}

### Xi benefits from tension 

#### China can retaliate via economic measures -- including dumping bonds -- and Xi benefits from tension with US 

**Roubini, 2019**

Sino-American Bust-Up" Project Syndicate Jun 21, 2019

accessed 7/4 GDI-TM)

Yet, as we have seen, the conflict is about much more than tariffs, and
China can retaliate in a number of ways. In addition to imposing new
non-tariff barriers, it can strike a blow against major US firms that
rely on Chinese supply chains and consumer markets, while allowing the
renminbi to weaken. And if tensions escalate too far, China could even
resort to the nuclear option of dumping its massive holdings of US
Treasuries; it has already started to reduce its holdings of such US
assets. Moreover, US leaders may be underestimating the costs of the
conflict. According to the prevailing narrative, the tariffs now in
place have had only a modest impact on US growth and inflation. But the
latest economic data suggest otherwise, as the US and global economy are
slowing. In fact, one reason why the Fed has started considering
preemptive insurance rate cuts -- likely to start in July -- may be that
it is worried that tariffs are hurting the US economy more than was
initially anticipated. Making matters worse, the US has nowhere near as
many tools to respond to macroeconomic shocks as China does. In addition
to massive stimulus and currency depreciation, China's government can
bail out private and public enterprises at will. The US, by contrast,
must rely on traditional monetary and fiscal tools, all of which are
already severely constrained. And while Trump must worry about
re-election, Xi has abolished presidential term limits, faces few
constraints on his power, and presides over a sprawling apparatus of
social control, including the Great Firewall of online censorship.THE
ART OF "NO DEAL" [Politically, then, it is much easier for China to take
the long view, which is what Xi has done by announcing a "new Long
March" --]{.underline} a reference to the People's Liberation Army's
long, painful retreat in the 1930s to a new stronghold in Shaanxi
province, from which it broke out and took over all of China, under Mao
Zedong, in 1949[. By wrapping himself in the Chinese flag and fomenting
nationalism at home, Xi is preparing Chinese society for a protracted
struggle. If a full-scale cold war ensues, he will be able to remind the
Chinese of the need to suffer today to achieve glory
tomorrow.]{.underline}

### Needs control of SCS

#### Pressures make Xi vulnerable if he doesn't follow through on aggressive SCS claims

(Paul, "New Directions in Strategic Thinking 2.0," ANU Press, 2018,
JSTOR, accessed 7/2/19, GDI -- JBII)

[Tensions now seem likely to rise, but it remains to be seen what
Beijing's next steps will be.]{.underline} Australia's former Ambassador
to China believes that in the end all that is left is diplomacy and that
negotiation between claimant states is the only path towards some sort
of resolution.29 At the same time, [he recognises that China's leaders
are now under enormous popular pressure to be seen to be standing up for
China's territorial sovereignty. Any sign of weakness in the face of
what will be seen widely in China as a national humiliation will provide
a legitimate opening to attack Xi Jinping.]{.underline} [Beijing could
respond belligerently to the arbitral finding by more aggressively
building and militarising various structures, moving more oil
exploration and drilling platforms into the area, and increasing its
harassment of fishing boats from other claimant states.]{.underline}30
But the fact is that [there is now a much greater chance of
miscalculation or an accidental military confrontation.]{.underline}
There are those who believe that China and the United States are now so
intertwined economically that military conflict is out of the question
and that now is the time for restraint[. That might be true, but in my
view the time has come when the United States and its allies---including
Australia---will have to demonstrate to China that it cannot make
unilateral territorial land grabs. That will involve us undertaking
deliberate freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea and
conducting regular intrusive aerial surveillance.]{.underline}

"national rejuvenation," "strategic opportunity," and "China's great

# Counterplans 

## Hardline Policy towards/create a check on China 

### Increase ROC Defense 

#### Increasing entirety of defense solves 

**Mazza, 18**

\[Michael, research fellow, foreign & defense policy, at the American
Enterprise Institute, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," The
American Interest, 6/28/18,

Of course, to reassure the population that Taiwan's fate is not at the
mercy of the Chinese Communist Party, [Taipei must field a military
capable of deterring aggression and of successfully defending the island
in the event of a conflict. Although Taiwan's armed forces are well
trained, deterring and defending against Chinese adventurism is becoming
increasingly difficult as China's own military capabilities
advance.]{.underline} [Historically a well-equipped force, Taiwan has
found it increasingly difficult to procure modern armaments for its
armed forces.]{.underline}

[In October 2017, Tsai Ing-wen committed to growing Taiwan's defense
budget by 2 percent each year, and as much as 3 percent should another
country (namely, the United States) sell more arms to the island. She
also suggested a special budget for "significant purchase cases" (read:
new fighter jets)]{.underline}. New monies also should be put toward
personnel costs associated with the military's shift to an all-volunteer
force and, given the nature of the threat the PLA poses and the variety
of ways the PLA could coerce or use force against Taiwan, toward
fielding a mix of high-end and low-end capabilities. Among other
contingencies, [Taiwan's forces ideally should have at least a limited
capacity to respond rapidly to any infringement of the median line;
defend against cyber attacks; contest a naval or air blockade; control
airspace over the island and deny the PLA air supremacy in the event of
hostilities; withstand a decapitation campaign; prevent amphibious
landings on offshore islands and the main island; conduct a drawn-out
insurgency in the event of an invasion; carry out strike operations on
the mainland; and communicate, coordinate, and interoperate with the
U.S. military and those of other partner nations.]{.underline}

### ROC international isolation adv CP 

#### ROC should engage international organizations and countries to end isolation

**Mazza, 18**

\[Michael, research fellow, foreign & defense policy, at the American
Enterprise Institute, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," The
American Interest, 6/28/18,
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/28/the-coming-crisis-in-the-taiwan-strait/>,
acc. 7/8/19, GDI-LBP\]

Taiwan's challenges are significant, but not insurmountable. Put simply,
i[t must counter Chinese efforts to isolate it; counter Chinese
psychological operations targeted at Taiwan's population; and enhance
its defensive capabilities and, thus, its ability to deter military
actions. For Taiwan, these three lines of effort should be mutually
reinforcing.]{.underline}

Particularly in light of the Vatican's seeming determination to
establish diplomatic ties with Beijing, it is difficult to see how
Taiwan could expand its stable of diplomatic allies, at least in the
near term. Even so, diplomatic relations are not the be-all and end-all
in determining, to use Taiwan's preferred jargon, a nation's
"international space." Nor is inclusion in international organizations,
though certainly Taipei will not give up on participating in ICAO, the
WHO, and others that matter to Taiwan's interests.

[Taiwan is deeply enmeshed in the global economy as a major trading
economy]{.underline} and an occupant of a key position in global supply
chains, notably in the high-tech space. [A further embrace of free
market principles could make the island into a major site for global
business]{.underline}. Were that to proceed, [countries like Germany,
France, and Canada might not maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei, but
they would prioritize the island's security and stability in the
Strait]{.underline} if the likes of Siemens, BNP Paribas, and Manulife
were deeply invested in Taiwan.

It is for this reason, in part, that Taiwan's New Southbound Policy,
which seeks to develop economic and cultural ties to countries in South
Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia, is so important. It would lessen
Taiwan's economic reliance on the mainland, while enhancing its own
value in the eyes of many countries where China exercises significant
influence.

[Taiwan can also think creatively about engaging in international
forums.]{.underline} [Its hosting of the first-ever Ketagalan Forum in
August 2017 and Yushan Forum in October 2017 is a step in this
direction.]{.underline} As Taiwan's answer to the Shangri-La Dialogue,
the dual forums focused, respectively, on Asia-Pacific security issues
and on connectivity with the countries included in the New Southbound
Policy. Former Vice President Dick Cheney delivered an address at the
former. Several former senior government officials from regional
countries---including former Vice Presidents and Foreign
Ministers---attended the Yushan Forum, along with prominent scholars.
Tsai Ing-wen addressed both conferences and met with participants, which
in the latter case included a current U.S. government official. [The
high-level participation is promising for future iterations of the
forums and for Taiwan's engagement with the broader region.]{.underline}

[Taipei could also consider how it can better use the international
organizations in which it does have membership to expand its
international space.]{.underline} For example, [with U.S. support or
perhaps with the United States in the lead, Taiwan might establish one
or more issue-specific "caucuses" within the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation grouping to coordinate approaches at annual
meetings.]{.underline} Doing so would allow Taiwan to engage more deeply
with a number of countries in a relatively non-provocative way.

Broadly speaking, [Taiwan should also continue to deepen its unofficial
relations wherever possible]{.underline}. The United States will remain
Taiwan's most important foreign partner, but countries like Japan,
Australia, and India may be willing to expand their dealings with Taipei
as Beijing increasingly infringes on their own interests. Quiet
cooperation on issues such as cyber security, disaster relief, and
democracy promotion is particularly promising.

[Expanding Taipei's international space in these ways can reverse the
island's increasing isolation and counter the perception,]{.underline}
which China seeks to promote among the island's population, that Taiwan
stands alone in the world.

### Multi-plank Reassurance CP 

#### US should reaffirm its commitments to Taiwan -- multiple actions 

**Mazza, 18**

\[Michael, research fellow, foreign & defense policy, at the American
Enterprise Institute, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," The
American Interest, 6/28/18,
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/28/the-coming-crisis-in-the-taiwan-strait/>,
acc. 7/8/19, GDI-LBP\]

Ironically, [it is a relatively straightforward affair to counter
Taiwan's international isolation within the bounds of the "One China"
policy. First, the United States should drop self-imposed limitations on
bilateral engagement. American and Taiwanese military officers and
civilian officials at all levels should be permitted to
meet---]{.underline}in both the United States and Taiwan. [The
militaries should exercise together in bilateral and multilateral
settings. When it comes to arms sales, Washington should treat Taiwan as
it does countries with which it has diplomatic ties. Sales should occur
with regularity rather than in bundles, and they should not be held
hostage to the U.S.-China diplomatic calendar.]{.underline} To its
credit, the Trump Administration has recently approved American
industrial participation in Taiwan's submarine program; [it should next
convey a willingness to sell Taiwan the platforms it requires to ensure
a favorable air balance in the Strait. For too long, Washington has been
hesitant to sell Taipei the defensive articles Taipei assesses it needs
most.]{.underline}

[It would be particularly valuable for the Trump Administration to
publicly affirm at a senior level that it is U.S. policy,]{.underline}
as described in the Taiwan Relations Act:

[to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than
peaceful means]{.underline}, including by boycotts or embargoes, [a
threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
grave concern to the United States;]{.underline}

[to provide Taiwan with arms]{.underline} of a defensive character; and

[to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to
force o]{.underline}r other forms of coercion t[hat would jeopardize the
security,]{.underline} or the social or economic system, [of the people
on Taiwan.]{.underline}

[The Administration should likewise affirm that it is committed
to,]{.underline} per the TRA, [making "available to Taiwan such defense
articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to
enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability."]{.underline}

### Increase engagement with ROC CP

#### Multi-prong approach to increase US interaction with Taiwan key to check back against Chinese aggressiveness 

**Schmitt, Director of the Program on American Citizenship and Resident
Scholar Strategic Studies, and Fly, writer for The American Interest,
2019**

(Gary J. and Jamie M., "The Taiwan Relations Act at 40: It's time to
deepen ties," The American Interest, 4/8/19,
<http://www.aei.org/publication/the-taiwan-relations-act-at-40-its-time-to-deepen-ties/>
accessed 7/4/19 GDI-JEM)

For these reasons, [Congress should use the opportunity presented by the
40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act to assess]{.underline} its
successes, failures, and the [changes that need to be made so that the
United States]{.underline} [can still fulfill its original intent to the
people of Taiwan.]{.underline} The broad and deep relationship with
Taipei that existed between 1949 and 1979 has narrowed. [Congress can
reinvigorate the spirit of the Act by pursuing a multi-pronged agenda
for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.]{.underline}

[First, as the United States encourages partners to pursue economic
decoupling from mainland China in sensitive sectors, it should also
initiate negotiations]{.underline} with Taipei **[on a U.S.-Taiwan free
trade agreement]{.underline}**. China's military buildup and its
provocative maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait tend to command the most
attention, but [Taiwanese economic dependence on the mainland is also a
significant national security challenge]{.underline}. [Deepening trade
and investment ties to the United States and other partners will be key
to Taiwan's continued independent existence]{.underline}, making it more
difficult for Beijing to utilize economic coercion to interfere in
domestic Taiwanese politics. Congress can encourage the Trump
Administration to accept the Tsai government's offer to resolve
longstanding irritants in the U.S.-Taiwan trade relationship and begin
negotiations on a free trade agreement as quickly as possible.

[Second]{.underline}, the Taiwan Relations Act states that Congress
intended to authorize "the continuation of commercial, cultural, and
other relations between the people of the United States and the people
on Taiwan." Yet while business and cultural ties have continued to
flourish, official interactions have become limited because of the
caution of Administrations of both American political parties. And while
Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have met with Taiwanese
officials, including the island's Presidents, on U.S. soil and in
Taipei, Executive Branch visits are overwhelmingly limited to
working-level officials. The rules governing these contacts are not a
matter of law but are set by State Department guidelines that can be
modified at any time. [Congress should direct the Trump Administration
to update those guidelines to ensure that **U.S. and Taiwanese officials
of all ranks**, including in the respective national security agencies
and militaries, **can meet to discuss issues of mutual
interest**.]{.underline} Congress should also consider making the
Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, our de facto embassy in
Taipei, a Senate-confirmed political position.

[Third, the United States should take the steps necessary to ensure that
the Taiwan Relations Act's declaration that "any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means" would be "of grave
concern to the United States" is addressed.]{.underline} Given China's
military buildup across from Taiwan and its now routine air, naval, and
missile deployments designed to bully Taiwan, the Pentagon should, [in
addition to **regularizing arms sales to Taiwan**, invite the
**Taiwanese military to participate in exercises to increase the
former's proficiency in combined arms**]{.underline} and to ensure that
the two forces are able to operate effectively together should the need
arise.

[Finally, Beijing has put Taipei under increasing pressure by closing
off its international space]{.underline}. It has attempted to poach
Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies and has used its growing clout in
many international organizations to block the more than 23 million
Taiwanese from being represented in international organizations on
issues such as health, law enforcement, and civil aviation. **[Congress
should ensure that U.S. partners and allies understand that promoting
ties and cooperation with Taiwan is a priority for U.S.
policy,]{.underline}** a priority that will be considered when
Washington assesses annual assistance budgets.

## Condition and Consult CP

**Arms sale reductions should be coupled with assurances of restrictions
on Chinese military industrial power and involve consultation with
Taiwan and Japan**

**Swaine, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 2015**

Need for a Stable U.S.-China Balance of Power," Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, 4/20/15,

GDI-JEM)

In the case of Taiwan, [any credible neutralization of the cross-strait
issue as a threat to either side's interests would require,]{.underline}
as a first step, [**a U.S.-China understanding regarding restrictions on
U.S. arms sales** in return for certain types of verifiable limits on
Chinese military production]{.underline} and deployments relevant to the
island, such as ballistic missiles and strike aircraft[. Beijing would
also likely need to provide credible assurances that it would not use
force against Taiwan in any conceivable contingency]{.underline} short
of an outright Taiwanese declaration of de jure independence or the U.S.
placement of forces on the island. In the past, Beijing has resisted
providing assurances regarding any non-use of force toward the island,
viewing such an assurance as a limit on Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.
However, [as in the case of Korea, Beijing would likely view such a
conditional limitation on its right to employ force as acceptable if
viewed as a requirement for the creation of an overall stable balance of
power]{.underline} in the Western Pacific; Chinese leaders might also
regard it as a step toward the eventual unification of the island with
the mainland. In addition, [Beijing would also likely need to accept: a)
explicitly that such unification could only occur on the basis of a
peaceful process involving the willing consent of the people of Taiwan,
and b) tacitly that eventual unification would likely not
occur]{.underline}, if at all, [for many decades]{.underline}. For its
part, the United States would likely need to provide assurances to China
that it would neither place forces on the island nor provide any new
level of defense assistance to Taipei, as long as Beijing abides by its
own assurances. And [both countries would need to consult closely with
Taiwan and Japan at each step of this process]{.underline} and provide
clear and credible assurances regarding the understanding reached
between them.

Taiwan is not an instrument in a great game. Nor is Taiwan an American
card that can be traded away to attain favor with Beijing. [Taiwan is of
intrinsic value to the United States simply because of its existence,
historical significance, and contributions to the international
community.]{.underline}

[The PRC can be expected to increase reliance on coercive persuasion and
accelerate its isolation of Taiwan internationally.]{.underline}
Reflecting a Cold War mentality, Beijing\'s intransigence in recognizing
Taiwan's political legitimacy remains one of the most significant
obstacles to regional peace and stability.

As its pressure increases, [**the U.S. should consider expanding
interactions with the Taiwan** within the framework of our existing U.S.
One China policy. Greater balance in U.S. cross-Strait policy could help
create conditions, without playing a mediating role, for resumption of
cross-Strait negotiations]{.underline} on terms acceptable to both
sides. The onus is on Beijing, and others in the international
community, to conceive of some alternative that would be acceptable to
people on Taiwan and mindful of Taiwan\'s popular sovereignty. [How
authorities in Beijing manage their political differences with Taiwan is
perhaps the most important barometer of Chinese intentions in the
Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}. As long as it remains strong,
confident, and economically viable[, Taiwan is uniquely positioned to
influence the peaceful emergence of China as a responsible member of the
international community]{.underline}. [The U.S. should actively
encourage Beijing to engage counterparts on Taiwan]{.underline} without
preconditions and renounce use of force to resolve differences.

## Advantage CPs -- US Relations

## Advantage CPs -- Enhanced ROC Deterrence 

### Reserve Force Restructuring 

#### Solvency -- reserve force restructuring to deter China 

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka, et al Center for Policy Studies, 2018**

(Michael A. Hunzeker and Alexander Lanoszka "A QUESTION OF
TIME:Enhancing Taiwan's Conventional Deterrence Posture" Center for
Policy Studies NOVEMBER 2018 <http://csps.gmu.edu/a-question-of-time/>
accessed GDI-TM)

The fourth and final denial zone is society itself. [Neither threats nor
military violence can compel Taiwan as long as a large enough fraction
of its people is willing to resist. This point holds true even in a
worst-case invasion scenario. Indeed, the prospect of waging a
years-long counterinsurgency could well serve as the ultimate form of
conventional deterrence.]{.underline}11

What [policymakers must realize is that insurgencies are not
spontaneous]{.underline}. [They cannot assume that popular resistance
will automatically emerge in the aftermath of an
invasion]{.underline}.12 [Conducting hit and run ambushes on
conventional troops is inherently risky, and not just anyone can (or
should) attempt to these kinds of combat missions.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [engaging in such attacks effectively requires specialized
training]{.underline}. Because Taiwan is an island located less than 100
miles away from its most likely attacker, insurgents may well have to
fight for months---or longer---without external logistical and financial
support of the type that insurgent movements elsewhere in the world take
for granted due to porous land borders. [Most importantly, since the
goal is to deter an invasion, rather than to fight one,Taiwan must
credibly signal that its people can and will wage a brutal insurgency
under the harshest conditions imaginable.]{.underline}

To [signal that Taiwan's citizens possess both the resolve and the
capability to wage an insurgency, Taiwan should consider turning its
Reserve Command into a Territorial Defense
Force.]{.underline}Currently,Taiwan has approximately 2.5 million
reservists. Divided into four tiers of readiness, [existing defense
strategies call for these reservists to largely augment, reinforce, and
support active units, or perform a wide range of disaster response, rear
area security, and infrastructure protection missions.]{.underline}

Instead, [we recommend placing the most capable and mission-ready
reserve units under the administrative and operational control of the
active duty units they will support in wartime.The rest of the existing
Reserve Command should be rebranded as the Territorial Defense
Force]{.underline}. Nor should this change be cosmetic. [Territorial
Defense Forces should be organized and trained to fight specifically to
conduct guerrilla attacks on an invader]{.underline}. We prescribe the
following:

• [Territorial Defense soldiers should be assigned to units such that
they fight where they live.]{.underline}

• [Territorial Defense armories should be accordingly divided and
scattered]{.underline} throughout the country to both give them [easy
access to their weapons and ammunition at the first warning signs of an
invasion]{.underline}. [This approach also has the added benefit of
complicating Chinese targeting]{.underline} such that it would be a
waste of limited long range precision weapons, advanced strike aircraft
sorties, and sabotage units to try to preemptively eliminate even a
fraction of these armories.

• [Territorial Defense soldiers should be organized, trained, and
equipped and organized to conduct autonomous, small-unit hit and run
strikes.]{.underline} Every unit should have personnel trained to handle
first aid, demolitions, and communications. The last ability may prove
important for recording and broadcasting atrocities committed by
invaders via satellite links.

### UMT -- solvency 

#### Universal military training assist in enhancing deterrence 

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka, et al Center for Policy Studies, 2018**

[Since the current pool of 2.5 million reservists will continue to
shrink as Taiwan shifts away from conscription]{.underline}, the
government might also want to [consider introducing Universal Military
Training (UMT)]{.underline}. Like conscription[, UMT would require that
every military-age citizen]{.underline} (male and perhaps female)
[receive a limited amount of military training]{.underline}. This
training could take the form of an intense three- or four-month block
after high school, but it could also be structured as a required college
course akin to the U.S. reserve officer training corps. Unlike
conscription, [UMT does not require that every military-age citizen
serve on active duty after completing his or her training]{.underline}.
Instead, [UMT graduates would transition directly into the Territorial
Defense Force]{.underline} and be subject to annual training and wartime
mobilization for a set period of time. In this way, [UMT can focus
specifically on fostering the mindset, skills and tactics, techniques,
and procedures unique to guerrilla warfare]{.underline}. UMT has another
advantage: [to the degree that Taiwan's citizens believe that the
training is rigorous and useful, UMT will likely increase the degree to
which they identify with Taiwan and its defense]{.underline}. We discuss
this idea in Chapter 6.

One, like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, [it is futile for the United
States to try to write China out of Asia's story. And this would be true
of any China]{.underline}, not just Xi Jinping's assertive and
nationalistic China.

[One reason for this is cartographic: China borders every sub-region of
Asia---Northeast, Southeast, Central, and South. The United States does
not. Neither does any other big Asian player.]{.underline}

[Another reason is financial:]{.underline} even if China cannot
ultimately deploy the billions of state-backed project finance it has
pledged to the Belt and Road, [it can still drop plenty of meaningful
money into countries all over Asia where the United States and its firms
are largely invisible. To reject and battle against every instance of
China's effort to foster connectivity, then, would require Washington to
fight both geographic and economic gravity.]{.underline}

[A more realistic way to counterbalance the spread of Chinese
power,]{.underline} especially in Asia, [is to be more successful at
bolstering America's own power, presence, initiative, role,
relationships, and arsenal of military, economic, and technological
tools. And it can best do this in concert with other partners who have
stepped into the vacuum created by US absence, disinterest,
protectionism, and worse.]{.underline}

That is why the recent Trump Administration effort to coordinate
infrastructure priorities among the US and Japan and the US, Japan, and
India is so welcome. So, too, is a development finance reform bill
making its way through Capitol Hill, which aims to make it easier for US
firms to manage and mitigate risk in tough business environments.

To compete in geopolitics---as in sports, business, and life---one needs
to actually compete. [Washington has to outperform the Chinese
competition, not just belittle and whine about it.]{.underline}

[There is certainly a deep suspicion of Chinese intent across Asia
today]{.underline}. But I have seen enough from every sub-region of Asia
to know that the [US will not get far by telling third countries that
they should forestall deepening their economic relationships with China.
For nearly every country, and especially the smaller ones, that is an
impractical choice, and therefore will be rejected.]{.underline}

And that is not all. [Trashing China's initiatives while failing to
counter and compete with them signals other capitals that their
countries are of little interest to the United States on their own
terms. Their takeaway will surely be that the United States pays
attention to them only in the context of its strategic competition with
China. That is a poor message indeed.]{.underline}

#### Economic engagement by the US challenges China proactively, more chance for success

I have written elsewhere about how the [US could be more proactive in
Asia, not reactive. But in responding to BRI, at least, it's important
when designing US policies not to compare American apples to Chinese
oranges. America isn't China. For instance, it doesn't have state-backed
firms that it can leverage through billions channeled through
state-backed policy banks.]{.underline}

[So Washington should be better leveraging its uniquely American
strengths---technology, innovation ecosystems, STEM education,
connections to the global capital markets, best in class services and
other firms, and so on.]{.underline}

[It will be harder to deploy that leverage in the context of messages
that say "America First."]{.underline} American business remains
crucial, especially in East Asia. US companies have invested more than
\$200 billion into the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia alone. But
what is at stake is not just business but rules, norms, standards, and
strategic momentum.

[Ultimately, at the political level, Washington spends far too much time
playing defense against Beijing. As Asia becomes more integrated, the US
will become progressively less relevant in many parts of the region---in
Central Asia, in most of South Asia except India, and in mainland
Southeast Asia, as noted above.]{.underline}

Within a generation, Americans could find their firms at a competitive
disadvantage in a part of the world that will constitute as much as half
of the global economy. Americans could become bystanders to the economic
and strategic dynamics quickly reshaping this region.

[The fact is, China is going to continue proposing initiatives like the
Belt and Road. So the US needs to get off its back foot and onto the
initiative.]{.underline}

[The US can work with China but that needs to happen in the broader
context of strategy and policy in Asia. And this includes leveraging the
many initiatives and partnerships from Japan to Singapore that should
also aim to promote economic expansion and connectivity.]{.underline}

I wrote in 2016---and I still believe---that [the best adaptation to
China's new activism is a stronger offense, not perpetual
defense.]{.underline}
