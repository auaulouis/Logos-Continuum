You know the Trump administration's efforts to salvage its approach
toward Saudi Arabia are in trouble when Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the
president's closest allies, threatens to shut down all Senate business
over what he deems as a "not acceptable" response that has him "pissed."
And it might get worse this weekend if President Donald Trump, as is his
wont, ignores his advisors' warnings and warmly embraces Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the man who most likely gave the order to
murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi, at the G-20 summit in Argentina. The
Trump administration seems determined to stick with the erratic crown
prince no matter what, arguing that oil and money are more important
than protecting U.S. values. But despite Trump's wishes, it's clear that
it will be much harder, if not impossible, for Saudi Arabia to gain
support for arms sales or any other kind of assistance that requires
approval from the U.S. Congress. Finally, the crown prince will remain
politically radioactive---there is little chance he could make a
high-profile trip to the United States to be feted by the likes of Oprah
and Mark Zuckerberg anytime soon. Yet in the long term, perhaps
[the]{.underline} only [silver lining of]{.underline} [this crisis is it
is forcing the United States to reassess the fundamental rationale of
the relationship with Saudi Arabia]{.underline} in a way it hasn't since
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, or, before that, the 1973 oil
shock. A common refrain in Congress has been that there should be no
more "business as usual." So what should the new business look like? [It
is tempting to file for a divorce]{.underline}, just as Trump has gone
all in on a full embrace. [Yet that would be unwise]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [the United States must offer]{.underline} Saudi
Arabia's [leaders a choice]{.underline}: [They]{.underline} [visibly
shift to policies defined by "three
noes]{.underline}"---[no]{.underline} [further intervention in
Yemen]{.underline}, [no more fighting with Qatar]{.underline}, [and no
more surprises]{.underline}---[or]{.underline} [face a significant
downgrade of the relationship]{.underline}. Trump has already decided.
Yet his exclamation point-filled statement proclaiming the essentiality
of the relationship got it backward: The United States matters much more
to Saudi Arabia than Saudi Arabia does to the United States. The
administration claims it needs Saudi Arabia in order to counter Iran.
But [it is Saudi Arabia that needs the United States]{.underline}, [not
the other way around]{.underline}. [The United States is a global
superpower]{.underline} [that can cope with a]{.underline} threat by a
[country]{.underline} halfway around the world [with a GDP]{.underline}
[similar in size to Maryland's]{.underline}. For Saudi Arabia, Iran is a
country three times its size right across the water with a long history
of strategic competition. So, who needs whom more? Then there is the
economic relationship. There's no need to shelve American values and
bend to Saudi requests because of their oil reserves. They're not going
to stop selling oil if Washington drops its patronage of Riyadh. It's in
their interest to sell oil, and the United States is better insulated
from fluctuations in the energy markets than it has ever been. If the
United States needed Saudi Arabia that desperately, then Trump would
certainly not be picking trade fights with China and the European Union,
whose impact on the U.S. economy dwarf that of Saudi Arabia. Of course,
Saudi money can be good for the U.S. economy and helps the U.S. defense
industry. But it is not uniquely vital. One can only speculate why Trump
sticks to his mistaken assumptions---maybe it is his personal financial
interests, or his contrarian instincts, or the fact that most of his
views on geopolitics seem stuck in the 1970s and '80s, or simply because
the House of Saud's gilded, autocratic patriarchy feels very familiar to
the House of Trump. Whatever the reason, the green-light policy has
proved to be a failure. The United States has not ended up with a close
partner in the Middle East but with a rogue ally drawing America into
unnecessary quagmires and hurting its interests. The question is what to
do about it. It might feel good for the United States to turn its back
on the Saudis, but that won't enhance U.S. interests or save lives. [The
United States has leverage it must use,]{.underline} but that has to be
carefully estimated. Moreover, there is some truth to the argument that
Saudi cooperation on counterterrorism, countering Iran, managing oil
prices, and investing in the U.S. economy are important benefits, even
if they do not matter as much as Trump thinks they do. Instead, the
United States has to offer the "three noes" deal. It starts with no
surprises. The message should be clear: [Washington]{.underline}
welcomes the fact that Saudi Arabia is willing to take on more
responsibility for its own security, but it [needs to be consulted on
big strategic initiatives]{.underline}, [especially]{.underline} those
[that implicate U.S. interests]{.underline}. [This would]{.underline}
[mean]{.underline} that, going forward, the [rash
decision-making]{.underline} of the past two years [that has been so
harmful to]{.underline} both [Saudi and U.S. interests would
stop]{.underline}. Part of this deal must also include Saudi shifts on
two issues: no more fighting with Qatar and no escalation of the war in
Yemen. On Qatar, the Saudis should be pressed to walk back the
unrealistic "13 demands" they, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and
Bahrain have put to Qatar to a much more manageable set of requests.
This is what the United States has tried to do in its mediation efforts
over the past year, but [now it must be made]{.underline} absolutely
[clear to the Saudis]{.underline} that the [United States expects more
from]{.underline} them [if the relationship is to remain
unaffected]{.underline}. On Yemen, [Washington should demand Saudi
leaders]{.underline} urgently [work toward a political
solution]{.underline}. [On Yemen]{.underline}, Washington should demand
Saudi leaders urgently work toward a political solution. This seemed to
be where Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo were heading before Trump pulled the rug out from under them. Now
that the U.S. Senate has voted to take a step closer to cut off support
for the Saudi campaign---something the Democratic-controlled House will
take up next year---the administration must use this to press Riyadh to
agree to an immediate cease-fire and ensuring humanitarian access to the
port of Hodeidah, through which most of Yemen's imports flow. This could
come with a carrot: The Saudis should review with the U.S. Defense
Department in detail their battle plans, doctrine, and strategy,
allowing American military officers to have a seat at the table with
them and taking advice on fundamentally shifting the approach to one
more in line with U.S. values. This would also make the Saudi fight more
effective. [In exchange for a willingness by the Saudis to shift their
approach]{.underline}, [the United States would commit to maintaining
military support]{.underline}. Here's where leverage comes in. [The
United States must also make clear what happens if Saudi Arabia does not
accept this offer]{.underline}. This is not simply about arms sales,
which the Saudis care about but not enough to change their behavior, and
the U.S. defense industry can live without (although it would
understandably prefer not to make this choice). [If Saudi Arabia is
going to be an erratic,]{.underline} unpredictable partner, [the United
States doesn't want to be as closely tied to them.]{.underline} This
would mean scaling back goals regarding Saudi Arabia. It would mean less
military cooperation and more modest economic relations. It would mean
fewer higher-level visits to kowtow to them. It would also mean less
strategic ambition. For years the United States has worked to promote
stronger regional cooperation with Riyadh at the center---it was a
worthy goal, and both of us were part of these efforts during the Obama
administration. Yet without a change in behavior, this has to be set
aside while continuing to invest in partners like the UAE, Qatar, and
Israel. In this sense, the U.S. approach toward Saudi Arabia would be
akin to the relationships with Egypt, Pakistan, and even
Turkey---important security relationships, but deeply troubled ones.
Trump is unlikely to take this opportunity. But what members of Congress
of both parties---and 2020 presidential aspirants---must do is make
clear that Trump's green-light policy will not be around forever, and
paint a picture of what the new "business as usual" will be. [It should
be the Saudis, not Americans, who will have to choose]{.underline}. The
choice is simple: [Work with the United States in genuine responsible
partnership]{.underline}, and together, American and Saudi interests can
prosper[. Or continue their current approach---in which case, the United
States will be fine without them.]{.underline}

### 2NC O/V

#### The key question of the counterplan is weather any part of the US-Saudi relationship are worth preserving\-\--the aff is a moratorium on cooperation\-\--only the counterplan coerces saudi arabia without cutting them free

Both the Obama and Trump administrations watched as the kingdom\'s
policies became more assertive, leading to the widely held assumption
that America can\'t change the Saudi calculus. But this is far from the
truth. As the Saudis\' chief political and military partner and the
undisputed security guarantor in the Middle East, the United States has
considerable influence it can wield over Saudi decisionmaking. It has
thus far gone virtually unused. In reality, the United States may have
more leverage over Saudi Arabia today than at any other time except
during the 1991 Gulf War. [Trump\'s ascension]{.underline} to the U.S.
presidency helped [alleviate]{.underline} some of [Saudi Arabia\'s
concerns]{.underline} that stemmed from President Obama\'s Middle East
policies [and]{.underline}, consequently, [afforded the United States
more influence over the kingdom.]{.underline} The Saudis had grown
distrustful of U.S. commitment to the region due to President Obama\'s
plans to pivot to Asia and his administration\'s response to the Arab
Spring and pursuit of a nuclear deal with Tehran. But President Trump
made Riyadh the destination of his first foreign trip in office and
pledged to support the kingdom while harshly criticizing its archenemy,
Iran, and withdrawing from the nuclear deal this past May. At the same
time, Saudi Arabia has become more reliant on the United States than
when President Obama was in office. [Riyadh\'s contentious
policies---like]{.underline} the [war in Yemen and the]{.underline}
[rift with its neighbors]{.underline}---[have constrained its options
and inadvertently reinforced Saudi Arabia\'s need]{.underline} [for U.S.
military and political support]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
[security cooperation and intelligence sharing]{.underline}. Prince
Mohammed\'s legacy and perhaps even power is presently tied to two
initiatives: The Yemen war and Vision 2030---an ambitious program of
social and economic reforms that Riyadh plans to institute to diversify
its economy. Neither objective is apparently proceeding as the crown
prince had hoped. And to succeed, they will likely require continued
U.S. support. Until recently, President Trump was not inclined to use
these developments as leverage. Instead, he stood by the crown prince
even as U.S. military support to Saudi forces in Yemen---including
aerial refueling and advising on intelligence sharing and targeting
procedures---have come under attack in Congress and by international
rights groups. Some have argued that the administration has emboldened
Riyadh, giving it carte blanche to pursue its more assertive policies.
New details pertaining to Khashoggi\'s murder have emerged, ostensibly
tying the young Saudi monarch to the incident and leading to mounting
congressional pressure. But the Trump administration has been willing to
give the Saudis only a mere slap on the wrist without fundamentally
altering the dynamics of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. [The Trump
administration is unlikely to end]{.underline} its [support]{.underline}
[for Saudi regional efforts]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [radically
change its approach]{.underline}. But [it could consider using its
influence to encourage]{.underline} the [Saudi leadership]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [moderate its assertive and damaging
policies]{.underline} abroad. [Rather than providing its assistance
freely]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia, [Washington could utilize it to
extract]{.underline} [concessions]{.underline} from the Saudi leadership
to alter its behavior. [Making U.S. support conditional to initiatives
tied]{.underline} [to]{.underline} Prince [Mohammed\'s]{.underline}
[success provides Washington with]{.underline} a [degree of sway over
the brash monarc]{.underline}h, [who]{.underline} increasingly [needs to
produce a "win" in]{.underline} [light]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the
[reputational harm]{.underline} the Khashoggi affair has done to the
kingdom, his legacy and perhaps even his hold on power. This approach is
not without risk---the Saudi government could, for example, reduce
intelligence sharing, or switch off the proverbial oil tap, like the
OPEC states did in 1973. But 2018 is not 1973, and the United States is
no longer as reliant on Saudi oil. More so, the Saudi government\'s
assertive actions also pose operational and reputational risks to
important U.S. interests, as the Khashoggi affair demonstrated, and
therefore [the benefits of this approach are likely to outweigh any
costs]{.underline} [Riyadh]{.underline} [may seek to
impose.]{.underline} On the surface, [making U.S. support provisory may
appear]{.underline} to be an [unpalatable]{.underline} approach, one
that legitimizes the crown prince. But wielded correctly, [the White
House can use this leverage]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[recalibrate]{.underline} [the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Blanket support
need not be granted in a way that emboldens]{.underline} [Saudi
behavior]{.underline}, leading to actions that are
[damaging]{.underline} to [U.S. interests]{.underline}. Instead, [the
administration could consider]{.underline} also [making conditional its
support for the Saudi government\'s]{.underline} [priority
programs]{.underline} with the goal of altering and shaping its
behavior. This includes making the Saudis take responsibility for
Khashoggi\'s brutal death, putting an end to indiscriminate targeting
practices in Yemen, altering the government\'s harsh response to
opposition inside and outside of the Kingdom, and ending the rift with
Qatar. Naysayers of such an approach might claim that it only deepens
the transactionalism on which the U.S.-Saudi relationship is presently
based. But it is worth recognizing that [the partnership was founded on
an explicit alignment of interests]{.underline}, not values. [By
acknowledging this, the United States would be better
positioned]{.underline} [to adopt]{.underline} an [approach that best
serves its own interests]{.underline}. At this point, the Saudi
government needs U.S. support more than the White House needs Saudi
Arabia.

[Sales]{.underline} [of]{.underline} air-delivered precision-guided
munitions ([PGMs]{.underline}) [are another lightning rod issue in the
bilateral security]{.underline} [relationship]{.underline}. Following
the 2009-2010 round of hostilities with the Houthis, the kingdom sought
to refresh its stock of antipersonnel bombs with a large order of 1,300
U.S.-built CBU-105 sensor-fused weapons (a higher-reliability
submunition that manufacturers say does not qualify as a cluster bomb
due to its low malfunction rate). Yet by November 2015, eight months
into the current war, the Saudis had used up nearly 2,600 PGMs,
according to strike metrics compiled by The Washington Institute. In
response, the Saudis requested a \$1.29 billion package comprising
around 19,000 air-delivered PGMs, an order that began delivery in July
2017. In addition to that package, the Senate narrowly approved a new
\$500 million commercial sale of PGMs to Riyadh in June 2017---the first
installment in a mammoth \$4.46 billion series of air-launched munition
deals that would provide the Saudis with 104,000 U.S. PGMs in the next
half decade. Riyadh may be accelerating its purchases in anticipation of
a prolonged war in Yemen and the potential loss of U.S. sales down the
road. According to Washington Institute data collected in Saudi Arabia
and Yemen, [the kingdom's forces have used around 14,500 munitions since
March 2015,]{.underline} [almost all PGMs]{.underline},
[with]{.underline} the [average rate gradually declining from 333
PGMs]{.underline} per month in 2015 [to 270 per month this
year]{.underline}. The U.S. munitions currently arriving in Saudi Arabia
were ordered in November 2015, when Riyadh recognized it might need new
PGMs by 2019, but the intervening years have seen few signs of a PGM
shortfall. Based on a rough sense of prewar stocks and a constant
dribble of replacements, Riyadh could probably keep bombing at its
current rate for several years even if all new U.S. PGM deals were
rejected. Thus[, while cutting off such sales may be a good way to
signal]{.underline} U[.S. displeasure]{.underline} or publicly distance
Washington from the war, [the data indicates]{.underline} that [it would
not meaningfully slow the air campaign anytime soon.]{.underline}
ADJUSTING U.S. SALES With U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's
deadliest civilian fatality incidents, Congress has ample rationale to
block, delay, or condition future arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Depending
on the results of this week's election, the Senate's cross-party,
forty-seven-seat opposition to such sales could become a majority. Saudi
intransigence on the Khashoggi case or Yemen peace talks could also flip
more senators into supporting a joint resolution against new weapons
packages. In all likelihood, the president would veto any such
resolution unless Congress can show that it has carefully weighed the
costs---in terms of both neglecting the legitimate security needs of a
long-term partner and harming America's status as a security ally and
arms vendor. To address these concerns, the U.S. government should apply
some common-sense guidelines: Think ahead and review the details of arms
sales[.]{.underline} [Under]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration's watch, [Saudi Arabia gained far greater military
capabilities and was empowered to]{.underline} act in [pursuit of its
own security]{.underline}. The lack of a detailed, forward-looking,
top-to-bottom review of U.S. arms sales to Riyadh concealed this
reality. Prior to considering new sales, then, Congress should insist
that the State Department and Pentagon provide an in-depth, holistic
assessment of the kingdom's military capabilities, security sector
organization, future plans, related purchase needs, and alternative
suppliers, outlining the implications that these findings hold for U.S.
security. Arms sales should be driven by a clear-eyed, long-term
assessment of U.S. strategic interests, not by simple economic
opportunism or the self-defined priorities of Saudi leaders. Do not deny
systems that are mostly defensive in nature. Some Saudi capabilities
represent welcome burden-sharing with U.S. forces in defending the
Persian Gulf region and containing Iran. Washington's desire to hold
Saudi leaders accountable for problematic actions is understandable, but
it should not be used to craft policies that reward Tehran. The United
States has a strong strategic interest in continuing to provide naval
systems, missile defenses (including THAAD), and support for border
defense and force protection (e.g., counter-mine and counter-indirect
fire systems). These systems represent 54 percent (or \$26.5 billion) of
the \$48.81 billion in Saudi arms sales proposed by the Trump
administration to date, and a sizable prize for the U.S. economy.
[Condition and slow the provision of mostly offensive systems.
As]{.underline} described above, [the kingdom could use certain
systems]{.underline} [to take the war deeper into Yemen,]{.underline}
[including]{.underline} M1A2S [tanks]{.underline}, self-propelled
[artillery]{.underline}, [and PGMs]{.underline}. Delaying or
[conditioning their delivery is therefore justifiable]{.underline},
[perhaps]{.underline} [with]{.underline} a [proviso that they not be
deployed in Yemen unless]{.underline} the [Houthis prove unwilling to
engage in peace talks]{.underline}. Washington could also tie sales to a
halt in high-risk urban strikes, as Secretary Pompeo suggested on
October 30.

### 2NC Solves Iran

#### Saudi Arabia is a key deterrent to Iran\-\--this is a independent net benefit to the counterplan 

**Rosenfield 12** (daniel k, Director for Taiwan at Pentagon, US
Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy
Institute for Defense Analyses, Elliott School of International Affair,
ida paper p-4835 march 2012 countering iran with arms sales to the gulf
cooperation council states//ng

Despite these concerns, there are a number of compelling reasons to sell
major offensive weapons to the GCC states. First, major offensive
weapons permit the GCC states to retaliate strongly against Iran for any
instance of low-level aggression, be it terrorism, subversion, or
limited military strikes. For example, laser- and global positioning
system (GPS)-guided bombs allow for precision strikes on Iran's vital
import and export facilities in the Gulf, while more powerful
counter-air and counter-air-defense systems will help pave the way for
such attacks. Second, [if Iran chooses to counter-retaliate strongly
against the GCC states]{.underline}, major [offensive weapons will help
these states]{.underline} [limit]{.underline} the [damage]{.underline}
[they]{.underline} will [incur while also imposing additional costs on
Iran]{.underline} for its decision to counter-retaliate, ideally
convincing Iran that further escalation would not be in its interest. In
other words[, major offensive weapons support the escalation dominance
of the GCC states over Iran]{.underline}. As Michael Knights, a Fellow
at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a specialist in
Gulf military affairs, states, [Fostered by bilateral planning
assistance]{.underline} [from the United States]{.underline} via the
Gulf Security Dialogue, GCC [militaries are making rapid advances and
may eclipse Iranian capabilities]{.underline} in the Gulf within ten
years. By 2015, for instance, the combined forces of the UAE military
will likely be able to prevent Iranian naval operations in UAE
territorial waters and EEZs \[Exclusive Economic Zones\], seize and hold
Iranian-held islands, and intercept some Iranian missile and air attacks
on the UAE in the event of a conflict.50 [Moreover]{.underline},
"encouraging signs suggest that the GCC states will \[by 2015\] be able
to maintain local air superiority over their national territories and
EEZs..."51 Likewise, Anthony Cordesman has said that major arms sales
proposed by the United States "can help create a Saudi Air Force that is
more of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi
Arabia..."52 If the GCC states are thought to have escalation dominance
over Iran, the effect should be to reduce Iran's ability to deter
retaliation for its low-level aggression, thus limiting its freedom to
commit such aggression in the first place. A third reason to sell major
offensive weapons to the GCC states is that [defensive weapons alone
will not likely prove adequate to countering more intense low-level
aggression]{.underline} [by]{.underline} a nuclear-armed
[Iran]{.underline}. No system of defenses can be perfect, and without
some fear of counterattack, an aggressor might have little reason not to
repeatedly test the defenses arrayed against him. There is also a matter
of cost-effectiveness: deterrence by the threat of punishing an attacker
can make it far less costly to secure valuable targets spread over large
geographic areas. For the GCC states, trying to defend both
simultaneously and effectively all possible coastal and inland targets
of low-level attack by Iran could well be cost-prohibitive. A fourth
reason to sell major offensive weapons is that some of the [weapons
allow for retaliation against Iran in ways that could
minimize]{.underline} the risk of [further escalation]{.underline}. For
instance, the sale of Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles to Saudi
Arabia and the UAE will allow these states to attack Iran's vital
economic facilities in the Gulf without sending large formations of
fighter, attack, and defense-suppression aircraft to potentially do
battle with the Iranian air force. In fact, it appears Storm Shadow
missiles could be launched from over Saudi or UAE territory and still
damage vital facilities in Iran. 53 The sale of U.S. ATACMS T2K Unitary
missiles to Bahrain and the UAE would offer a similar capacity for
limited, standoff attacks. ATACMS is an artillery system with a range of
270 or 300 kilometers, GPS-assisted guidance, and a 550-pound
high-explosive blast/fragmentation warhead.54 If based in the UAE,
ATACMS could strike the Iranian port of Bandar-e-Abbas, which handles
some 90 percent of all containerized shipping traffic in Iran. 55
Similarly, ATACMS deployed to the eastern tip of Bahrain would threaten
Iran's second-largest oil export terminal, that on Lavan Island. As with
Storm Shadow, ATACMS would not require the GCC states to contest Iran
for local air superiority, something that would tend to increase the
risk of further escalation toward major war. Also, to the extent Iran or
the GCC states perceive the risk of further escalation resulting from
the use of Storm Shadow or ATACMS to be low, the weapons can be seen as
more usable and thus can provide stronger deterrence as well as
escalation control. A fifth reason to sell major offensive weapons to
the GCC states is that doing so will make it easier for the United
States to defend the region's crucial energy suppliers from large-scale
attack. [Capabilities useful in countering low-level aggression---for
instance]{.underline}, major offensive weapons---[are of course also
relevant to deterrence]{.underline} [and]{.underline} defeat of
[large-scale attack by Iran.]{.underline} [The sale of such weapons to
the GCC states]{.underline} thereby [helps to alleviate U.S. defense
planning requirements in the Gulf]{.underline} and the budgets they
absorb. This rationale has become especially important in recent years
as the United States has sought to rebalance its strategic focus with
more weight given to Asia while grappling with serious financial
challenges at home. Sixth, the process of empowering the GCC states
could also help to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons and
convince it to accept strong international controls on its nuclear
program. Iran has to consider that nuclear weapons are not a security
panacea. While they are considered very useful in deterring threats to
vital interests, their deterrent value is seen to diminish with the
importance of the interest at stake. Hence, a key question for Iran is
whether a small nuclear force, in the absence of relatively strong
nonnuclear military capabilities, would provide enough deterrence to
permit low-level aggression on a greater scale than is safely possible
today. There is a risk it would not. While there has been no definitive
U.S. policy statement on the matter to date, the GCC states are
nonetheless understood to enjoy the backing of U.S. nuclear and
conventional forces, including missile defenses and preemptive strike
capabilities. 56 If [these states build up their conventional power to
eclipse Iran's]{.underline} nonnuclear [military power in the Gulf,
Iran's freedom to commit low-level]{.underline} aggression [could
diminish in net terms even after acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
It is perhaps for this reason that in a September 7, 2009 interview with
Al Jazeera, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated the
following: ...one of the pathways to get the Iranians to change their
approach on the nuclear issue is to persuade them that moving down that
path will actually jeopardize their security, not enhance it. So the
more that our Arab friends and allies can strengthen their security
capabilities, the more they can strengthen their cooperation, both with
each other and with us. I think [this sends the signal to the Iranians
that this path they're on is not going to advance Iranian
security]{.underline} [but]{.underline} in fact could [weaken
it.]{.underline}57 Granted, precisely how the GCC states will react to
more intense low-level aggression by a nuclear-armed Iran cannot be
known at this time. Even with superior nonnuclear forces, these states
might still prefer to submit to stronger Iranian demands of them,
choosing appeasement rather than counterattacking and risking major war
with a nuclear-armed power. Nevertheless, [Iran's leaders will
understand]{.underline} that the [GCC states are now spending
significant sums on acquiring major offensive weapons]{.underline}. They
can draw several lessons from this. First, given their timing,
large-scale purchases of major offensive weapons by the GCC states are
difficult to explain absent the need to retaliate for Iran's low-level
aggression and dominate any ensuing contest in non-nuclear escalation.
Therefore, [such purchases are a sign that the GCC]{.underline} states
have the political will to resist an expansion of Iran's influence in
the region. Second, major offensive weapons give GCC states the option
of effective resistance, whether or not they choose to exercise that
option. This fact alone increases the risk for Iran as its weighs the
potential nearand long-term costs and benefits of its nuclear posture.
Third, if in the future a nuclear-armed Iran chooses to intensify its
low-level aggression, the GCC states will have many billions of dollars
of "sunk costs" in the form of strike fighters, missiles, guided bombs
and the like, strengthening arguments for the use of these weapons.
Taken together, these factors underscore the risk apparently referred to
by then-Secretary Gates: that [Iran's current nuclear policies will
ultimately make the country worse off in terms of its power and
security.]{.underline} A final reason to sell major offensive
[weapons]{.underline} [to the GCC states is that the
weapons]{.underline} [can substitute for direct U.S. action to counter
low-level aggression by]{.underline} a nuclear-armed [Iran]{.underline}.
[Direct U.S. action is undesirable]{.underline} [because]{.underline}
[it is dangerous and risks being ineffective.]{.underline}

Foreign Relations, accessed: 6-9-2019,
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea //ng)

Congress will closely scrutinize the proposed arms deal with Saudi
Arabia to make sure it does not threaten Israel or otherwise destabilize
the region. [The package appears to be a careful reconciliation of Saudi
requirements with Israeli fears, while]{.underline} also
[offering]{.underline} a [strategic balance against Iran. The biggest
component of the transaction involves]{.underline} new and [refurbished
F-15 fighters]{.underline}, [which are designed for both
air]{.underline} dominance [and]{.underline} attack of [ground
targets]{.underline}. The fighter sale could have been a serious problem
for Israel if Saudi Arabia had been offered stealthy F-22s or F-35s,
because those aircraft would have been suitable for executing a surprise
attack. The F-15 is not stealthy, and although its movements can be
masked through the skillful application of tactics and
electronic-warfare technology, [Israeli defenders should have no
difficulty detecting any threatening moves]{.underline}. \"I see little
danger to Israel in the proposed transaction. For Iran, though, the
transaction presents a powerful deterrent since there is nothing in
Teheran's current arsenal that can cope with the latest versions of the
F-15 fighter or the AH-64 attack helicopter.\" [The helicopters included
in the package are among the most capable in the world]{.underline}, but
they could be easily repulsed by Israeli tactical aircraft if ever
dispatched against the Jewish state. Thus, I see little danger to Israel
in the proposed transaction. [For Iran]{.underline}, though, [the
transaction presents a powerful deterrent]{.underline} [since there is
nothing in Tehran's]{.underline} current [arsenal that can cope with the
latest versions of the F-15 fighter or]{.underline} the [AH-64 attack
helicopte]{.underline}r. The radical Shiite regime in Iran constitutes
the most serious military threat to Saudi Arabia, so I expect that the
pending arms sale will be followed by additional agreements to modernize
the Saudi Eastern Fleet in the Gulf and upgrade missile defenses. If
Congress delays or modifies the proposed transaction, the Saudi
government will probably move to purchase modern weapons from other
sources such as Britain or France. The kingdom needs to replace its
aging Cold War arsenal, and it is surrounded by nations potentially
posing a threat to its security. Little purpose would be served by
declining to assist Saudi Arabia in meeting its legitimate defensive
needs. Whatever the differences may be between our governments and
cultures, the [Saudis]{.underline} have been reliable allies of America
for decades and [have exercised a moderating influence on the behavior
of other oil-producing states]{.underline}. [Helping them means helping
ourselves.]{.underline}

### 2NC Solves Middle East

#### Saudi Arabia is key to American strategy in the middle east\-\--only the counterplan can preserve the relationship 

**Cordesman 18** (Anthony, 3-21-2018, Saudi Arabia is a critical
American security partner in the Middle East, TheHill, accessed:

https://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east
//ng)

Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that [our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} [our most important single security
partner]{.underline}. Israel's security is certainly a key American
concern, but it does not play an active role in most of America's
ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with Iran, or in
a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS and Al
Qaeda. [Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} also [been]{.underline} [enhanced]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} [the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their
own internal stability]{.underline} and their roles in the region have
sharply diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major
instability problems and are at war. Our European allies have declining
power projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the region is
increasingly problematic. It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs
the United States as much or more than the United States needs Saudi
Arabia. [Saudi military forces are steadily improving,]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} it is the [U.S. presence]{.underline} in the region
that [create a balance of forces]{.underline} [that firmly deters Iran
and has helped Saudi Arabia defeat]{.underline} [its own terrorist
threats]{.underline} from groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and exercises also play a critical
role in improving Saudi forces. But the United States needs Saudi Arabia
as well. [Saudi Arabia is now the most critical single
security]{.underline} [partner]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [ensuring
the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf region]{.underline}. While
[the United States]{.underline} [is]{.underline} largely eliminating its
need for direct petroleum imports, it is [steadily increasing its
dependence]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [health and growth of the
global economy]{.underline} [and imports from]{.underline} Asian states
[like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan]{.underline}, [which are
critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports.]{.underline} The end
result is that U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to
increase in spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports. This is
why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi
Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States
should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the White
House. [Saudi Arabia's]{.underline} [reform]{.underline} [and economic
development]{.underline} plans [are critical to]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} [stability and the region's security]{.underline}.
[The kingdom needs U.S. encouragement]{.underline} [and]{.underline} an
[understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot implement]{.underline} these
[plans effectively without outside support]{.underline}. The burden
sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a
source of ready money every time the United States has a need. It is
already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on security, which
is three times the economic burden security places on the United States.
This spending is too high given the kingdom's other needs, and the
United States should be focusing on better ways to make its security
partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and
Jordan more efficient and less costly, not simply on spending more. At
the same time, [Iran is all too real a threat]{.underline}. [Effective
joint action in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs]{.underline}, its
ballistic and cruise missile programs, [its asymmetric threats to Gulf
shipping, and expending]{.underline} military [influence]{.underline} in
the region [are all critical common U.S. and Saudi
priorities.]{.underline} The United States also badly needs to find some
common approach to dealing with Iraq and Syria that will move both
towards recovery and lasting stability, limit Iranian and Russian
influence as much as possible, and help stabilize relations with Turkey.
There are no easy options in either case, but Saudi Arabia is the key
potential Arab partner any such efforts. The United States, especially
members of Congress, needs to remember that we have had at least as many
military problems in fighting the Iraq and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates have faced in fighting in Yemen. Cutting
U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do little more that lead the
Saudis to ignore the systems that the United States has helped set up to
limit targeting of civilians and using unguided and more damaging air
munitions. It raises a whole new round of questions about the U.S
commitment to its partners in the region. [We]{.underline} [need to
forge a common solution in Yemen]{.underline}, [not a
decoupling]{.underline} [that leaves Saudi Arabia exposed]{.underline}.
This would fail in both military and human rights terms, and leaves both
the United States and Saudi Arabia with no options for dealing with the
Houthi or Iran, seeking ways to end the war, dealing with Al Qaida or
the other terrorist movements in Yemen, and without any means to help
Yemen back to some form of stability and development. These challenges
are also are reasons why the United States should do as much as possible
to persuade Mohammed Bin Salman to end the divisions that have led Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to split with Qatar, and to rising
tensions with Oman. [More unity between the southern Gulf
states]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [dealing with Iran and
terrorism]{.underline} [can do far more to help the United states than
more arms sales]{.underline}. Finally, [more interoperability, common
facilities]{.underline} [and cooperation are key to countering
Iran.]{.underline}

#### Conditioning signals a change rather than erasure of the alliance 

**Spindel 19** (Jennifer, 5-14-2019, The Case for Suspending American
Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia, War on the Rocks, accessed: 5-30-2019,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/
//ng)

Beyond signaling, we know U.S. arms sales often end up in the wrong
hands, and have been used in Yemen. The Saudi-led war in Yemen has led
to starvation conditions, caused thousands of civilian casualties, and
has led to the displacement of millions of people. The United Nations
estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's population -- 24 million people --
require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the
severity of the situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create
meaningful change in Yemen? An initial effect of an embargo is that
Saudi Arabia would have to work harder to access war materiel. As
Jonathan Caverley noted, more than 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms
delivered in the past five years came from the United States. [Even if
this percentage decreases over time, it will be costly for Saudi Arabia
to transition]{.underline} [to]{.underline} a primarily
[Russian]{.underline}- [or Chinese-supplied military]{.underline}.
Though Saudi Arabia might be willing to pay this cost, it would still
have to pay, and take the time to transition to its new weapons systems.
[This would represent a brief break in hostilities that could
facilitate]{.underline} the [delivery of aid and assistance in Yemen.
The United States could]{.underline}, in theory, [impose stricter
end-user controls]{.underline} on Saudi Arabia. [This would have the
advantage of keeping Saudi Arabia within t]{.underline}he world of U.[S.
weapons systems, and]{.underline} might [prevent it from diversifying
its suppliers]{.underline}, which would ultimately weaken any leverage
the United States might have. Longer-term, it would not be to America's
advantage if Saudi Arabia takes a lesson from Turkey, and starts
courting Russia as a new arms supplier. It is difficult to enforce
end-user controls, since, once a weapon is transferred, the recipient
can use it however it wishes. It might also be the case that Saudi
Arabia would object to stricter end-user controls, and would seek new
suppliers as a result. [An]{.underline} arms [embargo will not be a
panace]{.underline}a. [But not doing something sets]{.underline} a
problematic [precedent]{.underline}, and allows the difficulty of
coordinating an arms embargo outweigh the potential benefits of one. An
embargo is unlikely to have an immediate effect on Saudi behavior,
[because an embargo would be a political signal]{.underline}, [rather
than a blunt instrument of coercion]{.underline}. It will take time for
a multilateral embargo to emerge and be put into place, [and the United
States should work with its allies to help support their ability to
participate in the embargo]{.underline}. [Not acting,]{.underline}
however, [would continue to implicitly endorse Saudi
behavior]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} would [make it more difficult
for U.S. allies to believe that future threats of an embargo are
credible.]{.underline}

### 2NC Solves Yemen

#### Arms sales is critical leverage to change Saudi behavior in yemen

While the [Saudis]{.underline} [are quick to blame Iran]{.underline} for
the war, several [researchers]{.underline}, including Thomas Juneau, a
professor at the University of Ottawa and a former analyst at Canada's
Department of National Defense, [have shown that the Houthis did not
receive significant]{.underline} [support from Tehran
before]{.underline} the [Saudi intervention in 2015]{.underline}. Iran
has stepped up military assistance to the Houthis since the war, and
Hezbollah has begun sending military advisers to train the Yemeni
rebels. But the costs of this assistance fall far short of those
incurred by Saudi Arabia and its allies. [For Iran, the Yemen conflict
is a low-cost way to bleed its regional rival.]{.underline} The
[Saudis]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Emiratis have largely ignored
international criticism]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [civilian
deaths]{.underline} and appeals for a political settlement---and the
[Trump]{.underline} administration's latest [signal of support shows
that strategy is working]{.underline}. Investigations by the UN and
other bodies have found both the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition
responsible for potential war crimes. But air strikes by the Saudis and
their allies "have caused most of the documented civilian casualties,"
the UN concluded in a report last month. On August 9, the Saudi
coalition bombed a school bus in the northern town of Dahyan, killing 54
people, 44 of them children, and wounding dozens, according to Yemeni
health officials. For weeks, the coalition defended the airstrike, but
on September 1---with the deadline looming for the Trump administration
to certify Saudi and UAE efforts to reduce civilian casualties---the
coalition admitted that the bombing was a mistake and that it would
"hold those who committed mistakes" accountable. U.S. officials seized
on that statement as evidence that the Saudi coalition is willing to
change its behavior. But for three and a half years now, there has been
"little evidence of any attempt by parties to the conflict to minimize
civilian casualties," said Kamel Jendoubi, the chair of the UN
investigation team that documented war crimes. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration [has shown little interest in using arms deals as
leverage for a political settlement]{.underline}, or to force the Saudis
to take concerns about civilian deaths more seriously. In March 2017,
[Trump]{.underline} [reversed]{.underline} [a decision by]{.underline}
the [Obama]{.underline} [administration to suspend the sale of more than
\$500 million in laser-guided]{.underline} [bombs]{.underline} and other
munitions to the Saudi military. As more members of Congress expressed
criticism of Saudi actions in Yemen, the Senate narrowly approved that
sale. After the Houthis fired ballistic missiles at several Saudi cities
in late 2017, the Trump administration again escalated U.S. involvement
in the war. The New York Times broke the news that the Pentagon had
secretly dispatched U.S. special forces to the Saudi-Yemen border to
help the Saudi military locate and destroy Houthi missile sites.
Frustrated by the deepening U.S. role, two dozen members of the House
introduced a resolution this week invoking the 1973 War Powers Act,
arguing that Congress never authorized American support for the Saudi
coalition and instructing Trump to withdraw U.S. forces. [Saudi and
Emirati leaders want a clear-cut victory]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
their [regional rivalry with Iran]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} they
[have been emboldened by the Trump]{.underline} administration's
unconditional [support to stall negotiations]{.underline}. A recent UN
effort to hold peace talks between the Houthis, Hadi's government, and
the Saudi-led coalition collapsed in early September, after the Houthi
delegation did not show up in Geneva. Houthi leaders said the Saudis,
who control Yemen's airspace, would not guarantee their safe travel.
Days later, Yemeni forces loyal to the Saudi-UAE alliance launched a new
offensive aimed at forcing the Houthis out of Hodeidah port, which is
the major conduit for humanitarian aid in Yemen. UN officials warn that
a prolonged battle for the port and its surroundings could lead to the
death of 250,000 people, mainly from mass starvation.
[After]{.underline} the [Trump administration's]{.underline}
[endorsement]{.underline} this month[, the Saudi-UAE alliance has even
less incentive to prevent]{.underline} civilian [casualties]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} new [humanitarian disasters]{.underline}. [Saudi
Arabia and its allies are more likely to accep]{.underline}t a
[peace]{.underline} process [if it is clear that the United States won't
support an open-ended war in Yemen]{.underline} [and won't provide the
military assistance]{.underline} [required to keep the war apparatus
going]{.underline}. But Trump has shown little sign of pressuring his
Saudi and Emirati allies, least of all over Yemen. [The]{.underline}
[only realistic check left is in Congress]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} more [voices are asking why the world's most
powerful country]{.underline} [is helping to perpetuate the world's
worst humanitarian crisis.]{.underline}

#### Targeting air support would put pressure on Saudis

[Obfuscation and impunity continue to characterize]{.underline} the
[coalition's airstrike campaig]{.underline}n. The coalition rarely
identifies which country carries out an airstrike, although the vast
majority are Saudi and Emirati, officials say. In July, King Salman of
Saudi Arabia issued an order lifting "all military and disciplinary
penalties" for Saudi troops fighting in Yemen, an apparent amnesty for
possible war crimes. Over the summer, as Emirati warplanes pounded the
Red Sea port of Hudaydah, General Votel and the defense secretary at the
time, Jim [Mattis]{.underline}, [held at least 10 phone
calls]{.underline} or video conferences [with Saudi and Emirati leaders,
urging them to show restraint]{.underline}, a senior American military
official and a senior Western official said. At least one of the
conferences involved Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi
and the effective leader of the United Arab Emirates. "The Saudis are
decent partners," Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr., a former top commander of
American air forces in the Middle East, said in an interview. "And
sometimes our partners don't always do things we would expect." Short of
halting all weapons sales, critics say [the United States could pressure
the Saudis by curtailing its assistance to the air war. Hundreds of
American aviation mechanics and other specialists]{.underline}, working
under Defense Department contracts, [keep the Saudi F-15 fleet in the
air]{.underline}. In 2017, Boeing signed a \$480 million contract for
service repairs to the fleet. But [after the departure of]{.underline}
Mr. [Mattis]{.underline}, who resigned last week, the Defense Department
will be helmed by Patrick M. Shanahan, an arms industry insider. Mr.
Shanahan, the acting defense secretary as of Jan 1., spent more than
three decades at Boeing, the F-15 manufacturer which has earned further
billions from lucrative service contracts in Saudi Arabia. Pentagon
officials said that in his current job as deputy defense secretary, Mr.
Shanahan had recused himself from decisions involving Boeing. Daniel L.
Byman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service,
said that a more robust policy toward Saudi airstrikes would not just be
good for Yemeni civilians --- it would also help the Saudis. "This war
has been a strategic disaster for the Saudis," he said. The airstrikes
have shown no sign of defeating the Houthis, and the Houthis' foreign
ally, Iran, has gained from Saudi Arabia's clumsy prosecution of the
war. ["The United States needs to use its power to promote peace and
stability in Yemen]{.underline}," Mr. Byman said. "And it needs to
protect its allies from themselves."

And while the oil-rich country isn\'t likely to follow through with what
many saw as a veiled threat to [pressure]{.underline} [the energy
market]{.underline} if the West imposes sanctions against Riyadh,
[analysts aren\'t ruling that scenario out.]{.underline} \"We believe
that Saudi leadership would be extremely reluctant to exercise the oil
weapon option, as its reputation as the world's stable, reliable oil
central banker would be severely undercut,\" RBC analysts wrote in a
research note. \"Perhaps more likely is a Saudi decision to slow-walk
any Trump inspired output hikes as the Iran energy sanctions deadline
looms.\" [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, [the largest crude exporter in the
world]{.underline}, [is set to play an increasingly crucial role
in]{.underline} [maintaining]{.underline} [global supply]{.underline}
when US sanctions against Iran take effect next month. Following
requests from the Trump administration, Riyadh agreed to increase output
by a \"measurable\" amount earlier this year. [\"The
Kingdom]{.underline} already [looks to be close to reaching the upward
limits of what]{.underline} [it can easily bring on, an]{.underline}d it
[could now dress up any near-term production constraints as]{.underline}
a [deliberate policy choice,\"]{.underline} the analysts wrote. While
analysts doubt Riyadh would go as far as an energy embargo now, the
government has used oil resources to exert political pressure before.
During the 19 70s, a Saudi-led coalition slashed oil exports to the US
in protest of Washington\'s support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War.
\"[We cannot entirely rule out]{.underline} that the leadership would
dust off [the 1973 playbook]{.underline} if the bilateral relationship
with Washington deteriorates sharply from here,\" RBC added. [Saudi
Arabia and other]{.underline} [OPEC]{.underline} [members]{.underline}
[slashed]{.underline} about a quarter of total [oil production that
year]{.underline}, [sparking]{.underline} [an energy crisis across the
world]{.underline}. Prices nearly quadrupled, rising to about \$12 per
barrel in 1974 from \$3 per barrel two years earlier. But after failing
to achieve major policy goals, the embargo and output cuts were both
lifted. Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics,
agrees Riyadh would be reluctant to go that route this time around. But
she said [energy costs could nearly double]{.underline} by the end of
the year [if it did come to that]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} [Brent
already at four-year highs]{.underline}, [above \$81 a
barrel]{.underline}, and output disruptions among key OPEC producers.
\"[This does not look too improbable]{.underline} [given]{.underline}
that the [Saudi cut would come at a time of declining output in
Venezuela and Iran]{.underline},\" Bain said. \"[The oil
price]{.underline} \... [has already proved its sensitivity to changes
in supply this year]{.underline}, rising by nearly 20% since August on
fears of a sharp drop in Iran's production as a result of the
re-imposition of US sanctions.\"

[A leak of classified documents]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
[French Directorate of Military Intelligence]{.underline}
[shows]{.underline} that [Saudi]{.underline} [Arabia]{.underline} [and
the United Arab Emirates]{.underline} [are extremely dependent on
U.S.]{.underline} [and European]{.underline} [weapons for their war on
Yemen]{.underline}. The documents, released by French investigative
journalism organization Disclose and translated by the Intercept, reveal
that the U.S., France, and the U.K. assist coalition forces with
targeting, making these countries complicit in war crimes; that France
is aware that their weapons are routinely used in attacking civilians in
Yemen; and that Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. are so dependent on NATO
weaponry that it would take decades to replace it with Chinese or
Russian weapons and to retrain soldiers with the new equipment. The
documents illustrate how crucial U.S. and Western ally support is to the
war in Yemen, explained The Real News Network's Greg Wilpert. [If Saudi
Arabia were to stop buying arms]{.underline} [from the U.S. and its
allies]{.underline} [they could not easily substitute them with other
weapons purchases]{.underline}, which contradicts the argument made by
the U.S. and other governments that the war would continue regardless of
their involvement. "[There is not a clear path for them to
just]{.underline} [switch]{.underline} over [to Russian]{.underline}
manufactured [weapons]{.underline}. It\'s kind of like switching from
Macintosh to Microsoft[. It\'s just not an easy transition. It takes a
lot of time,"]{.underline} Hassan El-Tayyab, co-director of Just Foreign
Policy, said. "So again, it kind of deeply involves the United States,
and there are bipartisan majorities that want to end this war. And now
we have proof just how urgent that is and how much we could impact the
situation on the ground for millions of Yemenis that are living on the
brink of famine by stopping these arms sales." "[This secret report that
was leaked just increases]{.underline} the [urgency]{.underline} for the
U.S. Senate to override Trump\'s veto and to push to end this illegal
war. It\'s horrifying to know just how complicit we are in Saudi
coalition war crimes in Yemen," El-Tayyab said, referring to the Senate
resolution invoking the 1973 War Powers Act since vetoed by Donald
Trump. The resolution would direct Trump to remove U.S. forces from
Yemen on the basis that there was no formal declaration of war. The
House could override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both House and
Senate, El-Tayyab explained.

The continued escalation of attacks against the port city of Hodeida in
Yemen by the U.S.-Saudi-Emirati coalition confirms that the American
calls for a cease-fire are nothing but empty talk. The recent statements
are trying to mislead the world. [Saudi leaders are reckless and have no
interest in diplomacy.]{.underline} [The United States has the clout to
bring an end to the conflict]{.underline} --- but [it has decided to
protect a corrupt ally]{.underline}. Any observer of the crimes
committed in Yemen by Saudi Arabia --- a campaign that has been
accompanied by disinformation and a blockade of journalists trying to
cover the war --- [can offer an account of the indiscriminate killing
thousands of civilians]{.underline}, mostly [through
airstrikes]{.underline}. [Their attacks have led to the greatest
humanitarian crisis on earth.]{.underline} The brutality of the Saudi
regime was reflected in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
And it can be seen in the military escalation and airstrikes in Hodeida
and other cities, in defiance of all international warnings. The
[blockade of the port city is meant to bring the Yemeni people to their
knees]{.underline}. [The coalition is using famine]{.underline} [and
cholera]{.underline} [as weapons of war]{.underline}. It is also
extorting the United Nations by threatening to cut their funds, as if it
were a charity and not a responsibility required under international law
and Security Council resolutions. [The United States wants to be viewed
as an honest mediator]{.underline} --- [but]{.underline} it [is in fact
participating and sometimes leading the aggression on
Yemen.]{.underline} We are defending ourselves --- but we don't have
warplanes like the ones that bomb Yemenis with banned ammunition. We
can't lift the blockade imposed on Yemeni imports and exports. We cannot
cancel the air embargo and allow daily flights, or end the ban of
importing basic commodities, medicines and medical equipment from any
place other than the United Arab Emirates, as it is imposing on Yemeni
business executives. And the list goes on. These repressive practices
are killing and destroying Yemen. [Yemen was not the one who declared
the war in the first place]{.underline}. Even Jamal Benomar, the former
United Nations envoy to Yemen, said we were close to a power-sharing
deal in 2015 that was disrupted by the coalition airstrikes. [We are
ready to stop the missiles if the Saudi-led coalition stops its
airstrikes.]{.underline} But [the]{.underline} [United States' calling

#### Houthis want less arms sales to saudi aribia\-\--Britain proves

Hunt over efforts to relax Saudi arms ban, Guardian, accessed:

//ng)

The leader of the Houthi movement in Yemen has condemned the British
foreign secretary for pressing Germany to relax its arms sales ban on
Saudi Arabia, saying it was not possible for the UK to be a peace-broker
in the country and an arms seller. "[Britain sending aid does not
change]{.underline} the [tragic reality of its arms sales.]{.underline}
Jeremy Hunt cannot promote peace while at the same time acting as an
arms salesman," [said]{.underline} [Mohamed Ali al-Houthi,]{.underline}
[the head of the supreme revolutionary committee]{.underline}, in an
interview with the Guardian. His comments are the most direct criticism
yet of Hunt, who has been acting as a mediator in the four-year civil
war in Yemen. Germany announced in November that due to the killing of
the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents it would
provide no further arms export licences to Saudi Arabia. It has not
formally banned previously approved deals but has urged industry to
refrain from such shipments for now. Sunday was the deadline for the ban
to end unless an extension was agreed, which resulted in a compromise
this week whereby the ban was extended for another six months , but with
a loophole inserted that gives German defence firms until the end of the
year to complete contracts that supply parts for UK and France arms
sales. The German government said efforts would be made to ensure that
these jointly supplied arms were not used in the war in Yemen, although
how such a condition can be enforced is unclear. A half-complete
bilateral German contract for 35 patrol boats may also be allowed to go
ahead, but not sent to Saudi Arabia. Britain has been worried about the
sale of 48 Eurofighter jets to Saudi Arabia, and needs parts from
Germany. Britain says its arms sales are lawful since the weapons are
not at risk of being used in breach of international humanitarian law.
Both Hunt and the French government have been lobbying the German
coalition to allow the arms sales, but there has been an impasse between
the Social Democrats, who oppose the sales, the Christian Democrats, who
back them. The resolution of the German dispute is seen by the European
arms industry as critical to ensuring Europe has an integrated defence
policy. The UK has sold at least £5.7bn worth of arms to the Saudi-led
coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015, according to a Sky News analysis
of figures published on Friday. Condemning the UK role, Houthi added:
"Mr Hunt has gone beyond defending British arms sales, by attempting to
pressure other European countries, such as Germany, to sell arms. ["If
it wasn't for the joint]{.underline} [British, US, Saudi, and
UAE]{.underline} naval [forces]{.underline}, the [existing famine and
the tragic humanitarian situation wouldn't reach such critical levels,
including]{.underline} as he admits about [24 million Yemeni need an
emergency aid of food and medicine."]{.underline} Houthi said: "[The
Saudi-led coalition,]{.underline} backed by Britain, [commits war crimes
and does not abide by]{.underline}, as Britain claims, 'the most
[stringent guidelines for the export of weapons]{.underline} in the
world'. The principles mentioned are solely for political speech and to
avoid the legal and moral responsibility concerning the war crimes and
humanitarian situation that the British government faces as part of such
alliance". France has also demanded that the arms sales ban be relaxed.
France's ambassador to Germany, Anne-Marie Descôtes, said in an open
letter this week that the German arms export policy and cumbersome
licensing rules threatened future bilateral defence projects. Tuesday
marked the fourth anniversary of the intervention by a western-backed
military coalition led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen's civil war, which has
killed at least 60,000 people, left half the country's 22 million
population food insecure and sparked the worst cholera outbreak in
modern history. [The coalition and the western governments who
supply]{.underline} it with [arms have been repeatedly
criticised]{.underline} [by rights groups and conflict monitors for
bombing campaigns]{.underline} [which have hit schools]{.underline},
health facilities, funeral gatherings and wedding parties, [killing
thousands of civilians.]{.underline} Yemen's government and Saudi Arabia
accuse the Houthis of using civilians as human shields. The Houthis have
launched long-range missiles into neighbouring Saudi Arabia and targeted
Saudi ships in the Red Sea. All side may be responsible for war crimes,
the UN has said. The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, was
in Riyadh this week to discuss the stalled peace effort in Yemen,
including the question of the Saudi-backed and UN-recognised government
of Yemen accepting a new security force in the Red Sea port of Hodeida.
Diplomats fear that neither side have sufficient incentive to
compromise. [The Houthi criticism will have riled the foreign
secretary]{.underline}, [who would argue that he has gone
further]{.underline} than his predecessors [in using his private
influence on the Saudis to urge them to show restraint]{.underline} and
patience in the face of delays in implementing a peace agreement set out
in Stockholm in December.

### 2NC A2 Europe Follow On 

#### European follow on is a solvency defict to the aff but not the counterplan\-\--there is no coordinated effort by the plan\-\--condition signals that there must be international cooperation

If this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia,
[an arms embargo would signal that Saudi Arabia does not have the
support of the United States.]{.underline} [This signal would be an
important]{.underline} first [step in changing Saudi
behavior]{.underline} [because it would override other statements and
actions]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [United States has sent that
indicate support.]{.underline} And Trump has given Saudi Arabia a number
of positive signals: He called Saudi Arabia a "great ally" and dismissed
reports that that the Saudi government was involved in the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested in selling
nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he has
repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why should
Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come out of
the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump, anyway? An
arms embargo would be a clear and unambiguous signal that the United
States disproves of Saudi actions in Yemen. [The]{.underline} second
[reason for supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and]{.underline}
the [logistical difficulties of making an embargo have an
effect]{.underline}. One of the reasons embargoes have little material
impact is because they require cooperation among weapons exporting
states. A [ban on sales from one country will have little
effect]{.underline} [if]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[target]{.underline} of the embargo [can seek arms
elsewhere]{.underline}. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh
in November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European
states to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the
importance of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of
the German Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi
Arabia would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to
the continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German
embargo has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms
elsewhere. According to the 2019 Military Balance, [most of Saudi
Arabia's equipment is American or French in origin]{.underline}, such as
the M1A2 Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and
F-15C/D fighter jets. [Saudi Arabia has some equipment
manufactured]{.underline} wholly or [in]{.underline} part in
[Germany]{.underline}, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado
ground attack craft, [but these weapons are a small portion of its
complete arsenal. A U.S. embargo would send an important
signal]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [allies]{.underline}
[who]{.underline} also [supply Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, [allowing them
to explain participation]{.underline} in the embargo [to their own
domestic constituencies]{.underline}. [This is especially important for
countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom]{.underline},
[that]{.underline} [need]{.underline} to export [arms]{.underline} [to
keep their own production lines running]{.underline}. While the research
shows that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most difficult step,
embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports. [Even if a U.S.
embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia]{.underline} on its
own, [an embargo is important for building coalitions]{.underline} for a
more expansive embargo [that could affect Saudi behavior.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia says yes\-\--they rely on US weaponry and neither china or russia can fill in

If American officials really want to encourage a change in Saudi policy,
they should begin by looking at Saudi Arabia's largest imports from the
United States: weaponry. [Cutting off the flow of American]{.underline}
[arms]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia [would be an effective way to put
pressure]{.underline} [on Riyadh with little cost to the]{.underline}
American [economy]{.underline} or national security. President Trump,
however, is skeptical. "I don't like stopping massive amounts of money
that's being poured into our country," he said on Thursday. "They are
spending \$110 billion on military equipment and on things that create
jobs for this country." This figure is vastly inflated, but there's a
reason Mr. Trump is inclined to believe it. While the amount of new
deals approved under President Trump is closer to \$20 billion, the
Saudi government has visibly linked itself as the foremost client of the
administration's export push. Peter Navarro, the White House's director
of trade and industrial policy, has argued that increased arms sales
"will be an important catalyst for strengthening American industry; the
stewardship of our national security; and the strengthening of our
international partnerships." But the truth is that in the case of Saudi
Arabia, the benefits on all three fronts are slight. Despite recent
increases, Saudi arms orders remain a manageably small part of the
United States' exports. According to the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, in 2017, a near-record year for annual purchases, the United
States delivered \$5.5 billion worth of arms, 20 percent of all foreign
military sales. That may sound like a lot, but the United States exports
only 25 to 30 percent of its defense industry production, so exports to
Saudi Arabia clearly remain a relatively small slice of the enormous
defense industrial pie. And contrary to President Trump's statement,
exports to Saudi Arabia create relatively few American jobs. Based on
Commerce Department figures, releasing the billion dollars of munitions
currently on hold in the Senate would "create or sustain" fewer than
4,000 jobs. Here's a more specific example: Publicizing a recent \$6
billion helicopter deal with Saudi Arabia, Lockheed Martin predicted
that it would "support" 450 American jobs. To date these sales have not
"stewarded our national security." Beyond its tragic war in Yemen, Saudi
Arabia has blockaded Qatar, an ally that hosts the Middle East's largest
American military base. And Saudi Arabia provides little help when it
comes to Washington's real regional priorities, such as fighting the
Islamic State and stabilizing Iraq. The Pentagon's National Defense
Strategy specifically de-emphasizes the war on terror to focus on
competition with China and Russia. Perhaps selling weapons "strengthens
international partnerships," as Mr. Navarro put it, or at least
discourages Saudi Arabia from finding different ones. Mr. Trump on
Thursday cited "four or five alternatives" to American weapons, and the
need to avoid "letting Russia have that money and letting China have
that money." This, however, is unlikely even in the long term. [Saudi
Arabia is in the middle of a major war]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} [than 60 percent]{.underline} [of its
arms]{.underline} deliveries over the past five years [came from the
United States]{.underline}. [The Saudi military]{.underline}
[relies]{.underline} [not just on American]{.underline}
[tanks]{.underline}, [planes]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[missiles]{.underline} [but]{.underline} for a [daily]{.underline}
supply of [maintenance]{.underline}, training and [support]{.underline},
such as [intelligence]{.underline} [and refueling]{.underline}. In the
longer term, almost all of Saudi Arabia's remaining exports come from
Europe. To truly squeeze Saudi Arabia, a coordinated embargo --- much
like the one now in place against Russia --- would be necessary but
relatively easy. [European governments already feel strong domestic
political pressure]{.underline} [not to export to]{.underline} regimes
like [Saudi Arabia. Transforming]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Saudi
military to]{.underline} [employ]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline},
[much less Chinese]{.underline}, [weapons]{.underline} [would cost a
fortune even by Gulf standards]{.underline}, [would require years of
retraining]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [would]{.underline} greatly
[reduce]{.underline} its [military]{.underline} [power]{.underline} [for
a generation.]{.underline} [Russia cannot produce
next-generation]{.underline} fighter [aircraft]{.underline},
[tanks]{.underline} [and]{.underline} infantry [fighting vehicles for
its own armed forces]{.underline}, [much]{.underline} [less]{.underline}
for [the export market]{.underline}. [China has not
produced,]{.underline} never mind exported, the
[sophisticated]{.underline} [aircraft]{.underline} and missile defense
systems [Saudi Arabia wants.]{.underline} Last month, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo certified that Saudi Arabia was minimizing civilian
casualties in the Yemen air campaign apparently to avoid jeopardizing
\$2 billion in weapons sales. That small number does not show how
powerful the Saudis are so much as how cheaply the United States can be
bought. Given these sales' low domestic economic impact and the enormous
costs of going elsewhere for Saudi Arabia, [the United States has the
preponderance of influence in this]{.underline} arms trade
[relationship]{.underline}. [It should act accordingly.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are too important for Saudi to say no

//ng)

In June 2017, after the president's visit to Riyadh---his first official
foreign travel---we published a Brookings blog post detailing that his
claims to have sold \$110 billion in weapons were spurious. Other media
outlets subsequently came to the same conclusion. When Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the White House this year, [the
president indirectly confirmed that non-deal by chiding the prince for
spending only "peanuts" on arms from America. The Saudis]{.underline}
have [continued]{.underline} [to buy spare parts,]{.underline}
[munitions]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} technical [support for the
enormous amount of]{.underline} American [equipment they have bought
from previous administrations]{.underline}. The Royal Saudi Air Force
(RSAF) is entirely dependent on American and British support for its air
fleet of F15 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and Tornado aircraft. If
either Washington or London halts the flow of logistics, the RSAF will
be grounded. The Saudi army and the Saudi Arabian National Guard are
similarly dependent on foreigners (the Saudi Arabian National Guard is
heavily dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the Saudis
allies like Bahrain. Under President Obama[, Saudi Arabia spent well
over \$110 billion in U.S. weapons]{.underline}, including for
[aircraft]{.underline}, [helicopters]{.underline}, [and air
defense]{.underline} [missiles]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} deals
[were the largest in American history]{.underline}. [Saudi]{.underline}
[commentators]{.underline} routinely decried Obama for failing to
protect Saudi interests, but the kingdom [loved]{.underline} his [arms
deals.]{.underline} But the kingdom has not bought any new arms platform
during the Trump administration. Only one has even been seriously
discussed: A \$15 billion deal for THAAD, terminal high altitude area
defense missiles, has gotten the most attention and preliminary approval
from Congress, but the Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal
with Lockheed Martin. [The Saudis certainly need more air defenses with
the pro-Iran Zaydi Shiite Houthi rebels]{.underline} [in Yemen firing
ballistic missiles at Saudi cities.]{.underline} Shaking the arms
relationship is by far the most important way to clip his wings.
[The]{.underline} three and a half year-old Saudi [war in Yemen is
hugely expensive]{.underline}. There are no public figures from the
Saudi government about the war's costs, but [a conservative estimate
would be at least \$50 billion per year]{.underline}. Maintenance costs
for aircraft and warships go up dramatically when they are constantly in
combat operations. The Royal Saudi Navy has been blockading Yemen for
over 40 months. The RSAF has conducted thousands of air strikes. [The
war is draining the kingdom's coffers]{.underline}. And responsibility
for the war is on Mohammed bin Salman, who as defense minister has
driven Riyadh into this quagmire. [Shaking the arms relationship is by
far the most important way to clip his wings.]{.underline}

"We all want this conflict to end," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said
Friday of the war [in Yemen]{.underline}. "We all want to improve the
[dire humanitarian situation]{.underline}. But the [Trump administration
fundamentally disagrees]{.underline} that [curbing our assistance to the
Saudi-led coalition is the way to achieve these goals]{.underline}," he
continued. "The way to alleviate the Yemeni people's suffering isn't to
prolong the conflict by handicapping our partners in the fight, but by
giving the Saudi-led coalition the support needed to defeat
Iranian-backed rebels and ensure a just peace." Pompeo's remarks were a
last-ditch effort to discourage the House from following in the Senate's
footsteps by passing a resolution requiring the Trump administration to
stop supporting the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen's civil war. As the
House already approved a similar measure and now must merely vote again
on the Senate's edits, Pompeo's pushback is likely to fail. Another
"yes" vote in the House would complete the first such rebuke of
executive war-making under the War Powers Act of 1973, though President
Trump is expected to veto. Whatever the revolution\'s final fate,
[Pompeo's claims are specious and false]{.underline}. There is [**no
reason to believe** the **Saudi intervention has minimized the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen**]{.underline}, [widely considered the
**world's most acute**]{.underline}**.** [On the contrary, **independent
observers agree the opposite is true**]{.underline} --- [Saudi-led
forces have been credibly accused of war crimes]{.underline} --- and
that the Saudi coalition's [careless approach to civilian
welfare]{.underline} is [enabled by the support]{.underline} it has
received [from]{.underline} Western partners, chiefly [the United
States.]{.underline} Yemen would not overnight transform into a bastion
of peace and plenty without the coalition's involvement in its civil
war. The Houthi rebels the Saudi forces oppose are hardly innocent of
contributing to Yemen civilian misery, and Yemen was among the Middle
East's poorest nations even before its civil war began. But **[U.S.
backing of]{.underline}** the **[Saudi intervention has
exacerbated]{.underline}** this terrible **[situation.]{.underline}**
"The United States is implicated in the aerial destruction," notes Paul
Pillar at \"The National Interest.\" "[U.S. assistance to the
Saudi]{.underline} and Emirati [air war includes]{.underline} mid-air
refueling, targeting [information, and voluminous sales of
armaments]{.underline}," [including the bomb that struck a school bus,
killing 40 young boys last year]{.underline}. **[With Washington's help,
the Saudi coalition]{.underline}** has **[also launched strikes on
civilian targets]{.underline}** including homes, markets, weddings,
funerals, medical clinics, water treatment plants, and more. A coalition
naval blockade and restrictions on imports of food, medicine, and fuel
has been cast as a means of choking opposition supply lines, but it\'s
more significant effect is widespread starvation and preventable disease
among ordinary Yemenis. Prolonging U.S. assistance to this disastrous
intervention will not, as Pompeo says, "alleviate the Yemeni people's
suffering." It will do precisely the opposite. It will also accomplish
exactly nothing for American security and interests. Backing Riyadh's
fight is hurting Yemen without helping us. "The United States does not
have a stake in the outcome of civil warfare in Yemen," as Pillar
writes. "The Houthi rebellion is rooted in very local issues ... \[and
the\] Houthis \[do not\] pose more than a trivial threat to anyone else
in the region." [A withdrawal of U.S. support could well encourage the
Saudi coalition to seek a quick resolution to this conflict at the
negotiating table]{.underline}, but even if such a pivot to diplomacy
did not happen or was unsuccessful, the security risks to the United
States would remain minimal. The Houthis would remain a parochial
concern with no means to harm American interests. If anything, U.S.
backing of the Saudi fight has been detrimental to our own security
insofar as the ongoing chaos has permitted Al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP), a regional terrorist organization which does have
ambitions for overseas attacks, to flourish. In fact, coalition forces
have been caught bribing and recruiting AQAP fighters, putting
Washington in the absurd position of indirectly subsidizing a terrorist
group with ties to the perpetrators of 9/11. American weaponry sold to
Saudi Arabia has likewise been found in AQAP hands. The most plausible
route to ending Yemen's civil war and, in Pompeo's words, "ensur\[ing\]
a just peace," is not to stay the course in supporting the Saudi
coalition, as the secretary of state recommends. It is to end
Washington's backing for a catastrophic intervention which was never
ours to fight. [Continuing to help the Saudi war effort is a fool's
errand with cruel consequences for Yemeni civilians and no benefits for
the United States.]{.underline}

[The role of external actors impeding peace]{.underline} also [needs to
be considered]{.underline}. The [conflict can be seen as part of a

Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia looking to expand their influence. [Yemen is
strategically important]{.underline} [due to its position on a
strait]{.underline} linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, through
which much of the world's oil shipments pass. Although it denies its
involvement, [Iran has been widely accused of supporting the Houthis

coalition of war crimes. Conflict has also spilled over the border,
especially escalating as of late with a number of Houthi missiles and
drone attacks targeting Saudi cities. It can no longer justifiably be
thought of as a Yemeni-Yemeni war. As a major player in the conflict,
future talks and agreements on a peaceful political solution must
include Saudi Arabia, or otherwise ensure the country's continued

### 2AC Houthis Say No 

#### Counterplan condition is unmet now -- the Houthis will NOT agree to peace talks -- no incentives, lack of fear for international backlash, and distrust of SA wreck talks

GMDI

[Nearly six months since the]{.underline} so-called [Stockholm agreement
was signed by Yemen's warring parties]{.underline} in an effort to
prevent a deepening humanitarian crisis, [any semblance of progress is
almost dead. The agreement]{.underline}, signed on Dec. 13, stipulates
the redeployment of forces away from crucial sea ports in Hodeida, the
formation of a joint committee to address the long-besieged Taiz and the
exchange of war prisoners and political detainees. [Cheered by the
international community, it brought a dose of hope]{.underline} among
observers that [the first step toward peace]{.underline} in Yemen [might
be within reach.]{.underline} Yet the handshake between the heads of the
warring parties' delegations is as far as either side has budged. S[ince
December, there is little improvement to show on the ground --- and the
diplomatic obstacles keep piling up]{.underline}. Just last month,
[Yemen's internationally-recognized president,]{.underline} Abed Rabbo
Mansour [Hadi, temporarily suspended talks with U.N.]{.underline} envoy
Martin Griffiths [over allegations of bias toward the]{.underline}
Iran-aligned [Houthi militants]{.underline}. The move comes days after
Griffiths was accused of "transgressions" while briefing the U.N.
Security Council. This **[failure has come as no surprise to most
Yemenis,]{.underline}** who were hesitant from the beginning to pin any
hopes on the agreement being implemented. [Despite warnings from Yemeni
intellectuals and observers]{.underline} that **[the international
community was favoring political expediency over addressing the
conflict's root causes]{.underline}**, the parties appeared pressured to
reach a limited agreement that could bring the illusion of victory. The
[agreement lacked fundamental details]{.underline}. It did not identify
the authorities who would be responsible for monitoring Hodeida's ports,
or specify the mechanism of implementing the redeployment, thereby
leaving the most contentious issues to be sorted out later. More
importantly, [mediators from the United Nations ignored the imbalance of
power]{.underline} between the warring parties. The government of Yemen
was subjected to regional and international pressure, while the Houthis
were positioned on equal footing with the legitimate government, giving
them a victory simply for showing up. [This is the crux of the matter
that many outside Yemen choose to ignore:]{.underline} [**The Houthis
have no incentive to implement the agreement and, having learned from
their experience with the international community** during the years of
war, **do not fear the repercussions for violating it.** For any lasting
stability]{.underline} in Yemen and the region, [future peace efforts
should]{.underline} pursue a different course. The road map to peace in
Yemen must begin at home. The international community needs to use its
resources to help [rebuild Yemen's legitimate government]{.underline}.
The most important steps here are to help the government have a stronger
presence in liberated areas of the country and to rebuild state
institutions --- such as unified security forces, judiciary, the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing and financial institutions. [This,
of course, **will not happen** unless genuine **pressure is exerted on
the Saudi-led coalition**]{.underline} --- and the United Arab Emirates,
in particular, across southern Yemen --- [to cease their financing and
arming of non-state militias]{.underline}, many of which are directly at
odds with the legitimate government they ostensibly support. The efforts
by the Yemeni government to regain its sovereignty and control over
state institutions have long been crippled by the actions of Saudi
Arabia and the UAE. More than four years into the coalition's
intervention in Yemen, Saudi Arabia's strategy remains devoid of a
larger vision. Hiding behind the coalition, the UAE continues to carry
out a more calculated approach, weakening and dividing the Yemeni
government. Yet the Gulf state receives little criticism for its
endeavors in Yemen compared to Saudi Arabia, which weathers the punches
from the international community. This needs to end. It is also time to
embark on a political process between the parties who are united in
opposition to the Houthis but are divided by their desire for power ---
a vulnerability that has been further exploited during the ongoing
crisis. The dispute between Yemen's political parties can be resolved if
the process includes the reassembling of the Yemeni parliament in
liberated Yemeni territory and a reassessment of the presidency, so that
the decision-making process is more inclusive and is not solely in
Hadi's hands. Many Yemenis have been disappointed by the lack of
leadership displayed by Hadi over the past five years, not least because
he remains a "hotel president" living in Saudi Arabia. It will be nearly
impossible for Yemen to move forward without reshaping Hadi's position
or his responsibilities, as only a strong government with broad support
can lead Yemen to peace. T[he failure of the Stockholm
agreement]{.underline} to hold the parties to any sort of accountability
[should be a lesson]{.underline}. [If the international community fails
to strengthen the state's institutions]{.underline} and help the Yemeni
government to regain its sovereignty, the [underlying reasons for the
conflict will remain --- and the world's worst humanitarian crisis will
likely continue without respite.]{.underline}

### 1AR Houthis Say No 

#### Houthis won't agree to peace talks -- increasing military operations now to push back against hostile posturing

escalation: Why Houthis ramp up attacks on Saudi Arabia", DOA 06/12/19,
GMDI

Over the past four years, since the beginning of Saudi-led military
intervention in Yemen in March 2015, the conflict in the poorest Arab
nation has gone through various phases, with calamitous consequences for
Yemeni civilians. However, [in recent weeks, Houthi attacks against
military and civilian targets]{.underline} within Saudi territory
[**have markedly escalated**, which notably **coincided with amplifying
pressure from the United States** and its allies **on
Iran**]{.underline}, a key regional supporter of Yemen\'s Houthis. The
[**surge in Houthi attacks may be aimed at showing the US** and its
allies that **any conflict between them and Iran risks igniting a
regional war**]{.underline}, analysts told Al Jazeera. Others see the
attacks as asymmetric retaliation against US regional allies by Tehran,
which lacks the economic or diplomatic power to punish Washington in
response to US-led sanctions and \"maximum pressure\" campaign against
Iran. The US and some of its European and Middle Eastern allies have
accused Iran of supporting the Houthi rebels, including by providing
arms, in an effort to expand its influence in the Arabian Peninsula and
build a proxy force similar to the Lebanese Hezbollah that could serve
as a source of power and deterrence against its chief rival Saudi
Arabia. In January, the United Nations\' experts concluded in an 85-page
report to the Security Council that Tehran was illegally shipping fuel
to Yemen to finance their war effort. A year earlier, a UN panel had
criticised Iran for violating an arms embargo on Yemen by enabling
Houthis obtain Iranian missiles. Tehran has repeatedly dismissed these
allegations. In the latest of a consistent string of attacks on Saudi
positions, Houthi rebels hit a power station in Al Shuqaiq city in the
kingdom\'s southern province of Jizan with a \"cruise missile\", the
group\'s Al Masirah TV channel reported on Thursday. Reacting to the
incident, US Navy Commander Rebecca Rebarich said such attacks were \"a
significant cause for concern and \[put\] innocent lives at risk\". On
Monday, Houthis launched a drone assault against the Abha airport in
southern Saudi Arabia, less than a week after they targeted the airport
with a cruise missile, wounding 26 civilians. Saudi Abha airport Abha
Regional Airport was damaged after an attack by Yemen\'s Houthi rebels
\[File: Saudi Press Agency/AP\] In a significant escalation on May 14,
Houthis staged a number of drone attacks on the Aramco East-West
pipeline and oil stations deep within the Saudi territory, which caused
minor supply disruptions but highlighted an apparent leap in the Houthi
drone capabilities. \'Backing the dispossessed\' [\"The Saudi and
Emirati complicity in aiding and abetting tough US sanctions against
Iran is]{.underline}, to some extent, [driving this surge in Houthi
attacks]{.underline}. But [Tehran\'s support for Yemeni rebels is not
simply]{.underline} based on Iranian [geopolitical
interests]{.underline} and cannot be reduced to a personal revenge
against the Saudis,\" a Tehran-based intelligence analyst affiliated
with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) told Al Jazeera on
condition of anonymity. [\"It is also ideological and aimed at backing
the \'dispossessed\' of the world,]{.underline}\" the analyst added,
referring to Article 154 of the Iranian Constitution which stipulates
that the Islamic Republic would support the struggles of the oppressed
against the oppressors \"anywhere in the world\". [Houthis themselves
blame the \"Saudi aggression against our country\" for increased
assaults]{.underline} and their adverse implications for the Hodeidah
agreement, [insisting that they will continue attacks against civilian
airports and military sites]{.underline} - which rebels now see as
\"legitimate targets\" - [until the Saudi-led military
intervention,]{.underline} now in its fifth year,
[persists.]{.underline} On Wednesday, the Armed Conflict Location Event
Data Project (ACLED) - a non-governmental body that collects and
analyses data on political violence around the world - announced in a
new estimate that the Yemeni civil war has claimed at least 91,600
lives, excluding deaths caused by war-related humanitarian disasters
such as starvation and cholera. The report suggests that the Saudi-led
coalition and its allies are responsible for the majority of civilian
deaths. In a stark instance, two coalition air raids on a funeral in
Sanaa in October 2016 killed 155 and wounded 525 people. \"Houthi
attacks against Saudi targets come in response to daily coalition raids
on Yemen\'s hospitals, schools, infrastructure and innocent people as
well,\" Fatik al-Rodaini, Sanaa-based Yemeni journalist and founder of
the non-profit Mona Relief aid organisation, told Al Jazeera. \"They
regard this a right to respond to Saudi-led military campaign since
2015,\" al-Rodaini said, adding she sees no link between Houthi
retaliation on the one hand and Saudi-Emirati role in ratcheting up
US-led pressure against Iran on the other. Shifting war theatre The
uptick in Houthi assaults against Saudi positions and its possible link
with the growing economic and military pressure on Iran suggests that in
the event of a US-Iran conflict, Saudi Arabia may be a prime target of
Iranian missiles and Yemeni drones. Such an eventuality would further
set back Saudi military efforts to restore overthrown President
Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power and deny Tehran a strategic foothold in
the Arabian Peninsula. Houthis\' intensified military campaign against
the Saudi-led coalition has cast doubt on the plausibility of the
Hodeidah truce, brokered by the UN during negotiations between the
warring parties in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, in December. Under
the ceasefire deal, the Houthis agreed to hand over the control of
Hodeidah, Saleef and Ras Isa ports to \"local authorities in accordance
with Yemeni law\". \"While the administration of \[Iranian President
Hassan\] Rouhani was pushing the Houthis to accede to the Hodeidah
ceasefire, the IRGC wasn\'t happy with this course of action absent
proper concessions by the Arab coalition states,\" the IRGC-affiliated
analyst explained. \"After the Hodeidah accord, the rebels\' focal
theatre of operation shifted from Yemeni to Saudi territory.\" The
Houthis\' motive seems to be twofold: take the fight inside the Saudi
territory and inflict considerable damage on its infrastructure in
retaliation for \"daily aggression\" by the Saudi-led coalition, and
signal that growing pressure on Iran as the main backer of Houthis would
come at a price for Saudi national security. Arming the conflict Yet,
perhaps [the most underreported aspect of the Yemen war is the foreign
support provided in particular by the US]{.underline} and the United
Kingdom [in]{.underline} the form of [armaments, personnel and
expertise]{.underline}. In early April, Channel 4 aired an investigative
documentary - Britain\'s Hidden War - on the British role in the
Saudi-led intervention and \"the extent to which the war in Yemen is
made in Britain\". According to an employee of BAE Systems, the UK\'s
biggest defence contractor, \"[If we weren\'t there, in seven to 14
days, there wouldn\'t be a jet in the sky.]{.underline}\" BAE Systems
employs over 6,000 people on the ground in Saudi Arabia. \"These [bombs
that are being dropped on us are made in the UK, US, and
France]{.underline}, which are selling arms and providing intelligence
and aircraft refuelling services to Saudi Arabia. **[So if the
US]{.underline}** and the UK **[want this war to be over, it will be
over, it depends on them]{.underline}**,\" Ahmad Algohbari, a
Sanaa-based Yemeni journalist and founder of grassroots aid organisation
Yemen Hope Relief, told Al Jazeera. [\"They are **thus refuelling the
war**, and **as long as they do so the war will see no end,** and this
is a big problem because they do not care about our lives in Yemen. They
only care about building their economy and offering jobs to their own
people.\"]{.underline}

### A2: Weapons PICS- Generic 

#### Doesn't solve human rights advantage\-\--Saudi will use even non-lethal weapons to wage war in Yemen\-\--insufficient pressure for reform

[Weapons sales to Saudi Arabia have been particularly criticized due to
Riyadh's campaign in Yemen, in which countless civilians have lost their
lives.]{.underline} Moreover, Riyadh was also involved in the murder of
Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey last year. Furthermore, [even non-lethal
equipment can be utilized to commit human rights abuses]{.underline}.
[For example, the US has donated J8 jeeps]{.underline} (among other
equipment) [to the Guatemalan military to improve internal security
operations]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [President Jimmy Morales has
deployed his troops to harass the CICIG]{.underline} (International
Commission against Impunity in Guatemala), [and US diplomats have been
reportedly intimated]{.underline}, too. In response, several members of
the US Congress wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in
December 2018 to "urge the Department to take effective steps to ensure
that this situation be rectified." Critics of S.854 can argue that such
sales are important for the US weapons industry, which encompasses tens
of thousands of jobs, and that if Washington does not sell them, someone
else will. Indeed, SIPRI explains that the major weapons exporters after
the US are Russia, France, Germany, China, and the UK, in that
descending order[. However, the fact that other states are willing to
sell their military technology to a government known for committing
human rights abuses and other atrocities may be a financial argument,
but it is not a moral one]{.underline}. There are [already precedents
regarding this issue: Germany has suspended sales to Saudi Arabia over
Yemen,]{.underline} though Berlin reportedly wants to restart them.
S.854 is an attempt to improve the monitoring of US weapons transfers to
states that are proven human rights abusers or that support violent
criminal movements. As Win Without War's Kizer argues, "providing
weapons to countries that violate human rights, perpetrate war crimes,
and other violations of the rule of law is not in US national security
interests. S.854 recognizes this reality and ensures that there are
clear moral and national security considerations upheld in US arms
exports." The realm of the global arms trade is very complex as it
converges morality, national interests, financial interests, and
geopolitics. It will be important to monitor the future of S.854 and
what this means for the future of US weapons exports.
