#### What is the ATT (Arms Trade Treaty)?

[­­­­­Adopted by a majority]{.underline} vote [at the United
Nations]{.underline} General Assembly [in April 2013]{.underline} (154
in favour, 3 against, 23 abstentions), the ATT entered into force on 24
December 2014 once 50 states had ratified it. [There are 130 signatories
to the treaty, of which 94 are States Parties at the time of
writing]{.underline}. [It aims to "\[e\]stablish the highest possible
common international standards for regulating or improving the
regulation of the international trade in conventional arms" and
"\[p\]revent and eradicate the illicit trade inconventional arms and
prevent their diversion]{.underline}."5 To do this, [the treaty text
sets out the core provisions that States Parties must implement in their
national regulatory systems governing the transfer -- import, export,
transit, trans-shipment or brokering -- of weapons ranging from battle
tanks and combat aircraft, **to SALW**]{.underline}. [A set of
prohibitions based on existing international law stipulate that States
Parties must not authorise transfers if doing so would violate UN
Security Council arms embargoes or be used in genocide or war crimes. If
a transfer is not prohibited in this way, States Parties must conduct a
risk assessment against a series of factors, including human rights,
IHL, terrorism and transnational organized crime, to decide whether or
not to authorize exports.]{.underline}

There is a new normal in America: our government may shut down, but our
wars continue. [Congress may not be able to pass a budget, but the U.S.
military can still launch commando raids in Libya and Somalia, the
Afghan War can still be prosecuted, Italy can be garrisoned by American
troops]{.underline} (putting the "empire" back in Rome), Africa can be
used as an imperial playground (as in the late nineteenth century
"scramble for Africa," but with the U.S. and China doing the scrambling
this time around), and [[the military-industrial complex can still
dominate the world's **arms trade**.]{.mark} In the halls of Congress
and the Pentagon, [it's business as usual, if your definition of
"business" is the power and profits you get from constantly preparing
for and prosecuting wars around the world.]{.mark} "War is a
racket,"]{.underline} General Smedley Butler famously declared in 1935,
and even now it's hard to disagree with a man who had two Congressional
Medals of Honor to his credit and was intimately familiar with American
imperialism. War Is Politics, Right? Once upon a time, as a serving
officer in the U.S. Air Force, I was taught that Carl von Clausewitz had
defined war as a continuation of politics by other means. This
definition is, in fact, a simplification of his classic and complex
book, On War, written after his experiences fighting Napoleon in the
early nineteenth century. [The idea of war as a continuation of politics
is]{.underline} both moderately interesting and [dangerously misleading:
interesting because it connects war to political processes and suggests
that they should be fought for political goals; misleading because it
suggests that war is essentially rational and so
controllable.]{.underline} The fault here is not Clausewitz's, but the
American military's for misreading and oversimplifying him. Perhaps
another "Carl" might lend a hand when it comes to helping Americans
understand what war is really all about. I'm referring to Karl Marx, who
admired Clausewitz, notably for his idea that combat is to war what a
cash payment is to commerce. [However seldom combat]{.underline} (or
such payments) [may happen, they are the culmination and so the ultimate
arbiters of the process. [War]{.mark}, in other words[, is settled by
killing, a bloody transaction that echoes the exploitative exchanges of
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Marx found this idea to be both
suggestive and pregnant with meaning. So should we all. Following Marx,
[Americans ought to think about war]{.underline} not just as an extreme
exercise of politics, but also [as a continuation of exploitative
commerce by other means.]{.underline} Combat as commerce: there's more
in that than simple alliteration. [In the history of war, such
commercial transactions took many forms, whether as territory conquered,
spoils carted away, raw materials appropriated, or market share
gained**.**]{.underline} Consider American wars. [The War of
1812]{.underline} is sometimes portrayed as a minor dust-up with
Britain, involving the temporary occupation and burning of our capital,
but it really [was about crushing Indians on the frontier and grabbing
their land. The Mexican-American War was another land grab, this time
for the benefit of slaveholders. The Spanish-American War was a land
grab for]{.underline} those seeking [an American empire overseas, while
World War I was for making the world "safe for democracy"]{.underline}
--- [and]{.underline} for [American business interests
globally.]{.underline} Even World War II, a war necessary to stop Hitler
and Imperial Japan, witnessed the emergence of the U.S. as the arsenal
of democracy, the world's dominant power, and the new imperial stand-in
for a bankrupt British Empire. [Korea? Vietnam? Lots of profit for the
military-industrial complex and plenty of power for the Pentagon
establishment. Iraq, the Middle East, current adventures in Africa? Oil,
markets, natural resources, global dominance. In societal calamities
like war,]{.underline} there will always be winners and losers. But [the
clearest winners are often companies like Boeing and Dow Chemical, which
provided B-52 bombers and Agent Orange, respectively, to the U.S.
military in Vietnam. Such "arms merchants**"**]{.underline} --- an
older, more honest term than today's "defense contractor" --- [don't
have to pursue the hard sell, not when war and preparations for it have
become so permanently, inseparably intertwined with the American
economy, foreign policy, and our nation's identity as a rugged land of
"warriors" and "heroes"]{.underline} (more on that in a moment). War as
Disaster Capitalism Consider one more definition of war: not as politics
or even as commerce, but as societal catastrophe. Thinking this way, [we
can apply Naomi Klein's concepts of [the "shock doctrine" and "disaster
capitalism]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} to it. [[When such disasters occur,
there are **always** those who seek to turn a **profit**]{.mark}. Most
Americans are, however, discouraged from thinking about war this
way]{.underline} thanks to the power of what we call "patriotism" or, at
an extreme, "superpatriotism" when it applies to us, and the
significantly more negative "nationalism" or "ultra-nationalism" when it
appears in other countries. During wars, we're told to "support our
troops," to wave the flag, to put country first, to respect the
patriotic ideal of selfless service and redemptive sacrifice (even if
all but 1% of us are never expected to serve or sacrifice). We're
discouraged from reflecting on the uncomfortable fact that, as "our"
troops sacrifice and suffer, others in society are profiting big time.
Such thoughts are considered unseemly and unpatriotic. [[Pay no
attention to the war profiteers, who pass as perfectly respectable
companies]{.mark}. After all, any price is worth paying]{.underline} (or
profits worth offering up) [to contain the enemy --- not so long ago,
the red menace, but in the twenty-first century, the murderous
terrorist. Forever war is forever profitable. Think of the Lockheed
Martins of the world. In their commerce with the Pentagon, as well as
the militaries of other nations, they ultimately seek cash payment for
their weapons and a world in which such weaponry will be eternally
needed**.**]{.underline} In the pursuit of security or victory,
political leaders willingly pay their price. Call it a
Clausewitzian/Marxian feedback loop or the dialectic of Carl and Karl.
[It also represents the eternal marriage of combat and
commerce.]{.underline} If it doesn't catch all of what war is about, it
should at least remind us of the degree to which war as disaster
capitalism is driven by profit and power. For a synthesis, we need only
turn from Carl or Karl to Cal --- President Calvin Coolidge, that is.
"The business of America is business," he declared in the Roaring
Twenties. Almost a century later, [the business of America is war, even
if today's presidents are too polite to mention that the business is
booming.]{.underline} America's War Heroes as Commodities Many young
people today are, in fact, looking for a release from consumerism. In
seeking new identities, quite a few turn to the military. And it
provides. Recruits are hailed as warriors and warfighters, as heroes,
and not just within the military either, but by society at large. Yet in
joining the military and being celebrated for that act, our troops
paradoxically become yet another commodity, another consumable of the
state. Indeed, they become consumed by war and its violence. Their
compensation? To be packaged and marketed as the heroes of our
militarized moment. Steven Gardiner, a cultural anthropologist and U.S.
Army veteran, has written eloquently about what he calls the "heroic
masochism" of militarized settings and their allure for America's youth.
Put succinctly, in seeking to escape a consumerism that has lost its
meaning and find a release from dead-end jobs, many volunteers are
transformed into celebrants of violence, seekers and givers of pain, a
harsh reality Americans ignore as long as that violence is acted out
overseas against our enemies and local populations. Such "heroic"
identities, tied so closely to violence in war, often prove poorly
suited to peacetime settings. Frustration and demoralization devolve
into domestic violence and suicide. In an American society with ever
fewer meaningful peacetime jobs, exhibiting greater and greater
polarization of wealth and opportunity, the decisions of some veterans
to turn to or return to mind-numbing drugs of various sorts and
soul-stirring violence is tragically predictable. That it stems from
their exploitative commodification as so many heroic inflictors of
violence in our name is a reality most Americans are content to forget.
You May Not Be Interested in War, but War Is Interested in You As
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky pithily observed, "You may not be
interested in war, but war is interested in you." [[If war is combat and
commerce, calamity and commodity, it cannot be left to our political
leaders alone]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and certainly not to our
generals. [When it comes to war, however far from it we may seem to be,
we're all in our own ways customers and consumers.]{.underline} Some pay
a high price. Many pay a little. A few gain a lot. Keep an eye on those
few and you'll end up with a keener appreciation of what war is actually
all about. No wonder our leaders tell us not to worry our little heads
about our wars --- just support those troops, go shopping, and keep
waving that flag. If [patriotism is]{.underline} famously the last
refuge of the scoundrel, it's also [the first recourse of those seeking
to mobilize customers for the latest bloodletting exercise in combat as
commerce]{.underline}. Just remember: [in the grand bargain that is war,
it's their product and their profit.]{.underline} And that's no bargain
for America, or for that matter for the world.

#### That leads to Extinction

Jodi **Dean 15**, Professor of Political Theory at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, 2015, "Red, Black, and Green," Rethinking Marxism: A
Journal of Economics, Culture & Society, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 396-404

A defining characteristic of capitalism is the differentiation between
state and economy.2 More than an economic system for the production and
circulation of value, capitalism refers to a form of society (Marx 2008,
14). In contrast with, say, feudalism, capitalist society relies on the
differentiation of the economic system from the political system. That
state and economy are differentiated does not mean that they are
separate from one another. [States are deeply involved in economic life:
they issue]{.underline} and maintain [currencies, create and preserve
property and markets, devise and extend the policy infrastructure of
global trade]{.underline}, and so on. The differentiation between state
and economy also does not imply complete independence, as if states
themselves were not economic actors with, for example, massive
purchasing, employing, and investing power. Rather, under capitalism the
differentiation between state and economy points to different relations
to capital accumulation, with the state focused generally on the terms
and conditions of accumulation and the economy focused on the
circulatory processes of accumulation itself. Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin
(2012, 4) speak of the "relative autonomy" of capitalist states.
[Political logics]{.underline}, rationalities, or governmentalities (to
use Foucault's term) [are irreducible to economic considerations.
Capitalist states have capacities to act on behalf of the system as a
whole]{.underline}---[capacities anchored in an array of **institutions,
laws, and policies**]{.underline}. At the same time, they are
constrained by their dependence on capital accumulation. [[States secure
and reproduce capitalism]{.underline},]{.mark} whether by protecting
capitalists from themselves through taxes and regulatory oversight,
protecting capitalists from the people through aggressive policing and
surveillance, or protecting people from capitalists in those
increasingly frequent emergency responses that have taken the place of
planning and social welfare. [The state]{.underline}---particularly in
its contemporary extended, decentralized, and networked form---[gives
capitalism its durability. It responds to capitalism's inevitable
crises, **keeping the system running even when its components break
down**]{.underline}. Under globalized capitalism, an international
policy architecture aimed at securing capital flow provides massive
advantages to multinational banks and corporations. The structural
adjustment [[policies]{.underline}]{.mark} and austerity measures
[imposed by the IMF, World Bank, European Central Bank, and U.S.
Treasury **[determine]{.mark}**]{.underline} (although not fully or
exclusively) **[[the lives of billions]{.mark} of people]{.underline}**,
impacting basic social structures such as education and medical care,
property, markets for agricultural products, transportation, currency
value, energy, and the availability of potable water. [The viability of
[communism]{.mark}, as an egalitarian political and economic arrangement
anchored in the sovereignty of the people and in production based on
need[, **depends on seizing, dismantling, or redirecting this
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Naomi Klein (2014, 66--9) tells a story
that illustrates the limits the global trade architecture imposes on
local actors. In 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario announced the
Green Energy and Green Economy Act. Its goal was to shift Ontario away
from dependence on coal. As Klein explains, "The legislation created
what is known as a feed-in tariff program, which allowed renewable
energy providers to sell power back to the grid." A key element of the
plan was ensuring that "local municipalities, co-ops, and Indigenous
communities could all get into the renewable energy market" (67). This
was to be achieved by a provision requiring that a certain percentage of
materials and workforce come from Ontario. Although there were various
setbacks and complications, after several years the legislation seemed
to have been largely successful. That's when Japan and the EU went to
the World Bank with the complaint that the local materials and workforce
requirement discriminated against equipment producers outside Ontario.
The World Bank agreed; the buy local provisions were illegal. [[The
**absence of a powerful Left enables the political
Right**]{.underline}]{.mark} (in part by shifting what had been the
center). The [intensified inequality of the last forty years of
neoliberalism testifies to the impact of left political
defeat]{.underline}.3 [Neoliberalism's subjection of all of society to
its economic criteria]{.underline} of efficiency and competitiveness
[has been **carried out as a political project**]{.underline}.4 [**The
political system has been the instrument** through which neoliberalism
has dismantled the achievements of the welfare state, installed
competition in ever more domains]{.underline}, expanded the finance
sector, [and imposed austerity]{.underline}. **[This is the
setting]{.underline}**, then, [for my appeal to the Left to assemble
itself into a party]{.underline}. **[Key determinants of our lives occur
behind our backs]{.underline}**---currency valuations, monetary
policies, trade agreements, energy concessions, data harvesting. [[To
**insist**]{.mark} on a politics focused on isolating and archiving
[**singular micropractices**]{.mark} abstracted from their global
capitalist context [**obscures the workings of state and economy** as a
capitalist system, **hinders the identification of this system as the
site of ongoing harm**]{.mark} (exploitation, expropriation, and
injustice), [and **disperses political energies that could be more
effective if concentrated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More fundamentally, in
treating economic practices as the primary locus of left politics, [such
an insistence effaces the gap between politics and economics such that
**questions of strategy, of how to win, are displaced**]{.underline}.
Morrow and Brault supply a striking example of this effacement when they
ask, "What is communism for, if not to improve our everyday lives?"
[Communism]{.underline}, which previous generations rendered as the
world-historical struggle of the proletariat, [diminishes into yet
another **option for individual self-improvement**; the abolition of
exploitation, expropriation, and injustice replaced by economic
determinations of immediate satisfaction]{.underline}. As Ramsey rightly
notes, Healy similarly substitutes economic alternatives for political
antagonism. Two ideas voiced in the present discussion impress the
urgency of the need for a left party oriented toward communism: racism
(Buck 2015) and the Anthropocene (Healy 2015). [[Given anthropogenic
climate change, the stakes]{.mark} of contemporary politics
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[unimaginably high]{.mark}**. They
range from]{.underline} the [continued investment in extractive
industries]{.underline} and fossil fuels constitutive of the
carbon-combustion complex (see Oreskes and Conway 2014),
[to]{.underline} the dislocations accompanying [[mass migration in the
wake of floods and droughts to the **racist response of
states**]{.underline}]{.mark} outside what Christian Parenti (2011, 9)
calls the "Tropic of Chaos" (the band around the "belt of economically
and politically battered post-colonial states girding the planet's
mid-latitudes," where climate change is "beginning to hit hard"),
**[[all the way to human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That one
city, state, or country brings carbon emissions under control---while
certainly a step in the right direction---may be irrelevant from the
standpoint of overall warming. Perhaps its carbon-emitting industries
were shipped elsewhere. Perhaps another country chose to expand its own
drilling operations. Climate change forces us to acknowledge that we
can't build new worlds (Helepololei). [We live in one world, the heating
up of which threatens humans and other species.]{.underline} [**[Not all
communities, economies, or ways of life are
compatible]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Those premised on industries and
practices that continue to contribute to planetary warming have to
change significantly, and soon. **[Forcing that change is the political
challenge of our time]{.underline}**. [Given the persistence of
**racialized violence** and the operation of the state as an instrument
for the maintenance]{.underline} not only of capitalist modes of
production but also and concomitantly [of racialized hierarchy, the
challenges of **organizing politically across issues and identities**
are almost insurmountably daunting. **No wonder the Left resorts to
moralism and self-care instead**. It's **easier to catalog difference
than it is to build up a Left strong enough to exercise
power**]{.underline}, especially [given the traversal of state power by
transnational corporations]{.underline}, trade, and treaties.
[It's]{.underline} also [**easier to go along with the dominant ideology
of individualism**, which enjoins us first and foremost to look after
ourselves, than it is to **put ourselves aside and focus on formulating
a strategy for using collective power**]{.underline} [to occupy,
reconfigure, and redirect institutions at multiple levels]{.underline}.
Herde again, [**not every vision of community is compatible with every
other**. Those premised on fantasies of racial, religious, ethnic, or
linguistic purity directly oppose those premised on
diversity]{.underline}. Those premised on reproducing structures of
class hierarchy directly oppose those insisting on equality.
[If]{.underline} something like [a party of the radical
Left]{.underline} can stretch beyond Greece and Spain, if it [can be
imagined in North America, it will only be possible as a combination of
communism, antiracism, and climate activism]{.underline}. I use "red,
black, and green" as a heuristic for the coalition of concerns necessary
for such a party. I invoke the heuristic here to double down against
critics who prefer a thousand alternatives to the party form. **[A
thousand alternatives]{.underline}** (see Healy 2015) [**is no
alternative**. It leaves the political system we have]{.underline}---the
one [that puts all its force behind the preservation of capitalist class
interests---**intact**]{.underline}. Some **[ideas need to be chosen,
systematized into a program, and defended]{.underline}**.

#### The alternative is to affirm the form of the party

CM: Great to have you on the show.¶ Let's start with Occupy. What, to
you, explains the impact that the Tea Party had on Republicans, relative
to the impact that Occupy seems to have had on the Democratic Party? All
of the sudden there were "Tea Party Republicans." There weren't "Occupy
Democrats."¶ JD: That's a good point. [The Tea Party]{.underline} took
the Republican Party as its target. They [decided that their goal was
going to be to influence the political system]{.underline} by getting
people elected and basically [by trying to take over]{.underline} part
of [government. That's why they were able to have]{.underline} good
[effects. They didn't regard the mainstream political process as
something irrelevant to their concerns. They thought of it as something
to seize]{.underline}.¶ [The problem with many]{.underline}---but not
all---[[leftists in the US is that they think the political process is
so corrupted that we have to completely refuse it, and **leave it
altogether**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Tea Party decided to act as an
organized militant force, and [too much of the US left]{.underline} (we
saw this in the wake of Occupy) [has thought that to be "militant" means
to refuse and **disperse and become fragmented**]{.underline}.¶ CM: So
what explains the left turning its back on the collective action of a
political party? It would seem like a political party would fit into
what the left would historically want: an apparatus that can organize
collective action.¶ JD: [There are multiple things. First, the fear of
success]{.underline}: the left has learned from the excesses of the
twentieth century. [Where Communist]{.underline} and socialist [parties
"succeeded," there was violence]{.underline} and purges and repression.
One reason [the left has turned its back]{.underline} is [because of
this historical experience]{.underline} of state socialism. [And we have
taken that to mean that we should not ever have a state. I think that's
the wrong answer. That we]{.underline}---as the left---[made a mistake
with some regimes does not have to mean that we can never
learn]{.underline}.¶ [Another reason]{.underline} that th[e left has
turned its back on the party form has been the important criticism of
twentieth century parties that have been too white, too masculine,
potentially homophobic; parties that have operated in intensely
hierarchical fashion. **Those criticisms are real.** [**But rather than
saying we can't have a party form because that's just what a party does,
why not make a party that is not repressive** and does not
exclude]{.mark} or diminish people on the basis of sex, race, or
sexuality?]{.underline}¶ So we've got at least two historical problems
that have made people very reluctant to use the party. I also think
that, whether or not you mark it as 1968 or 1989, [the left's embrace of
cultural individualism and the free flow of personal experimentation has
made it critical of discipline and]{.underline} critical of
[collectivity. But]{.underline} I think [[**that's just a capitalist
sellout**. Saying everybody should just "do their own thing" is just
**going in the direction of the dominant culture**. That is actually not
a left position at]{.mark} all]{.underline}.¶ CM: So does [identity
politics undermine collectivism]{.underline}? [And]{.underline} did that
end up [lead]{.underline}ing [to fragmentation and a weakening of the
left]{.underline}? Because there are a lot of people we've had on the
show---and one person in particular, Thomas Frank---who say that there
is no left in the United States.¶ JD: First I want to say that I
disagree with the claim that there is no left. In fact, I think that
"the left" is that group that keeps denying its own existence. We're
always saying that we're the ones who don't exist. But the right thinks
that we exist. That's what is so fantastic, actually. Did you see the
New York Post screaming that Bernie Sanders is really a communist?
Great! They're really still afraid of communists! And it's people on the
left who say, "Oh, no, we're not here at all!"¶ The left denies its own
existence and it denies its own collectivity. Now, is identity politics
to blame? Maybe it's better to say that [identity politics has been a
symptom of the pressure of capitalism. Capitalism has operated in the US
by exacerbating racial differences]{.underline}. That has to be
addressed on the left, and [the left has been addressing that.
But]{.underline} we haven't been addressing it in a way that recognizes
how racism operates to support capitalism. Instead, [we've made it too
much about identity rather than as an element in building collective
solidarity]{.underline}.¶ I'm trying to find a way around this to
express that [identity politics has been important but it's reached its
limits. **Identity politics can't go any further insofar as it denies
the impact of capitalism**]{.underline}. An identity politics that just
rests on itself is nothing but liberalism. [Like all of the sudden
everything will be better if black people and white people are equally
exploited? What if black people and white people say, ["**No, we don't
want to live in a society based on
exploitation?**]{.mark}"]{.underline}¶ CM: You were saying that the left
denies its own collectivity. Is that only in the US? Is that unique to
the US culture of the left?¶ JD: That's a really important question, and
I'm not sure. Traveling in Europe, I see two different things. On the
one hand I see a broad left discussion that is, in part, mediated
through social media and is pretty generational---people in their
twenties and thirties or younger---and that [there's a general feeling
about the problem of collectivity, the problem of building something
with cohesion]{.underline}, and a temptation to just emphasize
multiplicity. You see this everywhere. Everybody worries about this, as
far as what I've seen.¶ On the other hand, there are countries whose
political culture has embraced parties much more, and fights politically
through parties. Like Greece, for example---and we've seen the ups and
downs with Syriza over the last two years. And Spain also. Because they
have a parliamentary system where small parties can actually get in the
mix and have a political effect---in ways that our two-party system
excludes---the European context allows for more enthusiasm for the party
as a form for politics.¶ But there's still a lot of disagreement on the
far left about whether or not the party form is useful, and shouldn't we
in fact retreat and have multiple actions and artistic events---you
know, the whole alter-globalization framework. That's still alive in a
lot of places. CM: You mentioned the structure of the US electoral
system doesn't allow for a political party to necessarily be the
solution for a group like Occupy. Is that one of the reasons that
activists dismiss the party structure as something that could help move
their agenda forward?¶ JD: [We can think about the Black Panther Party
as a neat example]{.underline} in the US context: [A party which was
operating not primarily to win elections but to galvanize social
power]{.underline}. That's an interesting way of thinking about what
else parties can do in the US.¶ [Or we can think about parties in terms
of local elections]{.underline}. Socialist Alternative has been doing
really neat work all over the country, organizing around local elections
with people running as socialist candidates not within a mainstream
party. I think that even as we come up against the limits of a two-party
system, we can also begin to think better about local and regional
elections.¶ The left really likes that old saw: "Think Globally, Act
Locally." And then it rejects parties---even though [political parties
are, historically, forms]{.underline} that do that, [that actually
scale, that operate on multiple levels as organizations]{.underline}.¶
That we have a two-party system makes sense as an excuse why [people
haven't used left parties very well in the US, but that doesn't have to
be the case]{.underline}.¶ [And]{.underline} one more thing: [there is a
ton of sectarianism in the far left parties that exist]{.underline}.
Many still fight battles that go back to the twenties, thirties,
forties, fifties, and haven't let that go. [That has to
change]{.underline}. We don't need that kind of sectarian purity right
now.¶ CM: You ask the question, "How do we move from the inert mass to
organized activists?" You mention how you were at Occupy Wall Street;
you write about being there on 15 October 2011 as the massive crowd
filled New York's Times Square. And you mention this one young speaker,
and he addresses the crowd; they're deciding if they should move on to
Washington Square Park or not, because they need to go somewhere where
there are better facilities. You then quote the speaker saying, "We can
take this park. We can take this park tonight. We can also take this
park another night. Not everyone may be ready tonight. Each person has
to make their own autonomous decision. No one can decide for you. You
have to decide for yourself. Everyone is an autonomous individual."¶ Did
that kind of [individualism kill Occupy Wall Street from the
start]{.underline}?¶ JD: Yeah, I think so. A lot of times I blame the
[rhetorics of consensus and horizontalism]{.underline}, but both of
those [are rooted in an individualism that says politics must begin with
each individual, their interests, their experience, their positions, and
so on. As collectivity forms---which is not easy when everyone's
beginning from their individual position---what starts to happen is that
**people** start **look**ing **for how their exact experiences** and
interests **are not being recognized**]{.underline}.¶ I think that [the
left has given in too much to this assumption that politics begins with
an individual]{.underline}. That's a liberal assumption. [Leftists,
historically, begin with the assumption that politics begins in groups.
And]{.underline} for the left in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
[the operative group is class. Class]{.underline} is what [determines
where our political interests come from]{.underline}.¶ I try to do
everything I can in the book [to dismantle the assumption]{.underline}
that politics, particularly [left politics, should begin with the
individual]{.underline}. Instead I want people thinking about how [the
individual is a fiction, and a really oppressive fiction at
that]{.underline}. And one that's actually, conveniently, falling
apart.¶ CM: You write about Occupy Wall Street having been an opening
but having had no continuing momentum. You mention that the party could
add that needed momentum. That's one of the things that parties can do.
[The structure of the party can continue momentum and keep the opening
alive]{.underline}.¶ When you say that a party could be a solution for a
movement like Occupy, you don't mean the Democratic Party, do you?¶ JD:
I've got a lot of layers on this question. My first answer is that no, I
really mean the Communist Party. My friends call this "Jodi's Fantasy
Revolutionary Party" as a joke, because [the kind of Communist Party I
take as my model may not be real, or may have only existed for a year
and a half in Brooklyn in the thirties]{.underline}. And I don't mean
the real-existing Communist Party in the US now, which still exists and
basically endorses Democrats.¶ My idea is to think in terms of how [[we
can imagine the Communist Party again as a force---what it could be like
if all of our left activist groups and small sectarian parties decided
to come together in a new radical left party]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ So
no, I don't envision the Democratic Party as being that. That's not at
all what I have in mind. [I'm thinking of a radical left party to which
elections are incidental]{.underline}. Elections might be means for
organizing, but [the goal isn't just being elected. [**The goal is
overthrowing capitalism**. The goal is **being able to build a communist
society as capitalism crumbles**]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Second, [it
could be the case---as a matter of tactics on the ground in particular
contexts---that working for a Democratic candidate might be
useful]{.underline}. It could be the case that trying to take over a
local Democratic committee in order to get communist/socialist/radical
left candidates elected could also be useful. [But]{.underline} I don't
see the goal as taking over the Democratic Party. [That's way too
limited a goal, and it's a goal that presupposes the continuation of the
system we have, rather than its overthrow]{.underline}.¶ CM: But how
difficult would it be for a Communist Party to emerge free of its past
associations with the Soviet Union? Can we even use the word "communist"
or is it impossibly taboo?¶ JD: We have to recognize that the right is
still scared of communism. That means the term is still powerful. That
means it still has the ability to instill fear in its enemies. I think
that's an argument for keeping the word "communism."¶ It's also amazing
that close to half of Iowa participants in the caucuses say that they
are socialist. Four or five years ago, people were saying socialism is
dead in the US. No one could even say the word. So I actually think
holding on to the word "communism" is useful not only because our
enemies are worried about communism, but also because it helps make the
socialists seem really, really mainstream, and that's good. We don't
want socialism to seem like something that only happens in Sweden. We
want it to seem like that's what America should have at a bare minimum.¶
One last thing about the history of communism: [every political ideology
that has infused a state form has done awful things]{.underline}. For
the most part, if people like the ideology, they either let the awful
things slide, or they use the ideology to criticize the awful things
that the state does. We can do the same thing with communism. It's
helpful to recognize that [the countries we understand to have
been]{.underline} ruled by [Communist]{.underline} Parties [were never
really communist---they didn't even claim to have achieved communism
themselves]{.underline}. We can say that [state socialism made these
mistakes, and in so doing was betraying communist ideals]{.underline}.¶
I don't think we need to abandon these terms or come up with new ones. I
think we need to use the power that they have. And people recognize
this, which is what makes it exciting.¶ CM: You write, "Some
contemporary crowd observers claim the crowd for democracy. They see in
the amassing of thousands a democratic insistence, a demand to be heard
and included. In the context of communicative capitalism, however, the
crowd exceeds democracy.¶ "In the 21st century, dominant nation-states
exercise power as democracies. They bomb and invade as democracies, 'for
democracy's sake.' International political bodies legitimize themselves
as democratic, as do the contradictory and tangled media practices of
communicative capitalism. When crowds amass in opposition, they pose
themselves against democratic practices, systems, and bodies. To claim
the crowd for democracy fails to register this change in the political
setting of the crowd."¶ So are crowds today, the protesters today,
opposed to democracy? Or are they opposed to the current state of, let's
say, representative democracy?¶ JD: Let's think about our basic
environment. By "our," now, I mean basically English-speaking people who
use the internet and are listening to the radio and live in societies
like the United States. In our environment, what we hear is that we live
in democracy. We hear this all the time. We hear that the network media
makes democratic exchange possible, that a free press is democracy, that
we've got elections and that's democracy.¶ [When crowds
amass]{.underline} in this setting, if they are just at a football game,
[it's not a political statement. Even at a march]{.underline} (fully
permitted) that's [registering opposition to the invasion of
Iraq]{.underline}, for example, [or concern about the
climate]{.underline}---all of those things are within the general
environment of "democracy," and [they don't oppose the system. They
don't register as opposition to the system. They're just saying that we
want our view on this or that issue to count]{.underline}.¶
[But]{.underline} the way that crowds have been amassing over the last
four or five years---Occupy Wall Street is one example, but the Red
Square debt movement in Canada is another; some of the more militant
strikes of nurses and teachers are too---has been to say, "Look, the
process that we have that's been called democratic? It is not. We want
to change that."¶ It's not that we are anti-democratic. It's that
democracy is too limiting a term to register our opposition. [We want
something more. We want actual equality]{.underline}. Democracy is too
limiting. The reason it's too limiting is we live in a context that
understands itself as "democratic." So democracy as a political claim,
in my language, can't "register the gap that the crowd is inscribing."
It can't register real division or opposition. Democracy is just more of
what we have.¶ CM: We are so dependent. We use social media so much, we
use Facebook so much, we use so many of these avenues of what you call
communicative capitalism so much. How can we oppose or reject this
system without hurting ourselves and our ability to communicate our
message to each other? Can we just go on strike? Can we become the
owners of the means of communicative production?¶ JD: One of the ways
that Marxism historically has understood the political problems faced by
workers is our total entrapment and embeddedness in the capitalist
system. What makes a strike so courageous is that workers are shooting
themselves in the foot. They're not earning their wage for a time, as a
way to put pressure on the capitalist owner of the workplace.¶ What does
that mean under communicative capitalism? Does it mean that we have to
shoot ourselves in the foot by completely extracting ourselves from all
of the instruments of communication? Or does it mean that we change our
attitude towards communication? Or does it mean that we develop our own
means of communication?¶ There's a whole range here. I'm not a Luddite.
I don't think the way we're going to bring down capitalism is by
quitting Facebook. I think that's a little bit absurd. I think what
makes more sense is to think of how [[we could use the tools we have to
bring down the master's house. We can consolidate our message
together]{.mark}. We can get a better sense of how many we are. We can
develop common modes of thinking. [We can distribute organizing
materials for the revolutionary party]{.mark}]{.underline}[.¶]{.mark} I
don't think that an extractive approach to our situation in
communicative media is the right one. I think it's got to be more
tactical. How do we use the tools we have, and how do we find ways to
seize the means of communication? This would mean the collectivization
of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and using those apparatuses. But that would
probably have to be day two of the revolution.¶ CM: Jodi, I've got one
last question for you, and it's the Question from Hell, the question we
might hate to ask, you might hate to answer, or our audience is going to
hate the response.¶ How much did the narrative that Occupy created, of
the 99% and the 1%, undermine a of collectivity? Because it doesn't
include everyone...¶ JD: [Division is crucial. Collectivity is never
everyone]{.underline}. What this narrative did was produce [the divided
collectivity that we need]{.underline}. It's great to [undermine
the]{.underline} ~~stupid~~ [myth of American unity]{.underline}, "The
country has to pull together" and all that crap. It's fantastic that
[Occupy Wall Street asserted collectivity through division. This is
class conflict. This says there is not a unified society. [Collectivity
is the collectivity of us against them. It produced the proper
collectivity: **an antagonistic one**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is a new normal in America: our government may shut down, but our
wars continue. [Congress may not be able to pass a budget, but the U.S.
military can still launch commando raids in Libya and Somalia, the
Afghan War can still be prosecuted, Italy can be garrisoned by American
troops]{.underline} (putting the "empire" back in Rome), Africa can be
used as an imperial playground (as in the late nineteenth century
"scramble for Africa," but with the U.S. and China doing the scrambling
this time around), and [[the military-industrial complex can still
dominate the world's **arms trade**.]{.mark} In the halls of Congress
and the Pentagon, [it's business as usual, if your definition of
"business" is the power and profits you get from constantly preparing
for and prosecuting wars around the world.]{.mark} "War is a
racket,"]{.underline} General Smedley Butler famously declared in 1935,
and even now it's hard to disagree with a man who had two Congressional
Medals of Honor to his credit and was intimately familiar with American
imperialism. War Is Politics, Right? Once upon a time, as a serving
officer in the U.S. Air Force, I was taught that Carl von Clausewitz had
defined war as a continuation of politics by other means. This
definition is, in fact, a simplification of his classic and complex
book, On War, written after his experiences fighting Napoleon in the
early nineteenth century. [The idea of war as a continuation of politics
is]{.underline} both moderately interesting and [dangerously misleading:
interesting because it connects war to political processes and suggests
that they should be fought for political goals; misleading because it
suggests that war is essentially rational and so
controllable.]{.underline} The fault here is not Clausewitz's, but the
American military's for misreading and oversimplifying him. Perhaps
another "Carl" might lend a hand when it comes to helping Americans
understand what war is really all about. I'm referring to Karl Marx, who
admired Clausewitz, notably for his idea that combat is to war what a
cash payment is to commerce. [However seldom combat]{.underline} (or
such payments) [may happen, they are the culmination and so the ultimate
arbiters of the process. [War]{.mark}, in other words[, is settled by
killing, a bloody transaction that echoes the exploitative exchanges of
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Marx found this idea to be both
suggestive and pregnant with meaning. So should we all. Following Marx,
[Americans ought to think about war]{.underline} not just as an extreme
exercise of politics, but also [as a continuation of exploitative
commerce by other means.]{.underline} Combat as commerce: there's more
in that than simple alliteration. [In the history of war, such
commercial transactions took many forms, whether as territory conquered,
spoils carted away, raw materials appropriated, or market share
gained**.**]{.underline} Consider American wars. [The War of
1812]{.underline} is sometimes portrayed as a minor dust-up with
Britain, involving the temporary occupation and burning of our capital,
but it really [was about crushing Indians on the frontier and grabbing
their land. The Mexican-American War was another land grab, this time
for the benefit of slaveholders. The Spanish-American War was a land
grab for]{.underline} those seeking [an American empire overseas, while
World War I was for making the world "safe for democracy"]{.underline}
--- [and]{.underline} for [American business interests
globally.]{.underline} Even World War II, a war necessary to stop Hitler
and Imperial Japan, witnessed the emergence of the U.S. as the arsenal
of democracy, the world's dominant power, and the new imperial stand-in
for a bankrupt British Empire. [Korea? Vietnam? Lots of profit for the
military-industrial complex and plenty of power for the Pentagon
establishment. Iraq, the Middle East, current adventures in Africa? Oil,
markets, natural resources, global dominance. In societal calamities
like war,]{.underline} there will always be winners and losers. But [the
clearest winners are often companies like Boeing and Dow Chemical, which
provided B-52 bombers and Agent Orange, respectively, to the U.S.
military in Vietnam. Such "arms merchants**"**]{.underline} --- an
older, more honest term than today's "defense contractor" --- [don't
have to pursue the hard sell, not when war and preparations for it have
become so permanently, inseparably intertwined with the American
economy, foreign policy, and our nation's identity as a rugged land of
"warriors" and "heroes"]{.underline} (more on that in a moment). War as
Disaster Capitalism Consider one more definition of war: not as politics
or even as commerce, but as societal catastrophe. Thinking this way, [we
can apply Naomi Klein's concepts of [the "shock doctrine" and "disaster
capitalism]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} to it. [[When such disasters occur,
there are **always** those who seek to turn a **profit**]{.mark}. Most
Americans are, however, discouraged from thinking about war this
way]{.underline} thanks to the power of what we call "patriotism" or, at
an extreme, "superpatriotism" when it applies to us, and the
significantly more negative "nationalism" or "ultra-nationalism" when it
appears in other countries. During wars, we're told to "support our
troops," to wave the flag, to put country first, to respect the
patriotic ideal of selfless service and redemptive sacrifice (even if
all but 1% of us are never expected to serve or sacrifice). We're
discouraged from reflecting on the uncomfortable fact that, as "our"
troops sacrifice and suffer, others in society are profiting big time.
Such thoughts are considered unseemly and unpatriotic. [[Pay no
attention to the war profiteers, who pass as perfectly respectable
companies]{.mark}. After all, any price is worth paying]{.underline} (or
profits worth offering up) [to contain the enemy --- not so long ago,
the red menace, but in the twenty-first century, the murderous
terrorist. Forever war is forever profitable. Think of the Lockheed
Martins of the world. In their commerce with the Pentagon, as well as
the militaries of other nations, they ultimately seek cash payment for
their weapons and a world in which such weaponry will be eternally
needed**.**]{.underline} In the pursuit of security or victory,
political leaders willingly pay their price. Call it a
Clausewitzian/Marxian feedback loop or the dialectic of Carl and Karl.
[It also represents the eternal marriage of combat and
commerce.]{.underline} If it doesn't catch all of what war is about, it
should at least remind us of the degree to which war as disaster
capitalism is driven by profit and power. For a synthesis, we need only
turn from Carl or Karl to Cal --- President Calvin Coolidge, that is.
"The business of America is business," he declared in the Roaring
Twenties. Almost a century later, [the business of America is war, even
if today's presidents are too polite to mention that the business is
booming.]{.underline} America's War Heroes as Commodities Many young
people today are, in fact, looking for a release from consumerism. In
seeking new identities, quite a few turn to the military. And it
provides. Recruits are hailed as warriors and warfighters, as heroes,
and not just within the military either, but by society at large. Yet in
joining the military and being celebrated for that act, our troops
paradoxically become yet another commodity, another consumable of the
state. Indeed, they become consumed by war and its violence. Their
compensation? To be packaged and marketed as the heroes of our
militarized moment. Steven Gardiner, a cultural anthropologist and U.S.
Army veteran, has written eloquently about what he calls the "heroic
masochism" of militarized settings and their allure for America's youth.
Put succinctly, in seeking to escape a consumerism that has lost its
meaning and find a release from dead-end jobs, many volunteers are
transformed into celebrants of violence, seekers and givers of pain, a
harsh reality Americans ignore as long as that violence is acted out
overseas against our enemies and local populations. Such "heroic"
identities, tied so closely to violence in war, often prove poorly
suited to peacetime settings. Frustration and demoralization devolve
into domestic violence and suicide. In an American society with ever
fewer meaningful peacetime jobs, exhibiting greater and greater
polarization of wealth and opportunity, the decisions of some veterans
to turn to or return to mind-numbing drugs of various sorts and
soul-stirring violence is tragically predictable. That it stems from
their exploitative commodification as so many heroic inflictors of
violence in our name is a reality most Americans are content to forget.
You May Not Be Interested in War, but War Is Interested in You As
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky pithily observed, "You may not be
interested in war, but war is interested in you." [[If war is combat and
commerce, calamity and commodity, it cannot be left to our political
leaders alone]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and certainly not to our
generals. [When it comes to war, however far from it we may seem to be,
we're all in our own ways customers and consumers.]{.underline} Some pay
a high price. Many pay a little. A few gain a lot. Keep an eye on those
few and you'll end up with a keener appreciation of what war is actually
all about. No wonder our leaders tell us not to worry our little heads
about our wars --- just support those troops, go shopping, and keep
waving that flag. If [patriotism is]{.underline} famously the last
refuge of the scoundrel, it's also [the first recourse of those seeking
to mobilize customers for the latest bloodletting exercise in combat as
commerce]{.underline}. Just remember: [in the grand bargain that is war,
it's their product and their profit.]{.underline} And that's no bargain
for America, or for that matter for the world.

#### That leads to Extinction

Jodi **Dean 15**, Professor of Political Theory at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, 2015, "Red, Black, and Green," Rethinking Marxism: A
Journal of Economics, Culture & Society, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 396-404

A defining characteristic of capitalism is the differentiation between
state and economy.2 More than an economic system for the production and
circulation of value, capitalism refers to a form of society (Marx 2008,
14). In contrast with, say, feudalism, capitalist society relies on the
differentiation of the economic system from the political system. That
state and economy are differentiated does not mean that they are
separate from one another. [States are deeply involved in economic life:
they issue]{.underline} and maintain [currencies, create and preserve
property and markets, devise and extend the policy infrastructure of
global trade]{.underline}, and so on. The differentiation between state
and economy also does not imply complete independence, as if states
themselves were not economic actors with, for example, massive
purchasing, employing, and investing power. Rather, under capitalism the
differentiation between state and economy points to different relations
to capital accumulation, with the state focused generally on the terms
and conditions of accumulation and the economy focused on the
circulatory processes of accumulation itself. Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin
(2012, 4) speak of the "relative autonomy" of capitalist states.
[Political logics]{.underline}, rationalities, or governmentalities (to
use Foucault's term) [are irreducible to economic considerations.
Capitalist states have capacities to act on behalf of the system as a
whole]{.underline}---[capacities anchored in an array of **institutions,
laws, and policies**]{.underline}. At the same time, they are
constrained by their dependence on capital accumulation. [[States secure
and reproduce capitalism]{.underline},]{.mark} whether by protecting
capitalists from themselves through taxes and regulatory oversight,
protecting capitalists from the people through aggressive policing and
surveillance, or protecting people from capitalists in those
increasingly frequent emergency responses that have taken the place of
planning and social welfare. [The state]{.underline}---particularly in
its contemporary extended, decentralized, and networked form---[gives
capitalism its durability. [It responds to capitalism's inevitable
crises, **keeping the system running even when its components break
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under globalized capitalism, an
international policy architecture aimed at securing capital flow
provides massive advantages to multinational banks and corporations. The
structural adjustment [[policies]{.underline}]{.mark} and austerity
measures [imposed by the IMF, World Bank, European Central Bank, and
U.S. Treasury **[determine]{.mark}**]{.underline} (although not fully or
exclusively) **[[the lives of billions]{.mark} of people]{.underline}**,
impacting basic social structures such as education and medical care,
property, markets for agricultural products, transportation, currency
value, energy, and the availability of potable water. [[The viability of
communism, as an egalitarian political and economic arrangement anchored
in the sovereignty of the people and in production based on need,
**depends on seizing, dismantling, or redirecting this
system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Naomi Klein (2014, 66--9) tells a story
that illustrates the limits the global trade architecture imposes on
local actors. In 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario announced the
Green Energy and Green Economy Act. Its goal was to shift Ontario away
from dependence on coal. As Klein explains, "The legislation created
what is known as a feed-in tariff program, which allowed renewable
energy providers to sell power back to the grid." A key element of the
plan was ensuring that "local municipalities, co-ops, and Indigenous
communities could all get into the renewable energy market" (67). This
was to be achieved by a provision requiring that a certain percentage of
materials and workforce come from Ontario. Although there were various
setbacks and complications, after several years the legislation seemed
to have been largely successful. That's when Japan and the EU went to
the World Bank with the complaint that the local materials and workforce
requirement discriminated against equipment producers outside Ontario.
The World Bank agreed; the buy local provisions were illegal. [[The
**absence of a powerful Left enables the political
Right**]{.underline}]{.mark} (in part by shifting what had been the
center). The [intensified inequality of the last forty years of
neoliberalism testifies to the impact of left political
defeat]{.underline}.3 [Neoliberalism's subjection of all of society to
its economic criteria]{.underline} of efficiency and competitiveness
[has been **carried out as a political project**]{.underline}.4 [**The
political system has been the instrument** through which neoliberalism
has dismantled the achievements of the welfare state, installed
competition in ever more domains]{.underline}, expanded the finance
sector, [and imposed austerity]{.underline}. **[This is the
setting]{.underline}**, then, [for my appeal to the Left to assemble
itself into a party]{.underline}. **[Key determinants of our lives occur
behind our backs]{.underline}**---currency valuations, monetary
policies, trade agreements, energy concessions, data harvesting. [[To
**insist**]{.mark} on a politics focused on isolating and archiving
[**singular micropractices**]{.mark} abstracted from their global
capitalist context [**obscures the workings of state and economy** as a
capitalist system, **hinders the identification of this system as the
site of ongoing harm**]{.mark} (exploitation, expropriation, and
injustice), [and **disperses political energies that could be more
effective if concentrated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More fundamentally, in
treating economic practices as the primary locus of left politics, [such
an insistence effaces the gap between politics and economics such that
**questions of strategy, of how to win, are displaced**]{.underline}.
Morrow and Brault supply a striking example of this effacement when they
ask, "What is communism for, if not to improve our everyday lives?"
[[Communism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which previous generations rendered as
the world-historical struggle of the proletariat, [[diminishes into yet
another **option for individual self-improvement**; the abolition of
exploitation, expropriation, and injustice replaced by economic
determinations of immediate satisfaction]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Ramsey
rightly notes, Healy similarly substitutes economic alternatives for
political antagonism. Two ideas voiced in the present discussion impress
the urgency of the need for a left party oriented toward communism:
racism (Buck 2015) and the Anthropocene (Healy 2015). [[Given
anthropogenic climate change, the stakes]{.mark} of contemporary
politics [are]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[unimaginably
high]{.mark}**. They range from]{.underline} the [continued investment
in extractive industries]{.underline} and fossil fuels constitutive of
the carbon-combustion complex (see Oreskes and Conway 2014),
[to]{.underline} the dislocations accompanying [[mass migration in the
wake of floods and droughts to the **racist response of
states**]{.underline}]{.mark} outside what Christian Parenti (2011, 9)
calls the "Tropic of Chaos" (the band around the "belt of economically
and politically battered post-colonial states girding the planet's
mid-latitudes," where climate change is "beginning to hit hard"),
**[[all the way to human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That one
city, state, or country brings carbon emissions under control---while
certainly a step in the right direction---may be irrelevant from the
standpoint of overall warming. Perhaps its carbon-emitting industries
were shipped elsewhere. Perhaps another country chose to expand its own
drilling operations. Climate change forces us to acknowledge that we
can't build new worlds (Helepololei). [We live in one world, the heating
up of which threatens humans and other species.]{.underline} [**[Not all
communities, economies, or ways of life are
compatible]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Those premised on industries and
practices that continue to contribute to planetary warming have to
change significantly, and soon. **[Forcing that change is the political
challenge of our time]{.underline}**. [Given the persistence of
**racialized violence** and the operation of the state as an instrument
for the maintenance]{.underline} not only of capitalist modes of
production but also and concomitantly [of racialized hierarchy, the
challenges of **organizing politically across issues and identities**
are almost insurmountably daunting. **No wonder the Left resorts to
moralism and self-care instead**. It's **easier to catalog difference
than it is to build up a Left strong enough to exercise
power**]{.underline}, especially [given the traversal of state power by
transnational corporations]{.underline}, trade, and treaties.
[It's]{.underline} also [**easier to go along with the dominant ideology
of individualism**, which enjoins us first and foremost to look after
ourselves, than it is to **put ourselves aside and focus on formulating
a strategy for using collective power** to occupy, reconfigure, and
redirect institutions at multiple levels]{.underline}. Herde again,
[**not every vision of community is compatible with every other**. Those
premised on fantasies of racial, religious, ethnic, or linguistic purity
directly oppose those premised on diversity]{.underline}. Those premised
on reproducing structures of class hierarchy directly oppose those
insisting on equality. [If]{.underline} something like [a party of the
radical Left]{.underline} can stretch beyond Greece and Spain, if it
[can be imagined in North America, it will only be possible as a
combination of communism, antiracism, and climate activism]{.underline}.
I use "red, black, and green" as a heuristic for the coalition of
concerns necessary for such a party. I invoke the heuristic here to
double down against critics who prefer a thousand alternatives to the
party form. **[A thousand alternatives]{.underline}** (see Healy 2015)
[**is no alternative**. It leaves the political system we
have]{.underline}---the one [that puts all its force behind the
preservation of capitalist class interests---**intact**]{.underline}.
Some **[ideas need to be chosen, systematized into a program, and
defended]{.underline}**.

**The Alternative is to build solidarity around anti-capitalist demands

today\'s movement leaders and key organizers understand this well, and
are planning and acting accordingly. Alicia Garza, one of the founders
of Black Lives Matter, said on the eve of Trump\'s inauguration that
after five years of swelling social movements, **[whether]{.underline}**

**[force]{.underline}** that we can be, **[that will]{.underline}**
actually **[govern this country]{.underline}**. So that\'s what I\'m
focused on, and I hope that everybody else is thinking about that too.
Many people are, and as they do, we\'re seeing a rekindling of the kind
of **[utopian dreaming]{.underline}** that **[has been]{.underline}**
sorely **[missing from]{.underline}** social **[movements]{.underline}**
in recent decades. More and more frequently, immediate, pressing
demands-a \$15-an-hour living wage, an end to police killings and
deportations, a tax on carbon-are being paired with calls for a future
that is not just better than a violent, untenable present, but \...
wonderful. In the United States, **[the]{.underline}**
**[boldest]{.underline}** and most inspiring **[example of
this]{.underline}** new **[utopianism is]{.underline}** **[the Vision
for]{.underline}** **[Black Lives]{.underline}**, a sweeping policy
platform released in the summer of 2016 by the Movement for Black Lives.
Born of a coalition of over fifty Black-led organizations, the platform
states, \"We **[reject false solutions]{.underline}** **[and believe we
can achieve a complete transformation of]{.underline}** the **[current
systems]{.underline}**, **[which place profit over people]{.underline}**
and make it impossible for many of us to breathe.\" It goes on to place
police shootings and mass incarceration in the context of an economic
system that has waged war on Black and brown communities, putting them
first in line for lost jobs, hacked-back social services, and
environmental pollution. The result has been huge numbers of people
exiled from the formal economy, preyed upon by increasingly militarized
police, and warehoused in overcrowded prisons. And **[the platform
makes]{.underline}** a series of **[concrete proposals]{.underline}**,
including **[defunding prisons, removing police from schools, and
demilitarizing police]{.underline}**. It also lays out a program for
**[reparations]{.underline}** for slavery and systemic discrimination,
one that includes **[free college education and forgiveness of student
loans.]{.underline}** There is much more-nearly forty policy demands in
all, spanning changes to the tax code to **[breaking up the
banks]{.underline}**. The Atlantic magazine remarked that the platform
-which was dropped smack in the middle of the \[END PAGE 254\] US
presidential campaign- \"rivals even political-party platforms in
thoroughness.\" In the months after Trump\'s inauguration, the Movement
for Black Lives played a central role in deepening connections with
other movements, convening dozens of groups under the banner \"The
Majority.\" **[The new formation]{.underline}** **[kicked off with
a]{.underline}** thrilling month-long slate of actions between April 4
(the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King\'s assassination) and May
Day. Nationwide \"Fight Racism, Raise Pay\" **[protests linked racial
justice]{.underline}** to the fast-growing workers\' campaign for a \$15
minimum wage and the mounting attacks on immigrants. \"In the context of
Trump\'s presidency,\" the new coalition argues, \"**[it is imperative
that we put forth a true, collective vision of economic justice and
worker justice, for all people.]{.underline}**\" And in June 2017,
thousands of activists from diverse constituencies are descending on
Chicago for the second annual People\'s Summit, organized by National
Nurses United, to continue hashing out a broad-based \"People\'s
Agenda.\" Several similar state-level convergences are also under way,
in Michigan as well as North Carolina, where \"Moral Mondays\" have been
bringing movements together for several years. As one of its founders,
Reverend William Barber, has said, \"You have to build a movement, not a
moment \... I believe all these movements\--Moral Mondays, Fight for
\$15, Black Lives Matter are signs of hope that people are going to
stand up and not stand down.\" As it has in Canada, **[the climate
crisis]{.underline}** is pushing us to **[put plans for]{.underline}**
political **[transformation on a tight]{.underline}** and unyielding
**[deadline]{.underline}**. **[A powerful]{.underline}** and broad

for defeating Trumpism wherever we live go well beyond finding a
progressive savior to run for office and then offering that person our
blind support. Instead, communities and movements are uniting to lay out
the core policies that politicians who want their support must endorse.
The people\'s **[platforms are starting to lead]{.underline}**---and the

#### The entirety of weapons trade regulation perpetuates a gendered militarism that creates a structural state based violence \-\-- makes it impossible to deny the effects of how gender operates

\[Anna **Stravriankis 18**\] (Controlling weapons circulation in a
postcolonial militarised world, University of Sussex, Review of
International Studies) 5-21-2018 //pyrex ultra

So here we have an agenda for [practical action on]{.underline} the
[weapons trade]{.underline}, [challenging militarism to improve human
security]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [UN]{.underline}DP [report
identified]{.underline} the [nation-statist ideologies of
deterrence]{.underline} [and territorial security]{.underline}, [as well
as]{.underline} the [transnational practices of military assistance and
proxy wars]{.underline}, [as key causes of insecurity]{.underline}.
Simultaneously, [it reopened the]{.underline} debate about [the link
between security and development "that had been closed since the
somewhat sterile polemic around the link between disarmament and
development"]{.underline} of the 1970s and 1980s.31 [This]{.underline}
earlier, now ostensibly [outdated debate surmised that "the North (i.e.
both sides of the East-West conflict) should disarm, and devote the
resources freed up by arms reduction to development in the
South."]{.underline}32 As part of this shift in debate, [the move away
from state-centred definitions of security was accompanied by an
acknowledgment of the legitimate and crucial role of the state in
providing security -- especially as security was emphasised as a
precondition for development. So the anti-militarist call that
identified the **state** as a creator of **insecurity** So here we have
an agenda for practical action on the weapons trade, challenging
militarism to improve human security.]{.underline} So [the
anti-militarist call that identified the state as a creator of
insecurity]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} analytical and political
[move]{.underline} made [in the 1994]{.underline} [UN]{.underline}DP
[Report was to equate war with the state and move away from a concern
with territorially-based definitions of security and inter-state war,
which it equates with militarism.]{.underline} [There is a shift in
focus to the spectrum of armed violence and non-conflict violence, which
are to be remedied in the name of human security, in part through the
(re)construction of legitimate coercive apparatuses]{.underline}. [The
shift away from militarism and towards human security claims to
**acknowledge** the changing character of conflict and the role of the
state in monopolizing legitimate violence, without privileging it
unthinkingly]{.underline}. Research in this vein has flourished in the
years since the 1994 report, and brings significant advantages to bear
over traditional state-centric analyses, [such]{.underline} [as the
ability to account for the geographical diversity of rates of armed
violence within as well as between states; sustained and distinct
attention to gendered patterns of violence, including the specific
character of femicide as a distinct form of violence; and the
incorporation of questions of public health and socio-economic
inequality into discussion about weapons transfers]{.underline}.34 For
all these developments, [the human security agenda's take on war,
conflict and armed violence has not been without its critics. It has
been described as the "new orthodoxy" that is "unable to provide the
basis for a substantive change of the system of international security,"
despite finding "the old language of interstate war and conflict ...
lacking."]{.underline} 35 Similarly, [its emphasis on "progressive"
initiatives such as "eliminat\[ing\] certain types of weapons" stands
accused of failing to adequately examine "the pathologies inherent in
the structure of the international system" that generate such
challenges]{.underline}.36 [And when the "human" in human security is
naturalised as masculine, the inclusion of novel threats and new actors
leaves the parameters of security untouched, meaning that "state-based,
militarised security remains unchallenged.]{.underline}" 37 Feminist
scholars have critiqued the [gendered concepts and practices of war,
peace, militarization, peacekeeping and soldiering, going well beyond
the human security framework in the process.]{.underline}38 [Feminist
critiques that challenge the parameters of human security can usefully
be combined with postcolonial accounts of IR that emphasise the ways in
which the discipline "can both deny empire while simultaneously
normalizing an imperial perspective on the world."]{.underline}39 [Some
of the main themes of the human security agenda are illustrative of the
need for an imperial perspective in how we understand the challenges
facing weapons control. By this I mean interpreting them with the aid of
scholarship that challenges methodological nationalism and Eurocentrism
in its analysis, mobilises feminist critiques of militarism, and puts
the legacy of empire and colonialism, and the racial, gendered and
classed politics of imperial control, front and centre in its assessment
of contemporary challenges.]{.underline}40 [Deploying such resources
gives us a chance to rethink some of the key assumptions around human
security and the prospects for regulating weapons circulation. Three
core themes of the human security agenda are ripe for an **imperial
critique**. First, the claim that the character of conflict has changed,
from inter-state war towards internal conflict, has become axiomatic in
much of IR, including the human security literature]{.underline}.41 [The
greatest threats to human security are deemed to stem from internal
conflict and criminal violence, or the state itself, rather than from an
external adversary as per the traditional security agenda. As such,
"international security traditionally defined -- territorial integrity
-- does not necessarily correlate with human security."42 Second, the
changing character of conflict requires a shift in the referent object
of security, according to the human security agenda: away from the state
and inter-state war, and towards the individual and the broader range of
threats they face.]{.underline} 43 And third, [the human security agenda
nonetheless emphasises the importance of the state's monopoly on
legitimate violence and role in security provision]{.underline}.44 Yet
[the circumstances have been transformed with the end of the Cold War.
Kaldor attributes a "profound restructuring of political authority" to
the new wars, and sees human security as an opportunity for
"reconstructing political authority in the context of the processes we
call globalization."]{.underline} 45 Hence the need for security sector
reform (SSR), demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) and
other reforms of coercive practices and apparatuses. Each of these three
themes is premised on the significance of the rupture that occurred with
the end of the Cold War. But understanding the Cold War as predominantly
an East-West ideological and geopolitical confrontation marginalises
longer historical patterns of North-South power relations and conflict,
and of hot war in the South. [And the increased focus on internal
conflict, whilst fruitful in terms of changing the scale of analysis,
risks disconnecting the micro-politics of violence from broader systems
and structures of war preparation, ignoring one of the key lessons of
feminist scholarship, which is that the scales or so-called levels of
analysis are interdependent.]{.underline} As Sjoberg and Via put it,
"absolutely [distinguishing between the personal, national and
international level of war and militarism lacks conceptual and
**empirical rigor** at best": feminist attention allows us to understand
both the impact of war and militarism on people (especially, but not
only, women) as well as the gendered construction of war and
militarism.]{.underline} 46 [A]{.underline} [longer historical view that
is not hamstrung by a state-centric ontology allows us to see that arms
transfer practices have long been part of the simultaneously
transnational and asymmetrical constitution of force. Historical
scholarship on the arms trade emphasises the importance of
decolonization as the shift from empire to a system of formally
sovereign states in which North-South power asymmetries continue to
resonate.]{.underline} One of the key transformations in weapons
transfer practices that came with decolonization was a shift on the part
of the Soviet Union and China from support for national liberation
movements, to the defence of sovereignty as a means of resisting U Sled
domination, in either anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist modes. 47 The
supply of weapons and military training was a common feature of both
Soviet and US relations with the Third World: despite their differences,
North-South politico-military relations had much in common between the
two blocs. 48 [Ostensibly new or transformed challenges of the post-Cold
War era, such as Somali piracy, new wars in Africa, or insurgency and
counter-insurgency in Afghanistan, are thus better understood in
postcolonial terms, with militarised transnational continuities as well
as changes associated with the end of superpower rivalry]{.underline}.49
Mama and Okazawa-Rey emphasise [the continuities between colonial and
contemporary militarism that not only lead them to prefer the
terminology of postcolonial conflicts over that of new wars, but also
emphasise the fundamentally gendered characteristics of the physical and
structural violence at stake.]{.underline}50 And as Cooper argues, [arms
control regimes have long featured both "**proscription and
permission**" 51 operating in tandem, challenging the optimism of
accounts premised on the end of the Cold War as the changed permissive
factor that allows humanitarian concerns to be the core objective of
weapons control. This emphasis on history and power generates scepticism
about the optimism and presentism of most accounts of the emergence of
the ATT, and the linear, benevolent account of history found
therein.]{.underline}52 [A longer historical perspective allows us to
see how state security (whether national or imperial) and (what is today
called) human security have long been two sides of the same
coin.]{.underline}

**This militarism is always created from a gendered inception that
recreates itself through political discourses intensifying the violence
done**

Philosophical attention to war has typically appeared in the form of
justifications for entering into war, and over appropriate activities
within war. The spatial metaphors used to refer to war as a separate,
bounded sphere indicate assumptions that war is a realm of human
activity vastly removed from normal life, or a sort of happening that is
appropriately conceived apart from everyday events in peaceful times.
Not surprisingly, **[most discussions of the political and ethical
dimensions of war discuss war solely as an event-an occurrence, or
collection of occurrences, having clear beginnings and endings that are
typically marked by formal, institutional declarations]{.underline}**.
As happenings, wars and military activities can be seen as motivated by
identifiable, if complex, inten- tions, and directly enacted by
individual and collective decision-makers and agents of states. **[But
many of the questions about war that are of interest to
feminists-including how large-scale, state-sponsored violence affects
women and members of other oppressed groups; how military violence
shapes gen- dered, raced, and nationalistic political realities and
moral imaginations; what such violence consists of and why it persists;
how it is related to other oppressive and violent institutions and
hegemonies-cannot be adequately pursued by focusing on
events]{.underline}**. These issues are not merely a matter of good or
bad intentions and identifiable decisions. In \"Gender and \'Postmoder\'
War,\" Robin Schott introduces some of the ways in which war is
currently best seen not as an event but as a presence (Schott 1995).
Schott argues that postmodem understandings of persons, states, and
politics, as well as the high-tech nature of much **[contemporary
warfare and the preponderance of civil and nationalist wars, render an
event- based conception of war inadequate, especially insofar as gender
is taken into account.]{.underline}** In this essay, I will expand upon
her argument by showing that accounts of war that only focus on events
are impoverished in a number of ways, and therefore **[feminist
consideration of the political, ethical, and ontological dimensions of
war and the possibilities for resistance demand a much more complicated
approach]{.underline}**. I take Schott\'s characterization of war as
presence as a point of departure, though I am not committed to the idea
that the constancy of militarism, the fact of its omnipresence in human
experience, and the paucity of **[an event-based account of war are
exclusive to contemporary postmodern or postcolonial
circumstances.]{.underline}**1 **[Theory that does not investigate or
even notice the omnipresence of militarism cannot represent or address
the depth and specificity of the every- day effects of militarism on
women, on people living in occupied territories, on members of military
institutions, and on the environment.]{.underline}** These effects are
relevant to feminists in a number of ways because military practices and
institutions help construct gendered and national identity, and because
they justify the destruction of natural nonhuman entities and
communities during peacetime. **[Lack of attention to these aspects of
the business of making or preventing military violence in an extremely
technologized world results in theory that cannot accommodate the
connections among the constant pres- ence of militarism, declared wars,
and other closely related social phenomena, such as nationalistic
glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current ideological
gravitations to military solutions for social problems]{.underline}**.
Ethical approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare and
military practices are woven into the very fabric of life in
twenty-first century technological states lead to crisis-based politics
and analyses. For any feminism that aims to resist oppression and create
alternative social and political options, **[crisis-based ethics and
politics are problematic because they distract attention from the need
for sustained resistance to the enmeshed, omnipresent systems of
domination and oppression that so often function as givens in most
people\'s lives.]{.underline}** **[Neglecting the omnipresence of
militarism allows the false belief that the absence of declared armed
conflicts is peace, the polar opposite of war]{.underline}**. **[It is
particularly easy for those whose lives are shaped by the safety of
privilege, and who do not regularly encounter the realities of
militarism, to maintain this false belief]{.underline}**. **[The belief
that militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed
conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely
exercises in crisis control. Antiwar resistance is then mobilized when
the \"real\" violence finally occurs, or when the stability of privilege
is directly threatened, and at that point it is difficult not to respond
in ways that make resisters drop all other political
priorities.]{.underline}** **[Crisis-driven attention to declara- tions
of war might actually keep resisters complacent about and complicitous
in the general presence of global militarism.]{.underline}** Seeing war
as necessarily embed- ded in constant military presence draws attention
to the fact that horrific, state-sponsored violence is happening nearly
all over, all of the time, and that it is perpetrated by military
institutions and other militaristic agents of the state. **[Moving away
from crisis-driven politics and ontologies concerning war and military
violence also enables consideration of relationships among seemingly
disparate phenomena, and therefore can shape more nuanced theoretical
and practical forms of resistance.]{.underline}** For example,
investigating the ways in which war is part of a presence allows
consideration of the relationships among the events of war and the
following: how militarism is a foundational trope in the social and
political imagination; how the pervasive presence and symbolism of
soldiers/warriors/patriots shape meanings of gender; the ways in which
threats of state-sponsored violence are a sometimes invisible/sometimes
bold agent of racism, nationalism, and corporate interests; the fact
that vast numbers of communities, cities, and nations are currently in
the midst of excruciatingly violent circumstances. **[It also provides a
lens for considering the relationships among the various kinds of
violence that get labeled \"war]{.underline}**.\" Given current American
obsessions with nationalism, guns, and militias, and growing hunger for
the death penalty, prisons, and a more powerful police state, one cannot
underestimate the need for philosophical and political attention to
connec- tions among phenomena like the \"war on drugs,\" the \"war on
crime,\" and other state-funded militaristic campaigns**[. I propose
that the constancy of militarism and its effects on social reality be
reintroduced as a crucial locus of contemporary feminist
attentions]{.underline}**, **[and that feminists emphasize how wars are
eruptions and manifestations of omnipresent militarism that is a product
and tool of multiply oppressive, corporate, tech-nocratic
states.]{.underline}**2 **[Feminists should be particularly interested
in making this shift because it better allows consideration of the
effects of war and militarism on women, subjugated peoples, and
environments]{.underline}**. While giving attention to the constancy of
militarism in contemporary life we need not neglect the impor- tance of
addressing the specific qualities of direct, large-scale, declared
military conflicts. But the dramatic nature of declared, large-scale
conflicts should not obfuscate the ways in which military violence
pervades most societies in increasingly technologically sophisticated
ways and the significance of mili- tary institutions and everyday
practices in shaping reality. **[Philosophical discussions that focus
only on the ethics of declaring and fighting wars miss these
connections, and also miss the ways in which even declared military
conflicts are often experienced as omnipresent horrors]{.underline}**.
These appr unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement
in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and
militarism.

#### Masculinized Militarism underpins the viewing of gendered violence which allows us to continue structurally \-\-- this furthers violence through biopolitical control

[Feminist theory has provided critiques both of the narrow definition of
power (as domination) and the narrow view of whose power and security
matters in these accounts]{.underline}. Arguing that it is possible to
recognize through gender lenses the normative value and empirical impact
of lives on the margins of international security, much feminist work
looks for alternative ways to analyze war. This is important because, as
Fiona Robinson notes, "those who care for others, and those who are most
in need of care, are among the world's most marginalized people." [While
some characterize small powers as irrelevant because they "pose no
threat to the dominant nation's leadership in the international system,"
many feminist perspectives express concern that this view justifies
political and social **oppression for the good of peace** among great
powers. Likewise, while some would ignore the concerns of the weak
within states, because they do not make decisions or change policies
directly, many feminist scholars have seen such a move as not only
empirically problematic but also discriminatory: A concept of **national
security which gives priority to military threat** rather than to
dangers in the economic and **social sectors** of society **can be
bought only at the cost of poverty and misery** and the violation of
human rights--a cost **borne** by all poor people but **especially by
women and future generations**]{.underline}. As referenced above and
discussed in more detail in chapter 9, [wars tend to have a number of
gendered and sex-differential impacts in a number of areas, including
**direct material destruction**, the implications of **infrastructural
damage,** interactions with **patriarchal militaries**, the fallout of
**economic downturn** and the problems associated with **environmental
destruction.** These harms are often distributed disproportionately on
the basis of not only sex but also race and class to the margins of
societies, and those people's suffering is often ignored in dyadic and
state-level war theorizing.]{.underline} [Feminist theorizing, on the
other hand, often looks for what happens at the margins.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to reject the aff in favor of adopting a feminist pedagogy---we must embrace discomfort in order to critique the educational spaces we engage. Feminist pedagogy is key to thinking critically about the traditional canon of patriarchal Militarism.

Professor of Education Kathleen Weiler states: "I would like to suggest
that [feminist pedagogy, like feminism itself, is ultimately a political
project]{.underline}" (67). Most feminist professors writing about
feminist pedagogy have a similar appreciation for the intrinsically
political nature of feminist pedagogy. Weiler describes the role
feminist pedagogy plays in the field of education: [In terms of
education, feminists have been influential in challenging the structure
of the traditional canon and in suggesting alternative classroom
practices; both of these interventions have been included in the broad
term feminist pedagogy]{.underline}. . . . What distinguishes feminist
pedagogy from these other approaches, of course, is [its analysis of
patriarchy and attempts to develop an education appropriate for women.
(]{.underline}68) As this description shows, [feminist pedagogy is not
only teaching about feminism; it simultaneously mandates a feminist
critique of the educational process, as well as implementation of
anti-hierarchal techniques]{.underline} in the classroom. [This practice
helps to reeducate students holistically, enabling them to become
empowered, active learners and assisting them with using their
educational experience as a means of social justice. This
empowerment]{.underline} however, [must overcome a "hidden
curriculum"]{.underline} lurking within the university system (Boyer and
Larson, 168-169). According to psychologists Boyer and Larson, this
"hidden curriculum" is [composed of rules for advancement and success,
messages regarding who belongs]{.underline} in the university and who is
outside it [and, "institutionalized monocultural androcentrism" which
demands cultural transformation of anyone from "outside"]{.underline}
the university---[all forcing minorities (including women) to abandon
their cultural uniqueness in exchange for academic success]{.underline}
(168-169). In order to overcome these problems, [feminist pedagogy
strives to create a space and a method for its students to unlearn these
rules and arm themselves with theory that supports their
self-rediscovery]{.underline}, so that they can better cope in more
traditional university courses. Professor of English Magda Gere Lewis
explains: [Women often come away from the experience of the feminist
classroom not only with new understandings both of history and of
possible futures]{.underline}---the wish for a feminist utopia embedded
in practice rather than the death wish for a perfect world---[but, as
well, prepared to articulate practical strategies for critique which
challenge the androcentric biases of their other courses]{.underline}.
This does not always gain them favor. Their experiences reflect how
difficult this is to do in the face of resistance and the determined
power of the status quo to hold firm its privilege to articulate our
collective meaning. (67) According to professor of women's studies Jean
Fox O'Barr, preparation for a lifestyle of resistance to the mainstream
is needed by women's studies graduate students, in particular, given
that their academic department is not only their "social" but their
"professional" world as well (117). Women's studies graduate students
often choose to merge their extracurricular social justice work with
their professional work, making their professions a site of cultural
resistance. As a result, this double identification with their
department ensures that women's studies graduate students "experience
the issue of isolation more intensely" (O'Barr, 117). For many, the
women's studies method is something to be feared: 38 Graduate students
often find explorations into the history of feminist scholarship both
critical and frightening. They know that without this material they
cannot get the full benefit of their disciplinary journeys. Yet [gaining
a feminist perspective makes them angry, frustrated, and sometimes
discouraged with how much remains to be done]{.underline}. . . .
Graduate students face another reality: that learning this new material
[requires them to unlearn]{.underline} some of their collegiate
knowledge they have mastered and to which they cling when so many
previous foundations are being shaken. (O'Barr, 117-118) Conversely, [if
students are willing to enter into an uncomfortable critique, unlearn
cherished knowledge and be filled with anger and frustration, the
payoffs can be as intense as the difficult process of feminist
exploration.]{.underline} In Teaching to Transgress The feminist
classroom was the one space where students could rgayaise critical
questions about the pedagogical process. These critiques were not always
encouraged or well received, but they were allowed. [That small
acceptance of critical interrogation was a crucial challenge inviting us
as students to think seriously about pedagogy in relation to the
practice of freedom]{.underline}. (6) , English and women's studies
professor bell hooks describes this transformation: For bell hooks,
[being free begins with learning how to think critically]{.underline}:
"In our society, which is so fundamentally anti-intellectual, critical
thinking is not encouraged. . . . Conditions of radical openness exist
in any learning situation where students and teachers celebrate their
abilities to think critically, to engage in pedagogical praxis"
(Teaching to Transgress, 202). Many feminist scholars insist that
[teaching students to think critically must serve as the foundation to
feminist pedagogy]{.underline}. Professors of English Amy Spanger
Gerald, Kathleen McEvoy and Pamela Whitfield write: "[Critical thinking,
as manifested in the ability to resist accepted truths about literature,
traditional modes of writing, and stereotypical ideas about speaking, is
a feminist approach because it fights limiting and inherently
patriarchal educational practices]{.underline}" (48). Feminist teachers
want students to [learn how to be comfortable being
uncomfortable]{.underline} and want to provide them with experience and
skills (partially through the use of alternative classroom techniques)
to deal with this lifestyle of constant confrontation.

### Militarism \-\-- Short

#### Arms Control Regulation is always done through a humanitarian context that coopts the actual regulation of those weaponry and transforms it from a removing human suffering to an intensification of colonialist powers of liberal democracy and neoliberalism

\[Anna **Stravriankis 18**\] (Controlling weapons circulation in a
postcolonial militarised world, University of Sussex, Review of
International Studies) 5-21-2018 //pyrex ultra

[The ATT is in many ways the **epitome** of post-Cold War humanitarian
**arms control** and the broader human security agenda]{.underline}.
[The purpose of reducing human suffering, the inclusion of IHL and human
rights in the operative provisions of the treaty and of SALW in the
scope of weapons to be regulated, as well as the landmark inclusion of
genderbased violence (GBV) as an issue States Parties must take account
of when approving weapons exports, all point to the ways in which human
security and humanitarian arms control attempt to protect individuals in
war and in situations of armed violence. Key features of the negotiating
process -- the role of small and middle powers, and civil society; and
the challenges posed to the sclerotic UN negotiating machinery --
resonate with the global governance elements of previous human
security-related weapons campaigns against landmines, cluster munitions
and SALW]{.underline}.6 Indeed, Erickson describes [the process as a
"marriage between traditional security and human security begun by the
landmine campaign."]{.underline} Activists and scholars have attempted
to [elevate human rights and humanitarian concerns for the broad swathe
of the world's population above the political economy and security
interests of states and arms-producing companies. Weapons-specific
initiatives]{.underline} such as the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and 2008
Convention on Cluster Munitions [had shown the impact that a
humanitarian framing can have in relation to particular
**technologies**]{.underline}. [The negotiation]{.underline} of the 2001
Programme of Action [to Prevent]{.underline}, Combat [and
Eradicate]{.underline} the Illicit [Trade in]{.underline}
[S]{.underline}mall [A]{.underline}rms and [L]{.underline}ight
[W]{.underline}eapons in All Its Aspects [showed the challenge of
applying human security principles to weapons with legitimate military
and security uses -- a challenge that was to resurface during the
ATT]{.underline} negotiations. [Regulating the conventional arms trade
as a whole cannot take a purely disarmament or humanitarian frame, given
its deeply entrenched legitimacy. This makes the ATT a human security
initiative rather than a primarily humanitarian arms control or
disarmament one]{.underline} 8 -- [whilst it has the reduction of human
suffering as a named purpose, this sits alongside "international and
regional peace, security and stability" in Article 1 of the
text]{.underline}. As Martin and Owen put it, "[The idea of arms control
is appealing to proponents of human security because it sets out to
control tools of violence, as well as seeking to curb the dominance of
the state in determining the forms of insecurity to which policy
solutions must be found]{.underline}."9 Jody Williams, founding
coordinator of the ICBL, calls on governments and civil society to work
together, including on initiatives like the ATT, "to advance human
security as a viable alternative to militarism and violence and war."10
Sympathetic criticism of the ATT has been aired from within the academic
and scholar-practitioner community. Bolton and James argue that [the
treaty represents a "melding" of a "'maximalist' human security--civil
society approach with concerns of developing countries and the
'minimalist' strategic and commercial interests of the major arms
exporters]{.underline}."11 Chinkin and Kaldor argue that ["the
humanitarian achievements" of post-Cold War weapons control "need to be
complemented by disarmament." That is, as well as "bringing states'
human rights obligations into the heart of weapons control," human
security requires "the reduction of existing weapon stocks and
prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of further
weapons."]{.underline}12 Such a call echoes the demand of the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), one of the civil
society organisations active on the ATT, for disarmament as a
long-standing, yet marginalised feminist concern. Others have been less
sympathetically critical. For Cooper, [initiatives like the ATT "do not
represent a novel post-Cold War development that symbolizes progress on
an emancipatory human security agenda."]{.underline}14 [Post-Cold War
arms trade regulation has been based on a "discourse around
humanitarianism, human security and weapons precision" that has served
to **legitimize high-tech military technologies.**]{.underline} 15
Cooper and others emphasise [the deep historical roots of the way
humanitarian impulses intersect with economic and security ones,
including in late nineteenth century efforts to regulate the supply and
circulation of weapons in the imperial peripheries that are remarkably
resonant with contemporary efforts]{.underline}. 16 Historically minded
scholars remind us that [surplus and obsolete weapons have long
circulated in the peripheries of empire, and new weapons tested there;
and political authorities were licensing weapons exports as early as the
16th century]{.underline} -- in part to avoid blowback.17 [**Arms**
trade **regulation**]{.underline}, then, [has a "historically
contingent" character, marked by the ongoing importance of "**power**,
interest, **economy, security**."]{.underline}18 [Militarism emerges as
a core concern]{.underline} out of such critiques [and]{.underline}
provides [the jumping off point]{.underline} for this analysis. In
particular, there are long traditions of historical sociological and
feminist scholarship on militarism, 19 defined here [as]{.underline}
"[the social and international relations of the preparation for, and
conduct of, organized political violence]{.underline}." 20 [In relation
to arms control]{.underline}, I have argued elsewhere that [the ATT has
been mobilised by liberal democratic states primarily to legitimise
their arms transfer practices.]{.underline} 21 [And]{.underline} Cooper
concludes that "[campaigners]{.underline} need to [return to a strategic
contestation of global militarism rather than searching for tactical
campaign victories dependent on accommodation with the language and
economic and security paradigms of contemporary military
humanism]{.underline}."22 [This is]{.underline} part of [a political
economy]{.underline} critique [of the way]{.underline} "[the regulation
of pariah weapons might alternatively be described as 'arms control from
below within the logic of militarism from above']{.underline},"23 [in
line with]{.underline} a wider critique of [human security
as]{.underline} having been "[institutionalised and co-opted to work in
the interests of global **capitalism**, **militarism** and **neoliberal
governance**]{.underline}." 24 Cooper and Mutimer, surveying [the
history of and prospects for controlling the means of
violence]{.underline}, argue that "[the longer term, indirect effect
should be to reduce militarism and promote cultures of peace" or "at the
very least, avoid further embedding cultures of
militarism]{.underline}."25 How, then, should we think about the impact
of the human security agenda on militarism, and vice versa; and what are
the ramifications for weapons control?

#### Militarism results in permanent endless war, structural violence, and ecological catastrophe that will result in inevitable extinction 

\[Henry **Giroux 14**\] (Killing Machines and the Madness of Militarism:
From Gaza to Afghanistan.\" Truthout. N.p) 07-24-2014//pyrex ultra

[Militarism is like a lethal virus that takes as its first victim both
historical memory and any sense of moral and social
responsibility]{.underline}. In the United States and Israel, at the
present moment, it is no longer one strain of ideology that permeates
these societies[; it is a general condition that gives meaning to almost
all aspects of life. Incapable of thinking beyond military solutions to
social problems, militarism absolves individuals and
governments]{.underline}, if not the general public[, of the horror
produced by the weapons it builds]{.underline}; moreover, just as it
erases the memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it suggests that the
hundreds of children killed in Gaza is a military necessity. The
apostles of militarism offer jobs to the public that engage in the
production of organized violence; they preach war as a cleansing
solution, while they sanitize language of any meaning, erasing the
suffering, misery, and horror inflicted by their drone missiles, jets,
Apache helicopters, and bombs. All that has to be invoked are the words
\"collateral damage\" or \"military necessity\" and the death-laden
actions produced by the new militarists disappear into the dark
vocabulary of authoritarian doublespeak. [War is no longer a source of
alarm, but pride, and it has become an organizing principle of many
societies.]{.underline} Informed by a kind of primitive tribalism,
**[militarism enshrines a deadly type of masculinity that mythologizes
violence and mimics the very terrorism it claims to be fighting.
Militarism and war have not only changed the nature of the political
order but the nature and character of American life.]{.underline}** When
children are killed by Israeli missiles while playing on a beach in
Gaza, the horror and sheer brutality of the murderous act is wiped away
by the crude argument that such needless slaughter is a military
necessity. There is no defense for killing children, regardless of
whether it is done by the Israeli state, the United States, Hamas, or
anyone else. We live in a time in which [political illiteracy and moral
tranquilization work in tandem to produce the authoritarian subject,
willing to participate in their own oppression and the oppression of
others]{.underline}. Thus, the silence over filling our prisons with
poor people of color, treating desperate immigrant children as if they
were vermin, and allowing elected officials to replace reason with forms
of militant religious fundamentalism. What kind of moral arrangements
does a society give up when there is no outrage over the fact that the
United States supplies billions of dollars in armaments to other states
and thus is complicit in the killing of young children and others
through acts of state terrorism? **[The militarists come from various
political parties and are hooked into a market-driven logic that
disdains thinking about social costs or the despair they create. They
are unadulterated agents of cruelty and their power serves a corrupt
form of casino capitalism that breathes and breeds the ideology and
policies of the military-industrial-surveillance complex.]{.underline}**
In the United States, [trillions are spent on wars that were based on
and initiated with lies.]{.underline} At the same time, [social services
are cut, schools abandoned, infrastructures ignored so that the military
can build F-35 jets at the cost of \$200 million apiece - pieces of junk
plagued by mechanical failures and a sober witness to the United
States\' unwillingness to use the money of war and violence to build a
decent, democratic society in which vulnerability and care become the
watchwords rather than violence and war. The morally reprehensible
killing of children in Afghanistan, Gaza and Iraq is part of a larger
problem, one that haunts the late modern period, which is the rise of
neoliberal totalitarianism by which I mean an economic and cultural
system that is sutured in its allegiance to money, profit, power,
inequality, greed, militarism, the punishing state and self-interests.
The new global capital societies such as the United States have replaced
the social contract with a defense contract.]{.underline} [Zombie
politics now rules as the living dead function as parasites on their
respective societies, engulfing them with the fog of war, corruption and
death.]{.underline} How else would one explain bringing Dick Cheney,
John Bolton and Bill Kristol back to life on the mainstream airwaves?
Like George Romero\'s zombies, Cheney and his ilk proliferate like a
lethal virus out of control. But pointing to the new forms of zombie
politics awash in the U.S. and other countries is not enough. The
question that must be raised is what is it in the United States that
produces an inattentiveness to moral outrage, dissent, and mass
mobilizations? [The failure of conscience and the willingness to stand
up against the new authoritarians]{.underline} whether in Israel,
England, France, Greece, or the United States promotes a flirtation with
modes of [irrationality that lie at the heart of the triumph of everyday
aggression over the slightest semblance of justice.]{.underline} Under
such circumstances, [war and the over identification with militarism
produces a new kind of national psychosis and collective
pathology.]{.underline} We live in the age of killing machines, parading
under the poison of exceptionalism and empire. We are in the midst of
something different in the current historical moment. Democracy is
losing its appeal, fascists are gaining in popularity around the globe,
and millions of men, women and children are now considered excess,
disposable, because they are dehumanized, considered other, or fall
outside of the blessings of a rabid consumerist society. [The new breed
of politicians]{.underline} unleashed by the Reagan revolution [disdain
the government, except when it benefits the rich and celebrates
individual solutions to larger public issues, rendering individuals
vulnerable, powerless, anxious and disillusioned.]{.underline}
[Technology]{.underline} [rather than ethics and compassion now provide
the answers to society\'s problem.]{.underline} Data has replaced words,
ethics and the hard work, as Marx once observed, of teaching everyone to
be able to engage in a \"ruthless criticism of everything.\" The current
crisis surrounding Gaza, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the looting of the
public treasury by the rich and financial elite speak to a crisis of
individual, social and historical agency. [Democratic governance is no
longer part of the vocabulary of the militarists]{.underline} because
the latter would suggest an understanding of the morally rightful use of
power, rule, representation, justice and equality. [The death dealing
zones of ethical tranquillization called Silicon Valley now provide the
new model of the consumer-tech obsessed citizen]{.underline} - a largely
illiterate, privatized, overly specialized, asocial being so
depoliticized that it becomes difficult for them to even talk on the
phone with another person, never mind have actual, corporeal, thinking
relationships with others. It also models a society that has no memory,
ethics, sense of justice or the future[. Militarism is a new form of
illiteracy and psychosis,]{.underline} symptomatic of the failure of
civic courage because it demands obedience and punishes people who are
critical, capable of questioning authority, and are willing to address
important social issues. Edward Snowden and other courageous
whistleblowers are considered traitors because they [revealed the
massive violation of civil liberties by the government and the existence
of **an authoritarian surveillance society in which the state and
corporations fuse in their attempts to squelch dissent and
freedom**]{.underline}. Bill Gates is considered a hero, though he may
be the most powerful force in the United States destroying public
education and a grotesque symbol of massive inequality. Illiterate
militarists such as Senators John McCain, Lindsay Graham and most of the
Republican Party are given endless airtime even though their discourse
is immersed in the blight of militarism, war and state violence.
President Obama is defended by liberals in spite of his shredding of
civil liberties and his unparalleled and unconscionable support of the
financial crooks and policies that caused the great recession in 2007.
What [Obama has made clear is that liberalism is now the new
conservatism and that the two party system is completely in the hands of
the rich, corporations, and financial services**. The reach of violence
and death is everywhere permeating the culture like an endless sandstorm
that destroys everything it touches.**]{.underline} Major articles and
even a movie appear in the militarized state praising Ivy League
schools, though they produce the criminogenic environments that gave us
the intellectual killers that produced the slaughter in Vietnam, Iraq,
and the endless forms of foreign and domestic terrorism that now reside
in many of the advanced societies of the world. [**Some would say we
live in troubled times and, that is only partly true, because the times
in which we live are more than troubled; they are close to coming to an
end as the logic of the bomb expresses itself in the blowing up and
ecological destruction of the planet**. Everything we have learned from
the dominant ideologies, vocabularies, values and social relations must
be re-examined, discarded when necessary, and in its place we need a new
political language, a new understanding of governance locally and
globally.]{.underline} We need to resurrect a radical notion of what we
all have in common, the common good and public values, and think hard
about what work has to be done not just to survive, but to thrive in a
democratically inspired world. Time has overcome us, outpaced our
capacities to slow down and think critically and act courageously. This
does not suggest we need to change the world, a cliché used by Gates and
other Silicon Valley, Wall-Street agents of conformity. [What it does
suggests is]{.underline} [a notion of social, economic and political
change inspired by a vision of a democracy to come, a society in which
it is reprehensible to even consider using torture, killing children as
a military necessity, and destroying social benefits to increase the
wealth of corporations, hedge fund managers and bankers who are soulless
and a powerful threat to democracy and the planet.]{.underline} It is
time to identify the people, institutions, social relations, values and
power relations that constitute the new authoritarianism and to hold
them accountable. It is also time to remember the suffering caused by
militarists in the past, and it is time to remember the struggles waged
by working people, women, young people and others who dared to believe
that another kind of vision, another kind of future, is possible. **[We
don\'t have much time left. Resistance is no longer a luxury; it is a
necessity.]{.underline}**

precisely the kind of **[violence]{.underline}** that their theory is
con- cerned with. As intellectually impressive as analytical just war
accounts are, they do not convey any critical sense of Western moralism.
**[It is as though just war theory were written for a different world

justice]{.underline}** to individual persons,59 **[it is nonchalant
about suffering of unimaginable proportions and it suffocates a nuanced
moral world in a rigid binary structure designed to deliver unambiguous,
action-guiding recommendations.]{.underline}** According to the tragic
conception defended here, justified warfare constitutes a moral evil,
not just a physical one -- whatever Coates' aforementioned distinction
is supposed to amount to. **[If we do not recognise the moral evil of
justified warfare, we run the risk of speaking the following kind of
language when talking to a tortured mother, who has witnessed her child
being bombed]{.underline}** into pieces, justifiably let us assume,
**[in the course of a 'just war': See, we did not bomb your toddler into
pieces intentionally. You should also consider that our war was
justified and that]{.underline}**, in performing this particular act of
war, **[we pursued a valid moral goal]{.underline}** of destroying the
enemy's ammunition factory. And be aware that killing your toddler was
not instrumental to that pursuit. **[As you can see, there was nothing
wrong with what we did.]{.underline}** (OR: As you can see, we only
infringed the right of your non-liable child not to be targeted, but we
did not violate it.) Needless to say, we regret your loss. **[This would
be a deeply pathological thing to say, but it is precisely
what]{.underline}** at least **[some contemporary]{.underline}** just
war **[theorists]{.underline}** would **[seem to advise. The
monstrosity]{.underline}** of some accounts of contemporary just war
theory **[seems to derive from]{.underline}** a combination of
**[the]{.underline}** degree of **[certainty with which moral judgments
are offered and the ability to regard the moral case as closed once the
judgments have been made. One implication of my argument for just
theorists is clear enough: they should critically reflect]{.underline}**
**[on the]{.underline}** one-dimensionality of **[their]{.underline}**
dominant **[agenda of making binary moral judgments about
war.]{.underline}** **[If they did, they would become more sympathetic
to the pacifist argument, not to the conclusion drawn by pacifists who
are also caught in a binary mode of thinking (i.e. never wage war,
regardless of the circumstances!) but to the timeless wisdom that forms
the essence of the pacifist argument. It is wrong to knowingly
kill]{.underline}** and maim **[people]{.underline}**, and it does not
matter, at least not as much as the adherents of double effect claim,
whether the killing is done intentionally or 'merely' with foresight.
The difference would be psychological, too. **[Moral philosophers of war
would no longer be forced to concede this moral truth; rather, they
would be free to embrace it. There is no reason for them to disrespect
the essence of pacifism.]{.underline}** The just war theorist Larry May
implicitly offers precisely such a tragic vision in his sympathetic
discussion of 'Grotius and Contingent Pacifism'. According to May, 'war
can sometimes be justified on the same grounds on which certain forms of
pacifism are themselves grounded'.60 If this is correct, **[just war
theorists have good reason to stop calling themselves by their name.
They would no longer be just war theorists, but unjust war theorists,
confronting politicians with a jus contra bellum, rather than offering
them a jus ad bellum. Beyond]{.underline}** being **[that, they would be
much 'humbler in \[their\] approach to considering the justness of
war']{.underline}** (or, rather, the justifiability), **[acknowledging
that:]{.underline}** **[notions of legitimate violence which appear
so]{.underline}** vivid and **[complete to the thinking individual are
only moments and snapshots of a wider history concerning the different
ways in which humans have ordered their]{.underline}** arguments and
**[practices of legitimate violence. Humility in this context does not
mean weakness. It involves a concern with the implicit danger of
adopting an arrogant approach to the problem of war.]{.underline}**61
**[Binary thinking in just war theory is indeed arrogant, as is the
failure to acknowledge the]{.underline}** legitimacy of -- and **[need
for]{.underline}** -- **[ambiguity]{.underline}**, agony **[and doubt
in]{.underline}** moral **[thinking about war.]{.underline}** Humble
philosophers of war, on the contrary, would acknowledge that any talk of
justice is highly misleading in the context of war.62 It does not
suffice here, in my view, to point out that 'we' have always understood
what 'they' meant (assuming they meant what we think they meant).
Fiction aside, **[there is no such thing as a just war.]{.underline}**
There is also no such thing as a morally justified war that comes
without ambiguity and moral remainders. **[Any language of justified
warfare must therefore be]{.underline}** carefully drafted and
**[constantly questioned. It should demonstrate an]{.underline}**
inherent, **[acute awareness of the fragility of moral thinking about
war, rather than an eagerness to construct unbreakable chains of
reasoning.]{.underline}** **[Being uncertain about]{.underline}**, and
agonised by, **[the justifiability of waging war does not put a moral
philosopher to shame. The uncertainty is not only moral, it is also
epistemic. Contemporary just war theorists proceed as if certainty were
the rule]{.underline}**, and uncertainty the exception. **[The world to
which just war theory applies is one of radical and unavoidable
uncertainty]{.underline}** though, **[where politicians]{.underline}**,
voters **[and combatants do not always know who their enemies are;
whether or not they really exist (and if so, why they exist and how they
have come into existence); what weapons the enemies have (if
any);]{.underline}** whether or not, when, and how they are willing to
employ them; **[why exactly the enemies are fought and what the
consequences of fighting or not fighting them will be. Philosophers of
war should]{.underline}** also **[become more sensitive to the problem
of political moralism. The just war language is
dangerous]{.underline}**, particularly when spoken by eager, self-
righteous, over-confident moralists trying to make a case. **[It would
be a pity if philosophers of war, despite having the]{.underline}**
smartest of brains and the **[best of intentions, effectively ended up
delivering rhetorical ammunition to political moralists. To avoid being
inadvertently complicit]{.underline}** in that sense, **[they could
give]{.underline}** public lectures on the dangers of political
moralism, that is, on thinking about war in terms of black and white,
good and evil and them and us. They could warn us against Euro-centrism,
missionary zeal and the emperors' moralistic clothes. They could also
**[investigate the historical genesis and structural conditionality
of]{.underline}** large-scale **[aggressive behaviour in the global
arena]{.underline}**, deconstruct- ing how warriors who claim to be
justified are potentially tied into histories and structures, asking
them: Who are you to make that claim? A philosopher determined **[to go
beyond the narrow discursive parameters provided by the
contemporary]{.underline}** just war **[paradigm would surely embrace
some]{.underline}**thing like Marcus' 'second-order **[regulative
principle', which could indeed lead to '"better"
policy'.]{.underline}**63 If justified wars are unjust and if it is true
that not all tragedies of war are authentic, then political agents ought
to prevent such tragedies from occurring. **[This demanding
principle]{.underline}**, however, **[may require a more fundamental
reflection on how we 'conduct our lives and arrange our
institutions']{.underline}** (Marcus) **[in this world. It is not enough
to adopt a 'wait and see' policy, simply waiting for potential
aggressions to occur and making sure that we do not go to war unless
doing so is a 'last resort'. Large-scale violence between human beings

failure]{.underline}** of those who are potentially aggressing, **[and
if]{.underline}** it turns out that some of **[these causes can be

security as a viable alternative to militarism and violence and war."10
Sympathetic criticism of the ATT has been aired from within the academic
and scholar-practitioner community. Bolton and James argue that [the
treaty represents a "melding" of a "'maximalist' human security--civil
society approach with concerns of developing countries and the
'minimalist' strategic and commercial interests of the major arms
exporters]{.underline}."11 Chinkin and Kaldor argue that ["the
humanitarian achievements" of post-Cold War weapons control "need to be
complemented by disarmament." That is, as well as "bringing states'
human rights obligations into the heart of weapons control," human
security requires "the reduction of existing weapon stocks and
prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of further
weapons."]{.underline}12 Such a call echoes the demand of the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), one of the civil
society organisations active on the ATT, for disarmament as a
long-standing, yet marginalised feminist concern. Others have been less
sympathetically critical. For Cooper, [initiatives like the ATT "do not
represent a novel post-Cold War development that symbolizes progress on
an emancipatory human security agenda."]{.underline}14 [Post-Cold War
arms trade regulation has been based on a "discourse around
humanitarianism, human security and weapons precision" that has served
to **legitimize high-tech military technologies.**]{.underline} 15
Cooper and others emphasise [the deep historical roots of the way
humanitarian impulses intersect with economic and security ones,
including in late nineteenth century efforts to regulate the supply and
circulation of weapons in the imperial peripheries that are remarkably
resonant with contemporary efforts]{.underline}. 16 Historically minded
scholars remind us that [surplus and obsolete weapons have long
circulated in the peripheries of empire, and new weapons tested there;
and political authorities were licensing weapons exports as early as the
16th century]{.underline} -- in part to avoid blowback.17 [**Arms**
trade **regulation**]{.underline}, then, [has a "historically
contingent" character, marked by the ongoing importance of "**power**,
interest, **economy, security**."]{.underline}18 [Militarism emerges as
a core concern]{.underline} out of such critiques [and]{.underline}
provides [the jumping off point]{.underline} for this analysis. In
particular, there are long traditions of historical sociological and
feminist scholarship on militarism, 19 defined here [as]{.underline}
"[the social and international relations of the preparation for, and
conduct of, organized political violence]{.underline}." 20 [In relation
to arms control]{.underline}, I have argued elsewhere that [the ATT has
been mobilised by liberal democratic states primarily to legitimise
their arms transfer practices.]{.underline} 21 [And]{.underline} Cooper
concludes that "[campaigners]{.underline} need to [return to a strategic
contestation of global militarism rather than searching for tactical
campaign victories dependent on accommodation with the language and
economic and security paradigms of contemporary military
humanism]{.underline}."22 [This is]{.underline} part of [a political
economy]{.underline} critique [of the way]{.underline} "[the regulation
of pariah weapons might alternatively be described as 'arms control from
below within the logic of militarism from above']{.underline},"23 [in
line with]{.underline} a wider critique of [human security
as]{.underline} having been "[institutionalised and co-opted to work in
the interests of global **capitalism**, **militarism** and **neoliberal
governance**]{.underline}." 24 Cooper and Mutimer, surveying [the
history of and prospects for controlling the means of
violence]{.underline}, argue that "[the longer term, indirect effect
should be to reduce militarism and promote cultures of peace" or "at the
very least, avoid further embedding cultures of
militarism]{.underline}."25 How, then, should we think about the impact
of the human security agenda on militarism, and vice versa; and what are
the ramifications for weapons control?

March 11 marks the third anniversary of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake
that shook northeastern Japan in 2011, triggering a tsunami in a dual
disaster that killed more than 16,000 people. The earthquake and tsunami
caused the worst nuclear disaster in history with three meltdowns at the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Three years after the
catastrophe, 136,000 people from Fukushima prefecture are still
displaced, and numerous disaster-related deaths have resulted from
stress-related illnesses and suicide. Because of the nuclear meltdown,
highly radioactive material continues to leak into the ocean, presenting
numerous technical challenges with no solution yet in sight. This
environmental contamination, which has impacted residents, workers, and
military personnel responders, will have a global effect. Lessons
learned from Chernobyl suggest that all this is only the tip of the
iceberg. "The Great East Japan Earthquake" is just one of several
massive disasters in the Asia-Pacific this past decade. The 2004 Indian
Ocean Tsunami took the lives of 230,000 people in 14 countries. Most
recently, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) ripped through Samar and Leyte in the
Philippines, causing 6,000 deaths last November. The Philippines has
witnessed several other devastating typhoons, including Ketsana (Ondoy)
in 2009 and Bopha (Pablo) in 2012. A rising pattern of intense storms
and disasters in the Asia-Pacific region has led to the death and
displacement of thousands of people and the destruction of essential
urban and rural infrastructure such as roads, bridges, schools, health
centers, and workplaces. [Paralleling these disasters has been the
disaster response of the U.S. military. According to this "disaster
militarism"---which is a pattern of rhetoric, beliefs, and
practices---the military should be the primary responder to large-scale
disasters. Disaster militarism is not only reflected in the deployment
of troops but also in media discourse that naturalizes and calls for
military action in times of environmental catastrophes.]{.underline}
Justifying U.S. Military Presence [Military Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Relief (HADR) operations, such as Operation Damayan in the
Philippines in 2013 and Operation Tomodachi (Friend) in Japan in 2011,
have showcased the U.S. military's "helpfulness," legitimized its
presence, and softened its image. Charles-Antoine Hofmann and Laura
Hudson, researching this topic for the British Red Cross, note several
factors driving the growing military interest in responding to
disasters. Assisting relief efforts, they observed, can improve the
military's image and provide training opportunities. It is also a way
for the military to diversify its role when armed forces face budget
cuts. Disaster relief has also become part of the justification for
increased U.S. troop deployments in the Asia-Pacific region---even as
the new military basing component of the "Pacific Pivot" has met with
strong opposition in Okinawa, Japan and Jeju, South Korea. This massive
permanent presence in the Asia-Pacific region has enabled the U.S.
military to be the "first and fastest" to respond to sudden calamity.
The Pacific Command boasts 330,000 personnel (one-fifth of all U.S.
forces), 180 ships, and 2,000 aircraft in an area that spans half the
earth's surface and is home to half the earth's population. Disaster
relief is not the military's primary mission, role, or area of
expertise. Nevertheless, disaster response missions facilitate military
expansion and dominance. Yoshiyuki Uehara, the vice-governor of Okinawa
at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, has opposed the plan to
construct a new offshore U.S. Marine base on the island. "I hope we stop
glorifying Operation Tomodachi," he warned. "Our gratitude \[for U.S.
military assistance after the earthquake and tsunami\] and U.S. military
base problems are separate issues." The core of Operation Tomodachi was
Joint Task Force 519 from the United States Pacific Command. Arguably,
the response to disaster was a perfect opportunity for the United States
to demonstrate to China that an immediate U.S.-Japan joint military
operation was possible.]{.underline} The United States spent \$80
million for this operation. Less than three weeks after the Fukushima
disaster, Japan promised to increase its Host Nation Support from three
to five years and to pay 188 million yen annually for U.S. military
facilities in the country. The U.S. government used the rhetoric of
disaster militarism to justify Japan's dependence on U.S. military
forces and the high concentration of U.S. bases in tiny Okinawa. The
Okinawa Times argued that this was a clear "political exploitation of
the earthquake disaster." [This was not the first time that disaster
relief was used to further larger geopolitical and military goals. The
rapid mobilization of assistance using military capabilities from the
United States, Japan, India, and Australia in the wake of the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami "set the ball rolling for a four-way security
dialogue a few years later," former Australian diplomat Rory Metcalf has
argued. Just weeks after Typhoon Haiyan, meanwhile, the Philippine and
U.S. governments were touting relief efforts as justification for the
need for a new long-term agreement for greater bilateral military
cooperation and an increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines
(the Philippine constitution currently bans permanent troops and bases).
Washington has used disaster militarism as additional leverage to
pressure the Philippine government to accept a mutual defense agreement.
The race to provide relief for political leverage is not limited to the
United States. China offered its 14,000-ton floating military hospital,
the Peace Ark, for Haiyan relief efforts---its first humanitarian
response operation. Japan also sent military forces to the Philippines
for relief work, in cooperation with the U.S. military, a political
effort by the current Japanese government to secure a greater military
role overseas.]{.underline} The Contradictions of Disaster Militarism
[The conflation of military power and disaster relief is highly
problematic. It is not cost-effective, efficient, or transparent.
Military operations exhaust limited budgets for humanitarian assistance,
rehabilitation, and reconstruction activities. Confusion about the
military's role as soldiers or relief providers can lead to suspicion
and fear, and some people may not access relief as a result. According
to the Department of Defense, the Pacific Command offers not only aid to
countries in the region dealing with disasters, but also "forms of
advice and assistance, training, satellite imagery or intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance support." More troops on the ground
offer greater opportunities for the gathering of intelligence.
Revelations that a CIA-funded fake vaccination program in Pakistan was
used to find and kill Osama bin Laden provide another example of
co-mingling humanitarian relief and military operations, rightly
contributing to civilian confusion, public distrust, and questions of
transparency and accountability. Disaster militarism does not address
the underlying causes for the increasing number of intense storms and
natural disasters. Nor can disaster militarism be separated from the
U.S. military's record as a the "worst polluter on the planet" for its
"uninhibited use of fossil fuels, massive creation of greenhouse gases,
and extensive release of radioactive and chemical contaminants into the
air, water, and soil," as a recent Project Censored story detailed. In
times of disaster, the U.S. military positions itself as a "savior" and
attempts to obscure its role as a major contributor to the rise of
climate disasters. There is certainly an urgent need for disaster
preparedness, with trained emergency personnel in local communities as
well as international teams. The first responders in disasters are
families, neighbors, community groups, professional organizations,
churches, international humanitarian organizations, and governments.
Resources should go to these local institutions to strengthen their
capacity to respond to disasters and continue the work when emergency
teams have all gone home. Padayon sa Pag-laum (Hope After Haiyan or
WEDPRO) and other local Philippine organizations focus their relief
efforts on the needs of the most vulnerable sectors of society,
especially women and children. Their longer-term goal is to co-create
solutions for a more resilient, more sustainable, and more inclusive
future for the communities affected by the typhoon. Nor should we wait
for climate disasters to hit before we respond. Long-term and sustained
resources should be made available ahead of time, especially to
countries like the Philippines that experience typhoons on a regular
basis. This would make for greater local independence in allocating
relief resources. It would also lessen dependency on military
operations. World military expenditure totaled a massive \$1.75 trillion
in 2012, with the United States and its allies responsible for the vast
majority. These expenditures, which have made disaster militarism such a
prominent feature of humanitarian relief operations, have not created
more security for individuals, nations, or the planet.]{.underline} The
alternative approach, human security, requires a physical environment
that can support life, guarantees people's material needs for
livelihood, food, and shelter, and protects people and the environment
from avoidable harm. To minimize the impact of climate disasters---and
reduce the contributing factors to the uptick in hurricanes, typhoons,
and big storms---the disaster militarism model must give way to the
human security model as soon as possible.

#### The aff's necessity of the US to act as a transcendent God to save the world from the harm of rogue states deploys hegemonic violence by displacing those who don't follow the mighty and holy liberal democracy

American Culture." In Can We Survive Our Origins?: Readings in René
Girard\'s Theory of Violence and the Sacred Studies in Violence,
Mimesis, & Culture) xx-xx-2015 //pyrex ultra

[American self-understanding has been brutally efficient in producing
"innocent domination"]{.underline} (Pahl 2012b). [Throughout American
history, deathdealing, pursued as a matter of public policy, **has been
cloaked repeatedly in a sacralizing aura of rhetorical innocence.**
According to this "exceptionalist" narrative]{.underline}, usually
asserted in direct contrast to the evidence, [killing is an unfortunate
accident, "collateral damage" in the otherwise noble history of American
progress]{.underline}. **[American domination]{.underline}**, even and
**[especially where violently pursued, is innocent]{.underline}**.
Usually, this [killing is dressed up as "sacrifice," i.e., as heroic and
costly self-dedication to an ideal]{.underline} or value (Denton-Borhaug
2011). The trope is remarkably mobile---and exceptionally slippery in
the semantic ambiguities it generates. [The "sacrifice" of others (and
of American "boys")---]{.underline}implying their bloody immolation
(i.e., sacrifi ce in its archaic and original sense)---has been invoked
as necessary across the centuries (Ebel 2010). **[The removal of Native
Americans, the enslavement of Africans, the conquest of the Spanish in
the South of North America, the revolution against the English across
the 72 Jon Pahl and James Wellman Atlantic seacoast, and the pushback of
the French to what became Canada were all justified,]{.underline}**
already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, **[by rhetorics of
"sacrifice]{.underline}**" ( Jewett 2008). In the nineteenth century[,
the Civil War was described by both sides as a sacrifi cial struggle
"upon the altar of the nation,"]{.underline} as Yale's Harry Stout has
aptly put it (Stout 2006). Most recently, **[the dawn of U.S. empire in
the Philippines, the (belated) entry into World War I, the "good war"
against the Axis Powers in World War II, the "Cold War" against the
Soviet Union and Communist China (via proxies in Korea and Vietnam), and
the military adventures in Iraq (twice) and in Afghanistan were all
shrouded in sacralizing discourses of "sacrifice]{.underline}**"
(**[Stout]{.underline}** 2006). [American interventions have thus always
been presented as exceptional necessities justifying exceptional
measures]{.underline}. Such violence, no matter how sadistic,
"preemptive," and domination-driven, has been cloaked as "defensive"
action, hence as innocent. Domination, so the exceptionalist narrative
goes, is invariably "good" for the peoples Americans have invaded and
fought[.]{.underline} **[Religion]{.underline}** itself **[has been
pressed into service as a key component in an ongoing rationalization of
violence-in-the-name-of-evolutionary-"progress" (progress being
understood in racial, economic, nationalist, and gendered
terms]{.underline}** and marked by potent binaries of "us" versus
"them"). Indeed, **[the production of sacralizing narratives out of
violence tends to institute a civil religion]{.underline}** parallel and
**[rival to Christianity]{.underline}**, operating essentially with
transposed structures of thought and language (mis)appropriated from it.
The thought of René Girard insightfully illuminates this trend in
American history, since for Girard, such phenomena are to be understood
most fundamentally as "regressions" characteristic of Christendom and
its aftermath, to primitive archaic patterns programmed by our
evolutionary history. In his most recent (and probably final) writings,
especially I See Satan Fall Like Lightning; Christianity, Truth, and
Weakening Faith; Evolution and Conversion; and especially Battling to
the End, René Girard has emphasized insistently what he calls his
"realist" approach to anthropology, while also taking a decidedly
theological turn (Girard 2001, 2008, 2010; Girard and Vattimo 2010). For
our purposes, Girard's emphasis, in particular, on the historical
actuality of a "founding murder" at the beginning of human civilization
can point us toward a fully "realist" refusal to blink in the face of
violence, or be deceived by its sacralizing disguises. Girard's
theological turn too can help us Violence and the Sacred in American
Culture 73 to recognize in American history the dynamics of a
paradoxical oscillation, of "apocalyptic" tenor, between a "crescendo
towards extremes" of violence (producing domination) and what Pierpaolo
Antonello has identifi ed as the "containments" of violence (presented
as innocence)---a paradox operating via what Girard calls forms of
"false transcendence" (Girard 2001, 46, 98--100, 119, 185). Th is
"realist theology," if we may so call it, embodies Girard's most mature
refl ections not only on human nature and Christianity, but also on an
American culture that he called "home" for most of his adult life. It is
true that the **[American empire]{.underline}** (as Hardt and Negri
observed \[2008\]) now **[operates as a global regime of transnational
corporate power]{.underline}** (one is tempted to say banking power).
Yet **[the exchanges and flows (of weapons as well as cash) within this
system are]{.underline}** no less, for being global, part of **[a
"sacrifi cial" economy]{.underline}** than they were when tied to the
nation-state and its policies (as is, in fact, still largely the case).
Even more, the capacity of these sacrifi cial processes to produce
victims has escalated, as Girard observes throughout Battling to the
End---while also being at least [temporarily contained in]{.underline}
modern judicial rituals and systems of [economic exchange]{.underline}.
We have to understand here, however, that **[when violence is
"contained," for Girard, it is also redistributed and recycled around
the body politic.]{.underline}** What Girard helps us to realize, then,
is that the system of false transcendence that marks American
exceptionalism takes two primary forms. First, [the ideological
construct of innocent domination operates through overt, physical
warfare rationalized and sanctifi ed as (noble) "sacrifi ce"---at which
construction Americans have proven themselves to be exceptionally
skilled]{.underline}, not least in recent decades. Secondly, [the "false
transcendence" of superordaining necessity and sacralized innocence is
deployed in various forms of "**cultural warfare**.]{.underline}" Here,
the battle is over symbols or "truth" more than actual physical
territory. In these battles, what is "sacrifi ced" is not as evident
(perhaps) as an actual human victim, but these ossifi cations of human
reasoning that produce both the ideology of American exceptionalism and
the false transcendence it secretes are, in the long run, no less
destructive---are, indeed, perhaps more dangerous---than actual warfare.
For ideological rigor mortis is the exact opposite of devotion to a
living God (not to mention devotion to living human beings and
commitment to alleviating their suff ering, insofar as possible). Such
ideological certainty 74 Jon Pahl and James Wellman (which can have the
function of masking a deeper want of assurance) marks a deep-lying
strain in American history from its origins to the present. Of course,
American history is not to be reduced to any single deconstructionist
narrative of anti- or para-Christian American exceptionalism cloaking
domination with innocence through the workings of a false transcendence.
Th ere is also a deep stratum of trust (what Robert Putnam has identifi
ed as "social capital") manifest in spiritually grounded, pragmatically
realistic, nonviolent movements for social change that give some
empirical and cultural "heft " to what Kant long since identifi ed as
the conditions for perpetual peace, and that might collectively point
(ironically enough) to the prospects for a Pax Americana.1 For the
moment, however, we must explore and expand the fruitfulness of the
present exercise in the application of Girardian theory. To which end,
my colleague and I here present a series of four selected
culture-readings, designed to illustrate the logic of sacred and
"sacrifi cial" violence. In Guns We Trust: The Origins of American
Exceptionalism Jon Pahl "**[American" identity,]{.underline}** according
to this reading of the culture-story, **[originated in
murder]{.underline}**. From the very beginning of **[European
settlement,]{.underline}** shifting alliances between indigenous tribal
groupings and English settlers produced competing, and largely
unresolved, charges of murder and injustice. For instance, in 1636 an
English trader named John Oldham was murdered in Massachusetts Bay
Colony. Th e English accused various Native Americans of the crimes. Th
ese accusations were apparently driven less by the facts of the case
than by the benefi ts that accrued to the English from playing on tribal
rivalries that pitted the Mohegans and Narragansetts against the
Pequots. English-speaking clergy preached repeated sermons demanding
that the Pequots punish the murderers of Oldham, and when the Pequots
refused and began carrying out raids on English villages, the English
escalated the confl ict with an attack on the Pequot village in what is
now Mystic, Connecticut, on May 26, 1637. Captain John Mason led a band
of ninety English soldiers, accompanied by several hundred friendly
Violence and the Sacred in American Culture 75 Narragansetts, and
torched the entire village, killing hundreds of Pequots, most of whom
were women, children, and the elderly. Commander of the attack John
Mason explained the religious rationale for the mass murder aft erwards,
claiming that God "laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to
scorn making them as a fi ery Oven. . . . Th us did the Lord judge among
the Heathen, fi lling the Place with dead Bodies!" (Mason 1763, 10). A
few decades later, Nathaniel Morton imagined the scene in vivid terms
for readers, and explicitly justifi ed it as a "sacrifi ce": it "was a
fearful sight to see \[the Pequots\] thus frying in the Fire, and the
streams of Blood quenching the Same; and horrible was the stink and
scent thereof; but the Victory seemed a sweet Sacrifi ce, and they gave
praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to
enclose their Enemies" (Morton 1669, 101). In the coming years, **[New
England's Puritan settlers actually secured their dominance by promising
free trade with various indigenous peoples in exchange for the severed
heads and hands of murdered Pequots as tributes---thus establishing
early connections between religion, violence, and commercial exchange in
the "New World."]{.underline}** And lest the theological point be
lost---namely, that encouraging the murder and dismembering of an enemy
could be an act of love on the part of Christians committed to
Enlightened moral values like not killing---William Bradford of Plymouth
Plantation opined that "cutting off \[Pequot\] heads and hands, which
the \[Indians\] sent to the English, \[was\] a testimony of their love
and service" (Lipman 2008). In the decades to come, the English came to
specialize in this method of dividing and conquering the fi rst peoples
of North America. Th ey did so by using a murder as a pretext for more
killing, although of course the killing was also legitimized by
inquests, trials, and other legal procedures. Th e case of Sassamon---a
"praying Indian" found dead near Plymouth in January of 1675---is the
best-studied example. As a Christian, Sassamon was an ally of the
English, although he also advised Wampanoag sachem Metacom (King
Philip). Th ree Wampanoags were charged with Sassamon's murder, tried in
English courts, and found guilty and sentenced to death. Metacom
protested, and eventually began organizing raids against English
settlements. Th e confl ict escalated into total war---something Girard
comments on with great insight in Battling to the End. Historian Francis
Jennings has estimated 76 Jon Pahl and James Wellman that six of seven
Native Americans and six of thirteen English in New England died during
the war ( Jennings 1976). King Philip's War, as it came to be called,
ended with the death of Metacom in 1677. Aft er being captured by the
English, he was fi rst tortured, then beheaded. His head was then
displayed on a pole in Plymouth for decades. According to Jill Lepore,
the war---triggered by the murder of Sassamon, and ending with the
murder of Metacom---rigidifi ed cultural distinctions between "Indians"
and "Americans," and established a dualistic pattern for cultural confl
ict that defi ned "American" identity (Lepore 1999). **[Murder, war,
torture, destruction---the "sacrifice" of some to preserve others---
these are the themes with which American history ought rightly to
begin.]{.underline}** Throughout the centuries, of course, **[Native
Americans continued to bear much of the violence]{.underline}** that fl
owed from this us-them dualism **[and its sacrifi cial operations---from
the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864]{.underline}** (led by Colonel \[and
Methodist Reverend\] J. M. Chivington), **[to]{.underline}** the
**[Wounded Knee]{.underline}** Massacre of 1890, **[to the repression of
the AIM uprising in 1973, to untold murders and crushing poverty down to
the present.2 All]{.underline}** of this was done, of course, **[in the
name of "progress]{.underline}**"; in the name of the "modern" (if not
putatively "Christian") renunciation of "primitive" religion and ritual.
It would not be diffi cult to trace the way **[this initial incident
spiraled into ideological trajectories that take us quite directly to
Iraq and Abu Ghraib]{.underline}**.3 Instead, however, let us, with
Girard's help, draw out the historical and evolutionary signifi cance of
this "founding murder." He writes: Th e modern shedding of ritual brings
to light the psychosocial substratum of ritual phenomena. We cry
"scapegoat" to stigmatize all the phenomena of
discrimination---political, ethnic, religious, social, racial,
etc.---that we observe about us. We are right. We easily see now that
scapegoats multiply wherever human groups seek to lock themselves into a
given identity--- communal, local, national, ideological, racial,
religious, and so on. (Girard 2001, 160) It is the mobility and
pluriform diversity of the religious phenomenon---the construction,
within the gap created by the "secularization" of inherited traditions,
of hybrid civil religions and of self-sacralizing "cultural religions"
or "identities"---that has marked the modern world. Girard again draws
the Violence and the Sacred in American Culture 77 conclusion: "**[All
discourses on exclusion, discrimination, racism, etc. will remain
superfi cial as long as they don't address the religious foundations of
the problems that besiege our society"]{.underline}** (Girard 2001,
210). I have said something of the religious foundations of American
violence in this brief excursion on the founding murder(s) in American
history. For other case studies in the history of innocent domination,
readers are invited to explore my book Empire of Sacrifi ce (2010a),
which discusses in turn: the execution of the Quaker Mary Dyer on Boston
Common in 1660; the sacrifi ces associated with **[slavery in North
America]{.underline}**, as outlined by Frederick Douglass; **[the
ruthlessly mimetic "war on drugs" that is, in eff ect, a war on youth
and adolescents in American policy; and]{.underline}** (fi nally) **[the
exclusion of women, gays, and lesbians from full participation in
American society]{.underline}**, in what I call the "sacrifi ce of sex."
Each of these trajectories off ers an enduring thread, open to a
Girardian reading, throughout American history; and **[each demonstrates
quite real "sacrifices" of ritual immolation illustrating America's
ideology of innocent domination,]{.underline}** albeit in forms that are
not immediately and evidently identifi able as religious. Other "sacrifi
cial" trajectories of reading in American history are explored in my
previous book, Shopping Malls and Other Sacred Spaces: Putting God in
Place (2003), which tracks the ways shopping malls, Walt Disney World,
or the suburban home---and especially domestic sanitation and lawn
care---originate **[in a "desire to acquire]{.underline}**" in America,
and **[produce]{.underline}** "sacred places" that reinforce what I call
the "**[violence of banality."]{.underline}** But too many examples are
wearisome. Th e point is the same in any event. **[Mimetic rivalries
operate contagiously in America, through market and social systems that
bear religious signifi cance without appearing to be
religious]{.underline}**. In other words, **[innocent domination stems
from a ftranalse transcendence]{.underline}**, the falsity of which is
evidenced by the existence underneath a **[religious rhetoric of
innocence of a brutal, and escalating, system of interrogations,
surveillance, torture, prisons, military expansion, and
weaponry,]{.underline}** the ballistic capacity of which is matched only
by its destructive intent (Bacevich 2010). Unfortunately, the most
troubling and insidious of the forms of innocent domination is the way
in which truth itself suff ers under the fi xed ideology of American
exceptionalism. Th is is the case in the "warfare" between science and
religion in America, which has been concentrated, with special heat, on
the topic of evolution, and which deserves special attention.

exploitative and may be conducive to outbreaks of]{.underline}**
precisely the kind of **[violence]{.underline}** that their theory is
con- cerned with. As intellectually impressive as analytical just war
accounts are, they do not convey any critical sense of Western moralism.
**[It is as though just war theory were written for a different world
than the one we occupy: a world of morally responsible, structurally
unconstrained, roughly equal agents, who have non-complex and
non-exploitative relationships, relationships that lend themselves to
easy epistemic]{.underline}** access **[and binary moral analysis.
Theorists write with a degree of confidence that fails to appreciate the
moral and epistemic fragility of]{.underline}** justified **[war, the
long-term genesis of violent conflict, structural causes of violence and
the moralistic attitudes that politicians and the media are capable of
adopting. To insist that]{.underline}**, in the final analysis, **[the
injustice of wars is]{.underline}** completely **[absorbed by their
being justified reflects a way of doing moral philosophy that is
frighteningly mechanical and sterile. It does not do
justice]{.underline}** to individual persons,59 **[it is nonchalant
about suffering of unimaginable proportions and it suffocates a nuanced
moral world in a rigid binary structure designed to deliver unambiguous,
action-guiding recommendations.]{.underline}** According to the tragic
conception defended here, justified warfare constitutes a moral evil,
not just a physical one -- whatever Coates' aforementioned distinction
is supposed to amount to. **[If we do not recognise the moral evil of
justified warfare, we run the risk of speaking the following kind of
language when talking to a tortured mother, who has witnessed her child
being bombed]{.underline}** into pieces, justifiably let us assume,
**[in the course of a 'just war': See, we did not bomb your toddler into
pieces intentionally. You should also consider that our war was
justified and that]{.underline}**, in performing this particular act of
war, **[we pursued a valid moral goal]{.underline}** of destroying the
enemy's ammunition factory. And be aware that killing your toddler was
not instrumental to that pursuit. **[As you can see, there was nothing
wrong with what we did.]{.underline}** (OR: As you can see, we only
infringed the right of your non-liable child not to be targeted, but we
did not violate it.) Needless to say, we regret your loss. **[This would
be a deeply pathological thing to say, but it is precisely
what]{.underline}** at least **[some contemporary]{.underline}** just
war **[theorists]{.underline}** would **[seem to advise. The
monstrosity]{.underline}** of some accounts of contemporary just war
theory **[seems to derive from]{.underline}** a combination of
**[the]{.underline}** degree of **[certainty with which moral judgments
are offered and the ability to regard the moral case as closed once the
judgments have been made. One implication of my argument for just
theorists is clear enough: they should critically reflect]{.underline}**
**[on the]{.underline}** one-dimensionality of **[their]{.underline}**
dominant **[agenda of making binary moral judgments about
war.]{.underline}** **[If they did, they would become more sympathetic
to the pacifist argument, not to the conclusion drawn by pacifists who
are also caught in a binary mode of thinking (i.e. never wage war,
regardless of the circumstances!) but to the timeless wisdom that forms
the essence of the pacifist argument. It is wrong to knowingly
kill]{.underline}** and maim **[people]{.underline}**, and it does not
matter, at least not as much as the adherents of double effect claim,
whether the killing is done intentionally or 'merely' with foresight.
The difference would be psychological, too. **[Moral philosophers of war
would no longer be forced to concede this moral truth; rather, they
would be free to embrace it. There is no reason for them to disrespect
the essence of pacifism.]{.underline}** The just war theorist Larry May
implicitly offers precisely such a tragic vision in his sympathetic
discussion of 'Grotius and Contingent Pacifism'. According to May, 'war
can sometimes be justified on the same grounds on which certain forms of
pacifism are themselves grounded'.60 If this is correct, **[just war
theorists have good reason to stop calling themselves by their name.
They would no longer be just war theorists, but unjust war theorists,
confronting politicians with a jus contra bellum, rather than offering
them a jus ad bellum. Beyond]{.underline}** being **[that, they would be
much 'humbler in \[their\] approach to considering the justness of
war']{.underline}** (or, rather, the justifiability), **[acknowledging
that:]{.underline}** **[notions of legitimate violence which appear
so]{.underline}** vivid and **[complete to the thinking individual are
only moments and snapshots of a wider history concerning the different
ways in which humans have ordered their]{.underline}** arguments and
**[practices of legitimate violence. Humility in this context does not
mean weakness. It involves a concern with the implicit danger of
adopting an arrogant approach to the problem of war.]{.underline}**61
**[Binary thinking in just war theory is indeed arrogant, as is the
failure to acknowledge the]{.underline}** legitimacy of -- and **[need
for]{.underline}** -- **[ambiguity]{.underline}**, agony **[and doubt
in]{.underline}** moral **[thinking about war.]{.underline}** Humble
philosophers of war, on the contrary, would acknowledge that any talk of
justice is highly misleading in the context of war.62 It does not
suffice here, in my view, to point out that 'we' have always understood
what 'they' meant (assuming they meant what we think they meant).
Fiction aside, **[there is no such thing as a just war.]{.underline}**
There is also no such thing as a morally justified war that comes
without ambiguity and moral remainders. **[Any language of justified
warfare must therefore be]{.underline}** carefully drafted and
**[constantly questioned. It should demonstrate an]{.underline}**
inherent, **[acute awareness of the fragility of moral thinking about
war, rather than an eagerness to construct unbreakable chains of
reasoning.]{.underline}** **[Being uncertain about]{.underline}**, and
agonised by, **[the justifiability of waging war does not put a moral
philosopher to shame. The uncertainty is not only moral, it is also
epistemic. Contemporary just war theorists proceed as if certainty were
the rule]{.underline}**, and uncertainty the exception. **[The world to
which just war theory applies is one of radical and unavoidable
uncertainty]{.underline}** though, **[where politicians]{.underline}**,
voters **[and combatants do not always know who their enemies are;
whether or not they really exist (and if so, why they exist and how they
have come into existence); what weapons the enemies have (if
any);]{.underline}** whether or not, when, and how they are willing to
employ them; **[why exactly the enemies are fought and what the
consequences of fighting or not fighting them will be. Philosophers of
war should]{.underline}** also **[become more sensitive to the problem
of political moralism. The just war language is
dangerous]{.underline}**, particularly when spoken by eager, self-
righteous, over-confident moralists trying to make a case. **[It would
be a pity if philosophers of war, despite having the]{.underline}**
smartest of brains and the **[best of intentions, effectively ended up
delivering rhetorical ammunition to political moralists. To avoid being
inadvertently complicit]{.underline}** in that sense, **[they could
give]{.underline}** public lectures on the dangers of political
moralism, that is, on thinking about war in terms of black and white,
good and evil and them and us. They could warn us against Euro-centrism,
missionary zeal and the emperors' moralistic clothes. They could also
**[investigate the historical genesis and structural conditionality
of]{.underline}** large-scale **[aggressive behaviour in the global
arena]{.underline}**, deconstruct- ing how warriors who claim to be
justified are potentially tied into histories and structures, asking
them: Who are you to make that claim? A philosopher determined **[to go
beyond the narrow discursive parameters provided by the
contemporary]{.underline}** just war **[paradigm would surely embrace
some]{.underline}**thing like Marcus' 'second-order **[regulative
principle', which could indeed lead to '"better"
policy'.]{.underline}**63 If justified wars are unjust and if it is true
that not all tragedies of war are authentic, then political agents ought
to prevent such tragedies from occurring. **[This demanding
principle]{.underline}**, however, **[may require a more fundamental
reflection on how we 'conduct our lives and arrange our
institutions']{.underline}** (Marcus) **[in this world. It is not enough
to adopt a 'wait and see' policy, simply waiting for potential
aggressions to occur and making sure that we do not go to war unless
doing so is a 'last resort'. Large-scale violence between human beings
has causes that go beyond]{.underline}** the **[individual moral
failure]{.underline}** of those who are potentially aggressing, **[and
if]{.underline}** it turns out that some of **[these causes can be
removed 'through more careful decision-making']{.underline}** (Lebow),
**[then this is what ought to be done]{.underline}** by those who
otherwise deprive themselves, today, of the possibility of not wronging
tomorrow.

#### Arms sales are merely a part of the totalizing violence of the military industrial complex \-\-- the affirmative tries to regulate a part that just empowers the whole 

\[Bill **Van Auken 12**\] (The tripling of US arms sales." World

//pyrex ultra

**[The [tripling of US arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[abroad to a
record \$66.3 billion is an accurate barometer of the accelerating drive
to war]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf and on a world scale. [This one
violently surging sector of American exports reflects]{.mark}** a
diseased capitalist economy and society, whose financial-corporate elite
resorts to **[militarism as a means of offsetting the overall economic
decline of the United States]{.mark}. The annual survey of global arms
sales released this week by the Congressional Research
Service**]{.underline} (CRS), the policy research arm of the US
Congress, **[places the United States number one in the provision of
advanced weaponry to the world by an overwhelming margin.]{.underline}**
"In 2011, the US led in arms transfer agreements worldwide, making
agreements valued at \$66.3 billion (77.7 percent of all such
agreements), an extraordinary increase from \$21.4 billion in 2010. The
US worldwide agreements total in 2011 is the largest for a single year
in the history of the US arms export program," according to the report
prepared for Congress. In an earlier period, Washington justified such
weapons deals as part of its Cold War strategy of countering the
influence of the Soviet Union and propping up regimes aligned with the
West against Moscow and its allies. This was under conditions where
Soviet arms sales to the so-called Third World rivaled and even
surpassed those of the United States. **[Today]{.underline}**, however,
as the CRS report makes clear, **[the US accounts for more than three
quarters of global arms deals]{.underline}**, with the share of its
closest competitor, Russia, amounting to just 5.6 percent. **[The
massive rise in US arms sales is driven by the accelerating turn toward
aggressive war as a means of achieving the strategic global objectives
of US imperialism, combined with the insatiable drive for profit and
power by America's bloated military-industrial complex.]{.underline}**
The lion's share of the rise in arms exports is directed to **[Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}** (UAE), which
**[together account for \$38.2 billion of the \$66.3 billion total. The
other major sales were \$2 billion worth of antimissile batteries to
Taiwan]{.underline}**---a provocative move aimed against China---**[and
\$6.9 billion in arms to India]{.underline}**, ratcheting up tensions
with its regional antagonist, Pakistan. The Saudi monarchy's purchase of
84 advanced F-15 fighter planes together with dozens of military
helicopters and other weapons yielded super profits for Boeing and
United Technologies. The regime in the UAE obtained a \$3.5 billion
sophisticated missile defense system, providing rich returns for
Lockheed Martin. The CRS report includes the observation: "**[[Whereas
the principal motivation for arms sales by key foreign suppliers in
earlier years might have been to support a foreign policy objective,
today that motivation may be based as much, if not more, on economic
considerations]{.mark} as those of foreign or national security
policy."]{.underline}** [**In reality, these foreign policy objectives
and economic interests feed each other. The** military-industrial
complex]{.underline} that the former general Dwight D. Eisenhower warned
against at the end of his presidency a half-century ago [**has grown**
to gargantuan proportions, dominating the US government **and both major
parties and playing a grossly disproportionate role in the American
economy. It provides a powerful impetus to both militarism abroad and
the assault on democratic rights at home. The** purchases **by the**
monarchical regimes in the Arab world stem]{.underline}, on the one
hand, from their reaction to the popular upheavals that were dubbed the
"Arab Spring" and, on the other, **[from the buildup by the US and its
allies for another war]{.underline}**, this time against Iran. The House
of Saud, which runs Saudi Arabia as a family fiefdom, saw in the events
in Tunisia, Egypt and particularly Bahrain, where its troops were used
to suppress mass protests, a mortal threat to its absolutist rule. An
essential part of its response is the dramatic expansion of its military
apparatus. **[The buildup to war against Iran, just as the one that
preceded the war of aggression against Iraq a decade ago, has been
publicly justified as a response to the supposed threat posed by
"weapons of mass destruction."]{.underline}** The US and its allies have
claimed that Iran's nuclear program is directed at producing nuclear
weapons, a charge repeatedly denied by the government in Iran, which
insists the program is for peaceful purposes. **[The hypocrisy of these
charges against Iran, which have provided the pretext for ~~crippling~~
sanctions, the deployment of a US air and sea armada in the Persian
Gulf, and threats by Israel and the US of an unprovoked military
assault, is evident in the figures provided by the US arms sales report.
The amount of weaponry Washington sold to the Saudi and UAE regimes
alone last year amounted to nearly six times Iran's entire military
budget.]{.underline}** The US geo-strategic objective in sponsoring
these weapons sales is to create potently armed regional proxies for a
war for regime-change in Iran. This process is already playing out in
Syria, where Washington's major arms customers---Saudi Arabia and the
UAE---are openly sponsoring the so-called rebels seeking the overthrow
of Iran's principal Arab ally, the government of Bashar al-Assad.
**[This sponsorship has extended to the creation of a \$100 million fund
to pay the salaries of the militias challenging the Syrian government,
as well as the provision of weapons, which is being coordinated by the
CIA in Turkey and undoubtedly on the ground in Syria itself. The
preparations for war against Iran are directed at tightening US hegemony
over the energy-rich regions of the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea,
which the landmass of Iran spans]{.underline}**. In that sense, the
aggression being prepared against Iran and its people under Obama is in
pursuit of the same aims that underlay the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
launched under Bush. **[The arms industry is massively subsidized by the
American taxpayer.]{.underline}** While the political establishment and
media insist "there is no money" when it comes to jobs, decent wages,
education and vital public services, [endless billions are lavished on
America's merchants of death. **[American working people neither share
in this industry's state-subsidized profits nor have any say over its
sale of powerful weapons systems to reactionary regimes]{.mark}. Just as
mass opposition emerged to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is
similar popular hostility to arming the Saudi and UAE monarchs to the
teeth, not to mention being dragged into yet another war, this time
against Iran. The disappearance of any mass protest against war is a
reflection**]{.underline} not of popular sentiment, but rather [**of
the** reactionary politics **of a [privileged middle class layer of
pseudo-lefts that deliberately worked to channel anti-war sentiment
behind Obama and the Democratic Party. A new mass ]{.mark}**[movement
against war **can be built only through an irreconcilable** break **with
the Democratic Party and the US two-party syste**]{.mark}**m. What is
required is the** independent political mobilization of the working
class on the basis of a socialist program, including the conversion of
the arms industry into publicly owned facilities dedicated to production
for human needs rather than mass slaughter.]{.underline}

### Colonialism 

#### Arms Control Regulation always frame technologies through the need to regulate "rogue states" which always frame a need for an interventionist colonialism which intensifies the violence in those regions

\[Anna **Starvianakis 16**\] (Legitimizing liberal militarism: politics,
law and war in the Arms Trade Treaty. Third World Quarterly, 37 (5). pp.
840-865. ISSN 0143-6597) xx-xx-2016 //pyrex ultra

[The emerging scholarly assessment of the ATT is clear that
international action to regulate the arms trade is an unprecedented
effort at norm creation and one of the most ambitious and difficult
goals to achieve in global governance. It grows out of existing arms
control, disarmament and arms transfer control regimes. Extant arms
control or disarmament regimes that ban **specific technologies** such
as landmines, cluster munitions, chemical and nuclear weapons, have all
relied on their being framed as **indiscriminate**, inhumane,
unacceptable or pariah in some way, thus challenging states abilities to
produce, use or transfer them as part of legitimate military need and
state security practice.]{.underline}15 [The difficulty with regulating
the conventional arms trade as a whole, as the ATT attempts to do, is
that it does not lend itself to such framing due to the centrality of
the arms trade to state security and sovereignty, and hence widespread
legitimacy]{.underline}.16 [Any multilateral action on the trade in
conventional weapons as a whole thus has to take the form of
**regulation** rather than abolition or a **ban**. The ATT is both
emblematic of, and distinct from, the post-Cold War nonproliferation
paradigm]{.underline}.17 For example, [there is specific mention of
terrorism as an ill to be combated, and a framing around the illicit and
unregulate trade; yet it applies to a broad range of military equipment,
and does not generate a taboo or ban on particular types of
technologies.]{.underline} As such[, it may be able to serve to draw
attention to the patterns of civilian death and injury associated with
technologies considered normal or the use of which is somehow seen as
inevitable One way this is envisaged is through inclusion not only of
the laws of war under existing IHL, but also the inclusion of human
rights provisions. This human security content of the treaty secured
widespread agreement, with the reduction of human suffering explicitly
named as a goal of the treaty. The treaty means different things to the
various constituencies involved in the campaign and negotiating
processes; indeed, this was a necessary condition for its
agreement.]{.underline} [It is as much about trade
regulation]{.underline} (according to supportive government and industry
representatives) [as arms transfer control]{.underline} (as most
proponent NGOs would have it), with only minority voices such as the
Womens International League for Peace and Freedom, WILPF) [articulating
a disarmament agenda. And this is quite aside from the vocal hostility
of US-based campaign groups and think-tanks such as the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and Heritage Foundation on unilateralist and Second
Amendment grounds, and the scepticism]{.underline} (e.g. China, India
and Russia) [and opposition]{.underline} (e.g. Iran, North Korea and
Syria) [of some non-western states on substantive and/or procedural
grounds.19 Overall, the treaty represents the confluence of arms
control, security, human rights, trade, armed violence, sovereignty,
development, self-defence, technology, and other issue and its
widely-drawn provisions must be applied in an innumerable number of
different factual contexts ... which take shape as the treaty is applied
in practice.ǳ21 As experience from international action on small arms
has shown, the problems posed by the arms trade are of a different
character in different parts of the world: small arms are an issue of
recirculation post-conflict in West Africa, of excessive stocks in
southeast Europe, and of criminal activity and drug trafficking in Latin
America and the CARICOM region.]{.underline} And notes of caution have
been sounded by more radical campaign groups: to ensure the ATT makes a
difference, states, civil society and UN must avoid legitimizing further
the international arms trade and irresponsible transfers[. But limits of
the treaty aside, most agree that we have to start somewhere and push
for robust interpretation and effective implementation]{.underline} 24
[The ATT is seen by proponents as a step forward in the development of
norms around the protection of human security, and potentially
generative of a norm cascade such that it will have an effect even on
non-signatories]{.underline}.25 [This chimes with the academic
literature on norms, which makes the case for the possibility of moral
progress in international politics and a rising tide of principled
action.]{.underline} The UK government is seen as having humanitarian,
developmental and moral justification or motivation for exercising
leadership on the ATT, according to norms scholar Denise Garcia.26 As an
example of disarmament diplomac, the ATT signals the way in which the
rise of norms based on moral concerns can change conduct in
international politics:[The creation of new international norms
transforms deeply held practices and changes behavior]{.underline}. 28
[This is resonant with a common theme within the constructivist norms
literature that norms co-exist with and sometimes trump material and
strategic concerns, requiring a move beyond interest-based
explanations.2]{.underline}9 As Price puts it, almost [any international
treaty dealing with subjects such as human rights or war would seem to
be a mix of the brutal bargaining of national interests and coercion
sprinkle, if not always enveloped, with other, including moral,
considerations]{.underline} 30 At first blush, then, we cannot
understand the entry into force of the ATT without the role of human
security norms. [However, whilst the circulation of norms around human
security was a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the
agreement and content of the treaty, the character of the explanation
given by a constructivist norms account is limited. Norms are supposed
to facilitate more progressive standards of behaviour through, for
example, the rhetorical entrapment and shaming involved in hypocrite and
a constructivist approach is supposed to illuminate the nuances of
progressive and regressive effects of even strategically moral uses of
morality.]{.underline} [But existing norms based accounts of the ATT
have taken at face value the moral representations of leading liberal
states, as seen in Garcias equation of justifications with
motivations.32 And broader constructivist accounts of weapons activism
have not tackled the ongoing patterns across the spectrum of weapons
transfers, outside of the banning of specific technologies. Carpenters
insightful analysis of the question of why some weapons systems are
targeted for delegitimation and not others brackets the wider system of
war preparation of which the development of weapons systems is a
part]{.underline}.33 Constructivist arguments implicitly assume that
progressive change in the area of weapons issues can come from
delegitimating one technology at a time. Yet broader systems of war
preparation and war fighting will always generate new technologies. And
as ) argue later, [liberal states war practices are kept off the agenda
through risk assessment processes and legitimating claims based on a
universalizing morality. Claims about the normative power of
conventional arms transfer control regimes have been sternly tested by
empirical studies. Studies of patterns of arms exports demonstrate how
theself-declared ethical turn of major western arms suppliers in the
1990s has not acted as a bar on weapons exports.]{.underline}34 [The US
and Western European states have generally not exercised export controls
so as to discriminate against human rights abusing or autocratic
countries during the post-Cold War period.]{.underline} At best, the
effect of the EU Code of Conduct, which served as one of the templates
for the ATT, has been thatEU members no longer appear to reward poor
human rights with arms transfers, even if they are not punishing it
either 36 [And in specific cases such as EU member states arms transfers
to Libya, evidence demonstrates comprehensive violation of export
control principles even though exporting governments were aware of the
risks posed by transfers: license denials \"constitute exceptions in an
overall export-friendly environment.ǳ37 These empirical patterns raise
the question of how liberal states manage to both transfer weapons to
human rights violating and authoritarian regimes, and claim the mantle
of responsibility by being publicly in favour of the ATT. The empirical
studies cited above tend to adopt a realist explanation in which
seemingly normatively progressive regimes serve as rhetorical cover for
material or strategic interests,38 yet they do not go into detail as to
how that process works. **Realist** explanations are inadequate because
they fail to take into account the hard work that such rhetoric performs
or the way that regimes function often despite the good intention of
some proponents.39 Law and regulation are not merely superficial cover,
a distraction from a focus on the advancement of material interests:
lawdoes matter; that is both the problem and the
promise.]{.underline}ǳ40 [Thus whilst constructivists are right that
rationalist assumptions of narrowly instrumental behaviour are false,41
they do not give an adequate explanation of the significance of the
morally oriented work that is going on in the ATT: the ways in which a
seemingly progressive initiative contains the seeds of its own
complicity in broader systems of preparation for war and violence. Yet
Price does point to how,if hypocrisy becomes too endemic then it may
undercut the power of the moral legitimacy more generally that is
required for hypocrisys piggy-back effects. 42 So it may be that arms
transfers are so embedded in hypocrisy that normative shaming is less
effective.]{.underline} As Erickson argues, the ATT faces a hard road
ahead: without the means to expose and punish noncompliance, ...
\[ambitious policies\] do little more than enhance states reputations
without improving human rights and conflict conditions on the ground 43
[Yet Research explaining major suppliers support for responsible arms
export controls is lacking 44 --To start thinking about this gap between
commitment and compliance, and to explain major suppliers positions, I
advance the concept of **liberal militarism**. This moves beyond
arguments based on hypocrisy and instrumental or functional pursuit of
material interests, in order to explain key effects of the treaty in
ways other approaches cannot. The normalization and legitimation of
liberal ways of war and war preparation via the ATT are an important
component of contemporary militarism. The concept of militarism,
understood as the social and international relations of the preparation
for, and conduct of, organized political violence,45 allows us to
examine the historical, socio-economic and political sources and
character of military power.]{.underline}46 Understood this way, [the
concept goes beyond a definition of militarism as ideology, and
militarisation as the material process through which militarism comes
about. Militarism includes an ideological component but is not
restricted to it, because war and armed violence can be justified and
facilitated even if not necessarily glorified; and because social forces
beyond ideology are required to produce it. Arms transfers and arms
transfer control may thus contribute to militarisation]{.underline} ([an
increase in the intensity of military power in society, whether domestic
or international]{.underline}), [demilitarisation]{.underline} (a
decrease), [or a change in the character of militarism. The concept
allows for the analysis of the different forms across space and time
taken by war and preparation for it.47 And whilst the number of deaths
caused by the arms trade is clearly an important yardstick, a militarism
frame goes beyond numbers.]{.underline} [Rather, it captures the
influence of military relations on social relations in general, and the
ways that war and armed violence are prepared for. This requires
broadening the empirical focus beyond conflict in Africa and organized
crime in Latin America, which have been the main focus for arms transfer
control.]{.underline} [Scholars are increasingly challenging the long-
and widely cherished belief that liberalism and militarism are
antithetical.48 Key features of the specificity of liberal militarism
include the capital- and technology-intensive character of the
preparation for and conduct of war; a strong commitment to military
production across war and peacetime and self-understanding as a
primarily economic, industrial and commercial power the distanced form
of attacks on Southern populations and simultaneous containment of
social conflict at home and policing empire abroad, often featuring
supposedly small massacres; a universalist ideology and conception of
world order; low levels of military participation by society; and a
state-capital relation that is formally separate but organically
related.49 Justifications based on values and morals promoting human
rights and humanitarian values are central to legitimating these
features of liberal militarism, and are in contrast to the
justifications based on sovereignty of other major, non-liberal
suppliers and recipients such as Russia, China and India. In the case of
the ATT, language and regulatory bureaucratic practices of risk
assessment are embedded in western, liberal regimes that on paper
already exceed the standards set out in the ATT.]{.underline}

### Endless War

#### Arms Control Regimes always make the move to sovereignty in light that they are the heart of the violence which creates a endless war through neo-modern militarism \-\-- this turns great power war impacts

\[Anna **Stravriankis 18**\] (Controlling weapons circulation in a
postcolonial militarised world, University of Sussex, Review of
International Studies) 5-21-2018 //pyrex ultra

[There are thus continuities of imperial forms of practice despite the
turn to formal sovereignty. A focus on the systematic or organised and
North-South character of much armed violence is not to return to Cold
War politics or the "sterile polemic" of past debates about weapons
issues mentioned earlier.]{.underline} Rather, [it is to emphasise that
historical weapons supply routes and power relations continue to
resonate; that massive and uneven levels of global military spending and
proxy wars continue to matter; and that clients continue to use weapons
in ways that are often unanticipated by patrons.]{.underline}
[Ostensibly civil or internal wars are enmeshed in wider regional and
international projects.53 There are internationalised sources of much of
what counts as domestic, civil or intra-state, including colonial
legacies and internationalised weapons supply chains.]{.underline} In
many accounts[, human security has been mobilised as an attempt to "cope
with \[the\] pathological results" of how security has been defined in
post-colonial states in the South.]{.underline}54 Yet [this encourages
internalist analysis that sees the problems of armed violence as having
their sources primarily within the global South. In conceding the terms
of debate to "traditional" security studies, and seeking to shift
inwards from the state to the individuals living within it, rather than
critiquing the conception of the international system, the human
security agenda continues to "occlude and distort imperial relations" in
the way that more traditional "Westphalian terms of reference"
do]{.underline}.55 [In the human security agenda's account of the shift
from wars between states to wars within them, war falls off the agenda
as it is deemed analytically outdated and politically regressive. Yet
neo-realist, Cold War accounts of national security were never adequate,
and in trying to overcome them, many human security accounts take them
at face value and get the critique wrong. With its emphasis on the
enduring power of war preparation, the concept of **militarism**
suggests that much contemporary violence remains coordinated or
facilitated (**by state**, paramilitary, militia or other organised
actors), and systematic within society, despite the shift towards
discussion of armed violence and intentional homicide, which is
suggestive of disorganised violence. So how are we to mobilise the
concept of militarism in light of the imperial turn, in ways that help
us think more productively about weapons control? First is to defend the
use of the concept at all.]{.underline} According to Mary Kaldor, [the
concept of militarism has outlived its usefulness as it is "drawn from
the Cold War and before:" the changes with the end of the Cold War
necessitate new terms.]{.underline}56 [To capture the ways that
organised violence blurs state/non-state and national/foreign
boundaries, whether in the form of paramilitary groups, organised crime
or terrorist cells, or in the form of peacekeeping troops, Kaldor coins
the terms "Netforce" and "Protectionforce" respectively.57 She restricts
the concept of militarism to "the new American militarism" and the
"neo-modern militarism"]{.underline} ("the evolution of classical
military forces in large transition states" practising inter-state war
or counter-insurgency) [of states such as **Russia**, **China** and
**India**.58 But in differentiating some types of organised violence as
notmilitarism, we lose the opportunity to compare them, to see the
overlaps, similarities and differences in modes of organised violence.
Feminists have long been able to capture this with the concept of
militarism, showing us that "it is not quite so easy to set aside
'ordinary' aggression, force or violence as 'not war'"59 -- especially
when we pay attention to the experience of violence in the global
South.]{.underline}Second, and relatedly, [the specificities of
combinations of actors, degrees of state support, and so on, are subject
to empirical and historical specificity, and a common rubric of
militarism helps us understand similarities and differences between
them.]{.underline} [Working in a historical sociological tradition,
Mabee and Vucetic draw up a typology of forms of contemporary
militarism. 61 They contrast Michael Mann's concept of civil society
militarism - "the use of organized military violence in pursuit of
social goals that is 'state-supported, but not state-led'" 62 - to
"nation-state militarism" in both its authoritarian and liberal forms;
to "neoliberal militarism" structured around socioeconomic
liberalisation; and to "exceptionalist militarism" seen in practices
associated with the War on Terror.]{.underline} Feminists tend not to
operate in such formal typological ways, [but have long been
articulating the idea of war and militarism as a spectrum or a system,
in which the forms, intensities and characteristics may vary, but the
gendered basis of violence is central.]{.underline}63 [And a focus on
militarism can be usefully mobilised to consider the connections and
feedback loops between Northern and Southern practices, giving a more
internationalised account that is better attuned to the operation of
power in contexts of armed violence.]{.underline} Indeed, [Abrahamsen
refers to "global militarism in Africa" because "while militarism is
always specific (and often national), it is also simultaneously global,"
and the analytical challenge is to capture at one and the same time the
global and the local, and their intersection in particular
locations."]{.underline}64 Third, [whilst I want to defend the concept,
and think about types of militarism in relation to each other, it is
crucial to acknowledge that contemporary militarism and human security
have shaped each other in the last twenty years. Human security, with
its emphasis on human rights and IHL, has become a mediating element in
the relation between war and society. Post-Cold War processes of
democratisation have "often coincided with new forms of militarism" that
tend to be analysed under the rubric of policy-oriented concepts such as
security sector reform.]{.underline}65 As Abrahamsen argues, "[The
securitization of underdevelopment ... is the condition of possibility
for a global militarism justified in the name of human security and
development."]{.underline}66 We must take heed of Abrahamsen's warning
that "[Paradoxically, transformations that initially entailed a critique
of militarization and militarism have ended up according a new
importance to security actors and laying the groundwork for new
expressions of militarization and militarism."]{.underline}67 [Human
security has -- against its self-image as a progressive social force --
facilitated a resurgent as well as transformed militarism.]{.underline}

### Imperalism

#### The ideology of military aid is no longer material but [ideological]{.underline} \-\-- removing the arms just perpetuates the need for placing the "west is best" ideology in more non-western countries

\[Eric **Posner 14**\] (The Case Against Human Rights, Professor at the
University of Chicago Law School,
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/04/-sp-case-against-human-rights.
The Guardian.) 12-4-2014 //pyrex ultra

In his influential book The White Man's Burden, William Easterly argues
that much of [the foreign-aid establishment is in the grip of an
ideology that is a softer-edge version of the civilising mission of
19th-century imperialists. Westerners no longer believe that white
people are superior to other people on racial grounds, but they do
believe that regulated markets, the rule of law and liberal democracy
are superior to the systems that prevail in non-western countries, and
they have tried to implement those systems in the developing world.
Easterly himself does not oppose regulated markets and liberal
democracy]{.underline}, nor does he oppose foreign aid. [He instead
attacks the ideology of the "planners" -- people who believe that the
west can impose a political and economic blueprint that will advance
wellbeing in other countries.]{.underline} Since the second world war,
western countries contributed trillions of dollars of aid to developing
countries. The aid has taken many different forms: unrestricted cash,
loans at below-market interest rates, cash that must be used to buy
western products, in-kind projects such as dams and plants, technical
assistance, education and "rule-of-law" projects designed to improve the
quality of legal institutions. For a while, the "Washington consensus"
imposed cookie-cutter market-based prescriptions on countries that
needed to borrow money. The consensus among economists is that these
efforts have failed. The reasons are varied. Giving cash and loans to a
government to build projects such as power plants will not help the
country if government officials skim off a large share and give
contracts to cronies incapable of implementing those projects. Providing
experts to improve the legal infrastructure of the country will not help
if local judges refuse to enforce the new laws because of corruption or
tradition or incompetence. [Pressuring governments to combat corruption
will not help if payoffs to mob bosses, clan chiefs, or warlords are
needed to maintain social order. Demanding that aid recipients use money
in ways that they believe unnecessary can encourage governments to evade
the conditions of the donations.]{.underline} The Washington consensus
failed because economic reform requires the consent of the public, and
populations resented the imposition by foreigners of harsh policies that
were not always wise on their own terms. [International human rights law
reflects the same top-down mode of implementation, pursued in the same
crude manner.]{.underline} But human rights law has its distinctive
features as well. [Because it is law, it requires the consent of states,
creating an illusion of symmetry and even-handedness that is missing
from foreign aid. Hence the insistence, wholly absent from discussions
about foreign aid, that western countries are subject to international
human rights law as other countries are. However, in practice,
international human rights law does not require western countries to
change their behaviour, while]{.underline} (in principle) [it requires
massive changes in the behaviour of most non-western countries. Both
foreign aid and human rights enforcement can be corrupted or undermined
because western countries have strategic interests that are not always
aligned with the missions of those institutions. But the major problem,
in both cases, is that the systems reflect a vision of good governance
rooted in the common historical experiences of western countries and
that prevails]{.underline} (albeit only approximately) [in countries
that enjoy wealth, security and order. There is no reason that this
vision -- the vision of institutionally enforced human rights -- is
appropriate for poor countries, with different traditions, and facing a
range of challenges that belong, in the view of western countries, to
the distant past.]{.underline} Development economics has gone some
distance to curing itself of this error. The best development scholars
today, such as Esther Duflo, have been experimenting furiously with
different ways of improving lives of people living in foreign countries.
Rigorous statistical methods are increasingly used, and in recent years
economists have implemented a range of randomised controlled trials.
Much greater attention is paid to the minutiae of social context, as it
has become clear that a vaccination programme that works well in one
location may fail in another, for reasons relating to social order that
outsiders do not understand. Expectations have been lowered; [the goal
is no longer to convert poor societies into rich societies, or even to
create market institutions and eliminate corruption; it is to help a
school encourage children to read in one village, or to simplify lending
markets in another. It is time to start over with an approach to
promoting wellbeing in foreign countries that is empirical rather than
ideological. Human rights advocates can learn a lot from]{.underline}
the experiences of development economists -- [not only about the flaws
of top-down, coercive styles of forcing people living in other countries
to be free, but about how one can actually help those people if one
really wants to.]{.underline} Wealthy countries can and should provide
foreign aid to developing countries, but with the understanding that
[helping other countries is not the same as forcing them to adopt
western institutions, modes of governance, dispute-resolution systems
and rights. Helping other countries means giving them cash, technical
assistance and credit where there is reason to believe that these forms
of aid will raise the living standards of the poorest
people.]{.underline} Resources currently used in fruitless efforts to
compel foreign countries to comply with the byzantine, amorphous treaty
regime would be better used in this way. [With the benefit of hindsight,
we can see that the human rights treaties were not so much an act of
idealism as an act of hubris, with more than a passing resemblance to
the civilising efforts undertaken by western governments and missionary
groups in the 19th century, which did little good for native populations
while entangling European powers in the affairs of countries they did
not understand. A humbler approach is long overdue.]{.underline}

### Militarism

#### Controlling the type of weapons that should be circulation enacts a militaristic colonialism \-\-- enforcing a need for military presence 

\[Anna **Stravriankis 18**\] (Controlling weapons circulation in a
postcolonial militarised world, University of Sussex, Review of
International Studies) 5-21-2018 //pyrex ultra

The disagreements and silences of the ATT negotiations demonstrate the
ways in which [weapons circulation and regulation are marked by
different forms of militarism. The human security agenda has made
significant inroads to international public policy and social science
scholarship, and was an explicit driver of the ATT.]{.underline} [Whilst
there is much in the treaty that optimists see as having the potential
to better control the circulation of weapons, the argument put forward
in this article is that it is a mistake to see the treaty as a victory
for human security over militarism. Rather, human security has both
chipped away at some of the most egregious manifestations of militarism,
been silent on others, and proved to be an accommodation with global
militarism in its various forms. Human security, political economy and
sovereignty came into contestation during the negotiations as
expressions of different modes of militarism. Weapons circulation takes
places within a system: there is a world arms market (including legal
and illicit strands) marked by asymmetry, hierarchy and
transnationalpractices, in which many major exporting states that claim
to care about human security, in particular European states, already
participate in regimes based on ATT-like principles.]{.underline} [Those
that don't, or are ambivalent about such multilateralism -- in
particular Russia and China, and the USA, respectively -- are sceptical
about claims made on the basis of human rights and IHL. Claims to
protect human security disconnect human rights and IHL violations from
these patterns of military asymmetry and hierarchy, and generate
resistance from non-liberal suppliers and recipients. So the human
security agenda rests on the assumption that international politics can
remain militarised in one way (the absence of efforts at disarmament or
tackling military spending or military asymmetry) and yet be
demilitarised in another (efforts to decrease the likelihood that
weapons will be used in human rights or IHL violations), in ways that
the examples discussed above suggest are untenable.]{.underline}
[Resistance to the ATT from a significant minority of Southern states
may well be politically ugly, but needs to be understood in the context
of asymmetry in the world military order, as does US dominance of the
negotiations for a treaty to which it is a signatory but not a State
Party. In the desire to promote the spread of human security practices,
there has been little attention to why an initiative such as the ATT
might be resisted, beyond narrowly strategic or instrumental concerns or
a failure to internalise human security norms. Thinking about modes of
militarism, and the ways in which the human security agenda has
transformed, but not necessarily diminished, militarism, can help us
think more creatively, both analytically and politically, about what is
at stake. We need to understand and explain patterns of militarism
because of the paradoxical role of military power and systematic or
organised violence in international relations.]{.underline} [On the one
hand, military power has historically been fundamental to the
constitution of organised political power, be it in the form of the
state or otherwise. On the other hand, demilitarisation from current
levels and forms is a condition for improved human security. A
contraction of the influence of the "social relations, institutions and
values" of war and war preparation on social relations, institutions and
values more generally 120 reduces the likelihood of violent responses to
political problems, reduces the secrecy and corruption associated with
military decisions or military involvement in the economy, and lowers
the opportunity costs associated with high levels of military spending,
to name a few reasons. But militarism has been pushed off the agenda,
precisely because it strikes at the core issues around war preparation
and the constitution of political community and political economy, and
because the maintenance of coercive capacities in the South is central
to aid donors' and Southern elites' interests, not to mention the
entrenched coercive orientation of Northern states' foreign
policies.]{.underline}

### Laundry List

#### Neoliberal capitalism leads to extinction -- the system reproduces crises that undermine future thinking, and leads to environmental collapse, endless war, and the rise of fascism

\[Steven **Shaviro 2015**\] ("No Speed Limit: Three Essays on
Accelerationism", Steven Shaviro is an American academic, philosopher
and cultural critic whose areas of interest include film theory, time,
science fiction, panpsychism, capitalism, affect and subjectivity. He
earned a PhD from Yale in 1981, <https://track5.mixtape.moe/qdkkdt.pdf>)

The problem may be summarized as follows. [Capitalism has indeed created
the conditions for general prosperity and therefore for its own
supersession. But it has also blocked, and continues to block, any hope
of realizing this transformation. We cannot wait for capitalism to
transform on its own, but we also cannot hope to progress by appealing
to some radical Outside or by fashioning ourselves as militants faithful
to some "event" that]{.underline} (as Badiou has it) [would mark a
radical and complete break with the given "situation" of
capitalism.]{.underline} Accelerationism rather demands a movement
against and outside capitalism---but on the basis of tendencies and
technologies that are intrinsic to capitalism. [Audre Lord famously
argued that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's
house." But what if the master's tools are the only ones
available?]{.underline} Accelerationism grapples with this dilemma. What
is the appeal of [accelerationism]{.underline} today? It [can be
understood as a response to the particular social and political
situation in which we currently seem to be trapped: that of a long-term,
slow-motion catastrophe**. Global warming, and environmental pollution
and degradation, threaten to undermine our whole mode of
life.**]{.underline} [And this mode of life is itself increasingly
stressful and precarious, due to the depredations of neoliberal
capitalism.]{.underline} As Fredric Jameson puts it, [the world today is
characterized by "heightened polarization, increasing unemployment,
\[and\] the ever more desperate search for new investments and new
markets."]{.underline} These are all general features of capitalism
identified by Marx, but in neoliberal society we encounter them in a
particularly pure and virulent form. I want to be as specific as
possible in my use of the term "neoliberalism" in order to describe this
situation. I define neoliberalism as a specific mode of capitalist
production (Marx), and form of governmentality (Foucault), that is
characterized by the following specific factors: 1. The dominating
influence of financial institutions, which facilitate transfers of
wealth from everybody else to the already extremely wealthy (the "One
Percent" or even the top one hundredth of one percent). 2. The
privatization and commodification of what used to be common or public
goods (resources like water and green space, as well as public services
like education, communication, sewage and garbage disposal, and
transportation). 3. The extraction, by banks and other large
corporations, of a surplus from all social activities: not only from
production (as in the classical Marxist model of capitalism) but from
circulation and consumption as well. [Capital accumulation proceeds not
only by direct exploitation but also by rent-seeking, by debt
collection, and by outright expropriation]{.underline} ("primitive
accumulation"). 4. [The subjection of all aspects of life to the
so-called discipline of the market. This is equivalent]{.underline}, in
more traditional Marxist terms[, to the "real subsumption" by capital of
all aspects of life: leisure as well as labor.]{.underline} Even our
sleep is now organized in accordance with the imperatives of production
and capital accumulation. 5. The redefinition of human beings as private
owners of their own "human capital." [Each person is
thereby]{.underline}, as Michel Foucault puts it, [forced to become "an
entrepreneur of himself."]{.underline} In such circumstances, we are
continually obliged to market ourselves, to "brand" ourselves, to
maximize the return on our "investment" in ourselves. There is never
enough: like the Red Queen, we always need to keep running, just to stay
in the same place. [Precarity is the fundamental condition of our lives.
All of these processes work on a global scale; they extend far beyond
the level of immediate individual experience. My life is precarious, at
every moment, but I cannot apprehend the forces that make it so. I know
how little money is left from my last paycheck, but I cannot grasp, in
concrete terms, how "the economy" works. I directly experience the daily
weather, but I do not directly experience the climate. Global warming
and worldwide financial networks are examples of]{.underline} what the
ecological theorist Timothy Morton calls [hyperobjects.]{.underline}
They are phenomena that actually exist but that "stretch our ideas of
time and space, since they far outlast most human time scales, or
they're massively distributed in terrestrial space and so are
unavailable to immediate experience." Hyperobjects affect everything
that we do, but we cannot point to them in specific instances. [The
chains of causality are far too complicated and intermeshed for us to
follow.]{.underline} In order to make sense of our condition, we are
forced to deal with difficult abstractions. We have to rely upon data
that are gathered in massive quantities by scientific instruments and
then collated through mathematical and statistical formulas but that are
not directly accessible to our senses. We find ourselves, as Mark Hansen
puts it, entangled "within networks of media technologies that operate
predominantly, if not almost entirely, outside the scope of human modes
of awareness (consciousness, attention, sense perception, etc.)." We
cannot imagine such circumstances in any direct or naturalistic way, but
only through the extrapolating lens of science fiction. [Subject to
these conditions, we live under relentless environmental and financial
assault.]{.underline} We continually find ourselves in what might well
be called a state of crisis. However, this involves a paradox. [A
crisis---whether economic, ecological, or political---is a turning
point, a sudden rupture, a sharp and immediate moment of
reckoning.]{.underline} But for us today, [crisis has become a chronic
and seemingly permanent condition. We live, oxymoronically, in a state
of perpetual, but never resolved, convulsion and contradiction. Crises
never come to a culmination; instead, they are endlessly and
indefinitely deferred.]{.underline} For instance, [after the economic
collapse of 2008, the big banks were bailed out by the United States
government. This allowed them to resume the very
practices]{.underline}---the creation of arcane financial instruments,
in order to enable relentless rent-seeking---**[that led to the
breakdown of the economic system in the first place.]{.underline}** [The
functioning of the system is restored, but only in such a way as to
guarantee the renewal of the same crisis, on a greater scale, further
down the road.]{.underline} Marx rightly noted that crises are endemic
to capitalism. But far from threatening the system as Marx hoped, today
[these crises actually help it to renew itself.]{.underline} As David
Harvey puts it, [it is precisely "through the destruction of the
achievements of preceding eras by way of war, the devaluation of assets,
the degradation of productive capacity, abandonment and other forms of
'creative destruction'" that capitalism creates "a new basis for
profit-making and surplus absorption."]{.underline} What lurks behind
this analysis is the frustrating sense of an impasse. Among its other
accomplishments, [neoliberal capitalism has also robbed us of the
future. For it turns everything into an eternal present.]{.underline}
The highest values of our society---as preached in the business
schools---are novelty, innovation, and creativity. And yet these always
only result in more of the same. How often have we been told that a
minor software update "changes everything"? [Our society seems to
function]{.underline}, as Ernst Bloch once put it, [in a state of "sheer
aimless infinity and incessant changeability; where everything ought to
be constantly new, everything remains just as it was." This is because,
in our current state of affairs, the future exists only in order to be
colonized and made into an investment opportunity.]{.underline} John
Maynard Keynes sought to distinguish between risk and genuine
uncertainty. Risk is calculable in terms of probability, but genuine
uncertainty is not. Uncertain events are irreducible to probabilistic
analysis, because "there is no scientific basis on which to form any
calculable probability whatever." Keynes's discussion of uncertainty has
strong affinities with Quentin Meillassoux's account of hyperchaos. For
Meillassoux, there is no "totality of cases," no closed set of all
possible states of the universe. Therefore, there is no way to assign
fixed probabilities to these states. This is not just an empirical
matter of insufficient information; uncertainty exists in principle. For
Meillassoux and Keynes alike, there comes a point where "we simply do
not know." But today, Keynes's distinction is entirely ignored. [The
Black-Scholes Formula and the Efficient Market Hypothesis both conceive
the future entirely in probabilistic terms.]{.underline} In these
theories, as in the actual financial trading that is guided by them (or
at least rationalized by them), [the genuine unknowability of the future
is transformed into a matter of calculable, manageable
risk.]{.underline} True novelty is excluded, because all possible
outcomes have already been calculated and paid for in terms of the
present. While this belief in the calculability of the future is
delusional, it nonetheless determines the way that financial markets
actually work. We might therefore say that speculative finance is the
inverse---and the complement---of the "affirmative speculation" that
takes place in science fiction. Financial speculation seeks to capture,
and shut down, the very same extreme potentialities that science fiction
explores. Science fiction is the narration of open, unaccountable
futures; derivatives trading claims to have accounted for, and
discounted, all these futures already. [The
"market"---]{.underline}nearly deified in neoliberal doctrine---thus
works preemptively, as a global practice of what Richard Grusin calls
premediation. It [seeks to deplete the future in advance. Its relentless
functioning makes it nearly impossible for us to conceive of any
alternative to the global capitalist world order. Such is the condition
that Mark Fisher calls capitalist realism.]{.underline} As Fisher puts
it, channeling both Jameson and Žižek, ["it's easier to imagine the end
of the world than the end of capitalism."]{.underline}

## Impacts \-\-- Militarism

### Algometric Warfare / AI

#### Militarism invests in a need for new technologies like deadly AI that removes ethics from any form of war

\[Ben **Tarnoff 18**\] (Weaponised AI is coming. Are algorithmic forever
wars our future?,Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/11/war-jedi-algorithmic-warfare-us-military
) 10-11-2018 //pyrex ultra

Last month marked the 17th anniversary of 9/11. With it came a new
milestone: [we've been in Afghanistan for so long that someone born
after the attacks is now old enough to go fight there. They can also
serve in the six other places where we're officially at war, not to
mention the 133 countries where special operations forces have conducted
missions in just the first half of 2018. The wars of 9/11 continue, with
no end in sight.]{.underline} Now, [the Pentagon is investing heavily in
**technologies** that will intensify them. By embracing the latest tools
that the tech industry has to offer, the US military is creating a more
automated form of warfare -- one that will greatly increase its capacity
to wage war **everywhere** forever.]{.underline} On Friday, the defense
department closes the bidding period for one of the biggest technology
contracts in its history: the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure
(Jedi). [**Jedi** is an ambitious project to build **a cloud computing
system** that serves US forces all over the world, from analysts behind
a desk in Virginia to soldiers on patrol in Niger.]{.underline} The
contract is worth as much as \$10bn over 10 years, which is why big tech
companies are fighting hard to win it. (Not Google, however, where a
pressure campaign by workers forced management to drop out of the
running.) At first glance, Jedi might look like just another IT
modernization project. Government IT tends to run a fair distance behind
Silicon Valley, even in a place as lavishly funded as the Pentagon. With
some 3.4 million users and 4 million devices, the defense department's
digital footprint is immense. [Moving even a portion of its workloads to
a cloud provider such as Amazon will no doubt improve efficiency. But
the real force driving Jedi is the desire to weaponize **AI** -- what
the defense department has begun calling "**algorithmic
warfare**".]{.underline} [By pooling the military's data into a modern
cloud platform, and using the machine-learning services that such
platforms provide to analyze that data, Jedi will help the Pentagon
realize its AI ambitions.]{.underline} The scale of those ambitions has
grown increasingly clear in recent months. In June, the Pentagon
established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which will
oversee the roughly 600 AI projects currently under way across the
department at a planned cost of \$1.7bn. And in September, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the Pentagon's storied R&D
wing, announced it would be investing up to \$2bn over the next five
years into AI weapons research. So far, the reporting on the Pentagon's
AI spending spree has largely focused on the prospect of autonomous
weapons -- [Terminator-style killer robots that mow people down without
any input from a human operator. This is indeed a frightening
near-future scenario, and a global ban on autonomous weaponry of the
kind sought by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is absolutely
essential. But AI has already begun rewiring warfare, even if it hasn't
(yet) taken the form of literal Terminators. There are less cinematic
but equally scary ways to weaponize AI. You don't need **algorithms**
pulling the trigger **for algorithms to play** an extremely **dangerous
role.** To understand that role, it helps to understand the particular
difficulties posed by the forever war. The killing itself isn't
particularly difficult. With a military budget larger than that of
China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, France, Britain and Japan combined,
and some 800 bases around the world, the US has an abundance of
firepower and an unparalleled ability to deploy that firepower
**anywhere** on the planet. The US military knows how to kill. The
harder part is figuring out whom to kill. In a more traditional war, you
simply kill the enemy. But who is the enemy in a conflict with no
national boundaries, no fixed battlefields, and no conventional
adversaries? This is the perennial question of the forever war. It is
also a key feature of its design. The vagueness of the enemy is what has
enabled the conflict to continue for nearly two decades and to expand to
more than 70 countries -- a boon to the contractors, bureaucrats and
politicians who make their living from US **militarism**. If war is a
racket, in the words of marine legend Smedley Butler, the forever war is
one the longest cons yet. But the vagueness of the enemy also creates
certain challenges. It's one thing to look at a map of North Vietnam and
pick places to bomb. It's quite another to sift through vast quantities
of information from all over the world in order to identify a good
candidate for a drone strike. When the enemy is everywhere, target
identification becomes far more labor-intensive. This is where AI -- or,
more precisely, machine learning -- comes in. Machine learning can help
automate one of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of the
forever war: finding people to kill.]{.underline} The Pentagon's Project
Maven is already putting this idea into practice. Maven, also known as
the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, made headlines recently
for sparking an employee revolt at Google over the company's
involvement. Maven is the military's "pathfinder" AI project. Its
initial phase involves using machine learning to scan drone video
footage to help identify individuals, vehicles and buildings that might
be worth bombing. "We have analysts looking at full-motion video,
staring at screens 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 hours at a time," says the project
director, Lt Gen Jack Shanahan. Maven's software automates that work,
then relays its discoveries to a human. So far, it's been a big success:
the software has been deployed to as many as six combat locations in the
Middle East and Africa. [The goal is to eventually load the software on
to the drones themselves, so they can locate targets in real time. Won't
this technology improve precision, thus reducing civilian casualties?
This is a common argument made by higher-ups in both the Pentagon and
Silicon Valley to defend their collaboration on projects like Maven.
Code for America's Jen Pahlka puts it in terms of "sharp knives" versus
"dull knives": sharper knives can help the military save lives. In the
case of weaponized AI, however, the knives in question aren't
particularly sharp. There is no shortage of horror stories of what
happens when human oversight is outsourced to faulty or prejudiced
algorithms -- algorithms that can't recognize black faces, or that
reinforce racial bias in policing and criminal sentencing.]{.underline}
Do we really want the Pentagon using the same technology to help
determine who gets a bomb dropped on their head? But the deeper problem
with the humanitarian argument for algorithmic warfare is the assumption
that the US military is an essentially benevolent force. Many millions
of people around the world would disagree. In 2017 alone, the US and
allied strikes in Iraq and Syria killed as many as 6,000 civilians.
Numbers like these don't suggest a few honest mistakes here and there,
but a systemic indifference to "collateral damage". Indeed, the US
government has repeatedly bombed civilian gatherings such as weddings in
the hopes of killing a high-value target. Further, the line between
civilian and combatant is highly porous in the era of the forever war. A
report from the Intercept suggests that the US military labels anyone it
kills in "targeted" strikes as "enemy killed in action", even if they
weren't one of the targets. The so-called "signature strikes" conducted
by the US military and the CIA play similar tricks with the concept of
the combatant. [These are drone attacks on individuals whose identities
are unknown, but who are suspected of being militants based on
displaying certain "signatures" -- which can be as vague as being a
military-aged male in a particular area. The problem isn't the quality
of the tools, in other words, but the **institution** wielding them. And
AI will only make that institution more brutal. The forever war demands
that the US sees enemies everywhere. AI promises to find those enemies
faster -- even if all it takes to be considered an enemy is exhibiting a
pattern of behavior that a (classified) machine-learning model
associates with hostile activity. Call it death by big data. AI also has
the potential to make the forever war more permanent, by giving some of
the country's largest companies a stake in perpetuating it. Silicon
Valley has always had close links to the US military. But algorithmic
warfare will bring big tech deeper into the military-industrial complex,
and give billionaires like Jeff Bezos a powerful incentive to ensure the
forever war lasts forever. Enemies will be found. Money will be
made.]{.underline}

2\. The dangers of unfriendly powerful artificial general intelligence
Unlike with whatever wetware runs the human brain, it would be
relatively easy to make changes to a PAGI's software. **[PAGI
could]{.underline}** even **[make changes to itself]{.underline}**.
**[Such selfmodification could possibly allow PAGI to undergo an
intelligence explosion]{.underline}** **[where it figures out how to
improve its own intelligence]{.underline}**, **[then, as it gets
smarter, it figures out new ways to improve its
intelligence]{.underline}**. **[It has been theorized that through
recursive self-improvement]{.underline}** **[a PAGI could go from being
a bit smarter than humans to becoming a computer superintelligence in a
matter of days]{.underline}** (Good, 1965; Yudkowsky, 2008). **[If our
understanding of the laws of physics is correct, the universe contains a
limited amount of free energy]{.underline}**, **[and this free energy is
necessary to do any kind of work and most types of computing.
Consequently, it has been theorized that most types of computer
superintelligences would have an instrumental goal of gathering as much
free energy as possible]{.underline}** to further whatever ultimate
goals they had (Omohundro, 2008). **[Humanity's continued existence uses
free energy.]{.underline}** **[Consequently, if a PAGI did not have
promoting human welfare as a goal, it would likely see humanity's
continuing existence]{.underline}** **[as rival to its terminal
values]{.underline}**. **[A PAGI that wanted to maximize its
understanding of, say, chess would further this end by exterminating
mankind]{.underline}** **[and using the atoms in our bodies to make
chess computing hardware]{.underline}**. **[A PAGI that wanted to
maximize the number of paperclips in the universe would likewise kill
us, not out of malice]{.underline}**, **[but to align the atoms in our
bodies with its objective]{.underline}**. The term "paperclip maximizer"
has come to mean a **[PAGI that seeks to use all the resources it can
get for an objective that most humans would not consider
worthwhile]{.underline}** (Arbital Contributors, 2017). **[A PAGI that
was smarter than humans, but not yet smart enough to take over the
world, would have an incentive to hide its abilities]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[intentions]{.underline}** **[from us if it
predicted that we would turn the PAGI off if it scared us. Consequently,
the PAGI might appear friendly weak]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[unambitious]{.underline}**
**[right]{.underline}** **[until it launches a surprise devastating
attack on us, by taking what has been called a "treacherous
turn"]{.underline}** (Bostrom, 2014, pp. 116-119).

Oren **[Etzioni]{.underline}**, a well-known AI researcher, **[complains
about]{.underline}** **[news coverage]{.underline}** of potential
long-term risks arising from future success in AI research (see "No,
Experts Don\'t Think Superintelligent AI is a Threat to Humanity").
**[After pointing the finger]{.underline}** squarely
**[at]{.underline}** Oxford philosopher Nick **[Bostrom]{.underline}**
and his recent book, Superintelligence, **[Etzioni complains that
Bostrom's "main source of data]{.underline}** on the advent of
human-level intelligence" **[consists of]{.underline}**
**[surveys]{.underline}** on the opinions of AI researchers. **[He then
surveys the opinions of AI researchers, arguing that his results refute
Bostrom's]{.underline}**. It's important to understand that **[Etzioni
is]{.underline}** **[not even addressing the reason
Superintelligence]{.underline}** has **[had the impact he
decries]{.underline}**: its clear explanation of why superintelligent AI
may have arbitrarily negative consequences and why it's important to
begin addressing the issue well in advance. **[Bostrom does not base his
case on predictions that superhuman AI systems are]{.underline}**
**[imminent]{.underline}**. He writes, "It is no part of the argument in
this book that we are on the threshold of a big breakthrough in
artificial intelligence, or that we can predict with any precision when
such a development might occur." **[Thus]{.underline}**, in our view,
**[Etzioni's article]{.underline}** **[distracts]{.underline}** the
reader **[from the]{.underline}** **[core argument]{.underline}** **[of
the book and directs an]{.underline}** **[ad hom]{.underline}**inem
**[attack]{.underline}** **[against Bostrom under the]{.underline}**
**[pretext]{.underline}** **[of disputing his survey
results]{.underline}**. We feel it is necessary to correct the record.
**[One of us (Russell) even]{.underline}** **[contributed to Etzioni's
survey, only to see his response being]{.underline}** **[completely
misconstrued]{.underline}**. In fact, as our detailed analysis shows,
Etzioni's survey results are entirely consistent with the ones Bostrom
cites. **[How, then, does Etzioni reach his novel conclusion? By
designing a survey instrument that is inferior to Bostrom's and then
misinterpreting the results.]{.underline}** The subtitle of the article
reads, "If you ask the people who should really know, you'll find that
few believe AI is a threat to humanity." So **[the reader is led to
believe that Etzioni asked this question of the people who should really
know, while Bostrom did not. In fact, the]{.underline}**
**[opposite]{.underline}** **[is true: Bostrom did ask people who should
really know, but Etzioni did not ask anyone at all. Bostrom surveyed the
top 100 most cited AI researchers. More than half]{.underline}** of the
respondents **[said they believe there is a]{.underline}**
**[substantial]{.underline}** (at least 15 percent) **[chance that the
effect of human-level machine intelligence on humanity will be "on
balance bad" or "extremely bad]{.underline}**
(**[existential]{.underline}** **[catastrophe]{.underline}**)."
**[Etzioni's survey]{.underline}**, unlike Bostrom's, **[did not
ask]{.underline}** **[any]{.underline}** **[questions about a threat to
humanity]{.underline}**. **[Instead, he simply asks]{.underline}**
**[one]{.underline}** **[question about]{.underline}**
**[when]{.underline}** **[we will achieve
superintelligence.]{.underline}** **[As Bostrom's data would have
already predicted, somewhat more than half]{.underline}** (67.5 percent)
of Etzioni's respondents **[plumped for "more than 25
years"]{.underline}** to achieve superintelligence---after all, more
than half of Bostrom's respondents gave dates beyond 25 years for a mere
50 percent probability of achieving mere human-level intelligence. One
of us (Russell) responded to Etzioni's survey with "more than 25 years,"
and Bostrom himself writes, of his own surveys, "My own view is that the
median numbers reported in the expert survey do not have enough
probability mass on later arrival dates." Now, having designed a survey
where respondents could be expected to choose "more than 25 years,"
**[Etzioni]{.underline}** springs his trap: he **[asserts]{.underline}**
**[that 25 years is]{.underline}** **["beyond the foreseeable
horizon"]{.underline}** **[and thereby deduces that neither Russell nor
indeed Bostrom himself believes that superintelligent AI is a threat to
humanity. This will come as a surprise to Russell and Bostrom, and
presumably to many other respondents]{.underline}** **[in the
survey]{.underline}**. (Indeed, **[Etzioni's headline could just as
easily have been "75 percent of experts think superintelligent AI is
inevitable."]{.underline}**) **[Should we ignore catastrophic risks
simply because most experts think they are]{.underline}** **[more than
25 years away?]{.underline}** **[By Etzioni's logic, we should also
ignore]{.underline}** the catastrophic risks of **[climate
change]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[castigate]{.underline}**
**[those who bring them up]{.underline}**. Contrary to the views of
Etzioni and some others in the AI community, **[pointing to long-term
risks from AI is not equivalent to claiming that superintelligent AI and
its accompanying risks are "imminent."]{.underline}** The list of those
who have pointed to the risks includes such luminaries as Alan Turing,
Norbert Wiener, I.J. Good, and Marvin Minsky. Even Oren Etzioni has
acknowledged these challenges. To our knowledge, none of these ever
asserted that superintelligent AI was imminent. Nor, as noted above, did
Bostrom in Superintelligence.

### AI Arms Race -\> X

**[Artificial intelligence in its current form is]{.underline}** mostly
**[harmless]{.underline}**, **[but that's not going to
last]{.underline}**. **[Machines are getting smarter]{.underline}** and
more capable by the minute, leading to concerns that **[AI will
eventually match]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** then
**[exceed]{.underline}**, **[human]{.underline}** levels of
**[intelligence]{.underline}**---**[a prospect known as artificial
superintelligence]{.underline}** (**[ASI]{.underline}**). As a
technological prospect, ASI will be unlike anything we've ever
encountered before. We have no prior experience to guide us, which means
we're going to have to put our collective heads together and start
preparing. **[It's not hyperbole to say humanity's existence is at
stake]{.underline}**---as hard as that is to hear and admit---**[and
given there's no consensus on when we can expect to meet our new digital
overlords, it would be incumbent upon us to start preparing now for this
possibility, and not wait until some arbitrary date in the
future.]{.underline}** On the horizon Indeed, **[the return of an AI
winter, a period in which innovations in AI slow down appreciably, no
longer seems likely.]{.underline}** **[Fueled primarily by the powers of
machine learning, we've entered into a golden era of AI research, and
with no apparent end in sight.]{.underline}** In recent years we've
witnessed startling progress in areas such as independent learning,
foresight, autonomous navigation, computer vision, and video gameplay.
Computers can now trade stocks on the order of milliseconds, automated
cars are increasingly appearing on our streets, and artificially
intelligent assistants have encroached into our homes. **[The coming
years will bear witness to further advancements, including AI that can
learn through its own experiences, adapt to novel situations, and
comprehend abstractions and analogies. We don't know when ASI will arise
or what form it'll take, but the signs of its impending arrival are
starting to appear.]{.underline}** Last year, for example, in a
bot-on-bot Go tournament, DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero (AGZ), defeated the
regular AlphaGo by a score of 100 games to zero. Incredibly, AGZ
required just three days to train itself from scratch, during which time
it acquired literally thousands of years of human Go playing experience.
As the DeepMind researchers noted, it's now "possible to train
\[machines\] to superhuman level, without human examples or guidance,
given no knowledge of the domain beyond basic rules." It was a stark
reminder that developments in this field are susceptible to rapid,
unpredictable, and dramatic improvements, and that we've entered into a
new era---the age of superintelligent machines. "According to several
estimates, supercomputers can now---or in the near future---do more
elementary operations per second than human brains, so we might already
have the necessary hardware to compete with brains," said Jaan Tallinn,
a computer programmer, founding member of Skype, and co-founder of the
Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, a research center at the
University of Cambridge concerned with human extinction scenarios.
"Also, a lot of research effort is now going into 'meta learning'---that
is, developing AIs that would be able to design AIs. Therefore, progress
in AI might at some point simply decouple from human speeds and
timelines." **[These and other developments will likely lead to the
introduction of AGI]{.underline}**, otherwise known as artificial
general intelligence. **[Unlike]{.underline}** artificial narrow
intelligence (**[ANI]{.underline}**), which is super good at solving
specialized tasks, like playing Go or recognizing human faces, **[AGI
will exhibit proficiency across multiple domains. This powerful form of
AI will be more humanlike in its abilities, adapting to new situations,
learning a wide variety of skills, and performing an extensive variety
of tasks. Once we achieve AGI, the step to superintelligence will be a
short one---especially if AGIs are told to create increasingly better
versions of themselves.]{.underline}** "**[It is difficult to predict
technological advancement, but a few factors indicate that AGI and ASI
might be possible within the next several decades,"]{.underline}** said
Yolanda Lannquist, AI policy researcher at The Future Society, a
non-profit think tank concerned with the impacts of emerging
technologies. She points to companies currently working towards AGI
development, including Google DeepMind, GoodAI, Araya Inc., Vicarious,
SingularityNET, among others, including smaller teams and individuals at
universities. At the same time, Lannquist said research on ANI may lead
to breakthroughs towards AGI, with companies such as Facebook, Google,
IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, OpenAI, Tencent, Baidu, and Xiaomi among
the major companies currently investing heavily in AI research. **[With
AI increasingly entering into our lives, we're starting to see unique
problems emerge, particularly in areas of privacy, security, and
fairness. AI ethics boards are starting to become commonplace, for
example, along with standards projects to ensure safe and ethical
machine intelligence. Looking ahead, we're going to have to deal with
such developments as massive technological unemployment, the rise of
autonomous killing machines (including weaponized drones), AI-enabled
hacking, and other threats.]{.underline}** Beyond human levels of
comprehension and control **[But these are problems of the present and
the near future, and most of us can agree that measures should be taken
to mitigate these negative aspects of AI.]{.underline}** More
controversially, however, is **[the suggestion that we begin preparing
for the advent of artificial superintelligence---that heralded moment
when machines surpass human levels of intelligence by several orders of
magnitude.]{.underline}** What makes ASI particularly dangerous is that
it will operate beyond human levels of control and comprehension.
**[Owing to its tremendous reach, speed, and computational proficiency,
ASI will be capable of accomplishing virtually anything it's programmed
or decides to do.]{.underline}** **[There are many extreme scenarios
that come to mind. Armed with superhuman powers, an ASI could destroy
our civilization, either by accident, misintention, or deliberate
design.]{.underline}** For instance, it could turn our planet into goo
after a simple misunderstanding of its goals (the allegorical paperclip
scenario is a good example), remove humanity as a troublesome nuisance,
or wipe out our civilization and infrastructure as it strives to improve
itself even further, a possibility AI theorists refer to as recursive
self-improvement. **[Should humanity embark upon an AI arms race with
rival nations, a weaponized ASI could get out of control, either during
peacetime or during war. An ASI could intentionally end humanity by
destroying our planet's atmosphere or biosphere with self-replicating
nanotechnology. Or it could launch all our nuclear weapons, spark a
Terminator-style robopocalypse, or unleash some powers of physics we
don't even know about. Using genetics, cybernetics, nanotechnology, or
other means at its disposal, an ASI could reengineer us into blathering,
mindless automatons, thinking it was doing us some sort of favor in an
attempt to pacify our violent natures. Rival ASIs could wage war against
themselves in a battle for resources, scorching the planet in the
process.]{.underline}** Clearly, we have no shortage of ideas, **[but
conjuring ASI-inspired doomsday scenarios is actually quite besides the
point; we already have it within our means to destroy ourselves, and it
won't be difficult for ASI to come up with its own ways to end
us.]{.underline}** The prospect admittedly sounds like science fiction,
but a growing number of prominent thinkers and concerned citizens are
starting to take this possibility very seriously. Tallinn said once ASI
emerges, it'll confront us with entirely new types of problems. "By
definition, **[ASI will understand the world and humans better than we
understand it, and it's not obvious at all how we could control
something like that,]{.underline}**" said Tallinn. "**[If you think
about it, what happens to chimpanzees is no longer up to them, because
we humans control their environment by being more
intelligent.]{.underline}** We should work on AI alignment \[AI that's
friendly to humans and human interests\] to avoid a similar fate." Katja
Grace, editor of the AI Impacts blog and a researcher at the Machine
Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), said ASI will be the first
technology to potentially surpass humans on every dimension. "So far,
humans have had a monopoly on decision-making, and therefore had control
over everything," she told Gizmodo. "With artificial intelligence, this
may end." Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science and an expert
in artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley,
said we should be concerned about the potential for ASI for one simple
reason: intelligence is power. "Evolution and history do not provide
good examples of a less powerful class of entities retaining power
indefinitely over a more powerful class of entities," Russell told
Gizmodo. "We do not yet know how to control ASI, because, traditionally,
control over other entities seems to require the ability to out-think
and out-anticipate---and, by definition, we cannot out-think and
out-anticipate ASI. We have to take an approach to designing AI systems
that somehow sidesteps this basic problem." Be prepared Okay, so we have
our work cut out for ourselves. But we shouldn't despair, or worse, do
nothing---there are things we can do in the here-and-now. Nick Bostrom,
author of Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies and a
philosopher at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, said no specific
protocols or sweeping changes to society are required today, but he
agreed we can do consequential research in this area. "A few years ago
the argument that we should do nothing may have made sense, as we had no
real idea on how we should research this and make meaningful progress,"
Bostrom told Gizmodo. "But concepts and ideas are now in place, and we
can break it down into chunks worthy of research." He said this could
take the form of research papers, think tanks, seminars, and so on.
"People are now doing important research work in this area," said
Bostrom, "It's something we can hammer away at and make incremental
progress." Russell agreed, saying we should think about ways of
developing and designing AI systems that are provably safe and
beneficial, regardless of how intelligent the components become. He
believes this is possible, provided the components are defined, trained,
and connected in the right way. Indeed, this is something we should
doing already. Prior to the advent of AGI and ASI, we'll have to contend
with the threats posed by more basic, narrow AI---the kind that's
already starting to appear in our infrastructure. By solving the
problems posed by current AI, we could learn some valuable lessons and
set some important precedents that could pave the way to building safe,
but even more powerful AI, in the future. Take the prospect of
autonomous vehicles, for example. Once deployed en masse, self-driving
cars will be monitored, and to a certain extent controlled, by a central
intelligence. This overseeing "brain" will send software updates to its
fleet, advise cars on traffic conditions, and serve as the overarching
network's communication hub. But imagine if someone were to hack into
this system and send malicious instructions to the fleet. It would be a
disaster on an epic scale. Such is the threat of AI. "**[Cybersecurity
of AI systems is a major hole]{.underline}**," Lannquist told Gizmodo.
"**[Autonomous systems, such as autonomous vehicles, personal assistant
robots, AI toys, drones, and even weaponized systems are subject to
cyber attacks and hacking, to spy, steal, delete or alter information or
data, halt or disrupt service, and even hijacking," she said.
"Meanwhile, there is a talent shortage in cybersecurity among
governments and companies."]{.underline}** Another major risk, according
to Lannquist, is bias in the data sets used to train machine learning
algorithms. The resulting models aren't fit for everyone, she said,
leading to problems of inclusion, equality, fairness, and even the
potential for physical harm. An autonomous vehicle or surgical robot may
not be sufficiently trained on enough images to discern humans of
different skin color or sizes, for example. Scale this up to the level
of ASI, and the problem becomes exponentially worse. **[Commercial face
recognition software, for example, has repeatedly been shown to be less
accurate on people with darker skin. Meanwhile, a predictive policing
algorithm called PredPol was shown to unfairly target certain
neighborhoods. And in a truly disturbing case, the COMPAS algorithm,
which predicts the likelihood of recidivism to guide sentencing, was
found to be racially biased. This is happening today---imagine the havoc
and harm an ASI could inflict with greater power, scope, and social
reach.]{.underline}** It will also be important for humans to stay
within the comprehension loop, meaning we need to maintain an
understanding of an AI's decision making rationale. This is already
proving to be difficult as AI keeps encroaching into superhuman realms.
This is what's known as the "black box" problem, and it happens when
developers are at a loss to explain the behavior of their creations.
Making something safe when we don't have full understanding of how it
works is a precarious proposition at best. Accordingly, efforts will be
required to create AIs that are capable of explaining themselves in ways
we puny humans can comprehend. Thankfully, that's already happening.
Last year, for example, DARPA gave \$6.5 million to computer scientists
at Oregon State University to address this issue. The four-year grant
will support the development of new methodologies designed to help
researchers make better sense of the digital gobbledygook inside black
boxes, most notably by getting AIs to explain to humans why they reached
certain decisions, or what their conclusions actually mean. We also need
to change the corporate culture around the development of AI,
particularly in Silicon Valley where the prevailing attitude is to "fail
hard and fast or die slow." This sort of mentality won't work for strong
AI, which will require extreme caution, consideration, and foresight.
Cutting corners and releasing poorly thought out systems could end in
disaster. "Through more collaboration, such as AGI researchers pooling
their resources to form a consortia, industry-led guidelines and
standards, or technical standards and norms, we can hopefully
re-engineer this 'race to the bottom' in safety standards, and instead
have a 'race to the top,'" said Lannquist. "In a 'race to the top,'
companies take time to uphold ethical and safety standards. Meanwhile,
the competition is beneficial because it can speed up progress towards
beneficial innovation, like AI for UN Sustainable Development Goals." At
the same time, corporations should consider information sharing,
particularly if a research lab has stumbled upon a particularly nasty
vulnerability, like an algorithm that can sneak past encryption schemes,
spread to domains outside an intended realm, or be easily weaponized.
Changing corporate culture won't be easy, but it needs to start at the
top. To facilitate this, companies should create a new executive
position, a Chief Safety Officer (CSO), or something similar, to oversee
the development of what could be catastrophically dangerous AI, among
other dangerous emerging technologies. Governments and other public
institutions have a role to play as well. Russell said we need
well-informed groups, committees, agencies, and other institutions
within governments that have access to top-level AI researchers. We also
need to develop standards for safe AI system design, he added.
"Governments can incentivize research for AI safety, through grants,
awards, and grand challenges," added Lannquist. "The private sector or
academia can contribute or collaborate on research with AI safety
organizations. AI researchers can organize to uphold ethical and safe AI
development procedures, and research organizations can set up processes
for whistle-blowing." Action is also required at the international
level. **[The existential dangers posed by AI are potentially more
severe than climate change]{.underline}**, yet we still have no
equivalent to the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). How
about an International Panel for Artificial Intelligence? In addition to
establishing and enforcing standards and regulations, this panel could
serve as a "safe space" for AI developers who believe they're working on
something particularly dangerous. A good rule of thumb would be to stop
development, and seek council with this panel. On a similar note, and as
some previous developments in biotechnology have shown, some research
findings are too dangerous to share with the general public (e.g.
"gain-of-function" studies in which viruses are deliberately mutated to
infect humans). An international AI panel could decide which
technological breakthroughs should stay secret for reasons of
international security. Conversely, as per the rationale of the
gain-of-function studies, the open sharing of knowledge could result in
the development of proactive safety measures. Given the existential
nature of ASI, however, it's tough to imagine the ingredients of our
doom being passed around for all to see. This will be a tricky area to
navigate. On a more general level, we need to get more people working on
the problem, including mathematicians, logicians, ethicists, economists,
social scientists, and philosophers. A number of groups have already
started to address the ASI problem, including Oxford's Future of
Humanity Institute, MIRI, the UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible
AI, OpenAI, and Google Brain. Other initiatives include the Asilomar
Conference, which has already established guidelines for the safe
development of AI, and the Open Letter on AI signed by many prominent
thinkers, including the late physicist Stephen Hawking, Tesla and SpaceX
founder Elon Musk, and others. Russell said the general public can
contribute as well---but they need to educate themselves about the
issues. "Learn about some of the new ideas and read some of the
technical papers, not just media articles about Musk---Zuckerberg
smackdowns," he said. "Think about how those ideas apply to your work.
For example, if you work on visual classification, what objective is the
algorithm optimizing? What is the loss matrix? Are you sure that
misclassifying a cat as a dog has the same cost as misclassifying a
human as a gorilla? If not, think about how to do classification
learning with an uncertain loss matrix." Ultimately, Russell said it's
important to avoid a tribalist mindset. "Don't imagine that a discussion
of risk is 'anti-AI.' It's not. It's a complement to AI. It's saying,
'AI has the potential to impact the world,'" he said. "Just as biology
has grown up and physics has grown up and accepted some responsibility
for its impact on the world, it's time for AI to grow up---unless, that
is, you really believe that AI will never have any impact and will never
work." The ASI problem is poised to be the most daunting challenge our
species has ever faced, and we very well may fail. But we have to try.

### AI Arms Race \-\-- UNQ

**Military Technology Build up is happening now \-\-- the alt is key to
disarm**

\[Kristin **[Huang 19\]]{.underline}** (US-China race to build killer
robots 'a threat to humanity',South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3009540/us-china-ai-race-develop-killer-robots-risks-catastrophe-warn
) 5-9-2019 //pyrex ultra

**[An artificial intelligence arms race]{.underline}** between majors
powers such as China, Russia and the US **[could lead to catastrophe for
humanity,]{.underline}** according to a peace campaign organisation. The
report, by the Dutch-based organisation Pax, called for a pre-emptive
ban on so-called killer robots and warned that **[the development of the
technology could leave algorithms deciding whether people would live or
die. "An AI arms race ... is more likely to be a no-win situation ...
\[it\] would be destabilising and increase the chances of conflict. It
would have negative economic, political and societal
impacts,"]{.underline}** said the report, after examining the AI push in
seven nations including United States, China and Russia. It said **[the
development of lethal autonomous weapons -- designed to shorten reaction
times and make strikes more precise -- was curtailing the
decision-making process regarding the use of force and increased the
risk of mass casualties. The world's leading military powers have
heavily invested in AI and are seeking to develop autonomous weapons
like drones or submarines, which can detect a target enemy and
automatically attack.]{.underline}** **[The US]{.underline}** is making
AI a priority and **[set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence
Centre]{.underline}** last year to oversee the development of the
technology by its service branches and defence agencies. Meanwhile
**[China has set up two major research organisations focused on AI and
unmanned systems in its race to keep up with the US. Articles by PLA
personnel suggest Beijing is researching an "algorithm game" which will
help predict what happens on the battlefield. Russia is also
prioritising AI, the report said, and its road map for developing the
technology is expected to be released within a matter of
months.]{.underline}** Daan Kayser, the project leader on autonomous
weapons at Pax, urged the international community to work on a clear
international rule that regulates the use of lethal autonomous weapons.
"**[We are looking at a near-future where AI-enabled weapons take over
human roles, selecting and attacking targets on their own. "Without
clear international rules, we may enter an era where algorithms, not
people, decide over life and death]{.underline}**," said Kayser. Frank
Slijper, a co-author of the report, called for international cooperation
and transparency. "Transparency will bring security and help prevent
this arms race from proceeding," Slijper said. Currently, the US is one
of the few countries to have a specific policy on lethal autonomous
weapon systems designed to reduce the risk that killer robots will
attack the wrong targets. In 2012, the Pentagon ordered that
"semi-autonomous weapon systems that are on-board or integrated with
unmanned platforms must be designed such that, in the event of degraded
or lost communications, the system does not autonomously select and
engage individual targets or specific target groups that have not been
previously selected by an authorised human operator".

As we approach the International Day of Nonviolence on October 2, which
recognizes Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, one challenge we face is to
celebrate his life in a way that **[Gandhi]{.underline}** himself would
have found meaningful. Gandhi was not a man of token gestures. **[His
life was dedicated to his search for the Truth and guided by his
passionate belief that nonviolence was the means to reach it.
He]{.underline}** was a visionary who **[was profoundly aware of the
damage human violence is doing to ourselves, each other and the
Earth.]{.underline}** Despite his example, **[most of us are familiar
with those horror lists that reveal the extent of our ongoing
violence]{.underline}**. Here is a sample just to refresh your memory.
**[Human beings spend \$2,000,000,000 \[two trillion\] each day on
military violence, the sole purpose of which is to terrorize and kill
fellow human beings. And we are poised on the brink of dramatically
expanding the war against Syria with]{.underline}** unknown (and
**[possibly nuclear]{.underline}**) **[consequences]{.underline}** for
us all. **[Because we spend so many resources on military violence, one
human being]{.underline}** in Africa, Asia, or Central/South America
**[is starved to death every two or three seconds --- that is 35,000
people each day --- and poverty and homelessness continue their
relentless expansion in industrialized countries]{.underline}**. In
addition to this problem, "**[water starvation" is becoming a frequent
reality for many people and the collapse of hydrological systems is now
expected by 2020. Human activity drives 200 species of
life]{.underline}** (birds, animals, fish, insects) **[to extinction
each day and 80% of the world's forests and over 90% of the large fish
in the ocean are already gone]{.underline}**. **[As polluters, humans
are supreme: Eighty-one tons of mercury]{.underline}** --- the most
toxic heavy metal in existence --- **[is emitted into the atmosphere
each year as a result of electric power generation]{.underline}**; there
are 46,000 pieces of floating plastic in every square mile of ocean; and
**[each year we dump billions of kilograms of pesticides into the
environment]{.underline}**, which pollutes the groundwater and seriously
damages human health. Moreover, **[as everyone knows, we pump vast
quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere]{.underline}** and
release radioactive contaminants into the environment too. How serious
is this? **[According to]{.underline}** James **[Hansen and colleagues,
ongoing burning of fossil fuels at the current rate will cause
catastrophic levels of global]{.underline} [warming and burning all
fossil fuels 'would make most of the planet uninhabitable by
humans']{.underline}**. (See "Climate sensitivity, sea level and
atmospheric carbon dioxide".) And, according to Layne Hartsell and
Emanuel Pastreich, commenting on just one aspect of the radioactive
contamination problem, "**[Radiation continues to leak
from]{.underline}** the crippled **[Fukushima]{.underline}** Daiichi
site **[into groundwater, threatening to contaminate the entire Pacific
Ocean."]{.underline}** (See "Peer-to-Peer Science: The Century-Long
Challenge to Respond to Fukushima.") **[Can humanity survive? The odds
are]{.underline}** now **[stacked heavily against us]{.underline}**:
despite the persistent warnings of visionaries, such as Gandhi, and
scientists since the 1940s, **[we have breached far too many limits that
it would have been wise to respect]{.underline}**. And **[the forces
still arrayed against us, particularly those corporations that profit
from this violence as well as their political puppets, are not going to
give way without a struggle]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[they can use
education systems]{.underline}** and the corporate media **[to try to
manipulate us into believing what they want, whether it is their denials
of reality or that our resistance cannot work]{.underline}**. In
addition, they have the police, legal, and prison systems to inflict
more violence upon us when we do find the courage to resist.
**[But]{.underline}** there is good news too. The good news is that
**[there are a lot of great people]{.underline}**. And by "great people"
I mean **[ordinary people]{.underline}** like you and me **[who are
willing to listen to the truth and then do something tangible to make a
difference]{.underline}**, sometimes by taking no risk at all and
sometimes by taking a small, shared risk. So what can we do?

\[Simon **Springer 2011**\] (Violence sits in places? Cultural practice,
neoliberal rationalism, and virulent imaginative geographies" Political
Geography 30, 90-98, Department of Geography, University of Otago, New
Zealand) xx-xx-2011 //pyrex ultra

The idea that violence might be integral to cultural practice is¶
difficult to accept. In concert with the abuse that the concept of¶
culture has been subjected to as of late, [where in keeping with
geopolitical hegemony]{.underline} (see Harrison & Huntington, 2000),
or¶ perhaps more surprisingly in an attempt to argue against such¶
hegemonic might (see Roberts, 2001), some cultures, particularly¶
[['Asian']{.mark}, 'African', or 'Islamic' cultures, [are conferred with
a supposedly¶ inherent predilection towards
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet the relationship between culture and
violence is also axiomatic, since violence is part of human activity.
Thus, it is not the call for violence to be understood as a social
process informed by culture that is problematic; rather it is [[the
potential to colonize this observation with imaginative
geographies]{.mark} that distort it in such a fashion that deliberately
or inadvertently enable particular geostrategic aims to gain
validity]{.underline}. The principal method of distortion is
Orientalism,¶ which as 'a distribution of geopolitical awareness into
aesthetic,¶ scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and
philological texts',¶ is 'an elaboration not only of a basic
geographical distinction' but¶ a whole series of 'interests' which
create, maintain, and have the¶ intention to understand, control,
manipulate, and incorporate that¶ which is manifestly different through
a discourse that is produced¶ and exists in an uneven exchange with
various kinds of power:¶ political, intellectual, cultural, and moral
(Said, 2003: 12). At base,¶ [Orientalism is a form of paranoia that
feeds on cartographies of fear by producing 'our' world negatively
through the construction of a perverse 'Other'.]{.underline} This is
precisely the discourse colonialism mobilized to construct its
exploitative authority in the past. In the¶ current context, a
relatively new geostrategic aim appeals to the same discursive
principles for valorization in its quest to impose an econometric
version of global sovereignty (Hart, 2006; Pieterse,¶ 2004; Sparke,
2004). Neoliberalism is on the move, and in the¶ context of the global
south[, [Orientalism is its latitude inasmuch as it affords
neoliberalism a powerful discursive space to
manuver]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ This paper has two interrelated central
aims. First, building on¶ the work of Arturo Escobar (2001) and Doreen
Massey (2005), I¶ contribute to re-theorizations of place as a
relational assemblage,¶ rather than as an isolated container, by calling
into question the¶ relationship between place and violence. Second,
informed by an understanding of Orientalism as performative (Said,
2003), and power/knowledge as productive (Foucault, 1977), I set out to¶
challenge how [[neoliberalism d]{.mark}iscursively [assigns
violence]{.mark} to particular peoples and cultures]{.underline} through
its employment of the problematic notions of place that I dispute. I
argue that Orientalism [maintains an underlying assumption that violence
sits in places,¶ and as an affect and effect of discourse,]{.underline}
this Orientalist view is¶ enabled because the production of space and
place is largely¶ a discursive enterprise (Bachelard, 1964; Lefebvre,
1991). But while violence can bind itself to our somatic geographies and
lived experiences of place, in the same way that culture is not confined
to¶ any particular place, so too do violent geographies stretch inwards
and outwards to reveal the inherent dynamism of space as multiple sites
are repeatedly entwined by violence. Thus, following Michel¶ Foucault's
(1977, 1980) insights on power, I am not interested in the why of
violence, but rather the how and where of violence. A culturally
sensitive critical political economy approach alerts us¶ to the
power/knowledge-geometries at play (Hart, 2002; Peet,¶ 2000; Sayer,
2001), so that while [violence is clearly mediated¶ through and informed
by local cultural norms, it is equally¶ enmeshed in the logic of
globalized capital]{.underline}.¶ In the setting of the global south,
where and upon which the global north's caricatural vision of violence
repeatedly turns, [authoritarian leaders may appropriate neoliberal
concerns for market security as a rationale for their violent and
repressive actions]{.underline} (Canterbury, 2005; Springer, 2009c). At
the same time,¶ [because of the performative nature of
Orientalism,]{.underline} an exasperated [populace may follow their
'scripted' roles and resort to violent means in their attempts to cope
with the festering poverty and mounting inequality wrought by their
state's deepening neoliberalization]{.underline}¶ (Uvin, 2003). Far from
being a symptom of an innate¶ cultural proclivity for violence,
state-sponsored violence and systemic social strife can be seen as
outcomes of both a state made 'differently powerful' via the ongoing
'roll-out' of neoliberal reforms (Peck, 2001: 447), and the discourses
that support this¶ process (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 2001; Springer, 2010b).
Thus, when applied to the context of 'the Other', neoliberalism
maintains¶ e in the double sense of both incessant reproduction and the
construction of alterity as 'Self'-perpetuating logic. Through the
circulation of a discourse that posits violence as an exclusive¶
cultural preserve, and by inextricably linking itself to democracy[,
neoliberalism presents itself as the harbinger of rationality and the
only guarantor of peace. Yet [neoliberalism's structural effects of
poverty and inequality often (re)produce violence]{.mark} (Escobar,¶
2004; Springer, 2008), and as such, [neoliberalism perpetually renews
its own license by suggesting it will cure that which neoliberalization
ails]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ To be clear from the outset, this paper is
decidedly theoretical.¶ While writing about violence directly in
empirical terms is¶ a worthwhile endeavor to be sure, it is one that e
without significant¶ attention and attachment to social theory e risks
lending itself to problematic and even Orientalist readings of place.
Thus,¶ the purpose here is to critique the limitations of a
placed-based¶ approach to violence that merely catalogs in situ, rather
than appropriately recognizing the relational geographies of both
violence and place. Accordingly, I do not offer empirical accounts of
particular places, as my intention is to call such particularized
interpretations of 'place' into question. The punctuation in the title¶
is very much purposeful in this regard. While violence sits in places in
terms of the way in which we perceive its manifestation as a localized
and embodied experience, [this very idea is challenged when place is
reconsidered as a relational assemblage. This re-theorization opens up
the supposed fixity, separation, and immutability of place to recognize
it instead as always co-constituted by]{.underline}, mediated through,
and integrated within the wider [experiences of space. Such a radical
rethinking of place fundamentally transforms the way we understand
violence]{.underline}. No longer confined to its material expression as
an isolated 'event' or localized 'thing', violence can more
appropriately be understood [as an unfolding process, arising from the
broader geographical phenomena]{.underline} and temporal patterns of the
social world. In short,¶ through such a reinterpretation of place,
geographers are much better positioned to dismiss Orientalist accounts
that bind violence to particular peoples, cultures, and places, as was
the mandate of colonial geography. [We can instead initiate a more
emancipatory geography that challenges such colonial imaginings by
questioning how seemingly local expressions of violence are instead
always imbricated within wider socio-spatial and political economic
patterns. This allows geographers to recognize with more theoretical
force how ongoing (neo)colonial frameworks, like neoliberalism, are
woven between, within, and across places in ways that facilitate and
(re)produce violence.]{.underline}

### War

**The logics of militarism necessitates capitalist logics that leads to
endless war**

\[Edgar **[Illas 15]{.underline}**\](assistant Professor of Catalan and
Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and capitalist
theorist @ Indiana University, Bloomington, "Survival, or, the War Logic
of Global Capitalism", March 16^th^, 2015,
<http://arcade.stanford.edu/content/survival-or-war-logic-global-capitalism>)
03-16-2015

Perhaps **[the logic of global capitalism is no longer cultural but has
evolved into a logic of war]{.underline}**. As Fredric Jameson and David
Harvey, among many others, taught us, financial capitalism unfolded in
the second half of the twentieth century based on a logic of difference
that produced cultural and spatial identities throughout the globe. In
postmodernity, localities, cities, nations, and **[all types of spaces
and communities began to develop distinctive qualities to attract the
flows of global capital]{.underline}**. Postmodern culture was thus
fully subsumed in the production and marketing of difference. While this
process is still operative today, another aspect seems to play the
dominant role. **[This aspect is the war logic of
globalization]{.underline}**. Globalization appeared in the 1990s as the
consolidation of a single world market, the establishment of post-Cold
War peace, **[the successful union of capitalism and democracy, and the
technological development that would make possible the
interconnectedness of the globe]{.underline}**. **[But]{.underline}** in
the 2000s, and especially **[after 9/11, globalization has shown a
darker side: multiple forms of state and transnational violence have not
proven to be exceptional moments of conflict, but the normal functioning
of the system.]{.underline}** Violence does not interrupt the smooth
course of globalization; on the contrary**[, the global world needs to
be in a constant state of emergency in order to function in an effective
and profitable way.]{.underline}** Many theorists have described the
unprecedented nature of this new state of war. For Michael Hardt and
Antonio Negri, **[globalization has turned war into a "permanent social
relation" and has effaced the traditional distinction between politics
and warfare.]{.underline}** Hardt and Negri emphasize three
characteristics of the global state of war: the unlimited extension of
conflict, both spatially and temporally; **[the intermingling of
domestic and international politics]{.underline}**; and the diffusion of
the Schmittian **[distinction between friend and enemy]{.underline}**. A
certain ambiguity traverses their narrative. On the one hand, **[they
locate the origin of global war in the shift from modern warfare to
biopolitical warfare, that is, in the emergence of twentieth century
biopolitical control of populations and bodies through state
apparatuses]{.underline}**. For Hardt and Negri, the technologization of
death that culminated in Auschwitz and Hiroshima represents the full
capture of social life by biopolitical control and destruction. On the
other hand, however**[, they present a historical difference between
twentieth-century wars and global war when they observe that the latter,
starting with George Bush's 1991 Persian Gulf War, constitutes a
"project to create a 'new world order']{.underline}**." In this respect,
a fundamental difference separates the two historical phases, and the
complete destructiveness of total war has been supplemented by a certain
constructive impulse of global war. **[Global war is constructive to the
extent that it permanently redefines the spaces of globalization and
rearranges the distribution of sovereign power.]{.underline}** Carlo
Galli draws up a different historical typology and divides modern war in
three phases. First, what Clausewitz called "real absolute war"
corresponds to the classic wars between nation-states within the
Westphalian legality of the Jus Publicum Europaeum. In this phase, war
had a distinct rationale, namely the protection of the national body
against other national enemies. Second, what Raymond Aron called the
"total wars" of the twentieth century led to mass destruction in both
social and individual spheres. The rationale of war was no longer
protection but irrational destruction. Galli observes that, despite
their genocidal logic, total wars still produced a main spatial
difference between "friend" and "enemy," which resulted in the
bipolarity of the Cold War. In global war, in contrast, **[we no longer
find a clear difference between the spaces of the friend and the spaces
of the enemy]{.underline}**. For Galli, global war involves no telos and
no division between internal and external spaces. Global war is the
inherent obverse of globalization, in which "every local point
become\[s\] an immediate function of a single global Totality (the
principle of 'glocality')." Globalization is "at every point, an
immediate short-circuit between local and global," which generates a
"contradiction without system" and makes violence a boundless mode of
being. The difference between this situation and total war is that the
latter was based on total mobilization and "the immediate militarization
of society," whereas global war entails "the global socialization of
violence." **[The transformation of violence into a social relation has
destabilized a central paradigm for political and theoretical practices.
Whereas under the cultural logic of late capitalism the recognition of
all types of differences and the unearthing of heterodox, queer,
marginal and subaltern subjectivities were the main driving forces of
critical efforts, in the new conjuncture recognition is no longer the
last horizon of cultural and social politics. Under the war logic of
globalization, another regime has become dominant: the regime of
survival]{.underline}**. Two determinations conflated in the task of
cultural recognition. First, **[the cultural logic of capital
established a market of identities that made possible the recognition of
multiple subject positions that had been previously invisible or
nonexistent]{.underline}**. Second, the destruction of total war in the
twentieth century made imperative that an ethical task of recognition
worked against the disappearances, forgetting, and repression it caused
everywhere. Recognition encompassed, on the one hand, ethical work
against the effects of total war and, on the other, an opening to the
possibilities offered by the new postmodern marketplace. I will now
focus on three important aspects of the regime of survival. These
aspects are the new antagonistic relation between life and death; the
post-katechontic nature of survival; and the overcoming of the modern
paradigms of convivance and biopolitics. The contemporary regime of
survival contends with a new reality of life and death. While in the
last decades of the twentieth century cultural recognition attempted to
give visibility to what total war had erased, an effort that could
generate positive effects, like reparation or affirmation, or more
aporetic ones, like the impossibility of bridging the gap between
visibility and invisibility amidst the infinite dimensions of justice,
survival copes instead with the fact that, within global war, life and
death are two absolute conditions, with no possible bridge or dialogue
between them. Death produced by total war resulted in cultural exclusion
and social destruction and, as psychoanalysis and trauma studies have
analyzed, death marked the beginning of endless chains of haunting
specters and mourning acts. Death under global war, in contrast, is as
constituent as life. It is as destructive as it is constructive. It is
not hidden but fully exposed. It has no function in the structuring of
social life other than being productive elimination. Survival is
therefore the task of escaping death and establishing no connection to
it. But we should not understand the new conjuncture as a return to a
pre-political stage where homo homini lupus est. **[Global war
is]{.underline}** not the situation previous to sovereign power and in
which, in Hobbes's famous phrase, there is "continual fear and danger of
violent death, and \[where\] the life of man \[is\] solitary, poor,
nasty, brutish, and short." In fact, we may define it as the exact
opposite, that is, as **[the post-political condition that results from
the crumbling of the state's monopoly on violence]{.underline}**. The
absence of an indisputable sovereign power that can limit the spaces of
life and death produces a sense of permanent threat and an apocalyptic
structure of feeling. Global war entails the end of Carl Schmitt's
katechon, that is, the demise of "the power that prevents the
long-overdue apocalyptic end of times from already happening now." In
this conjuncture, **[survival is an unregulated struggle to live on,
with no form of governmentality that directs it]{.underline}** and no
katechontic principle that controls it. One often encounters the idea
that the so-called "survival of the fittest" encapsulates the
governmentality of our times**[. The premise is that we inhabit a sort
of capitalist jungle in which only the strong survive and
where]{.underline}**, as Guns'n'Roses used to sing, "**[ya learn to live
like an animal in the jungle where we play]{.underline}**." **[Yet the
problem with this]{.underline}** ideologeme **[is]{.underline}** not so
much that it justifies the colossal inequalities produced by economic
competition, but rather that **[it applies the rational template of the
law of the stronger on a global reality in which the rationalities of
modernity have imploded]{.underline}**. The logic of
**[survival]{.underline}** does not refer to the post-evental
circumstance of those who come out alive from a war or those who win in
an economic battle. Rather, **[it defines an ongoing and productive
condition determined by the presence of immediate
catastrophe]{.underline}**. In this context, **[political practices are
no longer oriented toward the modern question of]{.underline}**
convivance and living together, **[but]{.underline}**, as French
anthropologist Marc Abélès writes, they result from what he calls
"**[the interiorization of the survival problem]{.underline}**." For
Abélès, the reflections and practices that go from the construction of
Hobbes's Leviathan to the implementation of the Keynesian welfare state,
aimed at finding the best possible political form for the organization
of the living together of human beings. Within globalization, in
contrast, "the political field finds itself overrun by a gnawing
interrogation concerning the uncertainty and threats that the future
possesses." But Abélès **[explains the transition from modern convivance
to postmodern survival in terms of biopolitics, and he defines
"survival" as the "biopolitical dimension" of neoliberal
governmentality.]{.underline}** As is known, for Foucault **[the
imperative of the]{.underline}** biopolitical **[state is]{.underline}**
"to 'make' live and 'let' die," that is, **[to regulate
life]{.underline}** and pursue the disciplining and subsequent
purification of the social body **[for the extraction of surplus
labor]{.underline}**. It is true that, in Foucault, biopolitics do not
lead to a positive organization of convivance but rather to a system of
terror of which the Nazi state is "the paroxysmal development." However,
**[the genocidal logic of the biopolitical state was not oriented toward
the administration of future uncertainty]{.underline}**. Systematic
massacring did not pursue the control of future threats, but continued
to organize convivance by means of a radical extirpation of the
perverted and inoperative elements of the population. For this reason,
if the contemporary regime of survival is not about organizing communal
living-together, then it cannot be biopolitical. Biopower is not the
primary catalyzer of the new world order. But let's now focus on the
productive energies of the regime of survival. The interiorization of
survival by individuals, which is a way of inserting the work of the
state into one's subjectivity, compels everyone to play a protective but
also entrepreneurial role in the social field. Thus, survival takes
multiple forms of intervention. It may consist in the direct attack on
other positions that are not necessarily dominant or oppressive, but
that are perceived as threats in a given moment. It may be the effort to
protect an inherited body of knowledge against external contamination or
internal dissent. It can operate as preemptive manhunt that neutralizes
future conflicts. It can develop guerrilla tactics, with hide-and-seek
movements and specific targets. It can consist of mafia politics based
on friendship and alliances of common interests. It can take the shape
of a covert operation in the sphere of infowar and cyberwar. It can be
violent or non-violent, physical or symbolic, melodramatic or
unspectacular, real or virtual, or a combination of both, or a synthesis
of all of the above. This brief list of forms is indicative of one
central aspect: the neutral ideology of the work of survival. Survival
is neither progressive nor reactionary; it is indeterminate and generic.
It is a standard principle imposed on all political and critical
interventions, and yet it does not make interventions indifferent to the
world. On the contrary, the work of survival transforms all social
practices into interventionist practices. Each individual and collective
action becomes effectively militant and activist.

//pyrex ultra

In mid-September 2014, [two days after the largest climate march in
history made its way through New York City's]{.underline} Midtown
Manhattan area, President [Obama announced]{.underline} that he had just
launched [a heavy airstrike against militants in Syria]{.underline}---in
effect, [plunging the United States further into an unending military
quagmire in the Middle East]{.underline}. He then proceeded, on the same
day, to go to the United Nations to claim he was serious about tackling
climate change. There was something surreal about the juxtaposition of
these two announcements. It was as if climate change and war were
distinct ontological categories when, in fact, they are symbiotically
related. Climate Change as a Cause of War [Competition over
resources---land, water, minerals, energy---has for hundreds of years
been the ground of conflicts within and between nations]{.underline}
despite the fact that such conflicts may also be triggered by ethnic,
religious, ideological, or national rivalries. The colonial conquest of
the Americas was all about resources: gold, silver, tin, rubber. The
modern wars in Africa have often been driven by competition for
diamonds, oil, and other precious minerals, but [the growing
climate-induced desertification of large swaths of the continent is
fueling further conflict.]{.underline} **[The rise of Boko Haram in
Nigeria, for example, has been traced to severe drought in the region,
causing the disruption of normal patterns of life and leaving people "in
a chaotic state of absolute poverty and social
dislocation."]{.underline}**1 The so-called pastoralist corridor
straddling the borderlands of Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and
Somalia has seen increasingly extreme weather patterns---drought and
flash flooding--- which have resulted in a toxic convergence of poverty,
climate change, failed or failing states, and consequent inter-tribal or
religiously infused violence.2 [Central and South Asia are other areas
that are already experiencing the intermixture of extreme climate events
with political violence.]{.underline} "Read the history of the war in
Afghanistan closely," says Christian Parenti in his eye-opening book,
Tropic of Chaos, "and a climate angle emerges."3 [The area has been
suffering droughts and floods "that fit the pattern of anthropogenic
global warming.]{.underline}" The region saw increasing violence even
before the American presence, starting with a drought in 1969 that
resulted in a mass famine and consequent political chaos. More recently,
the Taliban has taken advantage of the dissolution of traditional bonds
of solidarity and loss of livelihoods that have resulted from such
weather events. For example, [drought has wiped out Afghanistan's wheat
crop, leaving thousands of farmers destitute. The Taliban has
reintroduced poppy cultivation (which they once prohibited) as a means
of providing these farmers with a living as poppies require only a third
of the water needed for wheat.]{.underline} Profits from heroin sales,
in turn, finance their movement. The modern era's first climate change
refugees were some five hundred thousand Bangladeshis, left homeless by
the flooding of their island in 2005. Bangladesh has seen frequent
outbreaks of public unrest and terrorism as a result of such upheaval.
Due to rising sea levels, an estimated twenty-two million people in
Bangladesh will become climate refugees by 2050. Anticipating this
event, India is already completing a militarized border fence along its
2,500-mile frontier with Bangladesh.4 But [India, too, is suffering from
internal conflict related to climate change]{.underline}. The often
violent guerilla movement known as the Naxalite movement is situated
along the fault lines of a pattern of drought.5 [An estimated 1.3
billion people on the Indian sub-continent depend on runoff from the
Himalayan Glaciers]{.underline}.6 Erratic monsoon patterns resulting in
both massive floods and droughts have contributed to numerous
inter-communal conflicts and mass suicides across the region. If the
glaciers disappear, one can only imagine the chaos that will ensue. Add
to this volatile mix the violence that wracks Pakistan. The religious
fanaticism of the area is also linked to declining water resources.7
[The Syrian war was ignited when the government failed to respond to the
most severe drought in Syria's history \[between 2006 and 2011\].
Although political violence in the Middle East is riven by
inter-religious conflict, beneath these conflicts also lurks the reality
of climate change.]{.underline} [The so-called Arab Spring began as a
protest against the rising cost of food---the result of droughts and
floods in the wheat-producing countries]{.underline} that supply Egypt
with wheat---and then morphed into a movement for democratization.8 The
Syrian war was ignited when the government failed to respond to the most
severe drought in Syria's history, which occurred between 2006 and 2011,
driving dispossessed farmers into the cities where they became recruits
for the Syrian resistance movement.9 Last summer, the United Nations
reported that since the start of the Syrian war, the supply of safe
water has dropped by twothirds and that drought also threatens to put
new pressures on Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, exacerbating conflict and
refugee flows in an area already roiling with them.10 [The Israeli--
Palestinian conflict also has scarce water as one of its drivers. Israel
controls the greater part of the Jordan River basin and the aquifers
that run under the West Bank---the major source of water for this arid
region, depriving Palestinian communities of access to fresh water.
While maldistribution is currently one of the sources of this conflict,
as climate change worsens, there will only be more conflict over this
vital source of life.]{.underline} Today, in a world faced with
dwindling resources---of potable water, arable land, fisheries, easily
extracted fossil fuels---and growing consumption due to population
increase and a rapacious economic system based on endless growth,
resource-related conflicts are becoming more widespread and violent. But
the very conflicts generated by such resource competition end up
despoiling the environment, thus creating more conflict. Despite the
hopeful steps taken in Lima, Peru in December 2014---where countries
committed themselves to reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions---none of the world's major powers have been willing to
renounce militarism or curb the trade in weapons. Between 2001 and 2013,
global military spending increased by an estimated 90 percent.11
Although U.S. military expenditures had begun to fall in recent years as
a result of the recession, the ending of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and the congressional sequester, the U.S. fiscal year 2014
budget called for enhancing the Administration's commitment to
maintaining a reliable nuclear deterrent by increasing investments in
the nuclear weapons complex and delivery systems.12 [The Impact of
Militarism on Climate Change As a response to political conflict,
**militarism** seems to be **the** world's **modus operandi**. Yet
**militarism** itself is a major, but overlooked contributor to climate
change. The Pentagon is the world's largest industrial consumer of
**fossil fuels**. Fighter jets, destroyers, tanks, and other weapons
systems emit highly toxic, carbon intensive emissions, not to mention
the GHGs that are released from the detonation of bombs.]{.underline}
Collins 27 [To understand the impact of our commitment to militarism,
one has to take into account not only the carbon dioxide equivalent13 of
the fuels that are directly used by the military]{.underline} (for
transportation and in the building of military infrastructure, weapons,
and so on) [but also those related to the U.S. military's role in
protecting global maritime petroleum distribution, as well as the wars
in the Middle East related to securing global petroleum
reserves.]{.underline} Despite the Pentagon's decision to include more
biofuels in its energy mix, the GHG emissions from the production of
biofuels, as well as their indirect effects, also need to be measured. A
study published in 2010 estimated that total emissions from U.S.
conventional military fuel use and acquisitions totaled about 172
million metric tons (MMt) of CO2 equivalent per year. Of that, an
estimated 16 MMt of CO2 equivalent per year may be attributed to the
military's role in securing global oil supplies.14 An additional 43.3
MMt is attributed to the Iraq war. [To get some idea of this military
contribution to global warming, consider that 172 million MMt is roughly
equivalent to driving an average passenger vehicle four and a half
billion miles a year, or burning almost 185 billion pounds of
coal]{.underline}.15 The Pentagon is the world's largest industrial
consumer of fossil fuels. Moreover, [unlike warfare before the twentieth
century---where weapons were used to kill by piercing and crushing human
bodies---twentieth- and twenty-first-century warfare is designed to kill
by destroying and poisoning the enemy's environment, making such
warfare--- even setting aside its contribution to GHG
emissions---**qualitatively more environmentally
destructive**]{.underline}.16 [Not only are modern weapons
environmentally destructive when used but also the extraction,
production, transporting, storing, and testing of the materials used in
them leaves its own toxic trail.]{.underline} Think of the history of
[uranium production and testing, or the nine hundred toxic military
production sites that dot the American landscape, turning thousands of
acres into uninhabitable "sacrifice zones." More than twelve thousand
U.S. military sites where weapons testing takes place have been found to
release perchlorate, a toxic chemical that affects thyroid and
respiratory function, into the groundwater.17 More than twelve thousand
U.S. military sites where weapons testing takes place have been found to
release \[into the groundwater\] a toxic chemical that affects thyroid
and respiratory function.]{.underline} The United States and its allies
have spent trillions financing anti-terrorist military operations in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The United States alone spent \$2.6
trillion between 2001 and 2014 but has taken obligations to spend as
much as \$4.4 trillion.18 Moreover, [as the largest arms supplier (and
importer) in the world, the United States fuels **conflicts** directly
and indirectly. Many of these weapons fall into the hands of non-state
actors like ISIS and Boko Haram, thus multiplying the arenas of military
conflict]{.underline}. Although the terrible social, cultural, and
economic costs are publicly discussed, [little is said about the
environmental costs of such wars,]{.underline} and little research has
been conducted into these costs, leaving the public in ignorance and
without the knowledge necessary to question and challenge the military's
role.19 To make matters worse, the military sector---with the exception
of the military's domestic fuel use, that is, the emissions related to
the military's use of fossil fuels within the United States but not
abroad---is excluded from UN inventories of national GHG emissions,
thanks to intensive lobbying by the United States at the Kyoto Protocol
negotiations.20 The exclusion of much of the military sector from
national GHG inventories thus makes a mockery of the UN climate
negotiations process. The exclusion of much of the military sector from
national greenhouse gas inventories makes a mockery of the UN climate
negotiations process. How quickly the world has forgotten the terrible
environmental legacies of past wars! [During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
army sprayed eighty million liters of the defoliant Agent
Orange---containing the highly toxic chemical dioxin, as well as other
herbicides---over more than 24 percent of the land area of South
Vietnam, leaving nearly five million acres of denuded or heavily
defoliated upland and coastal forests---about 36 percent of the total
mangrove forest, an ecosystem rich in biodiversity---and damaging some
five hundred thousand acres of rice and other crops. It will take
centuries to reproduce the ecologically balanced mix of flora and fauna
that once thrived there]{.underline}.21 Between 2.1 to 4.8 million
Vietnamese were directly exposed to Agent Orange and other herbicides
during the War, as were thousands of U.S. soldiers. [As late as 2014,
children were still being born with birth defects from the
poison]{.underline}. **[During the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein set an
estimated eight hundred Kuwaiti oil wells ablaze]{.underline}**. The
thick plumes of smoke that rose as high as six kilometers into the
atmosphere produced an estimated three thousand four hundred metric tons
of soot per day. More than twenty times the amount of oil that was
spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska flowed into the Persian
Gulf, causing irreparable harm to the Gulf's ecological integrity.22
Having learned nothing from these disasters, [we now have the spectacle
of the United States bombing oil refineries in Syria in an attempt to
~~cripple~~ \[destroy\] the oil revenue stream to ISIS.]{.underline} The
president and congressional hawks are escalating **[military policies in
the Middle East that will quicken climate change and exacerbate further
conflict.]{.underline}** The president and congressional hawks are now
escalating military policies in the Middle East that will only quicken
climate change and, in turn, exacerbate further conflict. It is not as
if Obama does not know about the link between war and climate change. He
has surely read or heard about a 2003 Pentagon study that raised the
possibility that should GHG emissions rise above a certain level, there
could be an abrupt change in weather patterns causing a decrease in net
global agricultural production that would destabilize the geopolitical
environment and create a greater threat to world stability than
terrorism.23 This was a worst-case scenario when the report was written
but one that scientists fear is becoming more and more possible unless
we move quickly to drastically reduce global emissions.24 The president
and members of Congress must also surely know about the last three
Pentagon Quadrennial Defense Reviews that characterize climate change as
a "threat multiplier."25 In an interview with Thomas Friedman for the
film series Years of Living Dangerously, Obama admitted he was worried
that "climate change could end up having profound national security
implications in poorer countries."26 Challenging Militarism's Role in
Climate Change [For the most part, the environmental movement has not
made the case that climate change and war are Siamese twins. Nor has a
less visible peace movement linked war with climate change,]{.underline}
although that may be beginning to change. Although trade unions in other
parts of the world have taken up the fight against climate change, the
mainstream U.S. labor movement, with some exceptions,27 has been slow to
get involved and, in fact, is riven by internal conflict over the
issue.28 Michael Klare and Christian Parenti, who have both written on
resource conflicts,29 and H. Patricia Hynes, who has written on the
military's impact on climate change,30 as well as the International
Peace Bureau,31 are the exceedingly rare voices making the case that
there can be no climate change mitigation without peace and no peace
without moving swiftly to provide the poorer parts of the world with the
resources needed to adapt to climate change and build resilient
economies. In 2013, world military expenditures amounted to \$1.75
trillion.32 Such yearly outlays rob national treasuries of the resources
needed to provide funds for climate mitigation and adaptation. [At the
UN summit on climate change held in Lima, Peru in November 2014, the
world's nations pledged \$10.2 billion to finance the Green Climate
Fund---a pool of money dedicated to helping developing countries reduce
their GHGs and adapt to inevitable climate changes. **That is a mere
fraction (.584 percent) of what they spend in just one year on
militarism**]{.underline}. If President Obama is serious about climate
Collins 29 change, he should be calling on Congress as well as on other
governments to put much more money than has been pledged so far into
helping poorer nations adapt to climate change and leapfrog into green
economies as a way of ensuring international security. [Just think what
even a quarter of that \$1.75 trillion spent on weapons of war could do
to reduce international tensions and build sustainable
communities.]{.underline} In 1990, the executive secretary of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, in
a speech to the Congress of Deputies of Spain, argued that ["the very
scale of the security problem in a world that begins to panic over the
advanced impacts of climate change could overwhelm any single country's
ability to defend against it,]{.underline} let alone pay the cost to do
so." She then went on to ask, What will be better? To continue to
support a traditional global military budget that has risen 50 percent
in real terms from 2000 to 2009 and continues to increase? Or to
increase a preventive military budget investing into adaptation and
low-carbon growth and avoid climate chaos that would demand a defense
response that makes even today's spending burden look light?33 Today,
that question remains to be answered. It is time to connect the dots.

At least until 2050, and possibly for decades after, [climate change
will remain a **creeping threat** that will **exacerbate and amplify**
existing, **structural** global **inequalities**]{.underline}. While the
developed world will be negatively affected by climate change through
2050, the consequences of climate change will be felt most acutely in
the developing world. The national security threats posed by climate
change to 2050 are likely to differ in degree, not kind, from the kinds
of threats already posed by climate change. For the next few decades,
[climate change will **exacerbate humanitarian
crises**]{.underline}---[some of which will result in the deployment of
**military personnel**]{.underline}, as well as material and financial
assistance. [It will]{.underline} also **[aggravate]{.underline}**
natural **[resource constraints]{.underline}**, potentially
[contributing to]{.underline} political and economic [**conflict** over
**water**, **food** and **energy**]{.underline}. The question for the
next 30 years is not "can humanity survive as a species with 1.5°C or
2°C of warming," but, "how much will the existing disparities between
the developed and developing world widen, and how long (and how
successfully) can these widening political/economic disparities be
sustained?" The urgency of the climate threat in the next few decades
will depend, to a large degree, on whether and how much the U.S.
government perceives a widening of these global inequities as a threat
to U.S. national security. By contrast, [if emissions continue to
**creep upward**]{.underline} (or if they do not decline rapidly), by
2100 climate-related national security [threats could be
**existential**]{.underline}. [The question for the next hundred years
is not]{.underline}, "are disparities politically and economically
manageable?" but, "[can the **global order**, premised on the
**nation-state system**, itself based on territorial sovereignty,
**survive** in a world in which **substantial swathes of territory** are
potentially **uninhabitable**]{.underline}?" National Security
Consequences of Climate Change to 2050 Scientists can predict the
consequences of climate change to 2050 with some measure of certainty.
(Beyond that date, the pace and magnitude of climate change---and
therefore, the national security threat posed by it---depend heavily on
the level of emissions in the coming years, as I have explained.) There
is relative agreement across modeled climate scenarios that the world
will likely warm, on average, at least 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels
by about 2050---but perhaps as soon as 2030. This level of warming is
likely to occur even if the world succeeds in dramatically reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, as even the recent Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) report implicitly admits. In other words, a
certain amount of additional warming---at least 1.5°C, and probably more
than that---is presumptively unavoidable. Looking ahead to 2050, it can
be said with relative confidence that the national security consequences
of climate change will vary in degree, not in kind, from the national
security threats already facing the United States. This is hardly good
news. [Even **small differences** in global average **temperatures**
result in **significant environmental changes**, with attendant
**social**, **economic** and **political consequences**]{.underline}. By
2050, [climate change will **wreak increasing havoc** on **human** and
**natural systems**]{.underline}---predominantly, but not exclusively,
in the developing world---[with]{.underline} attenuated but [**profound
consequences** for **national security**]{.underline}. In particular,
[changes in **temperature**, the **hydrological cycle** and the **ranges
of insects** will impact **food availability** and food access in much
of the world, increasing food insecurity]{.underline}. [**Storms**,
**flooding**, **changes in ocean pH** and other climate-linked changes
will damage **infrastructure** and negatively impact **labor
productivity** and economic **growth**]{.underline} in much of the
world. [Vector-borne **diseases** will also become **more
prevalent**]{.underline}, [as climate change will expand the geographic
**range** and **intensity** of **transmission** of diseases like
malaria, West Nile, Zika and dengue fever, and cholera]{.underline}.
[Rising **public health challenges**, **economic devastation** and
**food insecurity** will translate into an increased **demand** for
**humanitarian assistance** provided by the **military**, increased
**migration**]{.underline}---especially from tropical and subtropical
regions---[and **geopolitical conflict**]{.underline}. Long-term trends
such as declining food security, coupled with short-term events like
hurricanes, could sustain unprecedented levels of migration. The 2015
refugee crisis in Europe portends the kinds of population movements that
will only accelerate in the coming decades: people from Africa,
Southwest and South Asia and elsewhere crossing land and water to reach
Europe. For the United States, this likely means greater numbers of
people seeking entry from both Central America and the Caribbean. Such
influxes are not unprecedented, but they are unlikely to abate and could
increase in volume over the next few decades, driven in part by climate
change-related food insecurity, climate change-related storms and also
by economic and political instability. Food insecurity, economic losses
and loss of human life are also likely to exacerbate existing political
tensions in the developing world, especially in regions with poor
governance and/or where the climate is particularly vulnerable to
warming (e.g., the Mediterranean basin). While the Arab Spring had many
underlying causes, it also coincided with a period of high food prices,
which arguably contributed to the protests. In some situations, [**food
insecurity**, **economic losses** and **public health crises**, combined
with **weak** and ineffectual **governance**, could **precipitate future
conflicts**]{.underline} of this kind---although it will be difficult to
know where and when without more precise local studies of both
underlying political dynamics and the regionally-specific impacts of
climate change. 2100 and Beyond While the national security impacts of
climate change to 2050 are likely to be costly and disruptive for the
U.S. military---and devastating for many people around the world---at
some point after 2050, if warming continues at its current pace,
[changes to the climate could **fundamentally reshape
geopolitics**]{.underline} and possibly even the current nation-state
basis of the current global order. To be clear, both the ultimate level
of warming and its attendant political consequences is highly
speculative, for the reasons I explained in my last post. Nonetheless,
we do know that the planet is currently on track for at least 3-4°C of
warming by 2100. The "known knowns" of higher levels of warming---say,
3°C---are frightening. At that 3°C of warming, for example, scientists
project that [there will]{.underline} be a nearly [**70 percent
decline** in **wheat** production in **Central America** and the
Caribbean]{.underline}, [**75 percent** of the **land area** in the
**Mid**dle **East**]{.underline} and more than [50 percent in South Asia
will be affected by highly unusual heat, and **sea level rise** could
**displace** and imperil the lives **hundreds of millions** of
people]{.underline}, among other consequences. But [even higher levels
of warming are physically possible within this century]{.underline}. At
these levels of warming, [some **regions of the world** would be
**literally uninhabitable**]{.underline}, likely resulting in the
depopulation of the tropics, [to say nothing of the consequences of
**sea-level rise** for **economically important cities** such as
Amsterdam and New York]{.underline}. [Even if newly warmed regions of
the far north could **theoretically accommodate** the resulting
**migrants**, this **presumes** that the **political response** to this
unprecedented **global displacement** would be **orderly** and
**conflict-free** **borders on fantasy**]{.underline}. The geopolitical
consequences of significant levels of warming are severe, but if these
changes occur in a linear way, at least there will be time for human
systems to adjust. Perhaps [more challenging for national security is
the possibility that the until-now **linear changes give way** to
**abrupt** and **irreversible ones**]{.underline}. Scientists forecast
that, [at higher levels of warming]{.underline}---precisely what level
is speculative---[humanity could trigger **catastrophic**, **abrupt**
and **unavoidable consequences** to the **ecosystem**]{.underline}. [The
IPCC has considered **nine** such abrupt changes]{.underline}; [one
example is the]{.underline} potential [**shutting down** of the **Indian
summer monsoon**]{.underline}. [Over a **billion** people are
**dependent** upon the Indian monsoon]{.underline}, [which provides
parts of South Asia with about 80 percent of its annual
rainfall]{.underline}; relatively minor changes in the monsoon in either
direction can cause disasters. In 2010, a wetter monsoon led to the
catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, which directly affected 20 million
people; a drier monsoon in 2002 led to devastating drought. Studies
suggest that the Indian summer monsoon has two stable states: wet (i.e.,
the current state) and dry (characterized by low precipitation over the
subcontinent). At some point, if warming continues, the monsoon could
abruptly shift into the second, "dry" state, with catastrophic
consequences for over a billion people dependent on monsoon-fed
agriculture. The IPCC suggests that such a state-shift is
"unlikely"---that is, there is a 10 to 33 percent chance that a
state-shift will happen in the 21st century---but scientists also have
relatively low confidence in their understanding of the underlying
mechanisms in this and other large-scale natural systems. The
consequences of abrupt, severe warming for national security are obvious
in general, if unclear in the specifics. In 2003, [the Defense
Department]{.underline} asked a [contractor]{.underline} to explore such
a scenario. The resulting report outlined the offensive and defensive
national security strategies countries may adopt if faced with abrupt
climate change, and [highlighted the **increased risk** of inter- and
intra-state **conflict** over natural **resources** and
**immigration**]{.underline}. Although the report may be off in its
imagined timeframe (positing abrupt climate change by 2020), the world
it conjures is improbable but not outlandish. If the Indian monsoon were
to switch to dry state, and a billion people were suddenly without
reliable food sources, for example, it is not clear how the Indian
government would react, assuming it would survive in its current form.
Major wars or low-intensity proxy conflicts seem likely, if not
inevitable, in such a scenario. This is not to say that a parade of
climate horribles is certain---or even likely---to come to pass.
Scientific understanding of the sensitivities in the climate system are
far from perfect. It is also possible that emissions will decline more
rapidly than anticipated, averting the worst consequences of climate
change. But this outcome is far from guaranteed. And even if global
emissions decline precipitously, humanity cannot be sure when or whether
the planet has crossed a climate tipping point beyond which the
incremental nature of the current changes shifts from the current
linear, gradual progression to a non-linear and abrupt process. Within
the next few decades, the most likely scenario involves manageable, but
costly, consequences on infrastructure, food security and natural
disasters, which will be borne primarily by the world's most
impoverished citizens and the members of the military who provide them
with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. But [**while** the
head-turning national security **impacts** of climate change are
**probably** several **decades away**, the **nature of the threat** is
such that **waiting until** these **changes manifest** is **not a viable
option**]{.underline}. [By the time the climate consequences are severe
enough to compel action, there is likely to be little that can be done
on human timescales to undo the changes to **environmental systems** and
the **human societies dependent upon them**]{.underline}.

### Securitization

#### National Security and Militarism have always already been a form of violence through exceptionalism structural violence that is reproduced through state-sanctioned logics

critical feminist lens," Security Dialogue 49(1-2):136-148, Professor of
Politics and International Studies as well as the director of the Peace
and Justice Studies program) xx-xx-2018 //pyrex ultra

A conversation on 'Feminist Security Studies and Today's Challenges' at
the 2014 International Feminist Journal of Politics conference
illustrated that the scope of feminist perspectives on security remains
unsettled.3 Both Enloe and Carol Cohn, feminist pioneers studying
militarism, were reluctant to consider themselves scholars of security.
They had learned early in their careers to stay clear of strategic or
security studies to avoid co-optation into the agendas of these deeply
militarized fields of study (see e.g. Cohn, 1989). At the same time,
[Enloe mused at the roundtable, putting 'feminist' in front of security
studies might change the scope of the field -- also because the work
that feminist security studies scholars are doing acutely attends to how
insecurities are gendered, raced, classed, and more]{.underline}. Saying
'feminist' out loud can be a way to consciously resist cooptation or
complicity; as Linda Åhäll puts it, 'a feminist perspective, albeit in
different ways, puts politics -- and thereby power -- at the core of the
analysis' (Åhäll, 2016: 157, emphasis in original). Here, [feminist
reflexivity and a willingness to constantly rethink one's engagements
and prejudices are explicitly foregrounded]{.underline} -- as [is a
commitment to thinking about how **scholarship is always already
political**]{.underline} (see Åhäll, 2016; Baker et al., 2016; Enloe,
2016). In my contribution to the roundtable, I agreed with Enloe and
noted the distinctiveness of feminist security studies: [while many
critical security scholars have been sympathetic to feminist concerns
and might embrace an emancipatory agenda, they 'tend not to ask feminist
research questions]{.underline} ... and do not base their research on
women's experiences. As a result, [they find themselves with strikingly
different research agendas, findings, and policy
recommendations']{.underline} (Wibben, 2011: 112). In paying detailed
attention to the ways in which [everyday experiences of differently
located subjects]{.underline} (not just those identified as women!) [are
gendered, but also raced, classed, sexualized, and more]{.underline},
critical feminists have developed an impressive and innovative body of
work, especially also concerning militarism and militarization.4
'[Militarisation as a security puzzle forms part of sensemaking in the
everyday']{.underline}, proposes Åhäll, [and]{.underline} consequently
'[feminist contributions to security studies have a different
"entry-point" ... a focus on the **everyday** as the site where the
political puzzle is found']{.underline} (Åhäll, 2016: 155, emphasis in
original). [This **contrasts sharply with international relations**,
where, since 'one can concentrate exclusively on states and their
"behavior," **questions of human agency and identity fall to the
wayside**]{.underline}. [No children are ever born, and nobody ever
dies, in this constructed world]{.underline}. **[There are
states]{.underline}**, **[and they are what is]{.underline}**'
(Elshtain, 1987: 91). [Feminist scholarship on security as a
concept]{.underline} (e.g. Detraz, 2012; Sjoberg, 2013; Stern, 2005;
Tickner, 1992, 2001; Wibben, 2011) [reveals how **security is profoundly
gendered** and how the **parameters of traditional**]{.underline}, [and
even critical, security narratives **make the inclusion of (women's)
everyday experience difficult**]{.underline}. Feminist security studies
hence provides complex and fruitful analyses of some of the core issues
of security studies -- by eschewing this work, security studies
impoverishes itself.5 Paying close attention to the impact of security
policies on the everyday lives of people during peace- and wartime and
questioning the purportedly neat separation of pre- and postwar spheres,
[feminist scholars poignantly identify a **continuum of violence** that
spans these spatial and temporal locales]{.underline} (e.g. Cockburn,
1998, 2004, 2007; Reardon, 1993). They map how [(in)securities shift and
slide along with subjectivities on axes of oppression, particularly when
gender, race, or class are foregrounded]{.underline}. Maria Stern's work
on Guatemala, for example, reveals complex formations of Mayan women's
identity, which are tied to their gender, their relation to the dominant
Ladino society, and to class. Further, their identification as campesina
highlights 'the spiritual and cultural connection to the land' (Stern,
2005: 115). Taken together, [this means that any 'in/security
configuration that was formed in tandem with these identity
constellations could **neither be partitioned off into separate
"security" needs**, nor for that matter, **specific
threats'**]{.underline} (Stern, 2005: 115). By focusing on everyday
(in)securities, [feminist scholars **challenge static understandings of
security**]{.underline} (see e.g. Kinsella, 2007; Sjoberg, 2013; Stern,
2005; Tickner, 1992) [and provide ample evidence that state or national
security frameworks not only **fail to deliver security**]{.underline},
especially for marginalized members of society, [but are themselves
**significantly implicated in producing insecurities**]{.underline}.
[Studying militarism, as ideology but also in terms of how its logics
are actualized in the lives of civilians and service members as well as
in society in general through **processes of
militarization**,]{.underline} has long allowed feminist researchers to
take a closer look at a range of security policies and their effects. At
the same time, traditional security studies has remained largely static
in its approach to security. While critical scholarship on security has
deepened and broadened the agenda to explore a wider scope of security
issues, as long as security studies aims to identify threats and develop
means to counter or contain them, therewith treating security as an
achievable condition or thing, it continuously fails to grasp the
shifting (in)security configurations feminist scholars point to. What is
more, [security as currently imagined and exemplified in (state)
practices remains **thoroughly dependent on militarist
logics**]{.underline} (i.e. militarized). Consequently, critical and
feminist scholars who study non-military security issues still need to
be cognizant of militarism and its effects. Otherwise their scholarship
risks contributing to the militarization of ever more areas in the
process of securitizing new issues, as many critics have pointed out
(e.g. Deudney, 1990, Mabee and Vucetic, this issue). Let us unpack these
claims: [if security is indeed a **self-referential
practice**]{.underline}, as critical scholars propose, [then it
establishes a security situation through a **process of securitization
rather than referring to an external 'reality'**]{.underline} -- [and
this is an **intensely political move**]{.underline} (Wibben, 2016b).
Indeed, ['"security" is not a universal need nor a universal concept,
but a **function of discourse**, a function within a **specific and
modern discursive economy of the political'**]{.underline} (Dillon,
1990: 110). **[Security orders social relations]{.underline}**, it
positions people, [and it has **effects on life and
death**]{.underline}. Responding to Ole Wæver's (1995) introduction of
the idea of securitization, Jef Huysmans proposes that we think in terms
of logics of security, 'an ensemble of rules that is immanent to a
security practice and that defines that practice in its particularity'
(Huysmans, 1998: 232; see also Huysmans, 2006). Crucially, this
description of security as a self-referential practice is based on an
attempt to make sense of the concept of security as states employ it, as
Buzan et al. (1998) explicitly acknowledge in their classic statement on
securitization. These state practices, however, depend on a close
alignment of security and militarism.6 This alignment exists not least
because the concept of 'security' developed from 'military strategy',
alongside the move from War Departments to Defense Departments, without
a corresponding process of demilitarization. For the US context, Bradley
Klein (1997: 362) has described this shift from strategic studies to
security studies as a deliberately political move: The postwar shift in
the United States from the War Department to the Defense Department
suggests that the manipulation of force must find politically acceptable
guises for itself.... \[S\]ecurity studies was entirely a product of the
post-World War II environment, when liberal societies undertook projects
of both decolonizing and maintaining global order under Western
protection and coordination. Consequently, more often than not,
securitization does not just ring the alarm bell of security (Glasius,
2008) and provide much-needed attention to important issues, but
potentially militarizes ever more areas of life. This is notable in the
way in which the UN's Women, Peace and Security Agenda, despite its
emergence from an anti-militarist feminist activist tradition, has
become increasingly narrowly focused on gender mainstreaming in
militaries (Shepherd, 2016; Wright, 2016), as well as in the deployment
of militaries in response to disasters (Parashar, this issue). [To go
beyond the self-referential logic of security, it is necessary therefore
to **tackle the militarist logics embedded in conceptions of security**
as they are currently employed in security studies]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [military power in various guises remains one of the primary
means by which key states like the USA seek security]{.underline}. [This
militarist mindset]{.underline} is not just reflected in the use of
militaries to achieve policy aims, but also [entails the subscription to
militarist logics that **value hierarchical orders** and the **promotion
of limited violence** to ensure peace]{.underline}. Importantly, while
large areas of life are militarized in this manner, militarism itself is
also changing. As Andrew Bacevich argues in The New American Militarism,
[the rise of US militarism that finds its expression in the ongoing war
on terror 'has deep roots in the American past \[and\] represents a
bipartisan project']{.underline} (Bacevich, 2013: 5). The current
developments, he proposes, started in the aftermath of the Vietnam War
when the officer corps of the US military attempted to achieve a
professional revival by reimagining war itself -- and in the process
eroded the heretofore-assumed distinction between military and civilian
arenas. [This finds expression in the now well-established figures of
the soldier-diplomat and, more recently, the
**soldier-scholar**]{.underline} (Khalili, 2010). 'With the events of
the 1990s \[Desert Storm in Kuwait, Operation Allied Force in Kosovo\]
blurring the distinction between war and politics, field commanders
began to fancy themselves clever enough to straddle both worlds and
master the art of "coercive diplomacy"' (Bacevich, 2013: 58).

### Scapegoating

#### State militarism produces gendered violence through scapegoating for war and subordination of the female body

\[Lauren **Wilcox 2015**\] (*Bodies of Violence: Theorizing Embodied
Subjects in International Relations*, University of Oxford Press,
<https://global.oup.com/academic/product/bodies-of-violence-9780199384488?cc=us&lang=en&>)
xx-xx-2015 //pyrex ultra

From this perspective, [violence both relies upon and reproduces
constructions of gender]{.underline}. [War is legitimated by gender
discourses that intersect with discourses of race, ethnicity, class,
nationality, and heterosexism to produce images of "innocent women" that
must be protected from "bad men" by the violence of "good
men]{.underline}" (Elshtain 1995 \[1987\]; Tickner 2001; Young 2003;
Sjoberg 2006). [Feminists have described the national security state as
a gendered and heterosexist "protection racket," in which the "natural"
sex of women stabilizes both domestic and international orders as the
patriarchal family is projected outward to states]{.underline} (Carver
2008, 83). Specifically, [the state is gendered masculine, while those
who are "protected" assume a feminine role, regardless of]{.underline}
their sexed [embodiment]{.underline}. [There is thus an unequal power
relationship between the protector and the protected]{.underline}, [with
the security of the protected bought by their subordination to the
protectors.]{.underline} Gender as a signifier of power is delinked from
the sexed bodies of men and women, so that some women can occupy the
powerful status of "man," while some men (often racial or sexual
"others") are feminized. "Man" in this sense is the abstract citizen or
human, unmarked by sex, whose violence is legitimized by its use against
a body marked by race, gender, or civilizational status, on behalf of
another population whose bodies are not "neutral" but marked, primarily
by gender. As Iris Marion Young puts it, "Their protector position puts
us, the citizens and residents who depend on their strength and
vigilance for our security, in the position of women and children under
the charge of the male protector" (2003, 226-- 227). [The bodies of the
feminized, "protected" by practices of national security, are a
political liability as their bodies are seen as vulnerable, weak, and
inadequate.]{.underline} [The association of women and femininity with
peace serves as the constitutive "other" against which "real" men are
created in and through war]{.underline} (Pin-Fat and Stern 2005). These
feminist stories critique and rewrite the traditional stories that IR
tells of violence, in both its realist and liberal variants. [It is,
first and foremost, a critique of the sovereign as protector from
violence against a neutral subject]{.underline}; feminists argue that
the subject of violence is not neutral in regard to gender. "Gender" as
a story of [the inherent weakness of women and the need for men to
protect them from "outside" enemies supports the patriarchal power of
men over women, as well as racial superiority in the image of the "bad
man" against whom the "just warrior" fights. The story told of a
sovereign who protects our "natural life"---either from a violent death,
or from violation of the private sphere of government interference---is
predicated upon gendered relations of power:]{.underline} the "natural"
weakness of **[women and their caretaking labor in the private sphere is
a political effect of gender discourses that support the existence of
hierarchical political institutions and practices of violence, rather
than an innate feature of human life.]{.underline}** Following
Foucault's use of military training techniques as examples of
disciplinary power (1979, 135--141), feminists in IR have focused on the
military as a particularly important site of the production of not only
masculine subjects, but masculine bodies (Hooper 2001; Belkin 2012).
Military bodies are also linked to rational-bureaucratic masculinity
(Hooper 2001, 64). [This form of masculinity merges with the traditional
warrior protector masculinity in Western high-tech
militaries]{.underline} (Masters 2005; Carver 2008). Masters argues
that, in such militaries, the cyborg is constituted at the expense of
fleshy body, a "living, laughing, loving body." The human body of the
soldier is weak and vulnerable, while information systems and high-tech
weapons are the strong protectors of this vulnerable body. As it is the
technology, then, that embodies masculinity, the male body of the
soldier has been feminized. Fleshy bodies have been effaced so that the
masculine dream of disembodiment and absolute knowledge and power can be
realized.

CM: Great to have you on the show.¶ Let's start with Occupy. What, to
you, explains the impact that the Tea Party had on Republicans, relative
to the impact that Occupy seems to have had on the Democratic Party? All
of the sudden there were "Tea Party Republicans." There weren't "Occupy
Democrats."¶ JD: That's a good point. [The Tea Party]{.underline} took
the Republican Party as its target. They [decided that their goal was
going to be to influence the political system]{.underline} by getting
people elected and basically [by trying to take over]{.underline} part
of [government. That's why they were able to have]{.underline} good
[effects. They didn't regard the mainstream political process as
something irrelevant to their concerns. They thought of it as something
to seize]{.underline}.¶ [The problem with many]{.underline}---but not
all---[[leftists in the US is that they think the political process is
so corrupted that we have to completely refuse it, and **leave it
altogether**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Tea Party decided to act as an
organized militant force, and [too much of the US left]{.underline} (we
saw this in the wake of Occupy) [has thought that to be "militant" means
to refuse and **disperse and become fragmented**]{.underline}.¶ CM: So
what explains the left turning its back on the collective action of a
political party? It would seem like a political party would fit into
what the left would historically want: an apparatus that can organize
collective action.¶ JD: [There are multiple things. First, the fear of
success]{.underline}: the left has learned from the excesses of the
twentieth century. [Where Communist]{.underline} and socialist [parties
"succeeded," there was violence]{.underline} and purges and repression.
One reason [the left has turned its back]{.underline} is [because of
this historical experience]{.underline} of state socialism. [And we have
taken that to mean that we should not ever have a state. I think that's
the wrong answer. That we]{.underline}---as the left---[made a mistake
with some regimes does not have to mean that we can never
learn]{.underline}.¶ [Another reason]{.underline} that th[e left has
turned its back on the party form has been the important criticism of
twentieth century parties that have been too white, too masculine,
potentially homophobic; parties that have operated in intensely
hierarchical fashion. **Those criticisms are real.** [**But rather than
saying we can't have a party form because that's just what a party does,
why not make a party that is not repressive** and does not
exclude]{.mark} or diminish people on the basis of sex, race, or
sexuality?]{.underline}¶ So we've got at least two historical problems
that have made people very reluctant to use the party. I also think
that, whether or not you mark it as 1968 or 1989, [the left's embrace of
cultural individualism and the free flow of personal experimentation has
made it critical of discipline and]{.underline} critical of
[collectivity. But]{.underline} I think [[**that's just a capitalist
sellout**. Saying everybody should just "do their own thing" is just
**going in the direction of the dominant culture**. That is actually not
a left position at]{.mark} all]{.underline}.¶ CM: So does [identity
politics undermine collectivism]{.underline}? [And]{.underline} did that
end up [lead]{.underline}ing [to fragmentation and a weakening of the
left]{.underline}? Because there are a lot of people we've had on the
show---and one person in particular, Thomas Frank---who say that there
is no left in the United States.¶ JD: First I want to say that I
disagree with the claim that there is no left. In fact, I think that
"the left" is that group that keeps denying its own existence. We're
always saying that we're the ones who don't exist. But the right thinks
that we exist. That's what is so fantastic, actually. Did you see the
New York Post screaming that Bernie Sanders is really a communist?
Great! They're really still afraid of communists! And it's people on the
left who say, "Oh, no, we're not here at all!"¶ The left denies its own
existence and it denies its own collectivity. Now, is identity politics
to blame? Maybe it's better to say that [identity politics has been a
symptom of the pressure of capitalism. Capitalism has operated in the US
by exacerbating racial differences]{.underline}. That has to be
addressed on the left, and [the left has been addressing that.
But]{.underline} we haven't been addressing it in a way that recognizes
how racism operates to support capitalism. Instead, [we've made it too
much about identity rather than as an element in building collective
solidarity]{.underline}.¶ I'm trying to find a way around this to
express that [identity politics has been important but it's reached its
limits. **Identity politics can't go any further insofar as it denies
the impact of capitalism**]{.underline}. An identity politics that just
rests on itself is nothing but liberalism. [Like all of the sudden
everything will be better if black people and white people are equally
exploited? What if black people and white people say, ["**No, we don't
want to live in a society based on
exploitation?**]{.mark}"]{.underline}¶ CM: You were saying that the left
denies its own collectivity. Is that only in the US? Is that unique to
the US culture of the left?¶ JD: That's a really important question, and
I'm not sure. Traveling in Europe, I see two different things. On the
one hand I see a broad left discussion that is, in part, mediated
through social media and is pretty generational---people in their
twenties and thirties or younger---and that [there's a general feeling
about the problem of collectivity, the problem of building something
with cohesion]{.underline}, and a temptation to just emphasize
multiplicity. You see this everywhere. Everybody worries about this, as
far as what I've seen.¶ On the other hand, there are countries whose
political culture has embraced parties much more, and fights politically
through parties. Like Greece, for example---and we've seen the ups and
downs with Syriza over the last two years. And Spain also. Because they
have a parliamentary system where small parties can actually get in the
mix and have a political effect---in ways that our two-party system
excludes---the European context allows for more enthusiasm for the party
as a form for politics.¶ But there's still a lot of disagreement on the
far left about whether or not the party form is useful, and shouldn't we
in fact retreat and have multiple actions and artistic events---you
know, the whole alter-globalization framework. That's still alive in a
lot of places. CM: You mentioned the structure of the US electoral
system doesn't allow for a political party to necessarily be the
solution for a group like Occupy. Is that one of the reasons that
activists dismiss the party structure as something that could help move
their agenda forward?¶ JD: [We can think about the Black Panther Party
as a neat example]{.underline} in the US context: [A party which was
operating not primarily to win elections but to galvanize social
power]{.underline}. That's an interesting way of thinking about what
else parties can do in the US.¶ [Or we can think about parties in terms
of local elections]{.underline}. Socialist Alternative has been doing
really neat work all over the country, organizing around local elections
with people running as socialist candidates not within a mainstream
party. I think that even as we come up against the limits of a two-party
system, we can also begin to think better about local and regional
elections.¶ The left really likes that old saw: "Think Globally, Act
Locally." And then it rejects parties---even though [political parties
are, historically, forms]{.underline} that do that, [that actually
scale, that operate on multiple levels as organizations]{.underline}.¶
That we have a two-party system makes sense as an excuse why [people
haven't used left parties very well in the US, but that doesn't have to
be the case]{.underline}.¶ [And]{.underline} one more thing: [there is a
ton of sectarianism in the far left parties that exist]{.underline}.
Many still fight battles that go back to the twenties, thirties,
forties, fifties, and haven't let that go. [That has to
change]{.underline}. We don't need that kind of sectarian purity right
now.¶ CM: You ask the question, "How do we move from the inert mass to
organized activists?" You mention how you were at Occupy Wall Street;
you write about being there on 15 October 2011 as the massive crowd
filled New York's Times Square. And you mention this one young speaker,
and he addresses the crowd; they're deciding if they should move on to
Washington Square Park or not, because they need to go somewhere where
there are better facilities. You then quote the speaker saying, "We can
take this park. We can take this park tonight. We can also take this
park another night. Not everyone may be ready tonight. Each person has
to make their own autonomous decision. No one can decide for you. You
have to decide for yourself. Everyone is an autonomous individual."¶ Did
that kind of [individualism kill Occupy Wall Street from the
start]{.underline}?¶ JD: Yeah, I think so. A lot of times I blame the
[rhetorics of consensus and horizontalism]{.underline}, but both of
those [are rooted in an individualism that says politics must begin with
each individual, their interests, their experience, their positions, and
so on. As collectivity forms---which is not easy when everyone's
beginning from their individual position---what starts to happen is that
**people** start **look**ing **for how their exact experiences** and
interests **are not being recognized**]{.underline}.¶ I think that [the
left has given in too much to this assumption that politics begins with
an individual]{.underline}. That's a liberal assumption. [[Leftists,
historically, begin with the assumption that politics begins in
groups]{.mark}. And]{.underline} for the left in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, [the operative group is class. Class]{.underline}
is what [determines where our political interests come
from]{.underline}.¶ I try to do everything I can in the book [to
dismantle the assumption]{.underline} that politics, particularly [left
politics, should begin with the individual]{.underline}. Instead I want
people thinking about how [[the individual is a fiction, and a really
oppressive fiction]{.mark} at that]{.underline}. And one that's
actually, conveniently, falling apart.¶ CM: You write about Occupy Wall
Street having been an opening but having had no continuing momentum. You
mention that the party could add that needed momentum. That's one of the
things that parties can do. [The structure of the party can continue
momentum and keep the opening alive]{.underline}.¶ When you say that a
party could be a solution for a movement like Occupy, you don't mean the
Democratic Party, do you?¶ JD: I've got a lot of layers on this
question. My first answer is that no, I really mean the Communist Party.
My friends call this "Jodi's Fantasy Revolutionary Party" as a joke,
because [the kind of Communist Party I take as my model may not be real,
or may have only existed for a year and a half in Brooklyn in the
thirties]{.underline}. And I don't mean the real-existing Communist
Party in the US now, which still exists and basically endorses
Democrats.¶ My idea is to think in terms of how [[we can imagine the
Communist Party again as a force---what it could be like if all of our
left activist groups and small sectarian parties decided to come
together in a new radical left party]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ So no, I
don't envision the Democratic Party as being that. That's not at all
what I have in mind. [I'm thinking of a radical left party to which
elections are incidental]{.underline}. Elections might be means for
organizing, but [the goal isn't just being elected. [**The goal is
overthrowing capitalism**. The goal is **being able to build a communist
society as capitalism crumbles**]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Second, [it
could be the case---as a matter of tactics on the ground in particular
contexts---that working for a Democratic candidate might be
useful]{.underline}. It could be the case that trying to take over a
local Democratic committee in order to get communist/socialist/radical
left candidates elected could also be useful. [But]{.underline} I don't
see the goal as taking over the Democratic Party. [That's way too
limited a goal, and it's a goal that presupposes the continuation of the
system we have, rather than its overthrow]{.underline}.¶ CM: But how
difficult would it be for a Communist Party to emerge free of its past
associations with the Soviet Union? Can we even use the word "communist"
or is it impossibly taboo?¶ JD: We have to recognize that the right is
still scared of communism. That means the term is still powerful. That
means it still has the ability to instill fear in its enemies. I think
that's an argument for keeping the word "communism."¶ It's also amazing
that close to half of Iowa participants in the caucuses say that they
are socialist. Four or five years ago, people were saying socialism is
dead in the US. No one could even say the word. So I actually think
holding on to the word "communism" is useful not only because our
enemies are worried about communism, but also because it helps make the
socialists seem really, really mainstream, and that's good. We don't
want socialism to seem like something that only happens in Sweden. We
want it to seem like that's what America should have at a bare minimum.¶
One last thing about the history of communism: [every political ideology
that has infused a state form has done awful things]{.underline}. For
the most part, if people like the ideology, they either let the awful
things slide, or they use the ideology to criticize the awful things
that the state does. We can do the same thing with communism. It's
helpful to recognize that [the countries we understand to have
been]{.underline} ruled by [Communist]{.underline} Parties [were never
really communist---they didn't even claim to have achieved communism
themselves]{.underline}. We can say that [state socialism made these
mistakes, and in so doing was betraying communist ideals]{.underline}.¶
I don't think we need to abandon these terms or come up with new ones. I
think we need to use the power that they have. And people recognize
this, which is what makes it exciting.¶ CM: You write, "Some
contemporary crowd observers claim the crowd for democracy. They see in
the amassing of thousands a democratic insistence, a demand to be heard
and included. In the context of communicative capitalism, however, the
crowd exceeds democracy.¶ "In the 21st century, dominant nation-states
exercise power as democracies. They bomb and invade as democracies, 'for
democracy's sake.' International political bodies legitimize themselves
as democratic, as do the contradictory and tangled media practices of
communicative capitalism. When crowds amass in opposition, they pose
themselves against democratic practices, systems, and bodies. To claim
the crowd for democracy fails to register this change in the political
setting of the crowd."¶ So are crowds today, the protesters today,
opposed to democracy? Or are they opposed to the current state of, let's
say, representative democracy?¶ JD: Let's think about our basic
environment. By "our," now, I mean basically English-speaking people who
use the internet and are listening to the radio and live in societies
like the United States. In our environment, what we hear is that we live
in democracy. We hear this all the time. We hear that the network media
makes democratic exchange possible, that a free press is democracy, that
we've got elections and that's democracy.¶ [When crowds
amass]{.underline} in this setting, if they are just at a football game,
[it's not a political statement. Even at a march]{.underline} (fully
permitted) that's [registering opposition to the invasion of
Iraq]{.underline}, for example, [or concern about the
climate]{.underline}---all of those things are within the general
environment of "democracy," and [they don't oppose the system. They
don't register as opposition to the system. They're just saying that we
want our view on this or that issue to count]{.underline}.¶
[But]{.underline} the way that crowds have been amassing over the last
four or five years---Occupy Wall Street is one example, but the Red
Square debt movement in Canada is another; some of the more militant
strikes of nurses and teachers are too---has been to say, "Look, the
process that we have that's been called democratic? It is not. We want
to change that."¶ It's not that we are anti-democratic. It's that
democracy is too limiting a term to register our opposition. [We want
something more. We want actual equality]{.underline}. Democracy is too
limiting. The reason it's too limiting is we live in a context that
understands itself as "democratic." So democracy as a political claim,
in my language, can't "register the gap that the crowd is inscribing."
It can't register real division or opposition. Democracy is just more of
what we have.¶ CM: We are so dependent. We use social media so much, we
use Facebook so much, we use so many of these avenues of what you call
communicative capitalism so much. How can we oppose or reject this
system without hurting ourselves and our ability to communicate our
message to each other? Can we just go on strike? Can we become the
owners of the means of communicative production?¶ JD: One of the ways
that Marxism historically has understood the political problems faced by
workers is our total entrapment and embeddedness in the capitalist
system. What makes a strike so courageous is that workers are shooting
themselves in the foot. They're not earning their wage for a time, as a
way to put pressure on the capitalist owner of the workplace.¶ What does
that mean under communicative capitalism? Does it mean that we have to
shoot ourselves in the foot by completely extracting ourselves from all
of the instruments of communication? Or does it mean that we change our
attitude towards communication? Or does it mean that we develop our own
means of communication?¶ There's a whole range here. I'm not a Luddite.
I don't think the way we're going to bring down capitalism is by
quitting Facebook. I think that's a little bit absurd. I think what
makes more sense is to think of how [[we could use the tools we have to
bring down the master's house. We can consolidate our message
together]{.mark}. We can get a better sense of how many we are. We can
develop common modes of thinking. [We can distribute organizing
materials for the revolutionary party]{.mark}]{.underline}[.¶]{.mark} I
don't think that an extractive approach to our situation in
communicative media is the right one. I think it's got to be more
tactical. How do we use the tools we have, and how do we find ways to
seize the means of communication? This would mean the collectivization
of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and using those apparatuses. But that would
probably have to be day two of the revolution.¶ CM: Jodi, I've got one
last question for you, and it's the Question from Hell, the question we
might hate to ask, you might hate to answer, or our audience is going to
hate the response.¶ How much did the narrative that Occupy created, of
the 99% and the 1%, undermine a of collectivity? Because it doesn't
include everyone...¶ JD: [Division is crucial. Collectivity is never
everyone]{.underline}. What this narrative did was produce [the divided
collectivity that we need]{.underline}. It's great to [undermine
the]{.underline} ~~stupid~~ [myth of American unity]{.underline}, "The
country has to pull together" and all that crap. It's fantastic that
[Occupy Wall Street asserted collectivity through division. This is
class conflict. This says there is not a unified society. [Collectivity
is the collectivity of us against them. It produced the proper
collectivity: **an antagonistic one**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1NC \-\-- Historical Materalist Pedagogy

#### Voting negative to endorse a pedagogy of historical materialism. It's Key to creating a theory in order to spark the revolutions needed. 

\[Teresa **Ebert 2009**\] (THE TASK OF CULTURAL CRITIQUE, pp. 92-95,
Associate Professor of English, State University of New York at Albany,)
xx-xx-2009 //pyrex ultra

Unlike these rewritings, which reaffirm in a somewhat new language the
system of wage labor with only minor internal reforms, [materialist
critique aims at ending class rule. It goes beyond description and
explains the working of wage labor and the abstract structures that
cannot be experienced directly but underwrite it. Materialist critique
unpacks the philosophical and theoretical arguments that provide
concepts for legitimizing wage labor]{.underline} and marks the textual
representations that make it seem a normal part of life. In short,
**[[instead of focusing on micropractices]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(prison, gender, education, war[, **literature, and so
on**]{.underline}) in local and regional terms, [[**materialist critique
relates these practices to the macrostructures of capitalism** and
provides the knowledges necessary to put an end to
exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the center of these knowledges is
class critique. [Pedagogy of critique is a class critique of social
relations and the knowledges they produce]{.underline} . Its subject is
wage labor, not the body without organs . An exemplary lesson in
pedagogy of critique is provided by Marx, who concludes chapter 6 of
Capital, \" The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power, \" by addressing the
sphere within which wages are exchanged for labor power and the way this
exchange is represented in the legal, philosophical, and
representational apparatuses of capitalism as equal . He provides
knowledge of the structures of wage labor and the theoretical discourses
that sustain it. I have quoted this passage before and will refer to it
again and again. Here is the full version: We now know how the value
paid by the purchaser to the possessor of this peculiar commodity,
labour-power, is determined. The use-value which the former gets in
exchange, manifests itself only in the actual usufruct, in the
consumption of the labour-power. The money-owner buys everything
necessary for this purpose, such as raw material, in the market, and
pays for it at its full value . The consumption of labourpower is at one
and the same time the production of commodities and of surplus-value.
The consumption of labour-power is completed, as is the case of every
other commodity, outside the limits of the market or the sphere of
circulation. Accompanied by Mr. Moneybags and by the possessor of
labour-power, we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere,
where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men, and
follow them both into the hidden abode of production, on whose threshold
there stares us in the face \"No admittance except on business . \" Here
we shall see, not only how capital produces, but how capital is
produced. We shall at last force the secret of profit making. This
sphere that we are deserting, within whose boundaries the sale and
purchase of labour-power goes on, is in fact a very Eden of the innate
rights of man. There alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham.
Freedom, because both buyer and seller of a commodity, say of
labour-power, are constrained only by their own free will. They contract
as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is but the form in which
they give legal expression to their common will. Equality, because each
enters into relation with the other, as with a simple owner of
commodities, and they exchange equivalent for equivalent. Property,
because each disposes only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each
looks only to himself. The only force that brings them together and puts
them in relation with each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the
private interests of each. Each looks to himself only, and no one
troubles himself about the rest, and just because they do so, do they
all, in accordance with the pre-established harmony of things, or under
the auspices of an all-shrewd providence, work together to their mutual
advantage, for the common weal and in the interest of all. On leaving
this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities, which
furnishes the \"Free-trader vulgaris\" with his views and ideas, and
with the standard by which he judges a society based on capital and
wages, we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our
dramatis personae. He, who before was the money-owner, now strides in
front as capitalist; the possessor of labour-power follows as his
labourer. The one with an air of importance, smirking, intent on
business; the other, timid and holding back, like one who is bringing
his own hide to market and has nothing to expect but-a hiding.
[[Materialist critique is fundamental to]{.underline} a
[transformative]{.underline}]{.mark} feminist
[[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Through critique the subject develops
historical knowledges of the social totality: she acquires, in other
words, an understanding of how the existing social
institutions]{.underline} (motherhood, child care, love, paternity,
taxation, family, . . . and so on ) [are part of the social relations of
production, how they are located in exploitative relations of
difference, and how they can be changed. Materialist
critique]{.underline}, in other words, [is that knowledge practice that
historically situates the conditions of possibility of what empirically
exists under capitalist relations of class
difference]{.underline}-particularly the division of labor-and, more
important, points to what is suppressed by the empirically existing:
what could be, instead of what actually is. [Critique
indicates]{.underline}, in other words, [that what exists is not
necessarily real or true but only the actuality under wage labor. The
role of critique in pedagogy is exactly this: the production of
historical knowledges and class consciousness of the social relations,
knowledges that mark the transformability of existing social
arrangements and the possibility of a different social
organization]{.underline}\--one that is free from necessity. Quite
simply then, [the pedagogy of critique is a mode of social knowing that
inquires into what is not said, into the silences and the suppressed or
the missing]{.underline}, in order to unconceal operations of economic
and political power underlying the myriad concrete details and seemingly
disparate events and representations of our lives . [It shows how
apparently disconnected zones of culture are in fact linked by the
highly differentiated and dispersed operation of the systematic,
abstract logic]{.underline} of the exploitation of the division of labor
that informs all the practices of culture and society. It reveals how
seemingly unique concrete experiences are in fact the common effect of
social relations of production in wage labor capitalism. In sum,
materialist critique both disrupts that which represents itself as
natural and thus as inevitable and explains how it is materially
produced. [Critique, in other words, enables us to explain how social
differences,]{.underline} specifically gender, race, sexuality, and
class, [have been systematically produced and continue to operate within
regimes of exploitation-namely, the international division of labor in
global capitalism-so we can change them]{.underline}. It is the means
for producing politically effective and transformative knowledges . The
claim of affective pedagogy is that it sets the subject free by making
available to her or him the unruly force of pleasure and the
unrestrained flows of desire, thereby turning her or him into an
oppositional subject who cuts through established representations and
codings to find access to a deterritorialized subjectivity. But the
radicality of this self, at its most volatile moment, is the radicality
of the class politics of the ruling class, a class for whom the question
of poverty no longer exists. The only question left for it, as I have
already indicated, is the question of liberty as the freedom of desire.
Yet this is a liberty acquired at the expense of the poverty of others.
The pedagogy of critique engages these issues by situating itself not in
the space of the self, not in the space of desire, not in the space of
liberation, but in the revolutionary site of collectivity, need, and
emancipation. [[The core of the pedagogy of critique is that education
is **not simply** for enlightening the individual to see through **the
arbitrariness of signification and the violence of established
representations**]{.mark}. It recognizes that it is a historical
practice and, as such, it is always part of the larger forces of
production and relations of production. It understands that all
pedagogies are, in one way or the other, aimed at producing an efficient
labor force.]{.underline} Unlike the pedagogy of desire, the pedagogy of
critique does not simply teach that knowledge is another name for power,
nor does it marginalize knowledge as a detour of desire. [[It
acknowledges the fissures in social practices-including its own-but it
demonstrates that they are **historical and not textual or
epistemological**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It, therefore, does not retreat
into mysticism by declaring the task of teaching to be the teaching of
the impossible and, in doing so, legitimate the way things are. Instead,
the pedagogy of critique is a worldly teaching of the worldly.

**The Alternative is to a comprehensive measure to get rid the

Marx defined the separation of workers from control, ownership, or
unhindered access to the means of production as the differentia
specifica of capitalism, its defining core characteristic. **[An elite,
backed by a state]{.underline}** it disproportionately controls, **[uses
its ownership and control of]{.underline}** productive
**[wealth]{.underline}** **[to extract as much surplus as
possible]{.underline}** **[from]{.underline}** the
**[workers]{.underline}**. **[This extraction takes place
through]{.underline}** the **[social institutions]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** private property **[and markets]{.underline}**, but
**[these institutions are not]{.underline}** in and of **[themselves
coercive]{.underline}**. Private **[property becomes coercive when its
unequal ownership forces non-owners to become subservient and
exploitable]{.underline}**. Because Marx and other critics of capitalism
have extended their attacks to property, markets, and institutions such
as corporations, **[attention has been deflected from the core problem
of unequal control over and access to productive wealth]{.underline}**,
thereby **[impairing the development of an alternative vision that
directly addresses the issue of this inequality and that might gain
widespread popular support.]{.underline}** Just **[such a
vision]{.underline}** could **[entail two components]{.underline}**.
**[First,]{.underline}** suppose that **[workers]{.underline}**,
**[through their franchise]{.underline}**, **[vote into law that
government must guarantee everyone a job at a living wage and, where
appropriate, the training necessary to enter the regular job market.
This would eliminate welfare for the work-able while appealing to the
value that all should work]{.underline}**. **[Second,
taxes]{.underline}**, financing, **[regulation, and property
rights]{.underline}** **[are altered to privilege
democratic]{.underline}** worker-**[managed firms.]{.underline}**12 For
instance, **[privileging that property of productive units be held in
trusteeship]{.underline}**, much **[as is the case with private colleges
and universities in the United States]{.underline}**;
**[workers]{.underline}** in such productive units **[elect
democratically their managers with renewable term
limits]{.underline}**(as is not the case in these institutions);
productive units in each industry stand in market competition with each
other, as is the case with American higher education; **[progressive
income taxes, wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, and]{.underline}**
**[public spending are structured to limit inequality]{.underline}**;
**[progressive taxes on firm revenues are structured to limit productive
unit size]{.underline}**.13 Together, **[these reforms would eliminate
the core source of exploitation that Marx identified within
capitalism]{.underline}**---**[the separation of workers from control
and ready access to the means of production]{.underline}**. **[In such a
world, neither private property nor markets could be properly seen as
coercive, as instruments of exploitation]{.underline}**. Further, if job
tenure were instituted, the commodification of labor power would
generally be of short duration. **[The fact that institutions of higher
learning in the United States produce a worldclass product, making for a
highly successful export industry that is the envy of the world,
provides an impressive example of a highly dynamic industry that thrives
without being profit-driven and that is significantly
worker-controlled]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[there is no reason to
believe that an economy thus modeled would be any less dynamic and
self-transforming than current capitalism.]{.underline}** Indeed,
**[because of guaranteed employment and any necessary retraining,
combined with the fact that greater equality further democratizes and
raise educational levels]{.underline}** (Coady & Dizioli, 2017), it
should promise greater dynamism. If widely embraced and advocated by
progressives, **[such an alternative might become highly attractive
within the electorate.]{.underline}**14 **[The scourge of unemployment
and inadequate professional education would be eliminated. Democracy
would be extended from the political domain to work life such that no
one would receive directives from above from anyone whom those below had
not participated in selecting]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[such a vision
would not appear all that different from classical capitalism, retaining
its two principal institutions of property and markets without
concentrating power in the state.]{.underline}** Workers possess, in
principle, the political power to rewrite the social script. They only
need a convincingly attractive model to use it to reconfigure social
institutions in their favor

#### Revolutionary Marxism provides the only path to translate theory into praxis\-\--true social change is fragmented and messy\-\--only a ruthless criticism of all that exists can draw linkages between global movements and commit to a broader program of revolution.

Consider first the theoretical program set out in the letter to
Ruge.\[2\] Marx makes the case for [historically immanent
criticism]{.underline}, as opposed to abstract commentary or dogmatic
pronouncement. The young radical theorist describes his new outlook as
follows: it is precisely the advantage of the new trend that [we do not
dogmatically anticipate the world, but only want to find the new world
through criticism of the old one]{.underline}. Hitherto [philosophers
have had the solution of all riddles lying in their
writing-desks]{.underline}, and the stupid, exoteric world had only to
open its mouth for the roast pigeons of absolute knowledge to fly into
it. . . [But, if constructing the future and settling everything for all
times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to
accomplish at present]{.underline}: I am referring to [[**ruthless
criticism of all that exists**,]{.mark} ruthless both in the sense of
not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being
just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be]{.underline}.
[This anti-dogmatic protocol informs the rest of his life: t[o learn
from the **social dynamics of actual struggles** in order to
**articulate a real** (as opposed to **abstractly utopian**) **program
for revolutionary transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether it is
his changed views in the 1860s on Irish liberation, whose national
independence he came to support, or his reconsideration of the need to
dismantle the state in light of the Paris Commune of 1871, [**Marx** the
revolutionist is oriented on **[finding "the new world through
criticism]{.mark} of the old**]{.underline}." [The second vital
theme]{.underline} is his reminder that the radical project [is human
emancipation]{.underline}, not merely the overcoming of private
property. Since [the liberated society will be one of freedom and
radical democracy among dis-alienated people, it includes much more than
a change in the form of ownership: "the abolition of private property
and communism are by no means identical." If there is to be a future for
revolutionary socialism, part of it will lie in this focus on the
**content of social relations**, rather than the mere form of
property]{.underline}. [Equally important]{.underline}, thirdly, [is the
turn from philosophy to politics]{.underline}, a turn conducted in the
spirit of anti-dogmatism sketched above: Just as religion is a register
of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so [the political state is a
register of the practical struggles of mankind]{.underline}. . . .
**[[Therefore the critic not only can, but must deal with these
political questions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, [nothing prevents us
from making criticism of politics, participation in politics, and
therefore real struggles, the **starting point of our
criticism**]{.underline}, and from identifying our criticism with them.
[In that case we do not confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a
new principle]{.underline}: Here is the truth, kneel down before it! [We
develop new principles for the world out of the world's own principles.
We do not say to the world: Cease your struggles, they are foolish; we
will give you the true slogan of struggle. We merely show the world what
it is really fighting for]{.underline}. Here again we see the insistence
that [revolutionary politics cannot counterpose its preferred state of
things to reality. **There is no point in telling the world, "this is
how it should be."** Instead, **emancipatory politics begins with the
actual struggles that**, however elementally, **point beyond the
existing state of affairs**]{.underline}. It then [seeks to **deepen and
generalize those struggles**]{.underline}, [to **radicalize their most
liberatory elements**]{.underline}. But it never informs those engaged
in real struggles that "they are foolish." Rather than dismissing them,
[it seeks their **[inner deepening and development in revolutionary
directions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, Marx comes to the
dialectical interweaving of the future with the past: "It will become
evident that it is not a question of drawing a great mental dividing
line between past and future, but of realising the thoughts of the
past." Here is a non-linear conception of historical time, one in which
unrealized struggles for freedom are not dead and gone. Instead, they
are incomplete, awaiting realization in new circumstances. It is [in
this sense]{.underline} that [the **Haitian Revolution**, the **Paris
Commune**, the **October Revolution**, the global upheavals of **1968**
are **still alive**, the embodiments of dreams of liberation that
continue to inspire protagonists today]{.underline}. However, to realize
is not to repeat. [There is no "playbook]{.underline}" from Marx, Lenin
or anyone else [waiting to be applied to our age. To realize the thought
and struggles of the past is to actualize in new conditions, in
conditions that are in some respects more appropriate to the struggles
of the past. [This requires **attending to the changed circumstances in
which we operate**, **while nourishing past dreams of
liberation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And this too can only mean
nurturing the dialectical core of Marxism as **emancipatory theory and
practice**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the heart of Marx's political
thinking is dialectical criticism. And genuine criticism of this sort
can only ever be historical in his view. For, to tackle a political
problem is to work through its history---how it has come to be and how
it might come to be no more. And since our historical knowledge can only
ever be incomplete, it is---or ought to be---in a constant process of
development, amendment, and revision. Marx's commitment to revisiting
earlier problems and old formulations in the light of new experience is
an invaluable legacy for the left today. A New Scenario for World
Revolution But this approach was also decisive for Marx himself,
particularly after the defeated revolutions of 1848, as he reconsidered
the dynamics of world revolution. By the mid-1850s, it is clear that
Marx had moved toward the multilinear conception of history that is on
display in his Grundrisse notebooks of 1857. Kevin Anderson has
insightfully explored many of the intellectual sources for Marx's shift
from a unilinear (and Eurocentric) philosophy of history to this
multilinear (and increasingly anti-colonial) one.\[3\] Recently, Thierry
Drapeau has added to our understanding of this shift by highlighting the
influence on Marx during these years of the Chartist radical, Ernest
Jones. Drapeau notes Jones's fierce support for Irish independence (also
shared by Marx's daughter, Eleanor), for which the Chartist radical
spent two years in prison. He also reveals Jones's intransigent
opposition to British colonialism, particularly manifest in the verses
of his, "The New World, a Democratic Poem," which envisions a world
revolution that breaks out in India before spreading to Africa and then
the Americas. Drapeau traces compelling influences of Jones's
revolutionary anti-colonialism on Marx throughout the 1850s, during
which his politics became increasingly anti-colonial. Across these
years, Marx contributed about 30 articles to Jones's papers, often
co-writing them with his Chartist comrade.\[4\] Marx was learning, in
other words, from a leading representative of the most militant wing of
[the **British working-class movement**]{.underline}.\[5\] Through this
process, he was absorbing lessons from [**anti-colonial struggles** in
Ireland, India and China]{.underline}. In the coming decades he would
equally learn, as he himself acknowledged, from [the **movements of
African-American slaves** and of **Russian peasants and
workers**]{.underline}. In the process, he began to entertain scenarios
in which world revolution might begin outside the capitalist core,
though the working classes there would remain crucial for its
completion. Indeed, in Capital (1867), Marx slyly referenced [the
**Taiping Rebellion in China**]{.underline} from 1850-64 as just such an
event. "One may recall," he writes, "that China and the tables began to
dance when the rest of the world appeared to be standing still -- pour
encourager les autres."\[6\] [To encourage the others---this alludes to
the initiating role of revolutions outside the capitalist heartlands. In
this scenario, **world socialist revolution** becomes a **complex
process** involving **anti-colonial rebellions**, **peasant revolts**,
and **working-class uprisings**---all converging into a **global unitary
process**]{.underline}. In short, Marx was entertaining a new schema for
world revolution in which non-European social agents played a driving
role. [Marx's new perspectives on world revolution are testimony to his
allergy to confronting "the world in a doctrinaire way with a new
principle." They indicate his insistence on learning from the actual
social struggles of one's age. In an era in which the left is struggling
to reinvent itself in opposition to new configurations of global
capitalism and in the midst of new mass struggles, [**this is the Marx
we need**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC \-\-- The Party Solves

#### Only the Party can provide accountability mechanisms to correct unproductive tendencies, educate and mobilize communities, and connect struggles for liberation

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [[base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through **party** organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.mark}]{.underline} One of the crucial
insights of the base building movement is that [the current state of the
left in the United States is one in which revolution is not
**currently** possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular
support for socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda
has been extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [[The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this
insight]{.mark}. By building institutions which can meet people's needs,
we are able to concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the
oppressed relief from the horrific conditions of
capitalism.]{.underline} Base building strategy recognizes that actually
doing the work to serve the people does infinitely more to create a
socialist base of popular support than electing democratic socialist
candidates or holding endless political education classes can ever hope
to do. Dual power is about proving that we have something to offer the
oppressed. The question, of course, remains: once we have built a base
of popular support, what do we do next? [If it turns out that
establishing socialist institutions to meet people's needs does in fact
create sympathy towards the cause of communism, how can we mobilize that
base?]{.underline} Put simply: [**[in order to mobilize the base which
base builders hope to create, we need to have already done the work of
building a communist party.]{.underline}** [It is not enough to simply
meet peoples needs. Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power
in the name of communism.]{.underline}]{.mark} [We must refuse covert
front organizing and instead have a public face as a communist
party.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve the people
programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it clear that we
are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and are not
content simply with establishing endless dual power organizations. [We
must be clear that our strategy is revolutionary and in order to make
this clear we must adopt party organizing. By "party organizing" I mean
an organizational strategy which adopts the party model. Such organizing
focuses on building a party whose membership is formally unified around
a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making.]{.underline} [The party model creates internal methods for
**holding party members accountable**, unifying party member action
around democratically determined goals, and for educating party members
in communist theory and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization
utilizing the party model works to build dual power institutions while
simultaneously educating the communities they hope to serve.
[Organizations which adopt the party model focus on propagandizing
around the need for revolutionary socialism. They function as the
forefront of political organizing, empowering local communities to
theorize their liberation through communist theory while organizing
communities to literally fight for their liberation.]{.underline} A
party is not simply a group of individuals doing work together, but is a
formal organization unified in its fight against capitalism. Party
organizing has much to offer the base building movement. By working in a
unified party, base builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to
and informed by a unified national and international strategy. While the
most horrific manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique
form at the local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is
against a material base which functions not only at the national but at
the international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
**debate**, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from
democratic consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[[party organizing
allows for local organizations and individual organizers to be held
accountable for their actions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [It allows
criticism to function not as one independent group criticizing another
independent group, but rather as comrades with a formal organizational
unity working together to sharpen each others strategies and to help
correct chauvinist ideas and actions.]{.underline} In the context of the
socialist movement within the United States, such [accountability is
crucial.]{.underline} [As a movement which operates within a settler
colonial society, imperialist and colonial ideal frequently infect
leftist organizing. Creating formal unity and party procedure for
dealing with and correcting these ideas allows us to address these
consistent problems within American socialist organizing.]{.underline}
Having a formal party which unifies the various dual power projects
being undertaken at the local level also allows for base builders to not
simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into the membership of the
party as organizers themselves. The party model creates a means for
sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in a manner that allows
for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with newer organizers. It
also allows community members who have been served by dual power
projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming party members
and participating in the continued growth of base building strategy. It
ensures that there are formal processes for educating communities in
communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act and organize
in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must recognize
that the current state of the base building movement precludes the
possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing. [Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment]{.mark} into their organizations[, education of
community members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment
of armed and militant party cadres capable of]{.mark} defending dual
power institutions [from state terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dual power
institutions must be unified openly and transparently around these
organizations in order for them to operate as more than "red charities."
Serving the people means meeting their material needs while also
educating and propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and
organizing. [[The party model remains the most useful method for
achieving these ends]{.mark}.]{.underline} The use of the party model by
local organizations allows base builders to gain popular support, and
most importantly, to mobilize their base of popular support towards
revolutionary ends, not simply towards the construction of a parallel
economy which exists as an end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we
will see future unification of the various local base building
organizations into a national party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we
must push for party organizing at the local level. If local
organizations adopt party organizing, [it [ought to become clear
that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[a unified national party will have to be
the long term goal of the base building movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Many of the already existing organizations within the base building
movement already operate according to these principles. I do not mean to
suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to suggest that we ought to be
explicit about the need for party organizing and emphasize the
relationship between dual power and the party model. Doing so will make
it clear that the base building movement is not pursuing a cooperative
economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a revolutionary socialist
strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The long term details of base
building and dual power organizing will arise organically in response to
the conditions the movement finds itself operating within. [I hope that
I have put forward a useful contribution to the discussion about base
building organizing, and have dem]{.underline}

[Global neoliberalism is in turmoil]{.underline}. [Proven policies have
lost traction]{.underline}; established [political systems haemorrhage

sense of the age has degenerated into a farrago of clichés]{.underline}.
Even the steadiest political hands have lost their grip on the levers of
power, which, themselves, lack effectiveness. The [certainties that used
to hold neoliberalism together are melting into the air]{.underline}. Is
this an existential predicament or merely a passing disorientation?
Surely, [a decade-long economic crisis, the continuing decline of growth

moments]{.underline}; [however, such alarming repetition would warrant a
medical check-up]{.underline}. In what follows, I argue that [the
economic turmoil in global neoliberalism is now **morph**ing into a
political crisis that could engulf the entire system of
accumulation]{.underline}: [the beast is infirm, and it might become
fatal.]{.underline} A dysfunctional economic system Neoliberalism has
created unprecedentedly favourable conditions for capital accumulation
worldwide. They include the west's victory in the Cold War and the
reconstruction of US imperialism, the collapse of nationalist movements
and governments in the global south, the decline in the power of trade
unions, peasant movements, left parties and social movements, the
liberalisation of trade, finance and capital movements and the provision
of unparalleled support to accumulation by competing states, the
rollback of taxes on the rich and cutbacks on transfers and welfare
provision, and the ideological hegemony of a bogus but vociferous 'free
market' capitalism. At the same time, the availability of new
technologies has supported productivity growth and driven the
restructuring of accumulation, alongside significant increases in the
global labour force, not least with the integration of China and the
former Soviet Bloc into global capitalism. They have fostered a steep
concentration of power, income and wealth: [neoliberalism has created
new patterns of inequality and uneven and combined development, in which
unparalleled prosperity for certain groups]{.underline} (often
identified as financial or other elites or oligarchs, the top 1%, or the
top 0.01%) [coexist with severe poverty and new patterns of
exclusion.]{.underline} Instead of thriving on the basis of these
conditions, [accumulation in the core countries has been hampered by
falling rates of investment and GDP growth]{.underline}, [mounting
instability and **finance-driven crises**]{.underline}, [culminating in
the deepest and longest economic calamity since the Great
Depression]{.underline}. [Recoveries]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
also [become increasingly sluggish]{.underline}. [The current
crisis]{.underline} has already lasted nearly a decade, and it [shows
**no sign of resolution**]{.underline}. Its causes remain unaddressed,
and [the policies deployed to contain the cataclysm have created
**further imbalances**]{.underline}. In the meantime, [global warming
presses on]{.underline}, unchecked. Even the best-paid apologists of
capitalism now accept that [the world economy has been engulfed by a
**Great Stagnation with no end in sight**]{.underline}. These adverse
outcomes directly follow from the economic contradictions of
neoliberalism. The '[reforms']{.underline} [have dismantled pre-existing
systems of provision]{.underline}, [hampered the co-ordination of
economic activity]{.underline}, [created socially undesirable wage and
employment patterns]{.underline}, [precluded the use of industrial
policies to achieve socially determined priorities]{.underline}, [made
the balance of payments dependent on erratic flows of
capital]{.underline}, [and allowed the financial institutions to shift
resources from production into speculation almost at will]{.underline},
often under the guise of 'shareholder value'. Unsurprisingly,
[accumulation under neoliberalism tends to take the form of **bubbles**
**which inevitably collapse**]{.underline} with destructive
implications, [requiring]{.underline} expensive state-sponsored
[bailouts]{.underline}. A jammed political system The political project
of [neoliberalism]{.underline} includes an atrophied form of democracy
designed to [shield economic reproduction from political 'interference',
and where popular participation is limited to choosing between shades of
neoliberalism in a tightly regulated political market policed by a
vitriolic right-wing media]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the substantive
[choices about social provision]{.underline}, [the structure of
employment and the distribution of income are made
elsewhere]{.underline}. [Neoliberalism]{.underline} has eroded social
and economic structures in most countries; it has also imposed an almost
impermeable membrane between political power and the economic domain.
This has [drastically reduced the capacity of peoples and institutions
to resist and even to conceptualise alternatives]{.underline}. [Under
neoliberalism, 'there is no alternative' tends to become a
self-fulfilling reality, even when neoliberalism is patently
destructive, floundering, or failing]{.underline}. The isolation between
a brown politics and a dysfunctional economy derives, in part, from the
material structures of neoliberalism. For example, [the transnational
integration of production and finance creates the need for international
policy harmony through negotiation]{.underline}, [regulation,
conditionalities and competition between countries]{.underline}.
Inevitably, [they reduce the scope for national diversity and **erode**
the established **modalities of social reproduction**]{.underline}. At a
further remove, [neoliberalism]{.underline} embeds the logic of finance
into the country's institutional fabric, as it impo[ses specific
modalities of discipline on key social agents, with the workers at the
forefront, but also upon capital, the state and finance
itself.]{.underline} [These are accompanied by a growing intolerance to
all forms of dissent, from collective action to individual
privacy]{.underline}. Finally, [neoliberal democracy tends to splinter
the political sphere between a myriad of competing parties,]{.underline}
movements and NGOs with intransigently narrow horizons and lacking the
vision, means and ambition to transform society. [Their conflicting
agendas ensure a permanent political \[stagnation\]]{.underline}
~~paralysis~~ [that can be handled only by painful negotiations that,
ultimately, **secure the hegemony of conservative
interests**]{.underline}. [Neoliberal democracy has spawned **political
deadlock**]{.underline}, the disintegration of established forms of
representation, and a generalised sense of alienation. Many neoliberal
democracies are now engulfed in turmoil. [In the Eurozone
periphery]{.underline}, elected [governments]{.underline} [were replaced
by so-called non-party technocrats]{.underline} [ordered to
implement]{.underline}, with greater energy, [perverse strategies to
address the economic crisis]{.underline} (Greece, Italy). Later, elected
administrations advocating unconventional strategies were crushed
(Greece). A dour conformity reigns among near-stagnant economies. Then
the crisis of neoliberal politics reached the global periphery. There,
authoritarian governments have been installed by different means,
including more or less honest elections (Argentina, Hungary, India,
Poland), judicial-parliamentary coups (Brazil, Honduras, Paraguay), the
abuse of constitutional prerogatives (Turkey), and military coups
(Egypt, Thailand). [The malaise eventually reached the 'core'
countries]{.underline}. A hard-right Trump administration was elected in
the USA despite the 'superior experience' of Wall Street vassal Hillary
Clinton. [Japan drifts almost relentlessly towards
**ultra-nationalism**]{.underline}; Brexit won the popular vote in the
UK, despite ample disagreement about what the vote was for. In France,
Marine Le Pen flutters above the Élysée while a harsh national security
state trumps Liberté (Égalité lies in the dustbin, while Fraternité
drowned long ago). [Nativist populism thrives in Austria, Switzerland
and Scandinavia]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, [in the eastern
periphery of the EU]{.underline}, tinpot far-right politicians lead
rudderless societies against enemies weaker than themselves: waves of
dark-skinned refugees fleeing worse realities further south. The
lumpenisation of neoliberal politics and the rise of nationalist
authoritarianism The rise of [nationalist authoritarianism]{.underline}
is not a transient wobble on the march of neoliberal democracy towards
the 'end of history'. Quite the contrary: it [is the incubus springing
from the lumpenisation of neoliberal economies and societies through
several rounds of restructuring under the guise of
'adjustment',]{.underline} inflation control and the pursuit of
'competitiveness', culminating in the 'new normal' of long-term economic
stagnation punctuated by crises. In doing this, neoliberal restructuring
has also begotten the lumpenisation of politics. As [neoliberalism
hollowed out economies]{.underline} it also eroded the social structures
in most countries, with labour at the centre, [creating a large and
heterogeneous array of 'losers'.]{.underline} The condition of labour
has deteriorated for the informal workers, the traditional middle
classes, and almost everyone else. Millions of skilled jobs have
disappeared, and entire professions have either vanished or were
exported to cheaper shores. Employment opportunities in the public
sector shrunk, job stability retreated, and pay and conditions worsened
everywhere. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been deskilled
and, effectively, drowned into what Karl Marx described as the
lumpenproletariat and the reserve army of labour. The 'losers' include
informal workers with no realistic prospect of stable employment,
underemployed skilled workers, employees fearing the disappearance of
their jobs, indebted small business owners, bankrupt small farmers,
endangered middle managers, threatened small business owners, anxious
civil servants, panicky pensioners, and the remnants of erstwhile
privileged social strata bewailing their mounting debts and inability to
bequeath better circumstances to their offspring. [These 'losers' lack a
common culture or a sense of collectivity drawing upon shared material
circumstances; they also distrust political systems that seem to bypass
them.]{.underline} Heterogeneous, divided and disorganised, they are
unable to resist the continuing rollout of 'reforms'. Worse: just as the
lumpenproletariat is highly vulnerable to political capture by the
élite, [the losers in lumpenised neoliberal societies are prone to
capture by the political right.]{.underline} Under neoliberalism, left
parties, trade unions and mass organisations have imploded because of
social and economic change as well as repression[. The entire political
spectrum has shifted to the right, and the blockage of collective forms
of dissent has fed political apathy, anomie, and the sense that
politicians are there only for the taking]{.underline}. The 'losers'
tend to perceive the evacuation of democracy through the lens of
corruption and capture, in contrast to the sepia-tinted 'good old days'
of economic certainty and (limited) privileges, including jobs for life,
law and order, monochrome neighbours and obedient wives. They tend to
see today's political systems as serving primarily the rich (bankers,
tax dodgers, self-perpetuating political élites, foreign tycoons),
so-called 'privileged minorities' (constructed to mean women, selected
ethnic or national groups, or supposed sexual 'deviants'), and alien
hordes. Annoyingly, all of them seem to draw state support, while the
morally upright 'losers' find it impossible to make ends meet. Perhaps
even worse than these economic hardships is the erosion of their proud,
even if not elevated, social standing: it is difficult to understand
what has hit them, and why. These woes lead lumpenised groups of
'losers' to project their hopes and fears onto a universalist
(classless) ethics and reactionary political programmes drawing upon
'common sense'. These tend to be framed through the language of rights,
respect, taking back control, and the preservation of ancient
privileges, and fronted by 'strong' leaders who can 'get things done'.
These choices reflect the desperate search for a way to short-circuit a
logjammed political system and secure gains to those who have grown
tired of losing out, and lack a sense of security grounded on income,
assets, merit, citizenship, or anything else. Those agendas also express
their revulsion at slick politicians delivering, time and again,
convoluted excuses for inaction while the living conditions of the
majority continue to deteriorate. The implosion of post-war social
democracy can be directly related to these neoliberal pressures.
Mainstream conservative parties have shown greater resilience, both
because of their closer identification with neoliberal ideology and
policy practice, and because the right is used to deploying misleading
or unrealistic programmes and nationalist slogans. They are well
positioned to offer disgruntled voters a random menu of desirables,
regardless of contradiction even with neoliberalism itself. Those
programmes tend to be naïve, exclusionary, divisive, xenophobic, racist
and morally conservative. Yet, even those parties have been
triangulating towards an increasingly strident nationalism. Down their
necks breathes a new generation of proto- and neo-fascist movements
parading even more aggressive slogans. The far right has a proven
ability to mobilise on the basis of national, physical, religious or
gender identity, and it thrives best in conditions of anomie: current
conditions favour its continuing prosperity. The limits of nationalist
authoritarianism [Nationalist authoritarianism has emerged in response
to the economic contradictions of neoliberalism]{.underline}, [the
sclerosis of the political institutions regulating its metabolism and
the corrosion of its ideological foundations.]{.underline} It is,
however, limited, because [the aggregation of individual demands does
not support transformative programmes grounded upon material reality,
which are necessary to address the **structural problems of
accumulation** and **social reproduction** under late neoliberalism and
the ecological crisis]{.underline}. Even though authoritarian neoliberal
leaders are unlikely to deliver their key promises, this does not
prevent them from trying, or from achieving selected goals irrespective
of cost or consequence. The (unavoidable) [failures of nationalist
authoritarianism can lead social dissatisfaction under late
neoliberalism to remain unfocused]{.underline}, [feeding]{.underline}
unpredictable [explosions followed by rapid evaporation.]{.underline}
[These]{.underline} [cycles of revolt will be **destabilising** for the
**economic reproduction of neoliberalism** and for constitutional
politics]{.underline}. These grievances also tend to remain unresolved,
[fuelling **further waves of instability**]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} alarming political developments [have not evolved to
shield neoliberalism against the insurgency of an organised left
demanding political and economic democracy]{.underline}. Quite the
contrary: nationalist authoritarianism is the expression of the impotent
fury of a disorganised array of losers under neoliberalism, in
conditions of social disorganisation, global crisis, and accelerated
economic restructuring. Their [focus on attacking the weak]{.underline}
-- immigrants, refugees, the 'undeserving poor', the unjustifiably
'privileged' by state action and judicial activism -- [feeds retrograde
political programmes and poses the urgent need for **sustainable** and
**democratic left-wing alternatives**.]{.underline} [The economic and
political platforms against neoliberalism]{.underline}, and the
aspiration for democracy, [can be integrated through the demand for
**distributive** and **democratic economic policies**]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} demands [are]{.underline}, simultaneously,
**[fundamental conditions for a substantive democracy]{.underline}**,
and incompatible with nationalist authoritarianism. They also reflect
the notion that the most promising lever for challenging neoliberalism
is political, both because [neoliberalism's key vulnerabilities are in
the **political domain**]{.underline}, and because [politicised mass
movements are essential for progressive social and economic
change]{.underline}. [There is a race between the restoration of social
and political collectivity and barbarism]{.underline}. The winner will
take it all.

\[Macarena **Gómez-Barris 2017**\] (, Chair of the Department of Social
Science and Cultural Studies at Pratt Institute, *The Extractive Zone:
Social Ecologies and Decolonial Perspectives*, p. 133-137) xx-xx-2017
//pyrex ultra

I have addressed visual and embodied knowledges, intellectual
genealogies, and trans-feminist, Indigenous, and networked formations
that exceed, escape, mediate, and invert the extractive view. And I have
discussed how [the extractive view refers to state and corporate logics
that map territories as commodities rather than perceive the
proliferation of life and activities that make up the human and nonhuman
planetary]{.underline}. The geographies we have explored emerge out of
specific regions within the Américas, placing South American living
social ecologies at my study's center. I have focused on majority
Indigenous territories but have also referenced Afro-descended
ontologies, for how they perceive otherwise and contain the capacity to
erode the extractive gaze, even as the figure of the African slave
within the mita system in the South American extractive zone is often
disappeared, even from radical histories. [These modes of seeing and
critiquing urge a reconsideration of the submerged, and of the
heterogeneity that resides within the matrix of
coloniality]{.underline}. Throughout the introduction and the volume's
five chapters, I put into view other modes of perception that organize
time, space, sociality, and the cosmos. These include [Mapuche
visuality, Andean phenomenology, anarchist-feminist Indigenous analysis,
Yasuní cooperatives, and a fish-eye episteme]{.underline}. Such fecund
sites and methods [constitute inverted visualities, and reversals of
power through vernacular practices that dynamically shift the meaning of
Enlightenment and Western forms of thought, feeling, and
being]{.underline}. What [these proposals share is a
decolonial]{.underline}, and [anti-authoritarian vision; they project
the potential of future planetary inhabitance, beyond]{.underline} the
"rise of slime," as oceanographer Jeremy Jackson has coined [impending
ecological disaster.1 As the diametric opposite of the "rise of slime"
that is born from the homogenizing force of decimation, the muck that I
refer to]{.underline} in the preface, and throughout my study, [is
animated by the intangibility of biodiverse life forms, the poiesis of
difference, the untaming of the other, refusals and reversals that
emerge out of the extractive zone]{.underline}. I used the term
"intangibility" to refer to the thickness and heterogeneity of life
residing within global geographies that require careful practices of
conservation against the acceleration of racialized and colonial
capitalism. [The multiplicity of life forms found within spaces of the
extractive zone complicate the relation between self and other, nature
and culture, human and the nonhuman, and exist beyond the grasp of the
monocultural and extractive divide]{.underline}. Beneath the surface,
where digital technology scans for earthly resources, and [outside of
the conversion of nature into monetary exchange, something else
emerges]{.underline}. Namely, [the dream of "another world" is not
merely a future-oriented utopia but it is already in motion, teeming
with the alternatives we desire. Seeing the muck, dwelling in it, and
finding ways to make it visible become important antidotes as
present-past ways to recognize and strengthen these
alternatives.]{.underline} Over the last decade, I have shared
experiences with activists, communities, and scholars throughout South
America, spending long days within regional geographies consumed by the
histories and contradictions of coloniality. Being in relation to the
spaces I study, living there off and on over a decade, and having the
privilege of moving within them has been central to crafting a
decolonial queer episteme and method, a porous form of knowledge
production that listens to and takes in social worlds to write about
them with a measure of epistemological freedom without having to make
objective claims. Paying attention to sex/gender difference as its own
source of enlivenment and dispossession is part of this perception.
Given the dangers of reproducing coloniality, I recognize the ethical
significance of treading lightly, but without situated site work, I
would not have seen what emerges, grows, adapts within and refuses the
extractive zone. My viewpoint, I hope, has been capacious enough not to
reify, fix, or fully describe or comprehend the myriad forms of life and
potentialities I have encountered. Instead of emphasizing an analysis of
equivalence that conventionally compares regions, or tracing
disciplinary tracks of evidence, I have focused instead on the submerged
perspectives and social ecologies that reside within the extractive
zone, taking my cues from the blurring of an ecotone's boundaries, or
from the fish that see below the river's surface, or from the memory of
the pehuen trees that have witnessed the duration of colonial violence.
Therefore, my standpoint does not aim to quell the histories of the
violence upon Indigenous peoples and territories within the hemisphere,
and the specific forms of objectification, commodification, and
"transits of Empire," as Jodi Byrd terms it, that intercede and overcome
the peoples and geographies that I have written about. Instead, I have
attended to the complexities of inhabiting the extractive zone by
finding new concepts and language that propel our understanding of how
the leveling of capitalism is negotiated and resisted, refused, and
forestalled. Perceiving through the extractive divide has changed me by
allowing for dreams, imaginaries, and forms of living as forcefully and
continually emergent. In the process of researching and writing this
book, my perspective on how to challenge extractive capitalism has
shifted. Indigenous scholars focusing on the United States and Canada
have analyzed the limitations of legal recognition, critiquing the law's
liberal impulse, and the constrained ability to affect change through
the highly codified system of representation that condones private
property. As Joanne Barker and Glen Coulthard rightly argue, we must
move beyond the recognition paradigm. [We must]{.underline} also
[broaden our perspective on recognition beyond the law and
nation-state]{.underline}, beyond [liberal multiculturalism,
and]{.underline} ultimately beyond [the settler colonial and
occupational state of extractive capitalism]{.underline}.2 There are
clear proposals here. [Listening to and learning from the Andean world's
phenomenological orientation, and Indigenous land-based cosmologies more
broadly, we might recognize Pachamama as an important source of a
collective future rather than a delimited regional
worldview]{.underline}. In other words, we might perceive and enact how
Pachamama does not just belong to Andean ways but can be somehow
recognizable as our own Earth Being while not giving into the
surface-level viewpoints of the New Age. The toxifying condition of
commodity capitalism is precisely about the appropriative logics of
Indigenous technologies, aesthetics, worldviews. [Reckoning with
Indigenous epistemes]{.underline}, whether land-based, through
intellectual genealogies, the remembering of colonial histories, or
through cultural production, [we might move beyond coloniality and
extinction. This submerged planetary perspective invites us into another
realm of perception that leaves the extractive zone behind. The promise
of new "progressive" states in Latin America has unfortunately
distracted us with their institutionalization of buen vivir politics.
Extractive states crack down on Indigenous and ecological politics while
denying the gravity of theft and contamination, as Indigenous and
Afro-descendent communities acutely suffer through increased cancer
rates, expanded dispossession, and life's reduction]{.underline}. This
is not to say that progress has not been made on integrating Indigenous
and African-based viewpoints into historically Eurocentric
nation-states. However, [as anarcho-Indigenous feminist critique
presciently illuminates, the colonial state cannot be
remade.]{.underline} My analysis of conservation has also been radically
altered by being in proximity to these locations. [Against
militarization and state intrusion, radical conservation is already
being carried out by land defenders and through alternatives to late
capitalism,]{.underline} but only [alongside multidirectional social
movements such as YASunidos in Ecuador and asoquimbo and Rios Vivos in
Colombia. These movements understand the web of interdependence rather
than feed into the matrix of coloniality.]{.underline} Like these
trans-regional and intersectional assemblages, we might repel the
dominant capitalist logic that presumes that finite natural resources
are already depleted. Such pessimism subsumes us even further into the
clutches of accelerated capitalism's no future, facilitating extraction,
waste, and the occlusion of differential pain within the extractive
zone. Yet, we can still choose to collectively shift our attention. We
can lower our view to where the wild boars make their mushy homes, and
watch the ant cutters on their path within the forest's cycles of
entropy. Similarly, we can shift perspective by raising our view, and
see from a bird's-eye view--- or a satellite's view---all that reaches
to perceive space and temporality with attention, precision, attunement.
The artistic work of Francisco Huichaqueo and Carolina Caycedo has shown
us this elsewhere, this other side of the colonial divide, this
possibility of perceiving and sensing complexly. [In response
to]{.underline} Ruth Wilson Gilmore's always present, provocative, and
necessary question "[What is to be done?,"]{.underline}3 I have shown
that in these extractive South American regions, [there is already so
much being done that what we require is a practice of listening to and
then amplifying present-future analyses, responses, and
proposals]{.underline}. As I mentioned in the intro duction, we must
also listen. For instance[, the 2005 ¡Escucha Winka! statement written
by three Mapuche historians]{.underline}, José Millalén, Pablo Marimán,
Rodrigo Levil, [and the Mapuche sociologist]{.underline}, Sergio
Caniuqueo[, is a blueprint for autonomous Indigenous governance that
dually frustrates assimilative state management and the exigencies of a
capitalist growth model]{.underline}. Collectively, [these authors find
non-normative ways to sovereignly negotiate the thickets of neoliberal
governmentality, the monocultural condition of extraction, and the
prevalent extinction paradigm of international
environmentalism.]{.underline} Specifically, [the term winka refers to
the Mapudungun word for a nonindigenous subject]{.underline}, a
mestiza/o, potentially a gringa/o, and potentially you and me. ¡Escucha
Winka! literally translates to, "Listen up, white man!" [Mapuche writers
hail non-Mapuche subjects with the command to ¡Escucha! not as an
insulting interpellation]{.underline}, or as a mere critique of
present-past colonialism[. Rather, the effort to speak directly to the
winka is, most generatively, a patient call for a listening practice
that hovers at the edge of capitalism's noise, a whispered suggestion to
settlers that enables a louder message: "Listen, winka, because
occupying Indigenous territories is not good for you,
either.]{.underline}" This kind of Indigenous autonomous thought
sharpens the edge of the liberal endgame of multiculturalism and state
recognition. [Mapuche autonomous thinking rescrambles how we understand
progress, and reassigns meaning away from the devaluing of life at the
core of capitalism.]{.underline}

#### A Feminist Analysis is key to dismantle gendered violence through war

Why a women's gate? **[There is a long tradition of women organising
against the Bomb.]{.underline}** On the 1 March 1954 the United States
tested a nuclear weapon on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Japanese
fisher­men in their boat The Lucky Dragon, were caught in the radioactive
fallout. The inci­dent caused a wave of anti-nuclear acti­vism in Japan.
It began in Suginami, an electoral district of Tokyo. And it was main­ly
the women of Suginami neighbourhood who organized a petition for the ban
on nuclear weapons that raised just short of 30 million signatures in
two months. Those [French and US atmospheric nuclear tests also sparked
off another response, at the opposite end of the Paci­fic
Ocean]{.underline}: the movement for a Nuclear Free and Independent
Pacific[. An im­portant part of that was WNFIP -- Women for a Nuclear
Free and Independent Pacific. One reason women organised was because so
many of the children to which they gave birth after they were irradiated
by the nuclear tests had terrible birth defects.]{.underline} Later, in
the 1980s, [there was a huge movement of women in the UK against the
introduction here of US cruise and Per­shing nuclear
missiles.]{.underline} British peace move­ment readers will hardly need
reminding -- it centred on the RAF base at Greenham Common, where a
substantial arsenal of nuclear missiles was to be stationed. One day a
group of women set out from Cardiff in Wales and walked a hundred miles
to Greenham. When they arrived, on 5 Sep­tember 1981, four of them
chained them­selves to the fence and demanded a tele­vised debate with the
Secretary of State for Defence. This was the start of a spon­taneous
women's peace camp that soon had more than a hundred women living under
plastic and canvas, and thousands more coming at weekends from Green­ham
support groups that sprang up around the country. [On 12 December 1982
an estimated 30,000 women came to protest at Greenham Common, enough to
completely 'embrace the base' around its 14 kilometre fence. The camp
persisted till after the last missile had been returned to the USA in
1991. Greenham was a place where women made links with each other
worldwide around the nuclear issue. One of the women who came to
Greenham from Australia was Zohl de Ishtar, who had helped organize, and
has since written books about, Wo­men for a Nuclear Free and Independent
Pacific.]{.underline} The women resisting the arrival in Britain of
cruise missiles were in touch with others organizing against the same
weapon at Comiso in Sicily, Pine Gap in Australia and Seneca Falls, New
York. [Women who camped at Greenham went on to contribute hugely to
anti-nuclear work elsewhere. To name just three: Helen John founded
another a women's peace camp in 1993 at the missile-war­ning station at
Menwith Hill; Rebecca Johnson (who was 'gate support' per­son at the
women's gate on 15 Febru­ary) set up the Acronym Institute for
Disar­mament Diplomacy and travels conti­nuous­ly worldwide as a respected
specialist in nuclear weapons control. She was one of the founders of
the Aldermaston Women's Peace Camp in 1985. And Sian Jones, who later
helped mobilize the Aldermaston Women's Peace Campaign, has been
tracking and publicizing developments at the Atomic Weapons
Establishment for almost two decades. What is it that brings women out
as women against nuclear weapons, or against war, or **against
militarism** itself?]{.underline} [My work is **research**]{.underline}.
For twelve years now I have been [researching feminist antiwar
organizing. In the course of fact-finding in a score of countries I have
found that wo­men usually have three reasons for orga­nising separately as
women. The first is that women have an experience of mili­tarism and war
that is specific to their gender.]{.underline} Birthing babies with
birth defects, as did the Pacific women, is just one of these
experiences. Rape of women on an epidemic scale, as in the Bosnian war
and in the Congo and Sudan now -- that is another. [Then again, women
often feel special anger about military expenditure because it reduces
the budget available for the public and social services on which so many
women, who do the majority of domestic, health and care work, paid and
unpaid, specially depend. Women orga­nise as women to make women's
parti­cular experience in peace and war visible and understood. The
second reason behind 'women-only' antiwar activism is simply for
effec­tiveness, for women to be able to exercise choice. Often in mixed
groups it is men who **take a lead**. They may not mean to dominate, but
somehow their voices carry more weight. It is not the case in all
groups. There are some in the peace mo­vement that are very careful in
the way they conduct gender relations. But some women in the
not-so-wonderful groups sometimes get to think, they have told me, 'I
can't waste my time with this "double militancy" -- having to struggle
in the group in order to struggle out there in the world.]{.underline}
Let's do it on our own.' That makes wo­men's voices more audible, and
women can make choices, choose styles and strategies of organization and
action, that feel comfortable to them as women, and are different from
those of some mixed groups. [So -- first, getting women's experience
visible; second, doing things in a particular way. But there is a third
reason some women choose to organize as women, and it may be more
significant than the other two. It is because there is a feminist
analysis of militarism and war that is lacking in the thinking of the
mainstream movement. Militarism and war are products of systems of
power. The main two war-sustaining systems are (1) capitalism -- the
class power of money and property; and (2) **nationalism** -- the racist
power of the state, white rule, ethnic hatred. Both are systems of
oppression and exploita­tion and are thus essentially, necessarily,
**violent**. The antiwar movement mobilizes against both those **systems
of power**. Feminists say, 'Hold on...there's another system of power
intertwined with those two. It too is oppressive, exploitative and
violent. It too predisposes society to militarism and war. It's called
**patriarchy\'**. What feminists mean by patriarchy is the
millennia-old, world-wide, almost universal form of gender order in
which men exercise power over women, and which fosters a kind of
masculinity that thrives on domination and force. So, some women say,
the antiwar move­ment needs to address, yes, capitalist exploi­tation,
and, yes, racist, nationalist impulses, but also systemic male power.
All three, nothing less. Struggle for a transformation of gender
relations has to be recognized as peace work. In our very own antiwar,
antimilitarist and peace movements, just as we try not to behave like
little capitalists, and just as we do not tolerate racism, so we should
not tolerate sexism. Our activism has to reflect the world we want to
create.]{.underline} Totally. Prefigurative struggle, it's called.
Coherencia entre fines y medios. I want to end by stressing that we are
not talking here about men and women as such, let alone about individual
men and women. [We are talking about cultures -- cultures that thrive
and multiply everywhere from bank boardrooms, to the pub on a Saturday
night, from TV commercials to computer games, cultures that set up
masculinity and femininity as caricatures of human 'being', that create
a whole symbolic system in which particular qualities are ascribed to
masculinity, and given supremacy. What is a 'real man'? Being
authoritative, combative, defended, controlling, hard, always ready to
use violence to defend honour. It is clear that these qualities are
deeply implicated in militarism and war. And women make a connection
here: actual men either find the courage to refuse this model or they
act it out. And when they act it out, they do so not only in the
military, but also in everyday life, in ways that are very costly to
women. So women can hardly avoid seeing violence as a continuum, one
that stretches from the school playground, bedroom and back street to
the battlefield, from their own bodies to the body politic. It may be
that our movement is something more than an antiwar movement, more even
than a peace movement. It may be a movement for a nonviolent
world.]{.underline} To come back to nuclear weapons ... One day in the
summer of 2005, two women came to Stockholm to address a meeting of the
presti­gious Weapons of Mass Destruction Commis­sion. It was chaired by
Hans Blix. He had invited them to speak on 'the relevance of gender for
eliminating weapons of mass destruction'. This whole idea was no doubt
surprising to most members of the Commission. But these women were well
respected. Carol Cohn was Director of the Boston Consortium on Gender,
Security and Human Rights and a senior scholar at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy. Felicity Hill was Greenpeace International political
adviser on nuclear and disarmament issues, and had been a security
adviser at UNIFEM and director of the WILPF office in New York. They
received a careful hearing. And they spoke about how ideas about gender
-- what is deemed masculine or femi­nine, powerful or impotent, affect
our efforts towards halting the proliferation of WMD. They drew on
detailed research. For instance, insider research that revealed the
laddish, boys'-own, culture of a certain nuclear policy institute.
Research that had analysed and revealed how the fear of being seen as
'soft' or 'wimpish' had influenced actual political decisions to go to
war in recent times. They also cited research that shows the tight link
between masculine identity, men's sense of self, and the ownership of a
gun (or a knife or a pit-bull terrier). The man-gun affinity is
something that has been found in many countries to hinder demobilization
after war. The two women told the Commissioners: [There's now general
recognition that there are significant gender dimensions to the
posses­sion of small arms and light weapons. It would be naïve to assume
that this association suddenly becomes meaningless when we're talking
about larger, more massively destructive weapons. And it's more naïve
still to think it doesn't matter.]{.underline} So, at the Women's Gate
during the Big Blockade of the AWE nuclear weapons factory on 15
February 2010 women were holding banners and placards with messages
similar to those I have heard spoken by Suzuyo Takazato in Japan, by Kim
Sook-Im in Korea amd Stasa Zajovic in Serbia. They might have been
written by women in countries as far apart as Colombia and Spain, India
and the Philippines. They said[: 'Spend money on services not nuclear
wea­pons', 'Security for women? Disarm masculinity. Disarm militaries',
and 'No fists, no knives, no guns, no bombs -- no to all
violence'.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to reject the affirmative and inject a pedagogy of non-violence as a resistive model to militaristic technologies -- this educational practice deconstructs the violent ideology of the aff and allows us to conceptualize peace

This theology of neoliberalism maintains a sense of rationalism
precisely because it looks to reason rather than experience as the
foundation of certainty in knowledge. As Neil Brenner and Nik Theodore
(2002: 353) argue, 'the manifold disjunctures that have accompanied the
worldwide imposition of neoliberalism between ideology and practice;
doctrine and reality; vision and consequence are not merely accidental
side effects of this disciplinary project. Rather, they are among its
most essential features.' In other words[, the effects of
neoliberalization (poverty, inequality, and mythic violence) are
ignored]{.underline} (Springer, 2008), and [in their place a commonsense
utopianism is fabricated]{.underline} (Bourdieu, 1998). And [so we stand
at 'the end of history']{.underline} (Fukuyama, 1992), or at least so we
are told, wherein the monotheistic imperative of [one God gives way to
one market and one globe]{.underline}. Yet [the certainty of such
absolutist spatio-temporality is in every respect chimerical. Space and
time are always becoming, invariably under construction. The future is
open]{.underline}, and to suggest otherwise is to conceptualize space as
a vast lacuna. [There are always new stories yet to be
told]{.underline}, new connections yet to be made, new contestations yet
to erupt, and [new imaginings yet to blossom]{.underline} (Massey,
2005). As Said (1993: 7) argued, 'Just as none of us is outside or
beyond geography, [none of us is completely free from the struggle over
geography. That struggle]{.underline} is complex and interesting because
it [is not only about soldiers and cannons but also about
ideas,]{.underline} about forms, about [images and imaginings'. This
sentiment applies]{.underline} [as much to]{.underline} the geographies
of [neoliberalism as it does to violent geographies]{.underline}. If so
[much of the world's violence is made possible through virulent
imaginings]{.underline}, then perhaps [the first step towards peace is a
collective imagining of nonviolence]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, this is
an exercise made possible through culture via human agency because,
'\[i\]f violence 'has meaning', then those meanings can be challenged'
(Stanko, 2003: 13). Yet conceiving peace is every bit as much a
geographic project. Violence sits in places in a very material sense, we
experience the world though our emplacement in it, where violence offers
no exception to this cardinal rule of embodiment. But there is no
predetermined plot to the stories-so-far of space, the horizons of place
are forever mercurial, and geographies can always be re-imagined.
Geography is not destiny any more than culture is, and as such the
possibility of [violence being bound in place is only accomplished
through the fearful and malicious imaginings of circulating
discourses]{.underline}. Put differently, it is the [performative
effects of Orientalism and other forms of malevolent
knowledge]{.underline} that [allow violence to curl up and make itself
comfortable in particular places.]{.underline} What can emerge from such
understandings is a 'principled refusal to exclude others from the
sphere of the human' and an appreciation of how 'violence compresses the
sometimes forbiddingly abstract spaces of geopolitics and geo-economics
into the intimacies of everyday life and the innermost recesses of the
human body' (Gregory & Pred, 2007: 6). Violence is not the exclusive
preserve of 'the Other' rooted in the supposed determinism of either
biology or culture; it populates the central structures of all
societies. [The capacity for violence exists within the entirety of
humanity, but so too does its opposite, the rejection of violence. There
are choices to be made each moment of every day, and to imagine peace is
to actively refuse the exploitative structures, virulent ideologies, and
geographies of death that cultivate and are sown by violence. This
emancipatory potential entails challenging the discourses that support
mythic violence through a critical negation of the circuits it promotes,
and nonviolent engagement in the sites e both material and abstract e
that it seeks to subjugate]{.underline}. It requires a deep and
committed sense of 'Self'- reflection to be able to recognize the
circuitous pathways of violence when it becomes banal, systematic, and
symbolic. And it involves the articulation of new imaginative
geographies rooted not in the 'architectures of enmity' (Gregory,
2004a), but in the foundations of mutual admiration, respect, and an
introspective sense of humility. By doing so, [we engage in a politics
that reclaims the somatic as a space to be nurtured,]{.underline}
reproduces familiar and not so familiar geographies [through networks of
solidarity built on genuine compassion]{.underline}, and rewrites local
constellations of experience with the poetics of peace.

[As to the efficacy of individual action, individuals can make a
difference -- and not only such larger-than-life figures as Mother
Teresa or Martin Luther King, Jr. In a democracy, individuals count --
each of us. Moreover, although powerlessness is a self-fulfilling
prophecy, so is empowerment. When people are convinced that they are
helpless and their behavior is insignificant, in fact they will behave
helplessly and without significance. ¶ But the opposite can also be
true.]{.underline} "It is within our power," wrote¶ Thomas Paine more
than 200 years ago, "to begin the world anew." [To some degree,¶ that is
what happened when a country was formed based on the principles of
democracy and sell-government.]{.underline} And the prospect of major,
transformative change---not¶ only within individuals but in their
society as well---is no less true in our time than it¶ was in his.
Interestingly, Edmund Burke, writing at about the same time as Paine
but¶ espousing a very different view of what the world should be like,
noted that "the only¶ thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for
good men to do nothing."¶ The Cold War is over, and nuclear¶ weapons are
becoming increasingly delegitimized in the minds of some leaders [In
addition, there is some reason for optimism.]{.underline} and¶ citizens
alike. War itself may be headed in a similar direction. Next might come
the¶ elimination of major violent conflicts, the further isolation of
terrorism and terrorists, and, eventually, [progress toward positive
peace. For this process to continue]{.underline} (to some degree it has
already begun), at least three [things are needed: (1) belief in the
possibility of peace, (2) belief in one's personal power and efficacy,
and (3) motivation to proceed,]{.underline} whether individually or
collectively. We emphasize the first of these.¶ [A primary block to the
establishment of peace is not so much the actual difficulty of achieving
it but rather the feeling that it is impossible, the inability or¶
refusal of many people to imagine peace as a realistic prospect. Before
anything can¶ be done, it must first be imagined.¶]{.underline}
Athletics coaches, business leaders, and many actors on the world stage
have come to recognize the value of visualization: imagining one's body
perfectly coordinated during a gymnastics exercise, envisioning oneself
achieving a new sales record, and so forth. Subtly, [unconsciously, the
mind can be essentially "reprogrammed," releasing new potentials and
facilitating the accomplishment of things¶ previously thought out of
reach. Personal transformation does occur, but only after people believe
in the possibility of themselves changing, have a positive image of the¶
kind of change they desire, and are positively reinforced by others
seeking to¶ accomplish similar goals.]{.underline}

### Conflict -\> Vio

#### The aff's theorization of conflict is trapped in a neoliberal frame that naturalizes structural violence and environmental destruction.

IRT = international relations theory

\[Ruben **Gonzalez-Vicente 18**\] (Lecturer at Universiteit Leiden, The
liberal peace fallacy: violent neoliberalism and the temporal and
spatial traps of state-based approaches to peace, Territory, Politics,
Governance, Taylor & Francis) 12-06-2018 //pyrex ultra

THE MULTIPLE SCALES OF VIOLENT NEOLIBERALISM How are we then to explain
the inability of mainstream liberal approaches to predict what seems to
be a logical turn -- in the form of a societal defence or Polanyian
'counter movement' versus the inequalities, risks and vulnerabilities
fomented by the world market? Much of [[the problem lies within **IRT's
scalar limitations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which we can explore by
focusing on [the disjunction between the interstate scale and the
diversity of political economic processes and social
conflict]{.underline} occurring at other scales. [This disjunction
is]{.underline} with no doubt [closely related to IRT's development and
consolidation in the post-Second World War years, a period characterized
by]{.underline} particular patterns of growth of national development,
marked ideological preferences and **[[methodological
nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- although at that point debates on
structural violence and positive peace already existed in the margins of
the field of IR (Gleditsch, Nordkvelle, & Strand, 2014). These all
resulted in what John Agnew famously described as [IRT's 'territorial
trap', a fixation with the interstate scale and the **assumption** that
**states are containers of societies**, with politics played in a
**domestic/ foreign binary**]{.underline} (Agnew, 1994). Below, I expand
on this notion to discuss how [[**violence or risk have been rescaled**
in the neoliberal era from the interstate realm and into the individual
one]{.mark}, with societies taking on the costs of a competitive market
integration that has allowed for]{.underline} -- at least temporarily --
[relatively convivial relations between key states]{.underline} ([and
the elites who control them]{.underline}) [mediating the **global
economic architecture**]{.underline} (on risk, see also Beck, 1999).
[IRT's territorial trap remains **ubiquitous**]{.underline}. Despite
decades of powerful critiques that have presented the post-Westphalian
nation-state as a never fully realized political moment and a site of
social conflict (Agnew, 1994; Mitchell, 1991), [s[tates remain an
**ontological fixation** at the **core of IRT**. This is even more so
the case when it comes to the **understanding of conflict and
peace**.]{.mark} Whereas]{.underline} the field of [IR is]{.underline}
today [increasingly]{.underline} open to [accepting 'non-traditional'
security threats such as organized crime, terrorism or epidemics, these
are]{.underline} to a great degree **[studied as anomalies in a
state-based system]{.underline}**, and considered only inasmuch as they
pose a threat to state order. [Typologies of war]{.underline} such as
the Correlates of War (COW) Data Sets [accept non-state entities
as]{.underline} potential [actors]{.underline} of conflict. [However,
these are]{.underline} narrowly [defined as 'nonterritorial
entities]{.underline} or non-state armed groups' that are [not formally
accepted as members of the interstate system]{.underline} but which must
contest the power of a state or at least represent a violent challenge
to state or state-like entities in order to be agents of conflict (COW
Wars v. 4.0, 2014). [According to this understanding, peace is **not
only negatively constructed** as the absence of violence]{.underline}
(Williams & McConnell, 2011, p. 928), [but in particular **[as the
absence of violence explicitly directed at the state or at gaining
control of a state]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [This **monoscalar
conceptualization** of peace and conflict **pervades liberal IRT**, too,
which considers the state the **key actor** in international relations,
and markets the connecting fabric holding international peace
together]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} **[Gartzke]{.underline}**
and Li argue, for example, how the demonstrators who took the streets
'from Seattle to Switzerland and from Gothenburg to Jakarta ...
mobilised by apocalyptic visions of the menace of globalisation' failed
to recognize that economic integration offers mutual benefits to states
that opt for settlements in the place of fighting (Gartzke & Li, 2003,
p. 562). This is, of course, a caricature of 'alter-globalisation'
movements that fails to acknowledge the transnational networks behind
such movements.6 Yet, it is a useful example to show how, [by focusing
on states as the aggregate beneficiaries of 'efficient' modes of
transnational production and exchange, liberal scholarship **eschews**
the variegated forms of politico-economic conflict that market
reordering foments at intrastate scales]{.underline}. [The **crucial
point** is that]{.underline}, with the complexities of global dynamics
flattened into a chessboard of one-dimensional state actors, [mainstream
IR perspectives are often unable to address the **multiscalar violent
repercussions** of liberal market integration and therefore its
challenges to **positive peace**]{.underline} -- [understood as 'the
possibility of **maximising human potential'**]{.underline} (Flint,
2005, p. 7) and the absence of structural, cultural and environmental
violence (Galtung, 1996; Richmond, 2008, p. 89). [Peace, much like war,
operates at '**intertwined** and **mutually constitutive'** scales, from
the **intimate to the global**]{.underline} (Koopman, 2011, p. 194).
[Anchored in]{.underline} mid-20th-century [statist notions of world
politics, conventional IR understandings of peace and conflict are
**oblivious to threats to everyday peace**]{.underline} when state power
is not directly under challenge. In this way, [foreign direct investment
or trade are considered phenomena that bring states more closely
integrated]{.underline}, hence either increasing the likelihood of peace
(from the liberal perspective) or not necessarily having an impact on
the probability of conflict in the long term (from the realist
perspective). [Yet, the undemocratic trends behind processes of
transnationalization of capital reproduce **new and old forms of
violence**]{.underline}. John Nagle, a political anthropologist of
ethnic conflict, highlights, for example, how [global market
integration]{.underline} may indeed '[cause a violent
backlash]{.underline} if [economic reconstruction dispossesses groups
from their land or dismantles their traditional economic systems without
providing acceptable alternatives']{.underline} (Nagle, 2010, p. 232),
or what could also be described as processes of primitive accumulation
without immediate proletarianization. [The creation of masses of
unemployed youth, surplus to the immediate exploitative needs of
capital, is of course an important factor behind the rise of violence in
many societies]{.underline}, as, for example, many in the Caribbean
(Pantin, 1996). Moreover, these processes of dispossession and the
dismantling of livelihoods are per se violent by-products of neoliberal
integration. [Violent neoliberalism, mediated not by an invisible hand
but by **explicit elite interests**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2005) or more
subject-based processes of governmentality (Larner, 2000[), is a
recurrent phenomenon]{.underline} in the study of the globalization of
capitalism. [The integration of 'developing countries' with global
markets is typically **plagued** with **violent rationales** of
development and tangible issues of exploitation and
dispossession]{.underline}, as vividly [exemplified in]{.underline}
Simon Springer's studies of violent neoliberalism in
**[Cambodia]{.underline}** (Springer, 2015). An important issue to be
considered here is the transformation of the state alongside processes
of economic globalization, adopting increasingly competitive and
regulatory forms, and ubiquitously morphing into what some have
described as 'capitalist states' (Jessop, 2002). This transformation
implies that, through processes of disciplinary neoliberalism (Gill,
1995), [states]{.underline} can in fact mediate between global
competitive forces and domestic societies not to protect the latter from
outside dangers or the recurring crises of capitalism, but in fact to
[impose measures of austerity, protect creditors, and]{.underline} in
general [**promote** more **precarious and vulnerable patterns of
living**]{.underline}. [A powerful example of violent neoliberalism is
found in processes of worker exploitation fomented by flexible regimes
of accumulation required to attract capital investment. This explains
why 70,000 workplace casualties in China]{.underline} during 2012 (The
Economist, 2013) -- a country where workers' independent organization is
to a great extent illegal, or 180,000 protests in 2010 (The Wall Street
Journal, 2011), [do not affect IR's calculations of peace]{.underline},
despite the close link between these incidents and exploitation dynamics
associated with China's integration into global markets (Chan, 2001). It
is only from this perspective that IR scholars in China can present
their country's growing economic pre-eminence as a 'peaceful rise',
arguing that 'the Chinese have made \[the choice\] to embrace economic
globalization rather than detach themselves from it' (Zheng, 2005).
Ironically, given the ostensible incompatibility between liberal
emphases upon freedom and pluralism and state propaganda, Chinese
official media also suggests that globalization and peace provide
'favourable conditions for building a harmonious society', where 'the
political environment is stable, the economy is prosperous, people live
in peace and work in comfort and social welfare improves' (People's
Daily, 2007). The actual 'harmonisation' of society in China has indeed
entailed occasional improvements in welfare provision and some
concessions to labour -- for example, in the form of a new Labour
Contract Law in 2007 that required firms to give written contracts to
their workers. Yet, disciplinary measures hold sway, and the very
lawyers who sought to protect worker rights under the Labour Contract
Law framework are being incarcerated under the charges of 'disturbing
social order', while income inequality and labour unrest have continued
to rise (Financial Times, 2016; Hui & Chan, 2011). And crucially,
[intrastate violence can in turn be rescaled to the inter-national
sphere]{.underline}. Therefore, analysts often associate the rise in
protests and repression in China with the Chinese Communist Party's
orchestration of and permissiveness towards nationalist campaigns and
patriotic discourse -- including typical recourse to international
belligerence over disputed territories and anti-Western rhetoric -- in
search for legitimacy (Hughes, 2006). Similarly, [[there has been an
emergence of **inequality**, **vulnerability** and
**precarization**]{.mark} in economically developed
countries]{.underline} that can also be analyzed [[under the framework
of violent neoliberalism.]{.mark} As transnational capital benefits from
exploiting the world's largest unfree labour force in China and other
low and middle income countries, middle classes]{.underline} elsewhere
[have seen their rights and economic power decline]{.underline}. In the
United States, the last [decades of globalization]{.underline} and
prosperity [have been accompanied by **increased levels of poverty**, a
**net decline of**]{.underline} 2.7 million **[jobs]{.underline}**
between 2001 and 2011, [and **declining** inflation-adjusted minimum
**wages**]{.underline} (Mischel & Davis, 2015; Scott, 2015; Shaefer &
Edin, 2013). [Marketization has reached **grotesque proportions**,
and]{.underline} today even [the disciplinary apparatus of the state is
up for sale, resulting in **skyrocketing incarceration**
rates]{.underline}, chiefly affecting impoverished populations and the
African American community (BBC, 2014). [In Spain, a rampant series of
evictions]{.underline} following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis --
with over 600,000 foreclosures from 2008 to 2015 (El País, 2015) --
[left families homeless while political elites transferred €100 billion
of public wealth to private and privatized financial
institutions]{.underline}, with four-fifths of the sum deemed
unrecoverable according to the estimations of the Spanish Central Bank.
[Global and national processes have in this way powerful impacts on
other scales, including the personal lived experiences of
crisis]{.underline}. In the United States, studies find that the 40%
rise in suicides since 1999 is connected to the recession of 2007--09,
while [the]{.underline} World Health Organisation ([WHO]{.underline})
[observes a 60% **increase in suicide rates** across the
world]{.underline} over the last 45 years that appears to be [connected
to periodic **spikes in economic hardship**]{.underline} (Oyesanya,
Lopez-Morinigo, & Dutta, 2015; Whiteman, 2015). With global affluence
concentrated in increasingly fewer hands (with eight people having the
same amount of wealth as 50% of the world's population according to some
studies; Hardoon, 2017), and with risk gradually removed from markets
and transferred to increasingly vulnerable individuals, national
illiberal politics has come to constitute a logical reaction to the
liberal order for many, or a quest for refuge from the violence of
markets, however fraught the responses offered by many of the populist
alternatives now in vogue. [Another]{.underline} vivid
[example]{.underline} of violent neoliberalism [is]{.underline} seen in
[the]{.underline} apparent [capitulation of]{.underline} the future of
[the world's environment and the present livelihoods of many to the
immediate needs of capital]{.underline}. Here we see t[he expansion of
capitalist activities in search of]{.underline} previously [**untapped
resources** in the developing world]{.underline} and elsewhere [driving
**conflict with local populations** and fomenting processes of
**internal colonialism** and **dispossession**]{.underline}
(Gonzalez-Vicente, 2017; Kaag & Zoomers, 2014). Even a wide range of
allegedly well-intentioned [initiatives]{.underline} to preserve
biodiversity operate now according to market logics,
[rely]{.underline}ing [on the valuation and commodification of nature
and the deployment of green credentials]{.underline} ultimately [to
displace populations]{.underline} in ways that are reminiscent of
processes of primitive accumulation (Fairhead, Leachm, & Scoones, 2012;
Lohmann, 2010). And, of course[, climate change and environmental
degradation]{.underline} in general [have become key drivers of global
migrations]{.underline}, with the risk of being displaced by natural
disasters today being 60% higher than 40 years ago and 25.4 million
people needing to migrate every year to escape the consequences of
natural disasters (Greenpeace, 2017, p. 6). Crucial here -- once again
-- is the fact that our current global [environmental crisis cannot be
understood outside the context of global liberal
integration]{.underline}, as the promotion of 'good business
environments' (note the irony) and competition across jurisdictions to
attract capital investments have resulted in any attempt to make
businesses pay for the environmental 'externalities' of production being
just a marginal note in a downward trajectory towards an environmental
dystopia. [These violent by-products of liberal integration operate at
scales that go from the global to the intimate]{.underline}. Yet,
despite the vast amounts of empirical evidence illustrating the violence
inherent in processes of marketization, [the **epistemological
limitations of IRT** create **illusions of liberal peace** in the
absence of conflict between states]{.underline}. The examples above
illustrate how [state-based peace is limited in its implications for the
everyday lives of many people and]{.underline} may even be
[counterproductive at diverse scales where violence is systematically
applied and justified to perpetuate liberal state peace and market
integration]{.underline}. Importantly, people are not just victims of
violence, but agents of political change. If at an early stage of
globalization liberal elites were able to contain discontent through
appeals to technical prowess, claims of a lack of viable alternatives
(see, for example, Margaret Thatcher's famous 'there is no alternative'
mantra) and the depoliticization of policy more broadly, today we
observe a process of re-politicization that often takes reactionary
forms (Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017). While in some countries
progressive alternatives to the liberal order are revitalizing the
political debate, and indeed solidarity campaigns have delivered some
important victories across the world, what we observe in many places
today is the conjunction of national reactionary discourse (with elites
placing responsibilities for the social crisis on foreign forces and
migrants, for example) and a continued hegemony of markets. This new
populist order dangerously combines an economic base that will continue
to produce market violence with nationalist rationales that undermine
internationalist solidarity, and which unfortunately invite further
violence towards the 'other'.

//pyrex ultra

While in the first case citizen-subjects are treated solely as economic
beings, in the second case [[the state is conceived as an
enterprise]{.underline}]{.mark}, i.e., a production unit, an economic
agency [whose functions are persistently submitted to]{.underline}
various forms of [economic auditing, thereby suppressing all other
(social, political, ecological) priorities through a permanent economic
criticism. Subcontracting, public-private partnerships, and
privatization are all]{.underline} different [mechanisms through
which]{.underline} contemporary [governments embrace]{.underline} the
discourses and [practices of contemporary multinational
corporations]{.underline}. In either case, however, [economic policy
decisions]{.underline} (whether they involve macroeconomic or
microeconomic matters) [are isolated from public debate and
deliberation, and treated as matters of technocratic design and
implementation]{.underline}, while regulation, to the extent it is
warranted, is mostly conducted by experts outside political life---the
so-called independent regulatory agencies. [[In the process, democratic
participation]{.underline}]{.mark} in decision-making [[is either
limited to an already highly-commodified]{.underline}]{.mark},
spectacularized, mediatized [[electoral politics, or
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the calculus of opinion polls where consumer
discontent can be managed through [public relations]{.underline}
experts. [As a result, [a highly reductionist
notion]{.mark}]{.underline} of economic efficiency [ends up being the
only criteria with which to measure]{.underline} the success or failure
of such [decisions]{.underline}. Meanwhile, individuals with financial
means are free to provide support to those in need through charity
organizations or corporations via their social responsibility channels.
Here, two related caveats should be noted to sharpen the central thrust
of the argument proposed in this chapter. First, the [separation of the
economic sphere from the social-ecological whole is not an ontological
given, but rather a political project. By]{.underline} treating social
subjectivity solely in economic terms and deliberately [[trying to
insulate policy-making from]{.underline}]{.mark} popular
[politics]{.underline} and democratic participation, [[the neoliberal
project]{.underline}]{.mark} of economization [makes a political
choice]{.underline}. Since there are no economic decisions without a
multitude of complex and over-determined social consequences, [the
attempt to block (through economization) all]{.underline} [political
modes of]{.underline} dissent, [objection]{.underline} and negotiation
available (e.g., "voice") to those who are affected from the said
economic decisions [is itself a political choice. In short,
economization is itself a political project.]{.underline} Yet, [this
drive towards technocratization and economization]{.underline}---which
constitutes the second caveat[---does not mean that the dirty and messy
distortions of politics are gradually being removed from policy-making.
On the contrary, to the extent]{.underline} that [policy making
is]{.underline} being [insulated]{.underline} from popular and
democratic control, [it becomes exposed to the "distortions"
of]{.underline} a politics of [rent-seeking and
speculation]{.underline}---ironically, as predicted by the
representatives of the Virginia School. Most [public-private
partnerships are hammered behind closed doors of a bureaucracy where
states and multinational corporations divide the economic rent among
themselves. The growing concentration of capital]{.underline} at the
global scale [gives various industries]{.underline} (armament, chemical,
health care, petroleum, etc.---see, e.g., Klein, 2008)
[enormous]{.underline} amount of [leverage]{.underline} over the
governments (especially the developing ones). It is extremely important,
however, to note that [this]{.underline} tendency toward rent-seeking
[is not a perversion of the neoliberal reason. For much of neoliberal
theory]{.underline} (in particular, for the Austrian and the Chicago
schools), [private monopolies and]{.underline} other forms of
[concentration of capital are preferred to government]{.underline}
control and [ownership.]{.underline} And furthermore, for some (such as
the Virginia and the Chicago schools), rent-seeking is a natural
implication of the "opportunism" of human beings, even though neoliberal
thinkers disagree whether rent-seeking is essentially economically
efficient (as in "capture" theories of the Chicago school imply) or
inefficient (as in rent-seeking theories of the Virginia school imply)
(Madra and Adaman, 2010). [This reconfiguration]{.underline} of the way
modern states in advanced capitalist social formations govern the social
[manifests]{.underline} itself [in all domains of **public and social**
policy-making.]{.underline} From education to health, and employment to
insurance, [there is an observable shift from]{.underline} rights-based
policymaking forged through public [deliberation and participation, to
policy-making based solely on economic viability where policy issues are
treated as matters of technocratic calculation. In this
regard]{.underline}, as noted above, the [treatment of subjectivity
solely in behaviorist terms of economic incentives functions as the key
conceptual choice]{.underline} that makes the technocratization of
public policy possible. Neoliberal thinking and practices certainly have
a significant impact on the ecology. The next section will focus on the
different means through which various forms of neoliberal
governmentality propose and actualize the economization of the ecology.

for]{.underline} growth and [progress]{.underline}; specialization and
the replacement of a subsistence economy with profit-oriented foreign
trade ('comparative cost advantage'); and the proscription of public
(state) interference with market forces.\[3\] Where the new economic
liberalism outdoes the old is in its global claim. Today's [economic
liberalism functions as a model for]{.underline} each and [everyone:
all]{.underline} parts [of the economy]{.underline}, all sectors of
[society]{.underline}, of [life]{.underline}/nature
[itself]{.underline}. As a consequence, the once "de-bedded" economy now
claims to "im-bed" everything, including political power. Furthermore,
[a new **twisted "economic ethics"**]{.underline} (and with it a certain
idea of "human nature") [emerges that mocks everything from]{.underline}
so-called do-gooders to [**altruism** to]{.underline} selfless help to
**[care for others]{.underline}** to a notion of responsibility.\[4\]
This goes as far as claiming that the common good depends entirely on
the uncontrolled egoism of the individual and, especially, on the
prosperity of transnational corporations. The allegedly necessary
"freedom" of the economy -- which, paradoxically, only means the freedom
of corporations -- hence consists of a freedom from responsibility and
commitment to society. [The maximization of profit]{.underline} itself
must occur within the shortest possible time; this [means]{.underline},
preferably, through [speculation and "shareholder value"]{.underline}.
It must meet as few obstacles as possible. Today, global [economic
interests outweigh]{.underline} not only [extra-economic
concerns]{.underline} but also [national economic considerations since
corporations today see themselves beyond both community and
nation]{.underline}.\[5\] A "level playing field" is created that offers
the global players the best possible conditions. This playing field
knows of no legal, social, ecological, cultural or national
"barriers".\[6\] As a result, [economic competition plays out on a
market that is free of all]{.underline} non-market,
[extra-economic]{.underline} or protectionist [influences]{.underline}
-- unless they serve the interests of the big players (the
corporations), of course. The [corporations' interests]{.underline} --
their maximal growth and progress -- [take]{.underline} on [complete
priority]{.underline}. This is rationalized by alleging that their
well-being means the well-being of small enterprises and workshops as
well. The difference between the new and the old economic liberalism can
first be articulated in quantitative terms: after capitalism went
through a series of ruptures and challenges -- caused by the "competing
economic system", the crisis of capitalism, post-war "Keynesianism" with
its social and welfare state tendencies, internal mass consumer demand
(so-called Fordism), and the objective of full employment in the North.
The liberal economic goals of the past are now not only euphorically
resurrected but they are also "globalized". The main reason is indeed
that the competition between alternative economic systems is gone.
However, to conclude that this confirms the victory of capitalism and
the "golden West" over "dark socialism" is only one possible
interpretation. Another -- opposing -- interpretation is to see the
"modern world system" (which contains both capitalism and socialism) as
having hit a general crisis which causes total and merciless competition
over global resources while leveling the way for investment
opportunities, i.e. the valorization of capital.\[7\] The ongoing
globalization of neoliberalism demonstrates which interpretation is
right. Not least, because the differences between the old and the new
economic liberalism can not only be articulated in quantitative terms
but in qualitative ones too. What we are witnessing are completely new
phenomena: instead of a democratic "complete competition" between many
small enterprises enjoying the freedom of the market, only the [big
corporations]{.underline} win. In turn, they [create new market
oligopolies and monopolies of previously unknown dimensions. The
market]{.underline} hence [only remains free for them, while it is
rendered **unfree for all others** who are condemned to an **existence
of dependency**]{.underline} (as enforced producers, workers and
consumers) [or **excluded from the market altogether**]{.underline} (if
they have neither anything to sell or buy). About fifty percent of the
world's population fall into this group today, and the percentage is
rising.\[8\] [Anti-trust laws]{.underline} have [lost all power
since]{.underline} the transnational **[corporations set the
norms]{.underline}**. It is the corporations -- not "the market" as an
anonymous mechanism or "invisible hand" -- that determine today's rules
of trade, for example prices **[and legal regulations]{.underline}**.
This happens [outside any political control]{.underline}. Speculation
with an average twenty percent profit margin edges out honest producers
who become "unprofitable".\[9\] Money becomes too precious for
comparatively non-profitable, long-term projects, or projects that only
-- how audacious! -- serve a good life. [Money]{.underline} instead
"[travels upwards]{.underline}" [and disappears]{.underline}. Financial
capital determines more and more what the markets are and do.\[10\] By
delinking the dollar from the price of gold, money creation no longer
bears a direct relationship to production".\[11\] Moreover, these days
[most of us are]{.underline} -- exactly like all governments -- [in
debt]{.underline}. It is financial capital that has all the money -- we
have none.\[12\] [Small]{.underline}, medium, even some bigger
[enterprises are pushed out of the market]{.underline}, forced to fold
or [swallowed by transnational corporations]{.underline} because their
performances are below average in comparison to speculation -- rather:
spookulation -- wins. [The public sector]{.underline}, which has
historically been defined as a sector of not-for-profit economy and
administration, [is "slimmed" and its "profitable" parts]{.underline}
("gems") [handed to corporations]{.underline}
([privatized]{.underline}). As a consequence, [social
services]{.underline} that are **[necessary for our existence
disappear]{.underline}**. Small and medium private businesses -- which,
until recently, employed eighty percent of the workforce and provided
normal working conditions -- are affected by these developments as well.
[The alleged correlation between economic growth and secure employment
is false]{.underline}. When economic growth is accompanied by the
mergers of businesses, jobs are lost.\[13\] If there are any [new
jobs]{.underline}, most [are precarious]{.underline}, meaning that they
are only [available temporarily and badly paid]{.underline}. One job is
usually not enough to make a living.\[14\] This means that the working
conditions in the North become akin to those in the South, and the
working conditions of men akin to those of women -- a trend
diametrically opposed to what we have always been told.
[Corporations]{.underline} now [leave for the South (or East) to use
cheap]{.underline} -- and particularly [female]{.underline} -- [labor
without union affiliation]{.underline}. This has already been happening
since the 1970s [in]{.underline} the "Export Processing Zones"
([EPZs]{.underline}, "world market factories" or "maquiladoras"),
[where]{.underline} most of the world's [computer chips, sneakers,
clothes and electronic goods are produced]{.underline}.\[15\] The EPZs
lie in areas where [century-old colonial-capitalist and
authoritarian-patriarchal conditions guarantee the availability of cheap
labor]{.underline}.\[16\] The recent shift of business opportunities
from consumer goods to armaments is a particularly troubling
development.\[17\] It is not only commodity production that is
"outsourced" and located in the EPZs, but service industries as well.
This is a result of the so-called Third Industrial Revolution, meaning
the development of new information and communication technologies. Many
jobs have disappeared entirely due to computerization, also in
administrative fields.\[18\] The combination of the principles of "high
tech" and "low wage"/"no wage" (always denied by "progress" enthusiasts)
guarantees a "comparative cost advantage" in foreign trade. This will
eventually lead to "Chinese wages" in the West. A potential loss of
Western consumers is not seen as a threat. A corporate economy does not
care whether consumers are European, Chinese or Indian. [The means of
production become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands]{.underline},
especially [since finance capital]{.underline} -- rendered precarious
itself -- [controls asset values ever more aggressively. New forms of
private property are created]{.underline}, not least [through the
"clearance" of public property and the transformation of]{.underline}
formerly [public]{.underline} and small-scale private
[services]{.underline} and industries [to a corporate business
sector]{.underline}. This concerns primarily fields that have long been
(at least partly) excluded from the logic of profit -- e.g. [education,
health, energy or water supply/disposal. **New**]{.underline} forms of
so-called [**enclosures** emerge from]{.underline} today's total
[commercialization of]{.underline} formerly small-scale private or
public industries and services, of [the "commons",]{.underline} and of
natural resources [like **oceans**, **rain forests**, regions of genetic
diversity or geopolitical interest]{.underline} (e.g. potential pipeline
routes), etc.\[19\] As far as the new virtual spaces and communication
networks go, we are witnessing frantic efforts to bring these under
private control as well.\[20\] All [these]{.underline} new forms of
private property [are]{.underline} essentially [created by]{.underline}
(more or less) [predatory forms of appropriation]{.underline}. In this
sense, they are a continuation of the history of so-called original
accumulation which has expanded globally, in accordance with to the
motto: "Growth through expropriation!"\[21\] [Most people have less and
less access to the means of production]{.underline}, and so the
[**dependence on scarce and underpaid work increases**. The destruction
of the welfare state]{.underline} also [destroys the notion that
individuals can rely on the community to provide for them in times of
need. Our existence relies exclusively on private]{.underline}, i.e.
expensive, [services]{.underline} that are often [of much worse
quality]{.underline} and much less reliable than public services. (It is
a myth that the private always outdoes the public.) What we are
experiencing is undersupply formerly only known by the colonial South.
[The old claim that the South will eventually develop into the North is
proven wrong]{.underline}. It is the North that increasingly develops
into the South. We are witnessing the latest form of "development",
namely, a world system of underdevelopment.\[22\] Development and
underdevelopment go hand in hand.\[23\] This might even dawn on
"development aid" workers soon. It is usually women who are called upon
to counterbalance underdevelopment through increased work ("service
provisions") in the household. As a result, the workload and underpay of
women takes on horrendous dimensions: they do unpaid work inside their
homes and poorly paid "housewifized" work outside.\[24\] Yet,
commercialization does not stop in front of the home's doors either.
Even housework becomes commercially co-opted ("new maid question"), with
hardly any financial benefits for the women who do the work.\[25\] Not
least because of this, women are increasingly coerced into prostitution,
one of today's biggest global industries.\[26\] This illustrates two
things: a) how little the "emancipation" of women actually leads to
"equal terms" with men; and b) that "capitalist development" does not
imply increased "freedom" in wage labor relations, as the Left has
claimed for a long time.\[27\] If the latter were the case, then
neoliberalism would mean the voluntary end of capitalism once it reaches
its furthest extension. This, however, does not appear likely. Today,
[hundreds of millions of quasi-slaves]{.underline}, more than ever
before, [exist in the "world system."]{.underline}\[28\] [The
authoritarian model of the "Export Processing Zones" is conquering the
East and threatening the North]{.underline}. The [redistribution of
wealth runs]{.underline} ever more -- and with ever accelerated speed --
[from the bottom to the top. The gap between the rich and the poor has
never been wider]{.underline}. The middle classes disappear. This is the
situation we are facing. It becomes obvious that [neoliberalism marks
not the end of colonialism but]{.underline}, to the contrary,
[the]{.underline} colonization of the North. This new "[colonization of
the world]{.underline}"\[29\] points back to the beginnings of the
"modern world system" in the "long 16th century", when the conquering of
the Americas, their exploitation and colonial transformation allowed for
the rise and "development" of Europe.\[30\] The so-called "children's
diseases" of modernity keep on haunting it, even in old age. They are,
in fact, the main feature of modernity's latest stage. They are
expanding instead of disappearing. Where there is no South, there is no
North; where there is no periphery, there is no center; where there is
no colony, there is no -- in any case no "Western" --
civilization.\[31\] Austria is part of the world system too. It is
increasingly becoming a corporate colony (particularly of German
corporations). This, however, does not keep it from being an active
colonizer itself, especially in the East.\[32\] [Social, cultural,
traditional and ecological considerations are abandoned and give way to
a **mentality of plundering**. All global resources]{.underline} that we
still have -- natural resources, forests, water, genetic pools -- [have
turned into **objects of utilization**. **Rapid ecological destruction**
through **depletion** is the consequence]{.underline}. If one makes more
profit by [cutting down trees]{.underline} than by planting them, then
there is no reason not to cut them.\[33\] Neither the public nor the
state interferes, despite [global warming]{.underline} and the obvious
fact that the clearing [of]{.underline} the [few]{.underline} remaining
[rain forests]{.underline} will irreversibly destroy the earth's climate
-- not to mention the many other negative effects of such actions.\[34\]
[Climate, animal, plants, human and general ecological rights are worth
nothing compared to the interests of the corporations]{.underline} -- no
matter that the rain forest is not a renewable resource and that the
entire earth's ecosystem depends on it. If greed, and the rationalism
with which it is economically enforced, really was an inherent
anthropological trait, we would have never even reached this day. The
commander of the Space Shuttle that circled the earth in 2005 remarked
that "the center of Africa was burning". She meant the Congo, in which
the last great rain forest of the continent is located. Without it there
will be no more rain clouds above the sources of the Nile. However, it
needs to disappear in order for corporations to gain free access to the
Congo's natural resources that are the reason for the wars that plague
the region today. After all, one needs diamonds and coltan for mobile
phones. Today, [everything on earth is **turned into
commodities**]{.underline}, i.e. everything becomes [an object of
"trade" and commercialization]{.underline} (which truly means
liquidation, the transformation of all into liquid money). In its
neoliberal stage it is not enough for capitalism to globally pursue less
cost-intensive and preferably "wageless" commodity production. [The
objective is to transform everyone and everything into commodities,
**including life itself**]{.underline}.\[35\] We are racing blindly
towards the violent and absolute conclusion of this "mode of
production", namely total capitalization/liquidation by
"monetarization".\[36\] We are not only witnessing perpetual praise of
the market -- we are witnessing what can be described as "market
fundamentalism". People believe in the market as if it was a god. There
seems to be a sense that nothing could ever happen without it. [Total
global maximized accumulation of money/capital as abstract wealth
becomes the sole purpose of economic activity]{.underline}. A "free"
world market for everything has to be established -- a world market that
functions according to the interests of the corporations and capitalist
money. The installment of such a market proceeds with dazzling speed. It
creates new profit possibilities where they have not existed before,
e.g. in Iraq, Eastern Europe or China. One thing remains generally
overlooked: [the abstract wealth created for accumulation implies the
destruction of nature as concrete wealth. The result is a "hole in the
ground" and]{.underline} next to it [a garbage dump]{.underline} with
used commodities, outdated machinery and money without value.\[37\]
However, [once all concrete wealth]{.underline} (which today consists
mainly of the last natural resources) [will be gone, abstract wealth
will disappear as well]{.underline}. It will, in Marx's words,
"evaporate". The fact that [abstract wealth is not real
wealth]{.underline} will become obvious, and so will the answer to the
question of which wealth modern economic activity has really created. In
the end it is nothing but [monetary wealth]{.underline} (and even this
mainly exists virtually or on accounts) that [constitutes a monoculture
controlled by a tiny minority. Diversity is suffocated and millions of
people are left wondering how to survive]{.underline}. And really: how
do you survive with neither resources nor means of production nor money?
[The **nihilism** of our economic system is evident. The whole world
will be transformed into money]{.underline} -- [and then it will
disappear]{.underline}. After all, [money cannot be eaten]{.underline}.
What no one seems to consider is the fact that it is impossible to
re-transform commodities, money, capital and machinery into nature or
concrete wealth. It seems that [underlying all "economic development" is
the assumption that "resources"]{.underline}, the "sources of
wealth",\[38\] [are renewable and everlasting]{.underline} -- just like
the "growth" they create.\[39\] The notion that capitalism and democracy
are one is proven a myth by neoliberalism and its "monetary
totalitarianism".\[40\] [The primacy of politics over economy has been
lost]{.underline}. Politicians of all parties have abandoned it. It is
the corporations that dictate politics. Where corporate interests are
concerned, there is no place for democratic convention or community
control. Public space disappears. The res publica turns into a res
privata, or -- as we could say today -- a res privata transnationale (in
its original Latin meaning, privare means "to deprive"). Only those in
power still have rights. They give themselves the licenses they need,
from the "license to plunder" to the "license to kill".\[41\] Those who
get in their way or challenge their "rights" are vilified, criminalized
and to an increasing degree defined as "terrorists" or, in the case of
defiant governments, as "rogue states" -- a label that usually implies
threatened or actual military attack, as we can see in the cases of
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and maybe Syria and Iran in the near
future. U.S. President Bush had even spoken of the possibility of
"preemptive" nuclear strikes should the U.S. feel endangered by weapons
of mass destruction.\[42\] The European Union did not object.\[43\]
**[Neoliberalism and war are two sides of the same
coin]{.underline}**.\[44\] [Free trade, piracy and war are still "an
inseparable three"]{.underline} -- today maybe more so than ever. [War
is not only "good for the economy" but is indeed its driving force and
can be understood as the "continuation of economy with other
means"]{.underline}.\[45\] War and economy have become almost
indistinguishable.\[46\] [Wars about resources]{.underline} --
[especially oil and water]{.underline} -- [have already
begun]{.underline}.\[47\] [The Gulf Wars are the most
obvious]{.underline} examples. [Militarism]{.underline} once again
[appears as **the "executor of capital accumulation**]{.underline}" --
potentially everywhere and enduringly.\[48\] [Human rights]{.underline}
and rights of sovereignty [have been transferred from
people]{.underline}, communities and governments [to
corporations]{.underline}.\[49\] The notion of the people as a sovereign
body has practically been abolished. We have witnessed a coup of sorts.
The political systems of the West and the nation state as guarantees for
and expression of the international division of labor in the modern
world system are increasingly dissolving.\[50\] Nation states are
developing into "periphery states" according to the inferior role they
play in the proto-despotic "New World Order".\[51\] Democracy appears
outdated. After all, it "hinders business".\[52\] The "New World Order"
implies a new division of labor that does no longer distinguish between
North and South, East and West -- today, everywhere is South. An
according [International Law]{.underline} is established which
effectively functions from top to bottom ("top-down") and [eliminates
all local and regional communal rights]{.underline}. And not only that:
many such rights are rendered invalid both retroactively and for the
future.\[53\] [The logic of neoliberalism]{.underline} as a sort of
totalitarian neo-mercantilism [is that all resources, all markets, all
money, all profits, all means of production, all "investment
opportunities", all rights and all power **belong to the corporations
only**]{.underline}. To paraphrase Richard Sennett: "Everything to the
Corporations!"\[54\] One might add: "Now!" The
[corporations]{.underline} are free to [do whatever they
please]{.underline} with what they get. Nobody is allowed to interfere.
Ironically, we are expected to rely on them to find a way out of the
crisis we are in. [This puts the **entire globe at risk** since
responsibility is something the corporations do not have or
know]{.underline}. The times of social contracts are gone.\[55\] In
fact, pointing out the crisis alone has become a crime and all critique
will soon be defined as "terror" and persecuted as such.\[56\] IMF
Economic Medicine Since the 1980s, it is mainly the [Structural
Adjustment Programs (SAPs) of the World Bank and the IMF]{.underline}
that [act as the enforcers of neoliberalism]{.underline}. These programs
are [levied against the countries of the South which can be extorted due
to their debts. Meanwhile]{.underline}, numerous [military interventions
and wars]{.underline} help to [take possession of the assets that still
remain, secure resources, install neoliberalism as the global economic
politics, crush resistance movements]{.underline} (which are cynically
labeled as "IMF uprisings"), [and facilitate the lucrative business of
reconstruction]{.underline}.\[57\] In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and
Margaret Thatcher introduced neoliberalism in Anglo-America. In 1989,
[the]{.underline} so-called "[Washington Consensus]{.underline}" was
formulated. It claimed to lead to global freedom, prosperity and
economic growth through "deregulation, liberalization and
privatization". This has become the credo and promise of all
neoliberals. Today we know that the promise has come true for the
corporations only -- not for anybody else. In the Middle East, the
Western support for Saddam Hussein in the war between Iraq and Iran in
the 1980s, and the Gulf War of the early 1990s, [announced the permanent
U.S. presence in the world's most contested oil region]{.underline}. In
[continental Europe, neoliberalism began with the crisis in Yugoslavia
caused by]{.underline} the Structural Adjustment Programs
([SAPs]{.underline}) of the World Bank and the IMF. [The country was
heavily exploited, fell apart and finally beset by a civil war over its
last remaining resources]{.underline}.\[58\] Since the NATO war in 1999,
[the Balkans are fragmented, occupied and geopolitically under
neoliberal control]{.underline}.\[59\] [The region is of main strategic
interest for future oil and gas transport from the Caucasus to the
West]{.underline} (for example the "Nabucco" gas pipeline that is
supposed to start operating from the Caspian Sea through Turkey and the
Balkans by 2011.\[60\] [The reconstruction of the Balkans is exclusively
in the hands of Western corporations]{.underline}. All governments,
whether left, right, liberal or green, accept this. There is no analysis
of the connection between the politics of neoliberalism, its history,
its background and its effects on Europe and other parts of the world.
Likewise, there is no analysis of its connection to the new militarism.

### A2: Util

#### Utilitarian Calculus paves over the structural violence that occurs before and after war occurs

\[Elizabeth **Olson 15**\] ('Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and
Urgency,' *Progress in Human Geography*, vol. 39 no. 4, pp. 517-526,
prof of geography @ UNC Chapel Hill) xx-xx-2015 //pyrex ultra

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [the body is increasingly set
at odds with large]{.underline}r [scale ethical concerns, especially
**large-scale future events of forecasted suffering**]{.underline}.
Emergency planning is a particularly good example in which the
[large-scale threats of future suffering can **distort moral
reasoning**]{.underline}. Žižek (2006) lightly develops this point in
the context of the war on terror, where in the presence of fictitious
and real ticking clocks and warning systems, [the urgent body must be
**bypassed** because there are **bigger scales to worry
about**]{.underline}:¶ What does this all-pervasive sense of urgency
mean ethically? The pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are
so high, that they nec essitate a suspension of ordinary ethical
concerns. After all, displaying moral qualms when the lives of millions
are at stake plays into the hands of the enemy. (Žižek, 2006)¶ In the
presence of large-scale future emergency, [the urgency to secure the
state, the citizenry, the economy, or the climate creates new scales and
new temporal orders of response]{.underline} (see Anderson, 2010;
Baldwin, 2012; Dalby, 2013; Morrissey, 2012), many of which treat the
urgent body as impulsive and thus requiring management. McDonald's
(2013) analysis of three interconnected discourses of 'climate security'
illustrates how bodily urgency in climate change is also recast as a
menacing impulse that might require exclusion from moral reckoning. The
logics of climate security, especially those related to national
security, 'can encourage perverse political responses that not only fail
to respond effectively to climate change but may present victims of it
as a threat' (McDonald, 2013: 49). [**Bodies that are currently
suffering cannot be urgent**, because they are **excluded from the
potential collectivity** that could be **suffering everywhere in some
future time**]{.underline}. Similar [bypassing of existing bodily
urgency is echoed in writing about]{.underline} violent securitization,
such as drone warfare (Shaw and Akhter, 2012), and also in [**intimate
scales** like the street and the school, especially in relation to
race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et al., 2014).¶ [As
**large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized**, the urgent body
is increasingly **obscured through technical planning and
coordination**]{.underline} (Anderson and Adey, 2012). [The predominant
characteristic of this institutionalization]{.underline} of large-scale
emergency [is a '**built-in bias for action'**]{.underline} (Wuthnow,
2010: 212) **[that circumvents contingencies]{.underline}**. [The urgent
body is at best an assumed eventuality, one that will]{.underline}
likely [require]{.underline} another state of waiting, such as
**[triage]{.underline}** (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013)
cautions that in much of the West, governmental need to provide evidence
of laissez-faire governing on the one hand, and assurance of strength in
facing a threatening future on the other, produces 'just-in-case
preparedness' (Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk management policies.
In the US, 'personal ingenuity' is built into emergency response at the
expense of the poor and vulnerable for whom '\[t\]he difference between
abjection and bearable survival' (Amin, 2013: 153) will not be
determined by emergency planning, but in the material infrastructure of
the city.¶ In short, [the urgencies of the body provide justifications
for social exclusion of the most marginalized based on]{.underline}
impulse and [perceived threat]{.underline}, while **[large-scale future
emergencies effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency into
the institutions of preparedness and risk avoidance]{.underline}**.
[Žižek references Arendt's]{.underline} (2006) [analysis of the banality
of evil to explain]{.underline} the [current]{.underline} state of
[ethical reasoning]{.underline} under the war on terror, noting that
people who perform morally reprehensible actions under the conditions of
urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic grandeur' (Žižek, 2006) by sacrificing
their own morality for the good of the state. But his analysis fails to
note that bodies are today so rarely legitimate sites for claiming
urgency. [In the]{.underline} context of the [**assumed priority of the
large-scale future emergency**, the urgent body becomes **literally
nonsense, a non sequitur** within societies, states and worlds that will
**always be more urgent**]{.underline}.¶ If the important ethical work
of urgency has been to identify that which must not wait, then the
capture of the power and persuasiveness of urgency by large-scale future
emergencies has consequences for the kinds of normative arguments we can
raise on behalf of urgent bodies. How, then, might waiting compare as a
normative description and critique in our own urgent time? Waiting can
be categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge, 2004;
Gray, 2011), but it also modifies the place of the individual in society
and her importance. As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes, '[waiting ... produces
hierarchies which segregate people and places into those which matter
and those which do not']{.underline}. The segregation of waiting might
produce effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery (2008:
957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be repressive,
it can also engender creative political engagement. In his research with
educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years waiting for
desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal suffering and sense
of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate cultural and
political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and spatial
effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as claiming
normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting is more
ethically ambivalent and open than urgency.¶ In other contexts, however,
our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of its
effects upon the subjects of study. [Waiting can demobilize radical
reform, **depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of the
present by delaying the revolutionary imperative to a future moment that
is forever drifting towards infinity'**]{.underline} (Springer, 2014:
407). Yonucu's (2011) analysis of the self-destructive activities of
disrespected working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of
infinite waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a
disbelief in the possibility of a future self of any value. [Waiting,
like urgency, can **undermine the possibility of
self-care**]{.underline} two-fold, first by making people wait for
essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting is '\[s\]omething
to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as evidence of
indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a signal to
exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012) suggests that
waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing 'temporal processes in
and through which political subordination is produced' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore, Auyero notes, it is not
only political subordination, but the subjective effect of waiting that
secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens find themselves
'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to make decisions,
and in effect surrendering to the authority of others' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 123).¶ [Waiting can]{.underline} therefore [function as a
potentially important spatial technology of the elite and powerful,
mobilized not only for the purpose of **governing individuals**, but
also to **retain claims over moral urgency**]{.underline}. [But there is
**growing resistance** to the capture of claims of urgency by the
elite]{.underline}, and it is important to note that even in cases where
the material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable,
[arguments based on human value are at the forefront of **reclaiming
urgency for the body**. In **detention centers, clandestine prisons,
state borders and refugee camps**, geographers point to]{.underline}
ongoing struggles against [the ethical impossibility of bodily
urgency]{.underline} and a rejection of states of waiting (see Conlon,
2011; Darling, 2009, 2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster,
2011). Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi resettlement colony and
Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave between India and Bangladesh
describe people who refuse to give up their own status as legitimately
urgent, even in the context of larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's
(2013) account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes
to expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to [the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from
view]{.underline}, and also reminds us that our research can help to
explain the relationships between normative dimensions and the political
and social conditions of struggle.¶ In closing, geographic depictions of
waiting do seem to evocatively describe otherwise obscured suffering
(e.g. Bennett, 2011), but it is striking how rarely these descriptions
also use the language of urgency. Given the discussion above, what might
be accomplished -- and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly
and deliberately into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned
bodies? Urgency can clarify the implicit but understated ethical
consequences and normativity associated with waiting, and encourage
explicit discussion about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive
or unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all' (Butler, 2009: 50). But [when the urgent body is rendered as
only waiting]{.underline}, both materially and discursively, [it is just
as easily cast as impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see
also McKittrick, 2006). [Feminist theory insists that the urgent body,
whose encounters of violence are 'usually framed as **private,
apolitical and mundane'**]{.underline} (Pain, 2014: 8), [are as deeply
**political, public, and exceptional** as other forms of
violence]{.underline} (Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005). [Insisting that **a
suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait**, has the **ethical
effect of drawing it into consideration alongside the political, public
and exceptional scope of large-scale futures**]{.underline}. [It may
help us insist on the body]{.underline}, both as a single unit and a
plurality, [as a legitimate scale of normative priority and social
care]{.underline}.¶ In this report, I have explored old and new
reflections on the ethical work of urgency and waiting. Geographic
[research suggests a contemporary popular bias towards the urgency of
large-scale futures, institutionalized in ways that]{.underline} further
**[obscure and discredit the urgencies of the body]{.underline}**. [This
bias]{.underline} also [justifies the production of new **waiting
places**]{.underline} in our material landscape, **[places like the
detention center]{.underline}** and the waiting room. In some cases,
waiting is normatively neutral, even providing opportunities for
alternative politics. In others, the technologies of waiting serve to
manage potentially problematic bodies, leading to suspended suffering
and even to extermination (e.g. Wright, 2013). One of my aims has been
to suggest that [**moral reasoning is important** both because it
**exposes normative biases against subjugated people**, and]{.underline}
because it potentially **[provides routes toward struggle where claims
to urgency seem to foreclose]{.underline}** the
**[possibilities]{.underline}** of alleviation of suffering. **[Saving
the world still should require a debate about whose world is being
saved, when, and at what cost -- and this requires a debate about what
really cannot wait]{.underline}**. My next report will extend some of
these concerns by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as well as hope,
fear, and other emotions, have played a role in geography and ethical
reasoning.¶ I conclude, however, by pulling together past and present.
In 1972, Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the
truly urgent questions' (1972: 101) such as racial repression, decaying
cities, economic inequality, and global environmental destruction. His
question highlights just how much the discipline has changed, but it is
also unnerving in its echoes of our contemporary problems. Since White's
writing, our moral reasoning has been stretched to consider the future
body and the more-than-human, alongside the presently urgent body --
topics and concerns that I have not taken up in this review but which
will provide their own new possibilities for urgent concerns. My own
hope presently is drawn from an acknowledgement that [the **temporal
characteristics of contemporary capitalism** can be interrupted in
creative ways]{.underline} (Sharma, 2014), [with the possibility of
squaring the urgent body with our large-scale future
concerns]{.underline}. [**Temporal alternatives already exist in ongoing
and emerging revolutions** and the disruption of]{.underline} claims of
cycles and [circular political processes]{.underline} (e.g. Lombard,
2013; Reyes, 2012). [Though **calls for urgency will certainly be used
to obscure evasion of responsibility**]{.underline} (e.g. Gilmore, 2008:
56, fn 6), [they may **also serve as fertile ground for radical
critique**, a truly fierce **urgency for now.**]{.underline}

That is, if as a society we come to believe that people with
biologically male bodies are the ones most likely to be strong,
rational, prudent, responsible, objective, and willing to fight if
necessary (also known as "masculine"), we will think it right that they
are the ones to rule. Conversely, if as a society we come to believe
that people with female bodies are weak, emotional, irrational, passive,
nurturing, and in need of protection (also known as "feminine"), we will
think it natural and right that most women's lives should be limited to
the private sphere of home and family. A next crucial step in thinking
about gender is to realise that its effects go beyond the meanings
ascribed to male and female bodies, and the concomitant ways that power
is (unequally) distributed amongst men and women. **[Gender also
functions as a symbolic system: our ideas about gender permeate and
shape our ideas about many other aspects of society beyond male-female
relations -- including politics, weapons, and warfare.]{.underline}**
The easiest way to see this is to look at some of the [adjectives
associated with masculinity]{.underline} (e.g., strong, rational,
prudent, active, objective) and femininity (e.g., weak, irrational,
impulsive, passive, subjective). What is immediately apparent is: -
first, they c[onstitute dichotomous pairs of characteristics which are
seen as mutually exclusive (e.g., strong/weak, active/passive, etc.); -
second, in each case, the "masculine" side of the pair is valued more
highly than the "feminine" one. - third, the very meaning of masculinity
and femininity is defined through its relation to its
"opposite"]{.underline}. That is, they are dependent upon each other for
their meaning: **[masculinities do not exist except in contrast to
femininities and vice versa]{.underline}**. This means that a man could
not be seen as insufficiently masculine or "wimpy" unless we have an
idea of the "feminine" characteristics "real" men must avoid.
Critically, **[this creation of gender-dichotomised pairings extends far
beyond a list of human characteristics: think, for example, of
culture/nature; analysis/intuition; order/disorder; assert/compromise;
military/civilian]{.underline}**. Here, too, although these pairs have
no necessary relation to male or female bodies, [in US (the dominant
Western) culture, one side of each pair is culturally coded "masculine",
the other "feminine", and the "masculine is the more highly valued. The
effect of this symbolic gender-coding is that any human action or
endeavour, no matter how unrelated to biological maleness or femaleness,
is perceived as more or less masculine or feminine -- even if only at a
subconscious level -- and valued or devalued accordingly]{.underline}.
**[In other words, ideas about gender not only shape how we perceive men
and women; they shape how we see the world. And they have political
effects]{.underline}**.

### Liberalism Bad

#### Seeing catastrophe emerge from "rogue states" is the precise strategy of liberalism \-\-- the affirmative is an assault on the ethos of death of others \-\-- making everything and anything a risk which destroys any understanding of violence because violence is everywhere! This linear construct makes it possible for us to have any portable skills

Fascistic exposure Dangers require exposure to the fact. [Manipulated
desire also requires exposure to the fact in order to force the body to
act upon the present in order to thwart certain possible
outcomes.]{.underline} Invariably, the manner in which desires are to be
mobilised in the face of certain dangers largely depends upon the
political strategies recruiting insomuch as the nature of threat is
always rationality- specific. [Every threat occasions a rational
underpinning which foregrounds its primary specificity in the collective
political imaginary. Liberal regimes for their part operate in a
particularly novel way]{.underline}. [Unlike totalitarian]{.underline}
systems which rely upon [secrecy]{.underline}, [liberalism brings
everything into the open]{.underline}. [It continually exposes us to
that which threatens the fabric of the everyday]{.underline}. Even our
own violent excesses are subject to the same treatment. [Since the
sources of our anxieties do not therefore rest upon the fear of the
unknown]{.underline}, i.e. the advent of disappearance, **[fears are
generated through a communicative assault which overloads the senses by
heightening the stakes of all appearances]{.underline}**.
[Indeed]{.underline}, since visual [representations of threat so
integral to future imaginaries have become globally networked
--]{.underline} hence effectively rendering localised drama greater
affective power than ordinarily afforded -- the visualization of all
[dangerous encounters becomes the power of the image combined in its
affects.]{.underline} [Everything in this visually internalised world is
connectable -- our fears included]{.underline}. We are reminded by Paul
Virilio\'s (2007) two regimes of fear. [Mapping out the distinctions
between totalitarian and liberal regimes, Virilio reveals some
disturbing connections]{.underline}. [While the former invokes paranoia
by working in the shadows]{.underline}, [the latter strikes at the same
senses through overexposure]{.underline}. The former, in other words,
stifles reality through repression and censorship, while the latter
overloads the imaginary in a frenzied assault so that we are anxiously
synchronised yet blinded to the attempted mastery of social space. [The
relationship to violence is particularly telling]{.underline}. While the
embodiment of totalitarian regimes is pre-figured in the 'disappeared'
-- those missing lives who offer no empirical verification of the
encounter -- [**liberal violence is virtuous**ly declared]{.underline}.
It takes place as an 'open event'. [It actively **shapes the world
anew** by 'making the world safer']{.underline}. Importantly, for
Virilio, these [affective relations are never simply articulated in a
linear, top-down fashion]{.underline}. [Like a networked system they
endlessly feed back: 'the synchronisation of sensations that are likely
to affect our decisions']{.underline} (Virilio 2010: 6). While the
problem of [terror has therefore become connectable with all manner of
everyday threats]{.underline}, [liberalism]{.underline} produces a
different regime of fear that [replaces the **neat tensions** of
sovereign (dis)order with the **paradox** of a bio-political
potentiality in which life itself always registers to be **greater than
the sum** of its epistemic parts. This will have a profound impact upon
both the spatial and the subject account of living systems]{.underline}.
Once notions of space are fully enclosed, nothing is epiphenomenal to
the order of things. [What terrifies actually emerges from within the
afflicted com- munity. It is integral to the modalities which sustain
life]{.underline}. It is therefore no coincidence to find that
contemporary accounts of terror demand environmental frames of reference
(Sloterdijk 2009). [Within a global imaginary of threat, we fear what we
actually produce]{.underline}. That is to say, [since what endangers
arises from within our living systems, what threatens is integral to
that existence]{.underline} (Virilio 2010). Not only does this imply
that [terror is]{.underline} necessarily indiscriminate. It is also
indiscriminable and [indistinguishable from the general
environment]{.underline} (Massumi 2009). [It precludes any prior
elimination of the fact on the basis that its sheer possibility
inaugurates its simulated occurrence]{.underline}. No longer then a
conventionally singular problem, [contemporary terrors register in the
multiple]{.underline}. [Anything can become the material source of our
physical undoing. With sequential notions of catastrophe as such firmly
displaced by an unending continuum of endemic crises, selective
auto-immunity is replaced by the demands for an auto-responsive logic
that strategically connects all things liveable]{.underline}. Since
[this invariably lends itself to preemptive forms of governance in which
all manner of threats blur into one strategic framework for
counter-affection]{.underline}, [the political is effectively
overwritten as the normalisation of threat foregrounds an account of
life already assumed to be settled]{.underline}. Faced with these
conditions, **[geo-strategic tensions appear to be mere
aberrations]{.underline}**. **[Arcane remnants of an outdated
past]{.underline}**! Not only does this mean that our sense of political
community transcends traditional state-centric demarcations, but [enmity
itself is radically transformed]{.underline}. As Michael Dillon and
Julian Reid note, 'Here, there is no Schmittean existential enemy
defined, in advance or by what Schmitt calls the miracle of decision, by
its radical otherness ... instead, only a continuously open and changing
field of formation and intervention: the very continuous and contingent
emergency of emergence of life as being-in-formation;
becoming-dangerous' (Dillon and Reid 2009: 44). This again is altogether
Kantian. While Kant proposed a life of infinite potentiality, life in
the process appeared infinitely problematic. The Kantian subject there-
fore not only finds its proper expression in our complex, adaptive and
emergent times, but the paradoxical nature of its potentiality has
redefined the security terrain so that indisrimination becomes the
default setting. This is perhaps what Deleuze had in mind when he
previously argued that [a 'global agreement on security' was 'just as
terrifying as war']{.underline}, for when our very life processes become
the source of our bio-political concerns, what Kenneth Galbreith once
termed [the 'contented society' is displaced by an Anxious Mass' who
fear the infinitely dangerous]{.underline}: [All our petty fears will be
organized in concert, **all our petty anxieties will be harnessed to
make micro-fascists of us; we will be called upon to stifle every little
thing, every suspicious face, every dissonant voice**]{.underline}.'
Whilst it is common to suggest that this dismantling of traditional
sovereign allegiance has resulted in a crisis of subjectivity -- to say
that the subject is in crisis misses the point. [Liberal
subjectivity]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [made real on account of its
ability to live]{.underline} through the ongoing emergency of its own
emergence. Eschewing fixed modes of being, it is forever in the making.
**[The liberal subject is therefore the subject of crises]{.underline}**
(Evans 2012). [It lives and breathes through the continual disruption to
its own static modes of recovery]{.underline}. None of this is
incidental. [It is central to paranoiac underpinnings of contemporary
forms of fascism]{.underline}. [While security has become the main
criteria of political legitimacy]{.underline} (Agamben 2001), still we
hold onto the belief that subjects of crises are desirable. [Freed from
the boundary-drawing constraints of the past, it is the riskembracing
subject who is enriched beyond their forbear\'s wildest
dreams.]{.underline} This reveals the fateful paradox of our times.
[Encoded with an altogether more powerful bodily trope, contemporary
liberal subjectivity is assumed to be exponentially more powerful and
dangerous because of it. It]{.underline}, too, [registers the same
dynamic, decentralised and]{.underline} [recombinant presumptions which
give risk societies their very meaning. If its allegiance, then, can no
longer be taken for granted, neither can its actions be anticipated with
absolute precision]{.underline}. It, too, operates beyond the epistemic
pale. [While planetary life is therefore seen to be the proper
embodiment of liberated political existence, life\'s emergent globality
renders it globally dangerous unto itself because of this
potentiality.]{.underline} We must in short learn to embrace and yet
fear what we have become.

### Imperalism DA

#### Notions of US legal prestige and modeling solidify global inequality by replacing political violence with legal violence 

\[Ugo **Mattei 2003**\] (A Theory of Imperial Law: A Study on U.S.

This essay attempts to develop [a theory of imperial law]{.underline}
that [is able to explain]{.underline} postCold War changes in [the
general process of Americanization in legal thinking]{.underline}. My
claim is that "imperial law" is now a dominant layer of world-wide legal
systems.1 Imperial law is produced, in the interest of international
capital, by a variety of both public and private institutions, all
sharing a gap in legitimacy, sometimes called the "democratic deficit."
[Imperial law is shaped by a **spectacular process of exaggeration,
aimed at building consent for the purpose of hegemonic
domination.**]{.underline} [Imperial law **subordinates local legal
arrangements** world-wide]{.underline}, reproducing on the global scale
the same phenomenon of legal dualism that thus far has characterized the
law of developing countries. [Predatory economic globalization is
the]{.underline} vehicle, the all-mighty [ally, and]{.underline} the
[beneficiary of imperial law.]{.underline} Ironically, [despite its
**absolute lack of democratic legitimacy**, imperial law imposes as a
natural necessity, by means of **discursive practices** branded
"**democracy and the rule of law**," a **reactive legal philosophy**
that outlaws redistribution of wealth based on social
solidarity.]{.underline}2 **[At the core of imperial law there is U.S.
law]{.underline}**, as transformed and adapted after the Reagan-Thatcher
revolution, in the process of **[infiltrating the]{.underline}** huge
**[periphery]{.underline}** left open after the end of the Cold War. A
study of imperial law requires a careful discussion of the factors of
penetration of U.S. legal consciousness world-wide, as well as a careful
distinction between the context of production and the context of
reception3 of the variety of institutional arrangements that make
imperial law. Factors of resistance need to be fully appreciated as
well. I. AMERICAN LAW: FROM LEADERSHIP TO DOMINANCE The years following
the Second World War have shown a dramatic change in the pattern of
world hegemony in the law. Leading legal ideas, once produced in
Continental Civilian Europe and exported through the periphery of the
world, are now for the first time produced in a common law jurisdiction:
the United States.4 There is little question that the present world
dominance of the United States has been economic, military, and
political first, and legal only in a more recent moment, so that a ready
explanation of legal hegemony can be found with a simple Marxist
explanation of law as a superstructure of the economy.5 Nevertheless,
the question of [the relationship between legal, political, and economic
hegemony is **not likely to be correctly addressed within a
cause-and-effect paradigm**]{.underline}.6 Ultimately, addressing this
question is a very important area of basic jurisprudential research
because it reveals some general aspects about the nature of law as a
device of global governance. Observing historical patterns of legal
hegemony allows us to critique the distinction between two main patterns
of governance through the law (and of legal transplants).7 Scholars of
legal transplants have traditionally distinguished two patterns. The
first is law as dominance without hegemony, in which the legal system is
ultimately a coercive apparatus asserting political and economic power
without consent. This area of inquiry and this model have been used to
explain the relationship between the legal system of the motherland and
that of the colonies within imperialistic colonial enterprises. The
opposing pattern, telling [a story of]{.underline} consensual [voluntary
reception by an admiring periphery of legal **models
developed**]{.underline} and provided for **[at the
center]{.underline}**, [is usually considered the most important pattern
of legal transplants. It is described by stressing on the idea of
consent within a notion of "prestige."]{.underline}8 Little effort is
necessary to challenge the sufficiency of this basic taxonomy in
introducing legal transplants. Law is a detailed and complex machinery
of social control that cannot function with any degree of effectiveness
without some cooperation from a variety of individuals staffing legal
institutions. These individuals usually consist of a professional elite
which either already exists or is created by the hegemonic power. Such
an elite provides the degree of consent to the reception of foreign
legal ideas that is necessary for any legal transplant to occur. Hence,
the distinction between imperialistic and non-imperialistic transplants
is a matter only of degree and not of structure. In order to understand
the nature of present legal hegemony, it is necessary to capture the way
in which the law functions to build a degree of consent to the present
pattern of international economic and political dominance.9 In this
essay I suggest that [a fundamental cultural construct of presumed
consent is the rhetoric of democracy and the rule of law utilized by the
imperial model of governance]{.underline}, 10 triumphant worldwide
together with the neo-American model of capitalism developed by the
Reagan and Thatcher revolution early in the 1980s. I argue that the last
twenty years have produced the triumph in global governance of reactive,
politically irresponsible institutions, such as the courts of law, over
proactive politically accountable institutions such as direct
administrative apparatuses of the State.11 This essay attempts to open a
radical revision of some accepted modes of thought about the law as they
appear today, at what has been called "the end of history."12 Its aim is
to discuss some ways in which global legality has been created in the
present stage of world-wide legal development. It will show how
[democracy and the rule of law]{.underline}, in the present legal
landscape, [are just another rhetoric of legitimization of a given
international dynamic of power]{.underline}. It will also denounce the
present unconscious state in which the law is produced and developed by
professional "consent building" elites. The consequences of such
unconsciousness are creating a legal landscape in which the law is
"naturally" giving up its role of constraining opportunistic behavior of
market actors. [This process results in the development of **faked rules
and institutions that are functional to the interests of**]{.underline}
the great **[capital and that dramatically enlarge inequality within
society]{.underline}**. I predict that **[such a legal environment is
unable to avoid tragic results on a global scale]{.underline}** such as
those outlined in the well-known parable of the tragedy of the
commons.13 My object of observation is a legal landscape in transition.
I wish to analyze this path of transition from one political setting
(the local state) to another political setting (world governance) in
which American-framed reactive institutions are asserting themselves as
legitimate and legitimating governing bodies, which I call imperial law.
Imperial law is the product of a renowned alliance between state and
economic institutions, a cooperative game in which a very limited number
of powerful players are at play.14 While in the ages of colonialism such
political battles for international hegemony were mostly carried on with
an open use of force and political violence (in such a way that final
extensive conflict between superpowers was unavoidable), **[in the age
of globalization and of economic Empire political violence has been
transformed into legal violence.]{.underline}**

### Micropolitics First

The world of becoming thereby is an ontologically flat world without the
traditional hierarchies of existence and a more shared conception of
agency. For Bennett, therefore, 'to begin to experience the relationship
between persons and other materialities more horizontally, is to take a
step toward a more ecological sensibility'.78 Here there is room for
human agency but this agency involves a deeper understanding of and
receptivity to the world of objects and object relations. [Rather than
the hubristic focus on transforming the external world, the
ethico-political tasks are those of work on the self to erase hubristic
liberal traces of subject-centric understandings, understood to merely
create the dangers of existential resentment. **Work on the self is the
only route to changing the world**]{.underline}. As Connolly states: 'To
embrace without deep resentment a world of becoming is to work to
"become who you are", so that the word "become" now modifies "are" more
than the other way around.' [Becoming who you are involves the
'microtactics of the self', and work on the self can then extend into
'micropolitics' of more conscious and reflective choices and decisions
and lifestyle choices leading to potentially higher levels of ethical
self-reflectivity and responsibility]{.underline}. Bennett argues that
against the 'narcissism' of anthropomorphic understandings of domination
of the external world, we need 'some tactics for cultivating the
experience of our selves as vibrant matter'. [Rather than hubristically
imagining that we can shape the world we live in,]{.underline} Bennett
argues that: 'Perhaps [the ethical responsibility of an individual human
now resides in one's response to the assemblages in which one finds
oneself participating]{.underline}. Such ethical tactics include
reflecting more on our relationship to what we eat and considering the
agentic powers of what we consume and enter into an assemblage with. In
doing so, if 'an image of inert matter helps animate our current
practice of aggressively wasteful and planet-endangering consumption,
then a materiality experienced as a lively force with agentic capacity
could animate a more ecologically sustainable public'. For new
materialists, [the object to be changed or transformed is the
human]{.underline} -- the human mindset. [By changing the way we think
about the world and the way we relate to it]{.underline} by including
broader, more non-human or inorganic matter in our considerations, [we
will have overcome our modernist 'attachment disorders' and have more
ethically aware approaches to our planet. In cultivating these new
ethical sensibilities, the human can be remade with a new self and a
'new self-interest'.]{.underline}

### Reps Matter

#### Representations of war occur through the language that we use to idealize war \-\-- the affirmative just mystifies war as a evil that never happens

\[John **Collins and** Ross **Glover 2002**\] (Collateral Language, p.
6-7, Assistant Prof. of Global Studies at St. Lawrence University,
Visiting Professor of Sociology at St. Lawrence University) xx-xx-2002
//pyrex ultra

As any university student knows, theories about the "social
con­struction" and social effects of language have become a common
feature of academic scholarship. [Conservative critics often argue that
those who use]{.underline} these [theories of language]{.underline}
(e.g., deconstruc­tion) [are "just" talking about language, as opposed
to]{.underline} talking about [the "real world."]{.underline} The essays
in this book, by contrast, begin from the premise that [language
**matters**]{.underline} in the most concrete, im­mediate way possible:
[its use, by political and military leaders, leads directly to violence
in the form of war]{.underline}, mass murder (in­cluding genocide), the
physical destruction of human commu­nities, and the devastation of the
natural environment. Indeed, [if the world ever witnesses a nuclear
holocaust, it will probably be because leaders]{.underline} in more than
one country have [succeeded in convincing their people, through the use
of political language, that the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline} and,
if necessary, the destruction of the earth itself, [is
justifiable]{.underline}. From our perspective, then, [every act of
political violence]{.underline}---from the horrors perpetrated against
Native Americans to the murder of political dissidents in the So­viet
Union to the destruction of the World Trade Center, and now the bombing
of Afghanistan---[is intimately linked with the use of
language.]{.underline} Partly what [we are talking about]{.underline}
here, of course, are the [processes of "manufacturing consent" and
shaping people's per­ception of the world around them]{.underline};
people are more likely to sup­port acts of violence committed in their
name if the recipients of the violence have been defined as
"terrorists," or if the violence is presented as a defense of "freedom."
Media analysts such as Noam Chomsky have written eloquently about the
corrosive ef­fects that this kind of process has on the political culture
of sup­posedly democratic societies. At the risk of stating the obvious,
however, the most fundamental effects of violence are those that are
visited upon the objects of violence; [the language that shapes public
opinion is the same language that burns villages, besieges entire
populations, kills and maims human bodies, and leaves the ground scarred
with bomb craters and littered with land mines.]{.underline} As George
Orwell so famously illustrated in his work, [acts of vio­lence can easily
be made more palatable through the use of eu­phemisms such as
"pacification"]{.underline} or, to use an example discussed in this
book, "targets." It is important to point out, however, that [the need
for such language derives from the simple fact that the violence itself

Notwithstanding the historic 2008 presidential election and the end of
the Bush administration, [neoliberal economics still represents a
powerful force in American life, particularly in its beliefs
that]{.underline} the common good should be coded as a pathology,
**[market rationality is the ultimate]{.underline}** embodiment of
[**freedom**, and]{.underline}, in spite of our current credit and
financial crises, [the future is best understood as a **shortterm
investment** defined by the bottom line.]{.underline} In spite of the
threat of an economic meltdown, President [Bush]{.underline}, just
[before leaving]{.underline} office, [acted as if the regime of
neoliberal capitalism was the only legitimate way to
address]{.underline} the very [crisis]{.underline} it had created.
Shortly before the heads of the Group of 20 met in Washington near the
end of 2008 for a summit on the global financial crisis, [Bush gave a
speech in which he]{.underline} once again [affirmed his ideological
loyalty to]{.underline} predatory [capitalism and its illusory
**free-market wonders.**]{.underline} First, [he provided mindless
praise for the]{.underline} very [market fundamentalism that produced
global market turmoil with]{.underline} his [unapologetic
boast]{.underline}, "I'm a market-oriented guy."22 Second, seemingly
clueless about the nature of the worldwide financial crisis, [he
proffered what sounded like a joke from]{.underline} Comedy Central's
The Daily Show, hosted by [Jon Stewart, insisting that "\[t\]he great
threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement
in the market. It is too much government involvement in the
market."]{.underline}23 In short, [Bush repeated what has
become]{.underline} an element of [common sense in the public
mind---that the market rather than politics gives people what they want.
There is more at work here than the rallying cry of hard-line market
fundamentalists, many of whom have been appointed]{.underline} to
high-level [cabinet positions in the Obama administration. There
is]{.underline} also [the presupposition that **free-markets alone
should provide for the welfare** of human beings]{.underline},
suggesting not only an attack on the social state and a government
willing to intervene on behalf of its citizens but also a notion of
governing in which social needs are subordinated to economic interests.
According to neoliberal economic policies, the welfare of human beings
should be handed over to market forces, a presupposition that empties
out the very constitutive nature of politics and the crucial realm of
the social. But more is at risk here than the emptying out of politics:
[there are also the ravaging effects of a market fundamentalism that
causes massive disparities in wealth and power]{.underline} along with
the [weakening of worker protections and the destruction of the social
state]{.underline}, all of which are legitimated through a self-serving
historical reinvention in which the success of politics is measured by
the degree to which it evades any sense of social responsibility and
public commitment. In this case, [corporate sovereignty not only makes
power invisible, it also **conveniently erases** a history of barbaric
**greed**, unconscionable economic **inequity**, scandal-plagued
politics, resurgent **monopolies**, and an unapologetic
**racism.**]{.underline}24 What is often ignored by many theorists who
analyze the rise of [neoliberalism in the United States is]{.underline}
that it is not only a system of economic power relations but also a
political project, [intent on producing **new forms of subjectivity**
and sanctioning particular modes of conduct.]{.underline}25 In
addressing the absence of what can be termed the cultural politics and
public pedagogy of neoliberalism, I want to begin with a theoretical
insight provided by the British media theorist Nick Couldry, who insists
that "every system of cruelty requires its own theater," [one that draws
upon the **rituals of everyday life** in order to legitimate its norms,
values, institutions, and social practices.]{.underline}26
[Neoliberalism represents one]{.underline} such [system of cruelty that
is **reproduced**]{.underline} daily **[through]{.underline}** a regime
of common sense and [a narrow notion of **political rationality** that
"reaches from the soul of the citizen-subject to educational policy to
practices of empire."]{.underline}27 What is new about neoliberalism in
the last three decades is that it has become normalized---even
celebrated by the dominant media---and now serves as a powerful
pedagogical force that shapes our lives, memories, and daily
experiences, while attempting to erase everything critical and
emancipatory about history, justice, solidarity, freedom, and the
meaning of democracy. Undoubtedly, neoliberal norms, practices, and
social relations are being called into question to a degree unwitnessed
since the 1970s. Yet despite the devastating impact of a financial
Katrina, [neoliberalism's potent **market-driven rationality** is far
from bankrupt and is still a powerful **economic, cultural, and
political force** to be reckoned with]{.underline}

Scepticism toward invocations of 'we' and 'us' often arises
from misinterpreting we-statements as sociological statements requiring
a concrete, delineable, empirical
referent. [The]{.underline} misinterpretation is an [effect of
the erasure of the division necessary for politics]{.underline} as if
interest and will were only and automatically attributes of a **fixed
social position**. As a consequence, sceptics neglect the performative
component of the first-person plural, overlooking the point where, as
Žižek puts it, 'objective social analysis breaks down and a subjective
political attitude directly inscribes itself' (2010: 203). The power of
Occupy, a power expressed in the slogan, 'We are the 99 per cent,' arose
out of such a direct inscription of a political attitude, the
inscription of a political subject. No one thought that 99 per cent of
the people in the US were actually saying 'we'. The slogan was not an
empirical claim; it was a political representation. For some in Occupy,
often but not always adopting an anarchist position, 'we' is a problem
because it posits an impossible unity. They assume that first-person
plural statements imply uniformity across the entirety of the group (and
here they sneak in some of their sceptical allies' reductive empiricism,
as if groups or collectives designated via the first-person plural were
necessary outgrowths of fixed social positions). This argument is weak
because there is no reason to assume such a unity.In4sofar as a 'we' can
be constituted through the mutual recognition of 'you' and 'I', 'we'
begins from, is premised on, constitutive difference (Dean 1996). That
we differ and disagree doesn't mean we aren't us. It's not necessary to
assume that 'we' are all the same or that 'we' always agree.
Unfortunately, some individualist tendencies in the occupation movement
failed to recognise that 'we' can and always does include difference and
so needlessly fetishised an individualism belied by the collective power
at the heart of Occupy Wall Street. A basic tenet of psychoanalysis is
that [the individual subject is constitutively divided.]{.underline} On
this point, [the collective subject is no different. It]{.underline},
too, [is constituted out of diverging]{.underline} tendencies, [affects,
fantasies]{.underline}, thoughts, [desires]{.underline}, practices [and
influences. ]{.underline}It, too, struggles through change and changes
through struggle. In politics a 'we' is uttered in opposition to a
'they' -- it's us and them. '[We' excludes. But
this]{.underline} opposition [is]{.underline} not an argument against
the first-person plural. **It's **[a point in its favour. Rather than
remaining confined by the inclusivist]{.underline} presumptions
of [post-politics, leftists should]{.underline}** embrace** the
first-person plural and [accept exclusion: some positions are wrong and
should]{.underline}

[There is]{.underline} deep [anger]{.underline} and disgust [with
the]{.underline} political [status quo]{.underline} in the United
States. The Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter, the heroic pipeline
struggles in North Dakota, and the thirteen million people who voted for
Bernie Sanders have unearthed that to the world. When systemic problems
become too large to ignore, when socialists start gaining millions of
votes, for example, or when black people riot and rebel in the streets,
the news media is forced to provide some explanation. And in doing so,
they typically give us fractured glimpses of reality. But rarely do they
piece together the entire picture. Consider four separate news stories
from last year. The first is the continuing crisis of the opioid
addiction crisis in this country. There are two million people addicted
to opioids in the United States, a disproportionate number of whom are
white. From 2009 to 2014, almost half a million people have died from
opioid overdoses, a fourfold increase since 1999. A second story,
briefly in the news, reported on the decline in life expectancy for
white women. It is unprecedented for life expectancy to reverse in a
so-called first-world country. In the United States peer countries, life
expectancy is actually growing. Why is life expectancy for working-class
white women in decline? Drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol abuse. In
Chicago, the story has been the rise in shootings and murders in the
city's working-class black neighborhoods. In 2016, there were 4,379
people shot in Chicago, and 797 people killed. The overwhelmingly
majority of both were African-American. The news media's nonsensical
explanations for the violence include retaliation. But that is only
matched by the nonsense offered by elected officials, which includes the
absence of role models and poor parenting. What is almost never offered
as at least part of the answer is how Chicago has the highest black
unemployment rate of the nation's five largest cities at 25 percent,
that nearly half of black men aged 20 to 24 are neither in school nor
employed, that Chicago has the third-highest poverty rate of large
cities in the US, and that it is the most segregated city in the
country. Finally, there is the story of the shrinking of the so-called
middle class. In the 1970s, 61 percent of Americans fell into that vague
but stable category. Today, that number has fallen to 50 percent. It is
driven by the growing wealth inequality that exists in this country. In
the last year alone, the one percent saw their income rise by seven
percent, and the .1 percent saw their income rise by 9 percent. In
general, [the richest 20]{.underline} [percent]{.underline} of US
households [own 84 percent of the wealth in this country, while the
bottom 40 percent own less than one percent]{.underline}. The media
would have us believe that this is a story primarily about the Rust Belt
and disgruntled white workers. In fact, it is also a story about 240,000
black homeowners, who lost their houses to foreclosures in the last
eight years. It is also a story about urban school closures and the
decimation of employment for black educators. Thousands of black
teachers have been fired in the last decade. These four prominent
stories reported on over the last several years are often told
separately, reinforcing the perception that different groups of ordinary
people in this country live in their own world and have experiences that
are wholly separate from each other. But what would happen [if we
put]{.underline} these [stories together]{.underline}, [and told them as
a single narrative]{.underline} about life in this country? If we told
them together, [it could allow us]{.underline} [to see]{.underline} that
[the anxieties, stresses,]{.underline} confusions, and frustrations
[about]{.underline} [life]{.underline} world today [are not owned by one
group, but are shared by many.]{.underline} It would not tell us that
everyone suffers the same oppression, but it would allow us to see that
even if we don't experience a particular kind of oppression, every
working person in this country is going through something. Everyone is
trying to figure out how to survive, and many are failing. If we put
these stories together, we would gain more insight into how ordinary
[[white people have as much stake]{.underline}]{.mark} in the fight for
a different kind of society [as anyone else]{.underline}. [We
wouldn't]{.underline} so casually [dismiss their suffering as privilege,
because [they do not suffer as much as black and brown people]{.mark} in
this country.]{.underline} In fact, we might find that the privileges of
white skin run very thin in a country where nineteen million white
people languish in poverty. Apparently, the wages of whiteness are not
so great that they can stop millions of ordinary white people from
literally drinking and drugging themselves to death, to escape the
despair of living in this "greatest country on earth." If we put these
separate stories into a single story, we could make better sense of why
socialism is rising in popularity, why people have taken to the streets
over the last six years to protest the growing and racial and economic
inequality. There are 400 billionaires in this country. They are the
reason why there are forty-seven million poor people. You cannot have
untold, obscene wealth unless you have untold, obscene poverty. That is
the law of the free market. And [how does this]{.underline} parasitic
[[one percent]{.underline}]{.mark} of the population [[hold onto their
wealth when we are so many]{.mark}?]{.underline} Racism**[, [immigrant
bashing, homophobia, transphobia, sexism,
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [[they get us to fight each
other]{.mark} while they hoard their wealth]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} they [keep our stories separate]{.underline} from each
other, [so that we never understand the entire story]{.underline},
[only]{.underline} [our]{.underline} particular [part]{.underline} of
it. [But knowledge]{.underline} alone [of]{.underline} the existence of
[racism]{.underline}, inequality, poverty, [and injustice does not
equip]{.underline} with [our side with the]{.underline} political [tools
needed to]{.underline} fight the battles of today or [fight for a
socialist future]{.underline}. We need struggle, but [we]{.underline}
also [need politics]{.underline}, because we must contend with a
political establishment that wants to lower our expectations, to believe
that this existing society is the best that we can expect from humanity.
Hillary Clinton ran a campaign of low expectations, a campaign that
cynically pivoted around the notion that ordinary people shouldn't ask
for too much. For all the excitement that Bernie Sanders' campaign
generated for rightly demanding more, his commitment to remaining in the
Democratic Party then threatens to neuter his political revolution.
Expecting the Democratic Party to fight for the democratic
redistribution of wealth and resources in this country is like expecting
to squeeze orange juice out of an apple. It is impossible. We must build
independent organizations and political parties that are not connected
to the Democratic Party, or that rise and fall with each electoral
cycle. We have to build organizations that are democratic, multiracial,
and militant, with a foundation in solidarity. "[Solidarity"
meaning]{.underline} that [even if you don't experience a
particular]{.underline} oppression, it doesn't matter,
[because]{.underline} you understand that as ordinary people, [our fates
are tied together]{.underline}, and [that [one]{.underline} [group's
liberation is dependent upon the liberation of all]{.underline}]{.mark}
the oppressed and exploited. Another world is possible. Another United
States is possible, but only if we organize and fight for it. In
closing, I want to quote from a note that was taped to the front door of
my son Ellison's daycare center on Inauguration Day. It said simply: "Do
not despair. Eyes wide open. Strength in numbers. Keep the faith. And
stay strong."

### Vampirism DA

#### Vampiricism-The empathy of the affirmative is vampiricism -- the focus on suffering due to removing aid becomes another marketable neoliberal development tool that calcifies unending Western kindness 

\[Carolyn **Pedwell 2012**\] ("Affective (self-) transformations:
Empathy, neoliberalism and international development," Newcastle
University, UK, *Feminist Theory* 13(2): 163--179) xx-xx-2012 //pyrex
ultra

Empathy, self-transformation and power What my analysis of the
literature on immersions throws up, therefore, is the possibility that
[empathetic self-transformation functions less to produce
more]{.underline} [intersubjective relations and ways of knowing, than
it does to augment the moral and affective capacities of development
professionals]{.underline}. Immersions are explicitly linked throughout
the international development literature with processes of 'professional
development', 'internal capacity building', 'recruitment', 'staff
selection', solving 'institutional problems' and even creating 'pro-poor
elites' (Hilgers, 2007: 24). Indeed, [within the neoliberal context in
which international development operates, empathy can become an
**emotional skill or capacity**]{.underline} [with both **institutional
and market value.**]{.underline} As Swan argues, as a result of the
neoliberal 'emotionalisation of society' in North America, Western
Europe and Australia, '[emotional expressivity' is perceived as
']{.underline}a new workplace resource with the intensification of
''[soft capitalism'' and its demands for emotional and aesthetic
labour]{.underline} from a range of types and levels of workers' (2008:
89). Yet, the risk is that [while the affective capacities and skills of
development staff can be cultivated, honed and tested through
immersions, the]{.underline} poor 'third world' '**[other' remains
simply the object of empathy]{.underline}** and thus once again fixed in
place. In this respect, **[it is telling]{.underline}** -- [if not
surprising]{.underline} -- [that, while]{.underline} the twists and
turns of [the affective journeys experienced by development officials
are described in significant depth, there is **comparatively little
exploration** of the feelings of their hosts]{.underline}. The voices of
[immersion]{.underline} hosts that are highlighted in the special issue
are largely ones that express emotion in the form of gratitude to their
guests for listening to them and caring about their lives (see, for
example, Hilgers, 2007). As such, **[hosts are not depicted as
cultivating empathy themselves]{.underline}**, [nor are they heard to
articulate anger, resentment, frustration, or envy. The implication is
that poor people's efforts to generate means of basic subsistence for
their families mean that they do not have **time or need for affective
life**]{.underline}, [but also that it is inconsequential whether or not
they experience emotional journeys.]{.underline} In this context,
feminist questions regarding the possibilities of mutual or dialogic
empathetic engagement across social and geopolitical boundaries are
salient (Bartky, 1996; Koehn, 1998; Pedwell, 2010). [This]{.underline}
[strand of international development discourse seems to provide yet
another example wherein **empathy functions as a capacity of those who
are already privileged.**]{.underline} It is also revealing that while
the language of 'responsibility' is used throughout the literature on
immersions, **[there is no explicit recognition of
complicity]{.underline}**. That is, while immersions are understood to
enable an affective journey on the part of development professionals
leading to a recognition of individual responsibility, there is actually
little acknowledgement in these texts that development practitioners
themselves are located within the transnational relations of power in
which poverty persists, nor that immersions may in fact be complicit in
perpetuating such hierarchies. [When 'responsibility' is
referenced]{.underline}, it [is in fact the responsibility of 'others'
for propagating injustice and poverty]{.underline} -- not those involved
in contemporary development practice themselves. Thus, in Chambers'
quote cited earlier, the repetition of the phrase 'those responsible'
indicates clearly that complicity for the legacy of suffering 'inflicted
on the poor by structural adjustment' is to be located elsewhere (2007:
14). As in other mainstream discourses of 'participatory development',
there is little taking account here of the material histories and
discursive coding that make 'our' encounters with and representations of
'the subaltern' inevitably loaded (Spivak, 1988; Kapoor, 2004). [This is
a key point where the development literature on immersions diverges from
the **feminist and anti-racist literatures on empathy**]{.underline}. In
these texts, acknowledgement of complicity is essential to any form of
empathetic engagement with the potential to play a role in radically
disrupting existing power relations. **[Neoliberal
empathy]{.underline}**? [The impact of all of this becomes significant
on a global scale when we consider how immersions are becoming
institutionalised as 'good practice' within the international aid
apparatus]{.underline}. Throughout the special issue, [neoliberal
rhetoric is employed to position immersions as productive as well as
'cost-effective']{.underline} (Chambers, 2007: 14). Professionals who
participate in immersions are referred to by institutions who offer
these programmes as 'clients' who are making an 'investment' in learning
and 'capacity building', and for whom 'customised schedules' may be
produced (Hilgers, 2007: 22). Furthermore, [the spectrum of institutions
offering immersions is expanding and now includes a range of
nongovernmental organisations, including local micro-finance
lenders]{.underline}, [which employ immersions for a variety of
institutional reasons and through which they accumulate both social and
economic capital.]{.underline} As such, it is now becoming possible to
speak of a [transnational 'immersions industry' operating within the
international humanitarian 'compassion economy']{.underline} (Caple
James, 2010). [Thus, while feminists and other critical scholars have
emphasised the fluidity and unpredictability of emotion and
affe]{.underline}ct, the assumption here is that **[emotion and
affective relations can be regulated, packaged, and even
measured]{.underline}**. [In fixing categories of 'empathiser' and
'sufferer' in this way, **immersions may be more likely to reify** and
extend **dominant social and geopolitical inequalities** and exclusions
than they are to **disrupt or ameliorate them**]{.underline}.

### Assimilation DA

#### Complete rejection of the AFF is necessary- historically, feminist voices and movements have failed to bring about change when working within the dominant organizations- must refuse to assimilate and challenge the structure from opposing viewpoints

Structure in the White House: The Office of Women\'s Initiatives and
Outreach", Source: Political Research Quarterly, Vol. 56, No. 4 (Dec.,

[Certainly, women have made substantial gains in the executive branch,
both in numbers and seniority. The mas- culinized structure of the EOP
does not preclude women from competing and winning budgets, title, and
office space.]{.underline} In fact, there are more women serving in the
EOP today than ever. The most recent study of women in the WHO indicates
that 39 percent of White House staff are women (Tenpas 1997). **[Despite
such gains, however, women have generally been denied access to the
president\'s inner-circle.]{.underline}** Those in top positions, with
the titles, budgets, office, and staff have been absent from the table.
A former senior White House aide during the Reagan administration noted
that although she saw very little overt sexism during her tenure, she
also felt that \"there\'s very much a barefoot-in-the-kitchen mental-
ity in the White House\" (Romano 1986: Dl). Further, Tenpas (1997: 95)
observed that **[women the most senior titles and a greater degree of
access to the president,\" but that they were not as influential as
their male counterparts may have obtained \" who possess similar
titles.]{.underline}** These observations of the EOP are consistent with
those of feminist organizational theorists who contend that state
organizations are dominated by a male culture of hierarchy and
competition. Further, they are consistent with theories of new
institutionalists who suggest that **[the EOP is unlikely to change as
long as it remains a dominant, highly centralized and hierarchical
organization]{.underline}**. Still, the Clinton administra- tion took an
unprecedented step by establishing the Office for Women\'s Initiatives
and Outreach and by giving its first direc- tor the freedom to
experiment with a new organizational style from within the confines of
the larger organization. In the next part of the paper, we analyze the
unique case that the OWIO provides for exploring the influence of gender
on a political institution, especially the influence of gender on the
EOP Although this new agency with feminist structure and management
strategies initially thrived, theory suggests that the experiment would
ultimately fail at making permanent structural change or remaining
intact for very long. did not conform to the style of the EOP, so the
office isomor- phically changed to mirror the organization with greater
resources, greater centralization, and less ambiguity In fact, if Myers
had remained director of the OWIO instead of resign- ing after the 1996
election, it is highly likely that she would have conformed to the
traditional EOP management style in time. Indeed, the fact that she
opted to resign because the office was not elevated to a stand-alone
office in the EOP hier- archy, indicates that she may have been willing
to sacrifice the unique organizational structure for the structure
adopted by the larger organization and the presidents inner circle.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This case study of the OWIO allows us to
observe the strength of isomorphic pressure and to make conclusions
about the ability of feminist organizations to exist within the state.
[By combining feminist theory and cultural theories of institutions, we
have shown that a masculine organizational culture permeates the
structure and processes of the EOP and that this culture ultimately
shaped the success of the OWIO]{.underline}. On the one hand, new
institutionalism helped us explain why the OWIO reorganized and modeled
itself after the larger and more dominant EOP; while on the other hand,
feminist organizational analysis explained how that adaptation led to
failure. [Radical feminists claim that there is ultimately no room for
experimentation with egalitarian and non-bureaucratic forms of
organization within normal bureaucratic discourse]{.underline}. Ferguson
(1984: 73) contends that [only self-supporting feminist organizations
can sustain themselves as strong organizations: Since the bureaucratic
world controls the distribution of crucial resources (grants, loans,
contracts) alternative organ- izations, if they are not self-supporting,
frequently must seek entry into discursive relations with bureaucracies
in order to survive]{.underline} . . . The goals of the organization
become increasingly focused on the maintenance of the flow of resources
that bureaucratic discourse makes available, and the discourse of
egalitarianism dies. More specifically, **[she argues that feminist
organizations \"cease to carry any critical edge\" when they attempt to
work within masculinist bureaucratic organizations]{.underline}** (181).
[Although she notes that individual feminists may survive in this
environment with their commitment intact, **they will not succeed in
altering the dominant bureaucratic discourse in a feminist direction
(**]{.underline}191). Grant and Tancred (1992) similarly argue that
[women\'s and feminist organizations tend to be powerless and isolated
units within large state bureaucracies, rarely influencing the dominant
institution]{.underline}. Myers, Haynes, Luray, and the OWIO staff were
all com- mitted feminists, but their attempt to turn presidential
attention toward women\'s issues beyond an election year ultimately
failed. The connection to women\'s organizations outside the White House
and across the country was sustained during Myers\' tenure. However,
once Clinton failed to for- mally recognize the success of this unique
experiment, by elevating the office from an isolated subunit to a more
pow- erful stand-alone unit, the OWIO lost its momentum. After the 1996
election was secured with an 11 percent gender gap, it appears that the
Clinton White House turned its attention away from women\'s issues and
refocused their efforts elsewhere. Haynes and Luray made an attempt to
capture presidential attention by getting closer to the EOP in both
physical proximity and management style. But, [our feminist
organizational analysis suggests that this strategy may have backfired.
Rather than gaining presidential atten- tion by becoming \"\'one of the
boys,\" the OWIO became more invisible while modeling EOP structure and
style]{.underline}. Clinton\'s creation of the OWIO was still an
important step for those interested in hearing a feminine voice from the
White House. Additionally, it was a critical step for those of us
interested in studying the gendered nature of the EOP As noted, the OWIO
was the first formally organized office dealing with women\'s issues
inside the White House. The experiment brought a form of feminist
discourse to the White House for the first time. Although the venture
was not wholly successful, we were able to observe a feminist
organization thrive inside the EOP when given the auton- omy to
experiment with structure and style. We were also able to explore the
contours of isomorphic organizational change within gendered
organizations. Our analysis leads us to two sets of conclusions-one for
those who design executive branch reorganizations and the other for
feminists seeking governmental action. First, pres- idents interested in
women\'s issues should carefully review the gendered nature of the
reorganization plans they bring to the White House. **[Reorganization
and reform of the EOP have been and continue to be couched in a
masculine voice]{.underline}**. Although the Brownlow Committee\'s
report instigated a comprehensive set of reforms for administrative
design of the executive, those **[reforms have typically germinated in
the field of public administration where bureaucratic efficiency is the
goal]{.underline}**. Thus, **[the reforms we have seen in the
EOP]{.underline}** are laden with attempts to create efficiency and
effectiveness by reducing staff size, enhancing use of cabinet and
career civil servants, and tightening the hierarchical circle around the
president, thereby **[continuing the voice of the dominant male
culture.]{.underline}** In order to transform political and policy out-
comes presidents, administrative transition teams need to support
initiatives, like the OWIO, that are suited for a dif- ferent form of
organizational and management culture. Second, feminists should not be
discouraged by OWIO\'s failure to survive. Although President George W
Bush reor- ganized the EOP when he took office, abolishing the OWIO and
creating the Office of Faith-Based and Community Ini- tiatives, the OWIO
provides the first record of a successful feminist experiment inside the
White House. An office that made consensus-based decisions, networked
with women\'s groups and used non-hierarchical management techniques,
met with some success for more than two years. Even though the office
became relatively invisible by 1997, the OWIO helped to make power
visible by providing a feminist example for future study and design. The
OWIO laid the groundwork for further understanding of the feminine
organization within in the state apparatus. It is only through this kind
of analysis that we can consider similar forms of organization

[Despite the clear trends indicating a reduction in both the amount and
quality of postsecondary education available to welfare recipients,
according to the mainstream media and both major political parties,
welfare reform is deemed a resounding success.]{.underline} This is due
in large part to the fact that [**conventional policy analyses focus on
outcomes that are important to the state**, rather than outcomes that
are important in the lives of women.]{.underline} As the Applied
Research Center points out in a recent review of the literature (2001),
[mainstream policy analysts consistently fail to address quality of life
issues when evaluating welfare reform, such as the ability to obtain
living-wage jobs, to find adequate and affordable child care, or to
access education and training to insure career development. Instead,
most existing research focuses on the degree to which welfare rolls have
been reduced or traces experiences within the labor market without
examining the role that gender or race may have on employment outcomes
(]{.underline}Applied Research Center, 2001). Thus, while welfare reform
is considered successful when judged by the 50% reduction in caseloads,
[the success of this policy is far more questionable when judged by a
different set of outcomes---outcomes that are more meaningful to the
quality of life for the women affected]{.underline} by these policies.
Access to postsecondary education is a prime example of this. **[There
exists clear and convincing evidence that education is a critical factor
in insuring long-term employment stability and self-sufficiency for poor
women]{.underline}**. In a study of 4500 working mothers, Spalter-Roth
and Hartmann (1991) found that a college degree increases hourly wages
by \$3.65 when compared with the wages of high-school graduates.
Moreover, women receiving welfare who achieved a bachelor's degree are
far more likely to be employed 10 years after graduation than women who
did not receive a degree (Gittell et al., 1990). A 1997 survey of AFDC
recipients in Maine revealed that as the level of formal education
increases, so too does the percentage of women employed and their median
hourly wage. Whereas only 20% of those with a high-school diploma or GED
were employed, 89% of those with a bachelor's degree had found work
(Seguino & Butler, 1998).

#### Success will [still]{.underline} be decided by powerful white males, it [fails]{.underline} to empower women.

[By nearly all accounts in the mainstream media, welfare reform is
portrayed as a resounding success]{.underline}. Bill Clinton, who signed
the legislation in 1996, has pointed to it as one of his greatest
achievements, and current President George W. Bush is touting it as an
American success story, eagerly embracing the "success" of the
work-first ideology by attempting to increase the work requirements to
forty hours a week. If such a bill is passed, forty states are likely to
further cut access to postsecondary education and training to avoid
financial penalties (Center for Law and Social Policy, 2002).
[**Virtually no one is questioning this analysis of welfare reform,** in
large part because the only outcome that has received any real attention
is the reduction in welfare rolls]{.underline}, which have dropped by as
much as 60% in some states (Applied Research Center, 2001). [**When
measured by this seemingly objective outcome, welfare reform can indeed
be viewed as a success.** Yet the picture is quite different when
welfare reform is analyzed through the lens of feminist critical policy
analysis. Economic self-sufficiency, rather than moving off the welfare
rolls, is a more appropriate policy goal for poor women, and obtaining
adequate education and training is the surest route to long-term
economic stability]{.underline}. If welfare reform is measured against
this standard, its success is surely called into question, since access
to postsecondary education has dropped dramatically, [1/4 of former
welfare recipients live in poverty, and the poorest women became poorer
following welfare reform]{.underline} (Sherman, 1998). Women who receive
welfare are not, by and large, able to pursue education and training,
and those who do have a tenuous hold on the educational process.
Moreover, the type of education available to welfare recipients is
short-term and nontransferable, a fact that renders it far less useful
than more traditional forms of education. [Using feminist critical
policy analysis, I have engaged in an exercise to illustrate how policy
formation and implementation can be understood as a series of
disconnects between policymakers and mainstream analysts and the
individuals whose lives are most affected by the policy]{.underline}.
[Utilizing welfare reform as a case study of broad social policy and its
effects on access to higher education, this analytical lens has clearly
revealed the ways in which various elements of policy can create
particularly onerous barriers to education and training for poor women.
Elements of formal policy clearly create enormous barriers to education.
Limits on the amount and type of education available, an emphasis on
rapid employment, lifetime limits on the receipt of welfare, and lack of
access to child care create barriers to education so high that most
women receiving welfare cannot overcome them.]{.underline} Yet equally
important is the policy implementation process. The informal elements of
policy in action, such as the ways in which caseworkers, states and
educational institutions respond to the policy with specific practices,
can also erect enormous barriers to education. When combined, then,
formal policy and informal elements of welfare policy implementation
create a web of obstructions to education. In large part, [these
barriers are exacerbated because policymakers and implementers are blind
to the unique context of the lives of poor, single mothers. And many of
these barriers are simply not visible when welfare reform is examined
using more conventional modes of policy analysis.]{.underline} This
article utilizes welfare reform as a case study in employing feminist
critical policy analysis to policy that affects access to postsecondary
education. [As I hope my analysis has illustrated, this methodological
and analytical tool provides a potential corrective to more traditional
analyses of policy in general, and higher education policy in
particular. This framework is self-consciously anchored by questions of
whether particular policies will empower and democratize
women]{.underline} (Kahne, 1994). As such, [it is an analytical
perspective that allows policy researchers to place gender at the center
of analyses, and it allows as well the development of democratizing
solutions]{.underline} to current policy conundrums (Marshall, 1999).

## Perm \-\-- Militarism

### Integration DA

#### The permutation is a politics of integration within imaginative geography that justifies violence 

\[David **Campbell 2007**\] (Political Geography 26.4, ScienceDirect,
Int'l Boundaries Research At Durham) xx-xx-2007 //pyrex ultra

In the aftermath of September the 11th it has become commonplace to
argue that the world has fundamentally changed. President Bush claimed
as much when he declared the attacks of that day meant "the doctrine of
containment just doesn\'t hold any water" and the strategic vision of
the US had to shift dramatically (Bush, 2003). As a result, integration
-- into a western and American set of values and modus operandi -- has
become the new strategic concept. Distinct from the superficial binaries
of the Cold War, **[integration]{.underline}** nonetheless **[involves
its own set of exclusions, with forms of violence awaiting those who are
either unwilling or unable to be incorporated.]{.underline}** This paper
has traced the emergence of integration as the basis for the imaginative
geography of the 'war on terror'. It has done so by maintaining that
**[the production of this imaginative geography should be understood in
terms of performance rather than construction. That is because we are
dealing with an assemblage of practices -- state policy, 'non-state
scribes' and the representational technologies of popular geopolitics --
which together produce the effect they name, stabilizing over time to
produce a series of spatial formations through the performance of
security.]{.underline}** Given the manner in which
**[this]{.underline}** emergent **[imaginative geography has
materialized in the invasion and occupation of Iraq]{.underline}** --
which was carried out in the name of terror and has created the very
terror it named -- **[it is clear when we speak of performance we are
dealing with much more than just thinking, writing or speaking
differently.]{.underline}** Yet in practice the materialization of such
strategies and imaginations has rarely been straightforward. In fact, in
many instances the opposite of the intention has been created. We could
point, for example, to the ways in which 'territorial integrity' was
repeatedly mobilized as a war-aim in the invasion of Iraq and yet the
consequence has been the creation of a state which is unable to protect
its borders, cannot project its power effectively within them and is in
danger of fragmentation into ethnically or religiously created regions
(Elden, 2007). **[The self-serving apologetics of many of those
integrally involved in the framing of such policies]{.underline}** --
Barnett (2005) and Fukuyama (2006), for two -- indeed **[indicate the
resilience of the imaginaries we describe, clear and present failures
notwithstanding; it is not that they got things wrong, for the basic
analysis still holds -- it only needs to be enacted more
effectively.]{.underline}**

So far, I have offered only a way of thinking about responsibility in
general. One might well object that the social connection model of
responsibility raises as many questions as it answers. For example, the
model says that [all who participate by their actions in processes that
produce injustice share responsibility for its remedy.]{.underline} Does
this mean that all participants bear responsibility in the same way and
to the same degree? If not, then [what are the grounds for
differentiating kinds and degrees of responsibility?]{.underline} Most
of us participate in many structural processes, more- over, that
arguably have disadvantaging, harmful, or unjust consequences for
others. It is asking too much to expect most of us to work actively to
restructure each and every one of the structural injustices for which we
arguably share responsibility. [How]{.underline}, then, [should we
**reason about the best ways** to use our **limited time, resources, and
creative energy** to respond to structural injustice?]{.underline}
Adequately responding to questions like these would take at least
another full essay. Thus, I will only sketch answers here, and
illustrate the responses once again through the example of the
anti-sweatshop movement. Some moral theorists argue that responsibility
names a form of obligation distinct from duty. Joel Feinberg, for
example, distinguishes between an ethic that focuses on obligation or
duty and an ethic that focuses on responsibility. On the one hand, a
duty specifies a rule of action or delineates the substance of what
actions count as performing the duty. [A responsibility]{.underline}, on
the other hand, [while no less obligatory, is more open with regard to
what counts as carrying it out.]{.underline}49 A person with
responsibilities is obliged to attend to outcomes that the
responsibilities call for, and to orient her actions in ways
demonstrably intended to contribute to bringing about those outcomes.
Because a person may face many moral demands on her actions, and because
changes in circumstances are often unpredictable, just how a person goes
about discharging her responsibilities is a matter subject to
considerable discretion.5° [Given that **a combination of
responsibilities may be overly demanding**]{.underline}, and given that
agents have discretion in how they choose to discharge their
responsibilities, [it is reasonable to say that it is up to each agent
to decide what she can and should do under the circumstances, and how
she should order her moral priorities.]{.underline} Others have the
right to question and criticize our decisions and actions, however,
especially when we depend on one another to perform effective collective
action. [Part of what it means to be responsible on the social
connection model is to be]{.underline} accountable to others with whom
one shares responsibility---**[accountable for what one has decided to
do and for which structural injustices one has chosen to
address]{.underline}**. [When an agent is able to give an account of
what she has done,]{.underline} and why, in terms of shared
responsibilities for structural injustice, then [others usually ought to
accept her decision and the way she sets priorities for her
actions]{.underline}. These considerations begin to provide an answer to
the question I stated above, namel how should one reason about the best
way to use one's limited time and resources to respond to structural
injustices? In a world with many and deep structural injustices[, most
of us, in principle, share more responsibility **than we can reasonably
be expected to discharge.**]{.underline}5' Thus, [**we must make
choices** about where our action can be most useful or which injustices
we regard as most urgent.]{.underline} While a social connection model
of responsibility will not give us a list of maxims or imperatives, it
should offer some parameters for reasoning to guide our decisions and
actions. These parameters, in turn, address the other question I raised
earlier---the question about kinds and degrees of responsibility.
Different agents plausibly have different kinds of responsibilities in
relation to particular issues of justice, and some arguably have a
greater degree of responsibility than others.

### Footnoting DA

#### Allowing a permutation allows us to draw a distinction between good and bad war which enacts more militarism in an effort to stop "bad wars" in the west

\[Micheal **Neu** 20**13**\] (The Tragedy of Justified War,
International Relations 27(4), prof @ U of Brighton) xx-xx-2013 //pyrex

I cannot provide an extensive account of binary thinking and lacking
ambiguity in contemporary just war theory here. A few examples, picked
from a pool of many more contemporary theorists whose works one could
draw on, may suffice to make the relevant point. It should become
apparent that [most of the thinkers I refer to do recognize the
ambiguity of moral justifications for war.]{.underline}28 [However, they
do not place this]{.underline} recognition [at the centre of their moral
arguments about war.]{.underline} That is, [they]{.underline} somehow
[fail to engage with the tragedy of justified war]{.underline} in the
broad sense. [There is some fragmented talk of]{.underline} tragedies,
[moral dilemmas]{.underline}, dirty hands and rights infringements, [but
no critical engagement with the kind of thinking in just war theory that
is]{.underline} predominantly -- or in some cases even [exclusively --
concerned with]{.underline} drawing [**binary distinctions** between
just and unjust wars]{.underline} and military operations. [The core
question]{.underline} raised in the literature [is whether or
not]{.underline} one may wage war, and whether or not [certain military
operations may be undertaken; **once the answer has been found, the
moral case is closed**]{.underline} -- particularly, but not exclusively
-- in just war accounts that embrace the kind of style described by
Brown.29 This style, of course, is not Michael Walzer's. When
contemporary analytical philosophers deride his contributions to just
war theory as some kind of 'story-telling',30 devoid of conceptual
clarity, argumentative rigour and methodological finesse, it is perhaps
sentences like the following one that critics have in mind: '\[T\]he
theory of war, when it is fully under- stood, poses a dilemma, which
every theorist \... must resolve as best as he can'.31 Walzer's thinking
nonetheless falls prey to the kind of binary thinking that analytical
theorists would take to new heights a couple of decades later on. While
Walzer famously defends the conceptual plausibility of the notion of
dirty hands, according to which especially politicians must sometimes do
wrong to do right, he introduces this concept into his theory of 'just
and unjust wars' only in his account of 'supreme emergencies'. Here,
political communities cannot help but engage in the intentional killing
of innocent people: \[D\]irty hands aren't permissible (or necessary)
when anything less than the ongoingness of the community is at stake, or
when the danger we face is anything less than communal death. In most
wars, the issue never arises; there are no supreme emergencies; the
normal defense of rights holds unquestioned sway.32

[Criticizing the Hubcaps while the Juggernaut Rolls On]{.underline} The
U.S. military-industrial complex today is so immense as to defy
comprehension. [Even those few paying attention tend to focus on one
small piece at a time]{.underline}. [One month it may be proposals for
nuclear weapons with certain new capabilities. Then the attention may
shift to missile defense]{.underline}-- but there too, only a small part
of the program attracts public debate, with immense programs like the
airborne laser proceeding almost invisibly. Proposals for the intensive
militarization of space like the Space Plane come to light for a day or
two, attracting a brief flurry of interest; the continuing, broad
development of military space technologies, from GPS-aided guidance to
radiation hardened microchips to space power generation, draw even less
scrutiny. There is so broad a consensus among political elites
supporting the constant refinement of conventional armaments that new
generations of strike aircraft, Navy ships, and armored vehicles attract
little notice outside industry and professional circles, with only
spectacular cost overruns or technical failures likely to draw the
occasional headline. [A few Congress people will challenge one or
another particularly extreme new weapon]{.underline} (e.g. the "Robust
Nuclear Earth Penetrator"), [but usually on narrow pragmatic
grounds]{.underline}: we can accomplish the same "mission" with less
risky or cheaper weapons. But the question of "why," seldom is asked,
only "how," or "how much does it cost?" Most of the programs that
constitute the military machine glide silently onward undisturbed, like
the body of a missile submarine invisible below the deceptively small
surfaces that rise above the sea. The United States emerged after both
World War II and the Cold War as the most powerful state on earth\-- the
one with the most choices. The first time, all of this was still new. We
could perhaps understand our ever deeper engagement with the machinery
of death as a series of tragic events, of the inevitable outcome of
fallible humans grappling with the titanic forces they had only recently
unleashed, in the context of a global confrontation layered in secrecy,
ideology, and fear. But this time around, since the end of the Cold War,
we must see the United States as truly choosing, with every new weapon
and every new war, to lead the world into a renewed spiral towards
catastrophe. The past is written, but our understanding of it changes
from moment to moment. [The United States began the nuclear age as the
most powerful nation on earth, and proclaimed the character of the
"American Century" with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a
cryptic message written in the blood of innocents. Its meaning has come
clear over fifty years of technocratic militarism, punctuated by the
deaths of millions in neo-colonial warfare and underscored always by the
willingness to end the world rather than share power with
anyone.]{.underline} [The path ahead still can be changed, but we must
begin with an understanding of where we are, and how we got
here.]{.underline} [In the United States, there is a very long way to go
before we have a debate about the uses of military force that addresses
honestly the weapons we have and seek to develop, much less about the
complex social forces which impel the United States to maintain its
extraordinary levels of forces and armaments.]{.underline} Most
Americans don't know what their government is doing in their name, or
why. Their government, regardless of the party in power, lies about both
its means and its ends on a routine basis. And there is nothing the
government lies about more than nuclear weapons, proclaiming to the
world for the last decade that the United States was disassembling its
nuclear facilities and leading the way to disarmament, while rebuilding
its nuclear weapons plants and planning for another half century and
more of nuclear dominance.74 [It is clear by now that fighting violence
with yet more violence]{.underline}, claiming to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons by threatening the use of nuclear weapons, [is a dead
end]{.underline}. The very notion of "enforcement," that some countries
have the right to judge and punish others for seeking "weapons of mass
destruction," has become an excuse for war making, a cover and
justification for the power and profit agenda of secretive and
undemocratic elites. [The only solution that will increase the security
of ordinary people anywhere is for all of us, in our respective
societies, to do everything we can to get the most violent elements in
our cultures--]{.underline} whether in or out of uniform-- [under
control]{.underline}. In the United States, this will require far more
than changing a few faces in Washington. [We will need a genuine peace
movement, ready to make connections to movements for ecological balance,
and for social and economic justice, and by doing so to address the
causes of war]{.underline}. Before we can expect others to join us, it
must be clear that we are leaving the path of violence.

**Universal liberal principles shape the best ethical and practical

inevitable consequence of enlightenment thought. They abandon essential
normative and conceptual resources for creating an egalitarian future.**

**[Mills 17]{.underline}** (Charles, a Caribbean philosopher from
Jamaica. He is known for his work in social and political philosophy,
particularly in oppositional political theory as centred on class,
gender, and race. "Occupy Liberalism!", Black Rights/White Wrongs,
Kindle)

The "Occupy!" movement, which has made headlines around the country, has
raised the hopes of young American radicals new to political engagement
and revived the hopes of an older generation of radicals still clinging
to nostalgic dreams of the glorious '603. If the original and still most
salient target was Wall Street, a long list of other candidates for
"occupation" has since been put forward. In this essay, **[I want to
propose as a target for radical occupation the somewhat unusual
candidate of liberalism itself]{.underline}**. But **[contrary to the
conventional wisdom prevailing within radical circles, I am going to
argue for the heretical thesis that liberalism should not be
contemptuously rejected by radicals but retrieved for a radical
agenda]{.underline}**. Summarized in bullet-point form, my argument is
as follows: 0 The "**[Occupy]{.underline}** Wall Street\" movement
**[provides an opportunity unprecedented in decades to build a broad
democratic movement to challenge plutocracy, patriarchy, and white
supremacy in the United States]{.underline}**. 0 **[Such a movement is
more likely to be successful if it appeals to principles and values most
Americans already endorse]{.underline}**. o Liberalism has always been
the dominant ideology in the United States. - **[Liberalism in the
United States has historically been complicit with plutocracy,
patriarchy, and white supremacy, but this complicity is a contingent
function of dominant group interests rather than the result of an
immanent conceptual logic]{.underline}**. **[Therefore
progressives]{.underline}** in philosophy \[and elsewhere) **[should try
to retrieve liberalism for a radical democratic agenda rather than
rejecting it]{.underline}**, thereby positioning themselves in the
ideological mainstream of the country and seeking its transformation.
**[Let me now try to make this argument plausible for an audience likely
to be aprioristically convinced of its obvious
unsoundness]{.underline}**. Preliminary Clarification of Terms First we
need to clarify the key terms of "radicalism" and "liberalism." While of
course a radicalism of the right exists, I mean to refer here to
radicals who are progressives. But "progressive" cannot just denote the
left of the political spectrum, since the whole point of the "new social
movements" of the 19 605 onwards was that the traditional left-right
political spectrum, predicated on varying positions on the question of
public vs. private ownership, did not ex- haust the topography of the
political. Issues of gender and racial domination were to a significant
extent "orthogonal" to this one-dimensional trope. So I will use
"radicalism" broadly, though still in the zone of progressive politics,
to refer generally to ideas/ concepts / principles/values endorsing
pro-egalitari- an structural change to reduce or eliminate unjust
hierarchies of domination. "Liberalism" may denote both a political
philosophy and the institutions and practices characteristically tied to
that political philosophy. My focus will be on the former. The issue of
how bureaucratic logics may prove refractory to reformist agendas is
undeniably an important one, but it does not really fall into the
purview of philosophy proper. My aim is to challenge the radical
Shibboleth that radical ideas / concepts/ principles/values are
incompatible with liberalism. Given the deep entrenchment of this
assumption in the worldview of most radicals, refuting it would still be
an accomplishment, even if working out practical details of
operationalization are delegated to other hands. In the United States,
of course, "liberalism" in public parlance and everyday political
discourse is used in such a way that it really denotes left- liberalism
specifically ("left" by the standards of a country whose center of
gravity has shifted right in recent decades\]. In this vocabulary,
right-liberals are then categorized as "conservatives"---in the market
sense, as against the Burkean sense. On the other hand, some on the
right would insist that only they, the heirs to the classic liberalism
of John Locke and Adam Smith, are re- ally entitled to the "liberal"
designation. Later welfarist theorists are fraudu- lent pretenders to be
exposed as socialist intruders unworthy of the title. Re- jecting both
of these usages, I will be employing "liberalism" in the expanded sense
typical of political philosophy, which links both ends of this spectrum.
"Liberalism" then refers broadly to the anti-feudal ideology of
individual- ism, equal rights, and moral egalitarianism that arises in
Western Europe in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries to challenge
the ideas and values inherited from the old medieval order, and which is
subsequently taken up and develped by others elsewhere, including many
who would have been explicitly excluded by the original conception of
the ideology. Left-wing so- cial democrats and right---wing market
conservatives, fans of John Rawls on the one hand and Robert Nozick on
the other, are thus both liberals.1 From this perspective, it will be
appreciated that liberalism is not a monolith but an umbrella term for a
variety of positions. Here are some ex- amples---some familiar, some
perhaps less so: **[Varieties of Liberalism Left-wing]{.underline}**
\[social democratic) vs. **[Right-wing]{.underline}** (market
conservative) Kantian vs. Lockean Contractarian vs. Utilitarian
Corporate vs. Democratic Social vs. Individualist Comprehensive vs.
Political Ideal-theory vs. Non-ideal-theory Patriarchal vs. Feminist
**[Imperial vs. Anti-imperial Racial vs. Anti-racial Color-blind vs.
Color-conscious Etc]{.underline}**. It is not the case, of course, that
these different species of liberalism have been equally represented in
the ideational sphere, or equally implemented in the institutional
sphere. On the contrary, some have been dominant while others have been
subordinate, and some have never, at least in the full sense, been
implemented at all. But nonetheless, I suggest **[they all count as
liberalisms and as such they are all supposed to have certain elements
in common, even those characterized by gender and racial
exclusions]{.underline}**. (My motivation for making these last
varieties of liberalism rather than deviations from liberalism is
precisely to challenge liberalism's self- congratulatory history, which
holds an idealized Platonized liberalism aloft, untainted by its actual
record of complicity with oppressive social systems.) So **[the initial
question we should always ask people making generalizations about
"liberalism" is: What particular variety of liberalism do you
mean?]{.underline}** And **[are your generalizations really true about
all the possible kinds of liberalism, or only a subset?]{.underline}**
Here is a characterization of liberalism from a very respectable source,
the British political theorist, John Gray: **[Common to all variants of
the liberal tradition is a definite conception]{.underline}**,
distinctively modern in character, **[of man and society]{.underline}**.
. . . **[It is individualist, in that it asserts the moral primacy of
the person against the claims of any social collectivity;
egalitarian]{.underline}**, inasmuch as it confers on all men the same
moral status and denies the relevance to legal or political order of
differences in moral worth among human beings; **[universalist,
affirming the moral unity of the human species and according a secondary
importance to specific historic associations and cultural forms; and
meliorist in its affirmation of the corrigibility and improvability of
all social institutions and political arrangements]{.underline}**. It is
this conception of man and society which gives liberalism a definite
identity which transcends its vast internal variety and complexity.2
What generate the different varieties of liberalism are different
concepts of individualism, different claims about how egalitarianism
should be con- strued or realized, more or less inclusionary readings of
universalism \[Gray's characterization sanitizes liberalism's actual
sexist and racist history), dif- ferent views of what count as desirable
improvements, conﬂicting normative balancings of liberal values
(freedom, equality) and competing theoretical prognoses about how best
they can be realized in the light of (contested) soda-historical facts.
The huge potential for disagreement about all of these explains how a
common liberal core can produce such a wide range of vari- ants.
Moreover, **[we need to take into account not merely the spectrum of
actual liberalisms but also hypothetical liberalisms that could be
generated through novel framings of some or all of the
above]{.underline}**. So one would need to differentiate dominant
versions of liberalism from Oppositional versions, and actual from
possible variants. Once the breadth of the range of liberalisms is
appreciated---dominant and subordinate, actual and potential---the
obvious question then raised is: **[Even if actual dominant liberalisms
have been conservative in various ways (corporate, patriarchal, racist)
why does this rule out the development of emancipatory, radical
liberalisms?]{.underline}** **[One kind of answer is the
following]{.underline}** \[call this the internalist answer): **[Because
there is an immanent conceptual/ normative logic to liberalism as a
political ideology that precludes any emancipatory development of
it]{.underline}**. **[Another kind of answer is the
following]{.underline}** \[call this the externalist an- swer): **[It
doesn\'t. The historic domination of conservative exclusionary lib-
eralisms is the result of group interests, group power, and successful
group political projects. Apparent internal conceptual /normative
barriers to an emancipatory liberalism can be successfully negotiated by
drawing on the conceptual/normative resources of liberalism
itself]{.underline}**, in conjunction with a revisionist
socio-historical picture of modernity. **[Most self-described radicals
would endorse]{.underline}**---indeed, reﬂexively, as an obvious
truth-**[the first answer]{.underline}**. But as indicated from the
beginning, I think **[the second answer is actually the correct
one]{.underline}**. **[The obstacles to developing a "radical
liberalism" are, in my opinion, primarily externalist in nature:
material group interests, and the way they have shaped hegemonic
varieties of liberalism.]{.underline}** So I think **[we need to try to
justify a radical agenda with the normative resources of liberalism
rather than writing off liberalism]{.underline}**. Since liberalism has
always been the dominant ideology in the United States, and is now
globally hegemonic, **[such a project would have the great ideological
advantage of appealing to values and principles that most people already
endorse. All projects of egalitarian social transformation are going to
face a combination of material, political, and ideological obstacles,
but this strategy would at least reduce somewhat the dimensions of the
last]{.underline}**. One would be trying to win mass support for
policies that---and the challenge will, of course, be to demonstrate
this---are justifiable by majoritarian norms, once reconceived and put
in conjunction with facts not always familiar to the majority.
**[Material barriers \[vested group interests) and political barriers
\[organizational difficulties) will of course remain. But they will
constitute a general obstacle for all egalitarian political programs,
and as such cannot be claimed to be peculiar problems for an
emancipatory liberalism]{.underline}**. But **[the contention will be
that such a liberalism cannot be developed]{.underline}**. Why? Here are
ten familiar objections, variants of internalism, and my re- plies to
them. **[Ten Reasons Why Liberalism Cannot Be Radicalized (And My
Replies)]{.underline}** 1. Liberalism Has an Asocial, Atomic
Individualist Ontology This is one of the oldest radical critiques of
liberalism; it can be found in Marx's derisive comments, for example in
the Grundrisse, about the "Robin- sonades" of the social contract theory
whose "golden age" \[1650---1800) had long passed by the time he began
his intellectual and political career: The individual and isolated
hunter or fisher who forms the starting-point with Smith and Ricardo
belongs to the insipid illusions of the eighteenth century. They are
Robinson Crusoe stories . . . . no more based on such a naturalism than
is Rousseau's contrat social which makes naturally inde--- pendent
individuals come in contact and have mutual intercourse by con-
tract\... . . Man is in the most literal sense of the word a zoon
politikon, not only a social animal, but an animal which can develop
into an individual only in society. Production by individuals outside
society . . . is as great an absurdity as the idea of the development of
language without individuals living together and talking to one
another.3 But several replies can be made to this indictment. To begin
with, even if the accusation is true of contractarian liberalism, not
all liberalisms are contractarian. Utilitarian liberalism rests on
different theoretical founda- tions, as does the late
nineteenth---century British liberalism of T. H. Green and his
colleagues: a l-legelian, social liberalism.4 Closer to home, of course,
we have \[ohn Dewey's brand of liberalism. MoreOver, even within the so-
cial contract tradition, resources exist for contesting the assumptions
of the Hobbesian/Lockean version of the contract. Rousseau\'s Discourse
on the Origins of Inequality \[1755) (nowhere given proper credit by
Marxs) re- thinks the "contract" to make it a contract entered into
after the formation of society, and thus the creation of socialized
human beings. So the ontology presupposed is explicitly a social one. In
any case, the contemporary revival of contractarianism initiated by John
Rawls\'s 1971 A Theory of \] ustice makes the contract a thought
experiment, a "device of representation,\" rather than a literal or even
metaphorical anthropological account. The communitar- ian/contractarian
debates of the 19805 onwards recapitulated much of the "asocial"
critique of contractarian liberalism (though usually without a radi- cal
edge). But as Rawls pointed out against Michael Sandel, for example, one
needs to distinguish the figures in the thought experiment from real hu-
man beings.6 And radicals should be wary about accepting a communitarian
ontology and claims about the general good that deny or marginalize the
dynamics of group domination in actual societies represented as
"communi- ties." The great virtue of contractarian liberal individualism
is the conceptu- al room it provides for hegemonic norms to be
critically evaluatedthrough the epistemic and moral distancing from
Sittiichkeit that the contract, as an intellectual device, provides. 2.
**[Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology]{.underline}**---I (Macro) The second point needs to be
logically distinguished from the first, since a theory could acknowledge
the social shaping of individuals while denying that group oppression is
central to that shaping. \[So #1 is necessary, but not sufficient, for
#2.) **[The Marxist critique]{.underline}**, of course,
**[was]{.underline}** supposed to encapsulate both points: **[people
were shaped by society and society]{.underline}** (post- "primitive
communism\") **[was class-dominated. The ontology was social and it was
an ontology of class]{.underline}**. **[Today radicals would demand a
richer ontology that can accommodate]{.underline}** the realities of
gender and **[racial oppression]{.underline}** also. But whatever
candidates are put forward, **[the 'key claim is that a liberal frame-
work cannot accommodate an ontology of groups in relations of domination
and subordination]{.underline}**. To the extent that liberalism
recognizes social groups, these are basically conceived of as voluntary
associations that one chooses to join or not join, which is obviously
very different from, say, class, race, and gender memberships. But
**[this evasive ontology]{.underline}**, which obfuscates the most
central and obvious fact about all societies since humanity exited the
hunting-and-gathering stage---viz, that they are characterized by
oppressions of one kind or another---**[is not a definitional
constituent of liberalism]{.underline}**. **[Liberalism has certainly
recognized some kinds of oppression]{.underline}**: the absolutism it
opposed in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, the Nazism and
Stalinism it opposed in the twentieth century. **[Liberalism's failure
to systematically address structural oppression in supposedly
liberal-democratic societies is a contingent artifact of the group
perspectives and group interests privileged by those structures, not an
intrinsic feature of liberalism's conceptual apparatus]{.underline}**.

#### Critics of liberalism rely on generalized linkages of classical and left-liberalism, which ignores the self-correcting nature of the liberal state

\[**The Economist 18\]**(Liberalism is the most successful idea of the

In fact, [liberalism contains a wide range of intellectual traditions
which provide different answers to the question of how to trade off the
relative claims of rights and responsibilities]{.underline}, individual
expression and social ties. Even [classical liberals]{.underline} who
were most insistent on removing constraints on individual freedom
[agonised about atomisation]{.underline}. The mid-[Victorians were great
institution-builders]{.underline}, creating everything from voluntary
organisations to joint-stock companies ("little republics" in the phrase
of Robert Lowe, a 19th-century British statesman) that were [designed to
fill the space between the state and society]{.underline}. Later
[liberals experimented with a range of ideas from devolving power from
the centre to creating national education systems]{.underline}. Mr
Deneen's [fixation on the essence of liberalism leads to the second big
problem of his book:]{.underline} his [failure to recognise liberalism's
ability to reform itself]{.underline} and address its internal problems.
The [late 19th century saw America suffering from many of the problems
that are reappearing today,]{.underline} including the [creation of a
business aristocracy, the rise of vast companies, the corruption of
politics and the sense that society was dividing into winners and
losers.]{.underline} But a wide [variety of reformers, working within
the liberal tradition, tackled these problems head on.]{.underline}
Theodore [Roosevelt took on the trusts.]{.underline} [Progressives
cleaned up government corruption. University reformers modernised
academic syllabuses and built ladders of opportunity]{.underline}.
Rather than dying, [liberalism reformed itself]{.underline}. Mr Deneen
is right to point out that [the record of liberalism in recent years has
been dismal.]{.underline} He is also right to assert that the [world has
much to learn from the premodern notions of liberty as self-mastery and
self-denial.]{.underline} The [biggest enemy of liberalism is not so
much atomisation but old-fashioned greed,]{.underline} as members of the
Davos elite pile their plates ever higher with perks and share options.
But he is w[rong to argue that the only way for people to liberate
themselves from the contradictions of liberalism is "liberation from
liberalism itself"]{.underline}. The best way to read "Why Liberalism
Failed" is not as a funeral oration but as a call to action: up your
game, or else.

### Heuristics Good

**Theory should produce [heuristics]{.underline} that engage [specific
political contexts]{.underline} -- the neg's universal theory of
liberalism [inevitably fails]{.underline} to deal with the
[contingency]{.underline} of political life**

**[Zanotti 15 -- Associate Professor of Political Science at Virginia
Tech]{.underline}** (Laura, "Questioning universalism, devising an
ethics without foundations: An exploration of international relations
ontologies and epistemologies," Journal of International Political
Theory 11(3):277-295, accessed 5-26-16)

Friedrich Kratochwil's (2009) contribution to Bauer and Brighi's volume
addresses most of the issues listed above. Distinctive of a pragmatic
approach is its antifoundationalist position, one that "does not begin
with objects or 'things' (ontology), or with reason and method
(epistemology), but with 'acting' (prattein), thereby preventing some
false starts" (Kratochwil, 2009: 20). Pace Waltz, for Kratochwil (2009)
**[one of the main problematic aspects of IR theory is its preference
for broad abstractions and overarching theorizations]{.underline}**.
**[Instead of assessing a theory's validity based upon its
generality]{.underline}** and capacity to encompass a wide range of
phenomena, **[we should do]{.underline}** exactly **[the
opposite]{.underline}**: "Instead of relying on certainty and universal
validity gained through abstraction and controlled experiments, we know
that completeness and attentiveness to detail, rather than to
generality, matter" (Kratochwil, 2009: 20). Indeed, **[ethical and
political choices are always made in conditions of]{.underline}**
partial **[uncertainty]{.underline}**. It is exactly because it takes
seriously the "always preliminary character of knowledge" that **[a
pragmatic approach is likely to provide us with instruments to follow a
course of action that is a "good bet" in contingent
circumstances]{.underline}**. In this framework, **[theories'
veridiction does not rest upon how much of the world out there can be
made to fit into a model]{.underline}**, or upon how many outcomes a
theory may be able to predict. **[The cure for the Cartesian
doubt]{.underline}** (i.e. doubting the totality of our knowledge
claims) **[cannot be found by aspiring to "absolute certainty," but
by]{.underline}** accepting and **[embracing uncertainty]{.underline}**.
Indeed, Jacques Derrida (1992) argued ethics and political engagements
are rooted upon the undecidability of meaning. For Derrida, in making
ethical decisions, we exceed what can be calculated or delimited by law,
while remaining aware that our critique is never waged from an external
standpoint of absolute knowledge, but is inevitably imbricated in the
very foundations we criticize. For Kratochwil, **[a theory's aim is not
to provide universal solutions]{.underline}** to all human problems,
**[but to help us in making choices in contingent conditions of
uncertainty]{.underline}** (i.e. "get by" in the world), and to generate
questions that were not previously on the table (i.e. creatively imagine
alternative possibilities to "what is"). **[International politics
requires focusing on]{.underline}** diagnostic "appraisal" and
**["judgment" instead of abstractions]{.underline}**. Uncertainty is
imbricated with our way of being in the world. Pace versions of
constructivism that reify and substantialize "rules" as "(enabling)
causes" of behavior (Finnemore, 1996), for Kratochwil, rules are not
"transparent" and self-contained, and cannot be imagined as efficient
causes. Instead, the understanding of rules is complex and always
defined by "what is the case in the context of a social understanding"
(Kratochwil, 2008: 93). Kratochwil's emphasis on uncertainty is rooted
upon his critique of extant conceptualizations of causality. **[Events
should be understood as the result of a cluster of conditions coming
together under specific circumstances rather than deriving from linear
cause--effect relations]{.underline}**. These clusters of conditions may
be described ex-post facto but cannot necessarily be modeled in the
abstract. See, for instance, this account of what triggered a fire in a
building: For example, the source of the fire was an electric coffee
machine that was not switched off. However, it would have not caused a
fire, had the window not been open and had the curtain, moved by the
wind, not touched the hot plate (since I had not placed the coffee pot
there but had left it in the sink). But even the curtain would not have
been able to cause further damage had the initial flames not reached a
pile of old papers atop the cupboard, and had the sprinkler system
actually worked instead of being deactivated by a faulty sensor. In
other words, instead of arguing with necessary and sufficient
conditions, we are only able to make much more contingent claims.
(Kratochwil, 2008: 95--96) **[Kratochwil's understanding of causality
demands a conceptualization of knowledge as an endeavor that embraces
contingency, offers roadmaps to navigate them, and devises new
possibilities for making sense of the world we live in]{.underline}**.
**[It]{.underline}** also **[fosters an ethics that is not justified
based on what is "universally right" but]{.underline}** is instead
**[practiced by embracing uncertainty and by assuming responsibility for
choices that take into account what is at stake]{.underline}** in a
given situation. Universal normativity is flawed not only because norms
are "thick" and subject to contextual interpretation. Uncertainty
pertains not only to the interpretation of norms but also to their
"applicability" in specific situations. Most of the time, we operate in
the context of incompleteness of information regarding what conditions
obtain in the circumstances of our actions. In this framework, our
position as agents is not patterned on the model of "sovereignty," or on
the image of the "monad" endowed with "potentia," able to ordain effects
by triggering linear chains of causality. **[Agency]{.underline}** is
indeed uncertain and path-dependent. It **[is rooted on the ability to
appraise and diagnose "what is the case" and to make "good guesses" with
incomplete information in complex situations]{.underline}**.
**[Validating ethical choices based upon universal normativity
obfuscates the complex clusters of causes that shape the specific
situations we are in and may lead to ethically very questionable
choices]{.underline}**. In the conclusions of his "Tartu lecture,"
Kratochwil (2007) summarizes a few points that are quite relevant for my
argument. A pragmatic starting point fosters a revision of ideas of
knowledge as a representation of what is "out there." For Kratochwil, as
stated before, theories are valuable when they enable us to ask
questions that were not previously asked, and to help us "to get by" in
the world. While asking new questions has to do with creativity, which
Connolly (2013) considers a political virtue of central importance for
transforming "what is," the ability to "get by" in the world points to
the need for careful assessment of what obtains in the situation we
engage in. It is indeed a "practical skill" more similar to "know how"
than to rule following. For Kratochwil, we should abandon notions of
truth as anchored "either in things themselves (as in classical
ontology) or in reason itself (as in the foundationalist interpretation
of the Kantian project)" (Kratochwil, 2007: 13). However, **[embracing
uncertainty]{.underline}** for Kratochwil **[does not equal to embracing
"anything goes" positions]{.underline}**, that is, absolute skepticism.
**[This kind of skepticism is indeed the result of "fruitless meta
theoretical traps" and of conceptualizations of knowledge as deriving
from "private ruminations of actors."]{.underline}** Instead,
**[Kratochwil sees the task of theorizing as a diagnostic of "what is
the case" in practice]{.underline}**. **[The validation of a theory
depends upon its capacity of providing instruments to make "good bets"
while creatively transforming "what is."]{.underline}** In the sections
that follow, I will develop a reflection on the connections between an
epistemology that starts from practices and the possibility of
reconceptualizing ethics and political agency in a way that does not
rely upon universal normativity. The metaphor of the "tool" is key for
this reflection.

### No Securitization

#### One speech act does nothing and there are checks on the worst forms of militaristic discourse. 

\[Regina **Heller et al 2012**\] (The \'dark\' side of normative
argumentation: The case of counterterrorism policy," Global
Constitutionalism Vol. 1 Issue 2 p. 278-312 Institute for Peace Research
and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg) xx-xx-2012 //pyrex
ultra

While we regard [securitization theory]{.underline} as a very useful
means to understand how actors in general try to legitimize certain
practices by challenging existing norms, we contend that the theory [can
only unfold]{.underline} its full [explanatory capacity when it is
amended]{.underline} by a number of aspects to which critics of the CS
have pointed [and]{.underline} when [supplemented by]{.underline} the
[framing theory]{.underline} approach. [An important aspect]{.underline}
here [is the]{.underline} CS' [problematic characterization of
securitization as 'self-referential']{.underline}. According to Buzan et
al. ( 1998 : 24), an 'issue becomes a security issue -- not necessarily
because a real existential threat exists but because the issue is
presented as such a threat' (see also: Balzacq 2005 : 181). [This is
problematic because the audience must accept this presentation
**before** the issue can be regarded as securitized]{.underline} (Buzan
et al. 1998 : 25). Buzan ( 1997 : 27) has moreover written that
securitization 'is constituted by the intersubjective establishment of
an existential threat with a saliency sufﬁ cient to have substantial
political effects'. [This]{.underline}, however, is not a
self-referential process and it [implies that **with the simple uttering
of 'security'**, the process of **securitization does not** come to an
**end.** Securitization 'moves' must be understood as only **one part**
of the securitization process]{.underline}, as an attempt to securitize
a certain issue. The CS acknowledges that [for securitization to 'work',
several conditions need to be fulﬁlled]{.underline}: '(1) the demand
internal to [the speech act]{.underline} of following the grammar of
security, (2) the [social conditions]{.underline} regarding the position
of authority for the securitizing actor -- that is, the relationship
between speaker and audience and thereby the likelihood of the audience
accepting the claims made in a securitizing attempt, [and]{.underline}
(3) [features of the alleged threats that either facilitate or impede
securitization']{.underline} (Buzan et al. 1998 : 33; Wæver 2000 :
252--5; see also: Buzan and Wæver 2003 : 71--4). 15 Nevertheless,
critics have contended that the CS has not worked on the facilitating
conditions as differentiatedly and intensively as might be necessary
(see e.g. Stritzel 2007 ). Generally, they point out the need to better
'embed' securitization in a more process-like and a more 'interactive',
audience-related set of conditions (see: Balzacq 2005 ; 2011 : 27;
McDonald 2008 ; Williams 2011 ). In order to understand how
securitization works and how it contributes to the transcending of a
given normative setting, [one has to contextualize the use of
language]{.underline}, i.e. a) take into account the cultural context
into which this use of language is embedded, [and]{.underline} b) [look
at the very particular way a securitizing actor makes use of
language]{.underline}. With respect to the ﬁ rst point, Balzacq ( 2005 :
172) puts forward the argument that [**'**securitization is better
understood as a strategic (pragmatic) practice that occurs
within]{.underline}, and as part of, [a conﬁguration of
circumstances]{.underline}, [including the context, the]{.underline}
psycho-cultural disposition of the [audience, and the power]{.underline}
that both [speaker and listener bring to the interaction']{.underline}
(see also: Leonard and Kaunert 2011 ). McDonald ( 2008 : 573) also
underlines this when he argues that one has to keep in mind that 'those
interested in the construction of security must pay attention to the
social, political and historical contexts in which particular discourses
of security (even those deﬁ ned narrowly in terms of the designation and
articulation of threat) become possible'. [One could
object]{.underline}, however, [that governmental actors]{.underline},
especially when they are part of the security establishment,
[unremittingly make securitizing moves because it is]{.underline} part
of [their business to do so]{.underline}. Most probably, they often do
not really care whether each single act is actually successful. [Be that
as it may]{.underline}, [the debate about the contexts and 'facilitating
conditions' of securitization is important]{.underline} even in such a
case, [because securitizing actors must always take into
account]{.underline} the cultural [contexts]{.underline} and conditions
in order [to maintain the chance of their 'securitizing moves' becoming
successful]{.underline} (see: McDonald 2008 ; Balzacq 2005 , 2011 ;
Stritzel 2007 ). Moreover, [a securitizing actor]{.underline} not only
needs to consider the respective discourse or context, but also [has to
frame the arguments in a way that they ﬁnd resonance with the
audience]{.underline}. This is in accordance with Balzacq's ( 2005 :
184) observation that '[the success of securitization is highly
contingent upon the securitizing actor's ability to identify with the
audience's feelings, needs, and interests']{.underline}, and that 'the
speaker has to tune his/her language to the audience's experience' (see
also: McDonald 2008 : 564; Balzacq 2011 : 9). [In order to be
successful, the speaker must use the appropriate language and heuristic
artifacts that 'facilitate the mobilization of the audience]{.underline}
-- analogies, metaphors, metonymies, emotions, stereotypes' (Balzacq
2005 : 173; see also 2011 : 9). [Therefore, the speaker has to
skillfully employ language that resonates with the
audience]{.underline}. This is even more important where the ideas,
practices or measures to be legitimized extend to issues considered
taboo. Norm challengers even have to anticipate that attempts to bring
an established norm into question may, in the end, lead to its reafﬁ
rmation. In other words, [it is not only what is said that is important
but also the manner in which the securitizing actor makes the case for
an issue]{.underline}, his 'capacity to use appropriate words and cogent
frames of reference in a given context' (Balzacq 2005 : 190, 192; see
also 2011 : 14). [This]{.underline} again [points to the importance
of]{.underline} the use of [frames]{.underline} in order [to
structure]{.underline} various [properties of]{.underline} [an issue
under the label]{.underline} '[security threat']{.underline}. As Vultee
( 2011 : 79) has put it: '\[S\]ecuritization is a form of framing that
highlights the existential threat of an issue.' Buzan et al. ( 1998 :
23) obviously had this in mind when they wrote that '"\[s\]ecurity" is
the move that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game
and frames the issue either as a special kind of politics or as above
politics.' However, the CS has not elaborated much on the framing issue.
[Securitization theory is]{.underline} also [underspeciﬁed]{.underline}
in this regard. Most critics, although pointing to the necessity of
analyzing pragmatic aspects such as the 'wording', the concrete use of
language in securitization, have not had recourse to framing theory, at
least not explicitly. This comes as a surprise, as some researchers have
argued for the use of framing theory for setting the threat agenda.
Eriksson and Noreen ( 2002 ) for example contend that categorizing
something as a 'security threat' (or 'securitization') is a form of
'threat framing'. Based on the assumption that political speech is
supposed to 'convince', applying framing theory appears useful; in
addition, we can make the empirical observation that such framing
methods, which are supposed to convince and persuade, are indeed being
used in practice (see below).

### Pragmatism Key

#### Militarism results from a confluence of causal factors \-\-- searching for pragmatic solutions to particular instances is the most effective way to challenge it

\[Andrew **Bacevich 2013**\] (The New American Militarism, p. 205-210,
Professor of History and International Relations at Boston University
and Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History from Princeton University)
xx-xx-2013 //pyrex ultra

There is, wrote H. L. Mencken, "always a well-known solution to every
human problem---neat, plausible, and wrong."1 Mencken's aphorism applies
in spades to the subject of this account. [To imagine that there exists
a **simple antidote** to the "military metaphysic"]{.underline} [to
which the people and government of the United States have fallen prey is
to **misconstrue the problem.**]{.underline} As the foregoing chapters
make plain, [the origins of America's present-day infatuation with
military power are **anything but simple.**]{.underline} [American
militarism is **not the invention of a cabal nursing fantasies of global
empire** and manipulating an unsuspecting people frightened by the
events of 9/11.]{.underline} Further, [it is **counterproductive** to
think in these terms]{.underline}--- to assign culpability to a
particular president or administration and to imagine that throwing the
bums out will put things right. Yet [neither does the present-day status
of the United States as sole superpower reveal an **essential truth**,
whether positive or negative, about the American project.
Enthusiasts]{.underline} (mostly [on the right)]{.underline} who
interpret America's possession of unrivaled and unprecedented armed
might as proof that the United States enjoys the mandate of heaven [are
deluded. **But so too are those (mostly on the left)**]{.underline} [who
see in the far-flung doings of today's U.S. military establishment
substantiation]{.underline} of Major General Smedley Butler's old
chestnut [that]{.underline} "war is just a racket" and the [American
soldier "a gangster for capitalism]{.underline}" sent abroad [to do the
bidding of Big Business or Big Oil.]{.underline}2 [**Neither the will of
God nor the venality of Wall Street** suffices to explain]{.underline}
how the United States managed to become stuck in World [War]{.underline}
IV. [Rather]{.underline}, the new American [militarism is a little like
**pollution**---the perhaps unintended, but **foreseeable** by-product
of prior choices and **decisions made without taking fully into account
the full range of costs likely to be incurred.**]{.underline} In making
the industrial revolution, the captains of American enterprise did not
consciously set out to foul the environment, but as they harnessed the
waters, crisscrossed the nation with rails, and built their mills and
refineries, negative consequences ensued. Lakes and rivers became choked
with refuse, the soil contaminated, and the air in American cities
filthy. By the time that the industrial age approached its zenith in the
middle of the twentieth century, most Americans had come to take this
for granted; a degraded environment seemed the price you had to pay in
exchange for material abundance and by extension for freedom and
opportunity. Americans might not like pollution, but there seemed to be
no choice except to put up with it. To appreciate that this was, in
fact, not the case, Americans needed a different consciousness. This is
where the environmental movement, beginning more or less in the 1960s,
made its essential contribution. Environmentalists enabled Americans to
see the natural world and their relationship to that world in a
different light. They argued that the obvious deterioration in the
environment was unacceptable and not at all inevitable. Alternatives did
exist[. Different **policies** and **practices** could **stanch and even
reverse the damage.** Purists]{.underline} in that movement insisted
upon the primacy of environmental needs, everywhere and in all cases.
Theirs was (and is) a principled [position]{.underline} [deserving to be
heard. To act on their recommendations, however, would]{.underline}
likely [mean]{.underline} shutting down the economy, [an **impractical**
and **politically infeasible** course of **action**. Pragmatists
advanced a different argument.]{.underline} [They suggested that it was
possible to negotiate a compromise between economic needs and
environmental imperatives.]{.underline} This compromise might oblige
Americans to curtail certain bad habits, but it did not require changing
the fundamentals of how they lived their lives. Americans could keep
their cars and continue their love affair with consumption; but at the
same time they could also have cleaner air and cleaner water.
Implementing this compromise has produced an outcome that environmental
radicals (and on the other side, believers in laissez-faire capitalism)
today find unsatisfactory. In practice, it turns out, once begun
negotiations never end. Bargaining is continuous, contentious, and
deeply politicized. Participants in the process seldom come away with
everything they want. [Settling for half a loaf when you covet the whole
is inevitably frustrating. But the **results are
self-evident.**]{.underline} [Environmental conditions]{.underline} in
the United States today [are **palpably better** than they were a half
century ago. Pollution]{.underline} has not been vanquished, but it [has
become more manageable.]{.underline} Furthermore, the nation has
achieved those improvements without imposing on citizens undue burdens
and without preventing its entrepreneurs from innovating, creating, and
turning a profit. [Restoring]{.underline} a semblance of
[balance]{.underline} and good sense [to]{.underline} [the way that
Americans think about]{.underline} [military power will **require a
similarly pragmatic approach.** Undoing **all**]{.underline} of the
[negative effects]{.underline} that result [from]{.underline} having
been seduced by [war]{.underline} [may lie beyond reach, but Americans
can]{.underline} at least [**make them more manageable**
and]{.underline} thereby [salvage their democracy]{.underline}. In
explaining the origins of the new American militarism, this account has
not sought to assign or to impute blame. None of the protagonists in
this story sat down after Vietnam and consciously plotted to propagate
perverse attitudes toward military power any more than Andrew Carnegie
or John D. Rockefeller plotted to despoil the nineteenth-century
American landscape. The clamor after Vietnam to rebuild the American
arsenal and to restore American self-confidence, the celebration of
soldierly values, the search for ways to make force more usable: all of
these came about because groups of Americans thought that they glimpsed
in the realm of military affairs the solution to vexing problems. The
soldiers who sought to rehabilitate their profession, the intellectuals
who feared that America might share the fate of Weimar, the strategists
wrestling with the implications of nuclear weapons, the conservative
Christians appalled by the apparent collapse of traditional morality:
none of these acted out of motives that were inherently dishonorable. To
the extent that we may find fault with the results of their efforts,
that fault is more appropriately attributable to human fallibility than
to malicious intent. And yet **[in the end it is not motive that matters
but outcome]{.underline}**. Several decades after Vietnam, in the
aftermath of a century filled to overflowing with evidence pointing to
the limited utility of armed force and the dangers inherent in relying
excessively on military power, [the American people have persuaded
themselves that their best prospect for safety and salvation lies with
the sword.]{.underline} Told that despite all of their past martial
exertions, treasure expended, and lives sacrificed, the world they
inhabit is today more dangerous than ever and that they must redouble
those exertions, they dutifully assent. Much as dumping raw sewage into
American lakes and streams was once deemed unremarkable, so [today
"global power projection"]{.underline}---a phrase whose sharp edges we
have worn down through casual use, but which implies military activism
without apparent limit---[has become standard practice]{.underline}, a
normal condition, [one to which no plausible alternatives seem to
exist.]{.underline} All of this Americans have come to take for granted:
it's who we are and what we do. [Such a definition of normalcy cries out
for a close and critical reexamination.]{.underline} Surely, the
surprises, disappointments, painful losses, and woeful, even shameful
failures of the Iraq War make clear the need to rethink the fundamentals
of U.S. military policy. Yet a meaningful reexamination will require
first a change of consciousness, seeing war and America's relationship
to war in a fundamentally different way. by loose talk about the resort
to nuclear weapons.

### Role of the Ballot

### Realism Good

#### Realism is the only way to deconstruct violence \-\-\-- the aff is key

\[Duncan **Bell 2017**\] (Security and Poverty: On Realism and Global
Justice, Reader in Political Thought and International Relations at the
University of Cambridge, Available Online from
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/49009820/Bell_-_Security_and_Poverty.pdf>?)
//pyrex ultra

Motivating redistribution could assume various forms, with appeals made
to economic self-interest, prudence, sympathy, overlapping identities,
or the claims of reason and the sense of justice.40 The analytical
realist will respond that none of these will gain traction insofar as
they clash with the kind of political feasibility constraints outlined
in the previous section. Indeed [from a realist perspective, **the most
effective way to motivate political interest** in the alleviation of
global poverty is to reframe it as a national security
issue.]{.underline} Should, then, cosmopolitans -- or others keen to
address global poverty systematically -- support the \'securitization\'
of poverty? [To securitize an issue is to refigure it as security
concern and in so doing to lift it above the routines of \'normal\'
politics.]{.underline} An issue that has been successfully securitized
demands urgent political attention, the (re)allocation of extraordinary
resources, time, and energy.41 [Security issues have been classified as
such by \'securitizing actors\' -- often but not always agents of the
state -- as presenting a threat to the political community.]{.underline}
From this perspective, \'\[s\]ecurity issues cannot be reduced to the
existence of objective possibilities of harm. Claims about security and
[threats are made politically efficacious through the authoritative
declaration of an "existential threat" to the object concerned, and
through their acceptance as "security issues" in these terms by a
relevant audience\'.]{.underline} The object concerned is usually the
state, and the threat can be to its autonomy, economic capacity,
identity, and so on. [The effects of a successful process of
securitization are powerful. \'By uttering \"security\" a
state-representative moves a particular development into a specific
area, and thereby claims a special right to use whatever means are
necessary to block it\'.]{.underline}42 The process can be seen, for
example, in the way in which migration is increasingly treated as a
security problem.43 Although [many contemporary realists employ a very
narrow conception of security -- one that focuses primarily on the
material capabilities of states -- a wider understanding of the realist
tradition allows us to see the issue in a different light.]{.underline}
The key here is the essentially contested character of two key concepts
fundamental to the structuring of contemporary politics: the \'national
interest\' and \'security\'.44 Their scope and content are malleable.
Classical realists, such as Arnold Wolfers, recognized that the national
interest was \'an ambiguous symbol\', one that is interpreted in various
ways by diverse groups of actors in different contexts.45 The same is
true of security. Such [a position is entailed by constructivist
ontological commitments. This conceptual elasticity creates a space for
refiguring the status of global poverty.]{.underline} \'\[A\]ny sector,
at any particular time, might be the most important focus for concerns
about threats, vulnerabilities, and defense\'.46 If successful,
\'securitization\' would propel global poverty to the forefront of
government decision-making, harnessing resources currently unavailable.
Indeed a number of issues that were previously regarded as primarily
humanitarian (or moral) in character are already the subject of powerful
securitizing moves. There is an illuminating precedent here: [HIV/AIDS.
During the mid-2000s, there was a concerted attempt by a number of
states (above all the United Kingdom), international institutions,
health care bodies, and relief organizations, to securitize the disease.
It was partially successful, insofar as it rose high on the
international policy agenda (especially at the UN).]{.underline} While
it has now been largely \'de-securitised\', the earlier moment arguably
led to a considerable amount of resources and attention being directed
towards addressing the pandemic.47 Meanwhile, efforts continue to
securitize climate change.48 Some [political theorists might baulk at
this argument, fearing the spectre of instrumentality. It lies outside
the scope of this chapter to engage with the complex ethical issues
surrounding deliberate dissimulation in the name of a greater good.
However, in this case the issue need not arise. The UNDP already
recognises that global poverty is a security issue,]{.underline} insofar
as it threatens the stability of political communities and aggravates
conflict.49 Moreover, this is a theme already highlighted by a number of
political theorists, although they discuss it only in passing.50 The
argument is straightforward, though controversial: poverty leads to
destabilizing social disruption and state failure in strategically
important or volatile parts of the world. Today, it is frequently argued
that the global poor and disposed are ripe targets for recruitment to
antiwestern (and especially Islamist) forces, and poor states are
susceptible to takeover or rebellion. A further argument is that the
mass migration triggered by poverty is itself a political threat to the
west, and in particular Europe -- an argument that was widely invoked in
the migration crisis of 2015. Of course, even if it were successful, the
securitization of global poverty would not be a panacea.51 It would
target some areas more than others, and there would invariably be
numerous problems with implementation. There are two different ways in
which global poverty could be securitized. In the first, one or more
major powers would come to view global poverty as a security threat, and
act accordingly. In the second, assorted international organisations --
and in particular the United Nations Security Council -- would identify
it as such, and act accordingly.52 From an analytical realist
perspective, the former is more plausible. It is probably the only
feasible way in which the most powerful states -- in this world, not a
world run by \'saints\' -- could be motivated within a foreseeable
timeframe to systematically address global poverty. The key question in
the present context is whether the securitization of poverty is
normatively desirable, whether cosmopolitans (or others who believe that
the massive redistribution of global wealth is required) should advocate
it. [Most scholars of the subject regard securitization as almost always
morally and politically problematic. This is because to securitize a
domain is to shield it from the scrutiny of democratic deliberation, the
rule of law, and public accountability.]{.underline} Claudia Aradau, for
example, contends that securitization is dangerous both in terms of the
short-circuiting of democratic procedures and because it is a process
that necessarily leads to the production of \'enemy\' others who need to
be contained or destroyed.53 Discussing the securitization of HIV/AIDS,
Stefan Elbe warns that it \'pushes responses to the disease away from
civil society toward the much less transparent workings of the military
and intelligence organizations, which also possess the power to override
human rights and civil liberties\'.54 Predicated on the construction of
urgent threats and dangerous enemies, it further empowers the least
democratically accountable elements of the state apparatus (and certain
private agents). [Securitization, that is, can undermine the very thing
it claims to protect. Political theorists hardly need reminding of the
threats presented by security-obsessed states. The politics of fear has
been a recurrent theme in modern history.]{.underline}55 The fraught
debate over the necessary trade-offs between liberty and security has
taken on a renewed vigour in recent years, reflecting the assault on
human rights -- at home and abroad -- pursued under the banner of the
\'war on terror\'. Increasingly draconian legislation and security
practices have eroded basic liberties and stoked fear about the future
of democracy. Robert Goodin goes as far as to argue that the behaviour
of political elites in a number of countries, most notably the United
States, can be classified as terrorism.56 The securitization of poverty,
then, is a project beset with ethical and political dangers -- dangers
that threaten, in particular, the already fragile norms and values of
constitutional democracy. [The conventional view of securitization is
premised on a (Schmittian) binary between \'normal politics\' and
\'states of emergency\'.]{.underline}57 More recent work on
securitization has challenged this position, chiefly through taking
greater account of the dynamics of audience reception, non-linguistic
practices, and (perhaps above all) by reconceptualising security as
scalar not binary. This in turn has opened up space for reassessing the
normative dimensions of securitization, and in particular for asking
whether, and under what conditions, securitizing acts might be
legitimate. This line of argument assumes two main forms. First, it
offers an empirical critique of the claim that securitization
necessarily involves the effacement of democratic politics. Secondly, it
challenges the normative claim that securitization is intrinsically an
illegitimate phenomenon. Rita [Floyd has developed the most thorough
normative account of securitization]{.underline}, [arguing that it can
be justified when three conditions (derived from Just War theorizing)
are met:]{.underline} [1. There must be an objective existential threat,
which is to say a threat than endangers the survival of an actor or an
order. 2. The referent object of security must be morally legitimate,
which is the case only when the referent object is conducive to human
well-being defined as the satisfaction of human needs. 3. The security
response must be appropriate to the threat in question, which is to say
that (a) the security response must be measured in accordance with the
capabilities of the aggressor and (b) the securitizing actor must be
sincere in his or her own intentions.]{.underline} 58 Securitization,
she writes, \'has no intrinsic value; what matters are the consequences
of securitisations alone\'.59 What, then, of global poverty?
Securitizing areas previously framed in humanitarian or developmental
terms further extends the rights and responsibilities of the security
apparatuses of the most powerful states, whilst simultaneously
instilling anxiety in their populations by adding to the already long
list of purported security threats. This danger is exacerbated by the
very malleability of the term security. If global poverty is
securitised, along with HIV/AIDS, then where will the line be drawn?
Climate change discourse presents a parallel case. [These are the kinds
of securitization moves which are likely to have significant **effects**
in redirecting **state** **action**.]{.underline} Here we glimpse the
Janus-faced character of securitization. On the one hand, this is a
welcome development -- and it was greeted as such by many environmental
scientists -- for it signals a willingness by well-placed agents to
challenge intransigent attitudes to climate change. Yet it should also
generate concern, for it can be seen as a powerful salvo in the conflict
over which government agencies will determine the scope of state
responses to environmental crisis, a conflict which with the resources
available to them (including the normative resources generated by the
claim to provide the overarching public good of security) national
security agencies are well placed to win. Neo-realists generally have
very little to say about such matters, intent as they are on evacuating
realism of normative content. (Although it is worth remembering that
they are typically skeptical of the discursive extension of \'security\'
beyond its traditional narrow confine, and as such they implicitly
endorse the critique of securitization). While [some realists have been
complicit in the creation of a climate of fear,]{.underline} both during
the Cold war and today, a number of the \'classical\' [realists were
extremely wary of the dangers of militarism, and the spreading threat to
democracy posed by the creeping expansion of the security-oriented
elements of the state.]{.underline} It was, after all, President
Eisenhower, a conservative realist, who warned of the dangers of the
\'military-industrial\' complex. Hans Morgenthau, as several
contributors to this book have argued, frequently insisted on the need
to carefully monitor the line between political and military power, and
to foster a civil society in which active dissent was seen as a positive
virtue of the citizenry, not as a threat to social solidarity or
political will.60 [Realism, then, at least contains some resources to
challenge securitization and threats to democracy.]{.underline}

### Security good 

**Rejection of securitization leads to instability and international
intervention**

2010, Critique, Security and Power: The political limits to emancipatory
approaches, pg. 127-129

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
**[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline}** as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. **[Here [we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In an international system which is
marked by great power inequalities between states, the **[rejection of
the]{.underline}** old narrow national interest-based [**security
framework**]{.underline} by major international institutions, **[and the
adoption of]{.underline}** ostensibly **[[emancipatory
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policy rhetoric, **[[has the
consequence of problematising weak or unstable states and allowing
international institutions or major states a more interventionary
role]{.underline}]{.mark}**, yet **[without establishing mechanisms by
which the citizens of states being intervened in might have any control
over the agents or agencies of their emancipation. Whatever the problems
associated with the pluralist security framework there were at least
formal and clear demarcations. This has the consequence of entrenching
international power inequalities and allowing for a shift towards a
hierarchical international order in which the citizens in weak or
unstable states may arguably have even less freedom or power than
before]{.underline}**. Radical critics of contemporary security
policies, such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue
that we see an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal
subjectivities in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield's
important and insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about
contemporary international security and development. Duffield attempts
to provide a coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical
explanation of, these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on
state security, and the so-called merging of security and development
are often portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come
about because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly
that these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example,
the rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a
presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the
international and domestic spheres and led to an international
environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role
in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of
humanitarian intervention this is a good development, Duffield points
out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique
and Afghanistan. Duffield also draws out the problems of the retreat
from modernisation that is represented by sustainable development. The
Western world has moved away from the development policies of the Cold
War, which aimed to develop third world states industrially. Duffield
describes this in terms of a new division of human life into uninsured
and insured life. Whilst we in the West are 'insured' -- that is we no
longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we have welfare systems, a
modern division of labour and so on -- sustainable development aims to
teach populations in poor states how to survive in the absence of any of
this. **[Third world populations must be taught to be self-reliant, they
will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of course means the condemnation of
millions to a barbarous life of inhuman bare survival]{.underline}**.
Ironically, although sustainable development is celebrated by many on
the left today, by leaving people to fend for themselves rather than
developing a society wide system which can support people, sustainable
development actually leads to a less human and humane system than that
developed in modern capitalist states. Duffield also describes how many
of these problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of
human security. For Duffield, we can understand these shifts in terms of
Foucauldian biopolitical framework, which can be understood as a
regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in the
biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human
population (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human security are
for Duffield technologies of security which aim to create self-managing
and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which can then
survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being uninsured
as Duffield terms it) without causing security problems for the
developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal project
which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations globally.
Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new forms of
cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for human rights
as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst we are in agreement with
critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that **[[these new security
frameworks cannot be empowering, and ultimately lead to more power for
powerful states]{.underline}]{.mark},** we need to understand why these
frameworks have the effect that they do. We can understand that these
frameworks have political limitations without having to look for a
specific plan on the part of current powerful states. In new security
frameworks such as human security we can see the political limits of the
framework proposed by critical and emancipatory theoretical approaches.

### State K2 Fem Reform

#### The state is inevitable---Liberal state reform is possible and an effective arena for challenging patriarchy

**Connell '90**, former University Chair in the University of Sydney,
(Raewyn, "The State, Gender, and Sexual Politics: Theory and Appraisal,"
*Theory and Society*, Vol. 19, No. 5 (Oct., 1990), pp. 507-544)

[Is the state patriarchal? Yes]{.underline}, beyond any argument, on the
evidence dis- cussed above. It is not \"essentially patriarchal\" or
\"male\"; even if one could speak of the \"essence\" of a social
institution, this would exagger- ate the internal coherence of the
state. [Rather the state is historically patriarchal, patriarchal as a
matter of concrete social practices. State structures in recent history
institutionalize the European equation between authority and a
dominating masculinity; they are effectively con- trolled by men; and
they operate with a massive bias towards hetero- sexual men\'s
interests. At the same time the pattern of state patriarchy
changes.]{.underline} In terms of the depth of oppression and the
historical possibilities of resistance and transformation[, a fascist
regime is crucially different from a liberal one, and a liberal one from
a revolutionary one. The most favorable historical circumstance for
progressive sexual politics seems to be the early days of
social-revolutionary regimes;]{.underline} but the later
bureaucratization of these regimes is devastating. [Next best is a
liberal state with a reformist government; though reforms introduced
under its aegis are vulnerable in periods of reaction. Though the state
is patriarchal, progressive gender politics cannot avoid it. The
character of the state as the central institutionalization of power, and
its historical trajectory in the regulation and constitution of gender
relations, make it unavoidably a major arena for challenges to
patriarchy. Here liberal feminism is on strong ground. Becoming engaged
in practical struggles for a share of state power requires tactical
judgments about what developments within the state provide
opportunities. In the 1980s certain strategies of reform have had a
higher relative pay-off than they did before.]{.underline} In Australia,
for instance, the creation of a network of \"women\'s services\" was a
feature of the 1970s, and the momentum of this kind of action has died
away. Reforms that have few budgetary implications but fit in with other
state strategies, such as modernizing the bureaucracy, become more
prominent. [Equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination
legislation have been highlighted; decriminalizing homosexuality is
consistent with this.]{.underline}

### A2: Liberalism -\> War

#### Liberalism isn't the root cause of war \-\-- multiple other structures of politics cause a lot more war

\[Benno Gerhard **Teschke 2011**\] (Fatal attraction: a critique of Carl
Schmitt\'s international political and legal theory,", *International

//pyrex ultra

For [at the centre of the]{.underline} heterodox -- partly
post-structuralist, partly realist -- neo-Schmittian [analysis
stands]{.underline} the conclusion of The Nomos: [the thesis of a
structural and continuous relation between liberalism and
violence]{.underline} (Mouffe 2005, 2007; Odysseos 2007). [It suggests
that, in sharp contrast to the liberal-cosmopolitan programme of
'perpetual peace', the geographical expansion of liberal modernity was
accompanied by the intensification and de-formalization of war in the
international construction of liberal-constitutional states of law and
the production of liberal subjectivities as rights-bearing
individuals]{.underline}. Liberal world-ordering proceeds via the
conduit of wars for humanity, leading to Schmitt\'s 'spaceless
universalism'. In this perspective, a straight line is drawn from WWI to
the War on Terror to verify Schmitt\'s long-term prognostic of the 20th
century as the age of 'neutralizations and de-politicizations' (Schmitt
1993). But [this attempt to read the history of 20th century
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [in terms of a
succession of confrontations between the carrier-nations of liberal
modernity and the criminalized foes at its outer margins seems **unable
to comprehend the complexities** and specificities of 'liberal'
world-ordering]{.underline}, then and now. For in the cases of
Wilhelmine, Weimar and fascist Germany, the assumption that their
conflicts with the Anglo-American liberal-capitalist heartland were
grounded in an antagonism between liberal modernity and a recalcitrant
Germany outside its geographical and conceptual lines runs counter to
the historical evidence. For this reading presupposes that
late-Wilhelmine Germany was not already substantially penetrated by
capitalism and fully incorporated into the capitalist world economy,
posing the question of whether the causes of WWI lay in the capitalist
dynamics of inter-imperial rivalry (Blackbourn and Eley 1984), or in
processes of belated and incomplete liberal-capitalist development, due
to the survival of 're-feudalized' elites in the German state classes
and the marriage between 'rye and iron' (Wehler 1997). It also assumes
that the late-Weimar and early Nazi turn towards the construction of an
autarchic German regionalism -- Mitteleuropa or Großraum -- was not
deeply influenced by the international ramifications of the 1929 Great
Depression, but premised on a purely political--existentialist assertion
of German national identity. [Against a reading of the early 20th
century conflicts between 'the liberal West' and Germany as 'wars for
humanity' between an expanding liberal modernity and its political
exterior, there is **more evidence** to suggest that these
confrontations were interstate conflicts within the crisis-ridden and
nationally uneven]{.underline} capitalist [project of
modernity]{.underline}. [Similar objections and caveats to the binary
opposition between the Western discourse of liberal humanity against
non-liberal foes apply to the more recent period. For how can this optic
explain that the 'liberal West' **coexisted (and keeps coexisting)**
with a large number of pliant authoritarian client-regimes]{.underline}
(Mubarak\'s Egypt, [Suharto\'s Indonesia, Pahlavi\'s Iran, Fahd\'s
Saudi-Arabia]{.underline}, even Gaddafi\'s pre-intervention Libya, to
name but a few), [which were and are actively managed and supported by
the West as anti-liberal]{.underline} Schmittian [states of emergency,
with concerns for liberal subjectivities and Human Rights **secondary to
the strategic interests** of political and geopolitical stability and
economic access? Even in the more obvious cases of Afghanistan, Iraq,
and, now, Libya, the idea that Western intervention has to be conceived
as an encounter between the liberal project and a series of foes outside
its sphere seems to rely on a denial of their antecedent histories as
geopolitically and socially contested state-building projects in
pro-Western fashion, deeply co-determined by long histories of Western
anti-liberal colonial and post-colonial legacies]{.underline}. If these
states (or social forces within them) turn against their imperial
masters, the conventional policy expression is 'blowback'. And as the
Schmittian analytical vocabulary does not include a conception of human
agency and social forces -- only friend/enemy groupings and collective
political entities governed by executive decision -- [it]{.underline}
also [lacks the categories of analysis to comprehend the social dynamics
that drive the struggles around sovereign power and the eventual
overcoming, for example, of Tunisian and Egyptian states of emergency
**without US-led wars for humanity**]{.underline}. Similarly, [it seems
**unlikely** that the **generic idea** of liberal world-ordering and the
production of liberal subjectivities can actually explain why Western
intervention seems **improbable in some cases** (e.g. Bahrain,
Qatar]{.underline}, Yemen or Syria) [and more likely in others (e.g.
Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya)]{.underline}. Liberal
world-ordering consists of differential strategies of building,
coordinating, and drawing liberal and anti-liberal states into the
Western orbit, and overtly or covertly intervening and refashioning them
once they step out of line. [These are conflicts within a world, which
seem to push the term liberalism beyond its original meaning. The
generic]{.underline} Schmittian [idea of a liberal]{.underline}
'spaceless [universalism' sits uncomfortably with the realities of
maintaining an America-supervised 'infor-mal empire', which has to
manage a persisting interstate system in diverse and case-specific ways.
But it is this persistence of a worldwide system of states, which encase
national particularities, which renders challenges to American supremacy
**possible in the first place.**]{.underline}

**[Cuomo 96]{.underline}** (Chris, War Is Not Just an Event, Hypatia,

I propose that the constancy of militarism and its effects on social
reality be reintroduced as a crucial locus of contemporary feminist
attentions, and that feminists emphasize how wars are eruptions and
manifestations of omnipresent militarism that is a product and tool of
multiply oppressive, corporate, technocratic states.\' Feminists should
be particularly interested in making this shift because it better allows
consideration of the effects of war and militarism on women, subjugated
peoples, and environments. [While giving attention to the constancy of
militarism in contemporary life we need not neglect the importance of
addressing the specific qualities of direct, large-scale, declared
military conflicts]{.underline}. But the dramatic nature of declared,
large-scale conflicts should not obfuscate the ways in which military
violence pervades most societies in increasingly technologically
sophisticated ways and the significance of military institutions and
everyday practices in shaping reality. Philosophical discussions that
focus only on the ethics of declaring and fighting wars miss these
connections, and also miss the ways in which even declared military
conflicts are often experienced as omnipresent horrors. These approaches
also leave unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement
in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and
militarism. CONTINUES When [Peach]{.underline} discusses \"alternatives
to war,\" she [is clearly feferring to alternatives to entering into
war, or to participating in \"the escalation of conflicts.\" The
avoidance of eruptions of military violence is certainly
important]{.underline}, and Peach is correct that feminist insights
about conflict resolution could present significant recommendations in
this regard. However, feminist moral imagination cannot end there. In
thinking of alternatives to war, we need to continue to imagine
alternatives to militaristic economies, symbolic systems, values, and
political institutions. The task of constructing such alternatives is
far more daunting and comprehensive than creating alternatives to a
specific event or kind of event.

The alternative approach of neo-Schumpeterian economics (e.g., Hanusch
and Pyka 2007) challenges this quantitative orientation and instead
emphasizes the importance of qualitative aspects, which make fundamental
changes of economic structures over longer periods visible. [Without the
consideration of the qualitative levels of economic growth, the
quantitative figures cannot tell much about the massive technological
and socioeconomic developments]{.underline}. The neo-Schumpeterian
approach highlights that [innovations, market forces, structural change,
and urban ways of life are both part of the problem and part of the
solution]{.underline} to the sustainability problem.
[Innovation-triggered development generates both quantitative, i.e.,
income-increasing growth, and qualitative, i.e., structure-changing
development]{.underline}. [Only the creative solutions characteristic
for capitalistic-organized economies will enable to reform our future
economy in the sense of sustainability]{.underline}, thereby
[supporting]{.underline} the UN's [sustainability]{.underline} goals
[and simultaneously ensuring growth and development]{.underline}
(Mazzucato and Perez 2015). [The central role of innovation]{.underline}
in neo-Schumpeterian economics [highlights that]{.underline} abstinence
in the sense of [economic downscaling is neither the first nor the only
solution]{.underline}. This does not mean that all ideas of the
proponents of the camp are rejected: in perfect accordance, certain past
patterns like the high energy intensity of production because of too low
oil prices not covering the total environmental costs or so-called
planned obsolescence in consumption require urgent adjustments.
[Especially]{.underline} [concepts resulting in a more intensive use of
goods and therefore contributing to the economization of resources like
the sharing economy or displacing physical goods by digital goods are
promising. The same applies for closed-loop material cycles, recycling
systems, and intelligent waste avoidance and treatment.
These]{.underline} concepts are perfectly applicable to
[foster]{.underline} learning and [behavioral changes on the supply and
the demand side]{.underline}. The core idea of neo-Schumpeterian
economics, however, is the supply of and demand for new technological
solutions within a comprehensive economic transformation process (Geels
2002), i.e., [different goods and services are produced and demanded in
different]{.underline}, namely, [sustainable ways]{.underline}.
[Exploring and exploiting the technological possibilities]{.underline}
of the bioeconomy not only creates new investment opportunities but
[is]{.underline} also [the condition sine qua non for the required
socioeconomic and cultural changes]{.underline}. The [consumers'
acceptance of]{.underline} bio-based [products and their demand are
indispensable for a successful transformation]{.underline}. Innovations
and changed consumer attitudes are complementary conditions for the
creation of a sustainable production system. [Change can be
either]{.underline} of an [incremental]{.underline} type in terms of
small improvements step-by-step [along well-known technological
trajectories, or it can be fundamental, leading to structural changes
and the emergence of new and the disappearance of old
industries]{.underline}. To simplify, we assume in this chapter that
incremental technological changes are based on existing technological
solutions, whereas radical technological changes question major existing
production processes. They might lead to massive upheaval in the global
production system in the sense of creative destruction (Schumpeter
1943). Because this chapter deals with the fundamental transformation of
current production systems, [radical technological innovations are in
the spotlight which encompass the overcoming of the lock-in situation in
fossil fuels]{.underline} (Unruh 2000) [and the establishment of a
knowledge-based bioeconomy]{.underline} (Pyka 2017; Pyka and Buchmann
2016). Without doubt [this transformation process is radical,
qualitative, and long term]{.underline}. It was already in Business
Cycles, published in 1939, when Schumpeter revitalized Kondratieff's
theory of long waves in order to explain such processes as regular
processes in long-term economic development. His illustration of the
discontinuous nature of economic development is famous: "Add
successively as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a
railway thereby" (Schumpeter 1934, p. 64). So far, the literature
highlights five long waves: The beginning industrialization around the
year 1800 represented the first long wave and was fueled by the steam
engine and by cotton processing. Then, starting around the year 1850,
the widespread availability of steel and the diffusion of railways
constituted a second long wave. Again, in the early twentieth century,
this Kondratieff cycle was replaced by electricity and chemicals. In the
postwar period, the third long wave gained momentum by mass production
and the automobile as well as the petrochemical industries. Since then,
manufacturing activities built on oil as a second fossil fuel apart from
coal. From the 1980s, one refers to the fifth long wave, which is
reflected in the fast and ubiquitous diffusion and application of
information and communication technology. [Now, at the beginning of the
twenty-first century, another paradigmatic change is in the
air]{.underline}, [being characterized]{.underline}, however,
[by]{.underline} one major difference to previous situations of radical
change: whereas previous cycles were driven by technological bottlenecks
and their overcoming, in the twenty-first century, we face the vital
question of how to restore environmental sustainability of economic
activities. [The knowledge-based bioeconomy]{.underline} plays a key
role in this transformation process which, of course, like previous
radical changes, still is confronted by fundamental uncertainty (Knight
1921). The literature provides many alternative terms for the massive
change, shaking global production systems: Freeman (1991) and Dosi
(1982) call them techno-economic paradigm changes; Sahal (1985) uses
cartographic analogies and refers to technological guideposts that are
pointing to technological avenues. All authors highlight the
confrontation with profound changes economic systems are faced with over
longer periods of time, which question all established production
approaches. Not a single technology is responsible for this phenomenon
but several complementary developments that include, apart from a
package of mutually dependent technologies (e.g., combustion engine,
petrochemistry, assembly line production), numerous infrastructural
developments (e.g., road structure, filling station network), behavioral
changes (e.g., suburbs and commuter flow, shopping malls outside the
city centers), as well as institutional changes (e.g., spatial planning
and commuter allowance, etc.). The old paradigm will not be replaced by
the new one until all these elements interact. The neo-Schumpeterian
approach provides us with crucial hints on the process of the
forthcoming change. For this purpose, we discuss in the following
section how [innovations are supported by the discovery and successful
diffusion of new knowledge]{.underline}. Knowledge-based economies
organize innovation systems composed of different actors which establish
a creative environment for mutual learning and knowledge creation. [No
innovation would have ever been established if it had not attracted
consumers' interest and if it had not been leveraged by their purchasing
power]{.underline}. We will focus on these questions in Sect. 11.3.
Knowledge-based societies consider new concepts in the sense of
[responsible innovation]{.underline} that [are decisive in bringing an
entire economy on a new sustainable path-shaping growth and
development]{.underline}. Section 11.4 deals with the massive economic
impacts originating from these technological and knowledge-driven
changes. It requires, besides technological change, also institutional
change in a coevolutionary fashion, if new sustainable technologies are
to achieve the aspired transformation of the economic system. 11.2
Innovation Systems and Knowledge Neo-Schumpeterian scholars (e.g., Dosi
et al. 1988; Lundvall 1992, 1998; Nelson 1993) strongly emphasize the
systemic character of innovation processes. So-called innovation systems
are composed of different actors (companies, research institutions,
political actors, consumers, etc.) and linkages between these actors
(flows of goods, R&D cooperation, knowledge transfer relationships,
user-producer relationships, etc.). These linkages are required to
ensure mutual learning and common knowledge development to solve complex
innovation challenges. Such systems are characterized by their dynamic
and coevolutionary nature and are thus enormously complex, as both
actors and their knowledge and linkages and interactions between actors
may change over time. Dosi (1982) takes this systemic conception as a
starting point in defining technological paradigms as "\[...\] set of
procedures, or a definition of the 'relevant' problems and of the
specific knowledge related to their solution." Transferred to the
knowledge-based bioeconomy, the core idea is substitution, i.e.,
replacing carbon-based materials and energy with bio-based materials and
energy. This can only be achieved by applying a variety of technological
processes in the entire breadth and depth of the value-added chain. In
this process the exploration of economic complementarities in terms of
cross-fertilization of different knowledge fields matters. For example,
to a large extent, digitalization allows for an extension of value
chains by increasing the added value in new sustainable production
sectors in a CO2-neutral way (e.g., by electric mobility based on
renewables, by establishing so-called smart grids, etc.). The concept of
technological paradigms also illustrates that a paradigm shift is not
possible at any time. A window of opportunity will only occasionally be
opened and allow for a paradigm shift when several interconnected
technologies are established and the creation of conducive demand side
and institutional conditions happens simultaneously. This, of course,
also holds for the emergence of a new bioeconomic innovation system and
requires a sound balance of the various actors and their activities. For
this reason, we introduce the notion of a dedicated innovation system.
The theory of industrial life cycles, which emphasizes the strong
dynamics in the emergence and decline of industries, gives a first hint
on the meaning of the development of a dedicated innovation system
supporting the transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.
Typically, industrial development is divided into four stages: (1) a
development phase (new knowledge creates prerequisites for innovation),
(2) an entrepreneurial and growth phase (many market entries of smaller
innovative firms), (3) a saturation and consolidation phase (formation
of industrial standards, mergers, and acquisitions as well as market
exits), and (4) a downturn phase (oligopolistic competition in only less
innovative industries) (e.g., Audretsch and Feldman 1996). Although the
bioeconomy does not represent a well-defined industrial sector,
understanding the theory of industrial life cycles is of crucial
importance to govern the transformation process towards the
knowledge-based bioeconomy. Without doubt, the bioeconomy has to be
characterized as cross sectional. On the one hand, [several new sectors
will emerge, e.g., in the fields of bioplastic, waste management, or
biorefineries]{.underline}. On the other hand, [already existing sectors
in the fields of vehicle construction, battery technology,
pharmaceuticals, etc. will gain new momentum by the arrival of
bioeconomic approaches]{.underline}. Therefore, we argue that new
sectors will emerge by establishing bioeconomic technologies and
development dynamics of some already existing industries will receive
new impetus at the same time. [Adjustments of old and development of new
institutions]{.underline} (e.g., in Germany the Renewable Energy Act,
the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Law, etc.), [adjustments of
consumer habits, and the emergence of new educational
opportunities]{.underline} in terms of coevolution [will accompany these
processes and establish]{.underline} the institutional, the industrial,
and the consumer pillars of [a dedicated innovation system]{.underline}.
The patterns and nature of new businesses in the bioeconomy are thus
strongly influenced by national institutions and organizations (Casper
et al. 1999; Whitley 1999). Institutions are defined as "a set of rules,
formal or informal, that actors generally follow, whether for normative,
cognitive, or material reasons." "Organizations are durable entities
with formally recognized members, whose rules also contribute to the
institutions of the political economy" (North 1990; Hall and Soskice
2001). In this interplay between organizations and institutions, the
knowledge base of an economy is created by the education and research
system and represents one of the most important prerequisites for the
transformation towards a bioeconomic production system (Geels 2002).
This automatically relates to a high level of uncertainty in particular
concerning the required future competences. In this complex process,
numerous individual knowledge fields are potentially relevant for the
transformation and are already identified, e.g., synthetic chemistry,
process engineering, genetic engineering, food technology, or
informatics. It is decisive to understand the dynamics of these
knowledge fields and the possibilities of their recombination with other
knowledge fields and adequate actors in order to create an innovation
system. In many cases, linkages of different knowledge fields
(cross-fertilization) are responsible for the emergence of extensive
technological opportunities: for instance, a complete new industry,
bioinformatics, has been initiated by the fusion of two so far unrelated
knowledge fields, database technology and molecular biology. Because
linking different knowledge fields is highly uncertain, private actors
might not start and governmental innovation policies matter. Knowledge
about future potentials, therefore, is essential for supporting research
and innovation policies: the analysis of knowledge and network dynamics
allows for the identification of development trajectories showing
sectors requiring public attention and support concerning research and
development in order to close existing knowledge gaps and build bridges
between various knowledge domains (Burt 2004; Zaheer and Bell 2005).
11.3 Innovation in Knowledge-Based Societies It has already been
mentioned that also consumer knowledge plays an important role for the
development and establishment of sustainable consumption patterns in a
knowledge-based bioeconomy (Geels 2002). Therefore, the analysis of the
transformation process has to include the interaction of technological
development, demand, and acceptance of innovative solutions as well as
sociological variables. The latter include education, age, income, and
gender. All are important explanatory factors determining attention and
readiness to deal with bioeconomic issues. A bioeconomic innovation will
only be successful when consumers accept it. The direction of the
transformation process is, comparable to the importance of the policy
realm, determined by consumers, i.e., an important question has to
address consumers' openness to the bioeconomy and its products. Finally,
(real and virtual) social networks matter for the establishment of new
consumption patterns. They can contribute significantly to a diffusion
of consumers' behavioral patterns and values (Robertson et al. 1996;
Valente 1996; Nyblom et al. 2003; Deffuant et al. 2005). Recent studies
show that attitudes are substantial for the development of social
relationships and that, in turn, social relationships considerably
influence behavior and attitudes. In the field of renewable energies,
for example, the initiative of municipal utilities' customers has led in
many cases to a "green" orientation of regional power supply. In some
cases, citizens' networks finally transformed to investment companies
that are engaged in wind farms. Critical issues are to be dealt with in
democratic processes in order to be widely accepted. Not everything that
is technically possible is also socially desirable. In the field of the
bioeconomy, this may, for instance, include the use of genetically
modified organisms in agriculture. In fact, these organisms promise
efficiency advantages with regard to the consumption of land and water,
etc., but their long-term health and environmental risks cannot be
completely (as with any new technology) anticipated. Accordingly,
technological developments require consumers' acceptance and thus depend
on the level of education in an economy. This raises the question of a
society's openness towards innovations that are fundamentally associated
with uncertainty. The concept of responsible innovation summarizes the
future-oriented organization of development and is currently discussed
with a high priority by European policy makers and institutions. A
comprehensive working definition has been developed by Von Schomberg
(2011). He describes responsible innovation as "a transparent,
interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become
mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical)
acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the
innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a
proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our
society)." This means that innovations are not exclusively evaluated by
their economic efficiency, but different aspects (e.g., consumer
protection or ecological aspects; see Schlaile et al. 2017) also matter
and are to be evaluated. Discussions on biofuels ("fuel vs. food") show
that both a pure economic and a one-dimensional ethical perspective are
not sufficient. The quality of these discussions depends on the
discussants' mutual understanding which in turn depends on the
participants' level of knowledge. Modern plant breeding and production
of seeds are bioeconomy fields of innovation in which issues of
responsibility are discussed frequently and controversially. German
consumers are skeptical about interference with the genome of food
crops, but individual points of criticism remain unclear. New breeding
techniques introduced, e.g., genome editing, enable scientists to
selectively modify DNA strands of crop plants. These techniques are
considered innovative as they may allow breeding of potentially
efficient plants in fast and cheap ways. Species developed this way
hardly differ from those of conventional breeding. The Central Advisory
Committee for Biological Safety does not classify these techniques as
genetic engineering, especially because no new combinations of genetic
material are made. As the Genetic Engineering Act does not explicitly
address these techniques, legal clarification is still necessary as to
whether these techniques are classified as genetic engineering at all.
Dissemination potential and acceptance are influenced by this result.
Here again, the necessity to include education and information policies
becomes evident to support the transformation towards a knowledge-based
bioeconomy. The concept of social innovation (e.g., Hanusch and Pyka
2013) emphasizes the importance of active citizenship in innovation.
Thus, according to the understanding of the European Commission, this
term includes innovations that are social, both in relation to their
objective and their instruments. In particular, this includes
innovations referring to the development and the application of new
ideas (for products, services, and models), covering at the same time
social demand and creating new social relationships or collaborations.
The whole society should benefit and contribute to generate new impetus
for improvement. Social innovations can make a major contribution to
rural development and promote economic resilience in these regions by
strengthening cooperative behavior. Rural cooperatives (e.g., regional
producer and marketing associations, winegrowers' cooperatives, tourism
associations, etc.) can help to develop regional competitiveness
considering ecological and social aspects. As a consequence, within the
framework of a bioeconomy, rural regions that are notably affected by
the already imminent demographic change and subsequent depopulation
receive new opportunities for economic development. 11.4 The Economics
of Change The sections above illustrate that a transformation of the
prevailing economic system towards a bioeconomy is an extremely complex
process. Various different actors participating in different roles are
contributing different pieces of knowledge. In this process, [innovative
adjustments in already existing industries as well as the emergence of
new and the disappearance of mature industries can be observed
simultaneously]{.underline}. In addition to the substitutive relations
of new bio-based industries to traditional oil-based industries, [there
are numerous essential complementary relations giving further momentum
for the transformation process]{.underline}. First and foremost, [there
are the possibilities and application fields of digitalization.
Digitalization allows to replace many oil-based products and
energy-intensive services simply by bits and bytes]{.underline}.
Simultaneously, [digitalization offers a wide range of opportunities by
coordinating decentralized and very detailed]{.underline} bioeconomic
[technologies and processes such as energy production and distribution.
This affects the composition of individual sectors]{.underline} where a
coexistence of large diversified companies and small high-specialized
technology companies is a likely solution. Finally, [digitalization also
offers consumer platforms to efficiently organize "sharing economy"
approaches]{.underline}. Finally, successful knowledge generation and
diffusion of relevant bioeconomic knowledge depends on dynamic
innovation networks (Pyka 2002) in which different actors jointly share
and create new knowledge. The consumers, represented, for example, by
consumer associations or politics, will play a key role in these
innovation networks and will help to establish networks in early stages
of technology development. In a knowledge-based bioeconomy, [investment
and economic growth still represent a crucial element]{.underline} for
employment, international competitiveness, and income generation. The
bioeconomy can make important contributions to accelerate investments by
[providing new investment opportunities generated by fundamental
innovations and thereby bringing currently available large quantities of
liquidity to a productive use]{.underline}. This, in turn, [accelerates
the technological paradigm shift]{.underline} (Pérez 2010). [The time
path of the transformation process]{.underline} represents another
critical component and [has been explored only partially]{.underline} so
far. [On the one hand, it is high time to reduce carbon-based production
methods. On the other hand, there will be frictions in the
transformation process being caused]{.underline}, for example, by a lack
of specialists and required competences. In this context,
[the]{.underline} so-called [sailing ship effects]{.underline} (Howells
2002), frequently observed with radical innovations, [could be made of
good use]{.underline}. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
existence of the established sailing ship technology was threatened by
the arrival of new steam ships, shipbuilders---not having changed their
technologies for many decades, if not centuries---began to innovate
again. [Due to the threat of innovative technologies, adjustment
reactions in predecessor technologies can be observed with the aim to
prevent the ancient technologies to be quickly replaced. Such adjustment
reactions are, for example, fuel-efficient combustion engines and hybrid
technologies]{.underline} as a reaction to the emergence of electric
vehicles. [These adjustments are advantageous since they pursue the same
environmental objectives]{.underline} (e.g., inner-city fine dust and
noise reduction, etc.) [and thus provide more time to develop new
technologies]{.underline}. Accordingly, the transformation process will
for longer periods of time feature a coexistence of traditional and
bio-based industries. Furthermore, [it will be important to concurrently
steer the relevant innovation processes in traditional
technologies]{.underline}. This coexistence further increases
complexity. At the same time, innovation policy is given room for
maneuver and yet insufficiently developed technologies are prevented
from being introduced prematurely which might cause promising approaches
to fail.

One powerful message permeating the book, and which gives a forceful
explanation to Colin Crouch's punchy title is that: ["rather than a
mass-produced, slightly shrunk, and off-the-rack ideological suit,
neoliberalism is a bespoke outfit made from a dynamic fabric that
absorbs local color"]{.underline} (5). [Even under a full-out attack
against some of its basic assumptions]{.underline}, [such as the one
unleashed in the immediate wake of the global financial crisis,
neoliberalism proved resilient beyond its many architects' wildest
dreams. Its capacity to absorb, coopt and recast selected ideas of
oppositional social forces has been the]{.underline} most [valuable
asset guaranteeing its survival]{.underline}. Again, the comparison of
the responses to the crisis in Spain and Romania show such adaptability
in full.¶ [The socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero
tried to salvage the social-democratic legacies of the Spanish economy
by engineering a Keynesian rescue package. Only later, when the disaster
of the cajas became apparent and the emergency intensified, did
conservative PM Mariano Rajoy embrace more deregulation]{.underline} in
the labour market (inspired by the Hartz IV reform) and extensive cuts
in the public sector under the strong external pressure of the European
Central Bank and of international financial markets.¶ [In Romania, local
policymakers further radicalized in the aftermath of the Lehman
Brothers' crisis, thereby outbidding the IMF on austerity and structural
reforms. Instead of shielding lower-income groups, the opposite strategy
of upward redistribution was chosen]{.underline}. By heroically
withstanding the external attempts at moderation, the Romanian economy
retained an unenviable mix of libertarian achievements (flat-tax rates),
experimental neoliberalism (privatized pensions) and mainstream
neoliberal orthodoxy (sound finance, labour market deregulation, social
policy targeting, privatization of all public companies). Pure
laissez-faire ideas such as the replacement of the welfare state by a
voluntary, private, Christian charity system were not unheard of.¶
Hence, through an insightful analysis of the ideational underpinnings of
its local interpretations, this book shows us that[, despite the
challenges, neoliberalism is alive and kicking]{.underline}. Ban guides
us through half a century of policymaking in Spain and Romania, and
embeds his analysis within the related nuances of contemporary liberal
economic thought. The research is a valuable addition to a growing
literature on the origin of current ideational frames and comfortably
sits alongside contemporary classics, such as Mark Blyth's Austerity:

[In this provocative essay, Marco Rosaire Rossi challenges Murray
Bookchin\'s fundamental claim that capitalism\'s lifeblood is unfettered
gro]{.underline}wth. Contrary to radical wisdom, **[Rossi writes, if we
are to build an ecological society we will need more growth, not
less]{.underline}**. [De-growth in a time of austerity is morally
reprehensible and material prosperity must be increased; the Industrial
Revolution must be rapidly advanced. Without this progress, humanity
**will only remain at the threshold** of an ecological society and no
more]{.underline}. It has become almost cliché to remark that human
civilization is facing an existential crisis unparalleled in history. It
is almost cliché, but not quite, because to refer to it as cliché does a
disservice to the extensiveness of the problem; and yet, calling it a
cliché somehow speaks to the banality of the apocalyptic cries. From
across the political spectrum, there is a sense that "The End Is Nigh,"
and after "Nigh" has lasted many years---for some, even decades---a
sense of apathetic dread sinks in. The world is going to die, it has
been dying for years, and apparently there is nothing anyone can do
about it. This acedia of apathetic dread is based both in reality and in
ideology. The reality is that the planet is experiencing a major threat
in the form of global warming. Our global economic system has put itself
in violent opposition to any ecological parameters. The major
disruptions of global warming still loom over the horizon; yet, their
immanence means that we need to consider the consequences of increasing
humanity's material prosperity. [Billions of people need to be pulled
out of poverty, but if doing so ends up sending the planet off a cliff
then it makes little sense to do just that. At the same time, billions
of people are living in abject poverty. Chilling ourselves to their
plight out of ecological concern requires a dimming of our sense of
humanity. In halting material prosperity we may save the planet but in
the process we kill our humanity.]{.underline} Development or
Sustainability? The ideological source of this apathetic dread is the
Morton's Fork between material security and ecological sustainability to
begin with. [Ideologically, there appears to be an inability to imagine
a society that is materially secure, even prosperous, and ecologically
sustainable.]{.underline} Finding a loving marriage between technology
and ecology is at the center of many of our ecological and social
problems[. New technologies must allow ecosystems to become more diverse
and stable, and that environmental diversity and stability must be used
in such a way that it allows humans the time and leisure to engage in
even more sophisticated technological pursuits.]{.underline} What
environmentalists have failed to cultivate when it comes to nature is
the same sense of progress that seems instinctual to a modernist
understanding of technology, thus their opposition. [Since the birth of
the environmental movement the entire approach to the natural world has
been one of conservation.]{.underline} A pristine, romantic, and often
spiritual approach to the natural world has meant that
[environmentalists have adopted a savior psychology to their
activism]{.underline}. Nature, in its innocence, cannot be polluted with
civilization. It must be saved from the inherent capriciousness of
humanity through prohibitions and austerity. **[This one-sided approach
to environmentalism not only ignores the vitality and resilience of the
natural world, but also establishes an "otherness" between humanity and
nature that reinforces humanity's alienation to the natural
world]{.underline}**. In [the hopes of bringing the "arrogance of man"
down to the level of nature, environmentalists have duplicated the very
dichotomy that they oppose but with one important twist: Nature is
supposed to reign over society]{.underline}, and it should reign even if
the supremacy of nature means that certain people in society must be
made desolate. **[Ecology should not, and cannot, be a synonym for
misanthropy]{.underline}**. [Civilization does have the potential to
destroy nature, but it also has the potential to restore and complement
it.]{.underline} The modern world has endowed us with both unprecedented
destructive capacities and liberating potentialities. [Moreover, modern
technology has shown us the means to not only liberate humans from the
harsh conditions of the natural world, but also to liberate the natural
world from a harsh and myopic civilization]{.underline}. [Before the use
of coal fed the Industrial Revolution, the main source of energy in the
world was wood]{.underline}. Wood is an extraordinarily inefficient
source of energy that releases a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. [If
the European need for wood had not transferred to coal---and there was
no reason to suspect that it would have slowed down---then all of Europe
would have been deforested, and we would still be dealing with the
problem of climate change.]{.underline} The fossil fuel economy saved
humanity from this travesty. Fossil fuels, though problematic in our own
time, are far denser forms of energy. They do not require a massive
project of deforestation to extract. The movement beyond fossil fuels
continues along the same lines as the movement beyond wood, that is, the
search for denser and more efficient forms of energy. This project can
only come about through the advancement of technological and scientific
progress, a furthering of the Industrial Revolution, not its retraction.
[Similarly, our economy is potentially going through a subtle process of
dematerialization that is forcing a reassessment of the relationship
between industrial and postindustrial societies]{.underline}. **[We are
able to generate more wealth, with less stuff, more
efficiently]{.underline}**. In the developing world, many countries are
still experiencing materializing economies, but---as the developed
nations dematerializes---there appears to be a point when economic
development reaches past material security and into intellectual and
cultural achievements. [Consumerism is to be feared when it becomes a
substitute for social creativity. **Consumption, in contrast, is not
just metabolically necessary, but socially desirable.**]{.underline}
[The sociability of a farmers' market or craft fair indicates that there
is an innate participatory aspect to consumption that goes beyond
avaricious conceptions of humanity as automaton pigs with bottomless
stomachs. People consume the most when they are in groups, and yet our
consumption is the least material when it is the most
communal.]{.underline} The greatest ecological transformation that the
modern world has brought is the migration of people from villages to
cities and the bifurcation of rural and urban life. [From an ecological
perspective, cities, with their geographical density and tightly
interwoven economies, create an ideal situation for harmonizing the
social and the natural world]{.underline}. [Cities enable rich cultural
lives and they do so at a minimum of ecological
consequences.]{.underline} Stacking homes in apartment buildings and
concentrating human activity within a walkable distance requires an
intense alteration of an ecological landscape, but that landscape is
extremely small, and uses a fraction of the resources used by sprawling
suburbs. In turn, the movement to the cities has been matched and
encouraged by startling technological innovations in agriculture. The
sustainable intensification that has happened through the creation of
the modern city is also happening on the modern farm. Food production
has reached heights undreamed of a hundred years ago, and it has done so
with a fraction of the labor power and a slowing down of the need for
more land. The ability to produce more with less has meant that a feral
nature has been able to bounce back. The social and the natural world
are cobbling together a lasting peace within a strategic division
between urban, rural, and feral landscapes. [These important trends give
hope to reconciling technology and ecology but they are not inevitable.
Apathetic dread should not be replaced by euphoric naiveté. These trends
have only developed through an effort to modernize civilization. This
includes pursuing a secular and scientific worldview that values
innovation and technological achievements, but it also includes
expanding democratic governance, ensuring social and economic equality,
and encouraging cosmopolitan perspectives. Dealing with our current
ecological crisis means that we must recognize that our inability to
move from fossil fuels to other sources of energy is rooted in stubborn
**institutional arrangements** that do not respond more to the
imperatives hierarchical management and market competition than human
and ecological needs do.]{.underline} Capitalism: No friend of growth
Global warming is a market failure of potentially catastrophic
proportions. The carbon released into the earth's atmosphere is
externalized from the transactions within our economy, and this
externalization means that the cost of this pollution is placed on
future generations and the environment. The pursuit of developing
nations to have a living standard on par with that of developed nations
is thought to be at the heart of this market failure, but that is a
misplaced analysis. Free market libertarians and Luddite eco-socialists
alike have thought that economic development was a byproduct of
capitalism. This assumption ignores the reality that the areas of the
world that have been forced to deal with the fiercest free-market
conditions are the areas of the world that have been the most
chronically underdeveloped. Developing nations have only been able to
shake off the yoke of imperialism through establishing planned
economies, industrial policies, and social safety nets that prevent the
self-destructive tendencies of markets. [For decades, pioneering social
ecologists such as Murray Bookchin warned environmentalists and
political radicals of a coming ecological collapse initiated by
capitalist modes of production. For Bookchin it was capitalism's
"grow-or-die" ethos that inexorably linked the market economy to the
simplification and eventual destruction of complex life, including
humani]{.underline}ty. **[Bookchin got the problem right, but the causal
mechanism wrong.]{.underline}** Indeed, capitalist modes of production
are at the heart of much of our current ecological problems, but it is
not because capitalism inherently promotes economic growth. If there is
one major lesson that should be drawn from post-World War II economic
history, especially from our own globalized neoliberal era, it is that
the economic growth unleashed by unfettered free markets is quite
limited. Free market capitalism does not seem to operate along the lines
of "grow-or-die," but instead along the lines of "grow-then-die,"
meaning that macroeconomic growth under capitalism is hindered by the
same anarchic market forces that lead to its initial paroxysm. **[And it
is the periods of economic destruction---where there are continual
recessions and extreme social volatility---that pose the greatest
threats to our ecology]{.underline}**. [It is in those periods when it
is the most difficult for people to understand that the fate of humanity
is intimately tied to the fate of the natural world, and when people are
least inclined to use additional resources to explore newer, more
environmentally sustainable technologies.]{.underline} Capitalism is at
the heart of our ecological crisis not because it develops economies,
but for the very fact that it does the opposite. Joseph Schumpeter's
plucking of the term "creative destruction" from Marxists has both
enlightened and obfuscated our conceptual understanding of economic
development and its relation to technology. For Schumpeter, largely
drawing on Marxist writings on capitalism, creative destruction referred
to periods of economic development where an old world was destroyed to
make way for the prosperity of a new one. His meaning is more akin to
the Hegelian notion Aufhebung, a concept that is always underneath
Marx's work, than to the mechanistic repetition of collapse and
regeneration of the business cycle that free-market apologists have
emphasized. The exogenous factor for these economic upheavals was the
introduction of new technologies, ones that were able to internalize
externalities, create efficiencies, and thus undermine all previous
forms of competition, even monopolistic forms. Schumpeter was correct in
recognizing the inherent developmental nature within economies and the
important role of technological progress as in usurping a given economic
order, but his willingness to attribute this progress to capitalists,
specifically large corporations and monopolistic entities, clouds the
actual nature of this economic development. The increasing complexity of
economic transactions and technological innovation demand that those
periods of creative destruction become less driven by lone inventors and
more the result of collective institutions and mass social cooperation.
[The belief that capitalism, as an ethical framework, can save itself by
its own innovation ignores the stark reality that to produce such
innovation in complex modern societies capitalist ethics must be
violated, sometimes violently so. Marx and Engels were correct: there is
a disjunction between modes of production that require increasingly
cooperative institutions and an economic system that promotes an extreme
individualistic ethos above all else. But, their focus on the birth of
factory labor out of feudal artisanship was myopic. Capitalism's
inconsistencies arise not only within the factory, where the cooperation
of workers to produce goods is at odds with the individual ownership of
the factory by capitalists, but also in society at large, where the
demands for modern technological innovation require huge economies of
scale and cooperation between workers in entire industries. In this way,
economies have developed despite private ownership and hierarchical
forms of management, not because of them.]{.underline} As the Solow-Swan
growth model has shown, the main engine for economic growth in developed
nations, at least since World War II, has been the introduction of
technological innovation. In this same period, the primer for this
engine has been public sector spending. It [is the public sector that
has played the most critical role in economic development through
planning economies and allocating resources toward research and
development. Unfortunately, the public, disengaged from their political
institutions by a sprawling hierarchical class of bureaucrats and
professional politicians, have allowed a parasitic private sector to
profit from this innovation and to direct this allocation in a manner
that best serves them]{.underline}. Regardless though, modern capitalist
prosperity has only been able to occur through shadow socialism. The
irony of all modern entrepreneurs is that none of them would have been
able to innovate without the aid of the state. Socialism, democracy and
equality **[The question then beckons: why should socialism remain in
the shadows? What is needed to deal with the crisis of global warming is
not policies of planned economic de-growth that mimic rightwing
austerity under a socialists facade, but rapid and sustainable economic
growth through embracing technological innovations that reconcile the
tension between society and nature]{.underline}**. A great confusion has
overcome both the acolytes and adversaries of capitalism. "Capitalism"
as a particular mode of production has become so synonymous with
economics in general that any economic growth is seen as capitalist
economic growth, regardless of its context or results. [In actuality,
capitalism is an example of an alienated economy where the vast majority
of its participants---that is to say, workers and consumers---are
unaware of their true economic potential. The ultimate form of "creative
destruction" regarding capitalism is the technological and economic
development out of capitalism itself. The humanist desire for continuous
and sustainable economic development, the constant pursuit for
ecologically sound and cooperative forms of production and consumption
is a threat to capitalism, not the apex of its expression. Polemical
calls for economic de-growth in a world where the majority of people
still live in abject poverty are worse than strategically inept; they
are morally reprehensible and politically asphyxiating.]{.underline}
Democracy, especially sophisticated forms of direct democracy, cannot
advance without increasing material prosperity. Since the time of
Aristotle, it has been recognized that for democracy to function there
must be a degree of leisure time spent among the population. No robust
public life can be established in a society where material scarcity
causes people to devote the majority of their time to securing the
fundamental means of subsistence. Further, a society where technologies
have reduced, and in some cases eliminated, odious tasks liberates
people to engage in higher cultural functions, including their own
self-management and governance. This is especially the case for those
who have been traditionally denied access to the public sphere. Despite
its necessity for its time, the eighteenth-century cry that "we are all
born equal" has become an ossified platitude. The reality is that we are
not all born equal. Nature produces grave inequalities between us in
ability. Morality demands that we rectify these inequalities by creating
new opportunities, both socially and materially, for all. [There is a
dialectical relation between social equality and technological
innovation. Modern feminism would have an entirely different meaning if
breakthroughs in contraceptive technologies were not established by the
mid-twentieth century. The case is similar for the elderly, for
transgender individuals, for people with disabilities, children, and
nations established in areas of the world with a dearth of natural
resources. **In each situation, the interaction between social struggles
and technological innovations has led to greater social inclusion**.
People are not born equal, rather, they are perpetually made and remade
equal by continuous efforts at social uplift and
prosperity.]{.underline} Conclusion There is no reason to doubt that
such "equalizing" efforts could not only continue but be advanced into
the ecological realm. [Modern technologies and the growth of material
prosperity have within them the potential to "uplift" the
environment]{.underline}. Far from being a matter of mere conservation,
environmental sustainability in the modern world is a twin-cousin to
development economics. Influenced by the work of soft deep ecologists
such as Bill McKibben, many environmentalists have lamented the "end of
nature" and arrival of the Anthropocene, fearing that it signifies the
beginning of the end for biodiversity. [No doubt, the Anthropocene has
this potential, but it also has another potential. Through modeling its
environment to ensure human prosperity while at the same time organizing
its social institutions to guarantee environmental stewardship, humanity
has a historical opportunity that is unprecedented among any species on
that planet. Humanity can escape its Malthusian traps through
continually enriching, rather than simplifying, it surrounding
environment. Its flourishing as a species could be a boon for
biodiversity rather than its dwindling]{.underline}. [There needs to be
a conscious social reconfiguration that utilizes denser forms of energy,
dematerializes economies, and geographically decouples humanity from
nature within a triad of urban, rural, and feral
development]{.underline}. **[If such a reconfiguration where to occur it
would mean a massive expansion of economic growth through the unleashing
of humanity's technological and scientific potential]{.underline}**. The
complexity of such a project can only happen through the type of large
participatory planned economy that socialists have always advocated for.
[All capitalists have a vested interest in protecting their business
model, even if such a model is based on an obsolete technology that is
destroying the planet. The only way societal development can avoid
getting bogged down in the obstinate interests of capitalists is if
economic interests become the general interest of all. That is only
possible in a democratic economic system that values the participation
and perspective of each individual, in community, instead of the will of
one class over another]{.underline}

### Overperscribe Neoliberalism

#### Critical theories of neoliberalism reduce nuances to binaries and use the same moralistic register they critique \-\-- they lack serious insight into structural prescriptions.

[Critical theories of neoliberalism]{.underline} and neoliberalization
[provide a compelling moral narrative in which recent history is
understood in terms of a motivated shift away from public and collective
values towards private and individualistic values. Critical narratives
of neoliberalism reinforce the image of there being a clear-cut divide
between]{.underline} two sets of values -- those of [private,
individualistic self-interest]{.underline} on the one hand,
[and]{.underline} those of [public, collective interests]{.underline} on
the other. [There is a preconstructed normative framing of these
theories around a set of conceptual and moral binaries: market versus
state; public versus private; consumer versus citizen; liberty versus
equality; individual utility versus collective solidarity;
self-interested egoism versus other-regarding altruism. Theories of
neoliberalism go hand in hand with a standard form of criticism that
bemoans the decline of public life, active citizenly virtue, and values
of egalitarianism and solidarity. **These theories project ahead of
themselves criteria of evaluation**]{.underline} (cf. Castree 2008):
neoliberalism reduces democracy, creates poverty and inequality, and is
imposed either from the outside or by unaccountable elites. [The
conceptual analysis of neoliberalism is therefore always already
critical, but at a cost. They are condemned to invoke their favoured
positive values]{.underline} (e.g. [the public realm, collective
solidarity, equality, democracy, care, social justice) **in a moralistic
register without addressing normative problems of how practically to
negotiate equally compelling values**.]{.underline} And in so far as
[theories of neoliberalism dismiss considerations of rational action,
motivation, and decentralised coordination as]{.underline} so much
[**'ideology'**, they remain chronically constricted in their capacity
to reflect seriously on questions of institutional design, political
organisation and economic coordination which, one might suppose, remain
an important task for any critical theory.]{.underline}

### A2: Endless War

**Endless war impact isn't a thing**

**Teschke**, Sussex IR professor, **2011** (Benno-Gerhard, "Fatal
attraction: a critique of Carl Schmitt\'s international political and
legal theory", International Theory,
https://historicalsociology.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/teschke-benno-2011-fatal-attraction-a-critique-of-carl-schmitts-international-political-and-legal-theory.pdf)

For at the centre of the heterodox -- partly post-structuralist, partly
realist -- neo-Schmittian analysis stands the conclusion of The Nomos:
the **[thesis]{.underline}** of a structural and continuous relation
between liberalism and violence (Mouffe 2005, 2007; Odysseos 2007). It
**[suggests]{.underline}** that, in sharp contrast to the
liberal-cosmopolitan programme of 'perpetual peace', the geographical
**[expansion of liberal modernity was accompanied by]{.underline}** the
**[intensification]{.underline}** and de-formalization **[of war in
the]{.underline}** international **[construction of]{.underline}**
liberal-constitutional states of law and the production of **[liberal
subjectivities]{.underline}** as rights-bearing individuals. [Liberal
world-ordering proceeds via the conduit of wars for
humanity]{.underline}, leading to Schmitt\'s 'spaceless universalism'.
In this perspective, [**a straight line is drawn from WWI to the War on
Terror to verify Schmitt\'s long-term prognostic** of the 20th century
as the age of 'neutralizations and de-politicizations']{.underline}
(Schmitt 1993). **[But this attempt to read the history of 20th century
international relations in terms of a succession of confrontations
between the carrier-nations of liberal modernity and the criminalized
foes at its outer margins seems unable to comprehend the complexities
and specificities of 'liberal' world-ordering, then and
now]{.underline}**. For in the cases of Wilhelmine, Weimar and fascist
Germany, the assumption that their conflicts with the Anglo-American
liberal-capitalist heartland were grounded in an antagonism between
liberal modernity and a recalcitrant Germany outside its geographical
and conceptual lines runs counter to the historical evidence. For this
reading presupposes that late-Wilhelmine Germany was not already
substantially penetrated by capitalism and fully incorporated into the
capitalist world economy, posing the question of whether the causes of
WWI lay in the capitalist dynamics of inter-imperial rivalry (Blackbourn
and Eley 1984), or in processes of belated and incomplete
liberal-capitalist development, due to the survival of 're-feudalized'
elites in the German state classes and the marriage between 'rye and
iron' (Wehler 1997). It also assumes that the late-Weimar and early Nazi
turn towards the construction of an autarchic German regionalism --
Mitteleuropa or Großraum -- was not deeply influenced by the
international ramifications of the 1929 Great Depression, but premised
on a purely political--existentialist assertion of German national
identity. Against a reading of the early 20th century conflicts between
'the liberal West' and Germany as 'wars for humanity' between an
expanding liberal modernity and its political exterior, there is more
evidence to suggest that these confrontations were interstate conflicts
within the crisis-ridden and nationally uneven capitalist project of
modernity. Similar **[objections]{.underline}** and caveats **[to the
binary opposition between]{.underline}** the Western discourse of
**[liberal humanity]{.underline}** against non-liberal foes
**[apply]{.underline}** to the more recent period. For **[how can
this]{.underline}** optic **[explain that the 'liberal
West']{.underline}** coexisted (and keeps **[coexisting) with a large
number of pliant authoritarian client-regimes]{.underline}** (Mubarak\'s
Egypt, Suharto\'s Indonesia, Pahlavi\'s Iran, Fahd\'s Saudi-Arabia, even
Gaddafi\'s pre-intervention Libya, to name but a few), which were and
are **[actively]{.underline}** managed and **[supported]{.underline}**
by the West **[as anti-liberal]{.underline}** Schmittian states of
emergency, **[with concerns for liberal subjectivities]{.underline}**
and Human Rights **[secondary to]{.underline}** the **[strategic
interests]{.underline}** of political and geopolitical stability and
economic access? Even **[in]{.underline}** the more obvious cases of
**[Afghanistan, Iraq, and]{.underline}**, now, **[Libya]{.underline}**,
the idea that **[Western intervention]{.underline}** has to be
**[conceived as]{.underline}** an encounter between the
**[liberal]{.underline}** project and a series of foes outside its
sphere seems to **[rely on a denial of their antecedent histories as
geopolitically and socially contested state-building projects in
pro-Western fashion, deeply co-determined by long histories of Western
anti-liberal colonial and post-colonial legacies]{.underline}**. If
these states (or social forces within them) turn against their imperial
masters, the conventional policy expression is 'blowback'. And as **[the
Schmittian]{.underline}** analytical vocabulary does not include a
conception of human agency and social forces -- only friend/enemy
groupings and collective political entities governed by executive
decision -- **[it]{.underline}** also lacks the categories of analysis
to comprehend the social dynamics that drive the struggles around
sovereign power and the eventual overcoming, for example, of Tunisian
and Egyptian states of emergency without US-led wars for humanity.
Similarly, **[it seems unlikely that]{.underline}** the
**[generic]{.underline}** idea of **[liberal
world-ordering]{.underline}** and the production of liberal
subjectivities **[can actually explain why]{.underline}** Western
**[intervention seems improbable in]{.underline}** some cases (e.g.
**[Bahrain]{.underline}**, Qatar, Yemen or Syria) **[and]{.underline}**
more **[likely in]{.underline}** others (e.g. Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq,
and **[Libya]{.underline}**). Liberal world-ordering consists of
differential strategies of building, coordinating, and drawing liberal
and anti-liberal states into the Western orbit, and overtly or covertly
intervening and refashioning them once they step out of line. These are
conflicts within a world, which seem to push the term liberalism beyond
its original meaning. The generic Schmittian idea of a liberal
'spaceless universalism' sits uncomfortably with the realities of
maintaining an America-supervised 'informal empire', which has to manage
a persisting interstate system in diverse and case-specific ways. But it
is this persistence of a worldwide system of states, which encase
national particularities, which renders challenges to American supremacy
possible in the first place.

#### No endless war \-\-- democracy solves

\[Jerel **Rosati and** James **Scott 2014**\] (*The Politics of United
States Foreign Policy*, 6th ed., p. 347-348, a Professor of
international studies and political science at the University of South
Carolina, a Professor of political science at Texas Christian
University) xx-xx-2014 //pyrex ultra

A second consequence, usually ignored by those who hold to the
traditional wisdom, is that [for]{.underline} some [issues]{.underline},
especially those [that are]{.underline} most [salient, public opinion
may act as an immediate and **direct constraint** on political
officials]{.underline} in the policymaking process. [No matter how
inattentive, uninformed, and erratic public opinion is, the public vote
political leaders in and out of office, so elected officials
are]{.underline} particularly [sensitive to public opinion]{.underline}.
Within the White House, it is not uncommon to hear people say that
"compared with analysts, presidents and potential presidents themselves
see a close link between stands in foreign policy and the outcomes of
presidential elections" (Halperin 1974:67). Even a casual review of the
past two decades reveals extensive efforts by each administration to
shape and cultivate public opinion and support (see Heilemann and
Halperin 2010 on the 2008 presidential election). Furthermore, [if
public feeling becomes intense concerning an issue, it severely
constrains the choices available]{.underline} within the policymaking
process. As Henry Kissinger (1957:328) once observed, "The acid test of
a policy...is its ability to obtain domestic support." Once the public
was educated and let on the issue of anticommunism, American leaders
began to feel constrained by public opinion, as cold war lessons---for
instance that the United States should take a hardline approach and
never appease aggressors---were internalized by Americans. The last
remnant of this anticommunist legacy in the present era can still be
seen in U.S. foreign policy toward North Korea and Cuba. In addition,
[public support for a policy may **turn rapidly** into public
disapproval]{.underline}. [Although the public tends to rally around the
flag]{.underline} and the president [during a crisis]{.underline} such
as war, public [support]{.underline} for presidential policies [tends to
**dwindle over time**]{.underline}. [Studies]{.underline}, such as John
Mueller's (1973) classic, War, Presidents, and Public Opinion,
[demonstrate that the longer a war lasts]{.underline} (and the greater
the casualties), [the more public support will **erode**]{.underline}.
Quick and successful operations, as in Grenada, Panama, the Persian
Gulf, and Kosovo maximize support; lengthy and unsuccessful conflicts,
as in Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, and Iraq bring public disapproval (see
Gelpi, Feaver, and Reiffler 2005/06). George W. [Bush learned how
quickly public approval can pivot as support changed to
opposition]{.underline} as time, cost and casualties mounted in Iraq
after 2003, and Barack Obama watched public support evaporate for his
initial economic policies as well as military action in Afghanistan.
Bruce Jentleson (1992:72) found that public opinion "varies according to
the 'principal policy objective' for which force is used." The tendency
is for greater public support for the use of force in order to "contain"
and "restrain" an aggressor state---such as in the Persian Gulf War---as
opposed to using force to "initiate" and "impose" internal political
change within another state---such as within Nicaragua, Somalia, or
Haiti. Obviously, many cases are likely to be, or be perceived as,
somewhat mixed. Nevertheless, Jentleson (1992:72) concludes: The
American public is less gun shy that during the Vietnam trauma period or
the 1970s, but more cautious than during the Cold War consensus of the
1950s and 1960s...[Presidents who contemplate getting militarily
involved in internal]{.underline} \[END OF PAGE 347\] [political
conflicts]{.underline}---of which there may well be even more in the
post-Cold War world than when bipolarity had its constraining
effects---[had better get in and out quickly and
successfully]{.underline}. [Otherwise, the public is **strongly
disposed** to oppose the policy]{.underline}. Thus [the public tends to
**discriminate** over the use of force more than is commonly thought and
is **"pretty prudent."**]{.underline} [As can be seen in the war in
Iraq, from overwhelming support in early 2003]{.underline} at the
beginning of the invasion, public support dwindled steadily---with
temporary interruptions for such events as the capture of Saddam Hussein
or the Iraqi elections in 2005---[to the point where over half the
public regarded the actions as a mistake by early 2005]{.underline}.
Similarly, the public's preference for withdrawal has also increased
steadily as casualties have mounted (Mueller 2005). In late 2005, for
example, [**polls** showed that, even while democracy promotion was
embraced]{.underline} by most Americans as a foreign policy goal, **[a
majority]{.underline}** of Americans [opposed the use of military
force]{.underline} (either directly or via threats) [to promote
democracy, and believed that the goal of establishing democracy in Iraq
did not warrant going to war]{.underline}. Finally, [the **collapse** of
the **cold war consensus**]{.underline} has [made public
opinion]{.underline} somewhat [less responsive to the
president]{.underline}. During the 1950s, most American leaders and
members of the elite public shared a similar cold war view of the world
that the mass public tended to follow. [Since]{.underline} the
[Vietnam]{.underline} War, however, [**differing views** of]{.underline}
the world and U.S. [foreign policy have arisen, leading to greater
diversity and volatility in]{.underline} public [opinion]{.underline}.
[This has made it]{.underline} more [**difficult** for the president to
**rally** and **maintain** public support]{.underline} for particular
polices in an environment where opinion leaders with different foreign
policy views now compete with each other for public support.

### A2: Bad AI

#### No runaway AI \-\-- it takes forever 

\[Toby **Walsh 17**\] (is a professor of artificial intelligence at the
University of New South Wales and the author of, \"Android Dreams: The
Past, Present and Future of AI\" (Hurst, £16.99)
<https://www.wired.co.uk/article/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-scaremongering>)
9-20-2017 //pyrex ultra

It seems you can't open a newspaper without Elon Musk predicting that
artificial intelligence (AI) needs regulating -- before it starts World
War III. And if it's not Elon, its Vladimir telling us AI will rule the
world. I'm starting to feel like I'm a very dangerous guy. That's
because I'm a professor of artificial intelligence. There was a time, 20
years back, when people just smiled at me when I told them I was working
on building intelligent machines. And I knew that smile was one of
sympathy. Back then, AI was simply so hopeless. But now, as AI begins to
make some progress, people seem to live in fear of the next thing that
will emerge from AI labs across the world. Elon is, in fact, right. AI
does need regulating. But he's also almost surely wrong -- **[AI isn't
going to start World War III anytime soon. Or rule the world. Or end
humanity]{.underline}**. AI needs regulating because the big tech
companies have got too big for their own good. And like every other
industry sector before it that has got too big -- the banks, the oil
companies, the telecom firms -- regulation is needed to ensure the
public good. To ensure that we all benefit and not just the tech elite.
We're beginning to see the corrosive effects of Facebook's algorithms on
political debate, of Amazon's dominance of the retail sector, and of
Google's monopoly on search. And it's hard to know where to begin with a
company like Uber. There's just so much to criticise. However, the
[problems today are not caused by super smart AI, but stupid
AI]{.underline}. We're letting algorithms make decisions that impact on
society. And these algorithms are not very smart. Joshua Brown
discovered this to his cost last year when he became the first person
killed by his autonomous car. In fact, a smarter car might have seen the
truck turning across the road and saved his life. [There's a very
seductive and dangerous idea that is getting people like Elon all worked
up: the idea of the \"technological singularity\".]{.underline} At some
point, we'll build machines sufficiently smart that they'll be able to
re-design themselves to be even smarter. And these smarter machines will
then re-design themselves again. This will signify a tipping point, when
machine intelligence snowballs away. Before we know it, we'll no longer
be the smartest creatures on the planet. And if we're not careful, these
machines will use their superior intelligence to take over the planet.
Just as we used our intelligence to take over the planet from the apes,
the dolphins and the dinosaurs before us. Now, the first thing you need
to know about the singularity is that it is [an idea mostly believed by
people not working in artificial intelligence]{.underline}. [People like
the philosopher]{.underline} Nick [Bostrom]{.underline}, [and the
futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil. Most]{.underline} people [working in
AI]{.underline} like myself [have a healthy skepticism for the idea of
the singularity]{.underline}. **[We know how hard it is to get even a
little intelligence into a machine, let alone enough to achieve
recursive self-improvement. There are many technical reasons why the

AlphaGo isn't going to wake up tomorrow and decide humans are useless at
Go, and instead opt to win some money at online poker. And it is
certainly not going to wake up and decide to take over the planet. It's
not in its code. All AlphaGo will ever do is maximise one number: its
estimate for the probability it will win the current game of Go. Indeed,
it doesn't even know that it is playing Go. So, **[we don't have to fear

But we do have to worry about the impact even stupid AI is starting to

1\. We believe [the most important division in today's left is between
those that hold to a folk politics of localism]{.underline}, direct
action, and relentless horizontalism, [and those that outline what must
become called an accelerationist politics at ease with a modernity of
abstraction, complexity, globality, and technology. The former remains
content with establishing small and temporary spaces of non-capitalist
social relations, eschewing the real problems entailed in facing foes
which are intrinsically non-local]{.underline}, abstract, and rooted
deep in our everyday infrastructure. The failure of such politics has
been built-in from the very beginning. By contrast, [an accelerationist
politics seeks to preserve the gains of late capitalism while going
further than its value system, governance structures, and mass
pathologies will allow.]{.underline} 2. All of us want to work less. It
is an intriguing question as to why it was that the world's leading
economist of the post-war era believed that an enlightened capitalism
inevitably progressed towards a radical reduction of working hours. In
The Economic Prospects for Our Grandchildren (written in 1930), Keynes
forecast a capitalist future where individuals would have their work
reduced to three hours a day. What has instead occurred is the
progressive elimination of the work-life distinction, with work coming
to permeate every aspect of the emerging social factory. 3. [Capitalism
has begun to constrain the productive forces of technology, or at least,
direct them towards needlessly narrow ends. Patent wars and idea
monopolisation are contemporary phenomena that point to both capital's
need to move beyond competition, and capital's increasingly retrograde
approach to technology.]{.underline} The properly accelerative gains of
neoliberalism have not led to less work or less stress. And rather than
a world of space travel, future shock, and revolutionary technological
potential, we exist in a time where the only thing which develops is
marginally better consumer gadgetry. Relentless iterations of the same
basic product sustain marginal consumer demand at the expense of human
acceleration. 4. We do not want to return to Fordism. There can be no
return to Fordism. The capitalist "golden era" was premised on the
production paradigm of the orderly factory environment, where (male)
workers received security and a basic standard of living in return for a
lifetime of stultifying boredom and social repression. Such a system
relied upon an international hierarchy of colonies, empires, and an
underdeveloped periphery; a national hierarchy of racism and sexism; and
a rigid family hierarchy of female subjugation. For all the nostalgia
many may feel, this regime is both undesirable and practically
impossible to return to. 5. Accelerationists want to unleash latent
productive forces. In this project, [the material platform of
neoliberalism does not need to be destroyed. It needs to be repurposed
towards common ends. The existing infrastructure is not a capitalist
stage to be smashed, but a springboard to launch towards
post-capitalism.]{.underline} 6. Given the enslavement of technoscience
to capitalist objectives (especially since the late 1970s)
[we]{.underline} surely [do not yet know what a modern technosocial body
can do.]{.underline} Who amongst us fully recognizes what untapped
potentials await in the technology which has already been developed? Our
wager is that the [true transformative potentials of much of our
technological and scientific research remain unexploited,]{.underline}
filled with presently redundant features (or pre-adaptations) that,
following a shift beyond the short-sighted capitalist socius, can become
decisive. 7. [We want to accelerate the process of technological
evolution. But what we are arguing for is not techno-utopianism. Never
believe that technology will be sufficient to save us. Necessary, yes,
but never sufficient without socio-political action. Technology and the
social are intimately bound up with one another, and changes in either
potentiate and reinforce changes in the other]{.underline}. Whereas the
techno-utopians argue for acceleration on the basis that it will
automatically overcome social conflict, our position is that technology
should be accelerated precisely because it is needed in order to win
social conflicts. 8. We believe that [any post-capitalism will require
post-capitalist planning. The faith placed in the idea that, after a
revolution, the people will spontaneously constitute a novel
socioeconomic system that isn't simply a return to capitalism is naïve
at best, and ignorant at worst. To further this, we must develop both a
cognitive map of the existing system and a speculative image of the
future economic system.]{.underline} 9. [To do so, the left must take
advantage of every technological and scientific advance made possible by
capitalist society]{.underline}. We declare that [quantification is not
an evil to be eliminated, but a tool to be used in the most effective
manner possible. Economic modelling is --- simply put --- a necessity
for making intelligible a complex world]{.underline}. The 2008 financial
crisis reveals the risks of blindly accepting mathematical models on
faith, yet this is a problem of illegitimate authority not of
mathematics itself. [The tools to be found in social network analysis,
agent-based modelling, big data analytics, and non-equilibrium economic
models, are necessary cognitive mediators for understanding complex
systems like the modern economy. The accelerationist left must become
literate in these technical fields.]{.underline} 10. Any transformation
of society must involve economic and social experimentation. The Chilean
Project Cybersyn is emblematic of this experimental attitude --- fusing
advanced cybernetic technologies, with sophisticated economic modelling,
and a democratic platform instantiated in the technological
infrastructure itself. Similar experiments were conducted in
1950s--1960s Soviet economics as well, employing cybernetics and linear
programming in an attempt to overcome the new problems faced by the
first communist economy. That both of these were ultimately unsuccessful
can be traced to the political and technological constraints these early
cyberneticians operated under. 11. [The left must develop sociotechnical
hegemony: both in the sphere of ideas, and in the sphere of material
platforms.]{.underline} Platforms are the infrastructure of global
society. They establish the basic parameters of what is possible, both
behaviourally and ideologically. In this sense, they embody the material
transcendental of society: they are what make possible particular sets
of actions, relationships, and powers. [While much of the current global
platform is biased towards capitalist social relations, this is not an
inevitable necessity. These material platforms of production, finance,
logistics, and consumption can and will be reprogrammed and reformatted
towards post-capitalist ends.]{.underline}

03-21-12. "Gender and Valuing Nuclear Weapons Working Paper for
'Devaluing Nuclear Weapons: Concepts and Challenges'."
http://www.academia.edu/download/36264886/Gender_and_Valuing_Nuclear_Weapons_paper_draft_1.docx

This brings me to gender as symbolic system and the notion that
masculine value is attributed to states and their nuclear weaponry via
the conceptual pairings, metaphors and imagery circulating in discourses
of global politics and everyday life. This view is crucial to the
'discursive' framework on masculinity and nuclear weapons, with its
emphasis on the abstracted, steely euphemisms of technostrategic
reasoning, and, in Cohn's formulation at least, their simultaneous
intertwining with powerful masculine metaphors of patriarchal power,
family life, and male sexual and reproductive potency. **[Cohn's
arguments]{.underline}** are extended in the security-sovereignty
critique of feminist IR, which **[indicate]{.underline}**s **[that
dominant understandings of security and the state are infused
with]{.underline}** similar language and **[gendered
connotations]{.underline}**. So we learn from this way of thinking about
gender and value that it is not just nuclear weapons but also the states
and state elites that possess them, the relationships within which they
are embedded and the goals they are intended to achieve that are
reproduced as masculine and thereby accorded status through particular
discursive techniques and characteristics. I want to finish by
suggesting that this third conception of gender as a symbolic system
also points to the possibility that the converse discursive relationship
exists -- that **[nuclear security is one of the key symbolic
matrices]{.underline}** **[through which gender categories are
constructed and accorded value. Rather than treating masculinity as
prior to and underpinning]{.underline}** **[the value accorded to
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, then, on this view **[we should start
with nuclear weapons]{.underline}** **[and see how they may be shaping
the content and parameters of new forms of masculine identity and
domination. This approach]{.underline}** is not one that has been
adopted in the literature I have explored here; rather I am suggesting a
possible future direction for feminist analysis of nuclear weapons, one
that **[would enable us to take on board more fully the shifts in
theorising]{.underline}** **[that have occurred in recent
years]{.underline}** as described above. **[A more plural and
performative]{.underline}** **[notion of gendered identity, a more
intersectional]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[productive/discursive]{.underline}** **[understanding of gendered
power, and a more context-specific, historicised]{.underline}**
**[understanding of the way in which gendered dichotomies play out in
systems of meaning could all be part of a study that refuses to take
gender as prior]{.underline}** **[to nuclear weapons but instead
investigates how its contours and parameters are (re)constructed in
specific nuclear contexts.]{.underline}** 5. Gender and devaluing
nuclear weapons I want to close with some very brief suggestions of the
implications of all this for devaluing nuclear weapons. At least three
avenues are suggested by each of the ways of thinking about gender and
value outlined here. **[If we take seriously the notion that gendered
identities give rise to different value systems]{.underline}**, and that
it is specifically masculine identities and value systems in which
nuclear weapons gain their status, **[we might want to prioritise
breaking open male-dominated state elites]{.underline}** in order to get
more women into positions of power. **[Yet although]{.underline}** I
think **[this would be desirable as a matter of justice, I am troubled
by the obvious implication]{.underline}** **[that an all-woman elite
would be the final solution to the problem of nuclear weapons... This is
a strategy of reversal rather than of undoing, and one, moreover, that
makes the assumption gender identities are fixed and universal, rather
than performative and multiple. So we might seek instead or in addition
to challenge the very particular modes of masculinity]{.underline}**
**[that are upheld by those in power, to insist on the value of multiple
masculine and feminine identities]{.underline}**, **[to refuse the
notion that masculine/feminine modes of being are incommensurable, to
develop strategies that detach interrelational ethics of care from
female selves and insist on their wider purchase. Turning to the
argument that gender is an axis of power and domination, we are
presented with the imperative to devalue]{.underline}** actors and
**[objects]{.underline}** **[associated with the masculine and either to
elevate those associated with the feminine or to strive for a more
androgynous future]{.underline}** in which the masculine and feminine
are valued equally, or not at all. **[And, finally, the notion that
gender is a symbolic system implies the need to expose the discursive
techniques through which nuclear weapons are freighted with masculine
associations, to search for internal contradictions]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[instabilities of meaning]{.underline}**, and to
develop new symbolic systems that reshape our interpretation of nuclear
weapons. I would stress that none of these suggestions is original---all
have previously been put forward in feminist theory and activism, and in
much more detail. I would like to see that theory and activism receiving
renewed attention in feminist IR circles and more generally. And I would
also like to see the implications explored of the proposition that
nuclear weapons are a crucial factor in the contemporary reconfiguration
of gender. If that proposition is correct, then perhaps the challenge is
not only to reshape, subordinate or displace masculinity in order to
devalue nuclear weapons, but also to think through how
**[relinquishing]{.underline}** **[nuclear weapons could open up new
horizons for gendered identity, power and discourse]{.underline}**. The
example with which I began the paper seems particularly pertinent on
this point. Perhaps we should be asking not only how we can reframe
gender to support a Scotland free of nuclear weapons, but also in what
ways that prospect could inaugurate shifts in gendered identity, power
and discourse in a Scottish state -- and, perhaps even more importantly,
in an English state that, in Macwhirter's terms, clings still to its
masculine symbols of virility.

### Militarism \-\-- Bleiker

**Permutation do the AFF and challenge the national security
paradigm\-\--[methodologically pluralist]{.underline} understandings are

International Relations, University of Queensland, "International Theory
Between Reification and Self-Reflective Critique," International Studies
Review, 16(2), 6-17-2014, p.325-327

This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have
embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement. For
Levine, **[the key challenge in]{.underline}** international relations
(**[IR]{.underline}**) **[scholarship is]{.underline}** what he calls
**["unchecked reification": the widespread and dangerous process of
forgetting "the distinction between theoretical concepts and the
real-world things they mean to describe]{.underline}** or to which they
refer" (p. 15). **[The dangers are real]{.underline}**, Levine stresses,
**[because IR deals with some of the most difficult issues, from
genocides to war]{.underline}**. **[Upholding one subjective position
without critical scrutiny can]{.underline}** thus **[have far-reaching
consequences]{.underline}**. Following Theodor Adorno---who is the key
theoretical influence on this book---Levine takes a post-positive
position and assumes that the world cannot be known outside of our human
perceptions and the values that are inevitably intertwined with them.
His ultimate goal is to overcome reification, or, to be more precise, to
recognize it as an inevitable aspect of thought so that its dangerous
consequences can be mitigated. **[Levine]{.underline}** proceeds in
three stages: First he reviews several decades of IR theories to
resurrect critical moments when scholars displayed an acute awareness of
the dangers of reification. He refreshingly breaks down distinctions
between conventional and progressive scholarship, for he **[detects
self-reflective and critical moments in]{.underline}** scholars that are
usually associated with **[straightforward positivist
positions]{.underline}** (such as E.H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, or Graham
Allison). But Levine also shows how these moments of self-reflexivity
never lasted long and were driven out by the compulsion to offer
systematic and scientific knowledge. The second stage of Levine\'s
inquiry **[outlines why]{.underline}** IR scholars regularly closed down
critique. Here, he points to a range of factors and phenomena, from peer
review processes to the speed at which academics are meant to publish.
And here too, he eschews conventional wisdom, showing that work
conducted in the wake of the third debate, **[while explicitly
post-positivist]{.underline}** and critiquing the reifying tendencies of
existing **[IR scholarship, often lacked critical
self-awareness]{.underline}**. As a result, Levine believes that many of
the **[respective authors failed to appreciate sufficiently that
"reification is a consequence of all thinking---including
itself"]{.underline}** (p. 68). The third objective of Levine\'s book is
also the most interesting one. Here, he outlines the path toward what he
calls "**[sustainable critique]{.underline}**": a form of
self-reflection that can counter the dangers of reification. Critique,
for him, **[is not just something that is directed outwards, against
particular theories or theorists]{.underline}**. **[It is also
inward-oriented, ongoing, and sensitive to the "limitations of thought
itself"]{.underline}** (p. 12). The challenges that such a sustainable
critique faces are formidable. Two stand out: First, if the natural
tendency to forget the origins and values of our concepts are as strong
as Levine and other Adorno-inspired theorists believe they are, then how
can we actually recognize our own reifying tendencies? Are we not all
inevitably and subconsciously caught in a web of meanings from which we
cannot escape? Second, if one constantly questions one\'s own
perspective, does one not fall into a relativism that loses the ability
to establish the kind of stable foundations that are necessary for
political action? Adorno has, of course, been critiqued as relentlessly
negative, even by his second-generation Frankfurt School successors
(from Jürgen Habermas to his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater
and Ken Booth). The response that Levine has to these two sets of
legitimate criticisms are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a
practical level. **[He starts off with depicting reification not as a
flaw that is meant to be expunged, but as an a priori condition for
scholarship]{.underline}**. The challenge then is not to let it go
unchecked. **[Methodological pluralism lies at the heart
of]{.underline}** Levine\'s **[sustainable critique]{.underline}**. He
borrows from what Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to
**[juxtapose, rather than integrate]{.underline}**, different
perspectives. It is in this spirit that Levine advocates **[multiple
methods to understand the same event]{.underline}**
