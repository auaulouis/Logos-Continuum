## Thesis

**Asian representations are used as a counterpart to the West - Asia
becomes the Other**

**Zhang 14**

Charlie Yi Zhang, Charlie Yi Zhang is an assistant professor in global
studies at South Dakota State University. Using feminism, critical race
theory, queer theory, and political economy as primary frameworks, his
research focuses on how global neoliberal restructuring is proceeding
and perpetuated through the categories of race, gender, class, and
sexuality. Building on these categories as critical heuristics, he is
also interested in how marginalized groups are creating alternative
dimensions of living and survival outside the dominant neoliberal
economy. He can be reached at charlie.zhang@sdstate.edu. "Untangling the

First, I untangle the convoluted etymological triad of Asia, Asian, and
Asia-Pacific and dismantle their colonialist, racist, sexist, and/or
neoliberal investment. Building on different scholars' deconstructive
readings of these terms, such as Edward W. Said's (1978) and Aihwa Ong's
(1999, 2003, 2006, 2010), I will interrogate their embedded meanings
that have been translated into new discourses and practices to sustain
neoliberal economies in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Second, I will demonstrate
how populations in the Asia-Pacific are disassembled and then
reassembled to facilitate global division and migration of labor through
the intersectional biopolitics of race, gender, and class. As shall be
elucidated, along the intersectional contours of these biopolitical
governing parameters new controlling images are (re)created to
legitimize this process. Third, I will show how gender and class
inequalities are used intersectionally by the Chinese state to
facilitate China's transition from socialism to neoliberalism and its
reintegration with the global economy. Using China as a central site of
inquiry, I will explicate how intersectional biopolitics is fundamental
to neoliberal globalization. Finally, I will use Liu Xiang, the
state-sponsored, hyper-masculine icon as an example to show how gender
is co-opted by the party-state to construct a racialized discourse of an
Asian model to validate its alternative neoliberal practices, and to
challenge US neoliberal practices. This strategy, however, has
reinforced neoliberal control by endorsing its racializing biopolitical
script. This article therefore seeks to dislodge the intricacy,
ambiguity, and contingency of neoliberal practices and ideologies that
are anchored in the shifting contours of identities. As shall be
demonstrated, only a multi-axis, analytically diverse and flexible, and
culturally and materially integrative framework can capture the
essential feature of intersectional biopolitics as the underlying
mechanism that fuels neoliberal globalization and leads us to newly
imagined possibilities for changes. In the following section, I will
start by deconstructing the varying meanings of Asia, Asian, and
AsiaPacific in different socio-historical backgrounds in order to better
understand how they have contributed to the current neoliberal
conditions. Untangling Asia, Asian, and the Asia-Pacific [In Clinton's
Foreign Policy article, the terms Asia, Asian, and Asia-Pacific are used
interchangeably to justify the US statist machinery that is ready to
trump over the Asia-Pacific Rim.]{.underline} [Despite a common
etymological root, these terms are constructed in disparate
socio-historical contexts and laden with different values and even
contradictory meanings that need to be qualified.]{.underline} As Michel
[Foucault (1972) reminds us, cartography is never neutral, but inflected
by power]{.underline}. Asia is no exception. As a geographic construct,
the concept of Asia was constituted out of complex, dynamic histories
and processes (Wilson 2006). As Said suggests in his groundbreaking
Orientalism (1978), **[[the monolithic notion of Asia was]{.mark} first
[created as a barbaric Other to shore up the]{.mark}]{.underline}** 172
· Feminist Formations 26.3 **[[modern boundary of Europe and a unified
trajectory of]{.mark} human [societies]{.mark}. [It was embedded in the
Eurocentric imaginary to classify and]{.mark} unify [world civilizations
to the telos of modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries**, [when "the European Enlightenment and colonial
expansion provided conditions for the development of a new system of
knowledge]{.mark}. . . . [The notions of Europe and Asia were]{.mark}
both [products of this]{.mark} process of knowledge
[construction"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wang 2007, 4). [Not only a
geographic category but also a form of civilization**, [Asia is
constructed to represent an]{.mark} anachronistic [Other to]{.mark}
European capitalism and [the modern nation-state]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In other words, **[it was produced to uphold the Eurocentric unilinear
narrative of human societies]{.underline}**. As Kwai-Cheung Lo (2010, 7)
observes, **["[the]{.mark} traditional [notion]{.mark} of Asia [is a
Eurocentric fabrication that distinguishes the advanced West]{.mark}ern
subject [from]{.mark} despotic, [backward]{.mark}, and [non-Christian
civilizations]{.mark}, [and that channels Western anxieties
about]{.mark} insecurity and [loss of hegemony]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
On this account, **[[the construct of Asia as a unified entity
is]{.mark} steeply [inflected with colonialist
meanings]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In the twentieth century, variant
versions of pan-Asianism originated from Asian countries' responses to
the European imperialist expansion;]{.underline} to name but a few, [the
Japanese pan-Asianism that Asia should unite against European invaders,
and Indonesian pan--Southeast Asianism against Dutch colonialism.
Initiated as counter-imperialist endeavors, some of these constructions
of pan-Asianism were also penetrated by imperialism and
colonialism.]{.underline} As Ara Wilson (2006) notes, [during World War
II, the homogenizing notion of Asia was invoked by the Japanese to
propel their colonialist and militant juggernaut and legitimate their
invasion of other countries in the area, as indicated by the deceptive
and coercive discourse of its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity
Sphere."]{.underline} In this regard, the **[European colonialist
conception of Asia lays the discursive foundation of pan-Asianism, later
invoked by Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia to legitimize
their alternative neoliberal practices to the Western, especially the US
paradigm.]{.underline}** Although sharing the same etymological origin,
[in Western societies the term Asian is not just an adjective
designating a geographic region, but also a racial category that can be
traced back to the US socio-economic upheavals during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries]{.underline}. As defined by
Howard Winant (2004, 155), race is "a concept that signifies and
symbolizes socio-political conflicts and interests in reference to
different types of human bodies." As he sees it, racial classification
based on phenotypical and genotypical differences is a social product of
modernity in around the sixteenth century by and for the burgeoning
capitalist economy in North America. Also, racism is an artifact to
consolidate the racial hierarchy in the service of US slavery and
capitalism, which first took the form of black/white dichotomy. Building
on Winant, Sally Kitch (2009) further contends that there is a gendered
foundation of racial formation in US history. As a relatively newer
racial category in the United States, Asian is also founded on gender
ideology. In the late nineteenth century, Chinese and Charlie Yi Zhang ·
173 Japanese immigrants, as two of the earliest immigrant groups from
Asia, were considered two different ethnic groups rather than one race.
As Catherine Lee (2010) argues, [gender played a fundamental role in the
formation of Asian as a homogenizing racial identity for Chinese and
Japanese.]{.underline} As she shows, attracted by the increasing demand
of the construction and mining industries [**in the midnineteenth
century, thousands of Chinese males came to the United States as
laborers.**]{.underline} Compared with the large number of males,
[**very few Chinese women came to the United States**]{.underline}
during this time. To satisfy the sexual and affective needs of the male
workers, **[some of these women took the role of partial "wife" for
multiple men.]{.underline}** Although this alternative familial paradigm
served the interests of industrial capital by reducing the cost of labor
reproduction, [**Chinese women were nevertheless naturalized as
inherently "promiscuous" and "slutty"---an Orientalist imagination that
fueled the denigrating conception of the entire Chinese immigrant
group.** When recession hit the US economy during the]{.underline}
so-called [long depression (]{.underline}1873--96), [the gendered and
sexualized conception of Chinese immigrants was translated into
discourse of the "yellow peril" that legitimized the 1882 Chinese
Exclusion Act.]{.underline} In contrast, as a newer immigrant group, the
Japanese came to work in the agricultural economy that began to thrive
in the West at the end of the nineteenth century. As farm work is
usually family-based, Japanese immigrants were more sexually balanced
compared with the Chinese, and Japanese women were thus considered
familyoriented, differentiating them from the "prurient" Chinese women.
However, the newly claimed West territory soon gave rise to the crisis
of a unified identity of Americanness (Van Nuys 2002), and [Japanese
women's alleged high fertility (although not statistically verified) was
considered a threat to the racial purity of the (white) American
nation-state]{.underline}. [The gendered and sexualized conception of
the Japanese soon relegated them to an inferior position in the racial
hierarchy, with the Chinese]{.underline}. In this sense, as Lee (2010)
contends[, gender was the key that first helped to ethnically
differentiate the two groups, and then it racially conflated them as one
racial group---Asian.]{.underline} Racial ideology reshapes the gender
identity of Asian Americans as well. In the popular imagination, [Asian
men are usually depicted as "intelligent," while Asian women are viewed
as docile, submissive, and fragile]{.underline}. Attempts were made to
verify these perceptions with "scientific methods" (Rushton 1997). [For
Asians, whose intelligence was presumed to be greater than that of
whites, the only reasonable solution was to keep them out
entirely]{.underline} (Reddy 2003, 23[). Racial ideology depicts Asian
men as less "sexual" and softer and weaker in physical strength, placing
them in a disadvantaged position as they deviated from the norm of Anglo
American masculinity]{.underline} (Yu 2001). In contrast to the
constructed image of the "over-heterosexualized Black men," Asian men
are considered not heterosexual enough, thus posing a threat to
heteronormative white masculinity (Collins 2004). The social consequence
of the intersectional mechanism of gender and race for Asian American
men is termed racial castration by David 174 · Feminist Formations 26.3
L. Eng (2001). As we can see[**, [the intersection of race]{.mark} and
gender [grounds the socio-cultural basis of Asian identity in the United
States]{.mark}, which later [spread to]{.mark} other parts of the world,
such as [the Asia-Pacific Rim, through the expansion of US]{.mark}
hegemony and [politico-economic influence]{.mark}**. In the United
States since the late 1970s, the meanings of Asian have varied with
shifting socio-economic conditions]{.underline}. Since immigration
reform in the 1960s, Asians and Latinos have become the major immigrant
groups (Plaut 2010). [In contrast to the poor/working-class immigrants
during the nineteenth century, many well-educated, middle-to-upper-class
technological professionals, entrepreneurs, and students from Asia have
been attracted by US policies designed to boost the knowledge
economy---a position that the United States assigns to itself in the
global industrial hierarchy.]{.underline} **[The economic successes of
these segments of new Asian immigrants are then over-generalized as the
"model minority" myth]{.underline}**---[a success story of new
immigrants through assimilation into American life and
values]{.underline} (Maeda 2005). As will be shown below, this
racialized (and gendered) image has been fueling the perpetuation of
neoliberal global control. [The Asia-Pacific Rim was constructed in the
service of US-led neoliberal globalization]{.underline} in the late
1970s. As Ong (2006) points out, this extra-sovereign territorial
construct was constituted through the disassembling and then
reassembling of state territories in order to create a latitudinal space
for the crossPacific movement of capital and labor that spans from the
West Coast of the United States to East and Southeast Asia. The
offshoring and outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to Asian countries
within this area effectively lowers the labor costs and increases profit
margins of US corporations. Also, because of these market needs,
laborers migrate to this territory for opportunities of economic
survival and/or prosperity. Clinton's presumptuous pronouncement of the
"Pacific century," for instance, can be interpreted as a rhetorical
attempt to reassert US dominance in the area. Ong's discussion of the
Asia-Pacific Rim is based on the Foucauldian concept of neoliberal
governmentality, which views neoliberalism as a set of coherent
governing practices. The following section, centering on neoliberalism
as governmentality, will illustrate how the hierarchization of labor
across the area is enacted and justified by the intersection of race,
gender, class, and citizenship. Neoliberalism as Governmentality
Although neoliberalism has become the single script of globalization
(Hardt 2011), it is never without challenge. As Saskia Sassen (2007)
notes, earlier feminist scholarship has documented various effects on
women by, as well as their resistance to, it. Recently, such scholarship
has moved beyond the paradigm that views neoliberal globalization as a
homogenizing process and women as its universal victims, and produced
nuanced analyses of its contingent effects on Charlie Yi Zhang · 175
different groups of women.5 The Foucauldian (2008) concept of
neoliberalism as contingent and variable governing practices is of
particular use to challenge the reductive understanding of neoliberalism
and corporate globalization. Harvey's (2003) theorizing of "accumulation
by dispossession" also proves instrumental to understanding how cultural
identities can be invoked to create new operative space for
over-accumulated capital.6 Moreover, feminist of color framings of
intersectionality help tease out the overlapping relationships among
various identity categories to deepen our knowledge of the central role
of intersectional biopolitics in neoliberal globalization.7 One
underpinning of neoliberal globalization is the reproduction of human
beings as differential labor to engineer and accelerate transnational
market competition. As Foucault (2008) contends, neoliberalism is a type
of governmentality, or an art of governance with a self-coherent agenda
to organize, regulate, and manage societies. As he sees it,
governmentality is the reasoned way of governing best, the calculation
of governing practices to maximize economic and political profits for
societies. Foucault (2011, 4) further clarifies governmentality as "the
techniques and procedures by which one sets about conducting the conduct
of others," or "an action upon an action, on existing actions or on
those which may arise in the present or the future" (1982, 789). In
other words, to govern is "to structure the possible field of action of
others" (790). In this regard, the administration of bodies and the
calculated management of life become the core of governmentality in what
he calls "biopolitics" (2008). Scientific, medical, legal, and cultural
discourses, as well as institutionalized systems, were created to study,
differentiate, stratify, hierarchize, and engineer human beings as a
"population" in order to better govern society. In The History of
Sexuality, Foucault (\[1976\] 1990) demonstrates how the development of
the burgeoning capitalistic economy in Europe during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries was made possible through the regulation and
adjustment of bodies and the population by controlling and normalizing
the spectrums of sexual possibilities. As he illustrates, all
sexualities (particularly homosexuality) except for those between
heterosexual couples were delegitimized so as to normalize
heterosexuality as the only acceptable social norm in order to guarantee
the reproduction and sustained supply of capable subjects for the
capitalist economy and market competition. As a particular type of
governmentality, the raison d'être of neoliberalism is the creation and
maintenance of market competition to maximize the benefits of the entire
society and the pivot is the production of enterprising subjects (Homo
economicus) for this relationship (Foucault 2008). Foucault's conception
of neoliberalism is particularly useful for the case of China because,
as Li Zhang and Ong (2008) note, without a political overhaul (like the
former Soviet Union), the creation of a new type of market subjectivity
is key to China's socio-economic transformation. Although Foucault draws
our attention back to real people with the concept of neoliberal
governmentality and his highlighting of biopolitics as 176 · Feminist
Formations 26.3 its primary mechanism, except for sexuality, he leaves a
theoretical lacuna by under-discussing humankind as also gendered,
racialized, and classed subjects (Stoler 1995). As Margaret Somers
(2008) argues, the essence of the market is that unequal subjects
transact equal exchange values in the market. Such embodied attributes
as gender, race, and class are the important biopolitical parameters for
the creation of diversified market subjects (Giroux 2008). From a
different perspective, David Harvey (1982) brings cultural identities
into the discussion of neoliberal globalization. As he sees it, the root
of neoliberal globalization is the over-accumulation of capital---the
saturated market and shrinking demand vis-à-vis over-produced
commodities---which left little space for capital reproduction in the
industrialized countries in the late 1970s. Besides over-consumption
(see Baudrillard \[1970\] 1998; Jameson 1990), another outlet to
over-accumulated capital is what Harvey (2003, 149) calls "accumulation
by dispossession": "to release a set of assets (including labor power)
at very low (and in some instances zero) cost," particularly in
non-Western countries. Over-accumulated capital can seize hold of such
assets and turn them into profitable use. Although accumulation by
dispossession takes place in various and contingent forms, such
extra-market systems/cultures as "kinship structures, familial and
household arrangements, gender and authority relations" definitely play
an important role (146).

**Western discourses construct the Orient to act as the Other to affirm
Western superiority**

**Bertens 12**

Hans Bertens, November 12, 2012, Hans Bertens is based at the University
of Utrecht, the Netherlands. He is the author of The Idea of the
Postmodern (Routledge, 1995). "Literary Theory The Basics" Section:
Orientalism, //jazmyn

With all due respect for the pioneering work done by Commonwealth
literary studies and by postcolonial writers such as Edward Brathwaite,
Wilson Harris, Chinua Achebe, and Wole Soyinka, postcolonial studies in
its current theoretically oriented form starts with the publication, in
1978, of the Palestinian--American critic Edward Said's book
Orientalism. Drawing on Foucault and, to a lesser extent, Gramsci,
Said's study completely changed the agenda of the study of nonWestern
cultures and their literatures and pushed it in the direction of what we
now call postcolonial theory. **[Orientalism is a devastating critique
of how through the ages, but particularly in the nineteenth century --
the heyday of imperialist expansion --]{.underline}** which is the
book's focus, **[Western texts have represented the East, and more
specifically the Islamic Middle East]{.underline}** (for the sake of
convenience I will simply refer to
'theOrient'or'theEast'here).[UsingBritishandFrench]{.underline}'scholarly
works ... [works of literature, political tracts, journalistic texts,
travel books, religious and philological studies']{.underline} (Said
1991: 23), Said examines how **[these [texts construct the Orient
through imaginative representations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in for
instance novels), **[through seemingly factual descriptions (in
journalistic reports and travel writing), and [through claims to
knowledge about Oriental history and culture]{.mark} (histories,
anthropological writings,]{.underline}** and so on). Together, all these
forms of Western writing form a Foucauldian discourse-- a loose system
of statements and claims that constitutes a field of supposed knowledge
and through which that 'knowledge' is constructed. Such discourses,
although seemingly interested in knowledge, always establish
relationships of power. In Foucault's work, power is first of all a
force that serves itself. We may think we use it for our own purposes in
our capacity as free agents, but in reality it works first of all
through us and not for us. From Foucault's POSTCOLONIAL CRITICISM AND
THEORY 203 anti-humanistic perspective we are functions within networks
of power. For Said, however, **[[the West's representations of the
East]{.mark} ultimately [work within the framework of a
conscious]{.mark} and determined [effort at
subordination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Said, **[Orientalism -- [this
Western discourse about the Orient -- has traditionally served
hegemonicpurposes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As we have seen, Antonio
Gramsci thought of 'hegemony' as domination by consent -- the way the
ruling class succeeds in oppressing other classes with their apparent
approval. In Gramsci's analysis it does so through culture: the ruling
class makes its own values and interests central in what it presents as
a common, neutral, culture. Accepting that 'common' culture, the other
classes become complicit in their own oppression and the result is a
kind of velvet domination. [Orientalism, then, has traditionally served
two purposes. [It has legitimized Western]{.mark} expansionism and
[imperialism]{.mark} in the eyes of Western governments and their
electorates and it has insidiously worked to convince the 'natives' that
Western culture represented universal civilization. Accepting that
culture could only benefit them]{.underline} -- it would, for instance,
[elevate them from the 'backward' or 'superstitious' conditions in which
they still lived -- and would make them participants in the most
advanced civilization the world had ever seen.]{.underline} For Said,
**[[Western representations of the Orient]{.mark}, no matter how well
intentioned, [have always been]{.mark} part of this [damaging]{.mark}
discourse]{.underline}**. Wittingly or unwittingly, they have always
been complicit with the workings of Western power. [Even those
Orientalists who are clearly in sympathy with Oriental peoples and their
cultures -- and Said finds a substantial number of them -- cannot
overcome their Eurocentric perspective and have unintentionally
contributed to Western domination]{.underline}. So **[instead of the
disinterested objectivity in the service of the higher goal of true
knowledge that Western scholarship has traditionally claimed for itself,
[we find]{.mark} invariably [false representations that have]{.mark}
effectively [paved the way for military domination,]{.mark} cultural
[displacement, and]{.mark} economic
[exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I should perhaps say at this point
that in later publications, and in response to criticism, Said has
modified his position and presented a less homogeneous picture of
Orientalism, while he has also down LITERARY THEORY: THE BASICS 204
played the extent to which it merely constructs and never describes.
There is no doubt, however, that Orientalism, whatever its shortcomings
may have been, revolutionized the way Western scholars and critics
looked at representations of nonWestern subjects and cultures (just like
feminism had somewhat earlier revolutionized the way we look at
representations of women and African--American studies had
revolutionized the way in which in particular American criticism looks
at representations of African--Americans). Said's book also drew
attention to the way in which [[the discourse of Orientalism serves to
create the West as well it creates the East]{.mark}.]{.underline}
**[[West and East form a binary opposition in which the two poles define
each other]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Chapter 5). **[[The inferiority
that Orientalism attributes to the East simultaneously serves to
construct the West's superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The
sensuality, irrationality, primitiveness, and despotism of the East
constructs the West as rational, democratic, progressive, and so
on.]{.underline} **[[The West always functions as the 'centre' and the
East is a marginal 'other' that simply through its existence confirms
the West's]{.mark} centrality and [superiority]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Not surprisingly perhaps, the opposition that the West's discourse about
the East sets up makes use of another basic opposition, that between the
masculine and the feminine. Naturally [the West functions as the
masculine pole -- enlightened, rational, entrepreneurial, disciplined --
while the East is its feminine opposition -- irrational, passive,
undisciplined, and sensual.]{.underline} [Race, ethnicity, and the
dominant position of the metropolis were already well established on the
literary-critical agenda when Orientalismappeared, as was the study of
Commonwealth writing in English and the study of English literature
dealing with colonial relations]{.underline} (E.M. Forster's A Passage
to India(1924), for instance). Said, however, was the first to draw on
the new French theory and on the recently discovered Gramsci (parts of
whose work had been published in English in 1971 -- see Chapter 4) in
dealing with these issues. [Orientalism offered a challenging
theoretical framework and a new perspective on the interpretation of
Western writing about the East (and other non-Western cultures) and of
writing produced under colonial rule -- which might be read both for
signs of complicity with Western]{.underline} POSTCOLONIAL CRITICISM AND
THEORY 205 [hegemony and for a possibly counterhegemonic
stance]{.underline}. (Just like Gramsci, Said makes room for
intentionally counterhegemonic moves.) Orientalism put the role of the
West's cultural institutions (the university, literary writing,
newspapers, and so on) in its military, economic, and cultural
domination of non-Western nations and peoples firmly on the agenda and
asked questions that we still ask concerning literature's role in past
and present racial, ethnic, and cultural encounters. As a matter of
fact, our questions have since 1978 only proliferated. Can we really see
all Western writings about Said's East, and, by implication, the
non-West in general, as more or less indistinguishable from each other
as far as their representations of the non-Western world are concerned?
Mary-Louise Pratt's Imperial Eyes from 1992, for instance, argues that
travel writing by women about the nonWest is rather different from
travel writing by men. Said himself would be the first to admit that
such differences are real enough and postcolonial criticism is still
busy mapping them.

### GENERAL THESIS

#### Orientalism is the structure of thought grounded within the political dominance of the Middle East and Asia by the West

**Singh 04**

(Amardeep Singh, Associate Professor of English at Lehigh University,
9-24-2004, \"Amardeep Singh: An Introduction to Edward Said,
Orientalism, and Postcolonial Literary Studies,\"
<https://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/09/introduction-to-edward-said.html,DMW)>

Said directly challenged what Euro-American scholars traditionally
referred to as \"Orientalism.\" [Orientalism is an entrenched structure
of thought, a pattern of making certain generalizations about the part
of the world known as the \'Eas]{.underline}t\'. As Said puts it:
"[Orientalism was ultimately a political vision of reality whose
structure promoted the difference between the familiar]{.underline}
(Europe, [West, \"us\") and the strange (the Orient, the East,
\"them\")."]{.underline} Just to be clear, Said didn\'t invent the term
\'Orientalism\'; it was a term used especially by middle east
specialists, Arabists, as well as many who studied both East Asia and
the Indian subcontinent. The vastness alone of the part of the world
that European and American scholars thought of as the \"East\" should,
one imagines, have caused some one to think twice. But for the most
part, that self-criticism didn't happen, and Said argues that the
failure there --- the blind spot of orientalist thinking --- is a
structural one. [The stereotypes assigned to Oriental cultures and
\"Orientals\" as individuals are pretty specific]{.underline}:
[Orientals are despotic and clannish. They are despotic when placed in
positions of power, and sly and obsequious when in subservient
positions.]{.underline} Orientals, so the stereotype goes[, are
impossible to trust.]{.underline} They are [capable of sophisticated
abstractions, but not of concrete, practical organization or rigorous,
detail-oriented analysis]{.underline}. Their [men are sexually
incontinent, while their women are locked up behind bars. Orientals
are,]{.underline} by definition, [strange]{.underline}. The best summary
of the Orientalist mindset would probably be: "East is east and west is
west, and never the twain shall meet" (Rudyard Kipling). In his book,
[Said asks: but where is this sly, devious, despotic, mystical Oriental?
Has anyone ever met anyone who meets this description in all
particulars?]{.underline} In fact, this idea of [the Oriental is a
particular kind of myth produced by European thought, especially in and
after the 18th century.]{.underline} In some sense his book Orientalism
aims to dismantle this myth, but more than that Said\'s goal is to
identify Orientalism as a discourse. From Myth to Discourse. [The
oriental is a myth or a stereotype, but Said shows that the myth had,
over the course of two centuries of European thought, come to be thought
of as a kind of systematic knowledge about the Eas]{.underline}t.
Because [the myth masqueraded as fact, the results of studies into
eastern cultures and literature were often self-fulfilling. It was
accepted as a common fact that Asians, Arabs, and Indians were mystical
religious devotees incapable of rigorous rationality]{.underline}. It is
unsurprising, therefore that so many early European studies into, for
instance, Persian poetry, discovered nothing more or less than the terms
of their inquiry were able to allow: mystical religious devotion and an
absence of rationality. [Political Dominance. Said showed that the myth
of the Oriental was possible because of European political dominance of
the Middle East and Asia]{.underline}. In this aspect of his thought he
was strongly influenced by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. The
influence from Foucault is wide-ranging and thorough, but it is perhaps
most pronounced when [Said argues that Orientalism is a full-fledged
discourse, not just a simple idea, and when he suggests that all
knowledge is produced in situations of unequal relations of
power]{.underline}. In short[, a person who dominates another is the
only one in a position to write a book about it, to establish it, to
define it. It's not a particular moral failing that the stereotypical
failing defined as Orientalism emerged in western thinking, and not
somewhere else]{.underline}.

### Iran

#### Historically the sale of arms to Iran is directly tied to maintaining the US power structure

**Little 08**

(Douglas Little, University of North Carolina Press, \"American
Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945 \", 2008
Kyle Shah)\
The policies that the Carter administration inherited from Nixon and
Ford seemed, at first glance, to constitute low-risk, cost-effective
tactics for preventing trouble in a strategically important part of the
world. [[U.S. efforts "to assist and encourage Iran to become a regional
power which would assume limited security responsibilities and play a
generally more active role supportive of our mutual interests,]{.mark}"
a State Department transition briefing paper pointed out on 3 January
1977, had largely succeeded. ["Iran has accepted this role---for it was
consistent with the Shah's view of Iran's key position in the
area]{.mark}]{.underline}---and has used its military power (in Oman),
its financial strength (loans to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt,
Jordan and Syria) and its general influence to help resolve regional
disputes."133 Cyrus Vance, who moved into the seventh floor at Foggy
Bottom three weeks later, saw a certain logic to recent U.S. policy in
the region. "The Shah's determination that Iran must assume more
responsibility in the gulf coincided with the adoption of the 'Nixon
Doctrine' which envisioned key regional states as surrogates for
American military power in preserving order and blocking Soviet
inroads," Vance recalled in his memoirs, and the Carter administration
"recognized the importance of Iran in Persian Gulf security matters."134
National security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who second-guessed Cyrus
Vance on just about everything from human rights to nuclear disarmament,
shared the secretary of state's faith in the Nixon Doctrine in the
Persian Gulf. Praising Carter's predecessors for "building up" Iran and
Saudi Arabia "as the two American-backed pillars of regional security,"
Brzezinski agreed that the shah had become "our major strategic asset in
the wake of the British disengagement from 'east of Suez'" during the
Nixon and Ford years. [["Recognizing Iran's strategic centrality," he
remarked several years later, "we chose]{.mark} to a ta l e o f f o u r
d o c t r i n e s 147 continue that policy, [approving]{.mark} [major
sales of arms" to the shah, whose realm was the "pivot of a protected
tier shielding the crucial oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf from
possible Soviet intrusion."]{.mark}]{.underline}135 Gary Sick, a
holdover from the Ford administration who quickly emerged as the chief
Iran specialist in the Carter White House, confirmed that "the
Nixon-Kissinger policy of [placing [U.S. security interests in the
Persian Gulf almost exclusively in the hands of the shah had been fully
absorbed by the bureaucracy and the U.S. power
structure.]{.mark}]{.underline}" But for Sick the downside to the Nixon
Doctrine was obvious. "The United States now lay strategically naked
beneath the thin blanket of Iranian security," he observed long
afterward. ["[By the time President Carter arrived in the White
House]{.underline}]{.mark}[," Sick added, ["whether one liked it or not,
Iran was the regional tail wagging the superpower dog."]{.mark}136 [By
all accounts Jimmy Carter liked it less and less the longer he was in
office. Worried that continued U.S. arms sales to the shah and other
autocratic Third World clients under the auspices of the Nixon Doctrine
would divert resources from economic development, weaken respect for
human rights, and, in the long run, undermine political
stability,]{.mark}]{.underline} Carter sent Secretary of State Vance to
Tehran in May 1977 in hopes of developing "a better way of determining
Iran's future military needs and how they could best be met." Vance
assured the shah that [[the Carter administration still wished to work
closely with him on a plan "for denying the Soviets opportunities to
increase their influence" in the Persian Gulf. He confirmed that
Washington would deliver the F-16 jet fighters and awacs electronic
surveillance aircraft that Iran had ordered
earlier]{.underline}]{.mark}, but not high-performance F-18
fighter-bombers. He gently reminded the shah that the Georgia Democrat
regarded "the primacy of human rights as a national goal."

[rules and legal constraints may be, we can ultimately do whatever we

Rather]{.underline}, [[the threat was externalized]{.underline},

### Nuclear war 

#### Orientalism proposes the idea that North Korea and the Middle East cannot be trusted with weapons, and those weapons are better off with the US. However, Empirics and history prove that the US is just as dangerous in possession of nuclear weaponry as the Orient.

Once again, the Crazy Emperor of the Hermit Kingdom - North Korea - is
threatening nuclear war. Or so the media would have us believe. [The BBC
and other news outlets have taken to publishing maps with concentric
rings donating the speculative ranges of North Korea\'s creaky missile
systems.]{.underline} One never tested missile might possibly reach
Alaska and do for Sarah Palin and the polar bears. [[The basic idea
purveyed by the media and by US spokespersons is that Oriental
despotisms -as Iran and North Korea are regularly portrayed - cannot
possibly be trusted with nuclear weapons.]{.mark} Accordingly, US
policy, to which the UN and much of the world have subscribed, is that
it will \"never accept\" an Iranian or North Korean bomb. [While
rational people would never use a nuclear weapon except in circumstances
in which it was rational to do so,]{.mark} unbalanced, crazy types might
decide to unleash their nuclear arsenals, or turn them over to
terrorists, or what not.**[ It would seem that only rational Western
nations like the US can be trusted with
nukes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Images of Mad Mullahs and Asiatic Despots
aside, [there are obvious reasons why Iran and North Korea would want
nuclear weapons. Most significantly, a nuclear weapon is a guarantee
that they will not suffer the same fate as Iraq in 2003.]{.underline}
One of the only times it is rational and credible to make nuclear
threats is in a situation of existential crisis - when regime survival
is at stake. For this reason, no one invades or pushes too far a power
armed with nuclear weapons. Were Iran or North Korea to use a nuclear
weapon in any other circumstance, they would face obliteration. Since
nuclear weapons can be traced to their origin, it would be suicidal for
these countries to provide weapons to terrorist groups. Such groups do
not have a country to lose, unlike the leaderships of Iran and North
Korea. [So if Iran and North Korea turn out to have rational reasons for
pursuing nuclear weapons, and are likely to be governed by the same
realities of nuclear deterrence that constrained the US and the Soviet
Union in the Cold War, what about the rationality of US policy? For one,
for the US to say it will \"never accept\" what is already a reality is
an absurdity]{.underline}: North Korea already has the bomb. It must now
be treated as a nuclear power. More broadly, [[the recent history of US
foreign policy is not exactly a testament to rationality.]{.underline}
[In response to a terrorist attack which killed nearly 3,000 of its
citizens, the US invaded two countries, starting wars that resulted in
the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Ten years later, it has lost both
of those wars and broken its budget. Luckily, not every country that
suffers from terrorism reacts with such deadly and self-defeating spasms
of revenge and blood lust. North Korea has in living memory suffered
from the wanton destructiveness of US policy.]{.underline} [This is a
fact which must be remembered in the face of media images of North
Korea\'s supposedly irrational militarism and aggressiveness. Over the
three years of the Korean War, in
the [words](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/01/hitchens-200101) of
General Curtis LeMay, the US Air Force \"burned down **every** town in
North and South Korea\". The US used [12,000 pound \"Tarzan\"
bombs](http://mondediplo.com/2004/12/08korea) until there were no more
targets for them, in addition to thousands upon thousands of bombing
sorties]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Thousand pound napalm bombs
were dropped from B-29s to \"wipe out all life\" in tactical
localities[. [Towards the end of the war, the US bombed North Korea\'s
dams. One resulting flood \"scooped clean\" 27 miles of river
valley. **Moreover, it is the US which has made repeated nuclear threats
against North Korea, despite the fact that North Korea has never posed a
serious threat to the US**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The
use of nuclear weapons was considered several times during the Korean
War, both tactical and strategic. In April 1951, B-29s with nuclear
weapons were [deployed to
Guam](http://www.isodarco.it/courses/andalo09/doc/holloway_reading-CHCW.pdf),
ready for use if China escalated its conventional involvement in the
war. Later in the war, lone B-29s simulated nuclear attack runs on
Pyongyang. [[Over the course of the war, a million North Korean
civilians were killed by US]{.mark},]{.underline} UN and South Korean
forces. [**[This history offers some perspective on the recent crisis,
which began not with North Korean threats but with
US]{.mark}**]{.underline} and South Korean **[[war games and
manoeuvres]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These included practice sorties by
two nuclear capable B-2 stealth bombers sent over South Korea, loudly
announced in the media so that the point would not be lost on North
Korea\'s leaders. North Korea responded with bombast, including the
incredible notion that it was preparing an amphibious [invasion of the
US](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/29/north-korea-attack-us-what-happens-next).
Guam, still a base for US nuclear bombers, was \"threatened\" by North
Korea\'s jury-rigged missiles. In turn, the US deployed its equally
ineffective but much more expensive THAAD [missile defence
system](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9970346/Pentagon-sends-missile-defences-to-Guam-as-North-Korea-approves-nuclear-attack-on-US.html) to
Guam. One wonders what is more laughable: the idea that North Korea
could hit a speck in the Pacific like Guam or that the boondoggle
offspring of Ronald Reagan\'s Star Wars might actually work. What is not
laughable is the fact that it is the US which has a consistent pattern
of threatening the use - including first use - of nuclear weapons. [No
one is in doubt that US nuclear weapons actually work, and the US
remains the only power ever to have used them in anger. Notably, it used
them in a situation in which it was itself no longer threatened. The
North Korean bomb may be an uncomfortable fact of life. But so too is
the US bomb]{.underline}. And none of us should make any easy
assumptions about the rationality of the leadership of either country,
however. 

#### The Nuclear war rhetoric of the aff is rooted within the logic of nuclear orientalism

[There is a common perception in the West that nuclear weapons are most
dan- gerous when they are in the hands of Third World
leaders.]{.underline} I first became inter- ested in this perception
while interviewing nuclear weapons designers for an ethnographic study
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)- one of three
laboratories where U.S. nuclear weapons are designed (Gusterson 1996). I
made a point of asking each scientist if he or she thought nuclear weap-
ons would be used in my lifetime. Almost all said that they thought it
unlikely that the United States or the Russians would initiate the use
of nuclear weapons, but [most thought that nuclear weapons would
probably be used-by a Third World country]{.underline}. The laboratory
took a similar position as an institution. For example, using
terminology with distinctly colonial overtones to argue for continued
weapons research after the end of the Cold War, an official laboratory
pamphlet said, [Political, diplomatic, and military experts believe that
wars of the future will most likely be \"tribal conflicts\" between
neighboring Third World countries or between ethnic groups in the same
country.]{.underline} While the Cold War may be over, these [small
disputes may be more dangerous than a war between the
superpowers]{.underline}, because smaller nations with deep-seated
grievances against each other may lack the re- straint that has been
exercised by the US and the USSR. The existence of such po- tential
conflicts and the continued danger of nuclear holocaust underscore the
need for continued weapons research. \[LLNL 1 [It is not only nuclear
weapons scientists who believe that nuclear weapons are much safer in
the hands of the established nuclear powers than Third World
countries]{.underline}. [There has long been a widespread perception
U.S. defense intellectuals, politicians, and pundits-leaders of op clear
weapons]{.underline}-that, while we can live with the nuclear weapons of
ficial nuclear nations for the indefinite future, the proliferation of
ons to nuclear-threshold states in the Third World, especially the I
would be enormously dangerous. This orthodoxy is so much a part tive
common sense that, like all common sense, it can usually be st fact
without fear of contradiction (Geertz 1983). It is widespread and in
learned journals,\' and it is shared by liberals as well as conse
example, just as Kenneth Adelman, a senior official in the Reagan tion,
has said that \"the real danger comes from some miserable The country
which decides to use these weapons either out of desperati ity\" (1988),
at the same time Hans Bethe-a physicist revered by m work on behalf of
disarmament over many decades-has said, \"[The nuclear weapons in the
hands of more responsible countries to deter such use by Third World
nations]{.underline} (Bernard 1994, quoted in Shroyer 1998:24 [Western
alarmism about the dangers of nuclear weapons in The hands was
particularly evident when India and Pakistan set off th nuclear
tests]{.underline} in May 1998. Many analysts had already identified So
the most likely site in the world for a nuclear war. After India\'s
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (Democrat, New York) said, \"[If Pakis bomb, we
are on the edge of nuclear warfare]{.underline}\" (1998). Three days l
ing Pakistan\'s tests, Moynihan elicited agreement from Senator J
(Republican, Arizona) when he said that the world was \"closer to n than
we have been any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis\" (A Speaking to
Reuters wire service, David Albright, president of the institute for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D. [I don\'t think
they \[India and Pakistan\] are up to the task of preventional conflict
from accidentally slipping into a nuclear exchange.\"]{.underline}
washington Post agreed: \"Today, in the aftermath of a series of test
explosions by the bitter rivals, there is no place on earth with greater
potential of a nuclear war\" (Moore and Khan 1998:1).

#### The Nuclear Apartheid is rooted within an orientalist discourse in which who has the capabilities to gain nuclear weapons and who is restricted from accessing them are defined in binary opposition

According to the literature on risk in anthropology, shared fears often
veal as much about the identities and solidarities of the fearful as
about the actual dangers that are feared (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982;
Lindenbaum 1974). [The immoderate reactions in the West to the nuclear
tests conducted by India and Pakistan, and to Iraq\'s nuclear weapons
program earlier,]{.underline} [are examples of an entrenched discourse
on nuclear proliferation that has played an important role in
structuring the Third World, and our relation to it, in the Western
imagination]{.underline}. This discourse, [dividing the world into
nations that can be trusted with nuclear weapons and those that cannot,
dates back,]{.underline} at least, [to the Non-Proliferation Treaty of
1970.]{.underline} The Non-Proliferation Treaty embodied a bargain
between the five coun- tries that had nuclear weapons in 1970 and those
countries that did not. Accord- ing to the bargain, the five official
nuclear states (the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,
France, and China)3 promised to assist other signa- tories to the treaty
in acquiring nuclear energy technology as long as they did not use that
technology to produce nuclear weapons, submitting to international in-
spections when necessary to prove their compliance. Further, in Article
6 of the treaty, [the five nuclear powers agreed to \"pursue
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation
of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}\" (Blacker and Duffy 1976:395). [One hundred
eighty-seven countries have signed the treaty, but Israel, India, and
Pakistan have refused, saying it enshrines a system of global \"nuclear
apartheid.\"]{.underline} Al- though the Non-Proliferation Treaty
divided the countries of the world into nu- clear and nonnuclear by
means of a purely temporal metric4-designating only those who had tested
nuclear weapons by 1970 as nuclear powers-the treaty has become the
legal anchor for a global nuclear regime that is increasingly le-
gitimated in Western public discourse in racialized terms. In view
developments in global politics-the collapse of the Soviet threat a war
against Iraq, a nuclear-threshold nation in the Third World-th of this
discourse in organizing Western geopolitical understand growing. It has
become an increasingly important way of legitimatary programs in the
post-Cold War world since the early 199 military leaders introduced the
term rogue states into the Amer fear, identifying a new source of danger
just as the Soviet threat (Klare 1995). Thus [in Western discourse
nuclear weapons are represented so that \"theirs\" are a problem whereas
\"ours\" are not.]{.underline} During the Cold War [the Western dis-
course on the dangers of \"nuclear proliferation\" defined the term in
such a way as to sever the two senses of the word
proliferation.]{.underline} This usage split off the \"ver- tical\"
proliferation of the superpower arsenals (the development of new and im-
proved weapons designs and the numerical expansion of the stockpiles)
from the \"horizontal\" proliferation of nuclear weapons to other
countries, presenting only the latter as the \"proliferation problem.\"
Following the end of the Cold War, the American and Russian arsenals are
being cut to a few thousand weap- ons on each side.5 However, the United
States and Russia have turned back ap- peals from various nonaligned
nations, especially India, for the nuclear powers to open discussions on
a global convention abolishing nuclear weapons. Article 6 of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty notwithstanding, the Clinton administration has
declared that nuclear weapons will play a role in the defense of the
United States for the indefinite future. Meanwhile, in a controversial
move, the Clinton administration has broken with the policy of previous
administrations in basi- cally formalizing a policy of using nuclear
weapons against nonnuclear states to deter chemical and biological
weapons (Panofsky 1998; Sloyan 1998). [The dominant discourse that
stabilizes this system of nuclear apartheid in Western ideology is a
specialized variant within a broader system of colonial and postcolonial
discourse that takes as its essentialist premise a profound Oth- erness
separating Third World from Western countries.]{.underline}6 [This
inscription of Third World]{.underline} (especially Asian and Middle
Eastern) [nations as ineradicably dif- ferent from our own
has]{.underline}, in a different context, [been labeled
\"Orientalism\"]{.underline} by Edward Said (1978). Said argues that
[orientalist discourse constructs the world in terms of a series of
binary oppositions that produce the Orient as the mirror image of the
West: where \"we\" are rational and disciplined, \"they\" are impul-
sive and emotional; where \"we\" are modern and flexible, \"they\" are
slaves to an- cient passions and routines; where \"we\" are honest and
compassionate, \"they\" are treacherous and uncultivated]{.underline}.
While the blatantly racist orientalism of the high colonial period has
softened, more subtle orientalist ideologies endure in contemporary
politics. They can be found, as Akhil Gupta (1998) has argued, in
discourses of economic development that represent Third World nations as
child nations lagging behind Western nations in a uniform cycle of
development or, as Lutz and Collins (1993) suggest, in the imagery of
popular magazines, such as National Geographic. I want to suggest here
that another variant of contempo- rary orientalist ideology is also to
be found in U.S. national security discourse. Following Anthony Giddens
(1979), I define ideology as a structuring political ideas,
institutions, and behavior which (1) make structures and institutions
created by dominant social groups, c tions appear to be naturally given
and inescapable rather th structed; (2) presents the interests of elites
as if they were unive obscures the connections between different social
and political as to inhibit massive, binary confrontations (i.e.,
revolutionary (4) legitimates domination. [The Western discourse on
nuclear pr ideological in all four of these senses: (1) it makes the
simultane of nuclear weapons by the major powers and the absence of
nuclear weapons Third World countries seem natural and reasonable while
problematizing atempts by such countries as India, Pakistan, and Iraq to
acquire (2) it presents the security needs of the established nuclear
pow were everybody\'s; (3) it effaces the continuity between Third World
nuclear deprivation and other systematic patterns of
deprivation]{.underline} [in the underdeveloped world in order to
inhibit a massive north-south confrontation; and (4) it legitimates the
nuclear monopoly of the recognize nuclear powers.]{.underline}

#### ARM SALES lead to the criminalization of middle east over gaining nuclear weapon capabilities that perpetuates the logic of orientalism in which the west must police the east with its nuclear weapons

[The particular images and metaphors that recur in the discourse on
prolif- eration represent Third World nations as criminals, women, and
children]{.underline}. But [these recurrent images and
metaphors,]{.underline} all of which pertain in some way to dis- order[,
can also be read as telling hints about the facets of our own psychology
and culture which we find especially troubling in regard to our
custodianship over nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The [metaphors and
images are part of the ideological ar- mor the West wears in the nuclear
age, but they are also clues that suggest bur- ied, denied, and
troubling parts of ourselves that have mysteriously surfaced in our
distorted representations of the Other.]{.underline} As Akhil Gupta has
argued in his analysis of a different orientalist discourse, the
discourse on development, \"within development discourse .. . lies its
shadowy double \... a virtual pres- ence, inappropriate objects that
serve to open up the \'developed world\' itself as an inappropriate
object\" (1998:4). In the era of so-called rogue states, one recurrent
theme in this system of representations is that of the thief, liar, and
criminal: [the very attempt to come into possession of nuclear weapons
is often cast in terms of racketeering and crime. After the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests]{.underline}, one newspaper headline read, \"G-8
Nations Move to Punish Nuclear Outlaws\" (Reid 1998:1), thereby
[characterizing the two countries as criminals even though neither had
signed-and hence violated-either the Non-Proliferation Treaty or the
Com- prehensive Test Ban Treaty.]{.underline} When British [customs
officers intercepted a ship- ment of krytrons destined for Iraq\'s
nuclear weapons program]{.underline}, [one newspaper account said that
Saddam Hussein was \"caught red-handed trying to steal]{.underline}
atomic detonators\" (Perlmutter 1990, emphasis added)-[a curious choice
of words given that Iraq had paid good money to buy the krytrons from
the com- pany EG&G. (]{.underline}In fact, if any nation can be accused
of theft here, surely it is the United States, which took \$650 million
from Pakistan for a shipment of F-16s, cancelled the shipment when the
Bush administration determined that Pakistan was seeking to acquire
nuclear weapons, but never refunded the money.) Ac- cording to an
article in the New York Times, \"it required more than three de- cades,
a global network of theft and espionage, and uncounted millions for
Paki- stan, one of the world\'s poorest countries, to explode that
bomb\" (Weiner 1998:6). Meanwhile [the same paper\'s editorial page
lamented that \"for years Pakistan has lied to the U.S. about not having
a nuclear weapons program\" and insisted that the United States \"punish
Pakistan\'s perfidy on the Bomb]{.underline}\" (New York Times
1987a:A34, 1987b:A34). And Representative Stephen Solarz (Democrat, New
York) warns that the bomb will give Pakistan \"the nuclear equivalent of
a Saturday Night Special\" (Smith 1988:38). The image of the Sat- urday
night special assimilates Pakistan symbolically to the disorderly under-
world of ghetto hoodlums who rob corer stores and fight gang wars. [U.S.
nu- clear weapons are, presumably, more like the \"legitimate\" weapons
carried by the police to maintain order and keep the
peace.l8]{.underline}

[Third World nations acquiring nuclear weapons are also described of
passions escaping control.]{.underline} In [Western discourse the
passionate, or instinctual has long been identified with women and
animals and implicitly contrasted male human rationality]{.underline}
(Haraway 1990; Merchant 1980; Rosaldo 1 [certain recurrent figures of
speech in the Western discourse on proliferation cast proliferant
nations in the Third World in imagery that carries a subtle or subhuman
connotation.]{.underline} Whereas [the United States is spoken of as
having vital interests\" and \"legitimate security needs,\" Third World
nations have \" \"longings,\" and \"yearnings\" for nuclear weapons
which must be cont contained by the strong male and adult hand of
America.]{.underline} Pakistan h dent ardor for the Bomb,\" says a New
York Times editorial (1987a:A Rosenfeld, writing in the Washington Post,
worries that the United St forever \"stifle \[Pakistan\'s\] nuclear
longings\" (1987:A27). Represe Markey (Democrat, Massachusetts),
agreeing, warns in a letter to th ton Post that America\'s weakness in
its relationship with Pakistan m the Pakistanis \"can feed nuclear
passions at home and still receive mas tary aid from America\"
(1987:A22). The image is of the unfaithful sponging off her cuckolded
husband. But throwing the woman out may cause even more disorder: the W
Post editorial page, having described [Pakistan\'s nuclear weapons
program in an allusion to the ultimate symbol of Muslim femininity-as
conceale a veil of secrecy]{.underline},\" goes on to warn that there
are \"advantages to \... ha stan stay in a close and constraining
security relationship with the Un rather than be cast out by an aid
cutoff into a loneliness in which i could only grow\" (1987:A22). Thus,

parental figure]{.underline}. The message is succinctly conveyed by o

Pakistan and \"U.S. demands for good Pakistani behavior from now on"
(1987a:A34). [Some commentators fear that the U.S. parental style is
permissive and will encourage misbehavior by Pakistan\'s naughty
siblings: advocated an aid cutoff said the time had come for the United
States to set an example for other would-be nuclear

credibility is on the line, the New York Times says that \"all manner of
reason and arguments have been tried with Pakistani leaders. It\'s time
for stronger steps\" (1987a:A34). [These metaphorical representations of

global hierarchy of nations, telling us that, like women, children, and
criminals, Third World na- tions have their proper place.]{.underline}

#### Discourse Surrounding Nuclear War is rooted within desire for the political conditions to conquer the Orient

(Amardeep Singh, Associate Professor of English at Lehigh University,
9-24-2004, \"Amardeep Singh: An Introduction to Edward Said,
Orientalism, and Postcolonial Literary Studies,\"
<https://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/09/introduction-to-edward-said.html,DMW)>

[Orientalism was a book about a particular pattern in western thought.
It was not, in and of itself, an evaluation of the importance of that
thought.]{.underline} It was written before the peak of the academic
'culture wars', when key words like relativism, pluralism, and
multiculturalism would be the order of the day. [Said has often been
lumped in with relativists and pluralists, but in fact he doesn't belong
there.]{.underline} In his later literary and cultural work, especially
in *Culture and Imperialism* [Said generally avoided the language of
confrontation]{.underline}. Where others have angrily rejected the
literary heritage of the Western Canon, Said, has instead embraced it,
albeit ambivalently. Where others denounced Joseph Conrad and Rudyard
Kipling as racist dead white men, Said wrote careful reappraisals of
their works, focusing on their representations of India and Africa
respectively. Said did not apologize for, for instance, Joseph Conrad's
image of the Congo as an essentially corrupting place inhabited by
ruthless cannibals. But Said did acknowledge Conrad's gift for *style*,
and explored its implications: Conrad was sophisticated enough to sense
that he did indeed have a blind spot. Conrad recognized that the idea of
imperialism was an illusion, built entirely on a very fragile mythic
rhetoric. You see some of this in [the famous quote from Heart of
Darkness]{.underline}: [The conquest of the earth, which mostly means
the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or
slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you
look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the
back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish
belief in the idea \-- something you can set up, and bow down before,
and offer a sacrifice to. . . .\" The lines are spoken by the sailor
Marlowe]{.underline}, who was in effect [an observer-participant to the
scene of Kurtz's fatal breakdown in the upper Congo]{.underline}. [He is
a veteran, of the colonial system]{.underline}, and this is the first
place where his views become apparent. Like many others in his trade,
Marlowe was in fact ambivalent about what was, in effect, his job. [He
knows the violence of it and the potential evil of it, but he still
tries to justify it through recourse to the \"idea at the back of it.\"
But even more puzzling: that \"idea at the back of it\" is not an idea
of reason, or human rights, or technology (or the pursuit of weapons of
mass destruction). The idea is something to \"bow down before, offer a
sacrifice to\...\" The desire to conquer the earth, in short, is as
irrational a desire as any. Said refers to this passage]{.underline} a
few times in his essays. One such response is as follows, where S[aid
sketches an account of the political conditions that made imperialism
possible]{.underline} in England and France, as well as general readings
of several works of literature. I quote at length because this is a
perfect example of Said's ability to blend political/historical analysis
with literary criticism: But there\'s more than that to imperialism.
[There was a commitment to imperialism over and above profit, a
commitment in constant circulation and recirculation]{.underline} which
on the one hand allowed decent men and women from England or France,
from London or Paris[, to accept the notion that distant territories and
their native peoples should be subjugated and, on the other hand,
replenished metropolitan energies so that these decent people could
think of the empire as a protracted, almost metaphysical obligation to
rule subordinate, inferior or less advanced peoples.]{.underline} We
mustn\'t forget, and this is a very important aspect of my topic, that
there was very little domestic resistance inside Britain and France.
There was a kind of tremendous unanimity on the question of having an
empire. [There was very little domestic resistance to imperial expansion
during the nineteenth century, although these empires were very
frequently established and maintained under adverse and even
disadvantageous conditions.]{.underline} Not only were immense hardships
in the African wilds or wastes, the \"dark continent,\" as it was called
in the latter part of the nineteenth century, endured by the white
colonizers, but there was always the tremendously risky physical
disparity between a small number of Europeans at a very great distance
from home and a much larger number of natives on their home territory.
In India, for instance, by the 1930s, a mere 4,000 British civil
servants, assisted by 60,000 soldiers and 90,000 civilians, had billeted
themselves upon a country of 300,000,000 people. The will,
self-confidence, even arrogance necessary to maintain such a state of
affairs could only be guessed at. But as one can see in the texts of
novels like Forster\'s *Passage to India* or Kipling\'s *Kim*, these
attitudes are at least as significant as the number of people in the
army or civil service or the millions of pounds that England derived
from India. For [the enterprise of empire depends upon the idea of
having an empire,]{.underline} as Joseph Conrad so powerfully seems to
have realized in *Heart of Darkness*. He says that the difference
between us in the modern period, the modern imperialists, and the Romans
is that the Romans were there just for the loot. They were just
stealing. But we go there with an idea. He was thinking, obviously, of
the idea, for instance in Africa, of the French and the Belgians that
when you go to these continents you\'re not just robbing the people of
their ivory and slaves and so on. You are improving them in some way.
I\'m really quite serious. The idea, for example, of the French empire
was that France had a \"mission civilisatrice,\" that it was there to
civilize the natives. It was a very powerful idea. Obviously, not so
many of the natives believed it, but the French believed that that was
what they were doing. [The idea of having an empire is very important,
and that is the central feature that I am interested in. All kinds of
preparations are made for this idea within a culture and then, in turn
and in time, imperialism acquires a kind of coherence, a set of
experiences and a presence of ruler and ruled alike within the
culture.]{.underline} (see
<http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barsaid.htm>) A final point, about
postcolonial studies. The development of Said's ideas about literature
and art paralleled those of the field of post-colonial criticism as a
whole. It began in anger -- Frantz Fanon, Aime Cesaire, Malcolm X. And
it has ended up in a rather different place, embraced in the very
academic settings that once might have laughed at the very notion of a
canonical body of, say, African Literature. Post-colonial criticism,
which began under the combative spiritual aegis of \[Frantz\] Fanon and
\[Aime\] Césaire, went further than either of them in showing the
existence of what in Culture and Imperialism I called \'overlapping
territories\' and \'intertwined histories\'. Many of us who grew up in
the colonial era were struck by the fact that even though a hard and
fast line separated colonizer from colonized in matters of rule and
authority (a native could never aspire to the condition of the white
man), the experiences of ruler and ruled were not so easily
disentangled. (from the *London Review of Books*:
<http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n06/said01_.html>) That means that nativism
cannot be an effective answer to western hegemony (later he gets more
specific: \"Afrocentrism is as flawed as Eurocentrism\"). There's no
simple way to achieve decolonization, just as (in the more limited
context of the United States), there's no simple way for anyone to
disentangle him or herself from the effects of racism. But it also means
that, in many respects, colonialism is still with us[. It was through
the colonial system that most of the national borders in Africa and Asia
were drawn up, in many cases arbitrarily. But more than that are the
effects of colonial language, the colonial state bureaucracy, and
especially colonial attitudes to things like economic
development.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear war claims function inside of the binary created Orientalist discourses-- Saying we are to be trusted and they are to be feared in reference to the East

There has long [been a widespread perception among U.S. defense
intellectuals, politicians and pundits that, while we can live with the
nuclear weapons of the five official nuclear nations for the indefinite
future, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to nuclear-threshold states
in the Third World, especially the Islamic world, would be enormously
dangerous]{.underline}. This orthodoxy is so much a part of our
collective common sense that, like all common sense, it can usually be
stated as simple fact without fear of contradiction. It is widely found
in the media and in learned journals, and it is shared by liberals as
well as conservatives. For example, just as Kenneth Adelman, a senior
official in the Reagan administration, said that [["the real danger
comes from some miserable Third World country which decides to use these
weapons either out of desperation or incivility,"]{.underline}]{.mark}2
at the same time Hans Bethe---a physicist revered by many for his work
on behalf of disarmament over many decades---said, [["There have to be
nuclear weapons in the hands of more responsible countries to deter such
use"]{.mark} by Third World nations]{.underline}.3 [Western alarmism
about the dangers of nuclear weapons in Third World hands was
particularly evident when India and Pakistan set off their salvos of
nuclear tests in May 1998]{.underline}. Many analysts had already
identified South Asia as the likeliest site in the world for a nuclear
war[. Soon [after India's tests]{.mark}, Senator Daniel Patrick
[Moynihan said]{.mark} on The Charlie Rose Show, "[If Pakistan tests the
bomb, we are on the edge of nuclear warfare."]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Three days later, following Pakistan's tests, Senator John McCain said
that the world was "closer to nuclear war than we have been any time
since the Cuban Missile Crisis."]{.underline}4 Speaking 2 Audit of the
Conventional Wisdom to Reuters, David Albright, president of the liberal
Institute for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.,
opined, "I don't think they \[India and Pakistan\] are up to the task of
preventing a conventional conflict from accidentally slipping into a
nuclear exchange." 5 Nuclear Orientalism [According to the
anthropological literature on risk, shared fears often reveal as much
about the identities and solidarities of the fearful as about the actual
dangers that are feared. **[The immoderate reactions in the West to the
nuclear tests conducted]{.mark} in 1998 [by India and Pakistan, and to
Iraq's nuclear weapons]{.mark} program earlier, [are examples of an
entrenched discourse on nuclear proliferation that has played an
important role in structuring the Third World, and our relation to it,
in the Western imagination]{.mark}**. This discourse, dividing the world
into nations that can be trusted with nuclear weapons and those that
cannot, dates back, at least, to the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970.
[The Non-Proliferation Treaty]{.mark} [embodied a bargain between the
five countries that had nuclear weapons]{.mark} in 1970 [and]{.mark}
those [countries that did not]{.mark}.]{.underline} [According to the
bargain, [the]{.mark} five official nuclear [states]{.mark} (the United
States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China)
[promised to assist other signatories to the treaty in acquiring nuclear
energy technology as long as they did not use that technology to produce
nuclear weapons]{.mark}, submitting to international inspections when
necessary to prove their compliance. F]{.underline}urther, in Article 6
of the treaty, the five nuclear powers agreed to pursue "negotiations in
good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament." **[One hundred
eighty-seven countries have signed the treaty. [Saying it enshrines a
system of global 'nuclear apartheid,' Israel, India, and Pakistan have
refused \[the treaty\]]{.mark}.]{.underline}** North Korea has withdrawn
[from the treaty.]{.underline} **[[The]{.mark} Non-Proliferation [Treaty
has become the legal anchor for a global nuclear regime that is
increasingly legitimated in Western public discourse in racialized
terms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In view of recent developments in global
politics---[the collapse of the Soviet Union, two wars against Iraq, and
international crises over the nuclear weapons programs of North Korea
and Iran---the importance of this discourse in organizing Western
geopolitical understandings is only growing. It has become an
increasingly important way of legitimating U.S. military programs in the
post-cold war world, where "[rogue states" have supplanted the old evil
empire in the imaginations of American war
planners]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[The]{.mark} dominant [discourse that
stabilizes this system of nuclear apartheid in Western ideology
was]{.mark} labeled ["Orientalism]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (albeit in a
different context) by Edward Said. According to Said, **[[orientalist
discourse constructs the world in terms of a series of binary
oppositions that produce the Orient as the mirror image of the
West]{.mark}: [where "we" are rational]{.mark} and disciplined, "[they"
are impulsive]{.mark} and emotional; where ["we" are modern]{.mark} and
flexible, "[they" are slaves]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [ancient]{.mark}
passions and [routines]{.mark}; where ["we" are honest]{.mark} and
compassionate, "[they" are treacherous]{.mark} and
uncultivated]{.underline}**.6 While **[[the]{.mark} blatantly [racist
orientalism of the high colonial period has]{.mark} [softened,]{.mark}
[more subtle orientalist ideologies endure in contemporary politics and
are applicable here]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Four Common Arguments
Against Proliferation Following are four arguments about nuclear
proliferation that are integral to this orientalist common sense. I
contend that all four are based on an assumption that **["[we" can be
trusted with nuclear weapons while "they"
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[[an assumption that cannot be sustained
when the evidence from nuclear history is examined more
closely]{.underline}.]{.mark} 1. Third World Countries Are Too Poor to
Afford Nuclear Weapons It is often said that it is inappropriate for
Third World countries to squander money on nuclear weapons when they
have such pressing problems of poverty, hunger, and homelessness on
which the money might more appropriately be spent. For example, when
India conducted its "peaceful nuclear explosion" on May 18, 1974, one
Washington official, condemning India for having the wrong priorities,
was quoted as saying, "I don't see how this is going to grow more rice."
7 Similar comments were made after the Indian and Pakistani nuclear
tests of 1998. Mary McGrory, for example, wrote in her column in the
Washington Post that "two large, poor countries in desperate need of
schools, hospitals, and education are strewing billions of dollars for
nuclear development." 8 Such statements are not necessarily wrong, but
read with a critical eye, they have a recursive effect that potentially
undermines the rationale for military programs in the West as well.
First, one can interrogate denunciations of profligate military spending
in the Third World by pointing out that Western countries, despite their
own extravagant levels of military spending, have by no means solved
their own social and economic problems. The United States, for example,
which at the time of India's nuclear tests in the mid1990s allotted 4
percent of its GNP to military spending against India's 2.8 percent,9
has for almost all of the past twenty-five years financed its military
budget by accumulating debt. Meanwhile, in the United States, advocates
for the homeless estimate that two million Americans have nowhere to
live, and another thirty-six million Americans live below the official
poverty line.10 Second, American taxpayers have consistently been told
that nuclear weapons are a bargain compared with the cost of
conventional weapons. They supposedly give "more bang for the buck." If
this is true for "us," then surely it is also true for "them": if a
developing nation has security concerns, then a nuclear weapon ought to
be the cheapest way to take care of them. Third, critics of U.S.
military spending have been told for years that military spending
stimulates economic development and produces such beneficial economic
spin-offs that it almost pays for itself. If military Keynesianism works
for "us," it is hard to see why it should not also work for "them." 2.
Deterrence Will Be Unstable in the Third World During the cold war,
**[Americans were told that nuclear deterrence prevented the smoldering
enmity between the superpowers from bursting into the full flame of war,
saving millions of lives by making conventional war too
dangerous.]{.underline}** When the practice of deterrence was challenged
by the antinuclear movement of the 1980s, Pentagon officials and
**[defense intellectuals warned that nuclear disarmament would just make
the world safe for conventional war.]{.underline}** Surely, **[then, we
should want countries such as Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran and Israel
also to enjoy the stabilizing benefits of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** [Western security specialists and media pundits
have argued, against this, that deterrence as practiced by the
superpowers during the cold war may not work in Third World
settings.]{.underline} One of the main reasons given is that Third World
adversaries tend to share common borders. As one commentator put it:
"While it would have taken more than a half-hour for a Soviet-based
nuclear missile to reach the United States---time at least for America
to double-check its computer screen or use the hotline---the striking
distance between India and Pakistan is no more than five minutes."11
However, this formulation focuses only on the difference in missile
flight times while ignoring the fact that the missiles deployed by the
two superpowers were, by the end of the cold war, MIRVED and
extraordinarily accurate. (MIRVed missiles---equipped with Multiple
Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicles---carry several warheads, each
capable of striking a different target). Some arms controllers worried
in the 1980s that the two superpowers were entering a destabilizing
"use-it-or-lose-it" situation where each would have to launch its
missiles immediately if it believed itself under attack. Thus, once one
adds accuracy and MIRVing to the strategic equation, the putative
contrast between stable deterrence in the West and unstable deterrence
in South Asia looks upside down, even if we were to grant the difference
in flight times between the cold war superpowers and between the main
adversaries in South Asia. But there is no reason to grant the alleged
difference in flight times. Michael Lev says that it would have taken
"more than half an hour" for American and Russian missiles to reach
their targets during the cold war. While this was true for land-based
ICBMs, it was not true for the submarine-launched missiles the
superpowers could move in against each other's coasts. Nor was it true
of the American Jupiter missiles stationed in Turkey, right up against
the Soviet border, in the early 1960s. Nor was it true of the Pershing
IIs deployed in Germany in the 1980s. When the antinuclear movement
claimed that it was destabilizing to move the Pershings to within less
than ten minutes' flight time of Moscow, **[the U.S. Government insisted
that anything that strengthened NATO's attack capability strengthened
nuclear deterrence.]{.underline}** **[Here again we see a double
standard in the arguments made to legitimate "our" nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. 3. Third World Governments Lack the Technical
Maturity to Handle Nuclear Weapons The third argument against horizontal
proliferation is that Third World nations may lack the technical
maturity to be trusted with nuclear weapons. The Washington Post quotes
an unnamed Western diplomat stationed in Pakistan, who, worrying that
India and Pakistan lack the technology to detect an incoming attack on
their weapons, said the United States has "expensive space-based
surveillance that could pick up the launches, but Pakistan and India
have no warning systems. I don't know what their doctrine will be.
Launch when the wind blows?"12 If one reviews the U.S. nuclear safety
record, the comforting dichotomy between a high-tech, safe "us" and
low-tech, unsafe "them" begins to look distinctly dubious. First, the
United States has not always made use of the safety technologies at its
disposal. Over the protests of some weapons designers, for example, the
navy decided not to incorporate state-of-the-art safety technologies
into one of its newest weapons, the Trident II, and it ignored the
recommendation of an expert panel that the Trident II be redesigned to
make it safer.13 Second, if one looks more closely at U.S. early-warning
systems, one finds that they create risks of their own. For example, it
was the high technology Aegis radar system, misread by a navy operator,
that was directly responsible for the tragically mistaken U.S. decision
to shoot down an Iranian commercial jetliner on July 3, 1988. Similarly,
and potentially more seriously, in 1979, the U.S. military began prepara
tions for nuclear war after a mistakenly inserted training tape led
personnel in the strategic command apparatus to think a Soviet attack
was underway. American interceptor planes were scrambled and air traffic
controllers were told to bring down commercial planes before U.S.
military commanders detected the error. As for the American safety
record in transporting and handling nuclear weapons, there is more cause
for relief than for complacency. There have, for example, been at least
twenty-four occasions when American aircraft have accidentally released
nuclear weapons and at least eight incidents where U.S. nuclear weapons
were involved in plane crashes or fires.14 In other words, the U.S.
nuclear arsenal has its own safety problems related to its dependence on
highly computerized warning and detection systems, the cold war practice
of patrolling oceans and skies with live nuclear weapons, and large
stockpile size. Even where U.S. scientists have developed special safety
technologies, they have not always been used. The presumption that Third
World countries lack the technical competence to be trusted with nuclear
weapons fits our stereotypes about those countries' backwardness, but it
distracts us from asking whether we ourselves have the technical
infallibility the weapons ideally require. The discourse on
proliferation assumes that the superpowers' massive arsenals of highly
accurate, MIRVed missiles deployed on hair-trigger alert were stable and
that the small, elemental arsenals of new nuclear nations would be
unstable, but one could quite plausibly argue the reverse. This leaves
one wondering whether prejudices about the weapons' owners are not
masquerading as technical concerns about weapons configurations and
safety protocols. 4. Third World Regimes Lack the Political Maturity to
Be Trusted with Nuclear Weapons The fourth argument concerns the
supposed political instability or irrationality of Third World
countries. Security specialists and media pundits worry that Third World
dictators free from democratic constraints are more likely to develop
and use nuclear weapons, that military officers in such countries will
be more likely to take possession of the weapons or use them on their
own initiative, or that Third World countries are more vulnerable to the
kinds of ancient hatred and religious fanaticism that could lead to the
use of nuclear weapons. These concerns bring us to the heart of
orientalist ideology. In the words of Richard Perle, a prominent
neoconservative, [nuclear weapons are "one thing in the hands of
governments animated by rational policies to protect national interests
and a normal regard for human life]{.underline}. They are quite another
in the hands of a brutal megalomaniac like Saddam who wouldn't blink at
the mass destruction of his enemies."15 Similarly, but on the other end
of the political spectrum, Senator Edward Kennedy warned that "nuclear
weapons in the arsenals of unstable Third World regimes are a clear and
present danger to all humanity. ... Dictators threatened with attack
along their borders or revolutions from within may not pause before
pressing the button. The scenarios are terrifying."16 The presumed
contrast between the West, where leaders are disciplined by democracy,
and the Third World, where they are not, does not hold up so well under
examination. The governments of Britain, France, and Israel, not to
mention the United States, all made their initial decisions to acquire
nuclear weapons without any public debate or knowledge. Only in India
was the question of whether or not to cross the nuclear threshold an
election issue. Pakistan also had a period of public debate before
conducting its first nuclear test. And how safe are the official nuclear
powers from coups d'état, renegade officers, or reckless leaders? France
came perilously close to revolution as recently as 1968, and in 1961 a
group of renegade French military officers took control of a nuclear
weapon at France's nuclear test site in the Sahara desert.17 Britain,
struggling to repress IRA bombing campaigns, has been engaged in
low-level civil war for most of the time it has possessed nuclear
weapons. The United States has, since it acquired nuclear weapons, seen
Presidents John F. Kennedy assassinated, Gerald Ford threatened with an
empty gun by a member of the Manson family, and Ronald Reagan wounded by
a gunman. There also have been problems with U.S. command and control.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis a group of military officers at
Malmstrom Air Force Base jerry-rigged their missiles so that they could
launch their nuclear weapons independently of the national command and
control structure and outside of normal procedures requiring multiple
officers to enable a launch.18 During the 1950s some senior U.S.
military leaders drew up plans for and advocated preemptive nuclear
attacks on the Soviet Union. One of these, Curtis LeMay, was by 1954
provoking the Soviets by sending U.S. reconnaissance flights over the
USSR---technically an act of war---despite President Truman's orders not
to do so. A New Discourse I do not want to minimize the potential
dangers of nuclear proliferation. But these dangers should not be
represented in ways that obscure both the dangers inherent in the
continued maintenance of our own nuclear arsenals and the fact that our
own actions are often a source of the instabilities we so fear in Third
World nations Where does this leave us? There are three different
discursive positions on proliferation, each pointing in the direction of
a very different global security regime, that do not embody the
"orientalist" double standard. The first, a position of exclusion, is
based pragmatically in the conventions of realpolitik. It involves the
candid declaration that, while nuclear weapons may be no more dangerous
in the hands of Muslims or Hindus than in those of Christians, they are
a prerogative of power, and the powerful have no intention of allowing
the powerless to acquire them. This is a position that, in its rejection
of easy racism and phony moralism, is at least honorable in its
frankness. The second position, participation, is based on Kenneth
Waltz's argument that all countries benefit from acquiring nuclear
weapons.19 This position may have more appeal in certain parts of the
Third World than in the West. It is the position of India, Israel, and
Pakistan, for example, which have, like the older nuclear nations,
sought to maximize their power and freedom by acquiring a nuclear
capability. These countries pursued nuclear weapons in search of greater
security vis-à-vis regional rivals and out of a desire to shift the
balance of power in their client relationships with the superpowers.
**[The third position, renunciation, breaks down the distinctions we
have constructed between "us" and "them" and asks whether nuclear
weapons are safe in anyone's hands]{.underline}**.
"What-must-on-no-account-be-known," says Salman Rushdie, is the
"impossible verity that savagery could be concealed beneath decency's
well-pressed shirt." [Our orientalist discourse on nuclear proliferation
is one of our ways not to know this.]{.underline} This position has been
nicely articulated by the late George Kennan: I see the danger not in
the number or quality of the weapons or in the intentions of those who
hold them but in the very existence of weapons of this nature,
regardless of whose hands they are in. \... I see no solution to the
problem other than the complete elimination of these and all other
weapons of mass destruction from national arsenals; and the sooner we
move toward that solution, and the greater courage we show in doing so,
the safer we will be.20

### [Terrorism]{.underline}

#### **The construction the middle eastern oriental is rooted within the ignorant image of the jihad menace and terrorism which positions the Arab world as a perpetual "other"**

**Little 08**

(Douglas Little, Professor of History and International Relations at
Clark University., \"American Orientalism: The United States and the
Middle East since 1945 \", University of North Carolina Press,  3^rd^
edition, 2008, DMW)

Although [few Americans realized that "assassin" was an Arabic word,
many probably believed that the brutal act of terrorism]{.underline} in
the streets of Cairo, like Black September's bloody raid outside Munich
nine years earlier, [was very much in keeping with the Arab
character.]{.underline} Seven months before the Olympic massacre, a
retired State Department Middle East expert had published a psy-
chological profile warning that the repeated humiliations inflicted by
Israel would unleash a "collective need for vengeance" deeply rooted in
Arab cul- ture. "[It is difficult to describe the depth of the Arabs'
emotional need for re- venge, but suffice it to say that Islam itself
found it necessary to sanction re- venge,"]{.underline} Harold Glidden
observed in February 1972. "The felt need for revenge is as strong today
as it was in pre-Islamic times."116 [Other orientalist broadsides
followed in quick succession]{.underline}. Raphael Patai, an
Israeli-educated anthropologist who had taught Middle Eastern studies at
Princeton, Columbia, and other American universities, offered his
readers a 34 orientalism, american style bleak [view of the
"backwardness, cultural decline, indeed, fossilization" of the Arab
world in 1973.]{.underline} [The troubled relationship with the
West]{.underline}, Patai explained, was the result of everything from
prolonged breast-feeding to faulty toilet training, all of which
"[produced a disturbing inferiority complex in the Arab mind which in
itself made it more difficult to shake off the shackles of stag-
nation."]{.underline}117 Two years later British orientalist John Laffin
informed the Amer- ican public that "violence exists at every level of
Arab life," thanks mainly to "poverty and frustration --- sexual,
economic, \[and\] political." Long ago, Laffin added, "history 'turned
wrong' for the Arabs," leaving them subordinate to the Western powers.
The "consequent trauma," he concluded, was "a principal reason for the
great psychological sickness which fell like a plague upon the Arab
race."118 William Brown, a U.S. diplomat posted to Cairo and Beirut dur-
ing the 1960s, confirmed Patai's and Laffin's orientalist diagnoses in a
1980 retrospective aptly titled *The Last Crusade*. Arab nationalism was
"beyond the control apparatus of any state" and had "a reactive quality
arising from the Arabs' experience with the West," Brown observed. "A
relative and toler- ant perspective is not possible within the Arabs'
world of absolute and God- given truth."119 [Critics such as Edward Said
were quick to challenge these orientalist assump- tions]{.underline}. As
early as 1978 [Said insisted that such pathological stereotypes of the
Arabs constituted little more than self-serving rationalizations for
Western cultural and economic imperialism.]{.underline} ["Lurking behind
all of these images is the menace of jihad,"]{.underline} he observed
bluntly. "Consequence: [a fear that the Muslims (or Arabs) will take
over the world." The net effect of this fear was ignorance]{.underline},
Said concluded in the final chapter of *Orientalism*, [ignorance that
seemed des- tined "to keep the region and its people conceptually
emasculated, reduced to 'attitudes,' 'trends,' statistics: in short,
dehumanized."12]{.underline}0 Throughout the 1980s and into the early
1990s [Said broadened his critique, stressing that America's habit of
viewing "Arabs as basically, irrecusably, and congenitally 'Other'"
clearly reflected "racist overtones in its elaboration of an 'Arab'
anti-democratic, violent, and regressive attitude to the
world."]{.underline} This, Said pointed out in *Cul- ture and
Imperialism* in 1993, "[contributed to the polarity that was set up be-
tween democratic Israel and a homogeneously non-democratic Arab world,
in which the Palestinians, dispossessed and exiled by Israel, came to
represent 'terrorism' and little beyond it."121]{.underline}

### Middle East 

#### The irrational fear of the "Islamic Bomb" is just a carry over from years of Orientalism and Islamophobia

[[The heavily freighted idea of an "Islamic bomb" has been around for
some decades now]{.underline}.]{.mark} The notion behind it is that a
nuclear weapon developed by an "Islamic" nation would automatically
become the Islamic world's shared property -- and more than that[[, a
"nuclear sword" with which to wage jihad]{.mark}.]{.underline} But, as
with many terms applied to the "Islamic world", it says more about
Western attitudes than about why and how nuclear technology has spread.
The concept as we know it emerged from anxieties about proliferation,
globalisation, resurgent Islam, and conspiracies real and imagined, a
fearful idea that could be applied to the atomic ambitions of any Muslim
nation or non-state group. It looked at Pakistan's nuclear programme and
extrapolated it to encompass everything between the mountains of South
Asia and the deserts of North Africa. [[And ever since it appeared it
has retained its power to shock, eliding terrorism, jihadism, the
perceived ambitions of "Islamic" states, and state-private proliferation
networks into one fearsome term]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has also made a
useful avatar for all sorts of specific threats -- Muammar Gaddafi's
anti-Western "fanaticism", Saddam Hussein's socialist Ba'athism, the
Iranian Mullahs' revolutionary Islamic ideology, contemporary
fundamentalist terrorism, and Pakistan's military-Islamic thinking. But
of course, the Islamic bomb idea is part of a web of complex
geopolitical ideas. International terrorism, the rise of modern
political Islam, and Western interventions all muddle the issue. And
oddly enough given the way it's used today, the term in fact began its
life outside the West. High Hopes The connection between religion and
the bomb was in fact first explicitly made in 1970s Pakistan, where
leaders Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Muhammad Zia ul-Haq both saw nuclear
weapons as the means to enhance the country's status within the
so-called "Muslim world". Yet Pakistan's atomic program was at its heart
a nationalistic security project, not a religious one[. [The term
"Islamic bomb" didn't appear in the Western news media until around
1979, when the Iranian Revolution set outsiders worrying about the
potential intersections between nuclear weapons, proliferation and
Islamic politics.]{.mark}]{.underline} At around the same time, India
was mounting a campaign against Pakistan's nuclear ambitions; its
government and media duly began deliberately stoking fears of a
pan-Islamic nuclear threat originating with Islamabad. Israel's
government, too, made it clear that it believed an Islamic bomb was
imminent. Media revelations about Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer
Khan also helped to spur interest. In 1975, Khan had stolen uranium
enrichment centrifuge blueprints from the URENCO plant in the
Netherlands. These ended up providing the technical basis for Pakistan's
bomb programme. Khan's theft -- and the genuine conspiracy that was
Pakistan's international nuclear purchasing project -- led to conspiracy
theories. Despite him being a Pakistani nationalist, the Guardian
newspaper stated that "Dr Khan Stole the Bomb for Islam". His act was
seen not as the actions of one man, but as part of a wider "Islamic"
conspiracy. In 1979, media institutions including West Germany's ZDF,
the UK's BBC, and the US's CBS all popularised the concept. On little
evidence, it became accepted that this was a project designed to benefit
the entire Muslim world. But despite the genuine Pakistani-Libyan
connections, there was simply never a unified Islamic nuclear quest.
Conspiracy Theory Through the 1980s and 1990s, [[countries as diverse
and mutually antagonistic as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger and Pakistan were
all tied together by the Western fear of an Islamic bomb.]{.mark}
Prominent commentators such as Jack Anderson and William Safire
consistently deployed the term[; politicians as diverse as Tam Dalyell,
Edward Kennedy, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan all talked about it in
fearful terms. All were off-base.]{.mark}]{.underline} After Khan's
international proliferation network was exposed in 2004, there duly
appeared a slew of books on the subject, more than a few of which
posited that there was an international "Islamic" conspiracy to acquire
"the bomb". Khan was portrayed as a "nuclear jihadist" bent on righting
perceived wrongs inflicted by the West on the world's Muslims. Again, a
genuine conspiracy became tied up with conspiracy theory. Yes, Khan did
proliferate centrifuge technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea -- but
he was motivated by money, power and prestige, not religion. Today, the
spectre of the Islamic bomb haunts certain corners of the internet. From
the Huffington Post to Breitbart and the Washington Times, the term
crops up again and again, always used to imply that nations such as Iran
harbour ambitious ideological motives for their nuclear ambitions. It's
true that prominent Muslim figures from Bhutto to bin Laden spoke
rhetorically about a "bomb for the ummah". But this was never more than
rhetoric. Leaving aside all nuclear matters, internecine and sectarian
differences and conflict mean that global Islamic political unity is
unlikely in the extreme[. [The Islamic bomb has always been a convenient
device with which to elide complex problems of religion, politics and
nuclear weapons. And sadly, it still is. Those who still casually bandy
the term about would do well to think about where it really comes
from.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Homeland is an edge-of-your-seat sensation," according to the official
website of the show. Homeland, a spy thriller television series
currently renewed for its seventh and eighth seasons starting in 2018,
is broadcasted on the cable channel Showtime. It is based on an Israeli
series titled Prisoner of War, which was acquired by 20th Century Fox
Television and adapted into Homeland for American audiences (Otterson,
2017). The original series was produced by Keshet, an Israeli media
production company, that was brought on as a producer of Homeland as
well. The executive producers are Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon, both of
whom additionally worked on the early 2000s American spy thriller 24, a
show that also featured an American counter-terrorism unit (IMDB) and
themes similar to those of Homeland. Homeland has been at the center of
intense controversy; despite the fact that the show has won two Golden
Globe Awards, as well as multiple Primetime Emmy Awards for Best Drama
Series and Outstanding Lead Actors, it has also garnered harsh criticism
on the basis of its depictions of Arabs and Muslims (IMDB; Edwards,
2017). The show is rated Mature and as such, is clearly geared toward a
slightly older audience; however, despite its mature rating and the fact
that it is aired on a premium cable network, the show has been vastly
popular, consistently garnering viewership in the millions (O'Connell,
2013 ; Otterson, 2017). The series follows brilliant but volatile agent
Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) as she works for the Central Intelligence
Agency in their counter-terrorism unit. At the beginning of the first
season, Sergeant Nicholas Brody, who was presumed dead after being
captured in Iraq eight years prior, is found and returned home. Abu
Nazir, a Palestinian terrorist and al-Qaeda commander who is the show's
main antagonist, held Brody captive. While Brody is heralded as an
American hero, Carrie is not so easily convinced of his intentions; she
had been warned that a US prisoner of war had been radicalized and
suspects Brody is the double agent. The majority of the first and second
seasons focus on Carrie's struggle to determine Sergeant Brody's
intentions. Eventually, the CIA discovers that Tom Walker, another US
prisoner of war presumed to be dead, is alive and had become
radicalized. Although suspicion then shifts towards Walker, it
eventually becomes evident that Brody and Walker had been working
together in plotting a domestic terror attack along with another couple
who had become radicalized, Faisel and Aileen. Brody eventually plans to
assassinate the Vice President of the United States and many of his
staff using an explosive vest; however, he changes his mind at the last
moment. Brody's terrorist inclinations are finally discovered by the CIA
at MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 2 Volume 1 • Issue 1 large and after intense
interrogation and manipulation, they convince him to work with them to
eliminate Abu Nazir. Brody struggles to balance his work as a newly
elected congressman with his role working for the CIA as an undercover
agent in Nazir's in-group. This group includes Roya Hammad, a terrorist
sympathizer and reporter, as well as a local man serving as a
bomb-maker. As more of Abu Nazir's contacts come to light and the
situation becomes increasingly complicated, Carrie and her team struggle
to keep things under control. At the conclusion of season two, Abu Nazir
is captured and killed; however, his death does not stop a bomb from
exploding at a CIA headquarters event, killing over 200. Nazir frames
Brody for the explosion and Brody and Carrie are forced to flee. The
show additionally follows Carrie's challenges as she grapples with
mental illness, Brody's struggles as a convert to Islam, and the
challenges of Brody's wife Jessica and their two children, Dana and
Chris, face as they attempt to adjust to Brody's return and the
consequences of his bizarre behavior. [Themes of American nationalism,
Arab identity, and Islam all prevail in the show. These detailed and
strategic frames reflect larger underlying beliefs about an implied
dichotomy between the global East and global West.]{.underline} My
research question therefore is as follows: how does Homeland represent
Arab Muslim identity and US nationalism in the context of Orientalism as
defined by Said? That is to say, how does Homeland [frame and link Arab
Muslim identity and American nationalism as categories that are
inherently antithetical to one another]{.underline}? [First, the paper
examines previous research conducted on the representation of Arabs and
Muslims in American media, the concept of US nationalism, and how
Orientalism plays a role in American self-concept as well as attitudes
towards the Middle East, and how that overarching framework is
demonstrated in our media content.]{.underline} [Immediately following,
I analyze how Homeland addresses concepts of Orientalism in general, as
well as Arab Muslim identity and US nationalism in particular, and the
sociopolitical relevancy of these representations]{.underline}.
Literature Review Through a long and rich history of textual analysis
and study, it has been established that the media play a vital role in
both forming a framework through which audiences see the world and in
setting the agenda to establish what is or is not important in a current
sociopolitical landscape (McCombs & Shaw, 1972, p. 176). [Media both
informs and is informed by social perception of the world.]{.underline}
Ground-breaking work by [Gerbner in 1976 established his idea of
'cultivation theory,' by which a particular way of seeing the world is
established and internalized through repeated exposure to that
framework]{.underline}. Although cultivation of a framework is only one
of many pieces of audience beliefs, Gerbner's work set an important
precedent for understanding the relationship between media production
and viewership. [Hall's work additionally builds upon this idea by
examining the creation and maintenance of ideologies in media,
particularly racist ideologies]{.underline} (2003). [On inferential
racism, Hall argues that [there are "naturalised representations of
events]{.mark} and situations [relating to race,]{.mark} whether
'factual' or 'fictional'[, which have racist]{.mark} premises and
[propositions inscribed in them as]{.mark} a set of [unquestioned
assumptions]{.mark}"]{.underline} (2003, p. 90). [The naturalization of
certain beliefs and the ways that lines between a set ideology and what
is objectively "true" about the world become blurred must form our
understanding of how racist and Islamophobic ideology is presented in
media. [A]{.mark} [negative]{.mark} [ideological framework has
pervaded]{.mark} media [representation]{.mark} of Islam and the Middle
East.]{.underline} Ahmed and Matthes (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of
media representations of Muslims, examining 345 studies published from
2000-2015. They found that Muslims were overwhelmingly portrayed in a
negative manner, and that furthermore, media [[discourse relied on
Orientalist tropes to frame Muslims as the 'Other]{.mark}.'
S]{.underline}haheen (2003) went back even further, detailing the
lengthy history of representation of Muslims and Arabs in his work by
examining over 900 films from more than a century. He found that
[stereotypes describing Muslims as "heartless, brutal, uncivilized,
religious fanatics" have become pervasive in media through the
years]{.underline} (Shaheen, 2003, p. 171). Alsultany has updated and
expanded this representational work, developing categories for a variety
of stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims, particularly in the overarching
category of what she refers to as "simplified complex representations."
According to Alsultany, simplified complex representations are the
contemporary form of Islamophobic representations, in which it may
appear that Arabs are now presented as having more well-rounded and rich
characterization in media, but beneath the surface, characters are still
trapped in the same reductive storylines revolving around terrorism.
Alsultany claims that "Post-9/11 television is testimony to the fact
that the stereotypes that held sway for much of the twentieth century
are no longer socially acceptable---at least in their most blatant
forms. But this does not mean that such stereotypes (and viewers' taste
for them) have actually gone away; they have only become covert"
(Alsultany, 2012, p. 27-28). Alsultany also did research on the ways in
which nonprofit advertising in MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 3 Volume 1 •
Issue 1 America attempts to sell the idea of a diverse and multicultural
society that is inclusive of Muslim Americans. The issue became
increasingly complicated after September 11th, when national confusion
and fear was heightened. "In addition to government practices that
defined Americans and Arabs/Muslims as binary opposites," Alsultany
wrote, "[[government]{.mark} and media [discourses relied]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} old [Orientalist tropes that positioned American national
identity as democratic,]{.mark} modern[, and free and the Middle East
as]{.mark} primitive, [barbaric, and oppressive]{.mark}"
(]{.underline}2007, p. 594). [Halse (2012) found additional Orientalist
beliefs creeping in to media representation.]{.underline} He examined
the show 24 and discovered a post September 11th shift to a new Muslim
stereotype: the radicalized Muslim in disguise as the average American.
In fact, the show was promoted using the phrase "[They could be next
door." According to Halse, 24, which was produced by the same
individuals as Homeland, builds on the idea of the East and the West as
fundamentally antithetical to one another]{.underline}. Powell (2011)
also examined the framing of Islam and Arab communities in a post
September 11th world. Her research found that media representation
framed "Muslims/Arabs/Islam working together in organized terrorist
cells against a 'Christian America'" (Powell, 2011, p. 91). Her work is
important in addressing the other side of the equation: the development
of an identity for the West that can be presented as antithetical to the
East. It is here that the concept of US nationalism becomes important to
understanding this implied dichotomy. In his book examining the concept
and creation of nationalism, Anderson (1983) defined a nation as "an
imagined political community" in which people find an identity in their
sense of nationalism. This sense of unifying identity forms a "deep
horizontal comradeship" (1983, p. 49 & 50). In a population searching
for meaning, nationalism fills a gap and creates unified meaning.
However, the identity that becomes formulated can have dangerous
implications. In an examination of the paradoxes of nationalism, Pei
(2003) argues that "American nationalism is hidden in plain sight" (p.
34). American is highly nationalistic, yet does not believe itself to
be. Two important aspects that are relevant to this piece can be drawn
from Pei's research. First of all, according to Pei, when examining
statistics about American attitudes, it becomes clear that "Americans
not only take enormous pride in their values but also regard them as
universally applicable" (2003, p. 32). There is a very strong belief in
the superiority of American policies and values, as well as a strong
belief that they could benefit the rest of the world. Yet another aspect
of US nationalism can be directly linked to this---what Pei referred to
as "the willingness of ordinary citizens to contribute to the public
good" (2003, p. 32). [Although military prowess is not discussed in this
piece, it is easy to see how [this confidence in US values]{.mark} [and
a willingness to contribute]{.mark} can [lead to]{.mark} a
[strengthening]{.mark} [of American military
powers.]{.mark}]{.underline} In his work examining American nationalism
in the context of United States foreign policy following September 11th,
McCartney (2004) argues that following the September 11th attacks,
attention was immediately and successfully diverted to the war in Iraq.
He argues that "enduring nationalist themes provided the basic structure
in which Americans organized their comprehension of and reaction to the
terrorist attacks" and that a part of the reason for intervention in the
Middle East was to change the world "to suit American interests by
making it more consistent with American values," which he argues has
always been an aspect of American nationalism (2004, p. 400). The attack
on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center provided a perfect backdrop
to seamlessly connect American nationalism to interference in the Middle
East. [Monten (2005) agrees with McCartney's assessment, arguing that US
nationalism "has historically been defined in terms of both adherence to
a set of liberal, universal political ideals and a perceived obligation
to spread those norms internationally" (p. 113). This attitude
extensively shaped American politics following the events of September
11th. These ideals and beliefs are strongly rooted in the history of
Orientalism.]{.underline} [Edward Said famously coined the term
Orientalism in his 1978 book. Orientalism, which Said defines as "a
style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological
distinction made between 'the Orient' and (most of the time) 'the
Occident'", is vital to defining the relationship between the East and
West (]{.underline}1978, p. 112[). [Orientalism posits the global West
as the antithesis to the East]{.mark}, [setting]{.mark} [up]{.mark} a
dichotomy in which [the East]{.mark} is defined [as inferior]{.mark},
backward, and primitive, while the West is defined as superior, modern,
and progressive.]{.underline} Orientalism arose from a long history of
interaction between the Middle East, France, and Britain, which involved
complex power dynamics and intense conflict. However, [it is important
to note that the East, herein referred to as the Orient, does not
reflect the Middle East; the [Orient is a creation of the West with
little basis]{.mark} in fact. It is this inaccurate and offensive
concept of the East that is posed as the antithesis to the
West.]{.underline} Said's research revolutionized the ways in which
scholars examined the relationship between the global East and West.
Kumar (2010) examined the resurgence of Orientalist concepts during the
second Bush administration. According to Kumar, Orientalist beliefs have
once more become dominant after September 11th. Coverage on major news
MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 4 Volume 1 • Issue 1 sources has led to the
naturalization of an epistemological framework rooted in Orientalist
beliefs and attitudes. She addresses and refutes five of these prominent
Orientalist concepts, including the ideas that Muslims are inherently
irrational/backward as well as the idea that they are innately violent.
She also addresses the "clash of civilizations" theory, coined by Lewis
in the 1950s, which resurged during the Bush administration. This
particular theory posits that conflict in this case is due to inherent
cultural and religious differences between the global East and West.
Asad, in his 2007 book on suicide bombings, addresses this idea, arguing
that the problem with this theory is that it ignores a lengthy history
of interaction between the East and West, and the fact that neither of
these parts of the world developed in isolation. [Asad also addresses
why terrorism and ostensibly legitimate warfare are seen differently,
concluding that the main difference is that killing that is sanctioned
by governments is legitimized]{.underline}. Furthermore, he argues that
[justifications for categorizing something as warfare instead of
terrorism are additionally predicated on the supposed status of the
nation: "it is not cruelty that matters in the distinction between
terrorists and armies at war, still less the threat each poses to entire
ways of life, but their civilization status. [What is]{.mark} really [at
stake]{.mark} [is]{.mark} not a clash of civilization... but [the fight
of civilization against]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [uncivilized]{.mark}"
(2007, 37-8). [This]{.mark} argument neatly [ties]{.mark}
[together]{.mark} [Orientalism, differentiation, and state-level
justifications of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As George W. Bush said
in 2006, "We face an enemy that has an ideology. They believe things.
The best way to describe their ideology is to relate to you the fact
that they think the opposite of what we think." [This idea of the East
as the antithesis]{.mark} of the West is strongly rooted in American
society historically and currently, and [has]{.mark} [become]{.mark} a
[justification for foreign policy]{.mark}, ubiquitous in media
representation.]{.underline} Analysis Orientalism A thorough analysis of
Homeland indicates that it is predicated upon concepts of Orientalism.
The dichotomy of terrorism/counter-terrorism goes deeper than simply an
attack/protect plot line; throughout the series, it is shown that the
true dichotomy is in the way that the Middle East is posited as
antithetical to the West. Characters within the Western hemisphere,
defined by a sense of US nationalism, are held up as the opposite to
everything the Muslim Arab world represents. The inherent, underlying
values and belief systems of each are detailed as completely different
and mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the show depends upon an
ethnocentric depiction of the Middle East. A specific idea of the Orient
is created through a Western gaze, and that idea of the Orient is
posited as the antithesis of the West; the 'real' Middle East is never
relevant. Narratives stemming from the Middle East are completely
ignored in the show, which solely utilizes its particular concept of the
Orient as a counter-argument to the West. [The West is moral, civilized,
and modern, as are its people; the East is inherently immoral, violent,
uncivilized, and completely backward, as are all those who stem from
that area. The only possible way to salvage such a society is through
violence, or rescuing the occasional Arab woman from such a dangerous
place]{.underline}. Nationalist values are furthermore presented as the
moral of the story, inspiring average Americans to take up arms to
defend their homeland. Furthermore, a sense of US exceptionalism comes
into the picture; the West resorts to extreme acts of violence, but only
because they have been "backed into a corner," so to speak, and have no
other choice. In reinforcing this narrative, despite the violence of its
Western characters, Homeland reifies the dichotomy of the moral West
positioned against an immoral East. These aforementioned concepts of
Orientalism are demonstrated through the entire show, particularly in
the way they intersect with Homeland's narratives surrounding Arab
Muslim identity and US nationalism. Arab Muslim Identity One of the most
salient issues in the show is the representation of Arab Muslim
identity. Statistically, Arabs comprise a relatively small percentage of
Muslims worldwide; however, Homeland conflates Arab and Muslim
identities as being indistinguishable. In doing so, they draw from a
long and rich history of stereotyped and statistically inaccurate
representations of Arab Muslim communities (Shaheen, 2003). This
representation has been at the forefront of criticism of Homeland; many
individuals and organizations within the Arab and/or Muslim community
argue the show draws upon offensive, stereotyped, and one dimensional
representations of their people (Alsultany, 2007; Alsultany, 2012). An
analysis of the first two seasons of Homeland suggests that their
concerns have validity. In the first two seasons of the show, without
exception, Arab Muslims are shown to be backward, violent, and
uncivilized. "They yell 'death to America' no matter what we do," Vice
President Walden shouts during season two. Furthermore, Homeland fails
to present even a singular Arab or Muslim character who remains
uninvolved with terrorism. In the opening few minutes of the series, two
different acts of violence are perpetrated by Arab MURAJ •
z.umn.edu/MURAJ 5 Volume 1 • Issue 1 Muslim characters on Western
characters. First, Carrie Mathison is violently dragged from an Iraqi
prison by guards. Despite the fact that she was in the prison illegally,
a stark point about the violence of the Arab world is made when her
white body is dragged kicking and screaming down the filthy hallway of
an Iraqi prison by multiple Arab men dressed in Muslim garb.
Furthermore, Sergeant Brody is shown being tortured and imprisoned by
al-Qaeda. This is demonstrated with visually disturbing images of
brutality, involving beatings and blood. Furthermore, the Arab
characters behaving violently toward Brody go a step further in their
cruelty and brutality, forcing him to beat his fellow captured marine to
the point of unconsciousness. In doing so, Homeland demonstrates that
Arab Muslims not only seek violence against men from the West as a form
of revenge, but enact violence for enjoyment as well. From these initial
moments of the show, there is little improvement. Every single scene
taking place in the Middle East includes senseless violence on the part
of Arab Muslim characters. Additional stereotypes include excessively
wealthy characters, Arab men sexually possessing white women to the
point of total control, abusive Arab husbands, violently rioting Arabs,
a multitude of terrorist characters, and even more terrorist-sympathetic
characters. Even Arab Muslims within the US are under suspicion by the
federal government, solely for being Arab and Muslim, invoking the
'insidious Muslim' stereotype. It soon becomes clear that a journalist
named Roya Hammad is a terrorist sympathizer, despite having a high
profile career, being college educated, and working at the White House.
A man named Faisel who was a college professor and husband buying his
first house turns out to be a terrorist working on a plot to enact a
domestic attack. Faisel and his wife even use the symbol of an American
flag as an indicator that their safety is compromised; this drives home
the point that although these Arab Muslims may look and act like
Americans, and even own these symbols of overt patriotism, they are not
one of us---they are secretly plotting the downfall of the West. Even
working for the CIA, as Arabic-speaking and Muslim character Danny
Galvez does, is not enough; when Carrie Mathison suspects there is a
mole at the CIA, he is the first to be investigated, solely because he
is Muslim. Additional comments about Muslims being "Qu'ran thumpers" and
coming from "nomadic cultures," as well as Muslim greetings (peace be
upon you) and the Muslim statement of faith (there is no god but God and
Muhammad is His prophet) are uttered solely in situations of terrorism
and violence, clearly framing Arab Muslims as overly religious, backward
and uncivilized, and inherently violent. As an additional point of
interest, Arabic spoken by Arab characters is rarely translated on the
show; Arabic spoken by white characters is translated. This difference
further positions Arab Muslims in a position as Other, as if their
native language is something inherently suspicious. Furthermore, the
show conflates of the entire Middle East regarding countries, names, and
organizations. Barriers and distinctions are blurred to create a
singular homologous, homogenized entity. The setting of the show
consistently switches between Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Pakistan
without clear reason; furthermore, it presents all of the countries as
roughly the same. They are all inaccurately presented as speaking Arabic
and lacking basic modern resources such as grocery stores, electricity,
and coffee shops. One episode set in Lebanon sparked outrage for
depicting the country inaccurately (BBC News). Carrie Mathison flees
through the streets of what is supposedly Hamra Street in Beirut,
running through decrepit and filthy buildings and down unpaved roads.
She has changed her eye color and covered her hair, supposedly to blend
in. In reality, Hamra Street is a flourishing economic hub for Beirut,
drawing large groups of tourists year-round. It is a well-developed
area, including clothing stores, street festivals, and even Starbucks.
Furthermore, Hamra Street is filled with ex-pats who would not give a
blonde haired, blue eyed, uncovered woman a second glance. However, in
order to reinforce the concept of the Orient as uncivilized and
backward, Homeland chose to frame Beirut as a place filled with violence
and a complete lack of real culture or modern amenities. Furthermore,
the long history of cultural interchange between the East and West is
completely glossed over. These regions are presented as historically and
currently completely separate. Another notable issue reflects the naming
of characters. Abu Nazir's son, Issa, is repeatedly invoked as the
reason for Brody's radicalization; however, his name is never pronounced
correctly. Additionally, Roya Hammad, former refugee, White House
reporter, and terrorist sympathizer, is supposedly Palestinian, but has
a Persian name. Terrorist organizations are also conflated and mixed up.
Abu Nazir is an al-Qaeda leader; however, at the beginning of season
two, he is supposedly working with a Hezbollah commander. Although there
have been isolated incidents of cooperation, in general, al-Qaeda and
Hezbollah are at war with one another despite sharing the common enemy
of the West. All of these may seem like smaller issues in the grander
scheme of the show; however, they are indicative of a larger underlying
issue at play. The Arab world is filled with a variety of distinctive,
unique, beautiful cultures. However, none of this rich and meaningful
historical and MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 6 Volume 1 • Issue 1 cultural
context is relevant for the purposes of Homeland. As Said said, [[the
Orient]{.mark}, after all[, is]{.mark} not an actual depiction of the
Middle East, but instead [an artificial creation by the
West]{.mark}.]{.underline} Homeland demonstrates this clearly. Accuracy
and distinctions regarding the complexity of the Muslim world are
absent---rather, to service the purposes of the show, the entirety of
the Middle East is conflated to create a reductive depiction of a
diverse portion of the world and simply present an impoverished and
homogenous hotbed for terrorism instead. Additionally, Arab Muslim
bodies are depicted as disposable and treated as less than human. When
it is revealed that the CIA knowingly killed over 80 Arab children, the
entire situation is treated as more of a PR catastrophe than a
humanitarian crisis. During a raid, the CIA further kills several
individuals who were praying at a Washington DC mosque; little sympathy
is shown in this situation and it is simply framed as another PR
disaster and another situation where a terrorist slipped away. Afsal
Hamid, a captured terrorist, kills himself while in CIA captivity after
someone slips him a razor blade; his storyline is subsequently dropped
and what happened in that scenario is never revealed. After Faisel is
killed by the CIA, Aileen negotiates a Muslim burial for him, but there
is no follow-up. Even in the first episode, an Arab man who was a
terrorist that supposedly had information on a radicalized prisoner of
war is allowed to be executed by his country in the name of avoiding an
international conflict. Brody kills an Arab bomb maker in the middle of
the woods and the murder is dropped after one episode; what exactly
happened to him post-mortem is never clarified, nor does the audience
ever receive any background information on him. It is simply posed as a
kink in the plans for detonating a bomb. In situation after situation,
Arab Muslim bodies are treated as replaceable and worth less than their
white counterparts. When they are featured in storylines, their
characterizations are brief and one dimensional with no follow-up, and
more often than not, there are no storylines in the first place. Arab
Muslim lives are treated as expendable, interchangeable, and secondary,
there only to enact violence and then be removed from the plot line. US
Nationalism US nationalism forms a main thread of Homeland; the main
goal of the CIA counter-terrorism unit throughout seasons one and two is
to protect the United States from an imminent attack. Even the title of
the show indicates this fierce protectiveness of American soil and an
obligation to not only commit to fighting terrorism abroad, but also
domestically. However, the way that US nationalism as a concept is
created and reinforced in the show points to a variety of beliefs about
identity that are rooted in Orientalism. From the very first episode of
the show, the need for an "American hero" is emphasized. The opening
sequence sets the scene for the imminent danger of an attack on American
soil; images of an innocent child playing are juxtaposed with explosions
and audio visual clips of past US presidents speaking about terrorism.
"We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad", intones Obama
in an edited press conference clip. Furthermore, in a voiceover, Saul
Berenson, a CIA agent, says that "It was 10 years ago; everyone missed
something that day" in a clear reference to September 11th, considering
the first season of Homeland aired 10 years after the attacks on the
Twin Towers. Carrie Mathison says that she "can't let that happen
again." From the first minutes of the series, a clear precedent is set
and is reinforced in each episode: America is in danger. Because of this
looming threat, violence enacted by Americans is framed as justified.
Early on, it is clarified that the military has no desire to be in
Afghanistan, but "the terrorists are still out there, for blood"
according to the CIA and as such, America has no choice but to engage in
violence. War and violence are clearly posed as undesirable, but are
seen as an unavoidable necessity in the face of violence from the Arab
world. Even a situation in which the CIA knowingly bombed and killed
over 80 children is seen as justifiable; very few characters are
depicted as being upset about it because those in power are presented as
having had no other choice. The lives of those Arab children are posed
as being a worthy sacrifice for American safety and peace of mind.
Protecting the nation comes above all and can justify any act. In this
case, the dividing factor is the depicted value set behind each group;
whereas the Muslim Arabs are written as ruthless fanatics who enjoy
violence and use it with impunity, American forces are written as being
driven by moral concerns and only resorting to violence when they are
backed into a corner. US exceptionalism is rife throughout the show.
Anything the US does is acceptable; Middle Eastern countries, however,
are never afforded the same luxury or opportunity to defend themselves.
In fact, while interrogating and manipulating Sergeant Brody, Carrie
Mathison reassures him, saying "that's the Brody that knows the
difference between warfare and terrorism." [[The implication is
clear]{.mark}; [the violence of American]{.mark} [forces]{.mark} [is a
legitimate military tactic, while the actions of Arab countries is
simply fanatical and unreasonable violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Enter
Sergeant Brody and his perfect nuclear MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 7 Volume
1 • Issue 1 American family. They're hardworking, white, Christian, and
moral. Brody and his wife Jessica were high school sweethearts; she
worked two jobs in high school and he struggled for his education as
well. They later married, had two children, and he joined the armed
forces. They attend church and pray before meals. Furthermore, upon
returning home, Brody is an American hero and is immediately forced to
the forefront of every major news source, depicted as a returning
American patriot. Brody is not inherently violent, but he is willing to
do anything to protect America and make sacrifices for the larger goal
of the nation. Jessica, his wife, was in a long term relationship with
another man prior to his return; however, upon her husband coming home,
she immediately recommits to him and to their original marriage vows.
They pose for the cameras and interviews, showing off their perfect
American lives. When he converts to Islam and his wife finds out, the
ensuing conflict clearly demonstrates the identity conflict. "I married
a US Marine," she yells at one point and the connotation is clear; being
a US Marine and a Muslim are mutually incompatible. She goes on to
describe how his conversion would shame the whole family and they would
need to "hide their faces," further emphasizing this incompatibility.
The implication is clear: American is not Muslim and Muslims are not
American. With the exception of occasional cameos by the family members
of other characters, no other family besides the Brody family is
regularly depicted in Homeland; for the purposes of the show to be
served, they only need this singular family. The Brody family
encapsulates all the qualities of a picturesque American family. Their
situation, down to every last detail, includes all the building blocks
for US nationalism. They're white, they're Christian, they're educated,
and they're committed to the causes of the United States military
forces. Furthermore, when one of them steps out of line and tarnishes
the all-American family picture, their incompatibility with US
nationalism is emphasized. Homeland draws clear lines to indicate what
is an identity rooted in American nationalism and what is not. However,
as the show progresses, it becomes clear that their family is beyond
fractured. Brody is an undercover terrorist who is struggling with the
mission assigned to him by Abu Nazir; his marriage with Jessica is
distant and filled with discord; and their daughter is rebelling.
However, even as their picture-perfect family disintegrates, the show is
still very clear that they are not like those quantified by Homeland as
the Other. Brody, despite working with terrorist leader Abu Nazir and
planning to kill the Vice President via suicide vest, is still seen as
reachable and is consistently humanized. He is continually given second
chances and explanations are offered for his behavior. His nuclear
family relationships are repeatedly invoked to humanize him. He backs
out of committing his suicide vest attack after an emotional call from
his daughter. Later, Carrie reminds him that Abu Nazir "kills Danas and
Chrises and Jessicas," once more invoking his family members. He is
painted as a troubled man who is put in a difficult position but is
ultimately saved by his commitment to his family. In this way, despite
his blatantly terroristic actions---murder, tipping off a terrorist
leader to an American-led attack, and almost setting off a suicide vest
amongst others---the show puts a clear divide between him and the 'real
terrorists.' He is neither heartless not an inherently cruel individual;
he is an American corrupted by the heartless and cruel Arabs. In
contrast, Abu Nazir's son was killed by American forces when he was only
a child; however, Nazir's connection to family is never invoked to
humanize him or fill out his character. Family connection as a
humanizing aspect and understandable motivation for behavior is reserved
for characters from the global West. Another example of the way in which
white terrorists are still positioned as distinct from the Other can be
seen in the example of Faisel and Aileen. Faisel, a college professor
and terrorist, moves into a house near the airport with his white wife
Aileen at the beginning of season one. When the CIA discovers they are
terrorists, they immediately shoot and kill Faisel, while Aileen
escapes. When the CIA finally catches up to her, she is personally
driven back to headquarters in a car, while a CIA agent attempts to make
conversation with her. The agent additionally takes her out for dinner
and to visit his childhood town. Ultimately, through conversation, it is
determined that she met Faisel while living in Saudi Arabia. The agent
suggests that she never would have become radicalized had she not
"fallen in love with a boy." Her behavior is excused, justified, and
humanized in a way that the behavior of the Arab Muslim characters are
not. Even though she is a confessed terrorist who was planning on
carrying out an attack on American soil, she is still presented as
separate from the 'real' terrorists. Conclusion In conclusion, Homeland
is a continuation of many of the representations of Arab Muslim
communities and US nationalism we have seen before. Homeland can be
considered to simply present updated versions of the same stereotypes
and tropes of the past. "If 24 was the quintessential television drama
of the war's early phase--- with its ticking-time-bomb scenarios
glorifying torture, its MURAJ • z.umn.edu/MURAJ 8 Volume 1 • Issue 1
glorifying torture, its mass killings of US civilians by weapons of mass
destruction, and its constant stream of one-dimensional terrorist
enemies---Homeland is hailed as a liberal alternative, more appropriate
to the Obama era," writes Kundnani (2014). Alsultany's simplified
complex representations play out again and again in the show's
storylines; although it may appear that audiences are getting more
complex and culturally accurate representation, in reality, the
characterization boils down to the same one-dimensional representations.
Furthermore, these representations draw upon Orientalist tropes,
presenting the East as a negative inversion of the West. The Arab world
is shown as a simplified and primitive place filled with violent
religious fanaticism; Arab Muslims are seen as cunning, devious, and
terroristic, present only to antagonize the Western characters before
being disposed of. In contrast, the West is filled with ethical and
progressive characters fighting to protect their homeland, clear
products of a sense of US nationalism and identity. Although the
storyline becomes increasingly convoluted as the show progresses, every
character can still be boiled down to fall into one of these two
categories, both of which are based in Orientalism. [Media play a large
role in informing audience beliefs and attitudes. Viewers draw from
media to develop their beliefs about what is or is not important and
what is or is not true. In our current sociopolitical
climate,]{.underline} what viewers believe is or is not important and
true about America's foreign relationships and our country's Arab Muslim
citizens could not possibly be more important. In our past election
cycle, attitudes on Islam became a dividing factor between the two
candidates and their respective political parties. Shows like Homeland
may draw from real life events and issues, but they also simultaneously
produce and reinforce beliefs in their audiences. When we present one
dimensional, reductive characterizations of Arab Muslims, we do a
disservice to millions; furthermore, when we define US nationalism as
simply the antithesis to the Middle East, we create a singular and
exclusive sense of what it means to be American. Furthermore,
[[Orientalism creates real consequences regarding how America behaves in
the Middle East]{.mark}. Until we can move into representations that
allow for ethnorelative thinking and truly complex characterization,
storytelling narratives will continue to intentionally or
unintentionally produce the stereotypes and frameworks that have been
identified as being present in our media for over a
century.]{.underline} Orientalism is outdated, offensive, and
inaccurate, and we need to do better.

[Few parts of the world have become as deeply embedded in the U.S.
popular imagination as the Middle East]{.underline}. The Puritans who
founded "God's American Israel" on Massachusetts Bay nearly four
centuries ago brought with them a passionate fascination with the Holy
Land and a profound ambivalence about the "infidels"--- mostly Muslims
but some Jews --- who lived there. Raised on Bible stories and religious
parables laced liberally with a fervently Christian sense of mission and
a fiercely American Spirit of '76, the citizens of one of the New
World's newest nations have long embraced a romanticized and stereo-
typic vision of some of the Old World's oldest civilizations. The
missionaries, tourists, and merchants who sailed from America into the
Eastern Mediter- ranean during the nineteenth century were amazed by the
Christian relics and biblical landscapes but appalled by the despotic
governments and decadent so- cieties that they encountered from
Constantinople to Cairo. [The diplomats, oil men, and soldiers who
promoted and protected U.S. interests in the Middle East during the
twentieth century converted these earlier cultural assump- tions and
racial stereotypes into an irresistible intellectual shorthand for han-
dling the "backward" Muslims and the "headstrong" Jews whose objectives
frequently clashed with America's.]{.underline} That intellectual
shorthand, reflected in everything from feature films and best-selling
novels to political cartoons and popular magazines, has had a pro- found
impact on Main Street and in the nation's capital. Over the years [the
public and policymakers in the United States have frequently
employed]{.underline} what historian Michael Hunt has termed [a
"hierarchy of race" in dealing with what used to be called the Third
World.]{.underline} As early as 1900, Hunt argues, [Anglo- Saxon racism
and Social Darwinism had fused in the collective mind of Amer- ica to
generate a powerful mental map in which]{.underline}, predictably, [the
"civilized" powers---the United States and Western Europe---controlled a
descending array of underdeveloped, even "primitive" Asians, Latinos,
American Indians, and Africans.]{.underline} Although Hunt discusses the
Middle East only in passing, his brief references suggest that [U.S.
policymakers tended to place Arabs and Jews nearer the bottom than the
top of the hierarchy of race]{.underline}.1 More than a decade ago
Columbia University's Edward [Said suggested]{.underline} why this
should have been so. Borrowing from intellectual history, literary
criti- cism, and classical philology, Said showed how eighteenth-century
British o[fficials embraced "orientalism," a self-serving view of
Asians, Africans, and Arabs as decadent, alien, and
inferior,]{.underline} a view that Whitehall later used to ra- tionalize
its own imperial ambitions from the Indian subcontinent to the banks of
the Nile. For British orientalists, Ottoman despotism, Islamic
obscurantism, and Arab racial inferiority had combined to produce a
backward culture that was badly in need of Anglo-Saxon tutelage. With
the waning of Britain's power and the waxing of America's after 1945,
something very [like Said's oriental- ism seems subconsciously to have
shaped U.S. popular attitudes and foreign policies toward the Middle
East.]{.underline}2 More recently anthropologists Catherine Lutz and
Jane Collins have sug- gested how orientalism made its way into U.S.
popular culture. Utilizing in- sights from postmodern social theory,
photojournalism, and cultural anthro- pology, Lutz and Collins trace the
process through which [orientalist images of the Middle East and other
parts of the Third World were generated and dis- seminated by one of the
most widely circulated magazines in the United States]{.underline},
National Geographic. The subliminal messages encoded in the magazine's
eye- catching photos and intriguing human interest stories seem clear.
The Arabs, Africans, and Asians who grace the pages of National
Geographic are back- ward, exotic, and occasionally dangerous folk who
have needed and will con- 10 orientalism, american style tinue to need
U.S. help and guidance if they are successfully to undergo polit- ical
and cultural modernization.3 Once [the orientalist mindset of imperial
Britain insinuated its way into the White House, the Pentagon, and Foggy
Bottom]{.underline} during the late 1940s, and once the orientalist
worldview epitomized by National Geographic found its way onto America's
coffee tables and movie screens during the early 1950s, [U.S. policies
and attitudes toward the Middle East were shaped in predictable ways.
Influenced by potent racial and cultural stereotypes,]{.underline} some
imported and some homegrown, [that depicted the Muslim world as decadent
and inferior, U.S. policymakers]{.underline} from Harry Truman through
George Bush [tended to dismiss Arab aspirations for self-determination
as politically primitive, economically suspect, and ideologically
absurd]{.underline}. Meanwhile, Zionist pioneers were ineluct- ably
transforming the dream of a Jewish state into Middle Eastern reality
through blood, sweat, and tears. Both the dream and the reality soon
prompted most Americans to shed their residual anti-Semitism and to
regard the chil- dren of Isaac, now safely more Western than oriental,
as a strategic asset in America's increasingly nasty confrontation with
the children of Ishmael. As the twentieth century drew to a close,
Hollywood confirmed that orien- talism American style had sunk deep
roots into U.S. popular culture. In 1992 Disney Studios released
Aladdin, the latest in a long line of animated classics, which opens
with a Saddam Hussein look-alike crooning "Arabian Nights." The lyrics
evoke long-standing sinister images of the Muslim world punctu- ated by
an orientalist punch line: "It's barbaric, but hey it's home." Two hun-
dred years earlier, Americans familiar with the Middle East would not
have disagreed.

#### The Middle East and Muslim world is constantly characterized as the orient that Us policy makers perpetuate the orientalist conception

In short, as [the Truman administration drew to a close, officials from
the bottom to the top of the policymaking pyramid were convinced that
the peo- ples of the Muslim world were an unpredictable lot whose
penchant for polit- ical and religious extremism constituted a grave
threat to U.S. interests in the region]{.underline}. Indeed, [most U.S.
policymakers would likely have seconded the orien- talist
assessment]{.underline} that Britain's ambassador to Iraq forwarded to
London in late 1952. The Iraqi, like most Arabs, "is embittered,
frustrated and fanatical," Sir John Troutbeck cabled Whitehall on 31
October. "Seeing little but squalor and stagnation around him, he will
not admit even to himself the obvious answer, that he belongs to a
peculiarly irresponsible and feckless race."75 [The man who replaced
Harry Truman in the Oval Office in January 1953 was equally comfortable
with such orientalist stereotypes of the Middle East]{.underline}.
Dwight [Eisenhower's view of the Muslim world was colored by his wartime
experiences in North Afri]{.underline}ca, where a decade earlier he had
tried unsuccess- fully to bridge the gap between French colonialists and
Algerian nationalists. "Arabs are a very uncertain quantity, explosive
and full of prejudices," he re- marked privately in November 1942. "Many
things done here that look queer are just to keep the Arabs from blazing
up into revolt."76 [Eisenhower's close encounter with the Arabs during
the 1950s did nothing to soften his earlier assessment.]{.underline}
Despite Britain's "modern program of independence for countries once
part of the Empire," Ike complained in his memoirs, Egyptian president
Gamal Abdel Nasser had unleashed a crusade of "virulent nationalism and
un- reasoning prejudice" in which there was "evidence of Communist
meddling."77 [Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal during the summer of
1956 reinforced Eisenhower's belief that the Arabs were irrational,
resentful, and dangerous to Western interests. "]{.underline}Nasser,"
Ike observed on 31 July, "[embodies the emotional demands of the people
of the area for independence and for 'slapping the White Man
down]{.underline}.'"78 When Eisenhower sent U.S. marines to Lebanon two
years later to shore up a pro-American regime besieged by pro-Nasser
dissidents, he reminded the National Security Council (nsc) that "the
underlying Arab thinking" remained deeply rooted in "violence, emotion
and ignorance."79 As his term drew to a close, Ike complained that
Nasser and like-minded nation- alists were little more than oriental
despots. "[If you go and live with these Arabs, you will find that they
simply cannot understand our ideas of freedom or human
dignity,"]{.underline} he told the nsc in June 1959. "[They have lived
so long orientalism, american style 27]{.underline} under dictatorships
of one form or another, how can we expect them to run successfully a
free government?"80 Eisenhower's top advisers echoed the president's
growing frustration with the Arabs. Shortly after taking over at Foggy
Bottom, for example, John Fos- ter Dulles took a two-week fact-finding
trip to the Middle East that confirmed all of his Presbyterian fears of
the Muslim infidel. Following visits to Cairo and other Arab capitals in
May 1953, Eisenhower's secretary of state pronounced Nasser and
like-minded Arab nationalists "pathological" in their suspicion of the
Western powers and "naive" in their trust of the Kremlin.81 It is no
sur- prise that in private conversations with U.K. officials in early
July, Dulles de- scribed Iran's anti-Western prime minister, Mohammed
Mossadegh, as "a wily oriental."82 When anti-Western violence rocked
Baghdad, Beirut, and Amman five summers later, White House
troubleshooter Robert Murphy un- dertook a "twenty-nine-day Magic Carpet
tour of the fabled East" at the be- hest of Eisenhower, with whom he had
worked to curb "the restiveness of the indigenes" in Muslim North Africa
during the Second World War. After vis- iting "Godforsaken stretches of
Iraq," where "mobs whose violence surpassed all expectations" held sway,
he informed his boss in August 1958 that little had changed since the
early 1940s.83 [U.S. diplomats stationed in the Middle East helped
reinforce the orientalist views of Eisenhower, Dulles, and
Murphy]{.underline}. When Ambassador Henry Villard found himself mired
down in endless negotiations over a U.S. air base in June 1954, he
cabled Washington that the tactics of Libyan officials were "tanta-
mount to blackmail and show\[ed\] little change from \[the\] barbary
pirate tra- dition."84 Two years later Henry Byroade, the U.S.
ambassador to Egypt, con- firmed that Nasser and his followers were
volatile, unpredictable, and quixotic. "Arabs are quite capable of
getting completely beside themselves" on matters related to Israel,
Byroade warned Dulles on 14 March 1956, "because by na- ture they
\[are\] inclined to fight windmills."85 A White House study completed
four years later reiterated the importance of "psychological" factors in
U.S. rela- tions with the Middle East. American officials, the drafters
of nsc-6011 pointed out in July 1960, must understand that ["the Arabs'
experience with and fear of Western domination" had generated hostility
and suspicion that were in turn exacerbated by "their belief that the
United States is the special friend and protector of
Israel."]{.underline}86

Noam Chomsky (1982) has suggested that t[he arms race between the super-
powers was not really \"about\" the U.S.-Soviet rivalry at all but was a
conven- ient way to assure the subjugation of smaller countries in the
Third World under the guise of superpower competition.]{.underline} One
does not have to swallow whole simple reductionism of this argument to
accept that [there is obvious connection between the nuclear stockpiles
of some developed nation hand and the political client ship and economic
underdevelopment World nations on the other]{.underline}. Just as [some
nations have abundant a while others do not, so some nations are allowed
plentiful supplies of the ultimate weapon while others are prevented by
elaborate treaties an police activities from obtaining it]{.underline}.
Without devising rigidly deter els connecting economic power and nuclear
weapons-models th as Japan and Germany obviously would not fit-one can
at lea broad contours of this generalization: the nuclear underdevelopm
veloping world is one fragment in a wider and systematic pat
disempowerment that ensures the subordination of the south.\'9 [The
discourse on nuclear proliferation legitimates this system of domination
while presenting the interests the established nuclear powers obtaining
their nuclear monopoly as if they were equally beneficial to all the
nations of the globe]{.underline}. And, ironically, the discourse on
nonproliferation these subordinate nations as the principal source of
danger in the another case of blaming the victim. [The discourse on
nuclear proliferation is structured around a rigid segregation of
\"their\" problems from \"ours]{.underline}.\" In fact, however, we are
link ing nations by a world system, and many of the problems that, w
these nations ineligible to own nuclear weapons have a lot to do w and
the system it dominates. For example, the regional conflict and Pakistan
is, in part at least, a direct consequence of the divide cies adopted by
the British raj; and the dispute over Kashmir, id Western commentators
as a possible flash point for nuclear war, h not so much in ancient
hatreds as in Britain\'s decision in 1846 to install a Hindu maharajah
as leader of a Muslim territory (Burns 1998). [The hostility between
Arabs and Israelis has been exacerbated by]{.underline} British, French,
and [American inter- vention in the Middle East dating back to the
Balfour Declaration of 1917]{.underline}. More recently, as Steven Green
points out, \"Congress has voted over \$36.5 billion in economic and
military aid to Israel, including rockets, planes, and other technol-
ogy which has directly advanced Israel\'s nuclear weapons capabilities[.
It is pre- cisely this nuclear arsenal, which the U.S. Congress has been
so instrumental in building up, that is driving the Arab state to attain
countervailing strategic weap- ons of various kinds\"
(1990).]{.underline}

Americanizing the Middle East [The Middle East began to loom larger on
America's diplomatic and cultural horizon]{.underline} during what Mark
Twain called "the Gilded Age," [not only because U.S. missionaries
sought to save more souls but also because U.S. merchants sought to
expand trade]{.underline}. By the 1870s American entrepreneurs were
buying nearly one-half of Turkey's opium crop for resale in China while
providing the Ottoman Empire with everything from warships to kerosene.
"Even the sacred lamps over the Prophet's tomb at Mecca," one U.S.
diplomat gloated in 1879, "are fed with oil from Pennsylvania."19
Meanwhile a new generation of American missionaries made their way to
Armenia, Syria, and other corners of the Ottoman realm, spreading not
only the gospel but also subversive New World ideas. Indeed, by the
1890s two in- stitutions of higher learning established by U.S.
missionaries three decades earlier ---Robert College just outside
Constantinople and the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut --- had
become notorious anti-Turkish hotbeds, where Arabs, Kurds, and Armenians
began to dream of and scheme for national independ- ence.20 "Quite
without intention," British orientalist and adventurer T. E. Lawrence
observed a generation later, these two colleges had actually "taught
revolution" to subject peoples throughout the Turkish empire.21 While
most U.S. observers seem to have agreed that the Christians of Ar- menia
and Syria might profit enormously from these lessons, few churchmen or
diplomats expected such revolutionary teachings to spell anything but
dis- aster in the Muslim world. When angry mobs of Iranian students and
peas- ants toppled the royal government and forced the shah to proclaim
a consti- tutional monarchy in August 1906, for example, Ambassador
Richmond Pearson offered a bleak forecast laced with orientalism:
"History does not re- cord a single instance of successful
constitutional government in a country where the Mussulman religion is
the state religion."22 Ambassador John Leish- man, Pearson's counterpart
in Constantinople, was no more sanguine about the prospects for
constitutional rule in Turkey, where reformist military officers ---"the
Young Turks"--- staged a coup and curbed the sultan's powers in July
1908. "The fanatical element" among Muslim students, soldiers, and
mullahs, Leishman reported nine months later, had triggered
antigovernment riots, an army mutiny, and "a reign of terror and a
succession of murders."23 [President Theodore Roosevelt,]{.underline}
who had appointed both Pearson and Leish- man, [was even more skeptical
about the possibility of reform and progress in the Middle East. A firm
believer in a hierarchy of race in which "civilized na-]{.underline} 14
orientalism, american style [tions" like the United States must shoulder
"the White Man's Burden" and at- tempt to westernize the "benighted"
peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer- ica,]{.underline} [Roosevelt
confessed]{.underline} privately in 1907 that ["it is impossible to
expect moral, intellectual and material well-being where Mohammedanism
is su- preme]{.underline}." The Egyptians, for example, were "a people
of Moslem fellahin who have never in all time exercised any
self-government whatever." Britain's Lord Cromer, Roosevelt added, "is
one of the greatest modern colonial administra- tors, and he has handled
Egypt just according to Egypt's needs"--- military oc- cupation, foreign
tutelage, and Christian patience.24 **[If Roosevelt ranked Muslims near
the bottom of his hierarchy of race, he placed Jews closer to the
top]{.underline}**. To be sure, like many other members of the pa-
trician elite that still ruled America at the turn of the century[,
**Roosevelt har- bored some patronizingly offensive stereotypes of
Jewish Americans.**]{.underline}25 But he was also highly critical of
the wave of anti-Semitism that swept Turkey and Russia during the First
World War, and he was an early supporter of the idea of establishing a
Jewish state in the Holy Land. The United States and its al- lies,
Roosevelt observed in July 1918, should "pledge themselves never to make
peace until the Turk is driven from Europe, and . . . the Jews \[are\]
given control of Palestine." It seemed, he added two months later,
"entirely proper to start a Zionist State around Jerusalem."26 [As the
war to end all wars drew to a close, the establishment of a Jewish
homeland in Palestine had become a goal widely shared on both sides of
the Atlantic]{.underline}. Famous mainly for its biblical ruins and its
fruit exports, Palestine had until very recently remained little more
than a sleepy backwater con- trolled by the dying Ottoman Empire.
Overwhelmingly Muslim, Palestine had counted just 25,000 Jews among a
total population of 300,000 as late as 1880.27 Fifteen years later,
however, Theodore Herzl, a thirty-five-year-old Jewish
lawyer-turned-journalist born in Budapest, published what might be
called the first Zionist manifesto. [Outraged by the pogroms in Russia
and Poland and appalled by the resurgence of anti-Semitism]{.underline}
farther west in France, [Herzl warned]{.underline} his brethren in the
pages of *The Jewish State* that [only by es- tablishing a national home
in Palestine could they be safe from persecution.]{.underline} Working
tirelessly, Herzl brought together Jews from seventeen countries, in-

As [enthusiasm for a Jewish state in Palestine faded at the White House
and at Whitehall]{.underline} during the 1920s, an upsurge of nativism
eroded support on Main Street for the Zionist dream. From Atlanta to
Anaheim the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses and staged rallies to intimidate
African Americans, Cath- olics, and Jews, while on the banks of the
Potomac Congress was erecting re- strictive quotas to stem the flow of
Jews and other "undesirable" groups from Eastern Europe. [Fearful that a
Zionist success in Palestine might inadvertently call into question the
loyalty of the entire Jewish community in the United States, influential
American Jews]{.underline} such as *New York Times* publisher Arthur
Hays Sulzberger [distanced themselves from lobbying efforts on Capitol
Hill.]{.underline} By the early 1930s [membership in the Zionist
Organization of America, an orientalism, american style]{.underline} 19
[umbrella agency]{.underline} founded by Brandeis and Wise a generation
earlier, had plum- meted from a postwar high of 175,000 to just 25,000,
convincing the State De- partment's elitist and sometimes anti-Semitic
Middle Eastern experts that they could safely ignore this first Jewish
foray into interest group politics.44 By late 1936 [the State
Department's Wallace Murray had convinced his supe- riors to do nothing
that might "entangle us in any other way in the most del- icate problem
of Palestine]{.underline}."45 Murray's brief for [U.S. noninvolvement
could not have come at a worse time for American Zionists or their
comrades in Europe]{.underline}. Claiming that [the influx of 250,000
European Jews during the decade and a half since the First World War was
more than the overloaded Palestinian economic and political system could
bear]{.underline}, in 1936 [the Arabs launched a violent revolt to
resist Zion- ism.]{.underline} While Palestinian militias battled the
Haganah, the Jewish underground army, in the streets of Jerusalem and
the foothills of Nablus, even more omi- nous events were unfolding in
Germany, where Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic policies were growing ever
more blatant. Since coming to power in early 1933 the Nazi dictator had
tarred German Jews with the brush of communism, stripped them of their
civil rights, and branded them scapegoats for the Third Reich's economic
woes. After Nazi tanks rolled into Vienna in March 1938 and after
Hitler's storm troopers went on an anti-Semitic rampage in Berlin eight
months later, thousands of German and Austrian Jews sought refuge
abroad, some in Britain and America, but most in Palestine.46 [At the
time when European Jewry was most desperate for a safe haven in a
national homeland,]{.underline} however, [the British government moved
to reduce Jewish immigration to Palestine sharply.]{.underline} Having
just completed a costly two-year campaign to suppress the Arab revolt,
Whitehall issued a White Paper on 17 May 1939 limiting the total number
of Jewish refugees permitted to enter the Holy Land to just 75,000
during the next five years; after that, all further im- migration would
be subject to Palestinian approval. Among the most outspo- ken critics
of the 1939 White Paper was fifty-three-year-old David Ben Gu- rion, the
charismatic unofficial leader of the Yishuv, as the 350,000-member
Jewish community in Palestine was now known. Convinced that persuading
Whitehall to rescind the White Paper would prove an exercise in
futility, Ben Gurion and his comrades hoped American Zionists might be
more successful at the White House, where [Franklin D. Roosevelt was
preparing to seek an unprecedented third term with support from Jewish
liberals]{.underline}.47 Long sympathetic to the aims of the Balfour
Declaration, fdr was clearly troubled during the late 1930s by signs
that Britain intended to repudiate its commitment to a Jewish homeland.
"I was at Versailles," he recalled in 1938, "and I know that the British
made no secret of the fact that they promised Palestine to the Jews. Why
are they now reneging on their promise?"48 Bri- 20 orientalism, american
style tain's actions during the spring of 1939 only raised more
questions. "I have read with interest and a good deal of dismay the
decisions of the British Gov- ernment regarding its Palestine policy,"
he told Secretary of State Cordell Hull in mid-May. "This White Paper,"
Roosevelt hastened to add, "is something that we cannot give approval
to."49 During the following eighteen months well-connected Zionists such
as Stephen Wise and Felix Frankfurter, whom fdr had recently tapped to
fill Brandeis's seat on the Supreme Court, quietly encouraged the
president to press Whitehall to honor its commitments re- garding
Palestine. At the State Department, however, Hull and his advisers in-
sisted that U.S. meddling would only serve to undermine the U.K.
position in the Middle East at a time when Britain, in the wake of the
fall of France in June 1940, was the sole remaining barrier to complete
Nazi domination of Eu- rope. Judging geopolitical considerations to be
more important than domestic politics, Roosevelt kept his doubts about
the White Paper to himself and still managed to win a third term by a
healthy margin.50 Thousands of European Jews unable to find refuge
abroad would soon be among the earliest victims of the Holocaust. During
1939 and 1940 the Nazis had targeted the Jewish population of occupied
Europe for relocation to con- centration camps in Poland. After the
German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, agents of the Gestapo,
Hitler's secret police, began systematically to murder all Russian Jews
who fell into their hands. By the time that Ger- many's Japanese allies
attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, rumors of the Gestapo's
anti-Semitic butchery were already filtering into the United States. In
January 1942 Hitler formally approved a "final solution for the Jewish
problem" and authorized the Schutzstaffel, or SS, an elite corps of the
German army whose commanders spoke with the voice of Cain, to begin the
wholesale extermination of hundreds of thousands of Jews then imprisoned
at Ausch- witz, Buchenwald, and other concentration camps. During the
next three years nearly 6 million Jewish men, women, and children would
die.51 The unspeakable slaughter unfolding in Nazi-occupied Europe
removed any remaining doubts among most American Jews about the
importance of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In May 1942, 600 American
Zionists gathered at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City and passed a
unanimous resolution de- manding "that Palestine be established as a
Jewish Commonwealth integrated in the structure of the new democratic
world." While insiders such as Stephen Wise sought to win White House
support for the Biltmore declaration, out- siders like Abba Hillel
Silver, a fiery Cleveland rabbi born in Lithuania and ed- ucated at
Hebrew Union College, founded the American Zionist Emergency Council,
whose 200 local chapters funneled a half-million dollars into national
headquarters to finance a lobbying effort in Washington.52 [Nineteen
forty-four was an election year, and U.S. advocates of a Jewish

to gain bipartisan endorsements for their plans.]{.underline}

Introduction In the trying times of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict,
it is natural to expect that Ukraine will seek support from more
powerful partners. However, the reaction of international partners to
the conflict is increasingly unenthusiastic, despite most recent
aggravations in the Azov Sea. A growing awareness of the so-called
'Ukrainian fatigue' among international partners invites Ukrainian
decision- and policy-makers, as well as general public, to reflect on
Ukraine's own resources, self- support and self-reliance. Alongside the
necessity to find an optimal course of development, these issues have
become increasingly important as the conflict shows no end. One of the
arguments surfacing in this debate is that the East-West division within
Ukraine may become internalized and impact the relations within the
country, in the present and in the future. As such, analysis of images
and narratives on East vs. West within Ukraine may assist in informing
and fine-tuning a dialogue in the country and help to seek out
compromises and roadmaps for reintegration of the occupied territories.
This analysis also asks if the notions of East and West influence how
Ukraine sees its neighbours and the wider world. [The ultimate aim of
this paper is to identify the imaginary geography of Ukraine and trace
Ukraine's place on the mental map of the world within the coordinates
from East to West and in the context of the ongoing
conflict]{.underline}. This 'mental mapping' is argued to be
instrumental in understanding images of external Others as well as
images of Self. The data are collected from the interviews of Ukrainian
elites -- decision-, policy- and opinion- makers -- representing
different policy fields including media, culture, politics, civil
society and business. The semi-structured interviews with Ukrainian
elites, conducted face-to-face by pretrained researchers, were held in
2016-17 as a part of the Jean Monnet Network "Crisis, Conflict and
Critical Diplomacy: EU Perceptions in Ukraine, Israel and Palestine" (C
3EU) led by the National Centre for Research of Europe, University of
Canterbury (Christchurch, New Zealand) in cooperation with nine
international partners (https://jeanmonnet.nz/c3eu/, see also Chaban and
Zhabotynska 2018 in this Issue). In the analysis provided below, the
respective references are \"Media\", \"Culture\", \"Civil\", and
\"Business\" followed by a number of the interview, as it is registered
in the C 3EU data; for example, Civil5. The questionnaires for the
interviews focused on the perceptions of the EU in the context of
conflict and crisis in Ukraine. The interviews were conducted in
Ukrainian and Russian with responses transcribed verbatim and later
translated into English. This paper uses quotations from the English
version as a purely linguistic approach is not the goal in this case
study. Due to Human Ethics regulations, all responses will remain fully
anonymous, and only the cohort will be identified when the words are
quoted. [While the questionnaire did not explicitly ask about "East vs.
West" images, the interviewees often referenced and compared East
vis-à-vis West, typically in order to highlight the differences between
Ukraine and other actors. Following this empirical observation, this
article sets to trace if there was a clear placement of Ukraine in these
"mental mappings". Where exactly is Ukraine's place on the imaginary map
of the world? Can the opposition "East vs. West" be explained by the
influential theory of orientalism]{.underline} \[Said, 1978\]? [The
theory hypothesizes a negative connotation assigned by the West to the
East.]{.underline} The article respectively explores if the narrative of
unconquerable discrepancies between Ukraine's East and West regions
exist in the imagination of the Ukrainian movers and shakers. The
article also aims to map the imaginary geography in terms of "East-West"
divide outside the country's borders. 94 The theoretical framework
section describes the theories behind the research, sets the focus of
studying Ukraine's vision of East, West and self. Said's orientalism and
Huntington's clash of civilizations hypotheses inform the theoretical
framework of this study. The analysis is also guided by a set of
concepts developed by the scholars of Eastern Europe -- Wolff \[1994\],
Pittaway \[2003\], and Todorova \[2009\] among others -- in highlighting
the similarities and differences in the images of East vs. West in
neighbouring countries. These theorisations are instrumental to explain
the perceptions among Ukrainian elites (traced through the data
collected from the interviews and discussed in detail in the Findings
section). [The images are categorized into two main frames of "outside
Ukraine" and "inside Ukraine" with several sub-categories -- a
conceptual architecture that explicates an elaborate and complex mental
mapping of the world by Ukrainian policy- and
decision-makers.]{.underline} The Conclusions section outlines how the
tested theories were partially disproved, showing that [the East is not
necessarily weak or exotic in Ukraine's elite perceptions, and that the
East vs. West opposition within the country's borders is not
internalized by the interviewed stakeholders]{.underline}. 2.
Theoretical frameworks According to the theory articulated by Edward
Said in his book Orientalism \[1978\], [the pattern of dissecting the
world into East and West has been present since the ancient times. One
of the most influential works on the imaginary geography of the
post-colonial world]{.underline}, Said's analysis had become the
trend-setter[. It invited a generation of scholars to launch into
further investigation how the East is perceived by the West and vice
versa. Receiving a fair share of criticism for its historical
inaccuracies and author's personal bias, Orientalism nevertheless
sparked an ongoing discussion]{.underline} that has only grown since the
first edition of the book. This article is informed by Said's theory of
'strong West vs. weak East' \-- as the result of inaccurate cultural
representations. In his work, he claims [that Orient not only was
constructed by the West but also "has helped to define Europe (or the
West) as its contrasting image, idea, personality,
experience"]{.underline} \[Said, 1978: 13\]. He also suggests that for
centuries [the Orient has been "a place of romance, exotic beings,
haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences]{.underline}"
\[Said, 1978: 2\]. Using Ukraine's experience, this paper explores how
these claims have stood against time and the effects of globalization,
if their viability has suffered over the last four decades. Referencing
a later work by Huntington \-- the much debated Clash of Civilizations
\[1993\] \-- [Ukraine may be described as one of the 'cleft countries'
\[Huntington, 1993: 30\]. On the one hand, it belongs to the so-called
Orthodox civilization.]{.underline} On the other, it has a large number
of people who are identifying with a different, neighbouring
civilization. [In Ukraine's case, the "other" civilisation may be
located in the Western regions of the country that are predominately
Eastern Rite Catholic or Ukrainian Greek Catholic]{.underline}. It is
also possible to speculate whether Ukraine is a Huntington's 'torn'
country, i.e. a country that has made a drastic turn to change its
civilizational path. Huntington \[Huntington, 2013: 44\] outlines three
requirements for a country to redefine its civilizational identity in a
major way: support of its own political and economic elites, approval of
the public, and acceptance of the elites of the given civilization that
a country is striving to join. So far, it is not clear if conflicted
Ukraine can fully become a 'torn' country in Huntington's sense, with EU
membership not being on the agenda and without a transparent response on
that matter from the West. However, Ukraine's Association Agreement with
the EU may be seen as a sign of at least a beginning of the
acknowledgement of Ukraine as a country that belongs with the Western
civilization. The image of the West and the Self in Ukraine have been
scrutinized by scholars prior to Maidan and the following conflict
\[Gritsay & Nikolko, 2009; Tarasenko, & Ivanenko, 2004; Yavorska &
Bogomolov 2010\]. These works reported the emergence of the narrative of
the 'desired yet distant' Europe and the importance of this narrative in
the formulation of the national identity narrative in Ukraine. For
Ukraine, Europe has been a desired and seemingly unreachable 95
destination for a long time, the perfect example to follow \[Yavorska &
Bogomolov, 2010: 86\]. The image of Europe is mythological and mostly
blended into the image of the West in general \[Gritsay & Nikolko, 2009:
176\]. Following the dramatic events on Maidan in 2013-14 and the later
conflict in the East and annexation of Crimea, literature in the field
debates the reasons underlying the Ukrainian crisis \[Black et al.,
2016; Merry et al., 2016\]. While some researchers imply outside
influence, including Russian propaganda, as one of the main causes
\[Kolstø & Blakkisrud, 2018\], others point out to internal origins of
the problem. Importantly, the latter group of scholars often cites
crucial cultural and historical differences between Eastern and Western
regions in Ukraine \[see e.g. Besier & Stokłosa, 2017\]. This article
questions whether there is ground to these assumptions and tests them
empirically. In this, the article innovatively adds to the discussion on
Ukraine's self-visions and identity in the post-Maidan period. Studying
the perceived differences between East and West is by no means a novelty
among historians, sociologists, economists, etc. Attempts to define
borders within Europe and debating their existence brings a new
perspective on putting Ukraine on this "philosophical map". Norman
Davies has set the precedent in the historical studies of shifting the
focus from the predominantly Western-centered view of the European
history and drawing more attention to the role of the Eastern and
Central European countries in shaping the modern Europe \[Davies,
2006\]. He claims that the so-called East Europe is an inherent part of
the Western civilization and should not be seen as subordinate. Mark
Pittaway on the other hand goes even further, suggesting that both the
internal and external borders of Europe are fluid \[Pittaway, 2003\] and
cannot be defined. He also states that the "former socialist states are
both part of outside Europe" \[Pittaway, 2003: 156\], which includes
Ukraine as a region that previously was on the other side of the "iron
curtain". Using evidence from maps, travellers' memoirs and works of
literature Wolff [argues that the imaginary division between Eastern and
Western Europe has been present since the Enlightenment and still
determines not only the perception of the East as the "other" but the
image of self in eastern countries]{.underline}. \[Wolff, 1994; 16\].
The complex and diverse Balkan region especially has been the focus of
several studies in the context of new countries joining the EU
\[Bideleux & Jeffries, 1998; Petrovic, 2014; Todorova, 2009\].
[Ukraine's case, however, may bring an even more profound insight into
the matter of these perceived divisions]{.underline}, especially at such
a turbulent period of fighting the Russian aggression and striving to
find support from its European partners, when finding its own place and
stance is vital. 3. Findings Among the first observations is that the
imagined geographical positioning of Ukraine in general seems to be very
often identified vis-à-vis Russia. This place on the map of the world is
seen to be problematic, as it means for Ukraine difficulties in avoiding
conflict in the present and securing a peaceful future. A media
professional comments, "Ukraine has such a geographical position that
places it between the EU and Russia, ... a very powerful country, both
on the economic and political levels..." (Media7). This geographical
position is seen by some to be a trap for Ukraine: 'You cannot escape
Russia, of course. We are just surrounded' (Civil5), or '...we cannot
get rid of geography, that is why Russia is important for us' (Civil9).
Yet, some see Ukraine on the move away from the East: 'We announced the
\[European\] vector, we are leaving. We are still Europeans in our
mentality and can not belong to the eastern regions, that want to
swallow us, to return us' (Civil2). Others believe that being a country
on the edge of two civilizations may be actually advantageous for
Ukraine and the West. This presents Ukraine with an opportunity to play
an important role on the international arena. One cultural elite
compared Ukraine to a "stumbling block on the way of the eastern and
southern and northern hordes" (Culture1). Another representative of the
cultural circle stated: 96 Ukrainians are the "resource" for the EU as a
civilized, cultural and educated workforce, especially for Eastern
Europe - for Poland and Czech Republic. The thing is that Ukrainians
have moved to Italy, France, Spain and Portugal earlier and this
migration wave is at present moving towards Poland, Czech Republic, a
bit less to Hungary. But still nobody denies the logistic importance of
Ukraine (Culture7). Perceptions of the notions "East" and "West" among
the interviewed elites may be grouped into two main categories: 'outside
Ukraine' and 'inside Ukraine'. 3.1. Perceptions of the East: Outside
perspective If we consider the "outside Ukraine" perspective, the
imaginary geography of East vs. West does not necessarily correspond to
the real world mapping conventions, where Europe and Asia are divided by
the Ural Mountains. Instead, geopolitical and cultural issues guide the
construction of the perceived borders in the imagination of our
respondents. Ukraine's struggle in general is "the issue of us quitting
to be part of Asia and moving to Europe" (Media2). The 'East' outside
Ukraine has its own subdivisions in the eyes of Ukrainian elites:
'Asia', 'Russia', 'Eastern Europe' and 'Eastern Partnership' with the
latter not a geographical, but a socio- political concept that is rather
visible in the interviews. The notion of 'Asia' of the 'outside East' is
comprised in the imagination of Ukrainian policy- and decision-makers of
China, Japan and Turkey, while other Asian actors are largely invisible
(e.g. "Eastern countries, we'll name China, and perhaps even others -
Japan and the like" (Civil2); "I would say, East - I mean Japan, China
and Singapore" (Politics6)). The three visible actors are seen as
rapidly developing countries that may potentially offer an alternative
pattern of progress if Ukraine's struggle to be accepted in Europe, or
more generally 'the West', fails. A civil society representative, for
example, argues that instead of relations with the EU, he would rather
be talking about some closer relations with Turkey" (Civil4). A
politician echoes, "Turkey is just one of the major players in the Black
Sea region. \...It is clear that, maybe we need to establish or attempt
to establish relations with China, because China is becoming a serious
player..." (Politics3). Russia is seen as one of the key representatives
of the 'outside East'. It is often described as one of the great powers,
an influential actor in the region along with the EU and the US:
("\[\...\] other serious subjects which are the USA, Russia" (Media1)).
Unsurprisingly, its image is ambiguous \-- it is both an enemy and a
former significant partner. As one media elite argues 'From the state
policy perspective, they \[Russia\] are our enemies, but from the
people's perspective... we have a million of relatives there, here and
there, and they cannot be our enemies." (Media3). Despite these
connections, the path is seen to be changing for Ukraine: "previously,
we tried to follow ... how it should be in Russia. At present, we try to
follow the West." (Culture9). Another actor in the mental space of the
'East' is 'Eastern Europe'. The interviewees often mentioned Eastern
Europe as an important partner for Ukraine. It is typically represented
by Poland and the three Baltic states. Consider a rather typical
response by a civil society representative: "\[They\] are our partners
on borders with Eastern Europe: it is Poland, the Baltic States, and
partly Romania" (Civil9). These states are seen to have historical and
cultural ties to Ukraine but at the same time belong to the 'outside
West' represented by the EU. However, Eastern Europe is seen in a
position not dissimilar to Ukraine - they belong to the West, but are
not fully accepted there as its rightful members. This is despite having
their status of EU member states. Moreover, this region is sometimes
seen to be excluded from the very definition of Europe: "The reference
of the notion \"Europe\" in most of its usage does not include the
Eastern Europe, many parts. And \[certainly\] not Ukraine" (Civil5).
East European countries are also viewed as advocate for Uk 97 be on
their own, not always abiding by the EU rules. In this case the
placement of these countries on the imaginary map is particular -
regions located to Ukraine's West are placed in the East and not just by
the name, but by cultural proximity. Although the name itself is also
seen as an issue. Business respondent comments, "I am very happy that
they \[young EU MSs like Poland and the Baltic States\] are already
named not "Eastern Europe", but "Northern Europe" \-- what they actually
are" (Business5). Importantly, Ukraine is seen within the circle of the
actors of "Eastern Europe". On the one hand, Ukraine's people are now a
part of the societies in Eastern Europe: "Ukrainians are the "resource"
for EU as a civilized, cultural and educated workforce, especially for
Eastern Europe - for Poland and Czech Republic" (Culture7). On the other
hand, Ukraine is an equal partner to Eastern European countries when it
comes to security and defence matters: "\[Ukraine is\] in the military
block of Eastern European countries, and, as a matter of fact, there is
also an exchange of experience there. It is like a 'micro NATO', let's
call it that" (Business8). Another 'inverted' perspective surfaced in
the imagining the 'Eastern Partnership'. It was discussed in the
interviews as a tool that is supposed to bring Ukraine closer to the
West, but at the same time puts it among the countries that are not yet
accepted by the EU as verified partners. The Eastern Partnership in fact
is seen as not facilitating the relations with the EU, but making them
vaguer and unclear. It is even implied that the very reason for its
creation was "that its member countries could never be accepted to the
EU (Media7)". On the whole, 'Eastern Partnership' along with 'Eastern
Europe' is seen to create a connection with the West: "the EU also had
deep enough relationship with Ukraine within this Neighbourhood Policy,
in the Eastern Partnership framework so it would not be acceptable for
them to leave this game completely, well, to ignore the problem"
(Civil4). Importantly, the EU's Eastern Partnership is seen as policy
that is designed to make its member "not members, but close friends,
close partners" (Politics7) and Europe continues to "co- work with
countries, organizations, with institutions ... in other countries of
Eastern Partnership" (Civil9). Yet, some respondents are less
enthusiastic about the policy: "what is to be done with the East
Partnership countries...(with) these six countries...\[is\] absolutely
unclear" (Politics4). 3.2. Imagining East: Perspectives inside Ukraine
Now, we are turning in our analysis to images of the space "inside
Ukraine". Naturally, war-torn Eastern Ukraine has a high profile in the
discussions about the Ukrainian crisis and the EU's involvement in the
peacemaking process. One of the important observations here was that
naming the conflict was problematic in itself for a number of
interviewees. Some disagreed strongly with the usage of the term
'conflict': "Overall role of the EU in the war of Russia against
Ukraine - and not a conflict! - Requires increased pressure on Russia
and the rejection of double standards of the EU itself" (Culture2).
Other descriptors were 'what we have now going on in the East' (Civil2),
'the events', 'problems' (Politics3), 'the war' (Media6), 'attacks of
Russia' (Culture8), 'warfare or outbreaks' (Politics6). The situation in
Ukraine's East is frequently mentioned alongside another geographical
indicator -- the Crimea, or just South in general. Ambiguity of Russia's
image reminds how Huntignton used Ukraine-Russia conflict of 1991 over
Crimea as an example of tensions within the same civilization: "Such
conflicts, however, are likely to be less intense and less likely to
expand than conflicts between civilizations. \...If civilization is what
counts, however, the likelihood of violence between Ukrainians and
Russians should be low. They are two Slavic, primarily Orthodox peoples
who have had close relationships with each other for centuries"
\[Huntington, 1993: 38\]. For some of the interviewees Russia is still a
part of the same civilization as Ukraine, but current situation shows,
that the conflict is not de-escalating, which may indicate that Ukraine
is almost forced to become a "torn country" through this conflict. To
sum up, none of the perceptions of the East, inside and outside of the
country, appear to support Said's orientalism theory. Apart from the
perception of "Eastern Partnership", that is seen as ambiguous and
sometimes negative, the rest of the images contradict the negative
"othering" of the East. Still, Ukraine is a part of the Eastern
Partnership which makes it a self-image to a degree. 98 3.3. Perceptions
of West: Imagining "Outside West" Diverse responses were observed when
interviewees reflected on the concept of West. The West is general is
frequently named as an important actor in the region. Yet, it is not
seen as infallible and omnipotent. In the eyes of the elite respondents,
it lacks integrity when it comes to dealing with external problems.
Similarly to the notions of East, the perceptions of the West belong to
two general groups: views of the 'Outside West' and 'Western Ukraine'.
The former notion has turned out to be a much more complicated and
diverse one. With the interviews designed to investigate the image of EU
in Ukraine, the 'outside West' is seen to be comprised of the EU (often
represented as "Europe" or separate EU countries, such as Germany and
France), the USA, and sometimes NATO. The notion of the West, however,
is typically associated with the USA, and only then with Europe: "the
so-called West, metaphorical one, because we are talking about the EU
and about America and Canada \[\...\] The West is primarily America."
(Civil4). Importantly, the West is seen to possess "its own values which
it tries to disseminate in Ukraine" (Civil 9). One of the most typical
visions of the 'outside West' was the one of an example for Ukraine to
follow. The interviewees also felt that Ukrainians are supposed to
belong to the Western society, but are not accepted by it yet because of
the current state of events, and internal issues with corruption and
slow reform implementation process. The 'move' towards the West is
recognised in a paradoxical way -- it is both inevitable yet seemingly
fruitless at the same time. The West is believed to be not ready for
Ukraine's bureaucracy, poverty and territorial disputes. Nevertheless,
many elites do not see other alternatives to Ukraine's orientation
towards the West: That is a lot of things are inherent in Western
civilization, which unfortunately we do not have, that either they were
not here or they were destroyed in totalitarian conditions \[\...\] It
is becoming more and more attractive to all those territories to want to
return, so that they would fought to return. Just like East Germans
fought for a return to West Germany. And I do not see and do not want it
any other way (Civil4) Being an important actor, a supporter of Ukraine,
the West is not seen to be willing to exert much power to help it or
maintain its own interests nonetheless. Still, the interviewees
understand the complexity of the situation and do not accuse the EU or
the US -- as the main representatives of the imagined West -- of being
neglectful. Still, there is a sentiment shared among elites that the
West is not using sanctions or other measures against Russia to the full
extent because that would disadvantage the West. These statements are
often accompanied by reflections on the necessity of self-reliance and
self-dependence, etc. Typical examples of such responses are below:
\...the West could have achieved much more than with military force,
because it is a tremendous economic power, and it could certainly \...
find arguments both for Russia and China in order to persuade them to
accept some compromise. \...the West has so many powerful cards that
could be used, but for various reasons they are not ... used (Civil4) At
the same time, the West does not intervene, does not violate the
sovereignty of the Russian Federation, but very significantly restricts
its economic, political, and diplomatic abilities, because they
(Russians) violate human rights. So the West remains holding the
position, and the world, the civilized world remains holding the
position that human rights are above all (Civil9) 3.4. Perceptions of
West: Internal Perspectives Considering the "internal to Ukraine"
interpretation of the "West", Western Ukraine is seen as a link between
the country and the 'outside West', as well as a region that responds to
the European influences more eagerly: "The western region, Western
Ukraine is more responsive to the European 99 Union" (Culture1). This is
the region which is seen to be well linked with the 'Eastern European'
part of Europe: "in Western Ukraine a certain image of Poland has
already been formed, and the relations are clear there, they,
nevertheless, began to understand that the same things should be done in
the east of Ukraine" (Culture4). Western Ukraine is not mentioned as
often as the East of Ukraine, which can be explained by the general
context of the interviews that had specific questions about the
conflict. It is mentioned only occasionally, either as a contrast to the
East, or in a completely unrelated setting. A political interviewee
argues, "we have a pro-European population, it mainly resides in Western
and Central Ukraine, and certainly there are people who live under the
pressure of Russian propaganda and that more are on the eastern Ukraine"
(Politics7). Since the focus of the interviews was on the conflict in
the East of Ukraine, it is understandable that Western Ukraine was
mentioned less frequently. Still, the interviews materials point to a
particular framing of this regions of Ukraine. Unlike the East, it
appears to be closer to Europe not only geographically, but in terms of
common history. The region is seen to become a basis for cooperation and
more involvement than with the countries of Central and Western Europe.
Some researchers of Ukrainian crisis point out to the discrepancies
between its Western and Eastern regions as one of the underlying causes
of the conflict \[Black et al. 2016; Hahn 2017; Olchawa 2017\]. Other
speculate that it has been an issue even before the Orange Revolution of
2004 \[Portnov2013: 241\]. Comparing the perceptions of East vs. West
within the country in the responses of interviews in our case does not
support this premise. Only one of fifty interviewees, who also happens
to be from the East of Ukraine, insisted on 'Westerners' being the ones
to blame for the conflict in Donbass and justified the separatists'
actions with deeply rooted cultural differences: "many \[in Eastern
Ukraine\] wanted federalization precisely for this reason, because they
understood that this is a foreign culture for us, strange values for us,
and that once they came to power by armed means, for us it was
unacceptable" (Business1), at the same time rejecting Western values
decisively: "I do not see a single value that we should have adapted and
would be useful for us, not one." (Business1). This point of view is not
shared by other respondents. Moreover, some are rather sarcastic about
these sorts of opinion: for some parts of society, particularly under
the influence of Russian propaganda, it can also have a different
interpretation, namely that 'that darned EU, darned West started the
fire, we used to live so well, peacefully, amicably, had a loving
relationship with Russia and suddenly here they spoiled it all'
(Civil4). Regarding the image of the West in all of its variety,
empirical findings seem to suggest that Ukraine is indeed a "cleft
country", yet not a "torn country", as described by Huntigton. Without a
clear approval from the imagined "outside West" in form of EU membership
or substantial and decisive support in the conflict with Russia, Ukraine
does not seem to be able to overcome the perceived limitations imposed
by imaginary borders. At the same time, the vision of the West, embodied
mostly by the EU, partially goes in line with Said's "strong West"
narrative. Nevertheless, the image of "strong Asia", discussed earlier
in this paper, makes the orientalism hypothesis inconclusive. 4.
Conclusions This study traced the images of the East vs. West emerging
in the interviews with Ukrainian elites about the image of the EU in the
context of the ongoing conflict and crisis in Ukraine. Importantly, the
questionnaire did not ask specific questions about the 'imagined
geography' of Ukraine, and future studies may choose to focus on this
research objective exclusively. This article presents an initial attempt
to outline the mental map of the world along the East/West divisions in
the eyes of Ukrainian people (in this case Ukrainian decision- and
policy-makers). It is necessary to stress out 100 that both the notions
of East and West are imaginary and their relations are complex and
sometimes perplexing. The results can be grouped into two levels:
"external frames" and "internal frames". The "external frame" includes
the notions of "East" represented by Asia, Russia, Eastern Europe and
Eastern Partnership. The image of Asia has a definitively positive
connotation and this finding contradicts Said's orientalism hypothesis.
In addition, Russia -- a country to the East of Ukraine \-- has an
ambiguous image, albeit with an inclination to negativity. This finding
does not fully correspond to the image of the exotic and demonised
"Other", proposed by Said. The notion of "Eastern Europe", on the other
hand has mostly positive connotations and is, to an extent, a part of
Ukraine's self-image. The image of "Eastern Partnership" supports Said's
theory, featuring negative associations attached to the notion of the
East. These are also partially a component of Ukraine's self-image. The
image of the "Outside West" is complex and does in part resonate with
Said's concept of the 'strong West', however from Ukraine's perspective,
the strength remains unrealized due to lack of stern action in dealing
with the conflict. The "internal frame" includes two main images - "East
of Ukraine", heavily associated with the conflict in the country, and
"Western Ukraine", seen being closer to Europe not just in a
geographical manner. None of these notions is described either as better
or worse, or stronger or weaker. While their images are contrasted to a
minor extent, they are not seen as rivals or competitors. The basic
contours of the 'imaginary map' of Ukraine traced through the responses
of Ukrainian elites partially dismiss Said's orientalism maxim of 'West
is strong; East is weak'. In the eyes of the Ukrainian respondents,
countries in the Far East were seen as models of economic growth and
development in contrast to Europe's slow but noticeable decline.
Moreover, they were seen as a source of alternative models for Ukraine
to follow, in case its European orientation does not work out. The
interviews were conducted during the period when the visa liberalisation
regime for Ukraine had not been implemented yet. At that time, no-visas
regime was believed to be unobtainable due to poor fulfilment of reforms
on Ukraine's side and reluctance on the EU's side. The controversy
surrounding the visa-free issue was viewed in the context of Ukraine's
relations with the EU, and more generally with the West. Indeed, it had
a symbolic meaning of transcending the borders and getting closer to the
West, or rather getting away from the East, and from being the 'no man's
land' between the two sides. From the elites' point of view, the country
is not yet a 'torn' country in Huntington's sense, as it lacks the
approval and acceptance from the symbolic West \-- the EU continues to
deny EU membership for Ukraine. But it is indeed seen as a 'cleft'
country with the growing ties to the West, that are spreading further
into Ukraine's East. The world in the East-West coordinates is not
multipolar, but is stretched between two opposing, equally distant
epicenters of power, namely the US and China. There is very little
visibility to the notions of Center, North or South. These were hardly
mentioned in the interviews, and if mentioned then exclusively in the
"outside frame". Notably, Russia seems to have "moved" to the East since
the beginning of the conflict: previously it often used to be referred
as "the Northern neighbour" of Ukraine, but the interviewees seem to be
inclined to associate it with the East (partially supporting Said's
theory). Notably, Ukraine is not the only country that is seen having a
marginal status. Countries of Eastern Europe were seen to belong to the
same group. While being Western in the definition by geography
textbooks, they are not seen to be fully accepted by the West as an
intimate part of it. Further research is needed for the perceptions of
the imaginary geography of several most mentioned countries, such as
Poland, Russia, China and the USA. They had a high visibility in the
interviews even though they were not the main focus of them. The
fluidity of Europe's 'imaginary borders' provides an opportunity for
Ukraine to overcome the perceived differences and to use the historical
and cultural ties as an advantage in building new 101 and more
far-reaching connections with the EU. Both the current conflict in the
East and common history with many Eastern and Central European countries
create a potential for fostering even closer mutual relations. However,
there is a danger of crossing even those imaginary lines and creating
unnecessary tensions, which is more that possible if there are no
palpable guidelines. Perhaps the most important conclusion is that the
data gathered in the interviews demonstrated that the East-West
dichotomy is not fully internalized in Ukraine. Despite some historical
discrepancies, in the eyes of Ukrainian elites there is no innate
perceived opposition between Eastern and Western regions of the country.
This finding is of critical importance to Ukraine. Considering limited
external influences, a peaceful dialogue within Ukraine is possible
through accentuating common ideals and values.

#### Orientalism is a process by which Western societies construct 'Eastern' cultures as backward and primitive - Ukraine as the backward 'Other' is associated with Russian politics

Abstract: During the 2013 Ukrainian Euromaidan uprising and in its
aftermath, many politicians, journalists, as well as academics diagnosed
the Ukraine Crisis to be a manifestation of middle-class aspirations for
a total social, political, and economic integration with the EU.
Although correct in part, this account overlooks the heterogeneity of
the Euromaidan participants and the role played by radical right and
nationalist groups. [This paper examines the problematic coalition
between liberalism and the radical right factions in the Euromaidan
protests in Ukraine]{.underline}. More specifically, [it suggests the
liberal project that is taking place in Ukraine depends on a specific
form of the friend-enemy distinction of 'New Orientalism']{.underline}.
By doing so, this paper presents a reading of Euromaidan through Carl
Schmitt's critique of liberalism. The discussion concludes with
suggesting a political economy analysis of separatism in the Donbass
region. Key words: Euromaidan; Ukraine crisis; liberalism; liberal
democracy; far right; Donbass; new orientalism; Carl Schmitt; political
economy Introduction The ongoing Ukraine crisis raises political issues
that we thought were long buried in history. The post-communist state
model is on trial once again. During the 2013 Ukrainian Euromaidan
uprising and in its aftermath, many politicians, journalists, as well as
academics2 diagnosed the Ukraine Crisis to be a manifestation of
middle-class aspirations for a total social, political and economic
integration with the European Union (EU). In a way, the story being told
is of the completion of the bourgeois revolution that started in 1991 in
the midst of the Soviet Union breakdown and was carried through with the
2004 Orange Revolution. This popular narrative follows the basic
trajectory of the modernization theory: capitalism leads to democracy.3
Many academics and commentators claimed that with the end of the Cold
War era and its competing worldviews, the spread of liberal democracy
would create political homogenization and eliminate social conflict.4
The current Ukraine Crisis appears to be an example of the latter,
transitioning Ukraine into a truly European liberal democratic and
capitalist society. However, without much theoretical and historical
analysis, the terms 'capitalism', 'democracy', 'liberalism' and
'nationalism' have been employed 1 Olena Lyubchenko is a doctoral

No. 1 46 interchangeably over the past two years, and the struggle for
'liberal democracy' continues to be framed as the 'Ukrainian nationalist
project'. The task of this paper is to demystify and complicate the
mainstream narrative of Euromaidan as an organic democratic development.
In the context of the Ukraine Crisis, the notion of 'democracy' was used
rather vaguely. It tended to be associated with the notions of 'freedom'
and 'equality' of the 'Ukrainian people'; however, none of these terms
was properly defined. This paper intends to interrogate the assumed
unproblematic convergence between the social forces of liberal
democracy5 and those of radical nationalism in the strife for Ukraine's
inclusion into the EU. I suggest that the alliance between the
proEuropean liberal forces and the radical right was enabled by the
definition of a common enemy --- the external, as well as internal,
Russian hegemony. [The European homogenization process involves (1) an
ideological distancing from Russia and (2) a declaration of an internal
enemy, via defining a section of Ukraine's society as backward people.
This has materialized in the ongoing civil war.6 Following Carl
Schmitt's critique of liberalism in The Concept of the Political
(1976),]{.underline} [i.e. that liberalism merely appears to nullify the
friend-enemy distinction,]{.underline} I argue that [the political has
emerged in Ukraine. The current liberal project in Ukraine relies on a
specific form of the friend-enemy distinction, namely that of 'New
Orientalism': a relational construction of 'transnational bourgeois
identity', counterposed to an internal 'Oriental Other'.]{.underline} In
this struggle, Ukrainian nationhood has been defined politically and
economically as essentially 'European' and liberal-democratic; whereas,
the 'Other', the Donbass separatists in the Eastern-most regions, have
been defined in negative terms, as distinctly Russian, Soviet, Asiatic,
backward, corrupt, and, ultimately, Oriental. The focus of this paper is
one-sided because my motivation is to deconstruct what has gained global
currency as a popular example of grassroots democracy by problematizing
the 'democracy' and the far right's seemingly comfortable participation
in its development. I am interested in discursive, ideological, but also
starkly material use of Euromaidan and so attempt to highlight the
ultimate contradictions that it is premised upon. Thus, this paper
covers a lot of ground -- from theories of democratization and
transitions from authoritarianism, to critiques of liberalism in
political theory, to the knowledge production analysis of the current
nationalist discourse, and in connection, a political economy analysis
of separatism in Donbass. This paper's objective does not imply the
embrace of the official Russian state politics. Such an adoption of the
friend-enemy terms, albeit from the other side, would be
counterintuitive to the main theme of this paper. In fact, I hold that
"in trying to reify ethnic boundaries by imputing negative political
meanings to ethnic and linguistic identities, the Ukrainian far right --
ironically -- shares the same goal as the Russian government" (Giuliano
2015: 520). For a more complete picture of the history and the causes of
the Ukraine Crisis, 5 In this essay, I use 'liberal' and 'neoliberal'
interchangeably. I justify this use historically; I take it to be that
'liberal democracy' as a system was first introduced in Ukraine after
the fall of the Soviet Union in its already 'neoliberal' form through
various 'shock therapy' economic, social, political policies. This, some
could point out, limits my analysis because the differentiation between
liberalism and neoliberalism might lead to different results in terms of
their construction of an 'Other' and possible partnership with the
radical right. 6 Although possible, to fully account for the 'cause' of
the civil war would mean to go over a long history of Ukrainian
nation-building, which is not the purpose of this paper. I merely
propose to understand the discourse of friend-enemy that has emerged and
is becoming mainstream in Ukraine today. 47 The Ukrainian Crisis: A Case
of 'New Orientalism' a similar analysis ought to be undertaken with
regards to the 'Russian' side and its specific constructions of Russian
nationalism. The Ukraine Crisis and Its Discourse On November 21, 2013,
then Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych refused to sign a free trade
agreement with the EU that would signal a step towards Ukraine's
eventual EU membership, and instead agreed to a \$15 billion partnership
offer from Russia that signified closer cooperation with Ukraine's
neighbour and potential membership in Russia's Eurasian Customs Union.
This act came to be interpreted as anti-democratic and corrupt by the
majority of Western media sources and Ukrainian citizens, who saw
Yanukovych as advancing a Russian political and economic agenda over the
national interests of Ukraine (The Economist 2013a: 59-60; Greene 2014;
Balmforth 2013). It is instructive to look at how Yanukovych's decision,
and the Ukraine Crisis more broadly, has been framed thus far by the
mainstream media and scholarship in very pro-European terms that
naturalize Western liberal-democratic values. Particularly instructive
is (a) the definition and use of 'democracy' and (b) the way in which
the involvement of the far right among pro-Western forces has been
defined as democratic, downplayed, and/or suppressed. By rejecting the
trade agreement with the EU, the editors of The Economist wrote,
Yanukovych "appeared to hand victory to Vladimir Putin in a struggle
with the EU over Ukraine's geopolitical orientation" (The Economist
2013b: 13). Corruption was defined as 'anti-Western', and Ukrainian
national interests as the interests of the EU. On November 30, 2013, The
Economist wrote that the protests were about a desire for Western values
and governance: "\[...\] standing in temperatures of minus 13C, ready to
be beaten up, the people on Maidan were defending something far greater
than an association agreement with the EU, which was the initial cause.
They were standing in the way of a police state, defending fundamental
European values and defying the post-Soviet order imposed by Russia."
(2013a: 59) Ukraine's political path was framed as a choice between two
opposites -- towards future progress with the EU or back to the corrupt
Soviet past with Russia. The outburst of Ukrainian nationalism was
represented as the desire to live in Europe under liberal-democratic
values. The general response in academia, albeit limited due to the
recent nature of the events, has been similar and can be divided into
two commonplace views. In the first, scholars downplayed or obscured the
role of the radical right at Euromaidan. For example, Olga Onuch
approached the Euromaidan phenomenon along the lines of modernization
theory. She asked: how can we account for such a popular uprising within
the context of struggling democracies everywhere that suffer from low
voter turnout and general popular apathy (2014:44)? For Onuch, the
popular appeal of Western-style democracy serves as evidence that the
liberal subject has developed in Ukraine, despite the Ukrainian state
lagging behind. Therefore, the average protester was a liberal subject
who revolted against the current state-form in order to achieve the
predominance of liberal-democratic European 2017 \| Vol. 9 \| No. 1 48
values and economic prosperity (Onuch 2014: 48). Meanwhile, the
radical-right protester was portrayed as an irrelevant minority (Onuch
2014:46-47). Similarly, Mykola Riabchuk states that what mobilized the
protesters was: "their hope for a 'normal life in a normal country'
which the agreement had envisaged and come to symbolize. Now, as the
government had stolen that hope, \[people\] feel deceived -- it's not
just about this single incident, but about their whole lives, the whole
development of the country stuck for 22 years in a grey zone between
post-Soviet autocracies to the East and increasingly democratizing and
prosperous neighbours to the West." (2013) Here, the West-East dichotomy
mirrors the difference between normal and abnormal government and
society. Where does the radical right fit into this story of good versus
bad? In Ukraine Crisis: What It Means for the West, Andrew Wilson (2014)
gave Maidan a 'truly democratic' progressive legitimacy by placing it
alongside the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring (Ishchenko 2014: 154).
While Wilson could not outright deny the presence of radical
nationalism, he represented its forces at the Maidan as marginal, the
argument being that since these far-right parties did not win in the
subsequent parliamentary elections, they do not represent a credible
threat or significant political faction (Wilson 2014: 86-88, 171-172).
In fact, he wrote that "a torch-lit march through Kiev in honour of the
World War Two Ukrainian Nationalist hero Stepan Bandera on 1 January was
such a stupid idea, it had to be a provocation" (Wilson 2014:86). A
Kyiv-based sociologist, Volodymyr Ishchenko, has come to criticize
Wilson's (and others') view as near-sighted, pointing to the determining
role of political groups such as the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists (OUN), Svoboda Party7 , and Praviy Sektor (the Right
Sector) in the movement (Ishchenko 2014: 13). The second general
response of academia to the Ukraine Crisis accepts in theory and
declares in practice the benefits of the partnership between the
radical-right and liberal forces in Ukraine but does so uncritically.
Jennifer J. Carroll argues that the beauty of Maidan lies precisely in
its unifying nature: the mobilization of elements across class divisions
and ideological affiliations -- both on the left and the right --
through the idea of a nation striving for a European, liberal-democratic
future (2014: 9-10, 12). She argues that academics must put semantics
aside when analysing the radical-right forces. Instead of analysing the
content of radical-right banners (Svoboda and Right Sector), they must
remark on the fact that their members were fighting for the same cause
as the rest of Ukrainians, i.e. "wanting things to be Ukrainian"
(Carroll 2014: 12). While obviously condemning radical-right ideals in
themselves, Carroll does not shy away from suggesting that they were
useful for the Euromaidan cause in general by radicalizing popular
grievances through the idea of the nation. In other words, we can
forgive their slogans so long as they support a European Ukraine against
Eastern separatism and Russian encroachment. Carroll notes that: "many
dedicated members of these so-called 'radical groups took up arms in
cooperation with so-called 'ordinary' Ukrainians against a common enemy
7 The literal translation of 'svoboda' ('свобода') is 'freedom'. 49 The
Ukrainian Crisis: A Case of 'New Orientalism' that threatened the very
dignity and livelihood of the Ukrainian nation \[...\] numerous
protestors told me that radical groups '\[did\] the necessary work of
radicalizing ordinary Ukrainians against their oppressors' and '\[made\]
the nation visible, so that people know what they are fighting for'"
(2014: 12). In a sense, Carroll tries to sanitize the radical right by
fitting it into the bourgeois revolution interpretation of Ukrainian
Euromaidan. Thus, her analysis is not too far off from that of Onuch,
Riabchuk, and Wilson. However, what Carroll makes explicit is that in
the case of Ukraine the project of the radical right and the project of
European liberal-democratic integration are not contradictory.
Democratization Before turning to the analysis of the far right, I want
to address the simple view of 'Euromaidan' as a project of completion of
the 'bourgeois revolution', or a full transition to liberal democracy
that began with the fall of the Soviet Union through the 2004 Orange
Revolution. It is necessary to pose the question, what is the
relationship between the transition to capitalism and the development of
democracy? The debates within democratization and democratic transitions
scholarship that are often informed by modernization theory have focused
on: (a) the ways in which transitions occur and democracies are
consolidated, but also (b) around the similarities and differences
between the various 'waves' of democratization -- in Southern Europe,
Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Indeed, Euromaidan itself has been
presented as another 'wave' of democratic transition in Ukraine.
Philippe Schmitter and Terry Lynn Karl (1994) maintain that in the
post-communist states democratization has, in part, been a strategic
politico-economic project with an international dimension. They write:
"the regime changes in eastern Europe triggered a major collapse in
intraregional trade and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Into this
vacuum moved an extraordinary variety of western advisors and promoters
binational and multilateral. To a far greater extent than elsewhere,
these external actors have imposed political 'conditionality' upon the
process of consolidation, linking specific rewards explicitly to the
meeting of specific norms or even to the selection of specific
institutions'." (Schmitter, Karl 1994: 182) Echoing Schmitter and Karl,
Valerie Bunce (1995) notes that in Eastern Europe democratic transition
implied a number of inter-related processes of restructuring, both
economic and political: the role of the state with regards to its
citizens as well as the international system, liberalization of economy
and foundations of a capitalist society, re-definition of citizenship
via creation of a new capitalist class system (1995: 120-121). Thus,
democratization in the post-communist era was not just a political
regime change but one based on certain economic preconditions. This view
is remnant of the modernization theory model, which suggests a causal
relationship between capitalism and democracy. 2017 \| Vol. 9 \| No. 1
50 Guillermo O'Donnell and Philippe Schmitter (1986), Gerardo Munck
(2011) as well as Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan (1996) assume a normative
value of minimalist democracy. They differentiate between liberalization
and democratization in a manner where economic liberalization can occur
without democratization, whereas democratization usually follows,
entails, and depends on economic liberalization, but on a wider, more
political scale. Their conception of democracy is not very different
from Robert Dahl's "polyarchy", which refers to an electoral,
representative democratic regime only, following the development of a
competitive market-oriented economy, not a "true democracy", which
perhaps is more of an ideal than an achievable reality (Dahl 1989:251).
This analysis shows that 'democracy', and its 'freedom' and 'equality'
is a relative concept. Because the protests at the Maidan have been
interpreted in terms of Ukrainian nation's fight for freedom from
totalitarianism, for equality, and for liberal democratic, European
values, it is the task of political scientists to demystify those very
ideas. A 'transition' to a democracy defined as polyarchy might result
in establishment of valuable political institutions, but it might not
answer all the political and socio-economic demands of the people who
protested at the Maidan and in Eastern Ukraine. Far Right The role of
the far right was central to the victory of the Maidan and since then
has become infiltrated into the new Ukrainian government in Kyiv and its
policy-making. The far right was most active in the setting up of
self-defence units, as well as attacking and occupying government and
administrative buildings, police headquarters and getting access to
armament. As Ishchenko clarifies, Maidan participants were not
middle-class proper (which, if our criterion is based on consumption
patterns, makes up about 10-15 % of the Ukrainian population) but
individuals with nothing to lose, largely, "a movement of dispossessed
workers" (2014: 11, 19). Peculiarly, their grievances were expressed not
in terms of social and economic demands but acute nationalism; aligning
with ultra-nationalist and radicalright movements. In this sense, as
Ishchenko points out, Svoboda became what we may call a popular,
democratic, grassroots party of the Maidan (Ishchenko 2014: 12).
Svoboda, originally founded after the fall of the Soviet Union, was
officially entitled the Social-National Party of Ukraine (Ishchenko
2014: 14). After the three-month struggle at the Maidan, Svoboda emerged
not only as one of the official opposition parties with direct influence
over policy-making but also as a party whose members serve as ministers
in government. Currently, "Svoboda holds a larger chunk of its nation's
ministries (nearly a quarter, including the prized defense portfolio)
than any other far-right party on the \[European\] continent. Ukraine's
deputy prime minister represents Svoboda (the smaller, even more extreme
'Right Sector' coalition fills the deputy National Security Council
chair), as does the prosecutor general and the deputy chair of
parliament." (Foxall and Kesslermarch 2014) 51 The Ukrainian Crisis: A
Case of 'New Orientalism' To be more explicit, Andriy Parubiy was
appointed the new secretary of Ukraine's security council; also a
co-founder of Svoboda, his deputy, Dmytro Yarosh, is the leader of the
Right Sector, and the highest-ranking right-wing extremist is Deputy
Prime Minister Oleksandr Sych, who is also a member of Svoboda (Hughes
2014). Moreover, Western recognition of Svoboda as a legitimate
political player has been common in the aftermath of the Euromaidan: "In
December, shortly after protests began against Ukraine's pro-Russian
president Viktor Yanukovych, U.S. Senator John McCain shared a platform
and an embrace with Svoboda chief Tyahnybok at a mass rally in Kiev,
assuring demonstrators, 'The free world is with you; America is with
you.' In February of this year, France and Germany oversaw a peace deal
between Tyahnybok, two other opposition leaders, and Yanukovych (though
soon after, protests forced Yanukovych to flee to Russia). And in early
March, the U.S. State Department published a debunking of Putin's 'False
Claims About Ukraine,' assuring Americans that Ukraine's farright 'are
not represented' in parliament." (Foxall, Kesslermarch 2014) In terms of
the concrete influence of the far right over government policy, the
magazine Foreign Policy reports that "one of \[Svoboda's\] chief demands
-- that all government business be done in Ukrainian -- was passed into
law, instantaneously marginalizing the one-third of Ukraine's citizens
(and 60 % of Crimeans) who speak Russian. Then for good measure, the
party launched a push to repeal a law against 'excusing the crimes of
fascism'" (Foxall and Kesslermarch 2014). Regardless, the radical
right's greatest success is not its participation in the government but
rather that its ideological discourse has come to dominate the
conversation around Ukraine's present and future. This discursive
triumph has influenced a general right-wing shift in Ukrainian politics
as well as in mainstream and academic thinking, to which Carroll's piece
itself serves as a prime example. For instance, the ideological symbols
and slogans such as "Glory to the Nation! Death to the Enemies!" and
"Glory to Ukraine! To heroes, glory!" which before the outbreak were
traditionally expressed exclusively in ultra-nationalist circles, were
transformed into common, quite mainstream parlance (Ishchenko 2014:15;
Luhn 2014). On the Memorial Day of the Victims of Repression, the leader
of Svoboda, Tyahnybok, proclaimed (in a rough English translation): "For
us, the nationalists, it is not enough that Parliament because of
certain political situation, of necessity, finally adopted
anti-communist laws. By the way, from the first days of its foundation
'Svoboda' constantly stressed the need to adopt similar legislation. But
now it is absolutely essential these laws take an effect in Ukrainian
state. It is also important that psychology of all Ukrainians was turned
to Ukrainian manner and every Ukrainian looked at the world in the light
of Ukrainian's view but not through bolshevik-communist-Kremlin glasses.
Because, unfortunately, nowadays anti-Ukrainian and Moscow's influence
is largely maintained in 2017 \| Vol. 9 \| No. 1 52 Ukraine. It is
important to remember our true heroes, honour their memory, especially
in such places like this Memorial complex." (Svoboda 2015) At the same
time, on its official website, Svoboda is also described as: "a modern
political party, which is open to cooperation. In our international
activities we are looking for those supporting traditional European
values, human rights, the rights of nations, respect their sovereignty
and oppose imperialism; those partners, whose vision concerning Ukraine,
European and global challenges has something in common with our own
point of view." (Svoboda 2015) There appears to be a contradiction of
tone between the first and the second statement. With regard to the
second statement, we sense the apprehension about the risk of being
perceived as a far-right party, and hence, the desire to establish
itself as liberal and European and truly legitimate. Whereas, in the
first statement, which reveals an organic, naturalistic view of a
nation, Tyahnybok places the idea of the 'nation' above
liberal-democratic values, such as individual freedom of choice and
association. On the one hand, the official economic rhetoric of the
opposition parties, including Svoboda, has been one of striving for a
bourgeois identity, for a 'European', globalized Ukraine with open
markets, and adoption of the EU's current neoliberal austerity policies.
The new neoliberal government "accepted all the credit conditions
imposed by the IMF -- increasing public utility tariffs, freezing wages,
cutting a whole range of benefits \[...\] that would put the burden of
the economic crisis on the poor" (Ishchenko 2014: 22). On the other
hand, the underlying ideology of the economic regime has become the
radical-right nationalism: freedom for the Ukrainian nation and the
right of self-determination of the 'Ukrainian' people, based on their
ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical distinction from the
'Russian' nation. The Solidarity Bloc of Petro Poroshenko, the majority
party in government, relies for its legitimacy on the Maidan revolution
as a victory against both internal and external aggression against
Ukraine, against what it calls the "enslavement" of the Ukrainian people
(The Solidarity Bloc 2014). Here, enslavement is invoked selectively and
excised from socio-economic conditions. What are we to make of this
contradictory marriage between liberalism and nationalism? Between, on
the one hand liberal universalism and, on the other, Ukrainian national
exclusivity? One explanation for this coalition has to do with tactics:
the (neo)liberal economic and political Ukrainian elite needed to align
themselves with ultra nationalism. The radical-right forces were
critical in representing popular sentiments. As Ishchenko points out,
"part of the reason why the intelligentsia didn't take a distance from
the far-right may have been that they knew they were objectively weak,
and thought that dissociating themselves from Svoboda and Right Sector
would mean being sidelined from the movement altogether; the alliance
was too important to them" (2014: 16). Thus, the politicians and the
intelligentsia adopted radical nationalism as the only successful way to
argue for a European Ukraine. An explanation of the local interests
should be situated within the global context. Such an account can
highlight that the political and economic agenda of Ukraine is partly
enforced by powerful 53 The Ukrainian Crisis: A Case of 'New
Orientalism' external interests, where Ukrainian elites potentially
represent global rather than national interests and use nationalist
rhetoric to legitimate a global economic and political agenda.8 In line
with this interpretation, others suggest that far-right nationalisms in
post-Soviet states often perform a compensatory function for those who
are the economic 'losers' of the transition to a neoliberal capitalist
order. They argue, "it is the 'transition losers' \[...\] who experience
a sense of insecurity, are frustrated with the democratic experience,
and seek refuge in nationalist values" (Häusermann and Kriesi 2011).
This analysis suggests that in Ukraine, neoliberalism -- in its global
and local form -- relies on the far right's nationalist discourse for
legitimation in lieu of substantial economic security. I return to the
political economic analysis after a reading of Carl Schmitt's critique
of liberalism that helps to conceptualize events in Ukraine. Schmitt:
The Political In The Concept of the Political, Schmitt characterizes
liberalism as a movement for universal pacifism, which negates the
political-fundamental status of man -- the friend-enemy distinction and
a natural inclination to war. There are two dimensions to his critique
of liberalism. First, Schmitt shows that the liberal project aims to
universalize the human condition, deny and neutralize the political.
Liberal democracy, Schmitt writes, appears as "a completely pacified
globe, \[...\] without the distinction of friend and enemy and hence a
world without politics" (Schmitt 1976: 35). The liberal-bourgeois
individual: "rests in the possession of his private property, and under
the justification of his possessive individualism he acts as an
individual against the totality. He is a man who finds his compensation
for his political nullity in the fruits of freedom and enrichment and
above all in the total security of its use. Consequently, he wants to be
spared bravery and exempted from the danger of a violent death."
(Schmitt 1976: 62-63) Secondly, and more importantly, Schmitt unmasks
power, or the political enmity from under liberal pacifism. It serves to
reproduce his thoughts verbatim: "the concept of humanity is an
especially useful ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and
in its ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic
imperialism \[...\] To confiscate the word humanity, to invoke and
monopolize such a term probably has certain incalculable effects, such
as denying the enemy the quality of being human and declaring him to be
an outlaw of humanity; and a war can thereby be driven to the most
extreme inhumanity." (1976: 54) 8 For a critical account of the history
of global capitalism, and specifically the discussion of 'empire by
invitation', please see Panitch and Gindin (2012). 2017 \| Vol. 9 \| No.
1 54 Thus, depoliticisation defined as universal humanism is an ideology
that covers the true intentions of those who use it for their own
(economic or national) advantage. By presenting their values as
universally valid human values, the proponents of liberalism first
dehumanize their opponents only to then legitimately destroy them as
enemies of humanity. For example, in calling the League of Nations an
imperialist "alliance" of states, Schmitt argues that international
political bodies do not eliminate war. Rather, they legitimize and
sanction them against those enemies that could not be incorporated or
suppressed (1976: 55-56). In the next section, I attempt to show how the
current liberal project in Ukraine (for now) supports Schmitt's
diagnosis. Bringing together a discursive and a political economic
analysis, I suggest that the declaration of the 'enemy' in the Ukraine
Crisis has taken the form of a 'new Orientalism'. 'New Orientalism'
Discourse and Its Critique The term '[Orientalism' was first coined by
Edward Said to describe a process by which Western societies constructed
'Eastern' colonized cultures as backward and primitive, and in doing so
named themselves developed, modern, and rational. Anthropologist Michal
Buchowski and feminist scholar Sedef Arat-Koc augment Said's analysis to
understand a new phenomenon in Eastern Europe where 'Orientalist'
thinking is applied internally, to the post-Soviet 'losers' of
globalization. By using their framework of 'New Orientalism', I argue
that in Ukraine, as part of the process of homogenization with Europe,
we see a construction of a new identity. The 'Other' in this context is
what Buchowski terms the 'homo-Sovieticus', whose existence occurs
within national borders but by definition is seen as anachronistic.
Whereas previously all of Eastern Europe in Western eyes appeared "as
'neither fish, nor fowl', semi-oriental, not fully European,
semi-developed, and semicivilized," in the process of Western
incorporation of Eastern Europe after 1989, there has been "a
restructuring of the perception of social inequalities by the hegemonic
liberal ideology" (Buchowski 2006: 464). Buchowski explains, "the degree
to which various countries, authorities, social groups and individuals
have embraced the free market and democracy -- evaluated by those
powerful who set rules of the game -- has become a yardstick for
classifying different regions, countries and groups as fitting more or
less into the category of 'us' i.e. '(post)modern-Western-liberals'."
(2006: 464-465) No longer geographically defined, those who have not
embraced 'Europe' for ideological or socio-economic reasons are deemed
irretrievably backward and, virtually, ethnically different. Arguments
from essentialised cultural standpoints dismiss and delegitimize any
disagreement about political and economic development. Arat-Koc
highlights how 'culture' is used to hide political economic issues: "as
neoliberal hegemonies exclude theories that demonstrate failure as
central and integral to the functioning of capitalism and inevitable, as
social, economic, and historical explanations for failure are excluded
from 55 The Ukrainian Crisis: A Case of 'New Orientalism' hegemonic
discourses, 'culture' (as a reductionist, essentialized, shrunk,
caricatured version of what the term could otherwise mean) becomes the
'only' accepted 'explanation' in mainstream discourse."]{.underline}
(2014: 329) Echoing Schmitt's critique of liberalism, this reveals the
very undemocratic nature of the 'liberal-democratic' project in general
and in Ukraine, in particular. [In the case of Ukraine, the backward
'Other' is ideologically associated with Russian politics, culture, and
language, both inside and outside the nation-state. Due to the history
of Western and Eastern imperialism, the ideological but nonetheless real
and material border between West and East in Ukraine demarcates people
by language, culture, ethnic affiliation and even political ideology,
i.e. liberalism in the progressive West and socialism in the backward
East.]{.underline} As evident from Tyahnybok's statement above,
communism and the working-class movements have been associated with
Russian political culture and history, and therefore viewed as a Russian
imperial imposition both from within and from without. The
oversimplified identification of present-day Russia with the Soviet
Union, as well as with communism itself, is ahistorical. First, it
obscures the history of Ukraine, as nineteenth-century Ukrainian
nationalism was openly leftist, not to mention that it maintained a
strong anarchist tradition that was born in central Ukraine under Nestor
Makhno (Ischchenko 2014: 16-17). Secondly, that Russian nationality and
language, and socialism have become synonymous is wildly inaccurate,
since Russia is no longer (and presumably never has been) a socialist
state: its economy is now quite obviously structured by capitalist
social relations, even if at variance (i.e. the prominent role of
'oligarchs' and patrimonialism) with Western models of capitalism.
Studies of the local population's agency in self-determination movements
in the Donbass region have been scarce. In order to dismiss
Eastern-Ukrainian concerns as illegitimate, the use of 'New Orientalist'
discourse by politicians, academics, and reporters helps present them as
irrational and dehumanized compared to the civilized 'ethnic'
Western-Ukrainians advocating for proper Western institutions and
values. If we look at yet another one of Tiahnybok's statements, we find
another demarcation along friend-enemy lines of 'civilized' versus
'uncivilized': "In Donbas, gangs of armed terrorists are shouting
separatist slogans and -- with the support of the Kremlin -- carry out
physical destruction of the Ukrainian nation. They are, de facto,
beginning an ethnic cleansing -- people get killed for saying 'Glory to
Ukraine!', for speaking Ukrainian language and/or wearing
'vyshyvankas.'9 People are kidnapped just because they are Ukrainians.
Three of Svoboda's representatives have also been abducted. This mess
must stop -- the state has a duty to its citizens, thus should eliminate
terrorism and guarantee security of the people." (Svoboda 2015) 9
'Vyshyvanka' is a colloquial term for an embroidered peasant blouse in
Ukrainian traditional costume. In the aftermath of the Euromaidan, it
has been used as a symbol of Ukraine's freedom, worn in the mainstream,
and popularized by the fashion industry in Ukraine and in the West. 2017
\| Vol. 9 \| No. 1 56 Evidently, the centre of the focus is not the
protesters' practical demands but their 'character' and nationality. In
fact, there has been a "spread of dehumanizing rhetoric against the
movement in Eastern Ukraine \[...\] after the Odessa massacre on 2 May,
when thirty people were burned to death in the Trade Union building,
\[and\] some Ukrainian nationalists were exultant" (Ishchenko 2014: 32).
The materiality of the shift of the official discourse to the right is
striking. While ethnic, cultural, and language differences have been
employed to explain the politics of separatism in the East, the three
are not so easily discernible into separate and sovereign 'Ukrainian'
and 'Russian' identities. Elise Giuliano explains, "Cultural boundaries
between Russians and Ukrainians are fuzzy and faint, as indicated by the
high rate of inter-ethnic marriage there. Russians and Ukrainians share,
for the most part, a common religion -- Eastern Orthodoxy, or a
secularism inherited from the Soviet era; a common language (Russian),
very similar languages (Ukrainian and Russian), or a mixture of the two
(Surzhyk); and a host of social practices and cultural expectations
based on their shared experience as Soviet and post-Soviet citizens
\[\...\] In general, the porosity of cultural boundaries suggests that
ethnic identity by itself provides little information about why many
people in the east feel alienated from the Ukrainian state." (2015:
516-517) Much evidence indicates that cultural and linguistic
essentialism have been constructed by and used in favour of a certain
political-economic project. However, the association of language and
support for separatism has not been a static one throughout Ukraine's
history. For instance, in the Donbass region those citizens who have
reported that their national language is Ukrainian still voted for
Yanukovych in the 2012 presidential elections (Ibid.). Even after
language became politicized in the aftermath of the Maidan by the
political elites (via Ukraine's interim government's annulment of
language law making Russian an official language of the Ukrainian state
that was passed under Yanukovych in 2012), residents of the Donbass
region did not see it as the main reason behind separation. Giuliano
provides statistical evidence: "In an International Republican Institute
(IRI) poll, 74% of respondents in east Ukraine (Donestsk;
Dnepropetrovsk; Kharkhiv; Luhansk) answered either 'definitely no' or
'not really' when asked: 'Do you feel that Russian-speaking citizens of
Ukraine are under pressure or threat because of their language?' A
majority of ethnic Russians also answered 'definitely no' (49%) and not
really (17%)." (2015: 518) Instead, in agreement with both Giuliano and
Ishchenko, I propose that it is more useful to understand the alienation
experienced by the population in the Donbass region from the new
Ukrainian government and Euromaidan in political-economic terms. The
Donbass region is the most industrialized and urbanized area of Ukraine.
The older Soviet enterprises 57 The Ukrainian Crisis: A Case of 'New
Orientalism' in the area -- mostly coal industry and metallurgy -- were
a central production hub in the USSR and after its fall; it produced for
Russia as its biggest trading partner (Ishchenko 2014). The local
economy and social relations, due to a close geographic proximity, are
tied to Russia's. Thus: "in the estimations of ordinary people, joining
the Customs Union would maintain trade ties with Russia and other
post-Soviet states and therefore preserve jobs and the status quo. A
shift in economic orientation toward Europe would bring uncertainty to
the region. Such a change, moreover, would affect large numbers of
workers since Donetsk and Luhansk are overwhelmingly urban (90% and
10%)." (Giuliano, 2015: 518-519) The region opposed Ukraine's EU
association out of a practical prediction of losing jobs through
privatization or shutting down of national enterprises and industries,
which are central to employing the urban population and sustaining their
lives. The strategic-economic interests of the Donbass region are
dismissed as ideological and cultural, as if Eastern Ukrainians must
automatically disagree with EU association and values by virtue of being
labelled ethnically 'Russian' by Western Ukrainians. In connection to
the political economic question, Giuliano (2015) emphasizes the
political-symbolic alienation of the Donbass residents from the
Euromaidan movement and the new Ukrainian government, due to their
conception of nationhood in ethnically exclusivist terms. Giuliano
explains, "\[...\] some Ukrainian elites articulated an interpretation
of Ukrainian history that, put in stark terms, viewed the past through
Stalin's crimes such as collectivization which produced the Great Famine
of 1932 (the Holomodor). In this view, Ukraine is a victim of the
imperialist Soviet Union which perpetrated genocide and destroyed
Ukrainian language and culture. More extreme versions of this view
celebrate Stepan Bandera and factions of the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists -- a group that fought the Soviets during World War II in
part by making common cause with the Nazis. Advocates of these ideas
identify postSoviet Russia and ethnic Russians with the Soviet Union
\[...\] Their ideology fit in with a strand of ultranationalist
discourse that, over the years, had scapegoated ethnic Russians for the
country's problems and identified them with the Soviet Union and Russia.
After Maidan, Ukraine's interim government did not criticize
ultranationalist discourse, but instead appointed a former leader of a
neo-fascist party, Andriy Parubiy, to the important post of head of
Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council \[\...\] More
dangerously, as the violence heated up, Kiev allowed semi-private
paramilitary groups---such as the far right, neo-Nazi Azov Battalion --
to fight in east Ukraine." (2015: 519-520) 2017 \| Vol. 9 \| No. 1 58 In
concluding this section, I want to bring together the discursive and the
political economic analyses. The very history of Ukraine, its language,
and culture has been reinvented in Western, liberal terms. Aside from
the evident materiality of the civil war, which reproduces and reflects
certain narratives of national ethnicity as well as global political
economic interests, Ukraine is a contemporary example of how knowledge
production is a political economic issue. Conclusion Revealing the
discourse around the Ukraine Crisis in terms of a 'New Orientalism'
helps explain the relationship between liberalism and nationalism that
became 'common sense' at Euromaidan and, currently, in the larger
Ukraine Crisis. The modernization school of thought claimed that with
the end of the Cold War era of ideology, the spread of capitalist social
relations and consequently the transitions to liberal democracy would
create political homogenization and render ethnic conflict irrelevant.
At a first glance, the current Ukraine Crisis fits this vision as an
example of homogenizing political and economic forces at work,
transitioning Ukraine into a 'true' liberal democratic capitalist
society. It was not the purpose of this paper to deny that Euromaidan is
a popular, democratic phenomenon. The purpose of this paper was, first,
to interrogate what is meant by 'democracy' -- and whether or not its
institutionalization will fulfil the demands of protesters and second,
to complicate the romanticized story of a fight for liberal, European
values in light of the radical right's participation in Euromaidan and
advance into the new Ukrainian government. In Ukraine, as part of the
process of homogenization with Europe, we see a process of the invention
of the Ukrainian nation in ethnic, exclusivist terms, which defines a
section of Ukraine's society as a backward 'ethnicity'. This distinction
has concretely manifested in the ongoing violent conflict between the
Donbass region and Western and Central Ukraine. Following Schmitt's
critique of liberalism, I argue that the Ukrainian Crisis reveals how
liberalism, in this specific historical and geopolitical context, relies
on a certain friend-enemy distinction for the advancement of its
supposed universalist project. As a way of moving beyond the New
Orientalist discourse, I suggest that we understand the
political-economic reasons for the separatist politics in Eastern
Ukraine, which might point in a useful direction of the re-evaluation of
the official Ukrainian as well as the general European political,
economic, and social policies.

### CHINA

#### Fears of the rising power of China are rooted in a techno-Orientalist discourse that justifies colonial violence in the name of the Other

Political Science, 1--17. doi:10.1080/02185377.2018.1515640. EC

In an effort to generate critical self- reflexivity on practices of
Orientalism and Occidentalism there has been a proliferation of
discourses on 'strategic Orientalism', 'techno Orientalism' and
'military Orientalism' as discussed below. Keith Krause and Andrew
Latham (1998) argue that [practices of 'strategic orientalism'
constitute the 'foundation of Western security culture']{.underline}
(Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 41). They assert that [strategic orientalism
is premised on the 'pervasive and axiomatic belief that the West (or
occasionally the United States) as a civilization has a special role to
play in global security affairs'']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998,
pp. 41, 37). This is [based on 'a reading of the politico-strategic
objectives and purposes of Third World states that is informed more by
Western fears and prejudices than by the realities of politics in these
states']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 38). [The deep-rooted
fear of the attacking Asian hordes and their ability to industrialize
and develop sophisticated weapons reinforces twenty-first century
concerns about the 'Rising East']{.underline}. [This 'phenomenon of
imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-or hypertechnological terms in
cultural productions and political discourse']{.underline} is understood
as 'techno-Orientalism' (Roh et al., 2015, p. 2). [Practices of
techno-Orientalism driven by 'imperial aspirations' and 'appetites of
consumerist societies' are 'infused with the languages and codes of the
technological and futuristic' and in 'digital spaces abound with
reinscribed racial tropes and stereotypes]{.underline}; these are sites
[in which racialization is more likely reinforced than
challenged']{.underline} (Roh et al., 2015, p. 14). [Scholars developing
the concept of techno-Orientalism observe its 'growing prevalence in the
Western cultural consciousness']{.underline} and suggest that [the 'US
techno Orientalist imagination has its roots in the view of Asian body
... as a form of expendable technology']{.underline} (Roh et al., 2015,
pp. 7--11). Nevertheless they insist that the scope of
techno-Orientalism is 'expansive and bi-directional' and ponder on the
'danger that Asian and Asian American creators ... might internalize
techno Orientalist patterns and uncritically replicate the same
dehumanizing model' (Roh et al., 2015, pp. 3, 7). But unlike strategic
Orientalism and techno-Orientalism, Military Orientalism is described as
an exercise undertaken to investigate the mental baggage of Western
consciousness accumulated from an interest in 'non-Western warfare'
(Porter, 2013, pp. 16--17). [The endeavor of military Orientalism is to
unpack the 'range of assumptions and myths through which Westerners gaze
on the military East]{.underline} and engage in a critical dialogue with
our own preconceptions' (Porter, 2013, pp. 16--17). It encourages
Westerners to voice their own 'fears about themselves, their survival,
identity and values, through different visions of non-Western warfare'
(Porter, 2013, p. 21). Military Orientalism issues a warning against
reducing military history to a morality play (Porter, 2013, p. 75). But
it is open to the idea that [our common experiences of suffering can
help cultivate a 'source of critical self-reflection to perhaps nurture
some understanding of the 'intimacy of the relationship']{.underline}
(Naeem & David, 2004, p. 187; Nandy, 1983). In investigating the
intimacy of a relationship it might be possible to glean and 'retrieve
recessive images and practices' that have been historically constituted
through a network 4 R. MATHUR of social relations and processes (Naeem &
David, 2004, p. 191). These might present creative opportunities to move
beyond 'policing boundaries of self as an exclusive and homogenous
space' and instead 'appreciate and claim the self that exists as part of
the other beyond those boundaries' (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 204). Porter
insists on 'the interactive and power-political nature of war, which has
a culture of its own that can change all parties to a conflict' (2013,
p. 55). Porter claims that, 'paradoxically, war can drive cultures
closer together' (2013, p. 33). This is because, '[war ... is not simply
a clash of Others, made possible by an ignorant horror of difference.
The warrior looks out at the enemy and sees men who are, in crucial
respects, recognizably like himself']{.underline} (Porter, 2013, p. 34).
He also argues that [an engagement with, 'the foreign "Other" can be
treated as a superior model to inform self-examination']{.underline}
(2013, p. 108). But this hopeful promise of Military Orientalism has not
stemmed the tide of populist discourses deploying the dynamic of
difference between 'The West and the Rest' in the aftermath of the Cold
War to wage and perpetuate a global War on Terror. On the contrary it is
possible to argue that [there is deliberate and contingent deployment of
a 'decivilizing rhetoric that blends irrational, aggressive, rigid,
paranoid and exceptionalist discourses to demonize Other-ness' and give
'unwarranted authority and autonomy' to 'militarist and imperialist
discourses of national security']{.underline} (Taylor, 2007, p. 670).
[There is 'sustained use of decivilizing imagery' that 'represents the
United States as a virtuous nation reluctantly but legitimately
fulfilling its divine mandate to use civilized reason and superior
force' vis-a vis 'nuclear capable and aspiring nations in Asia, Africa
and the Middle East' depicted in a 'racist, sexist language that
reproduces colonial ideology]{.underline}. As such [it rejects the
authority and legitimacy of these nations as potential possessors of
nuclear weapons and solidifies continued dominance by the United States
of the nuclear strategic environment']{.underline} (Taylor, 2007, p.
685). The strength of these populist discourses reinforcing a dynamic of
difference and denial is exhibited with the contemporary 'malpractice'
of the Trump administration to not respect the nuclear deal negotiated
with Iran (Kimball, 2018). [Nuclear weapons have long been regarded as
'a new technological deity' and 'a divinely offered gift that endorsed
American exceptionalism]{.underline} and imbued its creators with
God-like power [and the mission to restore order and justice in a fallen
world.']{.underline} (Taylor, 2007, p. 677). Gabrielle Hecht (2012)
defines nuclear exceptionalism as 'insistence on an essential nuclear
difference -- manifested in political claims, technological systems,
cultural forms, institutional infrastructures, and scientific knowledge'
and insists 'nuclear exceptionalism could be made, unmade, and remade'
as 'for all efforts at making nuclear things exceptional, there were
opposing attempts to render them banal' (Hecht, pp. 6-- 8). It is
important to bear this in mind as this pernicious dynamic of difference
and exceptionalism becomes even more acute with current US President
Donald Trump's everyday populist declarations. He is on record for
stating that the US will be at the 'top of the pack' 'until such time as
the world comes to its senses regarding nukes' (Holland, 2017). In his
recent visit to Poland 'to summon the courage and the will to defend our
civilization' [Trump (2017) claims 'there are dire threats to our
security and our way of life' and argues, 'the fundamental question of
our time is whether the West has the will to survive.']{.underline}
There is little doubt in his mind of the 'triumph' of the West (Holland,
2017). It is therefore helpful to pause in this tumultuous 'history of
the present' and suggest that 'every identity owes a debt to alterity'
(Naeem & David, 2004, p. 8). Thus it is ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL
SCIENCE 5 interesting to observe how the existing literature on 'dynamic
of difference' between Orientalism and Occidentalism has expanded its
arsenal with a more complex conceptual apparatus of Strategic
Orientalism, Techno Orientalism and Military Orientalism to helps us
grasp the everyday practices of techno-racial dynamic of differences
that cultivate and nurture techno-racial stereotypes. These [stereotypes
more often than not dictate modes of behavior that make the Other 'a
monster that must not only be defeated but also utterly
destroyed]{.underline} ... an enemy who no longer must be compelled to
retreat into his borders only' (Schmitt, 2007). [It is this 'dynamic of
difference' with its persistent desire to annihilate the
Other]{.underline}, makes one wonder, whether [it is not a complementary
sub-text for an increasingly alarming and growing superstructure of a
'dynamic of denial' in weapons]{.underline} [control]{.underline}? A
dynamic of denial so petulant that it casts its shadow in celebrating
the recent success of a Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty (2017).

To cheat and thief, [we can layer the trope of lawlessness, readily
employed in media representations and political rhetoric over maritime
territorial and EEZ disputes involving China and its
neighbors]{.underline} in the Western Pacific. China's territorial
claims in the South China Sea are largely historical in nature and do
encroach on the 200 nautical miles EEZ of neighboring countries such as
the Philippines and Vietnam. The United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS) does not expressly prohibit land reclamation in the sea
as long as due notice is given to other concerned states and due regard
to the rights of other states (Art. 60.3, 56.2, and 56.3) is taken into
account, while the obligation to protect and preserve the marine
environment is observed (Art. 192). Parties to a dispute are also
obligated to refrain from acting in a manner that would jeopardize or
hamper a final agreement resolving the dispute (Art. 74.3 and 83.3).
[The frantic building of artificial islands to enhance the legality of
China's claims, unilateral installations, and skirmishes in the disputed
areas are thus amenable to interpretation as lawless
bullying]{.underline}. [An editorial in the Wall Street
Journal]{.underline} titled "Calling Out China's Lawlessness; The US
Points Out that Beijing's Claims to the South China Sea Don't Stand Up,"
[describes the "sketchy legality of its \[Beijing's\]
actions"]{.underline} and claims that "China is changing the status quo
in the South China Sea with force and the threat of force" ("Calling
Out," 2014). [This characterization in the media is consistent with
political rhetoric]{.underline}. US Secretary of State John Kerry was
reported to have said in May 2014 that China's "introduction of an oil
rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was
provocative" (Ives & Fuller, 2014). Eliot Engel of the House of
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee framed China's actions in
skirmishes with Vietnam as "needless provocations" (Engel, 2014). At the
same time, [media representations and political rhetoric have tended to
obscure the fact that China's regional neighbors all built airstrips and
outposts on the claimed islands long before China ever did.]{.underline}
China also displays inconsistent behavior in that it has reached
agreements with Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin and South Korea in the
Yellow Sea to divide fisheries equally and carry out joint enforcement
patrols in keeping with international law.3 Indeed, China has in land
disputes signed "fair and balanced" treaties with 13 out of 14 neighbors
in keeping with international legal principles (Kraska, 2015). [These
instances have not, however, drawn any significant media
attention.]{.underline} Instead, [the emphasis on China's non-compliance
with international law in the South China Sea disputes has served to
recapitulate China in Orientalist terms as uncivilized and,]{.underline}
moreover, as [a fully awakened "sleeping giant" that bullies its
neighbors and is unsuited to replace the US as regional leader. US
political rhetoric and media representation has also obscured the
vagueness of international law when applied to the East China
Sea]{.underline} dispute as it would be inconsistent with the image of
China as a lawless bully in the South China Sea. The UNCLOS appears to
have a straightforward framework that gives states maritime jurisdiction
over resources 200 nautical miles from their coastal baseline, but it
says nothing about how overlapping maritime jurisdictions are to be
resolved. In the case of the East China Sea, the area of dispute is only
360 miles across at its widest point. At the heart of the territorial
dispute between China and Japan is the "territorial acquisition" of the
Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, but there is no convention on how states
acquire sovereignty over disputed territories.4 The flexibility of
applicable principles in international customary law have instead
allowed both China and Japan to invoke the law to justify their claims
to sovereignty (Ramos-Mrosovsky, 2008). [China's refusal to have the
dispute adjudicated by an international body reflects the
unpredictability of outcomes]{.underline} and not necessarily China's
lawlessness, especially when viewed, in light of a similar disinterest
on the part of the Japanese. [The essentialization of China as lawless,
despite the malleability of international law and dissimilar behavior in
other disputes, has the potential to drive a wedge between China and her
neighbors]{.underline}, thus "containing" China's growing influence in
the region. Indeed, [the depiction of China as a lawless bully plays up
the insecurities of its immediate]{.underline}---and in many cases, much
weaker---[neighbors, whose heavy reliance on international law to
constrain hegemonic behavior is palpable]{.underline}. The breaking of
norms has been identified as a crucial signal that heightens threat
perception (Farnham, 2003). In the context of long-standing maritime
territorial disputes, [playing up an image of China as a lawless bully
also suggests that the United States continues to be a necessary power
broker in the region]{.underline}. The notion that there is an
overbearing bully in the neighborhood that could care less about the
rules of the game returns the United States to the role of protector in
the post--Cold War period---its ostensible "manifest destiny." Since the
late 1990s, titles such as "Spratly Spat Heats up over Chinese
'Bullying'" (Lamb, 1998) or "Asian Nations Support US Silently"
(Wiseman, 2001) demonstrate how constructing China as a lawless bully
serves to reinforce this purpose. Indeed, a recent editorial in The Wall
Street Journal makes this link explicit in the text: Washington's
hesitant response has allowed controversy to build around
freedom-of-navigation missions that should be routine. Beijing's
strategy in the South China Sea is to bully its neighbors and achieve
regional hegemony through coercive means short of war. Turning peaceful
naval patrols into diplomatic hot potatoes is exactly the sort of change
Beijing seeks. ("A 12-Mile," 2015) Here, China's behavior is portrayed
as incorrigibly belligerent, in distinct contrast to genteel US
diplomacy. One Wall Street Journal article makes this point clear in its
title alone: "Chinese Diplomacy Off Course; By Overreaching in the South
China Sea, Beijing has Drawn the US Irrevocably into the Debate" (Wain,
2000). [This article embodies the dominant narrative that assumes
implicitly the rightful role of the United States to dole out proper
diplomacy and take on any transgressors to maintain world
peace]{.underline}. [A Wall Street Journal article]{.underline}
describing China's "increasingly powerful---but highly opaque---military
and its more assertive stance \[towards the South China Sea\]"
[emphasize China's military as an inherent threat to world order but
construct the US military according to a different standard, again
assuming the righteousness of US military intervention]{.underline}
(Page, 2011). In this regard, it is important to note that [US grand
strategy consists of preventing the development of any regional power
capable of obstructing US access to Eurasia]{.underline}---where most of
the world's resources and economic activity are located. This long-term
security goal has informed the Obama administration's much-touted
Pacific Pivot policy, which many have viewed as a "China containment
policy." A Congressional Report notes that although U.S. policymakers
have not often stated this key national strategic goal explicitly in
public, U.S. military (and diplomatic) operations in recent
decades---both wartime operations and day-to-day operations---can be
viewed as having been carried out in no small part in support of this
key goal. (O'Rourke, 2014) China's territorial claims in the South China
Sea cover about 90% of the area that could potentially allow China to
deny the United States such access. As China continues with the
modernization of its naval and air capabilities, [US apprehension has
increased that the disputed land features in the South China Sea are
being used to bolster military and coast guard forces]{.underline} that
can monitor and respond to the activities of US allies, deny the US navy
access to these waters, and ultimately check US naval dominance in the
region. It is for this reason that the [United States has insisted on
freedom of navigation and innocent passage---protected by
UNCLOS---through these contested waters]{.underline}, although tensions
with China have ratcheted up considerably as a result. As direct
conflict between the United States and China has become a real
possibility, and as the United States has not ratified the UNCLOS, [the
United States has attempted to base its actions on firm legal
principles, and in turn, to frame China's behavior in the region as
lawlessness]{.underline}. Through US portrayals of China as a lawless
bully, [China incurs reputational costs in the global and regional
community that have the potential to exert pressure on China to stand
down]{.underline}. The guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen was thus sent
in October 2015 on a "freedom of navigation" patrol within 12 nautical
miles of islands artificially built by China in the Spratly chain, which
the United States insists is in compliance with international law.5 [The
United States revealed this aim in another dispute on whether China has
an international legal right to regulate foreign military actors
operating within China's 200-nautical-mile EEZ.]{.underline} The United
States' view, which China disagrees with, is that China has a right to
restrict military and surveillance activities only within 12 nautical
miles of its territorial waters. Tensions reached new heights when China
announced in November 2013 an East China Sea Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) that not only covered her territorial waters but extended
into its EEZ and thus, the contested areas in the East China Sea. US
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel responded in a press statement that "We
view this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo
in the region. This unilateral action increases the risk of
misunderstanding and miscalculations," yet the United States followed
shortly by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone (Harlan, 2013).
Certainly, there have been media analyses that characterize China's
behavior as motivated by normal national self-interest or that point out
that US actions to curtail China are "hypocritical" and "hegemonic"
(see, for example, Denyer, 2015; Wu, 2005). However, [many more choose
to reprise long-standing debates about whether China is a military
threat or not]{.underline}, with titles such as "US Starting to View
China as Potential Enemy" (Mann, 1995) and "Weakening Yet Still
Aggressive, China Poses Test for U.S. Presidential Candidates" (Sanger,
2015). [None take seriously China's claims that its actions in the
region have been defensive in nature]{.underline}. Even with a wide
range of opinions on the matter, by focusing on the issue of China's
military buildup, [these news articles only serve to heighten this
perceived threat by inferring threatening intent from growing military
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Portrayal of China as a malicious actor juxtaposes the role of the benign US in cyber warfare

[The construction of China as potential enemy Other takes on an
additional hue when we look at the depictions of China's cyber
activities]{.underline}---[China moves from cheat to a more malicious
cousin, the thief.]{.underline} The United States first focused on
issues of "cyber warfare" in the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but at the
time, the trope associated with China was not necessarily that of thief.
In the mass news media[, a militaristic lens framed much of the
discussion, depicting China as a rule breaker flouting international
norms and thus posing a security threat]{.underline}. For example, a Los
Angeles Times article highlighted that "China in the last year has
developed ways to infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the
world in what U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially
dangerous military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes,
2008). China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda: "[Cyber-attacks and
cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to U.S. national
security than Al Qaeda and other militants]{.underline} that have
dominated America's global focus since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation's top
intelligence officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013). This
[juxtaposition with al-Qaeda only served to heighten the military
valence of China's cyber activities, and a push to prepare for such a
threat]{.underline}. Indeed, in the words of Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL):
"The threat, to be sure, is real---and, we cannot allow ourselves to
grow complacent ..." (Nelson 2008). Snowden's revelations of US spying
on China in June of 2013 drastically changed the shape of the discussion
however. Snowden demonstrated that the NSA (1) had two data centers in
China from which it had been inserting spy software into vulnerable
computers; (2) targeted the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public
officials, businesses, and students; (3) hacked mobile phones; and (4)
in 2009, hacked the Pacnet headquarters in Hong Kong, which runs one of
the biggest regional fibre-optic networks. In response to Snowden's
revelations, a spate of articles compared the United States' and China's
hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from journalists---some
espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent transgressive
behavior, while [others argued that China has crossed the line into more
aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States' more benign
"preemptive" hacking]{.underline}. [The latter attitude indicates the
resilience of tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils, a China whose
inherent ideological and cultural differences with the West makes it a
threat.]{.underline} The different lenses through which journalists and
pundits viewed China's spying in comparison with that of the United
States further invoke this Orientalist demarcation. An article in The
Washington Post thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the
United States, which merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of
communication metadata around the world to look for trends" and "to
preempt some threat against the U.S." [China's spying is described,
however, as "infiltrating almost every powerful institution in
Washington, D.C.,"]{.underline} "breaking into major news
organizations," "stealing sensitive military technology," and "stealing
so much intellectual property that China's hacking has been called the
'greatest transfer of wealth in history'" (Fisher, 2013). Drawing in
particular on incendiary words like "stealing" and "infiltrating," [this
article distinguishes China as a sneaky thief. US journalists and
pundits, in charging China with stealing economic resources, have
further solidified the demarcation of China as an inferior and dangerous
Other]{.underline}. A well-circulated quote by national security pundit
Adam Segal stated, "The problem is we're not talking about the same
things ... We're trying to make a distinction between cyber economic
espionage and normal political-military espionage. The Chinese don't
make that same distinction" (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015). By portraying
China as unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between economics
and national security, Segal suggests China's thievery is connected to a
more fundamental character flaw---China is unable to grasp proper
civilized norms. Similarly, US official response has been that China's
view of data collection as a sovereign right has rendered them
essentially different from the United States and by implication, the
civilized world. That Chinese governmental espionage involves the
collection of economic intelligence that is shared with Chinese
companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers, Director
of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they clearly don't
have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that regard"
(Bennett, 2015). Historically, [US depictions of China as uncivilized
have occurred whenever China has gained power or threatened US
interests. The narrative of China as a sort of child following in the
United States' footsteps on the path to modernity]{.underline} has
proven exceedingly popular since World War II and [frames the US
approach to China as a potential ally and resource who at the same time
may never be civilizable]{.underline} (Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012). In
this Orientalist narrative, [China's journey to modernity is always
understood as precarious and, moreover, subject to US vigilance as to
whether it meets the appropriate benchmarks]{.underline}. The title of
an editorial in The Washington Post epitomizes current iterations of
this sentiment and the ease with which [Orientalist imagery can be
invoked to portray China's path to modernity as needing US guidance when
China falls out of line]{.underline}: "The US Needs to Tame the
Cyber-Dragon: Stronger Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic
Espionage \[emphasis mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In
reality, US vigilance can be attributed to the concern since the end of
the Cold War, that a "sleeping giant" able to challenge US global
hegemony is awakening (Kim, 2010). Thus, [the cultural work done by
portrayals of China as unable to adhere to civilized norms serve to
bolster the image of China as perpetually unprepared to be a responsible
member of the international community]{.underline}. In fact, this
narrative of China's thievery serves to persuade the American public
that China is a threat to the international community. One Wall Street
Journal journalist perfectly echoes this sentiment: A China that leads
the world in the theft of intellectual property, computer hacking and
resource nationalism will prove extremely destabilizing. If it continues
on this course, Beijing should not be surprised if other countries begin
to band together to collectively counter some of the more harmful
implications of China's rise. A better outcome for all will be for China
to embrace its responsibilities to help lead the world ... (Metzl, 2011)
[This article]{.underline}, although hopeful that China may at some
future point become a responsible global actor, even leader, [ultimately
reifies the notion that an increase in China's global power is always
suspect.]{.underline}

[China and its relationship with the United States has long been a
fascinating subject of study in the mainstream U.S. international
relations community]{.underline}. This is reflected, for example, in the
current heated debates over whether China is primarily a strategic
threat to or a market bonanza for the United States and whether
containment or engagement is the best way to deal with it.1 [While U.S.
China scholars argue fiercely over \"what China precisely is,\" their
debates have been underpinned by some common ground, especially in terms
of a positivist epistemology]{.underline}. Firstly, [they believe that
China is ultimately a knowable object, whose reality can be, and ought
to be, empirically revealed by scientific means]{.underline}. For
example, after expressing his dissatisfaction with often conflicting
Western perceptions of China, David M. Lampton, former president of the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, suggests that \"[it is time
to step back and look at where China is today, where it might be going,
and what consequences that direction will hold for the rest of the
world.]{.underline}\"2 Like many other China scholars, Lampton views his
object of study as essentially \"something we can stand back from and
observe with clinical detachment.\"3 Secondly, associated with the first
assumption, it is commonly believed that China scholars merely serve as
\"disinterested observers\" Department of Political Science and
International Relations, Faculty of Arts, Australian National
University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia. Chengxin.Pan@anu. edu.au 305
306 The \"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination and that their
studies of China are neutral, passive descriptions of reality. And
thirdly, **[in pondering whether China poses a threat or offers an
opportunity to the United States, they rarely raise the question of
\"what the United States is.\"]{.underline}** That is[, the meaning of
the United States is believed to be certain and beyond
doubt]{.underline}. I do not dismiss altogether the conventional ways of
debating China. It is not the purpose of this article to venture my own
\"observation\" of \"where China is today,\" nor to join the
\"containment\" versus \"engagement\" debate per se. Rather, I want to
contribute to a novel dimension of the China debate by questioning the
seemingly unproblematic assumptions shared by most China scholars in the
mainstream IR community in the United States. To perform this task, I
will focus attention on a particularly significant component of the
China debate; namely, the \"China threat\" literature. More
specifically, I want to argue **[that U.S. conceptions of China as a
threatening other are always intrinsically linked to how U.S.
policymakers/mainstream China specialists see themselves (as
representatives of the indispensable, security-conscious nation, for
example).]{.underline}** As such, **[they are not value-free, objective
descriptions of an independent, preexisting Chinese reality out there,
but are better understood as a kind of normative, meaning-giving
practice that often legitimates power politics in U.S.-China relations
and helps transform the \"China threat\" into social
reality.]{.underline}** In other words, it is self-fulfilling in
practice, and is always part of the \"China threat\" problem it purports
merely to describe. In doing so, I seek to bring to the fore two
interconnected themes of self/other constructions and of theory as
practice inherent in the \"China threat\" literature---themes that have
been overridden and rendered largely invisible by those common
positivist assumptions. These themes are of course nothing new nor
peculiar to the \"China threat\" literature. They have been identified
elsewhere by critics of some conventional fields of study such as
ethnography, anthropology, oriental studies, political science, and
international relations.4 Yet, so far, the China field in the West in
general and the U.S. \"China threat\" literature in particular have
shown remarkable resistance to systematic critical reflection on both
their normative status as discursive practice and their enormous
practical implications for international politics.5 It is in this
context that this article seeks to make a contribution. I begin with a
brief survey of the \"China threat\" argument in contemporary U.S.
international relations literature, followed by an investigation of how
this particular argument about China Chengxin Pan 307 is a discursive
construction of other, which is predicated on the predominant way in
**[which the United States imagines itself as the universal,
indispensable nation-state in constant need of absolute certainty and
security]{.underline}**. Finally, this article will illustrate some of
the dangerous practical consequences of the \"China threat\" discourse
for contemporary U.S.-China relations, particularly with regard to the
1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis and the 2001 spy-plane incident.
[The \"China Threat\" Argument That China constitutes a growing
\"threat\" to the United States is arguably one of the most important
\"discoveries\" by U.S. IR scholars in the post-Cold War era. **For
many, this \"threat\" is obvious for a variety of reasons concerning
economic, military, cultural, and political dimensions.**]{.underline}
First and foremost, **[much of today\'s alarm about the \"rise of
China\" resolves around the phenomenal development of the Chinese
economy during the past twenty-five years: Its overall size has more
than quadrupled since 1978]{.underline}**. China expert Nicholas Lardy
of the Brookings Institution suggested that \"the pace of China\'s
industrial development and trade expansion is unparalleled in modern
economic history.\" He went on: \"While this has led to unprecedented
improvements in Chinese incomes and living standards, it also poses
challenges for other countries.\"6 One such challenge is thought to be
job losses in the United States. A recent study done for a U.S.
congressional panel found that at least 760,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs
have migrated to China since 1992.7 Associated with this economic boom
is China\'s growing trade surplus with the United States, which,
according to Time magazine journalists Richard Bernstein and Ross Munro,
increased nearly tenfold from \$3.5 billion in 1988 to roughly \$33.8
billion in 1995. This trade imbalance, as they put it, is a function of
a Chinese strategy to target certain industries and to undersell
American competition via a system of subsidies and high tariffs. And
[that is why the deficit is harmful to the American economy and likely
to become an area of ever greater conflict in bilateral relations in the
future.8 For many, also frightening is a prospect of the emergence of
socalled \"Greater China\" (a vast economic zone consisting of mainland
China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan).]{.underline} As Harry Harding points out,
\"Although \[Greater China\] was originally intended in \[a\] 3 0 8 The
\"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination benign economic sense,\...
in some quarters it evokes much more aggressive analogies, such as the
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere or Greater Germany.\"9 In this
context, some believe that China\'s economic challenge inevitably gives
rise to a simultaneous military threat. As Denny Roy argues: \"A
stronger, wealthier China would have greater wherewithal to increase its
arsenal of nuclear-armed ICBMs and to increase their lethality through
improvements in range, accuracy, and survivability. If China continues
its rate of economic expansion, absolute growth in Chinese nuclear
capabilities should be expected to increase.\"10 Furthermore, U.S.
Congressman Bob Schaffer claimed that China\'s military buildup, already
under way at an alarming rate, was aimed at the United States.11 In
addition to what they see as a worrying economic and military expansion,
many U.S. China scholars believe that there exist still other dimensions
to the \"China threat\" problem, such as China\'s \"Middle Kingdom\"
mentality, unresolved historical grievances, and an undemocratic
government.12 Warren I. Cohen argues that \"probably the most
ethnocentric people in the world, the Chinese considered their realm the
center of the universe, the Middle Kingdom, and regarded all cultural
differences as signs of inferiority.\"13 As a result[, it is argued, the
outside world has good reason to be concerned that \"China will seek to
reestablish in some form the political and cultural hegemony that it
enjoyed in Asia during the Ming and early Qing
dynasties]{.underline}.\"14 At another level, from a \"democratic
peace\" standpoint, a China under the rule of an authoritarian regime is
predisposed to behave irresponsibly. As Bernstein and Munro put it: If
the history of the last two hundred years is any guide, the more
democratic countries become, the less likely they are to fight wars
against each other. The more dictatorial they are, the more war prone
they become. Indeed, if the current Beijing regime continues to engage
in military adventurism---as it did in the Taiwan Strait in 1996---there
will be a real chance of at least limited naval or air clashes with the
United States.15 Subscribing to the same logic, Denny Roy asserts that
\"the establishment of a liberal democracy in China is extremely
unlikely in the foreseeable future. . . . Without democratization
within, there is no basis for expecting more pacific behavior
without.\"16 However, for other observers, even if China does become
democratized, the threat may still remain. Postulating what he calls the
\"democratic paradox\" phenomenon, Samuel Huntington suggests Chengxin
Pan 309 that democratization is as likely to encourage international
conflict as it is to promote peace.17 Indeed, many China watchers
believe that an increase in market freedom has already led to an upsurge
in Chinese nationalism, the only thing that allegedly provides the glue
to hold contemporary China together.18 It is argued that such
nationalist sentiment, coupled with memories of its past humiliation and
thwarted grandeur, will make China an increasingly dissatisfied,
revisionist power---hence, a threat to the international status quo. t
Furthermore, some point out that what is also troublesome is an
entrenched realpolitik strategic culture in traditional Chinese thought.
Harvard China expert Alastair Iain Johnston, for example, argues that
Chinese strategic culture is dominated by the parabellum (prepare for
war) paradigm. This paradigm believes that warfare is a relatively
constant feature in international relations, that stakes in conflicts
with the adversary are zero-sum in nature, and that the use of force is
the most efficacious means of dealing with threat.19 From this, Warren
Cohen concludes that if Johnston\'s analysis of China\'s strategic
culture is correct---and I believe that it is---generational change will
not guarantee a kinder, gentler China. Nor will the ultimate
disappearance of communism in Beijing. The powerful China we have every
reason to expect in the twenty-first century is likely to be as
aggressive and expansionist as China has been whenever it has been the
dominant power in Asia.20 Apart from these so-called \"domestic\"
reasons for the \"China threat,\" some commentators arrive at a similar
conclusion based on the historical experience of power realignment as a
result of the rise and fall of great powers. China, from this
perspective, is regarded as the most likely candidate to fill the power
vacuum created by the end of U.S.-Soviet rivalry in East Asia. This,
according to Kenneth Lieberthal at the University of Michigan (and
formerly of the U.S. State Department), \"will inevitably present major
challenges to the United States and the rest of the international system
since the perennial question has been how the international community
can accommodate the ambitions of newly powerful states, which have
always forced realignment of the international system and have more
often than not led to war.\"21 For this reason, the rise of China has
often been likened to that of Nazi Germany and militarist Japan on the
eve of the two world wars. For example, Richard K. Betts and Thomas J.
Christensen argue: 310 The \"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination
Like Germany a century ago, China is a late-blooming great power
emerging into a world already ordered strategically by earlier arrivals;
a continental power surrounded by other powers who are collectively
stronger but individually weaker (with the exception of the United
States and, perhaps, Japan) ; a bustling country with great
expectations, dissatisfied with its place in the international pecking
order, if only with regard to international prestige and respect. The
quest for a rightful \"place in the sun\" will, it is argued, inevitably
foster growing friction with Japan, \"• Russia, India or the United
States.22 At this point, it seems there has been enough reason and
empirical evidence for the United States to be vigilant about China\'s
future ambition. While there are debates over the extent to which the
threat is imminent or to which approaches might best explain it, the
\"objective\" quality of such a threat has been taken for granted. In
the words of Walter McDougall, the Pulitzer Prizewinning historian and
strategic thinker at the University of Pennsylvania, recognizing the
\"China threat\" is \"commonsense geopolitics.\"23 For Huntington, the
challenge of \"Greater China\" to the West is simply a rapidly growing
cultural, economic, and political \"reality.\"24 Similarly, when they
claim that \"China can pose a grave problem,\" Betts and Christensen are
convinced that they are merely referring to \"the truth.\"25 In the
following sections, I want to question this \"truth,\" and, more
generally, question the objective, self-evidentiary attitudes that
underpin it. In my view, the \"China threat\" literature is best
understood as a particular kind of discursive practice that dichotomizes
the West and China as self and other. In this sense, the \"truism\" that
China presents a growing threat is not so much an objective reflection
of contemporary global reality, per se, as it is a discursive
construction of otherness that acts to bolster the hegemonic leadership
of the United States in the post-Cold War world. Therefore, to have a
better understanding of how the discursive construction of China as a
\"threat\" takes place, it is now necessary to turn attention to a
particularly dominant way of U.S. self-imagination. The \"China Threat\"
in the American Self-imagination American Self-imagination and the
Construction of Otherness In 1630, John Winthrop, governor of the
British-settled Massachusetts Bay Colony, described the Puritan mission
as a moral beacon Chengxin Pan 311 for the world: \"For wee must
Consider that wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill, the eies \[eyes\] of
all people are uppon us.\"26 Couched in a highly metaphoric manner, the
\"city on the hill\" message greatly galvanized the imagination of early
European settlers in North America who had desperately needed some kind
of certainty and assurance in the face of many initial difficulties and
disappointments in the \"New World.\" Surely there have been numerous
U.S. constructions of \"what we are,\" but this sense of \"manifest
destiny,\" discursively repeated and reconstructed time and again by
leading U.S. politicians, social commentators, the popular press, and
numerous school textbooks, has since become a pivotal part of U.S.
self-consciousness. In 1992, Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, wrote: America is a remarkable nation. We are, as
Abraham Lincoln told Congress in December 1862, a nation that \"cannot
escape history\" because we are \"the last best hope of earth.\" The
president said that his administration and Congress held the \"power and
. . . responsibility\" to ensure that the hope America promised would be
fulfilled. Today . . . America is still the last best hope of earth, and
we still hold the power and bear the responsibility for its remaining
so.27 This sentiment was echoed by Madeleine K. Albright, the former
secretary of state, who once called the United States \"the
indispensable nation\" and maintained that \"we stand tall and hence see
further than other nations.\"28 More recently, speaking of the U.S. role
in the current war on terrorism, Vice President Dick Cheney said: \"Only
we can rally the world in a task of this complexity against an enemy so
elusive and so resourceful. The United States and only the United States
can see this effort through to victory.\"29 It is worth adding that
Cheney, along with several other senior officials in the present Bush
administration, is a founding member of the Project for the New American
Century, a project designed to ensure U.S. security and global dominance
in the twenty-first century. Needless to say, the United States is not
unique in ethnocentric thinking. For centuries, China had assumed it was
the center of the world. But what distinguishes U.S. from Chinese
ethnocentric selfidentities is that while the latter was based largely
on the Confucian legacy, the former is sanctioned by more powerful
regimes of truth, such as Christianity and modern science. For the early
English Puritans, America was part of a divine plan and the settlers
were the Chosen People blessed by covenant with God.30 With the advent
of the scientific age, U.S. exceptionalism began taking on a secular,
scientific dimension. Charles Darwin once argued that \"the 312 The
\"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination wonderful progress of the
United States, as well as the character of the people, are the results
of natural selection.\"31 The United States has since been construed as
the manifestation of the law of nature, with its ideas and institutions
described not as historically particular but as truly universal. For
example, in his second inaugural address in 1917, President Woodrow
Wilson declared that U.S. principles were \"not the principles of a
province or of a single continent. We have known and boasted all along
that they were the principles of a liberated mankind.\"32 In short,
\"The US is utopia achieved.\"33 It represents the \"End of History.\"34
What does this U.S. self-knowledge have to do with the way in which it
comes to know others in general and China in particular? To put it
simply, this self-knowledge is always a powerful analytical framework
within which other societies are to be known. By envisioning a linear
process of historical development with itself at its apex, the United
States places other nations on a common evolutionary slope and sees them
as inevitably traveling toward the end of history that is the United
States. For example, as a vast, ancient nation on the other side of the
Pacific, China is frequently taken as a mirror image of the U.S. self.
As Michael Hunt points out, we imagine ourselves locked in a special
relationship with the Chinese, whose apparent moderation and pragmatism
mirror our own most prized attributes and validate our own longings for
a world made over in our own image. If China with its old and radically
different culture can be won, where can we not prevail?35 Yet, in a
world of diversity, contingency, and unpredictability, which is
irreducible to universal sameness or absolute certainty, this kind of
U.S. knowledge of others often proves frustratingly elusive. In this
context, rather than questioning the validity of their own universalist
assumptions, **[the people of the United States believe that those who
are different should be held responsible for the lack of universal
sameness. Indeed, because \"we\" are universal, those who refuse or who
are unable to become like \"us\" are no longer just \"others,\" but are
by definition the negation of universality, or the other. In this way,
the other is always built into this universalized \"American\" self.
Just as \"Primitive .. . is a category, not an object, of Western
thought]{.underline}**,\"36 so **[the threat of the other is not some
kind of \"external reality\" discovered by U.S. strategic analysts, but
a ready-made category of thought within this particular way of U.S.
self-imagination]{.underline}**. Consequently, there is always a need
for the United States to find a specific other to fill into the
totalized category of otherness. Chengxin Pan 313 In the early days of
American history, it was Europe, or the \"Old World,\" that was invoked
as its primary other, threatening to corrupt the \"New World.\"37
Shortly after World War II, in the eyes of U.S. strategists, the Soviet
Union emerged as a major deviance from, hence an archenemy of, their
universal path toward progress via the free market and liberal
democracy. And after the demise of the Soviet Union, the vacancy of
other was to be filled by China, the \"best candidate\" the United
States could find in the post-Cold War, unipolar world. Not until the
September 11 attacks in New York and Washington had China\'s candidature
been suspended, to be replaced by international terrorism in general and
Saddam\'s Iraq in particular.38 At first glance, as the \"China threat\"
literature has told us, China seems to fall perfectly into the
\"threat\" category, particularly given its growing power. However,
China\'s power as such does not speak for itself in terms of an emerging
threat. By any reasonable measure, China remains a largely poor country
edged with only a sliver of affluence along its coastal areas. Nor is
China\'s sheer size a self-evident confirmation of the \"China threat\"
thesis, as other countries like India, Brazil, and Australia are almost
as big as China. Instead, China as a \"threat\" has much to do with the
particular mode of U.S. self-imagination. As Steve Chan notes: China is
an object of attention not only because of its huge size, ancient
legacy, or current or projected relative national power. . . . The
importance of China has to do with perceptions, especially those
regarding the potential that Beijing will become an example, source, or
model that contradicts Western liberalism as the reigning paradigm. In
an era of supposed universalizing cosmopolitanism, China demonstrates
the potency and persistence of nationalism, and embodies an alternative
to Western and especially U.S. conceptions of democracy and capitalism.
China is a reminder that history is not close to an end.39 Certainly, I
do not deny China\'s potential for strategic misbehavior in the global
context, nor do I claim the \"essential peacefulness\" of Chinese
culture.40 Having said that, my main point here is that there is no such
thing as \"Chinese reality\" that can automatically speak for itself,
for example, as a \"threat.\" Rather, the \"China threat\" is
essentially a specifically social meaning given to China by its U.S.
observers, a meaning that cannot be disconnected from the dominant U.S.
self-construction. Thus, to fully understand the U.S. \"China threat\"
argument, it is essential to recognize its autobiographical nature. 314
The \"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination Indeed, the
construction of other is not only a product of U.S. self-imagination,
but often a necessary foil to it. For example, by taking this particular
representation of China as Chinese reality per se, those scholars are
able to assert their self-identity as \"mature,\" \"rational\" realists
capable of knowing the \"hard facts\" of international politics, in
distinction from those \"idealists\" whose views are said to be grounded
more in \"an article of faith\" than in \"historical experience.\"41 On
the other hand, given that history is apparently not \"progressively\"
linear, the invocation of a certain other not only helps explain away
such historical uncertainties or \"anomalies\" and maintain the
credibility of the allegedly universal path trodden by the United
States, but also serves to highlight U.S. \"indispensability.\" As
Samuel Huntington puts it, \"[If being an American means being committed
to the principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private
property, and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those
principles, what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes
of American national interests?\"]{.underline}42 In this way, **[it
seems that the constructions of the particular U.S. self and its other
are always intertwined and mutually reinforcing]{.underline}**. Some may
suggest that there is nothing particularly wrong with this since
psychologists generally agree that \"individuals and groups define their
identity by differentiating themselves from and placing themselves in
opposition to others.\"43 This is perhaps true. As the Swiss linguist
Ferdinand de Saussure tells us, meaning itself depends on difference and
differentiation.44 Yet[, to understand the U.S. dichotomized
constructions of self/other in this light is to normalize them and
render them unproblematic]{.underline}, because it is also apparent that
not all identity-defining practices necessarily perceive others in terms
of either universal sameness or absolute otherness and that difference
need not equate to threat. The Discursive Construction of China as Other
in the \"China Threat\" Literature Having examined how the \"China
threat\" literature is enabled by and serves the purpose of a particular
U.S. self-construction, I want to turn now to the issue of how this
literature represents a discursive construction of other, instead of an
\"objective\" account of Chinese reality. This, I argue, has less to do
with its portrayal of China as a threat per se than with its
essentialization and totalization of China as an externally knowable
object, independent of historically contingent contexts or dynamic
international interactions. In this sense, **[the discursive
construction of China as a threatening other cannot be detached from
(neo) realism, a positivist]{.underline}**, Chengxin Pan 315
**[ahistorical framework of analysis within which global life is reduced
to endless interstate rivalry for power and survival]{.underline}**.
**[As many critical IR scholars have noted, (neo)realism is not a
transcendent description of global reality but is predicated on the
modernist Western identity, which, in the quest for scientific
certainty, has come to define itself essentially as the sovereign
territorial nation-state]{.underline}**. [This realist self-identity of
Western states leads to the constitution of anarchy as the sphere of
insecurity, disorder, and war.]{.underline} In an anarchical system, as
(neo) realists argue, \"the gain of one side is often considered to be
the loss of the other,\"45 and \"All other states are potential
threats.\"46 In order to survive in such a system, states inevitably
pursue power or capability. In doing so, these realist claims represent
what R. B. J. Walker calls \"a specific historical articulation of
relations of universality/particularity and self/O then\"47 The (neo)
realist paradigm has dominated the U.S. IR discipline in general and the
U.S. China studies field in particular. As Kurt Campbell notes, after
the end of the Cold War, a whole new crop of China experts \"are much
more likely to have a background in strategic studies or international
relations than China itself.\"48 As a result, for those experts to know
China is nothing more or less than to undertake a geopolitical analysis
of it, often by asking only a few questions such as how China will
\"behave\" in a strategic sense and how it may affect the regional or
global balance of power, with a particular emphasis on China\'s military
power or capabilities. As Thomas J. Christensen notes, \"Although many
have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, [the most prevalent
component of the \[China threat\] debate is the assessment of China\'s
overall future military power compared with that of the United States
and other East Asian regional powers.\"49 Consequently, almost by
default, China emerges as an absolute other and a threat thanks to this
(neo) realist prism. The (neo) realist emphasis on survival and security
in international relations dovetails perfectly with the U.S.
self-imagination, because for the United States to define itself as the
indispensable nation in a world of anarchy is often to demand absolute
security]{.underline}. As James Chace and Caleb Carr note, \"for over
two centuries the aspiration toward an eventual condition of absolute
security has been viewed as central to an effective American foreign
policy.\"50 And this self-identification in turn leads to the definition
of not only \"tangible\" foreign powers but global contingency and
uncertainty per se as threats. For example, former U.S. President George
H. W. Bush repeatedly said that \"the enemy \[of America\] is
unpredictability. The enemy is instability.\"51 Similarly, arguing for
the continuation of U.S. Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon
official asked, \"if we pull out, who knows what nervousness will
result?\"52 316 The \"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination Thus
understood, by its very uncertain character, China would now
automatically constitute a threat to the United States. For example,
Bernstein and Munro believe that \"China\'s political unpredictability,
the always-present possibility that it will fall into a state of
domestic disunion and factional fighting,\" constitutes a source of
danger.53 In like manner, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen write: If
the PIA \[People\'s Liberation Army\] remains second-rate, should the
world breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely. . . . Drawing China into
the web of global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than
war, but it cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political
interests will be blocked by a fear of economic consequences. . . .
**[U.S. efforts to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait
might deter the use of force under certain circumstances, but certainly
not all]{.underline}**.54 The upshot, therefore, is that since China
displays no absolute certainty for peace, it must be, by definition, an
uncertainty, and hence, a threat. In the same way, a multitude of other
unpredictable factors (such as ethnic rivalry, local insurgencies,
overpopulation, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, rogue
states, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and international
terrorism) have also been labeled as \"threats\" to U.S. security. Yet,
it seems that in the post-Cold War environment, China represents a kind
of uncertainty par excellence. \"Whatever the prospects for a more
peaceful, more democratic, and more just world order, nothing seems more
uncertain today than the future of post-Deng China,\"55 argues Samuel
Kim. And such an archetypical uncertainty is crucial to the enterprise
of U.S. self-construction, because it seems that only an uncertainty
with potentially global consequences such as China could justify U.S.
indispensability or its continued world dominance. In this sense, Bruce
Cumings aptly suggested in 1996 that China \^as a threat) was basically
\"a metaphor for an enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its
bearings and that requires a formidable \'renegade state\' to define its
mission (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks necessary weights).\"56
It is mainly on the basis of this self-fashioning that many U.S.
scholars have for long claimed their \"expertise\" on China. For
example, from his observation (presumably on Western TV networks) of the
Chinese protest against the U.S. bombing of their embassy in Belgrade in
May 1999, Robert Kagan is confident enough to speak on behalf of the
whole Chinese people, claiming Chengxin Pan 317 that he knows \"the
fact\" of \"what \[China\] really thinks about the United States.\" That
is, \"they consider the United States an enemy--- or, more precisely,
the enemy. . . . How else can one interpret the Chinese government\'s
response to the bombing?\" he asks, rhetorically.57 For Kagan, because
the Chinese \"have no other information\" than their government\'s
propaganda, the protesters cannot rationally \"know\" the whole event as
\"we\" do. Thus, their anger must have been orchestrated, unreal, and
hence need not be taken seriously.58 Given that Kagan heads the U.S.
Leadership Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and
is very much at the heart of redefining the United States as the
benevolent global hegemon, his confidence in speaking for the Chinese
\"other\" is perhaps not surprising. In a similar vein, without
producing in-depth analysis, Bernstein and Munro invoke with great ease
such all-encompassing notions as \"the Chinese tradition\" and its
\"entire three-thousandyear history.\"59 In particular, they repeatedly
speak of what China\'s \"real\" goal is: \"China is an unsatisfied and
ambitious power whose goal is to dominate Asia. . . . China aims at
achieving a kind of hegemony. . . . China is so big and so naturally
powerful that \[we know\] it will tend to dominate its region even if it
does not intend to do so as a matter of national policy.\"60 Likewise,
with the goal of absolute security for the United States in mind,
Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen argue: The truth is that China can
pose a grave problem even if it does not become a military power on the
American model, does not intend to commit aggression, integrates into a
global economy, and liberalizes politically. Similarly, the United
States could face a dangerous conflict over Taiwan even if it turns out
that Beijing lacks the capacity to conquer the island. . . . This is
true because of geography; because of America\'s reliance on alliances
to project power; and because of China\'s capacity to harm U.S. forces,
U.S. regional allies, and the American homeland, even while losing a war
in the technical, military sense.61 By now, it seems clear that neither
China\'s capabilities nor intentions really matter. Rather, almost by
its mere geographical existence, China has been qualified as an absolute
strategic \"other,\" a discursive construct from which it cannot escape.
Because of this, \"China\" in U.S. IR discourse has been objectified and
deprived of its own subjectivity and exists mainly in and for the U.S.
self. Little wonder that for many U.S. China specialists, China becomes
merely a \"national security concern\" for the United States, with the
\"severe 318 The \"China Threat\" in American Self-Imagination
disproportion between the keen attention to China as a security concern
and the intractable neglect of China\'s \[own\] security concerns in the
current debate.\"62 At this point, at issue here is no longer whether
the \"China threat\" argument is true or false, but is rather its
reflection of a shared positivist mentality among mainstream China
experts that they know China better than do the Chinese themselves.63
\"We\" alone can know for sure that they consider \"us\" their enemy and
thus pose a menace to \"us.\" Such an account of China, in many ways,
strongly seems to resemble Orientalists\' problematic distinction
between the West and the Orient. Like orientalism, the U.S. construction
of the Chinese \"other\" does not require that China acknowledge the
validity of that dichotomous construction. Indeed, as Edward Said point
out, \"It is enough for \'us\' to set up these distinctions in our own
minds; \[and\] \'they\' become \'they\' accordingly.\"64 It may be the
case that there is nothing inherently wrong with perceiving others
through one\'s own subjective lens. Yet, what is problematic with
mainstream U.S. China watchers is that they refuse to acknowledge the
legitimacy of the inherent fluidity of Chinese identity and subjectivity
and try instead to fix its ambiguity as absolute difference from \"us,\"
a kind of certainty that denotes nothing but otherness and threats. As a
result, it [becomes difficult to find a legitimate space for alternative
ways of understanding an inherently volatile, amorphous China65 or to
recognize that China\'s future trajectory in global politics is
contingent essentially on how \"we\" in the United States and the West
in general want to see it as well as on how the Chinese choose to shape
it.66 Indeed, discourses of \"us\" and \"them\" are always closely
linked to how \"we\" as \"what we are\" deal with \"them\" as \"what
they are\" in the practical realm. This is exactly how the discursive
strategy of perceiving China as a threatening other should be
understood, a point addressed in the following section, which explores
some of the practical dimension of this discursive strategy in the
containment perspectives and hegemonic ambitions of U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} The \"China Threat\" Discourse and the New U.S.
Containment Policy [The discursive construction of the U.S. self and the
\"Chinese threat\" argument are not innocent, descriptive accounts of
some \"independent\" reality.]{.underline} Rather, they are always a
clarion call for the practice of power politics. At the apex of this
power-politics agenda Chengxin Pan 319 is the politico-strategic
question of \"what is to be done\" to make the United States secure from
the (perceived) threats it faces. At a general level, as Benjamin
Schwarz proposes, this requires an unhindered path to U.S. global
hegemony that means not only that the United States must dominate
wealthy and technologically sophisticated states in Europe and East
Asia--- America\'s \"allies\"---but also that it must deal with such
nuisances as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic and Kim Jong II, so that
potential great powers need not acquire the means to deal with those
problems themselves. And those powers that eschew American
supervision---such as China---must be both engaged and . contained. The
upshot of \"American leadership\" is that the United States must spend
nearly as much on national security as the rest of the world combined.67
This \"neocontainment\" policy has been echoed in the \"China threat\"
literature. In a short yet decisive article titled \"Why We Must Contain
China,\" Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer insists that
\"containing China\" and \"undermining its ruthless dictatorship\"
constitute two essential components of \"any rational policy toward a
rising, threatening China.\" Not only is a policy other than containment
considered irrational, but even a delay to implement it would be
undesirable, as he urges that \"containment of such a bully must begin
early in its career.\" To this end, Krauthammer offers such
\"practical\" options as strengthening regional alliances (with Vietnam,
India, and Russia, as well as Japan) to box in China; standing by
Chinese dissidents; denying Beijing the right to host the Olympics; and
keeping China from joining the World Trade Organization on the terms it
desires.68 Containing China is of course not the only option arising
from the \"China threat\" literature. More often than not, there is a
subtle, business-style \"crisis management\" policy. For example,
Bernstein and Munro shy away from the word containment, preferring to
call their China policy management.69 Yet, what remains unchanged in the
management formula is a continued promotion of controlling China. For
instance, a perusal of Bernstein and Munro\'s texts reveals that what
they mean by management is no different than Krauthammer\'s explicit
containment stance.70 By framing U.S.­ China relations as an issue of
\"crisis management,\" they leave little doubt of who is the \"manager\"
and who is to be \"managed.\" In a more straightforward manner, Betts
and Christensen state that coercion and war must be part and parcel of
the China management policy: 320 The \"China Threat\" in American
Self-Imagination In addressing the China challenge, the United States
needs to think hard about three related questions: first, how to avoid
crises and war through prudent, coercive diplomacy; second, how to
manage crises and fight a war if the avoidance effort fails; third, how
to end crises and terminate war at costs acceptable to the United States
and its allies.71 This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives
outlined above will automatically be translated into actual China
policy, but one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that
the \"China threat\" perspective does exert enormous influence on U.S.
policy making on China. To illustrate this point, I want now to examine
some specific implications of U.S. representations of the \"China
threat\" for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan
Strait missile crisis and the \"spy plane\" incident of 2001. Theory as
Practice 1: The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis In the eyes of many U.S.
China watchers, China\'s approach to the Taiwan question is a microcosm
of its grand strategy to dominate Asia. The argument is that nowhere is
the threatening ambition more palpable than in China\'s saber-rattling
missile tests near Taiwan\'s coast in 1995-1996, in addition to its
long-standing refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to
settle the dispute.72 While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has been a
favorite \"starting point\" for many pundits and practitioners to paint
a frightening picture of China and to justify U.S. firm response to it,
what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the \"China
threat\" discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up
to that crisis. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue
here. Simply put, the Taiwan question was created largely as a result of
widespread U.S. perceptions of China as a \"Red Menace\" in the wake of
the \"loss of China\" and the outbreak of the Korean War. To thwart what
it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the United States
deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold
War containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the
reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the United States
abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s
and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the
conventional image of the \"Red Menace\" lingered on in the United
States. To manage such a \"threat,\" the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan
Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations,
renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan\'s defense even though diplomatic
ties with the island had been severed.73 Chengxin Pan 321 This
confrontational policy serves not only to shore up Taiwan\'s defense
capabilities but also to induce its independent ambition and further
complicate cross-strait relations. As former U.S. defense official Chas
Freeman remarked, \"U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work to boost
Taipei\'s confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing.
Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own way.\"74 For
instance, amid growing sympathy from the Republican-dominated Congress
and the elite media as well as the expanded ties with the United States,
Taiwan responded coolly to Beijing\'s call for dialogue in January 1995.
In June 1995, Taiwan\'s flexible diplomacy, designed to burnish its
independent image, culminated in its president Lee Teng-hui\'s
high-profile visit to the United States. This in turn reinforced
Beijing\'s suspicion that the real U.S. intention was to frustrate its
reunification goal, leaving it apparently no other choice but to prepare
militarily for what it saw as a worst-case scenario. All this
constituted the major context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait
missile exercises took place. For most Chinese, the carrying out of
these military exercises, well within their own territory, had little to
do with attacking Taiwan, much less with challenging U.S. security
interests in the western Pacific. Rather, it was about China\'s
long-cherished dream of national unity, with its \"sabre rattling\"
tactics serving merely as a warning to the United States, as well as to
Taiwan. However, interpreting such exercises as China\'s muscle-flexing
with direct security implications for the region, with \"an almost
19th-century display of gunboat diplomacy,\"75 the United States
dispatched two nuclearpowered aircraft carriers to the region of Taiwan.
While not denying the potential security repercussions of China\'s
missile tests for the region, I suggest that the flashpoint of Taiwan
says as much about the danger of this U.S. approach to China as about
the threat of Beijing\'s display of force itself. \"Had Bill Clinton
projected a constancy of purpose and vision in China policy .. . in
1993-1994,\" David M. Lampton argues, \"he might not have been
challenged in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996 with missile exercises.\"76
Indeed, it was primarily in the context of this U.S. intervention that
Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can say no), one of the most anti-U.S.
books ever produced in China, emerged and quickly became a best-seller
in the Chinese reading world.77 Meanwhile, some Chinese strategic
thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show of strength that they told
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger\'s close associates, that
they were rereading the early works of George F. Kennan because
\"containment had been the basis of American policy toward the Soviet
Union; now that the United States was turning containment against China,
they wanted to learn how it had started and evolved.\"78 322 The \"China
Threat\" in American Self-Imagination If such a scary interaction
between the United States and China remained somehow obscured here, it
would soon be manifested again in another standoff in U.S.-China
relations; namely, the spyplane incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 2:
The 2001 Spy-Plane Incident Following the 1995-1996 missile crisis,
mainstream China observers have continued to take the Taiwan question as
a purely geopolitical or security issue, which accordingly should be
understood and dealt with simply from the time-honored balance-of-power,
zero-sum game perspectives. For example, Bernstein and Munro insist that
Taiwan\'s reunification with the mainland \"will leave China in
possession of yet another immense economic prize. . . . Complete Chinese
reunification, in other words, would further upset the balance of power
and vastly enhance China\'s economic and strategic strength.\"79
Commenting on this typical way of representing the Taiwan question, the
Taiwan-based scholar Chih-yu Shih suggests that the national security
analysis may seem to be a more tangible approach to dissecting the
rationale behind Beijing\'s \"policy of coercion\" and, because it
appears sensible to us, can alleviate our need to pursue Beijing\'s
motivations more deeply. Not only can we thus camouflage our
embarrassment at not really knowing China, but also Beijing\'s
discomforting behavioural patterns become comfortably familiar.80
Clearly, the practical implications of this kind of representation go
far beyond that. After perceiving a power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait
in favor of China, James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) and
Carl Ford proposed: \"The name of the game for Taiwan, then, is
deterrence,\" which means that the United States must help Taiwan\'s
military maintain \"a qualitative edge over the PRC.\"8i The 2002 Report
to Congress of the U.S.-China Security Review Commission reached similar
conclusions, recommending, among other things, \"deterring China
attacking Taiwan\" and \"supporting Taiwan\'s ability to defend itself
without outside assistance.\" In its formal conclusion, the review
commission, made up of well-known U.S. China experts as well as
influential policymakers, vows to continue monitoring China in every
aspect relating to \"our national security concerns.\"82 In fact, U.S.
monitoring activity, such as conducting reconnaissance flights along
Chinese borders, had always been part of its China policy. So went the
rationale: Chengxin Pan 323 The Chinese say they have the right to use
force to reclaim Taiwan because it belongs to them, and they regularly
practice for an invasion. This threat of force is why on April 1st
\[2001\], the U.S. Navy\'s EP-3 surveillance plane was in the area to
monitor China\'s military preparations.83 Yet it turned out that the
EP-3 spy plane collided with a Chinese navy fighter jet that was tailing
it over the South China Sea, some fifty miles from the coast of China\'s
Hainan Province. The Chinese jet crashed into the waters below, while
the crippled spy plane landed on Hainan island. Washington demanded
immediate return of its crew and plane, while Beijing insisted that the
United States bear the responsibility for the midair collision and
apologize for the incident. Rather than reflecting on how their new
containment policy might have contributed to this incident in the first
place, many U.S. realist analysts hastily interpreted it as further
objective proof of the long-suspected \"China threat.\" As Allen S.
Whiting put it, the collision \"focused attention anew on Beijing\'s
willingness to risk the use of force in pursuit of political
objectives.\"84 It was as if the whole incident had little to do with
U.S. spying, which was seen as \"routine\" and \"normal.\" Instead, it
was the Chinese who were said to be \"playing a dangerous game,\"
without regard to the old spy etiquette formulated during the Cold
War.85 For other observers, China\'s otherness was embodied also in its
demand for a U.S. apology. For example, Merle Goldman, a history
professor at Boston University, said that the Chinese emphasis on
apologies was rooted in the Confucian value system: \"This kind of
internalized consensus was the way China was ruled for thousands of
years.\"86 From this perspective, China\'s request for an apology was
preordained by a fixed Chinese tradition and national psyche and had
nothing whatsoever to do with the specific context of this incident in
which China was spied on, its sovereignty violated, and one of its
pilots lost. Thus, even in the face of such a potentially explosive
incident, the self-fulfilling effect of the \"China threat\" discourse
has not been acknowledged by mainstream U.S. China analysts. To the
contrary, deterring and containing China has gained new urgency. For
example, in the aftermath of this standoff, neoconservative columnists
Robert Kagan and William Kristol (chairman of the Project for the New
American Century) wrote that \"not only is the sale of Aegis \[to
Taiwan\] . . . the only appropriate response to Chinese behavior; We
have been calling for the active containment of China for the past six
years precisely because we think it is the only way to 3 2 4 The \"China
Threat\" in American Self-Imagination keep the peace.\"87 Although the
sale of the Aegis destroyers was deferred, President George W. Bush
approved an arms package for Taiwan that included so-called
\"defensive\" weapons such as four Kidd class destroyers, eight diesel
submarines, and twelve P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft, as well as
minesweeping helicopters, torpedoes, and amphibious assault vehicles. On
this arms sale, David Shambaugh, a Washington-based China specialist,
had this to say: \"Given the tangible threats that the Chinese military
can present to Taiwan---particularly a naval blockade or quarantine and
missile threats---this is a sensible and timely package.\"88 Given the
danger and high stakes involved, some may wonder why China did not
simply cooperate so that there would be no need for U.S.
\"containment.\" To some extent, China has been cooperative. For
example, Beijing was at pains to calm a disgruntled Chinese public by
explaining that the U.S. \"sorry\" letter issued at the end of the
spy-plane incident was a genuine \"apology,\" with U.S. officials openly
rejecting that interpretation. On the Taiwan question, China has dropped
many of its previous demands (such as \"one China\" being defined as the
People\'s Republic). As to the South China Sea, China has allowed the
ASEAN Regional Forum to seek a negotiated solution to the Spratly
Islands dispute and also agreed to join the Philippines as cochairs of
the working group on confidence-building measures.89 In January 2002,
China chose to play down an incident that a presidential jet outfitted
in the United States had been crammed with sophisticated
satellite-operated bugs, a decision that, as the New York Times puts it,
\"illustrates the depth of China\'s current commitment to cultivating
better relations with the United States.\"90 Also, over the years, China
has ratified a number of key nonproliferation treaties and pledged not
to assist countries in developing missiles with ranges that exceed the
limits established under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
More recently, China has collaborated with the United States in the war
on terrorism, including issuing new regulations to restrict the export
of missile technology to countries usually accused by the United States
of aiding terrorists. Indeed, as some have argued, by any reasonable
measure China is now more responsible in international affairs than at
any time since 1949.91 And yet, the real problem is that, so long as the
United States continues to stake its self-identity on the realization of
absolute security, no amount of Chinese cooperation would be enough. For
instance, Iain Johnston views the constructive development of China\'s
arms-control policy as a kind of \"realpolitik adaptation,\" rather than
\"genuine learning.\"92 From this perspective, however Chengxin Pan 325
China has changed, it would remain a fundamentally threatening other,
which the United States cannot live with but has to take full control
of. I have argued above that the \"China threat\" argument in mainstream
U.S. IR literature is derived, primarily, from a discursive construction
of otherness. This construction is predicated on a particular
narcissistic understanding of the U.S. self and on a positivist-based
realism, concerned with absolute certainty and security, a concern
central to the dominant U.S. self-imaginary. Within these frameworks, it
seems imperative that China be treated as a threatening, absolute other
since it is unable to fit neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme
or guarantee absolute security for the United States, so that U.S. power
preponderance in the post-Cold War world can still be legitimated. Not
only does this reductionist representation come at the expense of
understanding China as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it leads
inevitably to a policy of containment that, in turn, tends to enhance
the influence of realpolitik thinking, nationalist extremism, and
hard-line stance in today\'s China. Even a small dose of the containment
strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on U.S.-China
relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001 spy-plane
incident have vividly attested. In this respect, Chalmers Johnson is
right when he suggests that \"a policy of containment toward China
implies the possibility of war, just as it did during the Cold War
vis-à-vis the former Soviet Union. The balance of terror prevented war
between the United States and the Soviet Union, but this may not work in
the case of China.\"93 For instance, as the United States presses ahead
with a missiledefence shield to \"guarantee\" its invulnerability from
rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost certain
to intensify China\'s sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its
current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its
limited deterrence. In consequence, it is not impossible that the two
countries, and possibly the whole region, might be dragged into an
escalating arms race that would eventually make war more likely. Neither
the United States nor China is likely to be keen on fighting the other.
But as has been demonstrated, [the \"China threat\" argument, for all
its alleged desire for peace and security, tends to make war
preparedness the most \"realistic\" option for both sides.]{.underline}
At this juncture, worthy of note is an interesting comment made by
Charlie Neuhauser, a leading CIA China specialist, 326 The \"China
Threat\" in American Self-Imagination on the Vietnam War, a war fought
by the United States to contain the then-Communist \"other.\" Neuhauser
says, \"Nobody wants it. We don\'t want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn\'t want
it; it\'s simply a question of annoying the other side.\"94 And, as we
know, in an unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the
United States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and
children lost their lives. Therefore, to call for a halt to the vicious
circle of theory as practice associated with the \"China threat\"
literature, tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR
scholarship on China is no longer adequate. Rather, [what is needed is
to question this un-self-reflective scholarship itself, particularly its
connections with the dominant way in which the United States and the
West in general represent themselves and others via their positivist
epistemology, so that alternative, more nuanced, and less dangerous ways
of interpreting and debating China might become possible.]{.underline}

**[Russia]{.underline}**

**Fear of loose nukes circulates a Cold War discourse of Russian threat
and inferiority**

**FROST 2005** (Robin, teaches political science at Simon Fraser
University, British Colombia, "Nuclear Terrorism after 9/11," Adelphi
Papers, December)

In general, at least some of the [concern about loose Russian weapons
may stem from an unconscious but pervasive belief that Russians cannot
possibly be as responsible and effective as the Americans, the French,
or the British in safeguarding their nuclear arsenal, an attitude
reminiscent of the demonising mythology of the Cold War, which
simultaneously exaggereated the capabilities of the Soviet military,
while denigrating the professionalism and competence of its
members]{.underline}. Granted, with the near-collapse of the Russian
state there was indeed a severe rise in criminality that did not exclude
the armed forces, and which persists to this day. However, [it is one
thing to acknowledge disorder in a society simultaneously released from
decades of authoritarian rule and subjected to the severe stress of
economic failure; it is another altogether to allege a general abeyance
of morality]{.underline}. Consider this excerpt from a RAND Corporation
briefing paper on nuclear terrorism, which discussed the Japanese sect
Aum Shinrikyo's failure to obtain nuclear weapons or technology from
Russia: 'even enterprising Russian officials and scientists may have
feared the implications of transferring nuclear technology, knowledge,
or material to a religious organization based in a foreign state...Aum's
contacts may have been good, but not good enough to secure the transfer
of such sensitive capabilities' (emphasis added). [The default
assumptions appear to have been that 'enterprising Russians' might
normally have been expected to transfer nuclear weapons or technology to
an apocalyptic religious cult without considering the consequences (in
other words, that they would have lacked ordinary standards of morality
and responsibility]{.underline}); that there most likely were people in
positions to do so who would indeed have handed nuclear weapons over to
a cult, if only its contacts had been good enough; and that [evidence to
the contrary was worthy of special note, to be expressed in a tone of
faint but distinct surprise]{.underline}.

[Ever since the Cold War ended, Western officials and commentators have
been telling the Russians how they need to grow out of their Cold War
attitudes toward the West and Western institutions, and learn to see
things in a \"modern\" and \"normal\" way]{.underline}. And there is a
good deal of truth in this. At the same time, [it would have been good
if we had subjected our own inherited attitudes toward Russia to a more
rigorous scrutiny. For like any other inherited hatred, blind, dogmatic
hostility toward Russia leads to bad policies, bad journalism, and the
corruption of honest debate-and there is all too much of this hatred in
Western portrayals of and comments on Russia]{.underline}. From this
point of view, an analysis of [Russophobia has implications that go far
beyond Russia. Much of the U.S. foreign policy debate]{.underline},
especially on the Republican side, [is structured around the belief that
American policy should be rooted in a robust defense of national
interest-and this is probably also the belief of most ordinary
Americans]{.underline}. However, this straightforward view coexists with
another, equally widespread, view that dominates the media. It is, in
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\'s words, that \"the United States
stands taller than other nations, and therefore sees further.\" [The
unspoken assumption here is that America is not only wise but also
objective]{.underline}, at least in its perceptions: that U.S. policy is
influenced by values, but never by national prejudices. The assumption
behind much American (and Western) reporting of foreign conflicts is
that the writer is morally engaged but ethnically uncommitted and able
to turn a benign, all-seeing eye from above on the squabbles of
humanity. [It is impossible to exaggerate how irritating this attitude
is elsewhere in the world, or how misleading and dangerous it is for
Western audiences who believe it. Not only does it contribute to
mistaken policies, but it renders both policymakers and ordinary
citizens incapable of understanding the opposition of other nations to
those policies. Concerning the Middle East, it seems likely that most
Americans genuinely believe that the United States is a neutral and
objective broker]{.underline} in relations between Israelis and
Palestinians-[which can only appear to an Arab as an almost
fantastically bad joke. This belief makes it much more difficult for
Americans to comprehend the reasons for]{.underline} Palestinian and
[Arab fury at]{.underline} both [the United States]{.underline} and
Israel. [It encourages a Western interpretation of this anger as the
manipulation of sheep-like masses by elites. At worst, it can encourage
a kind of racism, in which certain nations are classed as irrationally,
irredeemably savage and wicked]{.underline}

An example of how [blind hostility toward Russia-and the absence of any
comparison to other postcolonial situationscan warp Western
reporting]{.underline} may be seen in the following passage from the
Economist of last September: \"Russia may be using still dodgier tactics
elsewhere. Uzbekistan, an autocratically run and independent-minded
country in Central Asia, is facing a mysterious Islamic insurgency. Its
president, Islam Karimov, said crossly this week that Russia was
exaggerating the threat, and was trying to intimidate his country into
accepting Russian bases.\"15 As Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said,
\"[Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own
facts]{.underline}.\" I do not know of a single shred of evidence or the
testimony of a single reputable expert to support this insinuation,
which is in any case counterintuitive, given the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan\'s links to Russia\'s most bitter enemies. It is a passage
reminiscent of the baroque Russian conspiracy theories suggesting, among
other things, that the CIA is actually behind the terrorist Osama bin
Laden.16 Instead, we would do better to listen to Owen Harries, editor
of the National Interest, a conservative who was a tough anticommunist
and is certainly no Russophile: \"[During the Cold War, a struggle
against what was truly an evil empire, there was some justification in
maintaining that similar behavior by Washington and Moscow should be
judged differently, because the intrinsic moral character of the two
actors was so different. But that was due less to the unique virtues of
the United States than to the special vileness of the Soviet Union, and
even then applying double standards was a tricky business, easily
abused. In the more mundane world of today there is no justification for
applying one standard to the rest of the world and another to America.
Not only does insistence on double standards seem hypocritical to
others, thereby diminishing American credibility and prestige, but even
more seriously, it makes it impossible to think sensibly and coherently
about international affairs. And that is a fatal drawback for an
indispensable nation]{.underline}.\"17 Hatred of Soviet communism helped
take me to Afghanistan in 1988 as a journalist covering the war from the
side of the anti-Soviet resistance, and then to the Baltic States and
the Caucasus in 1990. In the 1970s and 1980s, I was prepared to justify
nasty Western crimes as a regrettable part of the struggle against
communism. But I never pretended these crimes did not occur, or that the
reasons for them did not include a good measure of crude traditional
national power politics. [The Cold War was a profoundly necessary
struggle, but it was also one in which Western morality suffered and
Western soldiers on occasion behaved badly]{.underline}. Westerners
greeted their qualified but peaceful victory with overwhelming joy and
relief. Ten years after the end of the Cold War, it is time to liberate
ourselves from Cold War attitudes and to remember that whether as
journalists or academics, [our first duty is not to spread propaganda

While [the concept of [orientalism]{.mark} propounded by Edward Said has
inspired constructive debate, it [may have inhibited scholarship in
cultural and area studies that is useful to
policy-makers]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, Said\'s ideas may also
offer promising new avenues for US foreign policy and public diplomacy.
By successfully depicting all existing approaches to studying Middle
Eastern and other non-Western societies as premised on \'orientalism\'[,
[Said forced scholars to be more cautious and rigorous in how they
analysed and understood these groups]{.underline}.]{.mark} This approach
has profoundly changed the way Western states deal with the non-Western
world. [[The last three decades have revolutionised the Western view of
other peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark} Until the 1960s scholars
unselfconsciously described Middle Eastern peoples as \'oriental\', an
appellation with a variety of implications. [[This view is now
untenable]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the demise of this perspective
has had important effects on the US policy-making process. The
orientalist view drove policy and diplomacy for much of the last
century. It sat comfortably with the colonialist assumptions that
Western societies struggled to reassert after the Second World War.
However, this perspective eventually collapsed as peoples rebelled
against and overthrew colonial powers. [[Despite repeatedly condemning
colonialism, the United States frequently suffered the \'colonialist\'
label]{.underline}]{.mark}. Washington\'s leadership in the struggle
against the Communist bloc did little to dilute this characterisation by
the Left. Western states confront the challenge of better understanding
non-Western societies, while avoiding charges of paternalistic
orientalism and \'imperialism\'. Certainly the latter charge is
inaccurate. [However[, erasing colonial era influences requires an
inter-generational change in attitudes]{.mark}. Much is being done to
alleviate these feelings through exchange programmes. [The forces
driving divisions between Western states and states in which non-Western
values are dominant derive in part from enduring legacies of the
colonial era. Acknowledging this context, and accounting for it in the
policy-making process, could help alleviate deep-seated resentment of
the West in certain societies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In other words, [[Orientalism]{.mark} was around far before the modern

But there is a difference between knowledge of other peoples and other
times that is the result of understanding, compassion, careful study and
analysis for their own sakes, and knowledge that is part of an overall
campaign of self-affirmation[. [There is, after all, a profound
difference between the will to understand for purposes of co-existence
and enlargement of horizons, and the will to dominate for the purposes
of control. It is surely one of the intellectual catastrophes of history
that an imperialist war confected by a small group of unelected US
officials was waged against a devastated Third World dictatorship on
thoroughly ideological grounds having to do with world dominance,
security control, and scarce resources, but disguised for its true
intent, hastened, and reasoned for by Orientalists who betrayed their
calling as scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ The major influences on
George W Bush\'s Pentagon and National Security Council were men such as
Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami, experts on the Arab and Islamic
world who helped the American hawks to think about such preposterous
phenomena as the Arab mind and centuries-old Islamic decline which only
American power could reverse. [[Today bookstores in the US are filled
with shabby screeds bearing screaming headlines about Islam and terror,
Islam exposed, the Arab threatened the Muslim
menace]{.mark},]{.underline} all of them written by political
polemicists pretending to knowledge imparted to them and others
by experts who have supposedly penetrated to the heart of these strange
Oriental peoples. [[Accompanying such war-mongering expertise have been
CNN and Fox,]{.mark} plus myriad evangelical and right-wing radio hosts,
innumerable tabloids and even middle-brow journals[, all]{.mark} of them
[re-cycling the same unverifiable fictions and vast generalizations so
as to stir up \"America\" against the foreign devil. Without a
well-organized sense that these people over there were not like \"us\"
and didn\'t appreciate \"our\" values \-- the very core of traditional
Orientalist dogma \-- there would have been no
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} So from the very same directorate of
paid professional scholars enlisted by the Dutch conquerors of Malaysia
and Indonesia, the British armies of India, Mesopotamia, Egypt, West
Africa, the French armies of Indochina and North Africa, came the
[[American advisers]{.mark} to the Pentagon and the White House[, using
the same clichés, the same demeaning stereotypes, the same
justifications for power and violence (after all, runs the chorus, power
is the only language they understand]{.mark})]{.underline} in this case
as in the earlier ones. These people have now been joined in Iraq by a
whole army of private contractors and eager entrepreneurs to whom shall
be confided every thing, from the writing of textbooks and the
constitution to the refashioning of Iraqi political life and its oil
industry. [[Every single empire, in its official discourse, has said
that it is not like all the others, that its circumstances are special,
that it has a mission to enlighten, civilize, bring order and democracy,
and that it uses force only as a last resort. And, sadder still, there
always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming words about
benign or altruistic empires.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The alternative is to become exiled intellectuals that don't focus on achieving prizes or recognition but instead analyzes experiences and ideas here and left behind in a contingent manner that is no longer awed by the institution but leads the exiled to a liberated state of discovery that allows one to transcend the life they once lived

[so while it is true to say that exile is the condition that
characterize the intellectual as someone who stands as a marginal figure
outside the comforts of privilege, power, being-at-homeness
(]{.underline}so to speak[), it is also very im- portant to stress that
that condition carries with it certain rewards and even
privileges.]{.underline} So [while you are neither winning prizes nor
being welcomed into all those self-congratulating honor societies that
routinely exclude embarrassing troublemakers who do not toe the party
line, you are at the same time deriving some positive things from exile
and marginality. One of course is the pleasure of being
surprised]{.underline}, of never tak- ing anything for granted, [of
learning to make do in circumstances of shaky instability that would
confound or terrify most other peo- ple.]{.underline} [An intellectual
is fundamentally concerned with knowledge and freedom.]{.underline} Yet
these acquire meaning not as abstractions---as in the rather banal
statement "You must get a good education so that you can enjoy a good
life"---but as experiences actually lived through. [An intellectual is
like a shipwrecked person who learns to live in a certain sense with the
land]{.underline}, not on it, not like Robin- son Crusoe, whose goal is
to colonize his little island, but more like Marco Polo, whose sense of
the marvelous never fails him, and who is always a traveler, a
provisional guest, not a freeloader, conqueror, or raider. Because [the
exile sees things in terms both of what has been left behind and what is
actual here and now,]{.underline} he or she has a dou- ble perspective,
[never seeing things in isolation.]{.underline} Every scene or situation
in the new country necessarily draws on its counterpart in the old
country. [Intellectually this means that an idea or ex- perience is
always counterposed with another]{.underline}, sometimes making them
both appear in a new and unpredictable light: [from that juxtaposition
one gets a better,]{.underline} [perhaps even more universal idea of how
to think]{.underline}, say, [about a human-rights issue in one situation
as compared to another]{.underline}. I have felt that most of the
alarmist and deeply flawed discussions of Islamic fundamentalism in the
West have been intellectually invidious precisely because it has not
been compared with Jewish or Christian fundamentalism, both equally
prevalent and reprehensible in my own experience of the Mid- dle East.
Double or [exile perspective impels a Western intellectual to see what
is usually thought of as a simple issue of judgment against an approved
enemy as part of a much wider picture]{.underline}, with the requirement
now of taking a position as a secularist (or not) 'on all theocratic
tendencies, [not just against the conventionally designated ones. A
second advantage to the exile standpoint for an intellectual is that you
tend to see things not simply as they are but as they have come to be
that way. You look at situations as contingent]{.underline}, not as
inevitable; [look at them as the result of a series of historical
choices made by men and women]{.underline}, [as facts of society made by
human be- ings,]{.underline} and not as natural or God-given, [therefore
unchangeable, permanent, irreversible.]{.underline} 'The great prototype
for this sort of intellectual position is pro- vided by the
eighteenth-century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico, who has long
been a hero of mine. Vico\'s great discovery, which derived in part from
his loneliness as an obscure Neapoli- tan professor---scarcely able to
survive, at odds with the Church and his immediate surroundings---is
that the proper way to under- stand social reality is to understand it
as a process generated from its point of origin, which one can always
locate in extremely hum- ble circumstances. This, he said in his great
work The New Science, 'means seeing things as having evolved from
definite beginnings, as the adult human being derives from the babbling
child. Vico argues that this is the only point of view to take about the
secular world, which he repeats over and over again is historical, with
its own laws and processes, not divinely ordained[. This en- tails
respect, but not reverence, for human society. You look at the grandest
of powers in terms of where it came from and where it might be headed;
you are not awed by the august personality or the 'magnificent
institution, which often compels silence and stunned
subservience]{.underline} from a native, someone who has always seen
(and therefore venerated) the grandeur but not the perforce humbler
human origins from which it derived. [The intellectual in exile is ily
ironic, skeptical, even playful---not cynical]{.underline}. ; aS [any
real exile will confirm, once you leave your home, you cannot simply
take up life wherever you end up and become just another citizen of the
new place]{.underline}. Or [if you do, there is a good deal of
awkwardness involved in the effort]{.underline}, which scarcely seems
worth it. [You can spend a lot of time regretting what you
lost]{.underline}, envying those around you who have always been at
home, near their loved ones, living in the place where they were born
without ever having to experience not only the loss of what was once
theirs [but above all the torturing memory of a life to which they can
never return.]{.underline} On the other hand, as Rilke once said, you
can become a beginner in your circumstances, and [this allows you an
unconventional style of life and, above all, a different, often very
eccentric career.]{.underline} For [the intellectual an exilic
displacement means being liber- ated from the usual career,]{.underline}
in which "[doing well"]{.underline} and following in time-honored
footsteps [are the main milestones. Exile means that you are always
going to be marginal, and that what you do as an intellectual has to be
invented because you cannot follow a prescribed path.]{.underline} If
you can experience that fate, not as a depriva- tion and as something to
be bewailed, but as a sort of freedom, [a process of discovery and doing
things according to your own pattern,]{.underline} as various interests
seize your attention and as the par- ticular goal you set for yourself
dictates, [that is a unique pleasure.]{.underline}

. \"[There has always been an association be- tween the idea of exile
and the terrors of being]{.underline} a leper, [a social and moral
untouchable.]{.underline} During the twentieth century, [exile has been
transformed from the exquisite, and sometimes exclusive, punish- ment of
special individuals]{.underline}---such as Ovid, who was banished from
Rome to a remote town on the Black Sea---[into a cruel punish- ment of
whole communities and peoples]{.underline}, often as the inadvertent
result of impersonal forces such as war, famine, and disease. In this
category are the Armenians, who lived in large numbers throughout the
Eastern Mediterranean (Anatolia especially), but who, after genocidal
attacks by the Turks, flooded nearby Beirut, Aleppo, Jerusalem, and
Cairo, only to be dislocated again during the revolutionary upheavals
after World War Two. I have long been deeply drawn to those large
expatriate or exile commu- nities who peopled the landscape of my youth
in Palestine and Egypt. There were many Armenians, of course, but also
Jews, Ital- ians, and Greeks who, once settled in the Levant, had grown
productive roots there---these communities after all produced prominent
writers like Edmond Jabés, Giuseppe Ungaretti, ° stantine Cavafy---that
were to be brutally torn up afte Nick establishment of Israel in 1948
and after the Suez war of 1yov. Foreigners who symbolized the new
aggressivity of European post- war imperialism to new nationalist
governments (in Egypt and Iraq and elsewhere in the Arab world) were
forced to leave, which, in the case of many old communities, was a
particularly nasty fate. [Some of these people were acclimatized to new
places of residence, but many were, in a manner of speaking, reexiled.
There is a popular but wholly mistaken assumption that to be exiled is
to be totally cut off, isolated, hopelessly separated from your place of
origin. If only that surgically clean separation were possible, because
then at least you could have the consolation of knowing that what you
have left behind is, in a sense, unthink- able and completely
irrecoverable. The fact is that for most exiles the difficulty consists
not simply in being forced to live away from home, but
rather,]{.underline} given today's world, [in living with the many
reminders that you are in exile, that your home is not in fact so far
away, and that the normal traffic of everyday contemporary life keeps
you in constant but tantalizing and unfulfilled touch with the old
place. The exile therefore exists in the median state, neither
completely at one with the new setting nor fully disencumbered of the
old, beset with half involvements and half detachments, nos- talgic and
sentimental on one level, an adept mimic or a secret outcast on
another.]{.underline} Being skilled at survival becomes the main im-
perative, with the danger of becoming too comfortable and secure
constituting a threat that is constantly to be guarded against.

my con-cern here is more with the largely unaccommodated e: , like
Palestinians or the new Muslim immigrants in continental Europe, whose
presence complicates the presumed homogeneity of the new societies in
which they live. [The intellectual who considers him- or herself to be a
part of a more general condition affect- ing the displaced national
community is therefore likely to be a source not of acculturation and
adjustment but rather of volatility and instability. This is by no means
to say that exile doesn't also produce mar- vels of
adjustment]{.underline}. [The United States today is in the unusual
position of having two extremely high former officers in re- cent
presidential administrations]{.underline}---[Henry Kissinger and
Zbigniew Brzezinski---who were]{.underline} (or still are, depending on
the observer\'s outlook) [intellectuals in exile]{.underline}, Kissinger
from Nazi Germany, Brzezinski from communist Poland. In addition,
Kissinger is Jew- ish, which puts him in the extraordinarily odd
position of also qualifying for potential immigration to Israel,
according to its Ba- sic Law of Return. [Yet both Kissinger and
Brzezinski seem, on the surface at least, to have contributed their
talents entirely to their adopted country, with results in eminence,
material rewards, and national]{.underline} (not to say worldwide)
[influence that are light-years away from the marginal obscurity in
which Third World exile intellec- tuals live in Europe or in the
U.S.]{.underline} Having served in government for several decades, [the
two prominent intellectuals are now con- sultants to corporations and
other governments. Brzezinski and Kissinger are not perhaps as socially
excep- tional as one would assume,]{.underline} if it is recalled that
the European theater of World War Two was considered by other
exiles---such as Thomas Mann---as a battle for Western destiny, the
Western soul. [In this "good war" the U.S. played the role of savior,
also providing refuge for a whole generation of scholars, artists, and
scientists who had fled Western fascism for the metropolis of the new
Western imperium.]{.underline} In scholarly fields like the humanities
and social sciences a large group of emigré scholars, some of them such
as Leo Spitzer and Erich Auerbach extremely distinguished, enriched
American universities with their talents and old-world experience.
Others, among them scientists like Edward Teller and Werner von Braun,
entered the Cold War lists as new Americans dedicated to winning the
arms and space race against the Soviet Union. After the war, this
concern was all-engrossing: [it has recently been revealed how
well-placed American intellectuals in the social sciences managed to
recruit former Nazis known for their anticommunist credentials to work
in the U.S. as part of the great crusade.]{.underline}

#### The postion of exile is metaphorical as it is those individuals at odds with society which in the metaphysical sense is the restless and constantly unsettled existence as an outsider

an intellectual may work out an accommodation with a new or emergingly
dominant power in several ways, including the rather shady art of
political trimming, a technique of not taking a clear position but
surviving handsomely nonetheless. But what I want to focus on here is
the opposite: [the intellectual who because of exile cannot or, more to
the point, will not make the adjustment, preferring instead to remain
outside the mainstream, unaccom- modated, uncoopted, resistant. There
are some preliminary points that need to be made.]{.underline} One is
that while it is an actual condition[, exile is also for my purposes a
metaphorical one.]{.underline} By that I mean that [my diagnosis of the
intellectual in exile derives from the social and political history of
dislocation and migration]{.underline} I discussed earlier, [but is not
limited to it]{.underline}. Even [intellectuals who are lifelong members
of a so- ciety can, in a manner of speaking, be divided into insiders
and outsiders:]{.underline} those on the one hand who belong fully to
the society as it is, who flourish in it without an overwhelming sense
of disso- nance or dissent, those who can be called yea-sayers: and, on
the other hand, the nay-sayers, [the individuals at odds with their
soci- ety and therefore outsiders and exiles so far as privileges,
power, and honors are concerned.]{.underline} [The pattern that sets the
course for the intellectual as outsider, which I believe is the right
role for today's intellectual, is best exemplified by the condition of
exile, the state of never being fully adjusted, always feeling outside
the chatty,]{.underline} familiar world inhabited by natives (so to
speak), [tending to avoid and even dislike the trappings of
accommodation and national well-being. Exile for the intellectual in
this metaphysical sense is restlessness, movement, constantly being
unsettled, and unsettling others]{.underline}. [You can't go back to
some earlier and perhaps more stable condition of being at home; and,
alas, you can never fully arrive, be at one with your new home or
situation]{.underline}. Second---and I find myself somewhat surprised by
this obser- vation even as I make it---[the intellectual as exile tends
to be happy with the idea of unhappiness, so that dissatisfaction
bordering on dyspepsia, a kind of curmudgeonly disagreeableness, can be-
come not only a style of thought, but also a new]{.underline}, if
temporary, [habitation]{.underline}. The intellectual as ranting
Thersites perhaps. A great \| historical prototype for what I have in
mind is a powerful eighteenth-century figure, Jonathan Swift, who never
got over his fall from influence and prestige in England after the
Tories left office in 1714, and spent the rest of his life as an exile
in Ireland. Swift was an almost legendary figure of bitterness and
anger--- saeve indignatio, he said of himself in his own
epitaph---furious at Ireland, yet defending it against British tyranny,
a man whose tow- ering Irish works Gulliver\'s Travels and The Drapier's
Letters show a mind flourishing, not to say benefiting, from such
productive anguish.

#### The intellectual is in permanent exile in a state of in betweenness whose consciousness is constantly developing against the discourse of success

**Said 93**

happen before our eyes, as if to say not only that the intellectual is a
being set apart from parents and children, but of life, his procedures
of engaging with it, are necessarily allusive and can be represented
realistically only as a series of discontinu- ous performances. Adorno's
Minima Moralia seems to follow the same logic, although after Auschwitz,
Hiroshima, the onset of the Cold War, and the triumph of America,
representing the intel- lectual honestly is a much more tortuous thing
than doing what Turgenev had done for Bazarov a hundred years earlier.
[The core of Adorno's representation of the intellectual as a permanent
exile, dodging both the old and the new with equal
dexterity,]{.underline} is a writing style that is mannered and worked
over in the extreme. [It is fragmentary, jerky, discontinuous; there is
no plot or predetermined order to follow.]{.underline} [It represents
the intellectual's consciousness as unable to be at rest anywhere,
constantly on guard against the blandishments of success]{.underline},
which, for the perversely in- clined Adorno, means [trying not to be
understood easily and immediately. Nor is it possible to retreat into
complete privacy since,]{.underline} as Adorno says much later in his
career, [the hope of the intellec- tual is not that he will have an
effect on the world but that some- day, somewhere, someone will read
what he wrote exactly as he wrote it,]{.underline} One fragment, number
18 in Minima Moralia, captures the sig- quite perfectly. "Dwelling, in
the proper sense," says Adorno, "is now impossible. The traditional
residences we have grown up in have grown intolerable: each trait of
comfort in them is paid for with a betrayal of knowledge, each vestige
of shelter with the musty pact of family interests." So much for the
prewar life of people who grew up before Nazism. Socialism and American
consumerism are no better: "people live if not in slums, in bungalows
that by tomorrow may be leaf-huts, trailers, cars, camps, or the open
air." Thus, Adorno states, "the house is past lie. over\]. . . . The
best mode of conduct, in face of all this, still seems an uncommitted,
suspended one. . . . [It is part of morality not to be at home in one's
home."]{.underline} Yet no sooner has he reached an apparent conclusion
than Adorno reverses it: ["But the thesis of this paradox leads to de-
struction, a loveless disregard for things which necessarily turns
against people too; and the antithesis, no sooner uttered, is an
ideology for those wishing with a bad conscience to keep what they have.
Wrong life cannot be lived rightly."]{.underline} In other words, [there
is no real escape, even for the exile who tries to remain suspended,
since that state of inbetweenness can itself become a rigid ideological
position, a sort of dwelling whose falseness is covered over in time and
to which one can all too eas- ily become accustomed.]{.underline} Yet
Adorno presses on. "Suspicious prob- ing is always salutary," especially
where the intellectual's writing is concerned. "For a man who no longer
has a homeland, writing becomes a place to live." Yet even so---and this
is Adorno's final touch---there can be no slackening of rigor in
self-analysis:

#### WE must break from the logic of the contemporary intellectual in our attempt to keep moving and represent change without becoming stagnate and static, this does not mean duplicating past destinies of exiles but using a logic that moves away from maintaining things by authorities but rather is motivated through risk and innovation

**Said 93**

Most of us may not be able to duplicate the destiny of exiles like or
C.LR. James, but [their significance for the contempo- rary intellectual
is nevertheless very pertinent.]{.underline} [Exile is a model for the
intellectual who is tempted, and even beset and
overwhelmed]{.underline}, by the rewards of accommodation, yea-saying,
settling in. Even if one is not an actual immigrant or expatriate[, it
is still possible to think as one, to imagine and investigate in spite
of barriers, and always to move away from the centralizing authorities
toward the margins, where you see things that are usually lost on minds
that have never traveled beyond the conventional and the
comfortable]{.underline}. Furthermore, [a condition of
marginality]{.underline}, which may seem irresponsible and unserious, at
least [frees you from having always to proceed with caution, afraid to
overturn the applecart, anxious about upsetting fellow members of the
same corporation]{.underline}. [No one is ever free of attachments and
sentiments]{.underline}, of course. Nor do I have in mind here the
so-alled free-floating intellectual, whose tech- nical competence is on
loan and for sale to anyone. I am saying, however, [that to be as
marginal and as undomesticated as someone 'who is in real exile is for
an intellectual to be unusually responsive not to the potentate but to
the traveler, not the captive of habit and what is comfortably given but
attracted to the provisional and sporty,]{.underline} [committed not to
maintaining things by an authority we have always known but to
innovating by force of risk, experiment, innovation. Not the logic of
the conventional but the audacity of daring, and moving, moving, moving,
representing change, not standing still.]{.underline}

## [General criticism]{.underline}

#### Criticism of Orientalism is the only way to have meaningful debates and achieve education about politics

**Said 3 **

**(**Edward Said, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at
Columbia University, "Preface to Orientalism" page 19-20 Al-Ahram
Weekly, August 25 2003  KS)

All this was obviously undermined and destroyed in Germany by National
Socialism. After the war, Auerbach notes mournfully, the standardization
of ideas, and greater and greater specialization of knowledge gradually
narrowed the opportunities for the kind of investigative and
everlastingly enquiring kind of philological work that he had
represented, and, alas, it\'s an even more depressing fact that since
Auerbach\'s death in 1957 [[both the idea and practice of humanistic
research have shrunk in scope as well as in centrality. Instead of
reading in the real sense of the word, our students today are often
distracted by the fragmented knowledge available on the Internet and in
the mass media]{.mark}. Worse yet, [education is threatened by
nationalist and religious orthodoxies, often disseminated by the mass
media]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}as they focus ahistorically and
sensationally on the distant electronic wars that give viewers the sense
of surgical precision, but in fact obscure the terrible suffering and
destruction produced by modern warfare. [[In the demonization of an
unknown enemy for whom the label \"terrorist\" serves the general
purpose of keeping people stirred up and angry, media images command too
much attention and can be exploited at times of crisis and
insecurity]{.mark} of the kind that the post-9/11 period has
produced.]{.underline}

### FEM-ORIENTALISM

#### Western civilization depends upon the disposability of brown women by depending on their bodies for coherence through their Orientalist mindset; the brown is bad therefore the white is good. This theory of power functions as a superiority complex which allows us to determine who to deem as Godly and who to deem as the shoytan. The resolution and all policies that follow is built off the dead, dying, and poor bodies of the brown female flesh to best create the mechanism that is far from the bad brown but close to the good white. Roksana Badruddoja -Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey-International Review of Modem Sociology, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Spring) 2006 "WHITE SPACES AND BROWN TRAVELING BODIES: A PROJECT OF RE-WORKING OTHERNESS" 

**[Orientalism]{.underline}**, then, is not the difference in cultural
practices, but rather, it is a construct imputed with notions of power
and difference or hierarchy which **[is used as a lens to interpret
cultures]{.underline}**. Dallmayr (1996) boldly states, Orientalism
intensifies\... cultural divisions and fissures, especially the fissure
between hegemonic culture (of Western origin) and the array of not-yet
assimilated and perhaps unassimilable \[sic\] indigenous cultures (135).
And, within this binary, mutually-exclusive Oriental framework,
\"**[western culture tends to enjoy a cushion of complacency provided by
its hegemonic position\"]{.underline}** (135). Herein lays the root
of **[today\'s Orientalist discourse]{.underline}**: its gaze is less
than evenly distributed across populations, it **[legitimizes America\'s
presence in the Orient as the democratic West who will help them become
good citizens]{.underline}**, and it flattens all heterogeneity in a
single all-encompassing category - Middle East to South Asia
(Bonikowski, 2005: 17). Category work which includes a regulatory gaze
and a homogenization process helps to shape collective and individual
narratives of not only migrants and their children in America, but it
also shapes the narratives of hegemonic Americans. **The process of
creating an imagined Orient in turn constructs the very identity of the
Occident**. Said (1979) writes, **[\[Orientalism is]{.underline}**\] not
only a positive doctrine about the Orient that exists at any one time in
the West; it **[is]{.underline}** also **[an influential academic
tradition]{.underline}**, as well as an area of concern defined by
travelers, commercial enterprises, governments, military expeditions,
readers of novels and accounts of exotic adventure, natural historians,
and pilgrims **[to whom the Orient is a specific kind of knowledge about
specific places, people, and civilizations]{.underline}** (203). That
is, **[American Orientalism assumes a central prominence in defining
what it means to be an American]{.underline}**. I now turn to the U.S.
immigration laws of 1965 as yet another instance of Orientalist
practice.

#### The Western world portrays Eastern women as "Exotic Oriental Women" who function as "machine-like creatures" in order to fulfill the European man's sexual desires- This representation of Eastern Women only works to dehumanize them and mark them as "Inferior" to the Eurocentric view of a "desirable women"

**Shabanirad 15**

(Ensieh Shabanirad, PhD Candidate in English Language and Literature,
University of Tehran, Iran Associate Professor, 2015 "Edward Said's
Orientalism and the Representation of Oriental Women in George Orwell's
Burmese Days")

European travel writers created a series of self-confirming
stereotypical images of the East -- as alien, timeless, jealous,
irrational, cruel, lethargic and lascivious -- designed to codify,
comprehend and ultimately rule over the Orient. In Kabbani's view, [the
[depiction of Eastern women]{.mark} in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries [objectified them as exotic creatures who epitomized and
promised the assumed excessive sexual delights of the Orient]{.mark}.
[Women,]{.mark} that is to say, [were]{.mark} part of the goods of
empire, [the living rewards available to men]{.mark}.]{.underline} They
were there to be used sexually, and if it could be suggested that they
were inherently licentious, then [[they could be exploited without
misgiving]{.mark}. [Orientalism makes assumptions]{.mark} [about]{.mark}
gender. Similarly, popular gendered stereotypes circulated such as [the
sexually promiscuous exotic Oriental female]{.mark}. [The exoticised
Oriental female, often depicted nude or
partially-clothed]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in hundreds of Western
works of art during the colonial period, was presented as an immodest,
[[active creature of sexual pleasure who held the key to a myriad of
mysterious erotic delights.]{.mark}]{.underline} In Colonial Fantasies:
Towards a Feminist Reading of Orientalism, Meyda Yegenoglu points out
that, "... when Said discusses the ways in which the Oriental woman is
represented in Flaubert\'s works, he alludes to the uniform association
established between the Orient and sex". (Yegenoglu, 1998: 25) In the
following few lines Said argues that, Woven through all of Flaubert\'s
Oriental experiences, exciting or disappointing, is an almost uniform
association between the Orient and sex. In making this association
Flaubert was neither the first nor the most exaggerated instance of a
remarkably persistent motif in Western attitudes to the Orient . . . Why
[[the Orient seems still to suggest not only fecundity but sexual
promise (and threat), untiring sensuality, unlimited desire, deep
generative energies]{.underline},]{.mark} is something on which one
could speculate\... Nevertheless one must acknowledge its importance as
something eliciting complex responses, sometimes even a frightening
self-discovery, in the Orientalists, and Flaubert was an interesting
case in point. As Said notes, when Flaubert slept with an Egyptian
courtesan, Kuchuk Hanem, he wrote to Louise Colet that "[[the oriental
woman is no more than a machine; she makes no distinction between one
man and another man".]{.mark}]{.underline} (Said, 1978: 187) In so doing
(and in his subsequent novels) he "produced a widely influential model
of the Oriental woman".(Ibid. p: 6) [[But within this influential
narrrative, "she never spoke of herself, never represented her emotions,
presence or history.]{.mark} [He spoke for and represented her.]{.mark}
[He was foreign, comparatively wealthy, male, and these were historical
facts of domination that allowed him not only to possess Kuchuk Hanem
physically but to speak for her and tell his readers in what way she was
typically Oriental]{.mark}]{.underline} \". (ibid) We can imagine how
different her own account might indeed have been. [[Flaubert\'s
situation]{.mark} of strength in relation to Kuchuk Hanem [stands for
the pattern of relative strength between East and West, and the
discourse about the Orient that it enabled.]{.mark}]{.underline} Said's
work has been immensely important and has given rise to a wealth of
studies of how colonial discourse constructs the Other. (Young, 2001:
379) Young's remarks refer directly to native women. In contrast to the
popularity of George Orwell and his books, especially in the third world
countries, as a rebel for a just cause and a freedom fighter, there
exists a duality in the way he treats his subject matter in Burmese
Days. It does much to demonstrate Orwell's attitude towards the Burmese
women and their negative representation. One of the first descriptions
in this novel is that of Burmese children; there are plenty of naked
native children who crawl about performing any bodily function openly.
As there are no British children present in the novel, the sheer number
of native children produces a negative reaction towards the Burmese
women. It seems as if they breed like rabbits. They are perceived
reductively as reproductive subjects. [[Native women are]{.mark} also
[represented as sexual objects and mistresses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like
most of the single British men, Flory had taken a young Burmese woman,
Ma Hla May, as a mistress. He had "bought her from her parents...for
three hundred rupees." (Orwell,31) He had no feelings towards her but
simply used her for sex and otherwise treated her with distaste.
[[Burmese women are merely objects of sexual pleasure]{.mark} for Flory.
[Native women]{.mark} in Burmese Days are fully described and [are
usually compared with animals]{.mark}]{.underline} while the beauty of
English women attracts Orwell's attention to the extent that he focuses
on their faces to suggest their beauty. He also follows the conservative
middle class propriety by not describing the body of the British women,
while he does not follow their code of conduct for the Burmese women. In
this vein, Ma Hla May is most of the time represented as a kitten and a
mare. The point about Ma Hla May is that her status as a Burmese
peasant's daughter makes her childishly easy to objectify. The sense
that Flory has stripped her of her autonomy comes across especially
strongly in some early descriptive passages, which rely heavily on the
iconography of prostitution. Unlike the compassionate, defiant and
sweetly practical women whom Orwell's protagonists fall in love with in
his other novels, Ma Hla May is a mass of hard lines and angular
gestures. Her body is as International Letters of Social and Humanistic
Sciences Vol. 60 27 'contourless as a bas-relief carved upon a
tree'(30), her hair is 'coiled like a tight black cylinder'(ibid.), her
skin is the 'colour of new copper'(ibid.). Her only interests in life
seem to be acquiring trinkets and flaunting herself in front of her
fellow villagers. [The [third person narrator of Burmese Days elaborates
on the hatefulness of the Burmese women by bringing the views of
Elizabeth,]{.mark} [a white Englishwoman,]{.mark}]{.underline} "These
Burmese women repelled Elizabeth more than men; [she [felt her kinship
with them, and the hatefulness of being kin to creatures with Black
faces".]{.mark}]{.underline} (71) John Flory is not above exploiting
Burmese women and his special status as a European man, when such
exploitation suit him. [[The way Flory treats Ma Hla May and ruins her
indicates that a Burmese woman is of little worth for
him]{.underline}.]{.mark} By appearing Elizabeth, he has to end his
clandestine sexual relationship with Ma Hla May and this little worth
for Ma Hla May vanishes for good. According to Sardar: "Power is an
essential ingredient of Orientalism. For amongst the fascinations of the
relationship with the iconic Oriental woman is the use of power to be
cruel and inflict punishment"[.]{.mark} (Sardar, 1999:10) Flory enjoys
referring to and thinking of Ma Hla May as a slave, a slave being one to
whom one can be cruel, that one can punish with impunity and whose
function by definition is to be humiliated. [This is how [imperial
powers saw their subject people,]{.mark} [a slave being one to whom one
can be cruel, that one can punish with impunity and whose function by
definition is to be humiliated.]{.mark} This is [how imperial powers saw
their subject people]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Eastern Women are forced to deal with 'a double colonization' where they are doubly oppressed by colonialism and a patriarchal society- this dooms them to an abyss of perpetual inferiority. **Shabanirad 15,**

(Ensieh Shabanirad, PhD Candidate in English Language and Literature,
University of Tehran, Iran Associate Professor, 2015 "Edward Said's
Orientalism and the Representation of Oriental Women in George Orwell's
Burmese Days")

[By both colonizing and indigenous cultures, it will be clear that under
colonialism [native women are doubly oppressed and exploited by
colonization]{.mark}. McLeod in Beginning Postcolonialism explains that
the term 'a double colonisation' refers to the ways in [which women have
simultaneously experienced the oppression of colonialism and
patriarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Women are subject to representation in
colonial discourses in ways which collude with patriarchal values. Thus
the phrase 'a double colonisation' refers to the fact that women are
twice colonized ─ by colonialist realities and representations, and by
patriarchal ones too. ( McLeod, 2000:175). In Imperial Fictions, Rana
Kabbani looks at the production of the Eastern female as a figure of
licentiousness, and Western heterosexual male desires, in travel writing
and paintings of the 'Oriental' woman and the harem. Kabbani shows how
[[representations of women]{.mark}, constructed by writers like Burton,
[reflected a standard Victorian prejudice, namely that all women were
inferior to men; and that oriental women were doubly inferior, being
both women and orientals.]{.mark} She shows how in reading these
representations we must be aware of the mutually supportive processes of
colonialism and patriarchy which produce Eastern women in eroticized
terms]{.underline}. Colonialism operated very differently for women and
men, and the 'double colonization' that resulted when women were subject
both to general discrimination as colonial subjects and specific
discrimination as women needs to be taken into account in any analysis
of colonial oppression. Leela Gandhi points out that some postcolonial
theorists regard " the third-world woman as victim par excellence ─ the
forgotten casualty of both imperial ideology, and native and foreign
patriarchies". (Gandhi, 1998: 83) Thus the double oppression suffered by
native women should be underscored. For they are in Lois Tyson's words
"the victims of both colonialist ideology, which devalues them because
of their race and cultural ancestry, and patriarchal ideology, which
devalues them because of their sex. Sadly, these women have suffered
patriarchal oppression not only at the hands of colonialists, but within
their own patriarchal cultures as well". ( Lois Tyson, 2006: 421) Within
the colonized societies, where male domination also occurs, the women
are further viewed as a subgroup by their own men, which in turn
justifies their continued subservient status. Burmese Days, as a
colonial novel, includes some highly relevant passages about the
exploitation of native women by both European and native males in the
colony and puts the females into a subaltern situation. In other words,
the novel tells us the story of the subordination of Eastern women and
the domination and exploitation of European and non-European males over
the native women. [[Postcolonial studies increasingly emphasize gender
roles, especially when dealing with the impact of the colonial process
on the women. That women in the colonized society suffer from
exploitation by both colonized and indigenous power structure is well
understood. For example, in his definitive study of colonialism
Postcolonialism Robert Young points out the double exploitation of women
by the patriarchal structures of both colonial power and colonized
indigenous societies: For women, the problem centered on the fact that
the conditions against which they]{.mark} [were campaigning were the
product of two kinds of oppression which put the antagonists of the
nationalist struggle in the same camp: patriarchal systems of
exploitation were common to both colonial regimes and indigenous
societies. Women therefore had to fight the double colonization of
patriarchal domination in its local as well as its imperial
forms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The patriarchic world operates through a lens of masculinity that predominates how come to know the Orient women- this form of domination over the woman further intrenches a cycle of dehumanization.

Orientalism and the Representation of Oriental Women in George Orwell's
Burmese Days")

Ma Hla May is double colonized by Flory as a male and as an agent of the
empire[. In Burmese Days, [rape becomes an unquestioned privilege and
by-product of masculine colonial ambivalence,]{.mark} a fact of life as
banal and unremarkable as the corruption in the jails and hospitals. As
Nancy Paxton asserts in Writing Under the Raj, [the masculinist world of
this text remains "devoid of honor, admiration or love, a world in which
rape is evacuated of its symbolic meanings]{.mark}" (Lazaro, 2001: 258).
[All]{.mark} of the [male characters, native or English, enjoy the right
to rape women]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Burmese villain U Po Kyin is
widely known as a rapist of young girls; Tom Lackersteen, Elizabeth's
uncle, hires Burmese prostitutes whenever he is stationed away from his
wife; Maxwell, the Divisional Forest Officer, carries on with a Eurasian
woman named Molly Pereira; and the protagonist John Flory has had
countless affairs with 'aged Jewish whores' (38), with Eurasian women,
and with a 'full hundred' (120) Burmese prostitutes whose faces and
names he cannot recall. The narrator of Burmese Days glosses over the
ramifications of the male characters' unrestricted sexual access,
leaving unconsidered and unchallenged an enormous network of sexual and
cultural power-struggles. Flory's relationships with his mistress Ma Hla
May reveals his physical and moral inertia. Flory feels guilty about
[[Ma Hla May,]{.mark} whom he literally owns after buying her from her
parents. She [is presented as a mercenary, disloyal and exploitative
woman who has no affection for Flory, and uses him to acquire status and
money.]{.mark}]{.underline} After the sordid encounter with her in
chapter 4, Flory walks several miles into the jungle and bathes in a
clear pool, a cleansing ritual which temporarily washes away his guilt.
[When [Ma Hla May and the young Englishwoman meet]{.mark} for the first
time, [she immediately sees her disadvantage as a Burmese woman when
pitted against an Englishwoman for the attentions of an
Englishman]{.mark}. By contrast, [Elizabeth]{.mark} has the luxury of
[not even being certain that Ma Hla May is female]{.mark}; moreover, she
[could never conceive of a Burmese woman as a threat to
herself.]{.mark}]{.underline} Elizabeth is used to being the standard by
which conventions of femaleness are judged. The thought of competing
with a Burmese woman for Flory's attentions or for anything else, for
that matter, would be completely beyond and, to her mind, beneath her.
It is when Flory intercedes in this meeting that we see an example of
his exploitation of his position of superiority for his own aims. In
response to Ma Hla May's inquiry about the identity of the Englishwoman,
Flory "answered casually, as though giving an order to a servant: 'Go
away this instant. If you make any trouble I will afterwards take a
bamboo and beat you till not one of your ribs is whole'" (52). Once Ma
Hla May heeds his coldblooded warning and leaves, [[Flory lies to
Elizabeth by telling her that the woman who has just left 28 Volume 60
is "\[o\]ne of the servants' wives, I believe". (ibid.) In this
incident, Flory exploits his privilege as an Englishman by threatening a
Burmese woman.]{.underline}]{.mark} An interesting detail appears in
Orwell\'s depiction of Ma Hla May. \"She believed that lechery was a
form of witchcraft, giving a woman magical powers over a man, until in
the end she could weaken him to a half-idiotic slave. Each successive
embrace sapped Flory\'s will and made the spell stronger... this was her
belief\" (32). In the scene in which she begs Flory to take her back, to
let her live in his house even if he marries Elizabeth, this motive
again appears: \"Perhaps even now she thought that with her arms around
him and her body against his she could renew her power over him\" (95).
We see the situation only from his point of view, which includes the
usual wretched admission of guilt, after he casts her out[. [Since
Flory\'s viewpoint predominates, the reader is invited to consider Ma
Hla May as, in fact, a money-grubbing prostitute from beginning to
end.]{.underline}]{.mark} There is a scene when Flory asks Elizabeth to
explain why she snubbed him that morning, Elizabeth clings to the
pretext that she has discovered he was keeping a Burmese woman. And now,
though Flory thinks the accusation isn\'t even true (since he had
recently thrown out Ma Hla May), he recognizes his guilt: He had not
even the heart to be angry any longer. For he had perceived, with the
deadly self-knowledge and self-loathing that come to one at such a time,
that what had happened served him perfectly right. For a moment it
seemed to him that an endless procession of Burmese women, a regiment of
ghosts, were marching past him in the moonlight. Heavens, what numbers
of them! A thousand no, but a full hundred at the least\.... Their heads
turned towards him, but they had no faces, only featureless discs\....
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices (pleasant, indeed!) make
instruments to plague us. He had dirtied himself beyond redemption, and
this was his just punishment. (120) But Flory\'s awareness, as this
passage shows, is deeply flawed. [[He, in effect, feels guilty about the
wrong thing: He has \"dirtied himself beyond redemption\" (ibid) the
very words suggest the sahib\'s view of a dangerous social descent and
the possibility of contamination]{.mark} [whenever he engages in sexual
relations with native women.]{.mark}]{.underline} Flory\'s failure to
accept responsibility for his action is evident when Ma Hla May suddenly
appears and corners him, just as he had cornered Elizabeth. She demands
money and threatens to make a scene, and Flory\'s guilt at once changes
into anger and the desire to humiliate her. Flory deliberately throws on
the ground the money and the cigarette case she has extracted from him.
In this scene Ma Hla May is described as a wretched woman following him
\'\'like a disobedient dog\" (121). There is an inevitability about
Flory\'s interactions with her that is in sharp contrast to Orwell\'s
critique of imperialism. The patriarchal and colonial struggles are more
obvious in the relationships between European men and native women.
[[European men who cannot sufficiently manifest their masculine
exploitations on European women can easily carry out this masculine
exploitation of native women.]{.underline}]{.mark} Therefore, while
European women are exploited once, native women are exploited twice.
[[Civilized European men who are honourable, modest, and polite to
European women become cruel, brutish and sadistic to native women.
Native women are often exploited or abused sexually, and in short they
cannot speak.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## [Afro-Orientalism]{.underline}

#### The Law continuously establishes exclusionary policies- rendering nonwhite people doomed to endless oppression; strengthening white supremacy and Western Imperialism- It's key for people of color to act in opposition to orientalism and color lines.

Proposal", Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Religion Volume 1, Issue 7
(June 2010))

In her study of black attitudes toward the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
through analysis of black newspapers in the nineteenth century, Helen H.
Jun shows how Orientalist discourses of Chinese cultural difference
facilitated the "assimilation of black Americans to ideologies of
political modernity and consolidated black identification as U.S.
national subject" while reifying the Orientalist logic of the
anti-Chinese movement.18 For instance, she quotes historian Arnold
Shankman who observed that, "from 1880-1935 almost every time the
Chinese were mentioned in the black press, it was in connection with
intrigue, prostitution, murder, the sale of opium or children for money
. . . superstitious practices, shootings or tong wars."19 As Jun argues,
it was crucial for black Americans to emphasize the "Christian formation
of the black national subject in explicating black qualification for
citizenship, which, consequently, Orientalizes, or discursively
disciplines the Chinese and Indian as inadequate to political
modernity."20 [Although black Orientalist discourse on Chinese
difference was employed to articulate the "Americanness" of black people
in opposition to "Asians," whose religious and cultural differences
rendered them unfit to be considered "Americans," [black Americans
realized that when federal legislation excludes one group of people
based on race it could do the same to them, thus negatively affecting
their own collective endxeavor to claim the full rights of U.S.
citizenship.21 Many black Americans protested the Chinese Exclusion Act
as a result.]{.mark}]{.underline}22 This legacy of
Afro/black-Orientalism illustrates the following points. First,
uncritical adherence to "Americanness" would not help racial/ethnic
minority groups in their claiming of full U.S. citizenship. Second,
Christianity became a double-edged sword---one that challenged white
supremacy and another that reinscribed American Orientalism.
[Last, [black political support of Chinese immigration was not based on
racial identification with the Chinese, whose gendered racial and
immigrant formations were different from those of African Americans, but
based on a common political struggle against white supremacist
nationalism that had excluded racial/ethnic minority groups from
claiming the full rights of citizenship in the United States. The
Bandung Conference, often referred to as the Asian-African
Conference]{.mark}]{.underline}, was held in Bandung, Indonesia, in
1955, with the leaders of twenty-nine independent Asian and African
nations participating.24 [The [strategy]{.mark} of Asian and African
nations in the conference was to "[strengthen their independence from
Western imperialism while keeping the Soviet bloc at a comfortable
distance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}"25 The creation of this
strategic bloc, comprised of significant portions of the so-called third
world, was the beginning of what came to be known as the "nonaligned"
movement. According to Richard Wright, one of two African Americans who
observed the conference from the beginning, [[Bandung was an indictment
of Western racialism, which had been the cornerstone of Western
justification for colonial exploitation and promotion of the idea of
white Western racial superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}.26 Wright also
wrote that the [[Bandung Conference stressed economic cooperation among
the Asian and African powers.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Along with the desire
for economic cooperation among the participating countries, the Bandung
Conference represented postcolonial nationalists' call for the renewal
of the ancient Asian and African cultures and religions that had been
interrupted during the past centuries.27 In other
words, [[Bandung ]{.mark}characterized postcolonial
nationalists' [emphasis on reviving traditional cultures and
religions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although many attempts to restore
often-nostalgic notions of tradition and culture were problematic as
carried out in postcolonial societies during their nation-building
processes, examining them helps us understand the ongoing role of
"religion" in colonial, anti-colonial, and postcolonial power
struggles.28

#### New forms of racism continue to endlessly reproduce domestically and internationally- Afro-Orientalism is key to address this unending cycle

Yet, as black feminist Patricia Hill Collins stresses, the racial
hierarchies Du Bois observed a century ago continue to exist not only on
a local level but also on a global scale.32 [[We now face what Hill
Collins calls "new racism," which is "transnational" due to the global
market economy and global mass media.33Racialized and gendered
globalization continues to produce color lines in the twenty-first
century]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, while admitting that the
"excavations of AfroAsian solidarity might be nostalgic and
anachronistic,"34 Prashad nonetheless maintains that the
"epistemological and historical archive of solidarity" and "memory of
the interactions" must be brought to light.35 In a similar vein, Mullen
states, "AfroAsian solidarity needs a constant reorientation to itself.
The constant threat of historical erasure of the coalition building of
ethnic communities necessitates an urgent, disciplined commitment to a
'useable' AfroAsian past."[36 [By challenging white supremacy, which has
persistently pit one racial/ethnic minority group against
another, Afro/black-Orientalism may shed new light on the forgotten
history of interactions and coalitions among African, African Americans,
and Asians and Asian North Americans in their concerted efforts to
resist racism, colonialism, and U.S.]{.mark}
[imperialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}37 Engaging Afro/black-Orientalism is
not a naïve attempt to romanticize the relationship between people of
African descent and Asian descent when the relationship between these
groups has been strenuous if not totally hostile as shown in incidents
such as the Los Angeles Riot of 1992 and the ongoing plight of biracial
children between African American fathers and "Asian" mothers on U.S.
military bases in Asia. [Rather, [engaging Afro/black-Orientalism needs
to be understood as an effort to underscore the "political solidarity"
that has characterized various forms of Afro-Asian connections and
coalition, including black American protests against the Chinese
Exclusion Act and other discriminatory U.S. immigration
policies]{.mark}. In turn, [this helps disrupt the black and white
racial binary]{.mark} that has characterized racism and racial
formations in mainstream U.S. culture]{.underline}. In what follows, I
will briefly discuss some of the implications of engaging
Afro/black-Orientalism for doing interdisciplinary religious/theological
studies from an Asian Pacific North American feminist perspective by
highlighting shared interests between the [two.in](http://two.in/) the
midst of ongoing U.S. war against Iraq, feminist scholar in religion
Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza calls for a critical analysis of American
capitalist nationalism as a structure of domination.39 The end goal of
such analysis, however, is not just to critique and analyze American
nationalism and national identity. Rather, as Sharon D. Welch has
rightly put it, [[what is equally needed]{.mark} is to articulate
"[alternative forms of national identity and global order and
responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}."40 In her response to Schüssler
Fiorenza's urgent call to engage acritical analysis of American
nationalism as a structure of domination, Welch defines "critique" as a
form of "patriotism and an affirmation of a complex identity as national
and global citizens."41 Such critique is found in the works of Du Bois
and other African American intellectuals, who understood their fate
under U.S. racist domestic policy in relation to others who suffer under
Western imperial exploitation. For instance, when Du Bois talked
abou[t ["the world problem of the color line"]{.mark} in 1914, [he was
linking the fate of African Americans to the race problem in the
world.]{.mark} Likewise, [African
American anti-colonial activists]{.mark} of the 1940s strongly [argued
that their struggles against Jim Crow were inseparably bound to the
struggles of African and Asian peoples for independence from
colonialism.]{.mark}]{.underline}42 As Penny M. Von Eschen puts it,
African Americans' critique of American empire was closely related to
their critique of colonialism elsewhere, and offering a critique of
American empire did not preclude them from being in solidarity with
other colonized people.

#### Afro Orientalism represents itself as a critical trajectory of thought in opposition to the way the western world has inflicted oppression upon Blacks and Asians- it allows an ideological approach towards solidarity that is not based on racial difference; rather racial coalition.

**Kim 10**

(Nami Kim, Ph.D. Chair, Associate Professor at Spellman College,
Philosophy and Religious Studies, "Engaging Afro/black-Orientalism: A
Proposal", Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Religion Volume 1, Issue 7
(June 2010))

Bill V. Mullen defines [[Afro-Orientalism as a counterdiscourse that "at
times shares with its dominant namesake certain features but primarily
constitutes an independent critical trajectory of thought on the
practice and ideological weight of Orientalism in the Western
world."]{.underline}]{.mark}8 Asian American studies scholar Helen H.
Jun notes that although black Orientalism has no singular meaning or
manifestation, it encompasses "an entire range of black imaginings of
Asia that are in fact negotiations with the limits and disappointments
of black citizenship."9 Whether it is limited to the discourse of black
citizenship in relation to U.S. policy on Asian immigrants, or to the
discourses of antiracism and anti-imperialism, Afro/blackOrientalism, as
Mullen puts it, is a "signifying discourse on race, nation, and global
politics constituting a subtradition in indigenous U.S. writing on
imperialism, colonialism, and the making of capitalist empire."10 As
such, [[Afro/black-Orientalism acknowledges not only the problems of
Orientalism, Western imperialism, and capitalism but also the extent to
which such problems have affected African Americans, Asian Americans,
Africans, and Asians, sometimes in paralleled ways and sometimes through
different trajectories.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Hence,
Afro/black-Orientalism, as Jun puts it, is "not employed as an
accusatory and **reductive** condemnation that functions to chastise
black individuals or institutions for being imperialist, racist, or
Orientalist."11 Rather, [[Afro/black-Orientalism is employed as an
important site where a crude opposition between blacks and Asians can be
contested, where the parallel courses of Western imperialism through
Asia and Africa can be explored, where the experiences of African
Americans and Asian Americans as slaves and indentured servants in the
Americas, respectively, can be compared, and where cross-racial,
cross-ethnic, and trans-Pacific political solidarity that is not based
on racial identification can be sought
out.]{.underline}]{.mark} Exploring instances of Afro/black-Orientalism
in various historical contexts illuminates not only the importance of
race but also how crucial it is to explore how gender, sexuality, and
religion intersect with race and class in the face of ongoing racism,
sexism, heterosexism, militarism, and class exploitation. Many (mostly
male) African American political activists and intellectuals in the
United States in the early twentieth century hailed Japan as a role
model that challenged white supremacy, rejoicing in the news that Japan
had defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. W. E. B. Du Bois, known
as the American founder of Pan-Africanism, was among many
AfricanAmericans who saw the beginning of the end for white supremacy in
Japan's defeat of Russia in 1905.12 Ironically, however, Du Bois's
pro-Japanese stance resonated with Japan's colonial rhetoric of "saving
Asia from the Western imperialism." For instance, he stated, "The idea
of Japan was to invoke war and force\--to drive Europe out of Asia and
substitute the domination of a weak Asia by a strong Japan."13 Although
some African American political activists considered Japan's "victory"
in Asia as a positive sign that white supremacy could be overcome,
Japan's imperialism reinscribed another form of racial hierarchy in the
Asian Pacific region. Even when Japan invaded Manchuria, instead of
criticizing Japan, many African Americans criticized the denunciation of
the Japanese invasion in China in the mainstream U.S. press, which they
considered as hypocritical in light of the fact that the mainstream U.S.
press did not condemn the white supremacy that Europe and the United
States had imposed on Shanghai.14 Hence, Japan's invasion of
Nanjing---the Nanjing massacre in particular---did not minimize African
American intellectuals' pro-Japanese stance. According to David Levering
Lewis, Du Bois said in reference to the Nanjing massacre that the
Japanese neither invented nor perfected "killing the unarmed and
innocent in order to reach the guilty," by pointing out terrible
instances of European conduct drawn from South Africa, the Punjab, and
Guernica.15 Du Bois summed up the thoughts of many African Americans
when he posed this question upon arriving in China in the 1930s: "Why is
it that you \[the Chinese\] hate Japan more than Europe when you have
suffered more from England, France, and Germany, than from Japan."16 At
the same time, despite his support of Japanese imperialism (while
criticizing European imperialism), his romanticization of "Asia," and
his idealization of China under communism, Du Bois was one of the most
vigorous critiques of the "Yellow Peril" in racial theories and the
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. He was also a
leading proponent of anticolonialism in Africa and Asia, and an untiring
critic of U.S. white supremacist nationalism and capitalism. For him,
full emancipation meant freeing "the majority of workers who are yellow,
brown, and black."17 After realizing the cruelty and aggression that
Japanese imperialism had wrought in Asia, [[Du Bois asserted that
imperialism by any race was unconscionable. For him and many other
African American intellectuals and activists, anti-colonialist struggle
meant not only vigorous opposition and critique of white supremacy but
also denouncement of imperialism and racial hierarchy in any
form.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Finally, engaging Afro/black-Orientalism can
help us explore the ways in which the parameters of struggle are defined
in religious/theological studies, whether the struggle is against
racism, sexism, heterosexism, or imperialism. In other words, [[engaging
Afro/black-Orientalism can assure that oppression needs to be
conceptualized in ways that one form of oppression is not prioritized
over another based on identity politics, or that racial/ethnic conflict
among minority groups is not looked at simply as a matter between the
two without dealing with white supremacy.]{.underline}]{.mark} This way
of conceptualizing oppression and forming strategic coalitions based on
such conceptualization becomes especially significant given the recent
development of transnational alliances of Christian Right with
antifeminist perspectives and practices that cut across national
borders, extensively affecting and altering people's lives. [[What we
can inherit from Afro-Asian connections, especially from the Bandung
Conference, is that the core struggles that have rendered "third world"
as oppositional consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Although the spirit
of the Bandung has vanished, [rearticulated notion of third-world
oppositional consciousness]{.mark} that is not based on geography nor
based solely on shared experiences of oppression [can be
useful]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Chandra Mohanty has rightly put it,
thirdworld oppositional consciousness and struggle is defined as "the
way we think about race, class, and gender\--the political links we
choose to make among and between struggles."53 [[Such understanding of
oppositional consciousness and struggle can help provide a platform
where new ways of understanding oppression can be articulated]{.mark},
and where anti-racist, anti-sexist, antiheterosexist, and
anti-imperialist transnational feminist alliances can be articulated and
formed.]{.underline}

### PERM

#### PERM CARD:Critiques of orientalist scholarship ignores that there cannot be a true representation of anything and that representation is intertwined with other ideas and concepts, means the permutation is the best analysis of orientalism through other contexts

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"ORIENTALISTS\' COMPLICITY IN IMPERIALISM

One of Said\'s major theses is that Orientalism was not a disinterested,
scholarly activity but a political one, with Orientalists preparing the
ground for and colluding with imperialists: \"[To say simply that
Orientalism was a rationalization of colonial rule is to ignore the
extent to which colonial rule was justified in advance by Orientalism,
rather than after the fact]{.underline}\" (p. 39). [The Orientalist
provides the knowledge that keeps the Oriental under
control:]{.underline} \"Once again, knowledge of subject races or
Orientals is what makes their management easy and profitable; knowledge
gives power, more power requires more knowledge, and so on in an
increasingly profitable dialectic of information and control\" (p. 36).
This is combined with Said\'s thesis, derived from the Coptic socialist
thinker Anwar Abdel Malek, that [the Orient is always seen by the
Orientalists as unchanging, uniform, and peculiar (p. 98), with
Orientals reduced to racist stereotypes and seen as ahistorical
\"objects\" of study \"stamped with an otherness \... of an essentialist
character]{.underline}\" (p. 97, quoting Malek). [The Orientalists have
provided a false picture of Islam:]{.underline} \"Islam has been
fundamentally misrepresented in the West\" (p. 272). Said adds Foucault
to the heady mix; the French guru\["convinced Said that [Orientalist
scholarship took place within the ideological framework he called
\"discourse\" and that \"the real issue is whether indeed there can be a
true representation of anything, or " "whether any and all
representations, because they are representations, are embedded first in
the language and then in the culture, institutions, and political
ambience of the representer. If the latter alternative is the correct
one]{.underline} (as I believe it is[), then we must be prepared to
accept the fact that a representation is eo ipso implicated,
intertwined, embedded, interwoven with a great many other things besides
the \`truth,\' which is itself a representation]{.underline}\" (p. 272).
It takes little thought to see that there is a contradiction in Said\'s
major thesis.\" If Orientalists have produced a false picture of the
Orient, Orientals, Islam, Arabs, and Arabic society-and, in any case,
[for Said there is no such thing as \"the truth\"-then how could this
false or pseudoknowledge have helped European imperialists to dominate
three-quarters of the globe? \"Information and control,\" wrote Said,
but what of \"false information and control\"?"]{.underline} "To argue
his case, Said very conveniently leaves out the important contributions
of German Orientalists, for their inclusion would destroy-and their
exclusion does indeed totally destroy-the central thesis of Orientalism,
that all Orientalists produced knowledge that generated power, and that
they colluded and helped imperialists found empires. As we shall see,
German Orientalists were the greatest of all scholars of the Orient,
but, of course, Germany was never an imperial power in any of the
Oriental countries of North Africa or the Middle East. Lewis wrote,
\"\[A\]t no time before or after the imperial age did \[the British and
French\] contribution, in range, depth, or standard, match the
achievement of the great centers of Oriental studies in Germany and
neighbouring countries. Indeed, any history or theory of Arabic studies
in Europe without the Germans makes as much sense as would a history or
theory of European music or philosophy with the same omission.\"48 Would
it have made sense for German Orientalists to produce work that could
help only England or France in their empire building?" "Those omitted
are not peripheral figures but the actual creators of the field of
Middle Eastern, Islamic, and Arabic studies: scholars of the standing of
Paul Kahle, Georg Kampffineyer, Rudolf Geyer, E Giese, Jacob Barth,
August Fischer, Emil Gratzl, Hubert Grimme, Friedrich Schulthess,
Friedrich Schwally, Anton Baumstark, Gotthelf Bergstrasser; others not
discussed include G. Wustenfeld, Alfred Von Kremer, J. Horovitz, A.
Sprenger, and Karl Vollers. Though Theodor NOldeke, Johann Fuck, G.
Weil, Carl Heinrich Becker, E. Sachau, and Carl Brockelmann are
mentioned, their work and significance are not discussed in any detail;
Noldeke, whose Geschichte des Qordns (1860) was to become the foundation
of all later Koranic studies, is considered one of the pioneers, along
with Goldziher, of Islamic studies in the West."

**[Following the regional financial crisis of 1997 -- 1998, leaders of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) began promoting the
idea of a 'people-centred' community in Southeast Asia and, towards this
end, widening policy-making to include civil society organisations
(CSOs)]{.underline}**. [ASEAN first signalled this shift with its Vision

creating a 'community of caring societies' where 'civil society is

http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2015.1016304 agreements, and with the
decision to design the ASEAN Charter, the term 'people-centred' became
even more 'en vogue' (Morada, 2008). **[Consulting with civil society
thus became a consistent part of ASEAN rhetoric.]{.underline}**
Accompanying this rhetorical shift was the emergence of two new forms of
participation for CSOs in ASEAN. Since 1979 an affiliation system has
operated where CSOs can apply for affiliation, which brings with it some
participatory functions. However, since 2005 CSOs have been consulted by
multiple ASEAN bodies, the most high-profile being the consultations
conducted for the ASEAN Charter. Since 2006 CSOs have also participated
in ASEAN through three annual sectoral forums on Migrant Labour, Social
Welfare and Development, and Rural Development and Poverty Eradication,
organised to facilitate dialogue between officials and CSOs. **[This
widening of policy-making to include CSOs was an abrupt shift from
ASEAN's previous style of regional governance, characterised by
closed-door meetings and tacit agreements among leaders.]{.underline}**
**[This shift was not a stand-alone endeavour, but emerged alongside the
market-building reform programme that ASEAN embarked on after the
regional financial crisis.]{.underline}** **[ASEAN's conspicuous absence
from the recovery process prompted criticisms, advanced by 'a bolder and
bettereducated middle class challenging the paternalistic order of the
past']{.underline}** (Ahmad & Ghosal, 1999, p. 767), amidst a rising
wave of populism and domestic political upheavals---most acutely in
Indonesia with the collapse of the Suharto regime. In response to
criticisms regarding its practices and purpose, [ASEAN rapidly
intensified regional economic integration through the creation of an
integrated and liberal market---the ASEAN Economic Community---to
facilitate states' efforts to compete for global capital
flows.]{.underline} To further these market-building reforms,1 regional
governance was organised around a regulatory framework where state
actors collaborate through regional networks to harmonise domestic
policies (Gerard, 2014b). As noted by Jayasuriya, regulatory regionalism
'should not be viewed as a departure from the disciplines of the global
economy, but as an attempt to instantiate the disciplines of
neoliberalism within a regional framework' (2003, p. 206). [This shift
in regional governance mirrored regulatory transformations in statehood
across members and their embedded 'politics of competitiveness', where
'the orientation of these regimes reflects national trajectories that
have seen the outflanking or defeat of more radical class and
developmental projects by enthusiastic proponents of capitalist
development']{.underline} (Cammack, 2009, p. 269; see introduction to
this special issue by Carroll & Jarvis). ASEAN is but one example of the
broad trend of regional and global governance institutions widening
policy-making to include CSOs. This trend emerged in the 1970s and
increased in intensity from the 1990s. A rich empirical literature
documents this trend and raises various questions such as why governance
institutions have shifted to engage these disparate interests and how,
and the limitations of this process. [This article harnesses political
economy analysis to explain the inclusion of CSOs in regional and global
policy-making, and explores this trend through the lens of the ASEAN
case, drawing on 54 interviews conducted with ASEAN officials and CSO
representatives.]{.underline} The first section outlines the limitations
of mainstream International Relations (IR) approaches in accounting for
this trend before describing the political economy approach used here,
drawn from the framework of Jayasuriya and Rodan (2007) that considers
modes of participation as the unit of analysis. **[The application of
this framework---novel to the study of civil society participation in
regional and global policy-making---acknowledges that different systems
of structuring civil society participation produce varying opportunities
for CSOs to influence policy.]{.underline}** In the second section I
apply this analytical framework to ASEAN's participatory channels.2
Focusing on the questions of who can participate and how, and the
struggles that 366 K. Gerard have accompanied the establishment of these
new modes of participation, I describe and explain the boundaries of
civil society participation with reference to underlying political
economy relationships. This article demonstrates that ASEAN's
participatory mechanisms are structured to include particular interests
amenable to its reform agenda and marginalise non-compatible groups. It
asserts that ASEAN's 'people-centred' agenda is intended to address some
of the social forces that have organised around issues arising from the
rapid and predatory mode of capitalist development prevalent in the
region, demonstrating that participatory policy-making is not implicitly
democratising. A Political Economy Approach to Understanding CSOs'
Participation in Policy-making ASEAN's shift to engage CSOs parallels
the trend seen in many, if not most, regional and global governance
institutions. This practice can be traced back to the founding of the
United Nations; however, it has grown in intensity in recent decades. A
rich empirical literature documents this trend and limitations of space
do not warrant a comprehensive review. However, while describing the
expanding presence of CSOs in regional and global policy-making, these
studies also highlight the substantial differences that exist across
institutions in the participatory mechanisms that have been established,
and the forms of participation they subsequently enable. For example,
the EU's Citizen's Initiative permits CSOs to propose agenda items for
meetings of the European Commission (European Commission, 2010).
However, CSOs seeking to lobby the WTO are limited to attending the
Plenary Meetings of the Ministerial Council that are broadcast over the
internet and participating in ad hoc public symposia where the agenda is
set by the WTO (van den Bossche, 2010). Regional and global governance
institutions regulate civil society access in a range of forms, creating
varying opportunities for CSOs to influence policy-making.
Justifications for why these institutions open their political
structures to include these disparate interests also vary across
institutions. Empirically, claims of the benefits of civil society
engagement are highly contested. [Scholars and practitioners argue that
civil society involvement in regional and global policy-making provides
a partial solution to issues arising from the 'democracy deficit' that
relevant institutions struggle with. Problematically, arguments for the
accountability and legitimacy benefits of civil society participation
assume that CSOs represent the interests of those that would otherwise
be disenfranchised]{.underline} (cf. Verweij & Josling, 2003, p. 13[),
and that CSOs are, and remain, independent of the influence of states,
donors, and private interests. The question of CSOs being consulted in
policy-making is also distinct from whether CSOs shape political
outcomes through such consultations]{.underline}, underscored by Betsill
and Corell's (2008) assessment of the scholarship on civil society
participation in environmental governance which highlights that while
CSOs promote particular policy frameworks, little evidence exists
demonstrating their influence on policy outcomes. Furthermore, **[CSOs
and governance institutions are highly complex and diverse entities,
creating significant logistical issues in establishing some form of
collaborative relationship. Scholte (2011) highlights qualitative
problems encountered during consultations, noting that CSOs may be
consulted only towards the end of the policy cycle once the policy
direction is decided]{.underline}**; meetings may be convened at short
notice, with little preparation or follow-up with participants;
consultations may serve simply as public relations exercises during
high-level meetings or 'tick-the-box' affairs; and finally, officials
may consider consultations as a one-way rather than a two-way dialogue,
disseminating information rather than hearing CSOs' views. Thus,
institutions' inclusion of CSOs in policy-making has not been
unproblematic or uncontested. These various issues raise questions
regarding the overall impact of CSOs' inclusion on political outcomes.
ASEAN's Engagement of Civil Society 367 Recognising the limitations of
this process, scholars have called for caution in advancing civil
society engagement in regional and global policy-making, recommending
various prescriptions to advance this process in a manner that raises
accountability, legitimacy, and representation in policy-making. For
example, Scholte asserts: 'In a word, what is wanted in the period ahead
is more, more inclusive, more competent, more coordinated, and more
accountable civil society engagement at the heart of policy processes on
the full range of global governance processes' (2007, p. 316).While
these accounts highlight the limitations of this process, scholarly
analysis should shift beyond recommending improvements to explaining how
and why this process is constrained. Theoretically, dominant IR
approaches are limited in accounting for why and how regional and global
institutions engage CSOs and the limitations of this process. The
shortcomings of realist approaches in accounting for this trend require
little elaboration: realists conceive of states as unitary actors in
pursuit of their interests, making power the only mediating factor in
international politics. Liberals consider the shift to include CSOs in
policy-making as a means of increasing efficiency, needed to deal with
the ever-growing complexity of regional and global policy-making
(Florini & Simmons, 2000; Slaughter, 2004). However, it is not readily
apparent that CSOs' participation increases the efficiency of
policy-making, given that CSOs are another voice to be added to already
crowded deliberations. Additionally, many institutions direct
significant resources towards supporting CSOs' engagement, such as the
UN's NonGovernmental Liaison Service. Beyond acknowledging CSOs as
sources of information and conduits for publicising policy decisions,
liberals also do not elaborate how CSOs participate. Slaughter posits
that networks of non-state actors can support government networks in
addressing the growing complexities of governance (2004, p. 33).
However, the liberal framing of civil society consultations as directed
towards problem-solving and consensus-building assumes that CSOs
interact with officials in a non-conflictual manner. Liberals assume
that these disparate actors are united by a common purpose that subsumes
the politics that accompany this process, overlooking issues such as the
unequal distribution of power that creates the potential for decisions
to be imposed, rather than bargained (see Peters & Pierre, 2004). While
constructivists place greater emphasis on the role of CSOs in global
politics, these accounts offer only a partial explanation for this
trend. On the question of why these institutions widen policy-making to
include CSOs, constructivists assert this can be explained through the
concept of norm diffusion, as argued by Collins (2013) and Ru¨land
(2014) in the ASEAN case and Saurugger (2010) in the EU case. However,
constructivists acknowledge that this framework provides little in
elaborating why actors that internalise a norm fail to exhibit the
desired behaviour---what is termed 'partial norm socialisation'
(Checkel, 2005; Risse, Ropp, & Sikkink, 1999; Saurugger, 2010). In her
examination of the flawed implementation of the participatory norm in
the EU, Saurugger (2010) observes that norms are rhetorically embraced
when deemed necessary and later violated when doing so is feasible.
However, this observation does not explain this trend according to the
constructivist paradigm. Constructivists have attempted to account for
cases of partial norm by extending the norm diffusion logic to instances
of institutional normative change, termed 'mimetic adoption' (Katsumata,
2011). In the ASEAN case constructivists have argued that officials
sought to emulate regional integration processes in the EU or global
norms as a legitimising tool; however, their embrace of these new ideas
is superficial, directed only towards deflecting unwanted attention,
which has created a gap between rhetoric and practice. These accounts
explain ASEAN's participatory agenda and its limitations through
interpretations of existing norms (Collins, 2013; Ru¨land, 2014),
emphasising the role of extant ideas, known as an 368 K. Gerard actor's
'cognitive prior' (Acharya, 2009), in shaping ASEAN's responses to new
ideas. However, by explaining this process principally through
ideational change, these accounts overlook the role of social conflict
in this process, failing to systematically account for why some issues
have been deemed suitable for civil society consultations in ASEAN (e.g.
rural development and poverty eradication) and others have not (such as
land evictions), nor why some CSOs are excluded and the rules governing
how they can participate. Constructivism does, in fact, account for
instances of partial norm socialisation in constructivists' assertion
that 'ideas matter'---to the extent that the shift to embrace a new idea
will eventually produce the desired behaviour. Wheeler draws from
Skinner in arguing this point: whether the actor is sincere or not is
beside the point since what matters is that, once an agent has accepted
the need to legitimate his behavior, he is committed to showing that his
actions 'were in fact motivated by some accepted set of social and
political principle'. (2000, p. 9; citing Skinner, 1988) Similarly, Keck
and Sikkink's (1998) 'boomerang effect' argues that in cases where
actors embrace a norm for strategic reasons, they will be pressured to
alter their behaviour accordingly and non-compliance will become
increasingly difficult, leading to the norm being 'embedded'.
Constructivists thus assert that an actor will alter their behaviour in
accordance with a norm they embraced only for strategic reasons to
demonstrate the authenticity of their shift to accept that idea.
However, state actors frequently rhetorically embrace new ideas, while
simultaneously seeking to reduce their commitments (Naidoo, 2010, p.
28). In the case of ASEAN's commitments to engage CSOs, officials have
found it rather straightforward to rhetorically embrace civil society
consultations while constraining participation in practice, described
below. By considering norms as explanatory variables, where norms
themselves are understood to generate the appropriate change in
behaviour, constructivism is impoverished in explaining why an actor
that adopts a norm does not alter its behaviour, and more so over time,
as seen in the ASEAN case. In light of the limitations of dominant IR
theories in explaining how and why governance institutions consult CSOs,
this study harnesses political economy analysis to explain this trend.
Recognising that different systems of structuring civil society
participation produce varying opportunities for CSOs to shape policy,
this article applies the framework of Jayasuriya and Rodan (2007), where
modes of participation serve as the unit of analysis. A mode of
participation is the 'institutional structures and ideologies that shape
the inclusion and exclusion of individuals and groups in the political
process' (Jayasuriya & Rodan, 2007, p. 774). This framework recognises
that institutions structure the form politics can take, making
particular forms of participation acceptable. As such, modes of
participation organise conflicts because they determine which conflicts
are 'expressed, mediated or marginalized' (Jayasuriya & Rodan, 2007, p.
779). In analysing modes of participation, this approach is concerned
with the questions of who is represented within these sites, what forms
of participation are deemed permissible, the struggles that have taken
place to establish these spaces, and whose interests are furthered
through their creation. In examining who can participate and how, the
key consideration is whether participation enables CSOs to contest
policy, defined as the articulation of views that challenge
institutional policy. This analytical focus is crucial because
participation that entails representation but not contestation functions
in legitimating prevailing interests, without providing a channel for
CSOs to deliberate policy, thereby marginalising the conflicts CSOs have
organised around. The modes of participation framework is drawn from the
work of social conflict theorists, considering institutions, markets,
and states not as unitary, independent, and coherent entities but as
social structures, meaning they are defined by conflicts among competing
social forces. ASEAN's Engagement of Civil Society 369 Recognising that
civil society consultations do not emerge independently but are shaped
by struggles between competing social forces, this framework
acknowledges these struggles as significant in determining how CSOs
participate in policy-making. This framework thus enables analysis of
the relationship between the structure of these spaces and the interests
they privilege. Hence, this framework not only describes modes of
participation as being more or less useful for activists' agendas, but
explains why, with reference to underlying political economy
relationships. This article extends the modes of participation framework
from Jayasuriya and Rodan's (2007) application to domestic regimes to
examine the relationship between CSOs and regional and global governance
institutions. This extension of this framework is based on recognition
that state borders do not constitute a boundary for political power, and
actors will employ strategies to advance their interests across
governance scales (Jessop, 1990). Each territorial scale, whether local,
subnational, national, regional, or global, has a specific configuration
of actors, resources, and political opportunities, and actors
subsequently seek to rescale the governance of an issue in accordance
with their interests (Hameiri & Jones, 2012). Consequently, the
governance of a single territorial scale cannot be examined in isolation
from others---domestic political projects are intricately bound up with
the form and trajectory of regional and global governance institutions.
Jayasuriya and Rodan's interest in modes of participation was drawn from
their examination of the emergence of a paradoxical trend in Southeast
Asia where increasing political representation has been accompanied by a
decline in opportunities for political contestation. They argue that the
narrowing of opportunities for political contestation is linked to
efforts to co-opt, marginalise, or exclude social forces that have
emerged around issues associated with the rapid and predatory mode of
capitalist development prevalent in the region, such as groups focusing
on environmental conservation, social justice, and public sector reform.
The Southeast Asian civil society sector is one such social force.
Activism has grown in response to governments' pursuit of a 'growth at
all costs' agenda, carried out through authoritarian state behaviour.
Issues that have been the consequence of this approach to state
management, such as the commercialisation of endangered species, the
mismanagement of shared resources, poor working conditions, child
trafficking, and sex tourism, have increasingly been addressed by CSOs.
Meanwhile, the common circumstances that these issues arose from across
countries have provided fertile ground for CSOs to organise at the
regional level. The regionalisation of activism is evident in the
establishment of regional networks targeting ASEAN and the development
of ASEAN-focused activities in existing networks (such as by having a
staff member or 'desk' responsible for tracking ASEAN developments),
seen in the Southeast Asian Committee for Advocacy (SEACA), the
Southeast Asian Women's Caucus on ASEAN, FORUM-ASIA, and the Asian
Partnership for the Development of Human Resources in Rural Asia
(AsiaDHRRA), to name a few. Leaders of regional networks have come
together to form the Solidarity for Asian People's Advocacy (SAPA)
network that spearheads advocacy targeting ASEAN (Gerard, 2013). CSOs'
activities targeting ASEAN include SAPA's annual organisation of the
ASEAN Civil Society Conference, held since 2005, as well as various
issue-specific collaborations in the form of workshops, publications,
and seminars. ASEAN's reform programme has prompted CSOs to pursue
engagement and vocally criticise ASEAN's policies. CSOs have also
targeted ASEAN in response to its claims that it is becoming more
'people-centred'. Prior to ASEAN's claims that it was widening
participation to include CSOs, many activists did not seek to interact
with ASEAN, instead '\[paying\] much more attention to the threats posed
by international organizations' (Chandra, 2006, p. 74). 370 K. Gerard
While some CSOs have increasingly made ASEAN a target of their
advocacies, not all have embraced this change. A vast spectrum of views
regarding the value of targeting ASEAN exists, from those that view
engaging ASEAN as equivalent to their co-optation to those that consider
engagement beneficial and devote resources to encouraging other CSOs to
do the same. Many CSOs choose not to pursue their claims directly by
participating in spaces established by ASEAN and instead seek to contest
policy through activities outside of these spaces, such as through
participation in the ASEAN Civil Society Conferences, the publication
and dissemination of critical knowledge, or organising protests
alongside ASEAN meetings (Gerard, 2013, 2014a). In explaining the form
and function of ASEAN's shift to include CSOs in policy-making, the
following section examines who is represented within these sites, what
forms of participation are deemed permissible, the struggles that have
taken place in establishing these modes of participation, and their
implications for relevant interests. CSO Participation in
ASEAN-Established Channels CSO Affiliation The system of affiliation
dates back to 1979, when ASEAN first certified the Federation of ASEAN
Public Relations Organizations and the ASEAN Bankers Association (ASEAN,
2009). The system operates by groups that meet particular criteria being
granted affiliation, which brings with it the opportunity for some forms
of participation. The guidelines governing the affiliation system were
first agreed in 1979 and revised in 2006 and again in 2011, with the
current version adopted by the Committee of Permanent Representatives
(CPR) on 5 November 2012. Affiliation is granted only to those
organisations that meet stringent requirements. According to the 2012
guidelines, affiliated CSOs must be non-profit organisations committed
to achieving the aims of ASEAN, with membership confined to member
states. In their application for affiliation, CSOs must disclose their
reasons for applying, details of their activities and membership, their
constitution and registration papers, and background information on
staff. All applications for affiliation must receive the approval of all
member states, through the CPR. Additional to these formal criteria,
officials noted that it is preferred if applicants conduct their
activities across all member states, and do not operate outside of
Southeast Asia or have extensive links (through funding and/or staff)
with international organisations or non-ASEAN governments.3 These
rigorous criteria are beyond the reach of many Southeast Asian CSOs,
frequently lacking financial and decision-making reporting systems
(Chong, 2011, p. 14). These criteria bias the affiliation system towards
those organisations with formalised and legalised systems of operation,
privileging middle-class organisations, and groups that are linked to
states or other national (but not external) financiers. The additional
informal criterion that organisations operate across all member states
adds an extra tier to the hurdles of obtaining affiliation, given that
some Southeast Asian states adopt a hostile approach to civil society
operations, while the discretionary rejection of ties between accredited
CSOs and international organisations or foreign governments further
narrows the range of CSOs that fit this mould. Despite the hurdles that
must be passed for an organisation to gain affiliation, the forms of
participation that are granted through this mechanism are not
remarkable. Accredited CSOs can use the name 'ASEAN', display its flag
and emblem, and play the ASEAN anthem; they ASEAN's Engagement of Civil
Society 371 can submit written statements to their nominated sectoral
body; and the ASEAN Secretariat provides them with ASEAN publications
each year. Affiliated CSOs can apply to receive Third Party funding for
relevant projects, attend meetings of its sectoral body, initiate
programmes of activities for consideration by its sectoral body, access
relevant ASEAN documents for research, and use the ASEAN Secretariat
facilities in Jakarta (ASEAN, 2012). The only form of participation that
is guaranteed through affiliation is the ability to submit written
statements to the CPR---all other forms of participation must be
requested in writing, and there are no procedures to question a decision
if an application is rejected. Furthermore, there are no processes to
ensure the transparency of decision-making associated with affiliation
applications or requests for particular forms of participation. CSOs
were hopeful that the most recent review would create a more
participatory system.4 However, officials indicated that the review was
intended only to change the wording of the guidelines such that they
align with the structural changes in ASEAN that were endorsed with the
Charter, rather than marking an entirely new mode of engagement.5 The
2012 guidelines do, however, include an additional obligation for
affiliated CSOs, namely that their activities comply with the national
laws of relevant countries (ASEAN, 2012, article 8). The 2012 guidelines
also stipulate that the CPR conduct a review every three years of
affiliated CSOs, and revoke affiliation for any organisation that does
not meet their obligations or undertakes activities that are contrary to
ASEAN and member states' aims (ASEAN, 2012, articles 10 -- 11). CSOs can
appeal the CPR's decision to revoke their affiliation; however, their
appeal must be directed to the CPR, and 'upon appeal, the decision of
the CPR shall be final and binding' (ASEAN, 2012, article 13), thereby
aligning the appeals process with the interests of the CPR, rather than
CSOs. Affiliation may increase CSOs' access to ASEAN officials; however,
this access continues only if CSOs do not challenge policy. This is
because to maintain their affiliation CSOs must retain the favour of the
CPR, as part of the review process conducted every three years. This can
limit CSOs' range of possible responses to ASEAN policies, reducing the
incentive for affiliated organisations to challenge policy. This was
recognised by Land Watch Asia, in its pamphlet titled Engaging the
ASEAN: Towards a Regional Advocacy on Land Rights. When describing the
affiliation system this pamphlet advises, 'NGOs need to assess whether
ASEAN views them as a partner or merely as a consultative body; that is,
whether NGOs can define their own agenda or simply adopt ASEAN's own
agenda' (Land Watch Asia, n.d.). The limited scope for participation
that is engendered through the affiliation system has meant that it
includes only one CSO that is widely respected in the activist
community, namely AsiaDHRRA. The list of affiliated CSOs is dominated by
professional bodies, such as the ASEAN Bankers Association and the ASEAN
Cosmetics Association, and the inclusion of the ASEAN Kite Council and
the ASEAN Vegetable Oils Club has made it a source of ridicule for
critics, such as Suryodiningrat (2009) who argues it displays 'the
intent by which ASEAN perceives its subjects: with ridicule and
condescension'. Ad hoc Consultations The ad hoc consultations with CSOs
that have been conducted by some ASEAN bodies provide an insight into
the limited forms of participation permitted in ASEAN policy-making and,
importantly, the struggles between conflicting interests in defining how
these consultations should be structured. 372 K. Gerard The inaugural
occurrence of this mode of participation took place in July 2005, when
the Secretary-General at the time, Ong Keng Yong, demonstrated an
interest in holding a dialogue with CSOs. A meeting was subsequently
held between Secretariat officials and representatives of three
high-profile CSOs, namely AsiaDHRRA, SEACA, and FORUM-ASIA (Ramirez,
2008). At this meeting, officials encouraged the representatives of
these three CSOs to jointly organise in seeking to engage ASEAN, and
indicated that their contributions to regional policy-making would be
welcomed. At this time, support among officials for the notion of
consulting CSOs was at an all-time high, evident in the in-principle
support officials granted to the holding of the first ASEAN Civil
Society Conference alongside the Leaders' Summit in December 2005 in
Kuala Lumpur (Gerard, 2013). Representatives of these three CSOs agreed
to collaborate in their efforts to engage ASEAN. They subsequently held
a meeting in October 2005 with other CSOs, where they agreed they would
collaborate in organising the ASEAN Civil Society Conference. This first
meeting between high-level Secretariat staff and representatives of
three CSOs created an important precedent that was taken up by other
ASEAN bodies. The next ad hoc consultation was held during the drafting
of the Charter in 2006, led by the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) on the
ASEAN Charter. The EPG comprised one representative from each member
state that was nominated by their respective governments, generally
comprising ministers or diplomats, with some retired and others serving
(ASEAN, 2006). They were given the task of '\[putting\] forth bold and
visionary recommendations on the drafting of an ASEAN Charter' (ASEAN,
2005). This expansive mandate was reflected in the EPG's terms of
reference, which noted the EPG could conduct 'region-wide consultations
of all relevant stakeholders in ASEAN in the ASEAN Charter drafting
process, especially representatives of the civil society' (ASEAN, 2005,
section 4). This recommendation did not specify the extent of
consultation to be undertaken, but it provided latitude for the EPG to
meet with CSOs. Hence, alongside ASEAN's customary consultations with
business groups and the ASEAN -- ISIS think-tank network, the EPG also
invited representatives of the SAPA network to a meeting from 27 to 29
June 2006 on the drafting of recommendations for the ASEAN
Political-Security Community. While it was not invited to subsequent
meetings, SAPA submitted its views on the Economic Community on 28 June
in Singapore, and on the Socio-Cultural Community and Institutional
Mechanisms on 10 November in Manila, and then submitted a final set of
seven recommendations through the Philippine EPG representative that
reiterated its previous submissions (Solidarity for Asian People's
Advocacy, 2006). The SAPA submissions recommended incorporating
environmental sustainability, human rights, and human security into the
Charter, among other proposals regarding reforming institutional
practices of consensus and non-interference. Chandra (2005) notes that
only three EPG members were active in responding to SAPA's submissions,
namely Tan Sri Musa Hitam of Malaysia, Ali Alatas of Indonesia, and
Fidel Ramos of the Philippines---notably most of ASEAN's
post-authoritarian members who faced a stronger imperative to respond to
claims for reform from domestic CSOs. While the EPG report included some
of SAPA's recommendations---[importantly, its call for civil society
consultation to be institutionalised---it emphasised CSOs' role as
raising ASEAN's profile among Southeast Asian citizens, rather than in
informing policy.]{.underline}6 The High-Level Task Force (HLTF) drafted
the final version of the Charter and, like the EPG, comprised a
representative from each member state, appointed by state leaders.
However, while the EPG comprised a mix of retired and serving officials,
9 of the 10 HLTF representatives were serving officials, making them
'speak for their governments and related ministries and nobody ASEAN's
Engagement of Civil Society 373 else' (Chongkittavorn, 2007). The Terms
of Reference of the HLTF did not specify any form of consultation to be
undertaken, with the exception that the HLTF could consult members of
the EPG if necessary (ASEAN, 2007c). However, the Philippines and Thai
representatives pushed for a meeting with CSOs, which took place on 27
March 2007 in Manila, with 60 representatives of Southeast Asian CSOs
(ASEAN, 2007b). At this meeting SAPA representatives again reiterated
their three submissions on each of the proposed ASEAN communities, some
of which had been included in the EPG report. However, these
contributions were not included in the final version of the Charter.7
The Charter mentions the term 'civil society' only once and in reference
to the role of the ASEAN Foundation, which would collaborate with CSOs
'to support ASEAN community building' (ASEAN, 2007a). The ASEAN
Foundation's interactions with CSOs, however, are limited to its
provision of IT training courses---this interaction, therefore, not
creating the opportunity for political participation.8 The Charter did
not expand civil society participation beyond the limits of the
affiliation system: it specifies that entities that support the ASEAN
Charter may engage with ASEAN; however, this same section then refers to
an Appendix detailing the list of affiliated CSOs, thereby limiting
participants to those with affiliation. The Charter thus codified civil
society participation in ASEAN as being limited to the affiliation
system. The language of ASEAN's proclaimed 'people-focus' also changed
with the Charter. The EPG used 'people-centred' in its report; however,
the Charter used 'people-oriented', this being a weaker version of the
first. The decision to include 'people-oriented' rather than
'people-centred' in the Charter signalled a subtle downgrading of
ASEAN's participatory agenda from previous pronouncements, given
reservations among officials regarding the latter term's greater
inclusivity (Chandra, 2009, p. 10; Nesadurai, 2011, p. 173). Through the
consultations conducted by the EPG and the HLTF on the Charter,
opportunities were created for CSOs to contribute their views to this
important document. However, the relevant ASEAN bodies set the terms of
these consultations and created space for CSOs' views to be represented
but not advanced through their inclusion in the Charter. When
Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan commenced his appointment on 1 January
2008, he made known his support for civil society engagement from the
outset by speaking at the SAPA Annual General Forum in Bangkok on 4
February 2008 where he 'showed an openness to civil society advocacies
and stressed opportunities for cooperation' (Lopa, 2009). Pitsuwan held
a meeting with CSOs and Secretariat officials on 5 March 2008 that
'explored windows of ASEAN engagement for civil society and laid down
civil society plans for engaging the ASEAN' (Lopa, 2009). He then led
the organisation of a conference, from 23 to 25 February 2009, to
explore processes of stakeholder engagement in other regional
organisations. It was attended by ASEAN and state officials, officials
from other regional organisations, and representatives from 18 Southeast
Asian CSOs. Pitsuwan also pushed consultations with CSOs on the
sensitive issue of human rights. Article 7.1 of the ASEAN
Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights' (AICHR) Terms of Reference
states that the Secretary-General may 'bring relevant issues to the
attention of the AICHR' (ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human
Rights, 2009). To inform his recommendations to the AICHR, Pitsuwan
sought to meet with representatives of regional human rights
organisations. He first proposed a meeting in 2009 and, anticipating
that such a meeting would be opposed by some member states, he
approached an ASEAN -- ISIS think tank, the Centre for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta, to ask for their assistance in
facilitating the meeting. In the lead-up to the meeting, news of its
occurrence reached the CPR and some responded with harsh criticisms.9
Pitsuwan nonetheless went ahead with the 374 K. Gerard meeting where
CSOs presented him with a statement of their concerns that they wanted
him to raise with the AICHR; however, he asked participants not to
publicise the dialogue's occurrence.10 The following year, CSOs were
informed that a similar meeting would not be possible because of the
Secretary-General's hectic schedule; however, in 2011 Pitsuwan again
approached the CSIS to assist in organising a meeting with regional
human rights organisations. Again, in the lead-up to the meeting word of
its occurrence spread among officials. However, this time some officials
from ASEAN's post-authoritarian states indicated their desire to attend.
Their attendance heightened the meeting's significance; however,
classifying it as 'informal' meant that the consensus of member states
was not necessary in order for it to proceed. These two meetings created
space for human rights organisations to dialogue with officials on this
highly sensitive topic. [The struggles over its establishment highlight
the opposition among officials to engaging CSOs in policy-making,
particularly on the contentious issue of human rights---an issue that
conflicts with the interests of some officials. These meetings did not,
however, advance the claims of CSOs regarding ASEAN's human rights
commitments, seen in the persistent ineffectuality of the AICHR
(Solidarity for Asian People's Advocacy Working Group on ASEAN and Human
Rights, 2012). The other ASEAN body that has held consultations with
CSOs is the ASEAN Committee on the Promotion and Protection of the
Rights of Women and Children (ACWC). The ACWC was formed in 2010
following the birth of this idea in the Vientiane Action Programme in
2004]{.underline} (article 1.1.4.7), as well as all member states
ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. It comprises two representatives from each ASEAN member state,
one concerned with women's issues and the other with children's issues.
There is some support among ACWC representatives for consulting CSOs
regarding its policies, given that some of its representatives
previously or currently are employed in the civil society sector.11 The
ACWC first held a consultation with CSOs on the drafting of its Terms of
Reference on 29 April 2009 where a civil society representative spoke
about relevant civil society activities and potential areas for
collaboration with the ACWC (FORUM-ASIA, 2010). CSOs that had shown an
interest in meeting with members of the ACWC, whether by having
contacted the Chair or the Committee's national representatives, were
invited to attend. The ACWC has subsequently held a number of informal
consultations with CSOs, with participation open to all organisations
wishing to contribute. Some ACWC representatives were opposed to meeting
with CSOs, so the preference has been to keep meetings informal so that
discussions cannot be publicised and ACWC representatives' attendance
remains optional. One ACWC representative reported that there has been
increasing enthusiasm and willingness from representatives to meet with
CSOs: 'At the beginning it was very informal \... those who felt like
engaging did \... This time around, we were all there, and we all had to
say something about what we did. I think that was very productive.'12
ACWC representatives also reported that they regarded these informal
meetings to be an improvement on their previous encounters with
activists. One ACWC representative noted activists would hang around
when we have formal meetings, they wait for you in the lobby or they
follow you to the restroom. Always they would know where I'm staying,
they are so good at spying on where I'm staying. In the middle of the
night they are knocking on the door.13 Structured informal consultations
with CSOs thus were attractive to ACWC representatives by overcoming
such issues. ASEAN's Engagement of Civil Society 375 It is evident that
the efficacy of the ad hoc consultations for CSOs depends on whether
these interactions are classified as formal or informal. When regarded
as formal, such as the consultations for the Charter, they require the
approval of all member states, which functions in delimiting civil
society participation. When classified as informal, a much freer
dialogue has taken place. However, the informality of such interactions
also limits their potential to shape ASEAN policy, as consensus among
all member states is needed to endorse any proposed policy changes.
Meanwhile, the personalities at the helm of ASEAN organs that have
pursued consultations with CSOs have been instrumental in ensuring these
interactions have taken place, and hence their continuation cannot be
guaranteed. As such, these ad hoc consultations have functioned in
creating spaces for dialogue between officials and CSOs, but they have
not prompted changes to ASEAN policies in accordance with CSOs' agendas.
GO-NGO Forums The third participatory mechanism established by ASEAN for
CSOs are the annual GO-NGO forums that have been established by the
ASEAN bodies for Migrant Labour, Social Welfare and Development, and
Rural Development and Poverty Eradication ('GO-NGO' referring to
government organisation/non-governmental organisation). These forums are
held prior to the annual meeting of the relevant sectoral ministers'
meeting and they are intended to create the opportunity for officials
and CSOs to engage in a dialogue. These forums generally comprise a
number of panels, after which participants divide into discussion groups
that put forward recommendations based on their discussions. A drafting
team made up of moderators, rapporteurs, and forum organisers then
consolidates these recommendations, which are presented to participants
in a plenary session for debate. Finally the recommendations are
submitted to the relevant ministers for discussion at their annual
meeting. In the case of the Social Welfare and Development forum, it was
first held from 7 to 9 September 2006 in Bangkok. The forum rotates
annually among ASEAN states, and its organisation is shared between the
Social Welfare Ministry of the host country, the ASEAN Secretariat and
the International Council on Social Welfare, which is a global network
of social welfare organisations. The organisation of the migrant labour
forum is shared between the Labour Ministry of the host country, the
ASEAN Secretariat, and the International Labour Organisation. It
provides a forum for dialogue between government officials, workers' and
employers' organisations, CSOs, and relevant international organisations
such as the International Organisation on Migration. The first was held
in Manila from 24 to 25 April 2008 and was organised as a follow-up
meeting to the ASEAN Leaders Declaration on the Promotion and Protection
of the Rights of Migrant Workers that was signed at the 12th ASEAN
Summit in Cebu in January 2007. The Senior Officials' Meeting on Rural
Development and Poverty Eradication then decided to hold an equivalent
forum, with the first held in Da Nang on 12 June 2012. It was organised
by the ASEAN Secretariat in collaboration with the state host, the
Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and attended
by relevant ASEAN officials, CSOs, and representatives of the Food and
Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations
Development Programme, and the Asian Development Bank (AsiaDHRRA, 2012).
Across these GO-NGO forums, civil society participants are invited to
attend rather than participation being open to those that wish to
participate. While the list of invited participants extends beyond those
that are affiliated with ASEAN, an informal system of selecting
participants whose interests are deemed to align with ASEAN operates.14
In this informal system of 376 K. Gerard selecting participants, each
country compiles a list of organisations they wish to invite. Each list
is considered by members of the CPR and if any of the nominated invitees
are deemed contentious by a member state, they will be removed from the
list, as noted by an ASEAN official: 'We never know, some organisations
are blacklisted in some countries. So as long as all 10 member states
are agreeable to engage with certain organisations, although they are
not affiliated, that should be fine.'15 The invitees remaining on the
list are subsequently asked to participate. Given that all participants
must receive the endorsement of all member states, ASEAN closely
regulates which CSOs can participate in the GO-NGO forums. Many of the
participants of these forums are GONGOs (government-organised
non-governmental organisations), these being groups that are established
and/or maintained by states. While the distinction between a GONGO and
an independent CSO varies across countries, as does the extent of
governmental control over their activities, organisations with a more
contentious agenda and grassroots groups are generally not represented
in the GO-NGO forums. Participation is largely restricted to nationally
accredited CSOs, which, like the affiliation system, is biased towards
organisations with formalised and legalised systems of operation and
groups that do not contest national policies and maintain the favour of
their governments. Through this system of regulating who can
participate, these forums function in embedding prevailing institutional
interests by creating a veneer of inclusiveness through dialogues
between CSOs and officials, while ensuring that those groups that do not
support these prevailing interests cannot attend. Additionally, these
forums provide a site for the representation of interests that are
aligned with ASEAN's market-building reforms or particular state
objectives. One example is the 192 recommendations that were put forward
by the SAPA Task Force on ASEAN and Migrant Workers in May 2009, just
prior to the 2nd ASEAN Forum on Migrant Labour in July (Southeast Asia
Regional Cooperation in Human Development \[SEARCH\], 2010). A regional
migrant workers advocacy organisation, SEARCH, noted that three out of
the four government delegations that comprised the Drafting Committee of
the ASEAN Committee on Migrant Workers used this document as their
primary source of information (SEARCH, 2010). More significantly,
however, of these three governments, the Indonesian and Philippine
delegations adopted approximately 60 per cent of the recommendations
into their initial bargaining positions (SEARCH, 2010). The alignment of
the interests of the Indonesian and Philippine delegations with more
than half of the recommendations put forward by the SAPA task force
reflected the status of these two states as two of the three major
intra-region sending countries for migrant workers, the third being
Myanmar. These countries' views on the promotion and protection of the
rights of migrant workers frequently conflict with those of recipient
countries, the three largest in Southeast Asia being Malaysia, Thailand,
and Singapore. This is because sending countries advocate for recipient
countries to improve oversight of the working conditions of migrant
workers employed in these states, and recipient states bear the cost of
these regulations. Thus, through participation, CSOs in this instance
provided information; however, it was only adopted by those states whose
interests it supported, while the conflicts between states over the
regulations governing migrant workers meant that CSOs' views were not
incorporated into regional policy. More generally, through the selection
of which CSOs can participate and the limited influence their
contribution has on regional policy, these participatory mechanisms
function in legitimating ASEAN policy by sustaining its participatory
rhetoric, while ensuring that groups cannot challenge policy or advance
alternative ideas through these spaces. ASEAN's Engagement of Civil
Society 377 Conclusion: Modes of Participation in Evaluating CSOs'
Influence in Policy-making Like many regional and global governance
institutions**[, ASEAN has committed to widening policy-making to
include CSOs. Through ad hoc consultations and the GO-NGO forums, ASEAN
has established two new participatory mechanisms in support of its
'people-centred' approach to regional integration, alongside the
existing affiliation system. Using the modes of participation framework
to explain their form and function,]{.underline}** this article has
examined these participatory channels. These three modes of
participation share three characteristics that function in preventing
CSOs from using these channels to contest policy or advance policy
alternatives. First, [regulations over who can participate in these
spaces ensure that CSOs working on contentious issues and groups that
vocally criticise policy are excluded]{.underline}. This is evident in
two of these three opportunities, namely the affiliation system and the
GO-NGO forums, being structurally biased towards the inclusion of
organisations that are well-resourced, have formalised systems of
operation, and do not vocally criticise ASEAN or state policy. Given
that the CPR determines which CSOs can participate in these two spaces,
dissenting voices are readily excluded. The ad hoc consultations
conducted by various ASEAN bodies remain outside the control of the CPR,
and consequently provide the opportunity for participation by groups
seeking to contest policy. However, the informal status of the ad hoc
consultations, which permits the inclusion of such groups, also ensures
that these deliberations are unlikely to have any impact on policy,
given that all policy decisions require the endorsement of all member
states. Second, strict controls over the nature of participation in
these channels narrow the possible contributions by participants. The
only form of participation guaranteed by the affiliation system is the
ability to submit written statements to the CPR, restricting the
potential for affiliated organisations to influence, or even deliberate,
policy. The GO-NGO forums hold opportunities for participants to contest
policy. However, the actual reform of policy relies on any
recommendations gaining the full support of member states. As described
in the case of the SAPA Task Force on ASEAN and Migrant Workers, while
some of its recommendations for ASEAN's policy regulating the rights of
migrant workers received the support of labour source countries, these
were not supported by labour recipient countries, resulting in no
substantive change to regional policy according to the agendas of CSOs.
For the ad hoc consultations, the restrictions governing participation
are shaped by whether a consultation is regarded as formal or informal.
Formal gatherings remain tightly controlled affairs where opportunities
for CSOs to deliberate policy are minimised, such as in the case of the
Charter consultations. As informal meetings do not require the approval
of the CPR, a more open and deliberative dialogue can take place, such
as in the case of the meetings initiated by Pitsuwan on human rights.
However, again, the informal nature of such consultations means they are
unlikely to prompt policy reforms in accordance with CSOs' objectives.
Meanwhile, their occurrence has also been heavily influenced by the
personalities at the helm of the relevant ASEAN bodies and hence their
continuation is not assured. Third, the issue in question shapes the
boundaries of all three participatory mechanisms, as outlined by one
ASEAN official: If we are talking about poverty reduction or social
welfare of vulnerable groups, I think those are soft issues, no
hesitation from member states. But when we touch upon some sensitive
issues, like for example human rights \... then the interaction with
civil society is different.16 Those issues deemed 'sensitive' by
officials are those where CSOs' advocacy challenges the interests and
priorities of dominant social forces. These issues do not fall within
the remit of 378 K. Gerard concerns that are open for discussion between
officials and CSOs, because doing so would create channels for the
representation of dissenting views, supporting CSOs' claims for reform.
However, consultations with CSOs on non-contentious issues permit
officials to harness the contribution of organisations in support of its
market-building reforms. The issue-specific nature of ASEAN's approach
to engaging CSOs is evident in the GO-NGO forums, where ASEAN has
designated specific sectoral concerns for dialogue between officials and
civil society representatives, namely migrant labour, social welfare and
development, and rural development and poverty eradication, all of which
are relevant to ASEAN's programme for economic integration. However,
effective regional human rights protections are one concern that does
not align with this project, demonstrated in the opposition encountered
by Pitsuwan in attempting to meet with human rights CSOs. Conspicuously
absent from all opportunities for civil society participation are issues
deemed even more contentious by officials, given that they directly
oppose powerful interests, such as land evictions in Cambodia or
political reform in Myanmar. These issues, and the relevant CSOs, are
excluded from all spaces established by ASEAN for civil society
participation. These three features of ASEAN's approach to engaging
civil society demonstrate how ASEAN's 'people-centred' shift functions
in furthering prevailing institutional interests. [Permitting some
organisations to participate but limiting their ability to contest
policy, these participatory mechanisms are structured to legitimise
policy as testimony to ASEAN's 'people-centred' commitments while
excluding dissenting social forces. ASEAN engages CSOs in this manner
because its post-crisis engagement with civil society is directed
towards boosting its legitimacy and furthering its narrow reform agenda,
rather than creating opportunities for CSOs to contest this political
project.]{.underline} As argued by Carroll in his examination of the
World Bank's engagement practices, inclusive rhetoric is 'more than just
spurious lingo or clever spin' (2010, p. 7, emphasis in original). Such
rhetoric is designed to create legitimacy, in this instance, for ASEAN's
political project. This inclusive rhetoric creates legitimacy because it
is attached to the mechanisms that ASEAN has established to engage CSOs.
However, these mechanisms are structured to include those groups that
can advance ASEAN's set of narrow reforms, while circumscribing the
participation of non-amenable interests. In doing so, ASEAN's approach
to engagement functions in silencing its dissenters, who have become
increasingly organised and vocal. The limited means for CSOs to assert
their claims for reform through spaces established by ASEAN supports the
decision of some CSOs to avoid engaging ASEAN altogether and pursue
their agendas outside of such channels, where they contest the limited
formal opportunities for their participation. Applying the modes of
political participation framework to the ASEAN case has permitted a
systematic analysis of ASEAN's approach to engaging CSOs, and revealed
how participatory channels are structured to support its market-building
reforms. This framework draws into the analysis the conflicts that
define relations between CSOs and governance institutions, and the role
of prevailing institutional interests in structuring participatory
channels. **[Claims that participatory policy-making addresses
'democracy deficits' must be considered in light of how participatory
channels are structured---specifically, whether through participation
CSOs access not only opportunities for representation, but also the
means to contest policy or advance policy alternatives.]{.underline}**
As this article has demonstrated, **[the broader shift to engage CSOs in
regional and global policy-making should be viewed as creating sites for
contestation rather than being implicitly democratising.]{.underline}**

#### Its try or die for the perm -- not all knowledge of the West is unreliable - awareness of orientalism is key before effective engagement 

**Hamid 08'** Hamid Kbiri, Major, Royal Moroccan Air Force, "The
Influence of Orientalism on American Perceptions and Policies in the
Middle-East, April 2008, accessed 7/14/19,
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/12070695/The-Influence-of-Orientalism-on-American-Perceptions-and-Policies-in-the-MiddleEast> -
sfrrpt

In sum, Western perceptions of the Middle-East are largely informed by
Orientalism both as a cultural mode of thought and an academic
discipline. Depictions of Islam, the dominant religion, as a unitary and
aggressive civilization have reinforced such frightening ideas as the
clash of civilizations between a civilized West and an enraged
Middle-East. Orientalism as a long-standing tradition has played an
important role in shaping how the public, the Media and leaders, be they
military or civilians, have made sense of the Middle-East in America.
Views that Middle-Easterners are monolithic people thinking and
responding in monolithic ways conditioned by the teachings of a
monolithic Islam have influenced the policies and measures pursued by
America in this critical region. After all, leaders like scholars may
"attempt to reach a level of relative freedom from ... brute, everyday
reality, but they can never quite escape or ignore their involvement as
human subjects in their own circumstances." 193 While historians are
just beginning to explore the debilitating effect that cultural
assumptions have had on diplomatic relations with the Middle-East, 194
growing emphasis on cultural awareness in the US military seems to
translate a consciousness that the traditional Orientalist perception
paradigm has reached its limits. However, pinning the hope of achieving
an accurate understanding of Middle-Eastern peoples and their culture
exclusively on books that are in large part responsible of the existing
confusion --and that continue to feature on top of Military recommended
readings- might not be very helpful in achieving an accurate assessment
of the situation and therefore devising appropriate military strategies
or measures. Now, Orientalist driven behaviors or attitudes may just as
well contribute to a sort of perception dilemma (by analogy with
security dilemma.) In27  such a dilemma, Orientalism and Occidentalism
195 (Orientalism in reverse) would nurture one another to culminate in
the self-prophesized "Clash of Civilizations" -- that would be better
named the "Clash of Perceptions." Recommendations: Of course, [not all
the knowledge produced by academic Orientalism is unreliable. There are
certainly elements of truth in this knowledge, but one has to be at
least aware of the bias and the imperfections of its
approaches.]{.underline} Many of its methodologies are marred by
epistemological flaws and inconsistencies[. The shortcomings of the
Orientalist framework of interpretation include foregrounding aspects
and ignoring others and blaming socio-economic realities on religious or
racial defects. 196 While the Orientalist expertise should not be taken
nor rejected wholesale, there is a need to enlist the expertise of other
social science disciplines which have kept up with scientific and
technological development.]{.underline} Many Middle-East Studies
researchers have indeed adopted modern empirical tools such as surveys,
statistics and case studies to provide scientifically evidenced
explanations of what is going on in the Middle-East. 197 Orientalists'
authority should not be a free pass to issue overarching statements
about the Middle-East based only on their mastery of some of its
language and their ability to decipher a collection of dusty medieval
texts. The raging academic debate in Middle-East Studies is indicative
of the existence of contending visions of the Middle-East. To feed
officials or military leaders just one version of "the Middle-East" is
to limit their ability to effectively come to terms with the realities
they might encounter on the ground. [Curricula aimed at heightening
cultural awareness of this region should therefore include the works of
equally authoritative if not more serious and rigorous
academics]{.underline} 198 [presenting different approaches to this
region. Based on OIF,decision makers should not 'slavishly' embrace
Orientalists']{.underline} pronouncements [but rather take a28 
critical distance from their expertise. Awareness, at least, of the
existence of the Orientalist prism is a key step to successfully
engaging this increasingly important]{.underline} region in the world's
great political and economic affairs[. It is time to challenge the
conventional wisdom infused by Orientalism. It is time to think outside
the Orientalist box.]{.underline}

### AUTHOR INDITES

#### The pretentious use of language in Said's Orientalism renders his work meaningless his theory of orientalism becomes nonsense

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"FROM PRETENTIOUSNESS TO MEANINGLESSNESS [There are, as I shall show,
several contradictory theses buried in Said\'s impenetrable
prose,]{.underline} with its endless postmodern jargon (\"a universe of
representative discourse,\" \"[Orientalist discourse\" \[p. 71\]-and
some kind editor really ought to have explained to Said the meaning of
\"literally]{.underline}\" \[pp. 19, 87, 93, 138, 179, 218, 307\] and
the difference between scatalogical and eschatological \[p. 68\]), [and
pretentious language that often conceals some banal
observation,]{.underline} as when Said talks of \"textual attitude\"
(pp. 92-93), when all he means is \"bookish\" or \"bookishness.\"
Tautologies abound, as in \"the freedom of licentious sex\" (p. 190)." "
Or take these comments: Thus out of the Napoleonic expedition there
issued a whole series of textual children, from Chateaubriand\'s
Itineraire to Lamartine\'s Voyage en Orient to Flaubert\'s Salammbo, and
in the same tradition, Lane\'s Manners and Customs of the Modern
Egyptians and Richard Burton\'s Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to
al-Madinah and Meccah. What binds them together is not only their common
background in Oriental legend and experience but also their learned
reliance on the Orient as a kind of womb out of which they were brought
forth. If paradoxically these creations turned out to\[...\]" "be highly
stylized simulacra, elaborately wrought imitations of what a live Orient
might be thought to look like, that by no means detracts from their
strength of their imaginative conception or from the strength of
European mastery of the Orient, whose prototypes respectively were
Cagliostro, the great European impersonator of the Orient, and Napoleon,
its first modern conqueror. (pp. 87-88) [What does Said mean by \"out of
the Napoleonic expedition there issued a whole series of textual
children,\"]{.underline} except that these five very varied works were
written after 1798? [The pretentious language of textual children
issuing from the Napoleonic expedition covers up this obvious fact.
Perhaps there is a profound thesis hidden in the jargon, that these
works were somehow influenced by the Napoleonic expedition, inspired by
it, and could not have been written without it. But no such thesis is
offered]{.underline}. This arbitrary group consists of three Frenchmen,
two " "Englishmen-one work of romantic historical fiction, three travel
books, and one detailed study of modern Egyptians. Francois-Rene de
Chateaubriand\'s Itineraire (1811) describes superbly his visit to the
Near East; Voyage en Orient (1835) is Alphonse de Lamartine\'s
impressions of Palestine, Syria, and Greece; Salammbo (1862) is Gustave
Flaubert\'s novel of ancient Carthage; Edward William Lane\'s Manners
and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (1836) is a fascinating firsthand
account of life in Egypt, particularly Cairo and Luxor, written after
years of residence there (first 1825-28, then 1833-35); Richard
Burton\'s account of his audacious visit to Mecca was first published in
three volumes between 1855 and 1856. Lane and Burton both had perfect
command of Arabic, classical and colloquial, while the others did not,
and both, particularly Lane, made contributions to Islamic studies, but
not the three Frenchmen." "What do they conceivably have in common? Said
tells us that what binds them together is not only \"their common
background in Oriental legend and experience but also their learned
reliance on the Orient as a kind of womb out of which they were brought
forth.\" What is the background of Oriental legend that inspired Burton
or Lane? Was Flaubert\'s vivid imagination stimulated by \"Oriental
legend,\" and was this the same legendary material that inspired Burton,
Lane, and Lamartine? \"[Learned reliance on the Orient as a kind of
womb\" is yet another example of Said\'s pompous way of saying the
obvious, namely, that they were writing about an Orient of which they
had some experience and intellectual knowledge.]{.underline} "Why are
these disparate works \"imitations\"? Take Lane\'s and Burton\'s works:
They are both highly accurate accounts based on personal, firsthand
experience. They are not imitations of anything. James Aldridge in his
study Cairo (1969) called Lane\'s account \"the most truthful and
detailed account in English of how Egyptians lived and behaved.\"3
Burton\'s observations are still quoted for their scientific value in
such scholarly works as F. E. Peters\'s The Hajj.4 Said also says of
Lane, \"For Lane\'s legacy as a scholar mattered not to the Orient, of
course, but to the institutions and agencies of his European society\"
(p. 164). There is no \"of course\" about it, Lane\'s Arabic Lexicon (5
vols; 1863-74) is still one of the first lexicons consulted by any
Muslim scholars wishing to translate the Koran into English; scholars
such as Maulana Muhammad Ali, who began his English translation in 1909
and refers constantly to Lane in his copious footnotes, as does A. Yusuf
Ali in his 1934 translation. What is more, the only place where one can
still buy a reasonably priced copy of Lane\'s indispensable work of
reference is in Beirut-the edition published by the Librairie du Liban."
"[What profound mysteries are unraveled by Said\'s final tortuous
sentence? Count Alessandro Cagliostro]{.underline} was [a Sicilian
charlatan who traveled in Greece, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Rhodes, and
Malta. During his travels he is said to have acquired considerable
knowledge of the esoteric sciences, alchemy in particular. On his return
to Europe, Cagliostro was involved in many swindles and seems to have
been responsible for many forgeries of one kind or another, but he found
time to establish many masonic lodges and secret societies]{.underline}.
He died in prison in 1795. [He did not contribute anything whatsoever to
the scientific study of the Near or Middle East, either of its languages
or of its history or culture. He was not a distinguished Orientalist
in]{.underline} the way Lane was. Indeed, apart from his \"Letter to the
French People\" (1786), I do not think Cagliostro ever wrote anything
worthy of being called scientific, or of scholarly value. [Cagliostro,
according to Said, was the prototype of \"\[the above five authors\'\]
imaginative conception.\" Is he suggesting that they, too, fabricated
their entire knowledge of the Egypt, the Near East, and Arabia? If that
is what Said means, it is false, for reasons discussed
above.]{.underline} For Said\[...\]"" Napoleon was the prototype of the
\"strength of European mastery of the Orient,\" since he was the
Orient\'s first modern conqueror. This would be fine as a metaphor-Lane
and Burton mastered Arabic in the way Napoleon mastered Egypt-but
unfortunately, in the rest of his book Said seems to suggest something
far more literal and sinister in the complicity of Orientalists with the
imperial powers. "[Orientalism is peppered with meaningless sentences.
Take, for example, \"Truth, in short, becomes a function of learned
judgment, not of the material itself, which in time seems to owe its
existence to the Orientalist]{.underline}\" (p. 67). [Said seems to be
saying that \"truth\" is created by the experts or Orientalists, and
does not correspond to reality, to what is actually out there. So far,
so good. But then \"what is out there\" is also said to owe its
existence to the Orientalist.]{.underline} If that is the case, then the
first part of Said\'s sentence makes no sense, and if the first part is
true then the second part makes no sense. Is Said relying on that weasel
word \"seems\" to get him out of the mess? That ruse will not work
either, for what would it mean to say that an external reality
independent of the Orientalist\'s judgment also seems to be a creation
of the Orientalist? That would be a simple contradiction. "Here is
another example: \"The Orientalist can imitate the Orient without the
opposite being true.\" (p. 160). [Throughout his book, Said is at pains
to point out that there is no such thing as \"the Orient,\" which, for
him, is merely a meaningless abstraction concocted by Orientalists in
the service of imperialists and racists. In which case, what on earth
could \"The Orient cannot imitate the Orientalist\" possibly mean? If we
replace \"the Orient\" by the individual countriessay, those lying
between Egypt and India-do we get anything more coherent? No, obviously
not: \"India, Egypt, and Iran cannot imitate the Orientalists
l]{.underline}ike Renan, Bernard Lewis, Burton, et al.\" [We get
nonsense whichever way we try to gloss Said\'s sentence."]{.underline}

#### Said's conception of Orientalism is inherently contradictory rendering it meaningless 

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"At times, Said seems to allow that the Orientalists did attain genuine
knowledge of the Orient-its history, culture, languages-as when he calls
Lane\'s work Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians \"a classic of
historical and anthropological observation because of its style, its
enormously intelligent and brilliant details\" (p. 15); or when he talks
of \"a growing systematic knowledge in Europe about the Orient\" (p.
39), since Said does not have sarcastic quotation marks around the word
\"knowledge,\" I presume he means there was a growth in genuine "
"knowledge. Further on, [Said talks of Orientalism producing \"a fair
amount of exact positive knowledge about the Orient\" (]{.underline}p.
52). Again, I take it Said is not being ironical when he talks of
\"philological discoveries in comparative grammar made by Jones\" (p.
98). At one point, Said mentions Orientalism\'s \"objective
discoveries\" (p. 203). [Yet these acknowledgments of the discoveries
made by Orientalists are contradicted by Said\'s insistence that there
is no such thing as \"truth\"]{.underline} (p. 271), or when he
characterizes Orientalism as \"a form of paranoia, knowledge of another
kind, say, from ordinary historical knowledge\" (p. 73). [Or again, \"it
is finally Western ignorance which becomes more refined and complex, not
some body of positive Western knowledge which increases in size and
accuracy]{.underline}\" (p. 62). At one point [Said seems to deny that
the Orientalists had acquired any objective knowledge at all (p. 122),
and a little later he also writes, \"the advances made by a \`science\'
like Orientalism in its academic form are less objectively true than we
often like to think\"]{.underline} (p. 202). " It is true that the last
phrase does leave open the possibility that some of the science may be
true, though less than we had hitherto thought. Said also wholeheartedly
endorses Abdel Malek\'s strictures against Orientalism and its
putatively false \"knowledge\" of the Orient\" (p. 96-97). In his 1994
afterword, [Said insists that he has \"no interest in, much less
capacity for, showing what the true Orient and Islam really
are]{.underline}\" (p. 331). [And yet he contradicts this outburst of
uncharacteristic humility and modesty when he claims that \"\[the
Orientalist\'s\] Orient is not the Orient as it is, but the Orient as it
has been Orientalized\"]{.underline} (p. 104), for such a formulation
assumes [Said knows what the real Orient is. Such an assumption is also
apparent in his statement that \"the present crisis dramatizes the
disparity between texts and reality\"]{.underline} (p. 109). In order to
be able to tell the difference between the two, Said must know what the
reality is. [This is equally true when Said complains that \"\[t\]o look
into Orientalism for a lively sense of an Oriental\'s human or even
social reality \... is to look in vain]{.underline}\" (p. 176)."

#### Said's work is rooted within a method of self-pity that ignores his position of privilege to discuss the orient

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"SELF-PITY, POSTIMPERIALIST VICTIMHOOD, AND IMPERIALISM In order to
achieve his goal of painting the West in general, and the discipline of
Orientalism in particular, in as negative a way as possible, [Said has
recourse to several tactics. One of his preferred moves is to depict the
Orient as a perpetual victim of Western imperialism, dominance, and
aggression. The Orient is never seen as an actor, an agent with free
will or designs or ideas of its own. It is to this propensity that we
owe that immature and unattractive quality of so much contemporary
Middle Eastern culture, self-pity, and the belief that all its ills are
the result of imaginary Western-Zionist conspiracies.]{.underline}\"
Here is an example of Said\'s own belief in such conspiracies taken from
The Question of Palestine: \"It was perfectly apparent to Western
supporters of Zionism like Balfour that the colonization of Palestine
was made a goal for the Western powers from the very beginning of
Zionist planning: Herzl used the idea, Weizmann used it, every leading
Israeli since has used it. Israel was a device for holding Islam-later
the Soviet Union, or communism-at bay.\"16 So Israel was created to hold
"Islam at bay! As for the politics of victimhood, [Said has \"milked it
himself to an indecent degree.\"\" Said wrote: My own experiences of
these matters are in part what made me write this book. The life of an
Arab Palestinian in the West, particularly in America, is disheartening.
There exists here an almost unanimous consensus that politically he does
not exist, and when it is allowed that he does, it is either as a
nuisance or as an Oriental]{.underline}. The web of, cultural
stereotypes, political imperialism, dehumanizing ideology holding in the
Arab or the Muslim is very strong indeed, and it is this web which every
Palestinian has come to feel as his uniquely punishing destiny. (p. 27)
[Such wallowing in self-pity from a tenured and much-feted professor at
Columbia University, where he enjoyed privileges that we lesser mortals
only dream of]{.underline} (and a decent salary), [all the while spewing
forth hatred of the country that took him in and heaped honors on him,
is nauseating.]{.underline} As Ian Buruma concluded in his review of
Said\'s memoir, Out of Place, \"The more he dwells on his suffering and
his exile status, the more his admirers admire him. On me, however, it
has the opposite effect. [Of all the attitudes that shape a memoir,
self-pity is the least attractive.\"\"]{.underline}

#### Said's work is flawed from obscuring diversity and complexity, essentalization, lack of historical evidence, pretentious language, contradictory claims, misrepresenting the work of scholars, and misrepresenting the West

[In Defending the West, Ibn Warraq demonstrates that Said is guilty of
the major intellectual errors he ostentatiously decries in the
twenty-fifth anniversary edition preface]{.underline}: [obscuring the
diversity and complexity of lived experience by falsely ascribing
essential features to peoples and civilizations; and rendering
categorical moral and political judgments without the adequate
historical knowledge on which responsible judgment depends]{.underline}.
He shows that [Said routinely produces pretentious, meaningless, and
contradictory speech]{.underline}. Most notably, in the fashion of the
more glib postmodernism, Said stresses that \"the Orient\" does not
exist but is rather the paranoid construction of Western scholars.
[This, however, does not prevent him from blatantly contradicting
himself by positing that two centuries of study by scholars in Europe
and the U.S. have produced \"a growing systematic knowledge in Europe
about the Orient\" and \"a fair amount of exact positive knowledge about
the Orient.\"]{.underline} [Nor does it stop Said from decrying
Orientalists because contrary to his insistence that a real Orient does
not exist and contrary to his acknowledgment that the Orientalists have
gained substantial knowledge of it --- they have \"'no interest in, much
less capacity for, showing what the true Orient and Islam really are.\'
Said's case against the West is seriously flawed]{.underline}. Warraq
accuses [Said of not only willfully misinterpreting the work of many
scholars, but also of systematically misrepresenting Western
civilization as a whole]{.underline}. Charles Paul Freund in his article
"The end of the Orientalist critique" argues that Said in his book
Orientalism was a harsh interpretation of the West\'s attitude toward
just these matters, and the critique he established has since dominated
the intellectual appraisal of the West\'s political and cultural
relationship to the Muslim world and other peoples of the East. What was
Orientalism? Said identified it in his foundational work as the
political, cultural, and intellectual system by which the West has for
centuries \"managed\" its relationship with the Islamic world. The
central stratagem of this process has been reductionist
misrepresentation. In brief, according to [Said and the army of
intellectual critics and journalists who have come in his wake,
Orientalism transforms the East and its people into an alien \"Other.\"
That Other---usually a Dark Other---was in every way the inferior of the
West: unenlightened, barbarous, cruel, craven, enslaved to its senses,
given to despotism, and, in general, contemptible. Having established an
Eastern Other in these degrading terms, the West emerged at the center
of its self-serving discourse as, by obvious contrast, enlightened and
progressive.]{.underline}

### Alt Fails

#### Orientalism limits the possibility of self-examination for Muslims and the Arab orient and functioned as a form of intellectual terrorism that accuse Orientalists of being complicity with power 

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"And yet, ironically, what makes [self-examination for Arabs and
Muslims, and especially criticism of Islam in the West, very difficult
is the totally pernicious influence of Edward Said\'s
Orientalism.]{.underline}2 The latter work t[aught an entire generation
of Arabs the art of self-pity-]{.underline}\"were it not for the wicked
imperialists, racists and Zionists[,]{.underline} we would be great once
more\"-encour- aged the Islamic fundamentalist generation of the 1980s,
bludgeoned into silence any criticism of Islam, and even stopped dead
the research of eminent Islamologists [who felt their findings might
offend Muslim sensibilities and who dared not risk being labeled
\"Orientalist.]{.underline}\" The aggressive tone of [Orientalism
is]{.underline} what I have called \"[intellectual terrorism,\" since it
seeks to convince not by arguments or historical analysis, but by
spraying charges of racism, imperialism, and Eurocentrism from a moral
high ground;]{.underline} anyone who disagrees with Said has insult
heaped upon him. The moral high ground "; anyone who disagrees with Said
has insult heaped upon him. [The moral high ground is an essential
element in Said\'s tactics. Since he believes his position is morally
unimpeachable, Said obviously thinks he is justified in using any means
possible to defend it,]{.underline} including the distortion of the
views of eminent scholars, interpreting intellectual and political
history in a highly tendentious way-in short, twisting the truth. But in
any case, he does not believe in the \"truth.\" [Said attacks not only
the entire discipline of Orientalism]{.underline}, which is devoted to
the academic study of the Orient and which Said accuses of perpetuating
negative racial stereotypes, anti-Arab and anti-Islamic prejudice, and
the myth of an unchanging, essential \"Orient,\" [but he also accuses
Orientalists as being a group complicit with imperial power and holds
them responsible for creating the distinction between Western
superiority and Oriental inferiority, which they achieve by suppressing
the voice of the \"Oriental\" and by their antihuman tendency to make
huge, but vague, generalizations about entire populations that in
reality consist of millions of individuals]{.underline}. In other words,
much of what was written about the Orient in general, and Islam and
Islamic civilization in particular, was false. The Orientalists also
stand accused of creating \"the Other\"-the non-European, always
characterized in a negative way, as, for example, passive, weak, and in
need of civilizing by the advanced West (contrasting Western strength
with Eastern weakness). But \"Orientalism\" is also more generally \"a
style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological
distinction made between \`the Orient\' and (most of the time) \`the
Occident\"\' (p. " "2). [Thus, European writers of fiction, epics,
travel, social descriptions, customs, and people are all accused of
\"Orientalism.\"]{.underline} In short, [Orientalism is seen \"as a
Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over
the Orient]{.underline}.\" Said makes much of the notion of a discourse
derived from Michel Foucault, who argued that supposedly objective and
natural structures in society, which privilege some and punish others
for nonconformity, are in fact \"discourses of power.\" The putative
\"objectivity\" of a discipline covered up its real nature; disciplines
such as Orientalism participated in such discourses. Said continues,
\"\[W\]ithout examining Orientalism as a discourse one cannot possibly
understand the enormously systematic discipline by which European
culture was able to manage-even produce-the Orient politically,
sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically, and
imaginatively during the post-Enlightenment period\" (p. 3)."

#### Orientalism as a theory makes totalizing claims about the motives of western civilization, rather it is the western intellectual inquisitiveness that lead the east to rediscover their past and identity

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

"MISUNDERSTANDING OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION [The golden thread running
through Western civilization is rationalism]{.underline}. As Aristotle
said, \"Man by nature strives to know.\" This striving for knowledge
results in science, which is but the application of reason.
[Intellectual inquisitiveness is one of the hallmarks of Western
civilization.]{.underline} As J. M. Roberts put it, [The massive
indifference of some civilisations and their lack of curiosity about
other worlds is a vast subject]{.underline}. Why, until very recently,
did Islamic scholars show no wish to translate Latin or western European
texts into Arabic? Why, when the English poet Dryden could confidently
write a play focused on the succession in Delhi after the death of the
Mogul emperor Aurungzebe, is it a safe guess that no Indian writer ever
thought of a play about the equally dramatic politics of the English
seventeenth-century court? [It is clear that an explanation of European
inquisitiveness and adventurousness must lie deeper than economics,
important though they may have been. It was not just greed which made
Europeans feel they could go out and take the world. The love of gain is
confined to no particular people or culture.]{.underline} It was shared
in the fifteenth " "century by many an Arab, Gujarati or Chinese
merchant. Some Europeans wanted more. They wanted to explore 39
Marxists, Freudians, and anti-imperialists, who crudely reduce all human
activities to money, sex, and power, respectively, have difficulties in
understanding the very notion of disinterested intellectual inquiry.
[European man, by nature, strives to know. Science undoubtedly owed some
of its impetus to finding ways of changing base metal into gold and to
attempts to solve practical problems, but surely science owes as much to
the desire to know, to get at the truth. Th]{.underline}is is the reason
philosophers like Karl Popper have called it a spiritual achievement.
[Hence, the desperate attempts by Said to smear every single Orientalist
with the lowest of motives are not only reprehensible but also fail to
give due weight to this golden thread running through Western
civilization]{.underline}. " "One should also have reminded Said that
[it was this desire for knowledge on the part of Europeans that led the
people of the Near East to recover and discover their own past and their
own identity.]{.underline} In the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, ancient Syria,
ancient Palestine, and Iran were carried out entirely by Europeans and,
later, Americans. The disciplines of Egyptology, Assyriology, and
Iranology, all of which restored to mankind a large part of its
heritage, were the exclusive creations of inquisitive Europeans and
Americans-whereas, for doctrinal reasons, Islam deliberately refused to
look at its pre-Islamic past, which was considered a period of
ignorance.40"

#### **Orientalism essentializes the west as racist, imperialist, and ethnocentric this pushes western writers and scholars out of the discussion** 

**Warraq 07**

(Ibn Warraq, Founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic
Society and Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute, "Defending
the West: A Critique of Edward Said\'s Orientalism", DMW)

In a disingenuous 1994 afterword, [Said denies that he is anti-Western
and that the phenomenon of Orientalism is a synecdoche of the entire
West]{.underline}. He claims that [there is no such stable reality as
\"the Orient\" or \"the Occident,\" that there is no enduring Oriental
reality and even less an enduring Western essence]{.underline}, and that
he has no interest in, much less capacity for, showing what the true
Orient and Islam really are (pp. 330-33). But a close reading of
Orientalism is enough to show Said\'s anti-Westernism. While he does
occasionally use inverted commas around \"the Orient\" and \"the
Occident[,\" the entire force of Said\'s polemic comes from the polar
opposites and contrasts of the East and the West, the Orient and Europe,
Us and the Other, which he himself has crudely set up."]{.underline}
"Said wrote, \"I doubt that it is controversial, for example, to say
that an Englishman in India or Egypt in the later nineteenth century
took an interest in those countries that was never far from their status
in his mind as British colonies. To say this may seem quite different
from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow
tinged and impressed with, violated by, the gross political fact \[of
imperialism\]-and yet that is what I am saying in this study of
Orientalism\" (p. 11; emphasis in original). Here is [Said\'s
characterization of all Europeans: \"It is therefore correct that every
European, in what he could say about the Orient, was consequently a
racist, an imperialist, and almost " "totally
ethnocentric]{.underline}\" (p. 204). In other words, not only are all
Europeans racist, but they must necessarily be so. Said claims he is
explicitly antiessentialist, particularly about \"the West.\" But here
is Said again: \"Consider first the demarcation between Orient and West.
It already seems bold by the time of the Iliad. Two of the most
profoundly influential qualities associated with the East appear in
Aeschylus\'s The Persians, the earliest Athenian play extant, and in The
Bacchae of Euripides, the very last one extant\.... The two aspects of
the Orient that set it off from the West in this pair of plays will
remain essential motifs of European imaginative geography. A line is
drawn between two continents. Europe is powerful and articulate; Asia is
defeated and distant\" (pp. 56-57). As Keith Windschuttle comments on
that passage:" "[These same motifs persist in Western
culture,]{.underline} \[Said\] claims, right down to the modern period.
This is a tradition that accommodates perspectives as divergent as those
of Aeschylus, Dante, Victor Hugo, and Karl Marx. However, [in describing
\"the essential motifs\" of the European geographic imagination that
have persisted since ancient Greece, he is ascribing to the West a
coherent self identity that has produced a specific set of value
judgements-\"Europe is powerful and articulate: Asia is defeated and
distant\"-]{.underline}that have remained constant for the past 2,500
years. [This is, of course, nothing less than the use of the very notion
of \"essentialism\" that he elsewhere condemns so
vigorously]{.underline}. In short, it is his own work that is
essentialist " "[and ahistorical. He himself commits the very faults he
says are so objectionable in the work of Orientalists.\"]{.underline}
And here is another example to prove Said\'s anti-Western essentialism:
\"The Orient was Orientalized not only because it was discovered to be
\`Oriental\' in all those ways considered commonplace by an average
nineteenth-century European, but also because it could be-that is,
submitted to being-made Oriental\" (p. 6). Here we have Said\'s
reductionistic absurdity: the \"average nineteenth-century European.\"
[A part of Said\'s tactic is to leave out Western writers and scholars
who do not conform to his theoretical framework]{.underline}. Since, for
Said, [all Europeans are a priori racist, he obviously cannot allow
himself to quote writers who are not]{.underline}. Indeed, one could
write a parallel work to Orientalism made up of extracts from Western
writers, scholars, and travelers who were attracted by various aspects
of non-European cultures, which they praised and contrasted favorably
with their own decadence, bigotry, intolerance, and bellicosity."

#### Said's Orientalism fails to analyze the interactions between cultures and instead singles out Europe's failure to offer anything other than imperialism, racism, and ethnocentrism this leads to an eschewing of materialist analysis and provides a flawed critic of the middle east.

[Said in Orientalism never really tackles the problem of the proper
approach to \"other\" cultures and a sense of ambiguity and unresolved
dilemma persists with the reader.]{.underline} [Said sidesteps the issue
by saying that his purpose is not to displace the old system of
representations with a new one but simply to describe the context for
the rise and development of Orientalism and its
consequences.]{.underline} At one point, however, [Said writes that
\"human societies, or at least the most advanced cultures, have rarely
offered the individual anything but imperialism, racism, and
ethnocentrism in dealing with \'other\' cultures.\"]{.underline} Now, if
all \"advanced cultures\" (including the developing Oriental ones) share
this basic tendency, [why single out Europe\'s failure to rise above it
unless one assumes that because of its intellectual superiority and
cultural achievement the West should have been able to overcome this
natural human tendency. Said never says so outright, but one gets the
feeling that he is judging Europe not in terms of its own historical
reality and intellectual development, but in terms of the claims it
makes for itself as the arbitor and guardian of humanity\'s highest
values]{.underline}. And that is perhaps fair enough, since within the
Western intellectual tradition, modern Orientalism in a sense represents
a dinosaur, an outdated, fossilized theoretical edifice using language
and concepts better suited to the nineteenth century (Rassam 1980: 508).
If you study a culture or group of cultures having the character of the
\"Oriental,\" your study, as Edward Said\'s book points out, is itself
open to analysis as a manifestation of \"Western\" culture. A book which
indicates, as his does, that \"Western\" representations of the East
(beginning with the notion of the East itself) [have purposes which
relate to purely Western needs and projects can be seen in its turn as a
representation of Orientalism having purposes of its own, such as the
furtherance of Arab political causes]{.underline}. A review which points
these things out is itself asking to be reviewed [in terms of its own
representations and purposes Said, eschewing materialist analysis,
sought to apply literary critical methodology and to offer an analysis
specific to something called \'the Orient\'; the result is that the
issue of Orientalism, as debated in the Anglo-Saxon world over the past
decade and a half, has had relatively clear battle lines, familiar to
you all.]{.underline} On the one hand, the book of Edward Said advanced
a comprehensive critique of Western, particularly English, French and
American, writing on the Middle East, ranging from the eighteenth
century to the present day, and encompassing literature, history,
political and other sciences. Under the influence of Said\'s critique a
range of work has been produced, criticizing academic and other writing
on the region as, in various terms, Eurocentric, imperialist, racist,
essentialist, and so forth. On the other hand, **[a range of writers on
the region, most notably Bernard Lewis, have rebutted Said\'s charge and
argued for an approach which falls, to a greater or lesser extent, into
the \'Orientalist\' category]{.underline}** (Halliday 1983: 148). Said
would seem to engage in an injudicious elision namely, that treatment of
texts produced within the social sciences and in related activities such
as journalism or travel writing, and literature. [Of course, there are
similarities and mutual influences; but while one is a necessarily
fictional activity, without controls in reality or direct links to the
acts of administration, domination, exploitation, the former is so
controlled. To assume that the same critique of discourses within
literature can be made of those within social science is questionable;
it may indeed reflect the hubris, rather too diffuse at the moment, of
theorists deriving their validation from cultural studies. This brings
an area of difficulty with the critique of Orientalism, namely its
analysis, or rather absence thereof, of the ideas and ideologies of the
Middle East itself. Said himself has, in his other writings, been a
trenchant critic of the myths of the Middle East and of its politicians,
and nowhere more so than in his critique of the poverty of the
intellectual life of the Arab world]{.underline}: while the rulers have
constructed numerous international airports, he once pointed out, they
have failed to construct one good library. But the absence of such a
critique in his Orientalism does allow for a more incautious silence,
since it prevents us from addressing how the issues discussed by the
Orientalists and the relations between East and West are presented in
the region itself

#### Orientalism scholarship ignore the genuine contribution westerns have made to eastern cultures, holds a perception that only the west does these things to the east which ignores how societies interaction, and homogenizes the East and middle east

Because [Orientalism exists we have a world where reality is differently
perceived, expressed and experienced across a great divide of mutual
misunderstanding. To discuss Orientalism one has to urge people to go
beyond this misunderstanding and see what has been made invisible: to
distinguish a different outline in a picture that has been distorted by
centuries of myopic vision]{.underline}. There is nothing about
Orientalism that is neutral or objective. By definition it is a partial
and partisan subject. No one comes to the subject without a background
and baggage. The baggage for many consists of the assumption that, given
its long history, somewhere within or about this subject there is real
knowledge about the Orient; and that this knowledge can be used to
develop an understanding of the cultures East of the West. The task of
this book is to undermine this assumption[. While Orientalism is real,
it is still, nevertheless, an artificial construction. It is entirely
distinct and unattached to the East as understood within and by the
East. There is no route map, no itinerary locked within the subject to
bridge that divide. Said\'s account contains many factual,
methodological and conceptual errors.]{.underline} [Said ignores many
genuine contributions to the study of Eastern cultures made by
Westerners during the Enlightenment and Victorian eras]{.underline}.
Said\'s theory does not explain why the French and English pursued the
study of Islam in the 16th and 17th centuries, long before they had any
control or hope of control in the Middle East. Critics have noted Said
ignored the contributions of Italian, Dutch, and particularly the
massive contribution of German scholars. Lewis claims that the
scholarship of these nations was more important to European Orientalism
than the French or British, but the countries in question either had no
colonial projects in the Mideast (Dutch and Germans), or no connection
between their Orientalist research and their colonialism (Italians).
Said\'s theory also does not explain why much of Orientalist study did
nothing to advance the cause of imperialism (Lewis 1982: 52) [The
critique of Orintalism raises several genuine questions. A point made by
several critics is that the guiding principle of these studies is
expressed in the dictum "knowledge is power" and that Orientalists were
seeking knowledge of Oriental peoples in order to dominate them, most of
them being directly or objectively in the service of imperialism.
Another charge leveled against the Orientalists is that of bias against
the peoples they study, even of a built-in hostility to them. The most
important question least mentioned by the current wave of critics
--]{.underline} is that of the scholarly merits, indeed the scholarly
validity, of Orientalist findings. And Said has hardly touched on this
question and has indeed given very little attention to the scholarly
writings of the scholars whose putative attitudes, motives, and purposes
form the theme of his book Irwin\'s argument is that the field of
European research into Middle Eastern language, culture, and history was
by no means so tightly linked to Western imperial ambitions as
Orientalism suggests. [He is also very skeptical of the value of
analyzing Orientalist scholarship alongside Western literary texts
devoted to the East--- evading the distinctions between kinds of texts
by treating them all as manifestations of a colonialist
discourse]{.underline}. While acknowledging the great influence of
Orientalism on postcolonial theory since its publication in 1978, George
P. Landow - a professor of English and Art History at Brown University
in the United States - 2nd International Symposium on Sustainable
Development, June 8-9, 2010 Sarajevo 371 finds Said\'s scholarship
lacking. He chides Said for ignoring the non-Arab Asian countries,
non-Western imperialism, the Occidentalist ideas that abound in East
towards the Western, and gender issues. [Orientalism assumes that
Western imperialism, Western psychological projection, \"and its harmful
political consequences are something that only the West does to the East
rather than something all societies do to one another.\" Landow also
finds Orientalism\'s political focus harmful to students of literature
since it has led to the political study of literature at the expense of
philological, literary, and rhetorical issues Landow points out that
Said completely ignores China, Japan, and South East Asia, in talking of
\"the East,\" but then goes on to criticise the West's homogenisation of
the East. Furthermore, Landow states that Said failed to capture the
essence of the Middle East, not least by overlooking important works by
Egyptian and Arabic scholars]{.underline}. In addition to poor knowledge
about the history of European and non-European imperialism, another of
Landow's criticisms is that [Said sees only the influence of the West on
the East in colonialism]{.underline}. Landow argues that [these
influences were not simply one-way, but cross-cultural, and that Said
fails to take into account other societies or factors within the East.
He also criticises Said's \"dramatic assertion that no European or
American scholar could \`know\` the Orient]{.underline}.\" However, in
his view what they have actually done constitutes acts of oppression.
Moreover, one of the principal claims made by Landow is that Said did
not allow the views of other scholars to feature in his analysis;
therefore, he committed "[the greatest single scholarly sin" in
Orientalism]{.underline}.

#### ALT FAILS Orientalism is inevitable

**Hübinette- 03'** orientalist expert- has written many scholarly
articles relating orientalism and Western Dominance (Tobias,
"Orientalism Past and Present",
9/7/03, [http://www.tobias](http://www.tobias/) hubinette.se/orientalism.pd)//

Since the end of the 1970s[, most academic institutions in the West have
more or less accepted the critique on classical orientalism and tried to
distance themselves from their predecessors.]{.underline} Instead, it is
in the form of popular orientalism that the discourse has managed to
survive in the West as a romantic and colonial nostalgia reproduced in
arts, movies and literature. This kind of popular orientalism is for
example extremely well-represented in commercials here in Sweden. So
finally there is a time to ask ourselves- [is there a way out of
orientalism , and can we imagine a world beyond
orientalism?]{.underline} can we imagine a world beyond orientalism?
Well, my personal guess is that **[orientalism will always exist in one
or another form as long as the West has hegemonic
power.]{.underline}** **Orientalism is strongly intertwined with the
Western self-image to such an extant that if orientalism goes, then
Western world power or even the West itself must also
go**[.]{.underline} And isn´t that what we are seeing today, a slow but
unstoppable power shift from the West towards East Asia with China and
Japan in the forefront, maybe also South Asia with India as a leading
nation, while the academic world itself is undergoing of a rapid
Asianization, giving way to a more or less higher competence of higher
diaspora Asians in the subjects involved.

#### Orientalism's reductionism fails -- no empirical data or foundation

**Warraq 2007** (Ibn, Secularisation of Islamic Study Institute founder,
"Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism," )

Edward Said\'s Orientalism gave those unable to think for themselves a
formula. **[His work had the attraction of an]{.underline}** all-purpose
tool his acolyteseager, **[intellectually unprepared]{.underline}**,
aesthetically **[unsophisticated-could apply to every cultural
phenomenon without having to think critically or having to conduct any
real archival research]{.underline}** requiring mastery of languages, or
research in the field requiring the mastery of technique and a rigorous
methodology. Said\'s **[Orientalism displays all the laziness and
arrogance of the man of letters who does not have much time for
empirical research, or, above all, for making sense of its
results]{.underline}**. His method derives from the work of fashionable
French intellectuals and theorists. Existentialists, structuralists,
deconstructionists, and postmodernists all postulate grandiose theories,
but, unfortunately, **[these are based on flimsy historical or empirical
foundations]{.underline}**. Claude Levi-Strauss, with just a few years
of field work in Brazil, constructed a grand theory about the structures
of the human mind. As Edmund Leach put it in his short monograph on
Levi-Strauss, the French anthropologist never bothered to learn the
native languages, never spent more than a few weeks in one place; the
subsequent model, peppered with Marxist jargon, that he concocted on
such meager empirical foundations is \"little more than an amalgam\" of
his \"own prejudiced presuppositions.\" Leach continues, \"Levi-Strauss
\... is insufficiently critical of his source material. He always seems
to be able to find just what he is looking for. Any evidence, however
dubious, is acceptable so long as it fits with logically calculated
expectations; but wherever the data run counter to the theory
Levi-Strauss will either bypass the evidence or marshal the full
resources of his powerful invective to have the heresy thrown out of
court\.... \[H\]e consistently behaves like an advocate defending a
cause rather than a scientist searching for ultimate truth.\"\' This
tradition was carried on by Michel Foucault, surely one of the great
charlatans of modern times. **[Said]{.underline}**, influenced by
Foucault, Marx, and the French intellectual tradition, **[refuses to
acknowledge evidence that does not fit into his already prepared
Procrustean bed; evidence such as the work
of]{.underline}** German **[Orientalists]{.underline}** or the evidence
of Indian Orientalists **[who praise the scholarly contribution of their
European colleagues]{.underline}**. Generally speaking, **[Said\'s
thinking can be characterized as \"ideological.\"]{.underline}** An
ideologue is immune to argument; **[he believes his ideas about man,
history, and society to be self-evident, and anyone opposing them to be
either stupid or malevolent. He cannot lose since his interpretation has
already been determined in advance of observations. His attitude is
immune to facts or reality]{.underline}**, and no argument will ever
disprove him.\' **[The ideology is a way of interpreting the world: I
can shut out recalcitrant data, I can shut my eyes if
necessary]{.underline}**.\' **[Ideology is a method of substituting
sweeping structural explanations for empirical
investigation]{.underline}**; for the ideologues, **[all the failings of
his target group are the systematic products of its core
identity.]{.underline}** In cultures already immune to self-criticism,
Said helped Muslims, and particularly Arabs, perfect their already
well-developed sense of self-pity. **[There is a kind of comfort and
absolution in being told that none of your problems are of your making,
that you do not have to accept any responsibility for the ills besetting
your society.]{.underline}** **[It is all the fault of the
West,]{.underline}** of infidels. **[There is no need even to take
responsibility for selfdetermination]{.underline}**, it is easier to
accept money from the Western donors and to treat it as one\'s rightful
due from them, that is, a kind of jizyah. **[The attraction of Said\'s
thesis for third-world intellectuals is thus easily understandable. But
why was it so successful among Western intellectuals? Post-World War II
Western intellectuals and leftists were consumed by guilt for the
West\'s colonial past and continuing colonialist present,
and]{.underline}** they wholeheartedly **[embraced
any]{.underline}**theory or **[ideology that voiced]{.underline}** or at
least seemed to voice **[the putatively thwarted aspirations of the
peoples of the third world]{.underline}**. **[Orientalism came at the
precise time when anti-Western rhetoric was at its most shrill and was
already being taught at Western universities]{.underline}**, and when
third-worldism was at its most popular. **[Jean-Paul Sartre
preached]{.underline}** that all white men were complicit in the
exploitation of the third world, and **[that violence against Westerners
was a legitimate means for colonized men to re-acquire their
manhood]{.underline}**., **[Said]{.underline}** **[went further: \"It is
therefore correct that every European, in what he could say about the
Orient, was consequently a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally
ethnocentric]{.underline}**\" (p. 204). **[Not only, for Said, is every
European a racist, but he must necessarily be so]{.underline}**. As I
have argued, Western civilization has been more willing to criticize
itself than any other major culture. **[These self-administered
admonishments are a far cry from Said\'s savage strictures, and yet they
found a new generation ready to take them to
heart]{.underline}**. **[Berating and blaming the West]{.underline}**, a
fashionable game in the 1960s and 1970s that impressionable youth took
seriously**[, had the results we now see when the same generation
appears unwilling to defend the West against the greatest threat that it
has faced since the Nazis.]{.underline}** **[When shown that Said is
indeed a fraud, his friends and supporters in academia sidestep the
criticisms and evidence]{.underline}**, and pretend, as did several
reviewers of Robert Irwin\'s book on Said, **[that Said may indeed have
got the \"footling details\" wrong but he was, nonetheless, onto a
higher truth]{.underline}**. **[Said\'s
influence,]{.underline}** thus, **[was a result of a conjunction of
several intellectual and political trends:]{.underline}** post-French
Algeria and post-Vietnam tiers mondisme (third-worldism); the
politicization of increasingly postmodernist English departments that
had argued away the very idea of truth, objective truth; and the
influence of Foucault. In effect **[Said played on each of these
confidence tricks to create a master fraud that bound American academics
and Middle East tyrants in unstated bonds of anti American
complicity\']{.underline}** **[In Said\'s works there is no room for
historical comparisons]{.underline}**. **[The West alone
stands]{.underline}**, tried on the basis of a few examples taken out of
historical context, **[judged and condemned as the source of all
evil]{.underline}**. There was slavery in the West, but, as pointed out
above, the West itself took the first steps to actually abolish it.
Indeed, abolitionism, as Olivier Petre-Grenouilleau reminds us in his
pathbreaking comparative study,\' was an Occidental concept that did not
resonate in either black Africa or the Islamic world. In his study of
the slave trade in the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century, Ehud
R. **[Toledano]{.underline}** wrote, \"Accepted by custom, perpetuated
by tradition and sanctioned by religion, slavery was an integral part of
Ottoman society.\" He further **[adds that no abolitionist movement ever
emerged in the Ottoman Empire]{.underline}**. On the
contrary, **[Ottoman politics can be characterized as a continual
resistance of varying intensity to British abolitionist
pressure]{.underline}**. Slavery was taken for granted and abolitionism
was considered a foreign, English idea-barely understood, let alone
accepted.\' Turkish historian Y H. **[Erdem confirms Toledano\'s
findings]{.underline}**; there was no organized abolitionist movement in
the Ottoman Empire**[, no abolitionist tracts popularizing the subject
and bringing home the suffering of the slaves.]{.underline}**Moreover,
in modern Turkey, continues Erdem, th**[e abolition of slavery is not a
part of the educational curriculum, and there is no specific date for
abolition that could have been used as a point of departure for such a
study]{.underline}**.9

#### The alternative's rejection of Orientalist discourse prevents ongoing capitalist reinvigoration of Orientalism.

**Vukovich 12** (professor of critical and cultural theory as well as
postcolonial and China studies at Hong Kong University, Daniel, "China
and Orientalism: Western Knowledge Production and the PRC," pg. 150,
2012)//

But as noted above[, Marx wisely insists on raising the question of
other "historically determined modes of production"; thinking this way
can arrest the reifying powers of socially "objective" categories of
thought.]{.underline} I have suggested that [we can expand the "mode"
concept to include social space and productive
activity]{.underline};37 [this is further warranted by the expansion of
capitalism]{.underline} (and knowl- edge production) itself [since
Marx]{.underline}'s time, [including the commodification of
discourse.]{.underline} This brings us to the question of China in
space, so to speak. Let us begin with a perennial but still-useful truth
from classical Sinology: the thing about **[China is]{.underline}** that
it is very big and very old. Which is a way of saying that it is
an **[exceptionally dense and diverse]{.underline}** space. **[Much of
it is no doubt]{.underline}** **[capitalist space, including most
obviously its economy]{.underline}** (much of it), its urban centers,
and the results and artifacts of its epochal growth, from art house
cinema to liberal intel- lectual discourse and consumerism. These are
the sites of most China--Western exchanges and flows, overwhelmingly the
urban centers and the rich, southern and coastal belts of the land. This
is the social, global space that is represented by the "China" that
experts and observers travel to and produce knowledge about. It should
not be controversial to describe this as specifically
capitalist. **[Within such contexts and spaces, then,
Sinological-orientalism functions as a "socially valid, therefore
objective" form of thought.]{.underline}** Its detail, applicability,
explanatory and "objective" powers (such as they may be) in some sense
derive from these places. They are not pure fantasy or only false
consciousness. **[These qualities and the discourse/knowledge itself are
a result of the encounter there between Chinese and Western/postcolonial
spaces, discourse, and realities. It can still be unpacked through
critical analysis.]{.underline}** But of course the above are not the
contexts and social spaces of all of modern Chinese history (let alone
the longue durée), nor of the Mao or revolu- tionary era. There are
other histories, temporalities, social imaginaries, discourses, and
spaces at work. (China is not fully capitalist to the degree that the
U.S. or UK or Hong Kong are.) Understanding this helps one see
the [discursive violence of Sinological-orientalism vis-à-vis China's
past as well as the places and people that have not benefited from the
"era of reform and opening up."]{.underline} Even within one urban
center -- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, any- where -- there
are layers of social space and history at work, counter-factuals and
differences that resist, contradict, or escape normative
Sino-orientalist codings. To take an obvious but symbolically
significant example from southern Henan: Nanjiecun, the neo-Maoist,
collectivized village of 12,000 people that is a site of red tourism, a
bane of liberal intellectuals, and an actually existing market-
socialist and re-distributive enterprise dating from the mid-1980s.38 I
am not speaking of local "color" or differences, or individual Chinese
self-understand- ings that are at odds with the orientalism I have
examined (though these are important). [When we follow Marx's point that
thought categories are historical and economic we can better see the
non-capitalist and non- or differently global aspects of China. We can
discern systematic or otherwise abundant other-mes- sages about the
meanings, realities, and "signi cations" from within China and between
it and the rest of the world. ]{.underline}**These are not "in the true"
of China studies and the knowledge of China produced within Western, now
global intellectual-- political culture.**

#### Orientalism critiques are dogmatic -- turns all scholarship into truisms that only affirm self interests

For the last thirty years, [Edward W. Said's book "Orientalism" has
dominated]{.underline}---suffocated would be the less polite
word---scholarship on the Arab world. According to his devotees, [Said
"proved" that the West collectively and systemically fictionalized the
Arab world and the third world in general, in order to affirm its own
ostensibly superior identity and delegitimize and dehumanize the
"Orient."]{.underline} [He coined the term "Orientalism" to describe
this phenomenon]{.underline}. With the inception of the Arab Spring (or
whatever you want to call it), that term has returned to popular
language. Protesters around the Arab world have screamed kifaya
(enough!) to dictatorial rule and Orientalism's tyrannical influence on
scholarship and punditry deserves a similarly clamorous denunciation. As
a work of social science, [Said's followers interpret "Orientalism,"
with accidental irony and fragile evidence, as an argument that
systematically delegitimizes all prior and current Western
understandings]{.underline} of the Arab world. [As a critique of Western
historical scholarship on the nineteenth and early twentieth century,
Orientalism has elements of truth.]{.underline} [However, in the field
of social science, what became known as "Orientalism" simply replaced
Orientalism with---]{.underline}if you will allow
me[---Occidentalism.]{.underline} [In rebutting the formation of one
generalizing "other," Said set the ground for the production of a second
"other."]{.underline} Today, ["[Orientalism" is a crux for attacking any
opinion or presentation of facts that displays skepticism toward
anything]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arab world. An editorial on the
Huffington Post is emblematic of this ruse[: "A classical orientalist
construction would be equating Islam with terrorism...Rather than
acknowledge the heterogeneity of thought and behavior among
Muslims."]{.underline} Of course[, one can both acknowledge that
heterogeneity and attribute some piece of modern terrorism to
Islam.]{.underline} [But, like Orientalism itself, "Orientalism" creates
for its believers a fictional foe in order to affirm their own
identities. The authority of "Orientalism" in the social sciences, in
particular those related to Middle Eastern studies, is difficult, if not
impossible, to underestimate]{.underline}. Most studies on the modern
Middle East, and some in the social sciences in general, begin, and
often revolve around, the ideas made famous by Said. This influence
reaches far beyond the university gates and extends through media into
the very center of narratives on social justice, international
relations, and their intersection. Newspapers, assorted journals, and
seemingly every editorial on Al-Jazeera all indicate that Said is more
or less the Paul R. Krugman of Middle Eastern studies---you don't have
to agree with him, but you do have to read him. Fortunately, the impetus
for removing Said's Occidentalism from the heart of Middle Eastern
studies can actually be found within Said's work itself. [Said's
"Orientalism" represents an idealistic rejection of greed and wealth as
motivating factors in intellectual pursuit. In "Orientalism" and other
works, he chronicled how European artists, scholars, and intellectuals
of the nineteenth and early twentieth century created a reality that
served their countries' imperial interests.]{.underline} Excusing for a
moment the thickness of the brush Said paints with to prove his point,
any thinker should concur [with Said on the dangers of a marriage
between academia and moneyed interests. But the pernicious proliferation
of Said's theory demonstrates that academia's inertia and magnitude can
be as influential and debilitative as colonial interests. Ideas follow
not only the interests of money, but also the internal interests of
scholars who thrive in academia by gratifying and expanding its existing
assumptions and theories]{.underline}. As is often the case in the
softest of sciences**[, [when the theory of Orientalism entered the
ivory tower]{.mark} to rabid applause and hastily unfurled red carpets,
[it quickly transmogrified into dogma.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[When
an idea is accepted as a truism, it]{.mark} quickly [becomes a platitude
that every generation of scholars passes on to the next as a piece of
collective identity.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Academia may be where great
ideas originate, but it is also where bad ideas live far beyond their
use or truth.]{.underline} **[[We should reject "Orientalism"]{.mark}
for the same reason Said rejected Orientalism---[it is a false reality
sustained only by self-affirming interests. Like all non-scientific
dogma, "Orientalism" is a truth within itself without
truth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I do not intend to make Said's mistake**[;
I [recognize that "academia" is not monolithic and that no system of
thought can be truly all encompassing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of course,
scholars produced and continue to produce critiques of "Orientalism,"
but, in general, those critiques are undermined while Said's theory
remains relatively unchallenged in comparison. Nor do I intend to imply
that stereotypes about Muslims and Arabs are not horribly reprehensible,
but they are not unique, either[. All cultures identify themselves by
collectively dehumanizing others, but Orientalism, the theory, does that
far more frequently than any vestigial clusters of Orientalism
itself.]{.underline} **[[One valuable conclusion of Orientalism is that
any social theory should be met with fierce skepticism in both its
substance and its sources.]{.mark} Said's acolytes would do well to
remember that.]{.underline}**

#### Policy making is uniquely key to the alt -- influencing policy and enables real world change

**[While the concept of orientalism propounded by Edward
Said,]{.underline}** the influential Columbia professor who died in
2003, **[has inspired constructive debate, it may have inhibited
scholarship in cultural studies and other areas that are useful to
policymakers]{.underline}**. However, **[Said\'s ideas may also offer
promising new avenues for U.S. foreign policy and public
diplomacy.]{.underline}** By successfully depicting all existing
approaches to studying Middle Eastern and other non-Western societies as
premised on \"orientalism,\" Said forced scholars to be more cautious
and rigorous in how they analyzed and understood these groups. This
approach has profoundly changed the way Western states deal with the
non-Western world. The last three decades have revolutionized the
Western view of other peoples. Until the 1960s, scholars
unselfconsciously described Middle Eastern societies as \"oriental,\" an
appellation with a variety of implications. This view is now untenable.
However, [the demise of this perspective has had important effects on
the U.S. policymaking process. The orientalist view drove policy and
diplomacy for much of the last century. It sat comfortably with the
colonialist assumptions that Western societies struggled to reassert
after World War II.]{.underline} However, [this perspective eventually
collapsed as peoples rebelled against and overthrew colonial
powers.]{.underline} Despite repeatedly condemning colonialism, the
United States frequently suffered the \"colonialist\" label. In the
struggle against the Communist bloc, for instance, Washington\'s
leadership did little to dilute this characterization by the left. The
idea of the Western world as a pool of prejudice about \"oriental
peoples\" and their countries exploded in 1978 with the publication of
Said\'s Orientalism: \--Scholarly Impact. The book offered a searing
critique of Western scholarly views of the Arab world. It also struck a
fatal blow to \"oriental studies.\" \--Post-Colonial Studies. Said\'s
analysis had an enormous influence on scholarly research and public
debate. He argued that the conceptions of Middle Eastern and North
African societies developed in oriental studies presaged and assisted
colonial conquest. This spawned the idea of \"post-colonial\" studies.
\--Widespread Acceptance. Said\'s analysis was largely apposite. He
captured the persistence of colonial attitudes and prejudices among
Western elite views. Although his argument suffered serious critical
assaults, the core idea remains essential. \--Policy Influence.
Anthropologists, in particular, stung by the accusation that their
profession was a handmaiden of colonial institutions, have broadly
accepted Said\'s critique. Therefore, professional anthropologists have
largely resisted acting as expert advisers to governments. There are two
current arguments concerning the effect of Said\'s ideas on the Iraq
war: \--The relative absence of Arabic-speaking scholars among the U.S.
administrative elite seemed, to some critics, continuing evidence of
unrequited orientalist mindsets. \--A less controversial argument posits
that Said\'s influence may have contributed to cutbacks in area studies
programs in many Western universities. This may have abetted
Washington\'s failure to understand Iraqi society. Western states must
confront the challenge of better understanding non-Western societies,
while avoiding charges of paternalistic orientalism and \"imperialism.\"
Certainly, the latter charge is inaccurate. However, erasing
colonial-era influences requires an inter-generational change in
attitudes. [Much is being done to alleviate these feelings through
exchange programs. Said\'s critique exposed the limits of Western
societies\' understanding of the end of colonialism. Many societies
continue to feel ignored or denigrated by the West, which feeds
deep-seated negative attitudes toward the United States.]{.underline}
This suggests remedial policy and public diplomacy measures: \--Hazards
Of \'Democracy-Building.\' Non-Western states cannot be treated as
apparent appendages of their former colonial masters without generating
resentment. \--Toned-Down Rhetoric. Overwrought language concerning a
\"clash of civilizations\" should be abandoned. \--Reconciling \'Core
Values.\' Washington could address how Western and non-Western societies
best discuss such complex concepts as \"evil\" and \"good.\" \--\'War On
Terror\' Approaches. Western and non-Western societies both must invest
in the necessary language and country studies to improve cross-cultural
understanding. The forces driving divisions between Western states and
states in which non-Western values are dominant derive in part from
enduring legacies of the colonial era. **[Acknowledging this context,
and accounting for it in the policymaking process, could help alleviate
deep-seated resentment of the West in certain societies.]{.underline}**
