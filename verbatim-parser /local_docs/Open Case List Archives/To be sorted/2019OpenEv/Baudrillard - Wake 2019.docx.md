"Smile and others will smile back. Smile to show how transparent, how
candid you are. Smile if you have nothing to say. Most of all, do not
hide the fact you have nothing to say nor your total indifference to
others. Let this emptiness, this profound indifference shine out
spontaneously in your smile." \

"The futility of everything that comes to us from the media is the
inescapable consequence of the absolute inability of that particular
stage to remain silent. Music, commercial breaks, news flashes, adverts,
news broadcasts, movies, presenters---there is no alternative but to
fill the screen; otherwise there would be an irremediable void\....
That's why the slightest technical hitch, the slightest slip on the part
of the presenter becomes so exciting, for it reveals the depth of the
emptiness squinting out at us through this little window." \

"...sense of futility that comes from doing anything merely to prove to
yourself that you can do it: having a child, climbing a mountain, making
some sexual conquest, committing suicide.\
The marathon is a form of demonstrative suicide, suicide as advertising:
it is running to show you are capable of getting every last drop of
energy out of yourself, to prove it... to prove what? That you are
capable of finishing. Graffiti carry the same message. They simply say:
I'm so-and-so and I exist! They are free publicity for existence.\
Do we continually have to prove to ourselves that we exist? A strange
sign of weakness, harbinger of a new fanaticism for a faceless
performance, endlessly self-evident." \

"Whence the possibility of an ideological analysis of Disneyland (L.
Marin did it very well in Utopiques, jeux d\'espace \[Utopias, play of
space\]): digest of the American way of life, panegyric of American
values, idealized transposition of a contradictory reality. Certainly.
But this masks something else and this \"ideological\" blanket functions
as a cover for a simulation of the third order: Disneyland exists in
order to hide that it is the \"real\" country, all of \"real\" America
that is Disneyland (a bit like prisons are there to hide that it is the
social in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, that is carceral).
Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that
the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that
surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and
to the order of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false
representation of reality (ideology) but of concealing the fact that the
real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle." \

"Human rights, dissidence, antiracism, SOS-this, SOS-that: these are
soft, easy, post coitum historicum ideologies, \'after-the-orgy\'
ideologies for an easy-going generation which has known neither hard
ideologies nor radical philosophies. The ideology of a generation which
is neo-sentimental in its politics too, which has rediscovered altruism,
conviviality, international charity and the individual bleeding heart.
Emotional outpourings, solidarity, cosmopolitan emotiveness, multi-media
pathos: all soft values harshly condemned by the Nietzschean,
Marxo-Freudian age\... A new generation, that of the spoilt children of
the crisis, whereas the preceding one was that of the accursed children
of history." \

"Travel was once a means of being elsewhere, or of being nowhere. Today
it is the only way we have of feeling that we are somewhere. At home,
surrounded by information, by screens, I am no longer anywhere, but
rather everywhere in the world at once, in the midst of a universal
banality - a banality that is the same in every country. To arrive in a
new city, or in a new language, is suddenly to find oneself here and
nowhere else. The body rediscovers how to look. Delivered from images,
it rediscovers the imagination." \

strangeness of the desert and of the simulacrum, with all the veracity

that *the death of capital* has made of us---because the desert of
cities is equal to the desert of sand---the jungle of signs is equal to
that of the forests---the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of
nature---only the vertiginous seduction of a dying system remains, in
which work buries work, in which value buries value---leaving a virgin,
sacred space without pathways, continuous as Bataille wished it, where

"And so art is everywhere, since artifice is at the very heart of
reality. And so art is dead, not only because its critical transcendence
is gone, but because reality itself, entirely impregnated by an
aesthetic which is inseparable from its own structure, has been confused
with its own image. Reality no longer has the time to take on the
appearance of reality. It no longer even surpasses fiction: it captures
every dream even before it takes on the appearance of a dream." \

"This false distance is present everywhere: in spy films, in Godard, in
modern advertising, which uses it continually as a cultural allusion. It
is not really clear in the end whether this \'cool\' smile is the smile
of humour or that of commercial complicity. This is also the case with
pop, and its smile ultimately encapsulates all its ambiguity: it is not
the smile of critical distance, but the smile of collusion" \

"But what becomes of the divinity when it reveals itself in icons, when
it is simply incarnated in images as a visible theology? Or does it
volatilize itself in the simulacra that, alone, deploy their power and
pomp of fascination - the visible machinery of icons substituted for the
pure and intelligible Idea of God? This is precisely what was feared by
Iconoclasts, whose millennial quarrel is still with us today. This is
precisely because they predicted this omnipotence of simulacra, the
faculty simulacra have of effacing God from the conscience of man, and
the destructive, annihilating truth that they allow to appear - that
deep down God never existed, even God himself was never anything but his
own simulacra - from this came their urge to destroy the images. If they
could have believed that these images only obfuscated or masked the
Platonic Idea of God, there would have been no reason to destroy them.
One can live with the idea of distorted truth. But their metaphysical
despair came from the idea that the image didn\'t conceal anything at
all." \

"This country is without hope. Even its garbage is clean, its trade
lubricated, its traffic pacified. The latent, the lacteal, the lethal -
life is so liquid, the signs and messages are so liquid, the bodies and
the cars are so fluid, the hair so blond, and the soft technologies so
luxuriant, that a European dreams of death and murder, of suicide
motels, of orgies and cannibalism to counteract the perfection of the
ocean, of the light, of that insane ease of life, to counteract the
hyperreality of everything here." \

"Today\...no performance can be without its control screen video\...its
goal is to be hooked up to itself\...the mirror phase has given way to
the video phase. What develops around the video or stereo culture is not
a narcissistic imaginary, but an effect of frantic self-referentiality,
a short-circuit which immediately hooks up like with like, and, in doing
so, emphasizes their surface intensity and deeper meaninglessness." \

"We criticize Americans for not being able either to analyse or
conceptualize. But this is a wrong-headed critique. It is we who imagine
that everything culminates in transcendence, and that nothing exists
which has not been conceptualized. Not only do they care little for such
a view, but their perspective is the very opposite: it is not
conceptualizing reality, but realizing concepts and materializing ideas,
that interests them. The ideas of the religion and enlightened morality
of the eighteenth century certainly, but also dreams, scientific values,
and sexual perversions. Materializing freedom, but also the unconscious.
Our phantasies around space and fiction, but also our phantasies of
sincerity and virtue, or our mad dreams of technicity. Everything that
has been dreamt on this side of the Atlantic has a chance of being
realized on the other. They build the real out of ideas. We transform
the real into ideas, or into ideology." \

"Virtuality is different from the spectacle, which still left room for a
critical consciousness and demystification. The abstraction of the
\'spectacle\' was never irrevocable, even for the Situationists. Whereas
unconditional realization is irrevocable, since we are no longer either
alienated or dispossessed: we are in possession of all the information.
We are no longer spectators, but actors in the performance, and actors
increasingly integrated into the course of that performance. Whereas we
could face up to the unreality of the world as spectacle, we are
defenceless before the extreme reality of this world, before this
virtual perfection. We are, in fact, beyond all disalienation. This is
the new form of terror, by comparison with which the horrors of
alienation were very small beer." \

"By crossing into a space whose curvature is no longer that of the real,
nor that of truth, the era of simulation is inaugurated by a liquidation
of all referentials - worse: with their artificial resurrection in the
systems of signs, a material more malleable than meaning, in that it
lends itself to all systems of equivalences, to all binary oppositions,
to all combinatory algebra. It is no longer a question of imitation, nor
duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs
of the real for the real, that is to say of an operation of deterring
every real process via its operational double, a programmatic,
metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all the signs of
the real and shortcircuits all its vicissitudes." \

"Each category is generalized to the greatest possible extent, so that
it eventually loses all specificity and is reabsorbed by all the other
categories. When everything is political, nothing is political anymore,
the word itself is meaningless. When everything is sexual, nothing is
sexual any more, and sex loses its determinants. When everything is
aesthetic, nothing is beautiful or ugly any more, and art itself
disappears." \

"The whole gestural system of work was also obscene, in sharp contrast
to the miniaturized and abstract gestural system of control to which it
has now been reduced. The world of the objects of old seems like a
theatre of cruelty and instinctual drives in comparison with the formal
neutrality and prophylactic \'whiteness\' of our perfect functional
objects. Thus the handle of the flatiron gradually diminishes as it
undergoes \'contouring\' - the term is typical in its superficiality and
abstractness; increasingly it suggests the very absence of gesture, and
carried to its logical extreme this handle will no longer be manual -
merely manipulable. At that point, *the perfecting of the form will have
relegated man to a pure contemplation of his power*. " \

"Silence is banished from our screens; it has no place in communication.
Media images (and media texts resemble media images in every way) never
fall silent: images and messages must follow one upon the other without
interruption. But silence is exactly that - a blip in the circuitry,
that minor catastrophe, that slip which, on television for instance,
becomes\
highly meaningful - a break laden now with anxiety, now with jubilation,
which confirms the fact that all this communication is basically nothing
but a rigid script, an uninterrupted fiction designed to free us not
only from the void of the television screen but equally from the void of
our own mental screen, whose images we wait on with the same
fascination." \

"The disaffection, neurosis, anguish and frustration encountered by
psychoanalysis comes no doubt from being unable to love or to be loved,
from being unable to give or take pleasure, but the radical
disenchatment comes from seduction and its failure. Only those who lie
completely outside seduction are ill, even if they remain fully capable
of loving and making love. Psychoanalysis believes it treats the
disorder of sex and desire, but in reality it is dealing with the
disorders of seduction\... The most serious deficiences always concern
charm and not pleasure, enchantment and not some vital or sexual
satisfaction." \

"Even the Middle Ages, which condemned and punished animals in due form,
was in this way much closer to them than we are. They held them to be
guilty: which was a way of honoring them. We take them for nothing, and
it is on this basis that we are \"human\" with them." \

"But it must be seen that the term \'catastrophe\' has this
\'catastrophic\' meaning of the end and annihilation only in a linear
vision of accumulation and productive finality that the system imposes
on us. Etymologically, the term only signifies the curvature, the
winding down to the bottom of a cycle leading to what can be called the
\'horizon of the event,\' to the horizon of meaning, beyond which we
cannot go. Beyond it, nothing takes place *that has meaning for us* -
but it suffices to exceed this ultimatum of meaning in order that
catastrophe itself no longer appear as the last, nihilistic day of
reckoning, such as it functions in our current collective fantasy." \

"What we seek in travel is neither discovery nor trade but rather a
gentle deterritorialization: we want to be taken over by the journey -
in other words, by absence. As our metal vectors transcend meridians,
oceans and poles, absence takes on a fleshy quality. The clandestineness
of the depths of private life gives way to annihilation by longitude and
latitude. But in the end the body tires of not knowing where it is, even
if the mind finds this absence exalting, as if it were a quality proper
to itself.\
\
Perhaps, after all, what we seek in others is the same gentle
deterritorialization that we seek in travel. Instead of one\'s own
desire, instead of discovery, we are tempted by exile in the desire of
the other, or by the desire of the other as an ocean to cross. The looks
and gestures of lovers already have the distance of exile about them;
the language of lovers is an expatriation in words that are afraid to
signify; and the bodies of lovers are a tender hologram to eye and hand,
offering no resistance and hence susceptible of being crisscrossed, like
airspace, by desire. We move around with circumspection on a mental
planet of circumvolutions, and from our excesses and passions we bring
back the same transparent memories as we do from our travels." \

have disappeared. But we also had objects not to believe in, which is

reasonably well. These, too, have disappeared. And we survive only by a

absorbing everything put about under the heading of news or information,

"At the fourth, the fractal (or viral, or radiant) stage of value, there
is no point of reference at all, and value radiates in all directions,
occupying all interstices, without reference to anything whatsoever, by
virtue of pure contiguity. At the fractal stage there is no longer any
equivalence, whether natural or general. Properly speaking there is now
no law of value, merely a sort of epidemic of value, a sort of general
metastasis of value, a haphazard proliferation and dispersal of value.
Indeed, we should really no longer speak of \'value\' at all, for this
kind of propagation or chain reaction makes all valuation possible." \

"We find the same situation in the economy. On the one hand, the
battered remnants of production and the real economy; on the other, the
circulation of gigantic amounts of virtual capital. But the two are so
disconnected that the misfortunes which beset that capital -- stock
market crashes and other financial debacles -- do not bring about the
collapse of real economies any more. It is the same in the political
sphere: scandals, corruption and the general decline in standards have
no decisive effects in a split society, where responsibility (the
possibility that the two parties may respond to each other) is no longer
part of the game.\
This paradoxical situation is in a sense beneficial: it protects civil
society (what remains of it) from the vicissitudes of the political
sphere, just as it protects the economy (what remains of it) from the
random fluctuations of the Stock Exchange and international finance. The
immunity of the one creates a reciprocal immunity in the other -- a
mirror indifference. Better: real society is losing interest in the
political class, while nonetheless availing itself of the spectacle. At
last, then, the media have some use, and the 'society of the spectacle'
assumes its full meaning in this fierce irony: the masses availing
themselves of the spectacle of the dysfunctionings of representation
through the random twists in the story of the political class's
corruption. All that remains now to the politicians is the obligation to
sacrifice themselves to provide the requisite spectacle for the
entertainment of the people." \

"The information superhighways will have the same effect as our present
superhighways or motorways. They will cancel out the landscape, lay
waste to the territory and abolish real distances. What is merely
physical and geographical in the case of our motorways will assume its
full dimensions in the electronic field with the abolition of mental
distances and the absolute shrinkage of time. All short circuits (and
the establishment of this planetary hyper-space is tantamount to one
immense short circuit) produce electric shocks. What we see emerging
here is no longer merely territorial desert, but social desert,
employment desert, the body itself being laid waste by the very
concentration of information. A kind of Big Crunch, contemporaneous with
the Big Bang of the financial markets and the information networks. We
are merely at the dawning of the process, but the waste and the
wastelands are already growing much faster than the computerization
process itself." \

"The clones are already there; the virtual beings are already there. We
are all replicants! We are so in the sense that, as in Blade Runner, it
is already almost impossible to distinguish properly human behaviour
from its projection on the screen, from its double in the image and its
computerized prostheses." \

"The strategy of power has long seemed founded on the apathy of the
masses. The more passive they were, the more secure it was. But this
logic is only characteristic of the bureaucratic and centralist phase of
power. And it is this which today turns against it: the inertia it has
fostered becomes the sign of its death." \

"Hyperreality and simulation are deterrents of every principle and every
objective, they\
turn against power the deterrent that it used so well for such a long
time. Because in the\
end, throughout its history it was capital that first fed on the
destructuration of every\
referential, of every human objective, that shattered every ideal
distinction between true\
and false, good and evil, in order to establish a radical law of
equivalence and exchange,\
the iron law of its power. Capital was the first to play at deterrence,
abstraction,\
disconnection, deterritorialization, etc., and if it is the one that
fostered reality, the reality\
principle, it was also the first to liquidate it by exterminating all
use value, all real\
equivalence of production and wealth, in the very sense we have of the
unreality of the\
stakes and the omnipotence of manipulation. Well, today it is this same
logic that is even\
more set against capital. And as soon as it wishes to combat this
disastrous spiral by\
secreting a last glimmer of reality, on which to establish a last
glimmer of power, it does\
nothing but multiply the signs and accelerate the play of simulation." \

"Finally, the medium is the message not only signifies the end of the
message, but also the end of the medium. There are no more media in the
literal sense of the word (I\'m speaking particularly of electronic mass
media) - that is, of a mediating power between one reality and another,
between one state of the real and another. Neither in content, nor in
form. Strictly, this is what implosion signifies. The absorption of one
pole into another, the short-circuiting between poles of every
differential system of meaning, the erasure of distinct terms and
oppositions, including that of the medium and of the real - thus the
impossibility of any mediation, of any dialectical intervention between
the two or from one to the other. Circularity of all media effects.
Hence the impossibility of meaning in the literal sense of a unilateral
vector that goes from one pole to another. One must envisage this
critical but original situation at its very limit: it is the only one
left us. It is useless to dream of revolution through content, useless
to dream of a revelation through form, because the medium and the real
are now in a single nebula whose truth is indecipherable." \

"One can live with the idea of distorted truth. But their metaphysical
despair came from the idea that the image didn\'t conceal anything at
all, and that these images were in essence not images, such as an
original model would have made them, but perfect simulacra, forever
radiant with their \
own fascination. Thus this death of the divine referential must be
exorcised at all costs. One can see that the iconoclasts, whom one
accuses of disdaining and negating images, were those who accorded them
their true value, in contrast to the iconolaters who only saw
reflections in them and were content to venerate a filigree God." \

"LIVE OR DIE\': the graffiti message on the pier at Santa Monica is
mysterious, because we really have no choice between life and death. If
you live, you live, if you die, you die. It is like saying \'be
yourself, or don\'t be!\' It is stupid, and yet it is enigmatic. You
could read it to mean that you should live intensely or else disappear,
but that is banal. Following the model of \'payor die!\', \'your money
or your life!\', it would become \' your life or your life!\'. Stupid,
again, since you cannot exchange life for itself. And yet there is
poetic force in this implacable tautology, as there always is when there
is nothing to be understood. In the end, the lesson of this graffiti is
perhaps: \'if you get more stupid than me, you die!" \

"As massas conservaram dele somente a imagem, nunca a Idéia. Elas jamais
foram atingidas pela Idéia de Deus, que permaneceu um assunto de padres,
nem pelas angústias do pecado e da salvação pessoal. O que elas
conservaram foi o fascínio dos mártires e dos santos, do juízo final, da
dança dos mortos, foi o sortilégio, foi o espetáculo e o cerimonial da
Igreja, a imanência do ritual - contra a transcendência da Idéia. Foram
pagãs e permaneceram pagãs à sua maneira, jamais freqüentadas pela
Instância Suprema, mas vivendo das miudezas das imagens, da superstição
e do diabo. Práticas degradadas em relação ao compromisso espiritual da
fé? Pode ser. Esta é a sua maneira, através da banalidade dos rituais e
dos simulacros profanos, de minar o imperativo categórico da moral e da
fé, o imperativo sublime do sentido, que elas repeliram. Não porque não
pudessem alcançar as luzes sublimes da religião: elas as ignoraram. Não
recusam morrer por uma fé, por uma causa, por um ídolo. O que elas
recusam é a transcendência, é a interdição, a diferença, a espera, a
ascese, que produzem o sublime triunfo da religião. Para as massas, o
Reino de Deus sempre esteve sobre a terra, na imanência pagã das
imagens, no espetáculo que a Igreja lhes oferecia. Desvio fantástico do
princípio religioso. As massas absorveram a religião na prática
sortílega e espetacular que adotaram." \

"You have to try everything, for consumerist man is haunted by the fear
of \'missing\' something, some form of enjoyment or other. You never
know whether a particular encounter, a particular experience (Christmas
in the Canaries, eel in whisky, the Prado, LSD, Japanese-style
love-making) will not elicit some \'sensation\'. It is no longer desire,
or even \'taste\', or a specific inclination that are at stake, but a
generalized curiosity, driven by a vague sense of unease - it is the
\'fun morality\' or the imperative to enjoy oneself, to exploit to the
full one\'s potential for thrills pleasure or gratification." \

"This omnipresent cult of the body is extraordinary. It is the only
object on which everyone is made to concentrate, not as a source of
pleasure, but as an object of frantic concern, in the obsessive fear of
failure or substandard performance, a sign and an anticipation of death,
that death to which no one can any longer give a meaning, but which
everyone knows has at all times to be prevented. The body is cherished
in the perverse certainty of its uselessness, in the total certainty of
its non-resurrection. Now, pleasure is an effect of the resurrection of
the body, by which it exceeds that hormonal, vascular and dietetic
equilibrium in which we seek to imprison it, that exorcism by fitness
and hygiene. So the body has to be made to forget pleasure as present
grace, to forget its possible metamorphosis into other forms of
appearance and become dedicated to the utopian preservation of a youth
that is, in any case, already lost. For the body which doubts its own
existence is already half-dead, and the current semi-yogic,
semi-ecstatic cult of the body is a morbid preoccupation. The care taken
of the body while it is alive prefigures the way it will be made up in
the funeral home." \

"Nothing resembles itself, and holographic reproduction, like all
fantasies of the exact synthesis or resurrection of the real (this also
goes for scientific experimentation), is already no longer real, is
already hyperreal. It thus never has reproductive (truth) value, but
always already simulation value . . . Singular and murderous power of
the potentialization of the truth, of the potentialization of the real.
This is perhaps why twins were deified, and sacrificed, in a more savage
culture: hypersimilitude was equivalent to the murder of the original,
and thus to a pure non-meaning. Any classification or signification, any
modality of meaning can thus be destroyed simply by logically being
elevated to the nth power - pushed to its limit, it is as if all truth
swallowed its own criteria of truth as one \"swallows one\'s birth
certificate\" and lost all its meaning. Thus the weight of the world, or
the universe, can eventually be calculated in exact terms, but initially
it appears absurd, because it no longer has a reference, or a mirror in
which it can come to be reflected - this totalization, which is
practically equivalent to that of all the dimensions of the real in its
hyperreal double, or to that of all the information on an individual in
his genetic double (clone), renders it immediately pataphysical." \

"There is no real reason why Disney should not buy up the human genome,
which is currently being sequenced, to turn it into a genetic
attraction. Why not cryogenize the whole planet, exactly as Walt Disney
had himself cryogenized in liquid nitrogen, with a view to some kind of
resurrection or other in the real world? But there no longer is a real
world, and there won't be one -- not even for Walt Disney: if he wakes
up one day he'll get the shock of his life. In the meantime, from the
depths of his liquid nitrogen he goes on annexing the world -- both
imaginary and real -- subsuming it into the spectral universe of virtual
reality in which we have all become extras. The difference is that, as
we slip on our data suits or our sensors, or tap away at our keyboards,
we are moving into living spectrality, whereas he, the brilliant
precursor, has moved into the virtual reality of death." \

"Bu konuda Ballard'ın gelişim çizgisi belki daha inandırıcı bir örnek
oluşturacaktır. Yazmış olduğu aşırı "fantazmagorik", bir düşü andıran,
ilk şaşırtıcı ve şiirsel öykülerinden biri olan ve artık bir bilimkurgu
öyküsü olarak nitelendirilemeyecek ancak günümüzde (IGH ya da Beton

"Engizisyon cellâtlarının sorunu neydi? Onlar Kötülüğün, Kötülük
İlkesinin itiraf edilmesini istiyorlardı. Suçlulara kazara suç işlemiş
olduklarını, ilâhî düzenin bir parçası olan Kötülük ilkesine istemeden
uymuş olduklarını söyletmek gerekiyordu. Böylelikle itiraf olayı insanı
rahatlatan bir nedenselliğin sürdürülmesini sağlarken; öte yandan
işkence, yani kötülüğün işkence yoluyla yok edilmesi "bir neden olarak
kötülük üretiminin" (bu ne sadistçe ne de bağışlatıcı türden bir
işkencedir) baş tâcı edilmesine neden oluyordu. Aksi takdirde imandan en
küçük sapma bile Tanrı'nın yarattığı her şeyden kuşku duyulmasına neden
olabilirdi. Laboratuarlarda ya da füzelerde hayvanlardan bilim adına
yine böylesine vahşi bir şekilde yararlanır, onları kötü emellerimize
alet edip elektrotlar ve ameliyat bıçaklarıyla tehdit ederken
kendilerine zorla itiraf ettirmeye çalıştığımız şey nedir?" \

"Power itself has for a long time produced nothing but the signs of its
resemblance. And at the same time, another figure of power comes into
play: that of a collective demand for *signs of power*---a holy union
that is reconstructed around its disappearance. The whole world adheres
to it more or less in terror of the collapse of the political. And in
the end the game of power becomes nothing but the *critical* obsession
with power---obsession with its death, obsession with its survival,
which increases as it disappears. When it has totally disappeared, we
will logically be under the total hallucination of power---a haunting
memory that is already in evidence everywhere, expressing at once the
compulsion to get rid of it (no one wants it anymore, everyone unloads
it on everyone else) and the panicked nostalgia over its loss. The
melancholy of societies without power: this has already stirred up
fascism, that overdose of a strong referential in a society that cannot
terminate its mourning." \

"You no longer watch TV, it is TV that watches you (live)," or again:
"You are no longer listening to Don't Panic, it is Don't Panic that is
listening to you"---a switch from the panoptic mechanism of surveillance
(*Discipline and Punish* \[Surveiller et punir\]) to a system of
deterrence, in which the distinction between the passive and the active
is abolished. There is no longer any imperative of submission to the
model, or to the gaze "YOU are the model!" "YOU are the majority!" Such
is the watershed of a hyperreal sociality, in which the real is confused
with the model, as in the statistical operation, or with the medium.
...Such is the last stage of the social relation, ours, which is no
longer one of persuasion (the classical age of propaganda, of ideology,
of publicity, etc.) but one of deterrence: "YOU are information, you are
the social, you are the event, you are involved, you have the word,
etc." An about-face through which it becomes impossible to locate one
instance of the model, of power, of the gaze, of the medium itself,
because you are always already on the other side." \

"All around \[the Centre Pompidou and Beauborg Museum\], the
neighborhood is nothing but a protective zone---remodeling,
disinfection, a snobbish and hygienic design---but above all in a
figurative sense: it is a machine for making emptiness. It is a bit like
the real danger nuclear power stations pose: not lack of security,
pollution, explosion, but a system of maximum security that radiates
around them, the protective zone of control and deterrence that extends,
slowly but surely, over the territory---a technical, ecological,
economic, geopolitical glacis. What does the nuclear matter? The station
is a matrix in which an absolute model of security is elaborated, which
will encompass the whole social field, and which is fundamentally a
model of deterrence (it is the same one that controls us globally, under
the sign of peaceful coexistence and of the simulation of atomic
danger).\
\
The same model, with the same proportions, is elaborated at the Center:
cultural fission, political deterrence." \

"Thus the media are producers not of socialization, but of exactly the
opposite, of the implosion of the social in the masses. And this is only
the macroscopic extension of the *implosion of meaning* at the
microscopic level of the sign. This implosion should be analyzed
according to McLuhan's formula, *the medium is the message*, the
consequences of which have yet to be exhausted.\
\
This means that all contents of meaning are absorbed in the only
dominant form of the medium. Only the medium can make an
event---whatever the contents, whether they are conformist or
subversive. A serious problem for all counterinformation, pirate radios,
antimedia, etc. But there is something even more serious, which McLuhan
himself did not see. Because beyond this neutralization of all content,
one could still expect to manipulate the medium in its form and to
transform the real by using the impact of the medium as form. If all the
content is wiped out, there is perhaps still a subversive, revolutionary
use value of the *medium as such.* That is---and this is where McLuhan's
formula leads, pushed to its limit---there is not only an implosion of
the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion
of the medium itself in the real, the implosion *of the medium and of
the real* in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition
and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined." \

"Assim é o terrorismo, original e insolúvel somente porque ataca não
importa onde, quando e quem, senão seria somente ato de resgate ou de
comando militar. Sua cegueira é a réplica exata da indiferenciação
absoluta do sistema, que há muito tempo não distingue os fins dos meios,
os carrascos das vitimas. Seu ato visa, na indistinção assassina da
tomada de reféns, exatamente o produto mais característico de todo o
sistema: o indivíduo anônimo e perfeitamente indiferenciado, o termo
substituível por qualquer outro. É preciso dizer paradoxalmente; os
inocentes pagam o crime de não serem nada, de serem sem destino, de
terem sido despossuídos de seu nome por um sistema também anônimo, de
que eles se tornaram, então, a mais pura encarnação. São os produtos
acabados do social, de uma sociabilidade abstrata doravante
mundializada. É nesse sentido, exatamente no sentido em que eles são
qualquer pessoa, que são as vítimas predestinadas pelo terrorismo." \

"Folkloric dances in the metro, innumerable campaigns for security, the
slogan "tomorrow I work" accompanied by a smile formerly reserved for
leisure time, and the advertising sequence for the election to the
Prud-hommes (an industrial tribunal): "I don't let anyone choose for
me"---an Ubuesque slogan, one that rang so spectacularly falsely, with a
mocking liberty, that of proving the social while denying it. It is not
by chance that advertising, after having, for a long time, carried an
implicit ultimatum of an economic kind, fundamentally saying and
repeating incessantly, "I buy, I consume, I take pleasure," today
repeats in other forms, "I vote, I participate, I am present, I am
concerned"---mirror of a paradoxical mockery, mirror of the indifference
of all public signification." \

"What did the torturers of the Inquisition want? The admission of evil,
of the principle of evil. It was necessary to make the accused say that
he was not guilty except by accident, through the incidence of the
principle of Evil in the divine order. Thus confession restored a
reassuring causality, and torture, and the extermination of evil through
torture, were nothing but the triumphal coronation (neither sadistic nor
expiatory) of the fact of having *produced Evil as cause.* Otherwise,
the least heresy would have rendered all of divine creation suspect." \

"O único referente que ainda funciona é o da maioria silenciosa. Todos
os sistemas atuais funcionam sobre essa entidade nebulosa, sobre essa
substância flutuante cuja existência não é mais social mas estatística,
e cujo único modo de aparição é o da sondagem. Simulação no horizonte do
social, ou melhor, no horizonte em que o social já desapareceu.\
\
O fato de a maioria silenciosa (ou as massas) ser um referente
imaginário não quer dizer que ela não existe. Isso quer dizer que não há
mais representação possível. As massas não são mais um referente porque
não têm mais natureza representativa. Elas não se expressam, são
sondadas. Elas não se refletem, são testadas. \
(\...)Bombardeadas de estímulos, de mensagens e de testes, as massas não
são mais do que um jazigo opaco, cego, como os amontoados de gases
estelares que só são conhecidos através da análise do seu espectro
luminoso - espectro de radiações equivalente às estatísticas e às
sondagens. Mais exatamente: não é mais possível se tratar de expressão
ou de representação, mas somente de simulação de um social para sempre
inexprimível e inexprimido. Esse é o sentido do seu silêncio. Mas esse
silêncio é paradoxal - não é um silêncio que fala, é um silêncio que
proíbe que se fale em seu nome. E, nesse sentido, longe de ser uma forma
de alienação, é uma arma absoluta.\
\
Ninguém pode dizer que representa a maioria silenciosa, e esta é sua
vingança. As massas não são mais uma instância à qual se possa referir
como outrora se referia à classe ou ao povo. Isoladas em seu silêncio,
não são mais sujeito (sobretudo,não da história), elas não podem,
portanto, ser faladas, articuladas, representadas, nem passar pelo
"estágio do espelho" político e pelo ciclo das identificações
imaginárias. Percebe-se que poder resulta disso: não sendo sujeito, elas
não podem ser alienadas - nem em sua própria linguagem (elas não têm
uma), nem em alguma outra que pretendesse falar por elas. Fim das
esperanças revolucionárias. Porque estas sempre especularam sobre a
possibilidade de as massas, como da classe proletária, se negarem
enquanto tais. Mas a massa não é um lugar de negatividade nem de
explosão, é um lugar de absorção e de implosão." \

"The media represents world that is more real than reality that we can
experience. People lose the ability to distinguish between reality and
fantasy. They also begin to engage with the fantasy without realizing
what it really is. They seek happiness and fulfillment through the
simulacra of reality, e.g. media and avoid the contact/interaction with
the real world." \

"It is the Left that secrets and desperately reproduces power, because
it wants power, and therefore the Left believes in it and revives it
precisely where the system puts an end to it. The system puts an end one
by one to all its axioms, to all its institutions, and realizes one by
one all the objectives of all the historical and revolutionary Left that
sees itself constrained to revive the wheels of capital in order to lay
siege to them one day: from private property to small business, from the
army to national grandeur, from puritan morality to petit bourgeois
culture, justice at the university---everything that is disappearing,
that the system, in its atrocity, certainly, but also in its
irreversible impulse, has liquidated, must be conserved." \

"In this country, it is not the highest virtue, nor the heroic act, that
achieves fame, but the uncommon nature of the least significant destiny.
There is plenty for everyone, then, since the more conformist the system
as a whole becomes, the more millions of individuals there are who are
set apart by some tiny peculiarity. The slightest vibration in a
statistical model, the tiniest whim of a computer are enough to bathe
some piece of abnormal behaviour, however banal, in a fleeting glow of
fame." \

"Pentru mine, universul seducției era cel care se opunea radical
universului producției. Nu mai era vorba de a face lucrurile să apară,
de a le fabrica, de a le produce pentru o lume a valorii, ci de a le
seduce, adică de la a le deturna de la această valoare, deci de la
identitatea lor, de la realitatea lor, pentru a le destina jocului
aparențelor, schimbului simbolic dintre ele. \[\...\] Seducția este un
joc mult mai fatal și mult mai riscant, care nu se opune câtuși de puțin
plăcerii, dar care, dimpotrivă, este altceva decât juisarea. Seducția
este o sfidare, o formă care întotdeauna caută să deregleze pe cineva
din punctul de vedere al identității sale, al sensului pe care cineva îl
poate căpăta pentru sine însuși. În seducție el regăsește posibilitatea
unei alterități radicale. Mi se pare că seducția are în vedere toate
formele care evită un sistem de acumulare, de producție. \[\...\]
Seducția este crima originară. Iar tentativele noastre de a pozitiva
lumea, de a-i da un sens unilateral, de felul imensei întreprinderi a
producției, au, fără doar și poate, drept scop să elimine, să abolească
acest tărâm, până la urmă, periculos, malefic, al seducției." \

"Eskiden deliler dilsizdi. Oysa bugün herkes onları dinlemektedir çünkü
günümüzde, eskiden saçma ve çözülmesi olanaksız görünen deli mesajlarını
çözebilen bir yöntem bulunmuştur. Artık çocuklar da konuşmaktadır.
Çocuklar, artık büyüklerin evreni dışında kalan anlaşılması olanaksız
tuhaf yaratıklar değildirler. Anlam üreten çocukların bir anlamı
olmalıdır. Konuşmalarının nedeni onlara bir konuşma "özgürlüğünün"
tanınmış olması değil, büyüklerin kafayı çalıştırarak bu sessizliğin bir
tehdide dönüşmesini engelleyecek bir kurnazlık düşünmüş olmalarıdır.
İlkellere bile söz hakkı tanınmaktadır. Konuş -maları istenmekte ve
söyledikleri dinlenmektedir. Onlar artık bir hayvan gibi
görülmemektedir. Zaten Levi-Strauss'da ilkellerin zihinsel yapılarının
bizimkilerin aynısı olduğunu söylemedi mi? Psikanaliz de onları Ödip
kompleksi ve libidoyla buluşturmadı mı? Bize ait kodların tümüne
uyduklarına göre bir sorun yok demektir. Eskiden sessizliğe mahkûm etmiş
olduğumuz insanları bugün "konuşmaya" mahkûm ediyoruz. Doğal olarak
"farklı" şeyler söylüyoruz çünkü gündemi belirleyen madde:
"Farklılıktır". Tıpkı eskiden Akıl birliğinin gündemi belirlemiş olması
gibi. Bunda şaşıracak bir şey yok çünkü düzende bir değişiklik yok.
Aklın emperyalizminden sonra şimdi de farklılığın neo-emperyalizmi." \

Admirável conjunção dos que nada têm a dizer e das massas que não falam.

"Analysis is itself perhaps the decisive element of the immense process
of the freezing over of meaning. The surplus of meaning that theories
bring, their competition at the level of meaning is completely secondary
in relation to their coalition in the glacial and four-tiered operation
of dissection and transparency. One must be conscious that, no matter
how the analysis proceeds, it proceeds toward the freezing over of
meaning, it assists in the precession of simulacra and of indifferent
forms. The desert grows." \

### Orgy

#### ~~Otherness~~ difference is real marketable 

**Baudrillard'93 **\|Jean, still hasn\'t disappeared, The Transparency
of Evil: Essays on Extreme Phenomena, 124-132\|KZaidi

[[We are engaged in an orgy of discovery, exploration and \'invention\'
of the Other]{.mark}. An orgy of differences.]{.underline} We are
[procurers of encounter, pimps of interfacing and
interactivity]{.underline}. Once we get beyond the mirror of alienation
(beyond the mirror stage that was the joy of our childhood),
**[[structural differences multiply ad infinitum]{.mark} - in fashion,
in mores, in culture. Crude otherness, hard otherness - the othernesses
of race, of madness, of poverty - are done with. [Otherness]{.mark},
like everything else, [has fallen under the law of the
market]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the law of supply and demand. **[It has
become [a rare item]{.mark}]{.underline}** - hence its immensely [high
value on the psychological stock exchange, on the structural stock
exchange. Hence too the intensity of the ubiquitous simulation of the
Other. This is particularly striking in science fiction, where the chief
question is always \'What is the Other? Where is the Other?\' Of course
science fiction is merely a reflection of our everyday universe, which
is in thrall to a wild speculation on - almost a black market in -
otherness and difference]{.underline}. A veritable obsession with
ecology extends from Indian reservations to household pets (otherness
degree zero!) - not to mention [the other of \'the other scene\', or the
other of the unconscious]{.underline} (our last symbolic capital, and
one we had better look after, because reserves are not **[limitless).
[Our sources of otherness are indeed running out; we have exhausted the
Other as raw material]{.mark}. (]{.underline}**According to Claude
Gilbert, we are so desperate that we go digging through the rubble of
earthquakes and catastrophes.) [Consequently [the other is]{.mark} all
of a sudden no longer there to be exterminated, hated, rejected or
seduced, but instead [to be understood, liberated,]{.mark} coddled,
recognized.]{.underline} In addition to the Rights of Man, **[we now
also need the Rights of the Other. In a way we already have these, in
the shape of a universal Right to be Different. For [the orgy is also an
orgy of political and psychological comprehension]{.mark} of the
other]{.underline}** - even to the [point of resurrecting the other in
places where the other is no longer to be found. Where the Other was,
there has the Same come to be. And where there is no longer anything,
there the Other must come to be. We are no longer living the drama of
otherness. We are living the psychodrama of otherness, just as we are
living the psychodrama of \'sociality\']{.underline}, the psychodrama of
sexuality, the psychodrama of the body - and the melodrama of all the
above, courtesy of analytic metadiscourses. [[Otherness has become
sociodramatic,]{.mark} semiodramatic, melodramatic. All we do in
psychodrama - the psychodrama of contacts, of psychological tests, of
interfacing - is acro[batically simulate and dramatize the absence of
the other]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not only is otherness absent everywhere
in this artificial dramaturgy, but the [[subject has also quietly become
indifferent]{.mark} to his own subjectivity, to his own alienation, just
as the modern political animal has become indifferent to his own
political opinions. This subject becomes transparent,
spectral]{.underline} (to borrow Marc Guillaume\'s word) - and **[[hence
interactive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [For in interactivity the subject is
the other to no one. Inasmuch as he is indifferent to himself, it is as
though he had been reified alive - but without his double, without his
shadow, without his other.]{.underline} Having paid this price, th[e
[subject becomes a candidate for all possible combinations,]{.mark} all
possible connections. The interactive being is therefore born not
through a new form of exchange but through the disappearance of the
social, the disappearance of otherness. [This being is the other after
the death of the Other -]{.mark} not the same other at all: the [other
that results from the denial of the Other]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only
interaction involved, in reality, belongs to the medium alone: to the
machine become invisible. Mechanical [automata still played on the
difference between man and machine, and on the charm of this
difference]{.underline} - something with which today\'s interactive and
simulating automata are no longer concerned. [[Man and machine have
become isomorphic and indifferent to each other:]{.mark} neither is
other to the other. The computer has no other. That is why the computer
is not intelligent. Intelligence comes to us from the other - always.
That is why computers perform so well]{.underline}. Champions of mental
arithmetic and idiots savants are autistic - minds for which the other
does not exist and which, for that very reason, are endowed with strange
powers. [[This is]{.mark} the strength, too, of [the integrated
circuit]{.mark}]{.underline} (the power of thought-transference might
also be considered in this connection). Such is the [[power of
abstraction.]{.mark} Machines work more quickly because they are
unlinked to any otherness]{.underline}. Networks connect them up to one
another like an immense umbilical cord joining one intelligence and its
twin. Homeostasis between one and the same: all otherness has been
confiscated by the machine. Does [otherness survive anywhere after being
banished from this entire psychodramatic superstructure]{.underline}? Is
there a physics as well as a metaphysics of the Other? [Is there a dual,
not just a dialectical, form of otherness]{.underline}? Is there [still
a form of the Other as destiny, and not merely as a psychological or
social partner of convenience]{.underline}? These days everything is
described in terms of difference, but otherness is not the same thing as
difference. [One might even say that difference is what destroys
otherness]{.underline}. [When language is broken down into a set of
differences, when meaning is reduced to nothing more than
differentiation, the radical otherness of language is
abolished]{.underline}. The duel that lies at the heart of language -
the duel between language and meaning, between language and the person
who speaks it - is halted. And everything in language that is
irreducible to mediation, articulation or meaning is eliminated -
everything, that is, which causes language at its most radical level to
be other than the subject (and also Other to the subject?). The
[existence of this level accounts for the play in language, for its
appeal in its materiality, for its susceptibility to chance; and it is
what makes language not just a set of trivial differences]{.underline},
as it is in the eyes of structural analysis, but, symbolically speaking,
truly a matter of life and death. What, then, does it mean to say that
women are the other for men, that the mad are the other for the sane, or
that primitive people are the other for civilized people? One might as
well go on for ever wondering who is the other for whom. Is the Master
the slave\'s other? Yes, certainly - in terms of class and power
relations. But this account is reductionistic. In reality, things are
just not so simple. **[[The way in which beings and things relate to
each other is not a matter of structural difference. The symbolic order
implies dual and complex forms that are not dependent on the distinction
between ego and other]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Pariah is not the
other to the Brahmin: rather, their destinies are different. The two are
not differentiated along a single scale of values: rather, they are
mutually reinforcing aspects of an immutable order, parts of a
reversible cycle like the cycle of day and night. Do we say that the
night is the other to the day? No. So why should we say that the
masculine is the other to the feminine? For the two are undoubtedly
merely reversible moments, like night and day, following upon one other
and changing places with one another in an endless process of seduction.
One sex is thus never the other for the other sex, except within the
context of a differentialistic theory of sexuality - which is basically
nothing but a utopia. For [[difference is itself a utopia]{.mark}: the
idea that such pairs of terms can be split up is a dream - and the idea
of subsequently reuniting them is another]{.underline}. (This **[[also
goes for the distinction between Good and Evil]{.mark}: the [notion that
they might be separated]{.mark} out from one another [is pure
fantasy]{.mark},]{.underline}** and it is even more utopian to think in
terms of reconciling them.) Only in the distinction-based perspective of
our culture is it possible to speak of the Other in connection with sex.
Genuine sexuality, for its part, is \'exotic\' (in Segalen\'s meaning of
the term) : it resides in the radical incomparability of the sexes -
otherwise seduction would never be possible, and there would be nothing
but alienation of one sex by the other. [Di[fferences mean regulated
exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}[. But what is it that introduces disorder
into exchange? What is it that cannot be negotiated over? What is it
that has no place in the contract, or in the structural interaction of
differences? What is founded on the impossibility of
exchange?]{.underline} Wherever exchange is impossible, what we
encounter is terror. **[Any radical otherness at all is thus the
epicentre of a terror: the terror that such otherness
holds,]{.underline}** by virtue of its very existence, for the normal
world. **[And [the terror that this world exercises upon that otherness
in order to annihilate it.]{.mark} Over recent centuries all forms of
violent otherness have been incorporated, willingly or under threat of
force, into a discourse of difference which simultaneously implies
inclusion and exclusion, recognition and discrimination. [Childhood,
lunacy, death, primitive societies - all have been categorized]{.mark},
integrated and absorbed as parts of a universal harmony]{.underline}**.
Madness, once its exclusionary status had been revoked, was caught up in
the far subtler toils of psychology. **[The dead, as soon as they were
recognized in their identity as such, were [banished to outlying
cemeteries]{.mark} - kept at such a distance that the face of death
itself was lost]{.underline}**. As for Indians, their right to exist was
no sooner accorded them than they were confined to reservations. These
are the [vicissitudes of a logic of difference. [Racism does not exist
so long as the other remains Other]{.mark}, so long as the Stranger
remains foreign]{.underline}. It comes into existence when the other
[becomes merely different - that is to say, dangerously
similar.]{.underline} This is the moment when [the inclination to keep
the other at a distance comes into being.]{.underline} \'We may
assume\', wrote Victor Segalen, \'that fundamental [[differences will
never resolve themselves]{.mark} into a truly seamless and unpatched
fabric]{.underline}; increasing unity, falling barriers and great
reductions in real distance must of themselves compensate somewhere by
means of new partitions and unanticipated gaps: [Racism is one such
\'new partition\' . An abreaction to the psychodrama of difference: a
response to the phantasy of - and obsession with - becoming
\'other\']{.underline} . A way out of the psychodrama of [perpetual
introjection and rejection of the other. So intolerable is this
introjection of differences, in fact, that the other must be exorcized
at all costs by making the differences materially manifest]{.underline}.
The [biological claims of racism are without foundation but, by making
the racial reference clear, **[racism does reveal the logical temptation
at the heart of every structural system:]{.mark} the temptation [to
fetishize difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But differential systems
can never achieve equilibrium: **[differences oscillate constantly
between absolute highs and absolute lows.]{.underline}** When it comes
to the management of otherness and difference, [the idea of a
well-tempered balance is strictly utopian]{.underline}. Inasmuch as the
humanist logic of difference is in some sense a universal simulation
(one which culminates in the absurdity of a \'right to difference\'), it
leads directly, for all its benevolence, to that other desperate
hallucination of difference known as racism. [As differences and the
cult of differences continue to grow, another, unprecedented kind of
violence, anomalous and inaccessible to critical rationality, grows even
faster]{.underline}. Segalen\'s \'unanticipated gaps\' are not simply
new differences: **[what [springs up in order to combat the total
homogenization of the world is the Alien]{.mark} - monstrous metaphor
for the corpse-like, viral Other]{.underline}**: the compound form of
all the varieties of otherness done to death by our system. [This is a
racism which, for lack of any biological underpinning, seizes on the
very slightest variations in the order of signs; a racism which quickly
takes on a viral and automatic character, and perpetuates itself while
revelling in a generalized semiotics]{.underline}. And this [racism can
never be countered by any humanism of difference, for the simple reason
that it is itself the virus of difference.]{.underline} Sermonizing on
the internalization of the other and the introjection of differences can
never resolve the problem of the [monstrous forms of otherness, because
these forms are the product, precisely, of this selfsame obsessional
differentiation, this selfsame obsessional dialectic of ego and other.
Herein lies the whole weakness of those \'dialectical\' theories of
otherness which aspire to promote the proper use of
difference]{.underline}. For if racism in its viral, immanent, current
and definitive form proves anything, it is that there is no such thing
as the proper use of difference. This is why it may also be said that
the critique of racism is substantially finished - just as Marx said
that the critique of religion was substantially finished. Once the
vacuousness of the metaphysical account of religion had been
demonstrated, [religion was supposed to disappear as the conditions of a
more advanced mode of production became operative. Likewise, once the
vacuousness of the biological theory of races has been demonstrated,
racism is supposed to disappear as the conditions of a more advanced
universal intermixture of differences become operative.]{.underline} But
what if religion, for example, contrary to Marx\'s predictions, had lost
its metaphysical and transcendent form only to become an immanent force
and fragment into countless ideological and practical variants under the
conditions of a religious revival drawing sustenance from the progress
of the very social order that was expected to eradicate even the memory
of religion? For the signs of just such a turn of events are all around
us today. And much the same goes for racism, which has also become an
immanent, viral and everyday reality. **[The fact is that [the
\'scientific\' and rational critique of racism is a purely formal
one]{.mark}, which [demolishes the argument from biology]{.mark} but
remains [caught in the racist trap]{.mark} because it addresses a
biological illusion only, and fails to deal with biology]{.underline}**
itself qua illusion. Similarly, the [political and ideological critique
of racism is purely formal in that it tackles the racist obsession with
difference without tackling difference itself qua illusion]{.underline}.
It [thus [itself becomes an illusion of criticism,]{.mark} bearing on
nothing, and in the end racism turns out to have survived critique by
rationalism just as deftly as religion survived critique by
materialism]{.underline} - which is why all such critiques are indeed
substantially finished. There is no such thing as the proper use of
difference - a fact revealed not only by racism itself but also by all
anti-racist and humanitarian efforts to promote and protect differences.
Hu[manitarian ecumenism, the ecumenism of differences, is in a
cul-de-sac: the cul-de-sac of the concept of the universal itself. The
most recent illustration of this, in France, was the brouhaha over the
wearing of headscarves for religious reasons by North African
schoolgirls.]{.underline} All the rational arguments mustered in this
connection turned out to be nothing but hypocritical attempts to get rid
of the simple fact that no solution is to be found in any moral or
political theory of difference. [It is difference itself that is a
reversible illusion. We are the ones who brought difference to the four
corners of the earth]{.underline}: that it **[[should now be returned to
us in unrecognizable,]{.mark} Islamic, fundamentalist and irreducible
forms is no bad thing]{.underline}**. The guilt we feel in this
connection assumes gigantic proportions. Not long ago the organization
Medecins Sans Frontieres became aware that the medical supplies it had
been distributing in Afghanistan were being resold rather than used
directly by their recipients. This precipitated a crisis of conscience
for the programme\'s organizers. Should donations be discontinued, or
should this immoral and irregular commerce be tolerated out of respect
for \'cultural differences\'? After much soul-searching it was decided
to sacrifice Western values on the altar of difference, and continue to
underwrite the black market in medicines. Humanisme oblige. Another
[charming illustration of the confusion besetting our humanitarians
concerns X, posted to the Sudan to study \'the communications needs of
Sudanese peoples\' . Seemingly, the Sudanese did not know how to
communicate. But they were certainly hungry, and needed to learn how to
grow sorghum. Sending agronomists being too expensive a prospect, the
decision had been taken to teach by videocassette]{.underline}. The time
had come for the Sudanese to join the communications revolution: sorghum
via audio and video. No hook-up, no eat. It was not long before towns
and villages were crammed with VCRs. A little longer, and the [local
[mafia created a lucrative market for itself in pornographic
videotapes]{.mark} which held a distinctly greater interest for the
populace than educational cassettes on sorghum cultivation.
Porno-SorghoVideo: The Same Struggle! The risibility of our altruistic
\'understanding\' is rivalled only by the profound contempt it is
designed to conceal. For \'We respect the fact that you are
different\']{.underline} read: **[[\'You people who are underdeveloped
would do well to hang on to this distinction because it is all you have
left\']{.underline}]{.mark}** . (The signs of folklore and poverty are
excellent markers of difference.) Nothing could be more contemptuous -
or more contemptible - than this attitude, which exemplifies the most
radical form of incomprehension that exists. It has nothing to do,
however, with what Segalen calls \'eternal incomprehensibility\' .
Rather, it is a product of eternal stupidity - of that stupidity which
endures for ever in its essential arrogance, **[[feeding on the
differentness of other people]{.mark}. Other cultures, meanwhile, have
never laid claim to universality. Nor did they ever claim to be
different - until difference was forcibly injected into them as part of
a sort of cultural opium war]{.underline}**. [They live on the basis of
their own singularity, their own exceptionality, on the irreducibility
of their own rites and values. They find no comfort in the lethal
illusion that all differences can be reconciled]{.underline} - an
**[[illusion that for them spells only annihilation]{.mark}. To master
the universal symbols of otherness and difference is to [master the
world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Those who conceptualize difference are
anthropologically superior - naturally, because it is they who invented
anthropology. And they have all the rights, because rights, too, are
their invention. Those who do not conceptualize difference, who do not
play the game of difference, must be exterminated. The Indians of
America, when the Spanish landed, are a case in point. [They understood
nothing about difference; they inhabited radical otherness.]{.underline}
(The Spaniards were not different in their eyes: they were simply gods,
and that was that.) This is the reason for the fury with which the
Spaniards set about destroying these peoples, a fury for which there was
no religious justification, nor economic justification, nor any other
kind of justification, except for the fact that the Indians were guilty
of an absolute crime: their failure to understand difference. When they
found themselves obliged to become part of an otherness no longer
radical, but negotiable under the aegis of the universal concept, they
preferred mass self-immolation - whence the fervour with which they, for
their part, allowed themselves to die: a counterpart to the Spaniards\'
mad urge to kill. The Indians\' strange collusion in their own
extermination represented their only way of keeping the secret of
otherness.

I. Introduction This article is an autobiographical encounter with
Baudrillard and his work, analyzing [an episode of hyperreality of 2003
Iraq War in which I was personally implicated - [**the use of
intelligence reports** by both the British and American governments **to
justify an invasion** of Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The US and
UK [governments devised strategies to communicate]{.mark} to domestic
and international [publics]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} posed by the
collusion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Usama bin Ladin's Al-Qaida, when
historically both parties had an antagonistic relationship with one
another]{.underline}. As part of this effort, the British [**[government
issued intelligence reports on Iraq's WMD program]{.mark} for public
scrutiny**, [and in the process **my**]{.mark} **doctoral
[research]{.mark} on Iraq [was plagiarized]{.mark}** [and
**incorporated** into]{.mark} one of [these
documents.]{.mark}]{.underline} This study also adopts the technique
used by Elizabeth Dauphinee in The Politics of Exile, an academic work
that employs storytelling, creating a narrative where the scholar serves
as the protagonist while conducting research on the Bosnian civil war
that raged between 1992 and 1995 (Dauphinee, 2013). Abandoning the
generally depersonalized nature of academic writing, her work centers
the individuals caught up in this conflict, taking the reader into their
personal lives and domestic spaces. Following Dauphinee's approach, this
study starts from the living room of a teenaged Iraqi-American, to the
halls of the British Parliament as a doctoral student, and the impact of
the plagiarism on my life as an academic.
[[Hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark} according to Baudrillard **[[blurs
the distinctions between the real and the unreal]{.mark}. My experience
fits in to the realm of hyperreality as [the real "Ibrahim
Al-Marashi"]{.mark} or the real research I conducted [was artificially
(re)produced as a real retouched and refurbished in "a hallucinatory
resemblance" with itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard,1983, 23).
Botz-Bornstein's definition follows as: "**[[Hyperreality creates its
own standards of reality]{.mark}, independently of any [outside 'real'
condition]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (2013). [[After the invasion of Iraq
**no evidence of Baghdad's WMD arsenal was found**, revealing that
the]{.mark} underlining **[rationale]{.mark} for the invasion [of a
threat never existed]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[In]{.mark} the
process of [creating this illusion, the]{.mark} **intelligence
[reports]{.mark} themselves [had served as part of the hyperreal
simulation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the Iraqi [threat]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
as **these [reports had no basis]{.mark}** [on a real threat, they had
to be **manufactured**]{.mark} **or manipulated**, [leading to the
**plagiarism of my own research**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A government
caught in the act of plagiarism on this scale had been unprecedented,
but [[media establishments and commentators]{.mark}, in their zeal to
criticize the British and American governments, often [misrepresented
the facts of what was plagiarized and how did it occur,]{.mark} often
**[invoking my name as a symbol that exposed government
deception]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[The media's role in
unveiling]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the plagiarism [granted the fifth
estate the notion of agency]{.mark} in unraveling a deceptive
simulation, yet [in the process I became a simulated character
representing "truth" in the face of government
fakery]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [While [my experience]{.mark} served to
unveil the simulation of an Iraqi threat while it was being constructed,
it simultaneously [contributed to the construction of a
**concurrent**]{.mark} **[simulation of the mass media]{.mark} unveiling
this government simulation**.]{.underline} The British government,
having invested its reputation in the veracity of the intelligence
reports, [continued to communicate to the media that the reports were
accurate despite minor flaws, while the media obtained newsworthy
information by attacking every effort made by the British government in
its attempt to validate these reports]{.underline}. **[[I had
disappeared into two simulations, yet both simulations needed the
other]{.mark} antagonistic simulation [to exist.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Blair's [government was concerned with **maintaining its
illusion**]{.mark},]{.underline} and **[while the image of "intelligence
reports" was tarnished, [by vouching for the overall accuracy of a
report based on my research, the first simulation would remain
intact]{.mark} in their eyes]{.underline}**. The [British government
spokesperson downgraded its intelligence report to a background briefing
document for journalists and the public produced by Number 10's media
liaison team]{.underline}. In the eyes of the British government, [since
my original research was accurate, their intelligence dossier contained
the truth. **The need to vouch for the truth in this dossier was
critical**]{.underline} [for the British government as the document
played a role in justifying the invasion of Iraq among British
policymakers]{.underline}. The [dossier based on my work was presented
in the British Parliament as one of the final documents that convinced
this body to support the UK's involvement in the 2003 Iraq
War]{.underline}. Tom Dalyell, the longest serving member in the House
of Commons, stated, "To plagiarize an out of date Ph.D. thesis and to
present it as an official report of the latest British intelligence
information, surely [it reveals a lack of awareness of the disastrous
consequences of such a deception]{.underline}." He added, "This is not a
trivial leak. It is a document on which is the basis of whether or not
this country goes to war and whether or not young servicemen and
servicewomen are to put their own lives at risk and indeed thousands,
tens of thousands of innocent civilians," (Johnson 2003). [As much I
wanted to minimize the significance of my involvement in this whole
affair, I felt a sense of guilt that I had indirectly provided the
information that justified a war against my native Iraq]{.underline}.
Dalyell further stated, "And the basis that has been produced by a PhD
student in California who now says that he is against conflict,
apparently, is the heart of what purports to be the intelligence
briefing of the British government" (ibid.) [It seemed my ambivalence in
the press interviews I gave after the revelation did not translate well
into whether I was pro-war or anti-war. Reuters had quoted me as saying,
"As an Iraqi, I support regime change in Iraq]{.underline}" (History
Commons, 2003). However, **[Dalyell quoted me as being against the
conflict.]{.underline}** Both were right. [While I had lost members of
my family to the security services after the 1991 Iraqi uprising, I
still feared that military action against Iraq could have caused harm to
my surviving relatives there]{.underline}. I opposed an Anglo-American
war against Iraq that could possibly result in unintended consequences
for the Iraqi people, yet I desired that Saddam Hussein rule over Iraq
end. **[My [dilemma of being pro or anti-war is described by Baudrillard
as a "forced referendum," or a binary logic in news and political
rhetoric to be for or against the war, without actually questioning its
credibility or level of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard,
\[1995\] 2009, 28). **[At the moment [I was receiving the media
attention for this incident, I was often asked by journalists if I was
for or against the]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [I always paused
before this question as I never had a convenient answer
ready.]{.underline} At that juncture **[[the plagiarism of my research
forced me to question the entire reality of the justifications of the
2003 Iraq War]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [I wondered [how could I be "for"
a war, since if the evidence for the war was being manufactured, so too
would the claim of the war to bring freedom to Iraq or making the world
safe from WMD]{.mark}s.]{.underline} Second, **[to be pro or anti-war
seemed futile]{.underline}**. Given my detailed study of the weak state
of the Iraqi military, **[I knew that a war in 2003 with the US would be
over relatively quickly]{.underline}**. [I often wanted to answer the
journalists' question with the response, If a football game is fixed
what is the point of rooting for a team? The teams may go through the
motions of a contested match but there would be no doubt as to the
winner]{.underline}. Yet, the **[[short sound bites required of an
interview for a newspaper or news report rarely allowed the time for
such nuance and irony, which explains how I could be both pro-war and
anti-war.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

### War Porn

#### Nothing becomes wholly transparent without becoming entirely enigmatic.

**Baudrillard'05** \|Jean Baudrillard, \"War Porn,\" Trans. Paul A.
Taylor, International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1
(January 2005)\|KZaidi

\...[[tomorrow there will be nothing but the virtual violence]{.mark} of
consensus]{.underline}, the [[simultaneity in real]{.mark} [time]{.mark}
of the global consensus]{.underline}: this will happen tomorrow and [it
will be the beginning of a wo[rld with no tomorrow]{.mark}.]{.underline}
\...This is [what the Americans seek to do]{.underline}, these
missionary people bearing electro-shocks which will [[shepherded
everyone towards democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is [therefore
[pointless to question the political]{.mark} [aims of]{.mark} this [war:
the only]{.mark}]{.underline} (transpolitical) [[aim is to align
everybody with]{.mark} the global lowest common denominator, the
[democratic denominator]{.mark}]{.underline}\... \...the [New World
Order will be both consensual and televisual]{.underline}. That is
indeed why the targeted bombings carefully avoided the Iraqi television
antennae\...[The crucial stake]{.underline}, the decisive stake in this
whole affair is the consensual reduction of Islam to the global order.3
\* \* \* [[World Trade Center: shock treatment of power]{.mark},
humiliation inflicted on power]{.underline}, but [from
outside]{.underline}. With the images of the Baghdad prisons, it is
worse, it is the humiliation, [[symbolic and completely fatal]{.mark},
[which the world power inflicts on itself]{.mark} -- the Americans in
this particular case -- the shock treatment of shame and bad conscience.
This is what binds together the two events.]{.underline} Before both a
[worldwide violent reaction: in the first case a feeling of wonder, in
the second, a feeling of abjection.]{.underline} For September 11th, the
[[exhilarating images of a major event]{.mark}; in the other, the
degrading images of something that is the opposite of an
event]{.underline}, a [[non-event of an obscene
banality]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [degradation]{.underline}, atrocious
but banal, not [only of the victims]{.underline}, but of the [amateur
scriptwriters of this parody of violence.]{.underline} The worst is that
it [[all becomes a parody of violence, a parody of the war itself,
pornography becoming the ultimate form of the abjection of war which is
unable to be simply war]{.mark}, to be simply about killing, and
[instead turns itself into a grotesque infantile reality-show,]{.mark}
in a desperate [simulacrum of power]{.mark}.]{.underline} These [[scenes
are the illustration of a power]{.mark} which, reaching its extreme
point, [no longer knows what to do with itself]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a
power henceforth without aim, without purpose, without a plausible
enemy, and in total impunity. It is only capable of inflicting
gratuitous humiliation and, as one knows, [violence inflicted on others
is after all only an expression of the violence inflicted on
oneself.]{.underline} It [[only manages to humiliate itself, degrade
itself and go back on its own word in]{.mark} a sort of unremitting
perversity. The ignominy, the vileness is the ultimate symptom of a
power that no longer knows what to do with itself. September 11th was a
global reaction from all those who no longer knew what to make of this
world power and who no longer supported it.]{.underline} In the case of
the abuse inflicted on the Iraqis, it is worse yet: [[power no longer
knows what to do with itself]{.mark} and [cannot stand itself]{.mark},
unless it engages in self-parody in an inhuman manner. [These images
are]{.mark} as [murderous]{.mark} for America as those of the World
Trade Center in flames]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [America in itself is
not on trial, and it is useless to charge the Americans: [the infernal
machine exploded in literally suicidal acts]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, the [Americans have been overtaken by their own
power.]{.underline} They [do not have the means to control]{.underline}
it. And now [**[we are part of this power. The bad conscience of the
entire West is crystallized]{.mark} in these** images. [The whole West
is contained in the burst of the sadistic laughter of the American
soldiers]{.mark}, as it is behind the construction of the Israeli wall.
This is where the truth of these images lies; [this is what they are
full of: the excessiveness of a power designating itself as abject and
pornographic.]{.mark} Truth but not veracity]{.underline}: it [does not
help to know whether the images are true or false]{.underline}. From now
on and forever [[we will be uncertain about these images.]{.mark} Only
their impact counts in the way in which they are [immersed in the
war]{.mark}. There is no longer the need for \"embedded\" journalists
because [soldiers]{.mark} themselves [are immersed in the image]{.mark}
-- thanks to digital technology, the [images are definitively integrated
into the war]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [don¹t represent it anymore;
[they involve neither distance, nor perception, nor
judgment]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [no longer belong to the order of
representation, nor of information in a strict sense. And, [suddenly,
the question whether it is necessary to produce]{.mark}, reproduce,
broadcast, or [prohibit them]{.mark}, or even the \"essential\"
[question of how to know if they are true or false, is
\"irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}[\".]{.mark} [For the [images]{.mark}
to become a source of true information, they would have to be different
from the war.]{.underline} They have [[become today as virtual as the
war itself]{.underline}]{.mark}, and for this reason their specific
[[violence adds to the specific violence]{.mark} of the
war.]{.underline} In addition, [due to their omnipresence, due to the
prevailing rule of the world of making everything visible, [the
images]{.mark}]{.underline}, our present-day images, have
[[become]{.mark} substantially [pornographic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Spontaneously, [they [embrace the pornographic face of the war.]{.mark}
There exists]{.underline} in all this, in particular in the last Iraqi
episode, [an immanent justice of the image: **th[ose who live by the
spectacle will die by the ]{.mark}**[spectacle.]{.mark} Do you want to
acquire power through the image? Then [you will perish by the return of
the image.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[Americans are having]{.mark} and
will make of it [a bitter experience]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[this]{.underline} in spite of all the \"democratic\" subterfuges and
the hopeless simulacrum of transparency which [[corresponds to the
hopeless simulacrum of military power]{.mark}. Who committed these acts
and who is really responsible for them]{.underline}? Military superiors?
Human nature, bestial as one knows, \"even in democracy\"? [The [true
scandal is no longer in the torture]{.mark}, [it is in the
treachery]{.mark} of those who knew and who said nothing]{.underline}
(or of those who revealed it?). In any event, [all real [violence is
diverted by the question of transparency]{.mark}]{.underline} --
[democracy trying to [make a virtue out of]{.mark} the
[disclosure]{.mark} of its vices]{.underline}. But apart from all this,
[what is the secret of these abject scenographies?]{.underline} Once
again, [they are an answer, beyond all the strategic and political
adventures, to the humiliation of September 11th, and they want to
answer to it by even worse humiliation -- even worse than
death.]{.underline} Without counting the hoods which are already a form
of decapitation (to which the decapitation of the American corresponds
obscurely), without counting the piling-up of bodies, and the dogs,
forced nudity is in itself a rape. One saw the GIs walking the naked and
chained Iraqis through the city and, in the short story Allah Akhbar by
Patrick Dekaerke, [one sees Franck, the [CIA agent, making an Arab
strip, forcing him into a girdle]{.mark} and net stockings, and then
[making him sodomize a pig, all that while taking photographs which he
will send]{.mark} to his village and all his close relations. [Thus the
other will be exterminated symbolically]{.mark}]{.underline}. One sees
that [[the goal of the war is not to kill or to win, but abolish the
enemy, extinguish]{.underline}]{.mark} (according to Canetti, I believe)
[[the light]{.mark} of his sky.]{.underline} And, in fact, [what does
one want these men to acknowledge]{.underline}? Wh[at is the secret one
wants to extort from them? [It is quite simply the name in virtue of
which they have no fear of death.]{.mark} Here is the [profound jealousy
and the revenge of \"zero death]{.mark}\"]{.underline} on those men who
are not afraid -- [it is in that [name that they are inflicted with
something worse than death... Radical shamelessness]{.mark}, the
[dishonor]{.mark} of nudity, the tearing of any veil. It is [always the
same problem of transparency]{.mark}:]{.underline} to [[tear off the
veil]{.mark} of women or abuse men to [make them appear more naked, more
obscene\...]{.mark}]{.underline} This [[masquerade crowns the ignominy
of the war]{.mark} -- until this travesty, it was present in this most
ferocious image]{.underline} (the most ferocious for America), because
it [was most ghostly and most \"reversible\": the prisoner threatened
with electrocution and, completely hooded, like]{.underline} a member of
the Ku Klux Klan, crucified by its ilk. [[It is really America that has
electrocuted itself.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[In addition to careful management of images and information
content]{.underline}, the true [[devastation of war is kept at bay from
our perceptions by simulation technologies]{.mark} ranging from the
televisual screen to the military 'smart weapons' deployed from
altitudes of tens of thousands of feet. During months of preparation for
the 'war', viewers experience [endless military experts paraded across
their screen]{.mark}, endlessly analyzing scenarios before they happen.
The pilot in his simulator cockpit, or the gunner in his high-tech tank,
is surrounded by a virtual environment and motion-dependent images which
are the same whether he is in a war game training exercise or a 'real
engagement']{.underline}. A Non-Euclidean Spacetime The [post-[structure
of the (non-)war]{.mark} machine in the age of media virtuality has the
[property of complex]{.mark} intricate paradoxical
[topology]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} There is the "[non-Euclidean"
spacetime]{.underline} of [multiple refracting waves in an enigmatic
hyperspace beyond any classical geometry]{.underline}. In "The Gulf War:
Is It Really Taking Place?," Baudrillard (1995: 49-50) writes: [At a
certain speed, the [speed of information, things lose their
sense]{.mark}]{.underline}[...]{.mark} [[War implodes in real
time]{.mark}, history implodes in real time, all communication and all
signification implode in real time... The [space of the event has become
a hyperspace]{.mark} with multiple refractivity, and that the space of
war has become definitively non-Euclidean.]{.underline} To understand
the complex non-Euclidean informational space of non-war, we [need a new
mathematics, a new unconventional metric space.]{.underline} In
mathematics, a metric space is a set where a specific concept of
distance between elements of the set is defined and implemented.
[Three-dimensional Euclidean space -- a way of thinking about space that
[belongs to the Western metaphysical 'construction of
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} as it was originated by the
Ancient Greek thinkers -- [corresponds to our 'intuitive understanding'
of space.]{.underline} 1991 Persian Gulf War Shortly before 7 PM on the
evening of January 16, 1991 (January 17, early AM, in the Gulf),
[Network nightly [news]{.mark} viewers were [informed]{.mark} that heavy
bombing of strategic targets inside Iraq had been
initiated]{.underline}. At 9 PM, President George H.W.
[Bush]{.underline} enthusiastically [told the viewing audience that
["the liberation of Kuwait has begun]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Pentagon
spokespersons explained that massive pinpoint strikes by high-tech
planes against carefully selected military sites and command
headquarters had caught the Iraqis entirely off guard. Reports of great
success came in. The [nation rejoiced]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was our
grand celebration. [We feted our triumph in the Cold War. The glamorous
high-tech weapons, developed and paid for over years, could finally be
used in the real thing, and the Soviets were nowhere in sight. We were
back. After the wrenching stalemate of Vietnam, [we could finally start
again. The enemy was an inert physical installation, a blip on a radar
screen to be methodically darkened.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Fourth
Order of Simulacra The [post-structure of the [(non-)war machine]{.mark}
in the age of media virtuality has the [property of viral]{.mark}
[metastasis]{.mark}. There is the news [media becoming part of the
terror]{.mark}. There are the [surveillance policies]{.mark} of the
state [becoming]{.mark} part of the [terror]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
essay "After the Orgy" in the book The Transparency of Evil,
[Baudrillard writes of the "epidemic of simulation,]{.underline}" a
[networked mode of fractal or viral dispersal.]{.underline} Updating his
famous theses of "the three orders of simulacra" (in Symbolic Exchange
and Death) and "the precession of simulacra" (in Simulacra and
Simulation), he [seeks to [introduce "a new particle into the
microphysics of simulacra]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1993: 5):
The [first of these stages had a [natural referent,]{.mark} and [value
developed on the basis of a natural use of the world.]{.mark} The second
was founded []{.mark}on a general equivalence, and value developed by
reference to a logic of the commodity. The third is [governed by a
code,]{.mark} and value develops here by reference to a [set of
models.]{.mark} At the fourth, the fractal (or viral, or radiant) stage
of value, there is no point of reference at all, and value radiates in
all directions...]{.underline}(Ibid.: 5, 7). [This is the fractal or
[viral stage]{.mark} of fourth-order simulacra]{.underline}. In
Baudrillard's post-simulation epistème or \"[epidemic of
simulation[,]{.mark}\" value - if that term is still appropriate -
[radiates in all directions]{.mark} in a cancerous metastasis. There is
\"no relationship between cause and effect, merely viral relationships
between one effect and another"]{.underline} (Ibid.: 108). [All spheres
of society pass into their free-floating, excessive, and ecstatic
form.]{.underline} September 11, 2001 In "The Spirit of Terrorism," the
first essay of the book The Spirit of Terrorism(2002), Baudrillard
writes of the event of September 11, 2001: The [[more concentrated the
system becomes]{.mark} globally, ultimately forming one single network,
the [more it becomes vulnerable at a single point]{.mark} (already a
single little Filipino hacker had managed, from the the dark recesses of
his portable computer, to [launch the 'I love you' virus,]{.mark} which
circled the globe [devastating]{.mark} entire
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline})... [[Terrorism,]{.mark} like viruses,
[is everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a [global perfusion of
terrorism]{.underline}, which [accompanies any system of domination as
though it were its shadow, ready to activate itself anywhere, like a
double agent.]{.underline} We [can no longer draw a demarcation line
around it. It is at the very heart of this culture which combats it...
Terrorism is the [shock wave]{.mark} of this silent
reversion]{.underline} (2002: 8-9, 10, 11). [After each terrorist
attack, [there is]{.mark} a feeling in the air of
[panic]{.mark}]{.underline} and confusion in the news media as the
police and Federal Investigators identify and catch the perpetrators,
and the [[information society scrambles to find out 'who did
it']{.mark}.]{.underline} Abu Ghraib Torture and Prisoner Abuse This is
how the English-language Wikipedia article on "Abu Ghraib Torture and
Prisoner Abuse" begins: During the War in Iraq, human rights violations,
committed from late 2003 to early 2004, in the form of physical,
psychological, and sexual abuse, including torture, reports of rape,
sodomy, and homicide of prisoners held in the Abu Ghraib prison
(currently known as the Baghdad Central Prison) came to public attention
beginning in early 2004 with Department of Defense announcements. These
acts were committed by military police personnel of the United States
Army together with those of additional US governmental
agencies.[1](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-shapiro.html#ft-endnote1)
On May 19, 2004, Jean Baudrillard published the essay "Pornographie de
la guerre" in the Parisian daily newspaper Libération. (published as
"War Porn" in English) The philosopher, sociologist, and media theorist
writes: [World Trade Center: shock treatment of power, humiliation
inflicted on power, but from outside. With the images of the Baghdad
prisons, it is worse, it is the humiliation, symbolic and completely
fatal, which the world power inflicts on itself -- the Americans in this
particular case -- the shock treatment of shame and bad conscience. This
is what binds together the two events]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2004).
To [keep the hyper-reality of cyberwar going, the ghost-people must
continue to [exercise a]{.mark} certain ['minimal' function in the
real]{.mark}.]{.underline} To [lend the game its requisite weight or
support]{.underline}, they [must furnish a necessary dose of
reality-effect]{.underline} through the [chalking up of their
disappearance.]{.underline} A [certain number of [victims]{.mark} of
torture, rape, and murder are [required to provide
data]{.mark}]{.underline} ('fresh meat') [to [keep the electronic
killing game going]{.mark}, especially if they can be photographed, and
then the images sent out on the universal image-viewing
network.]{.underline} Baudrillard continues in "War Porn": [This is
where the truth of these images lies; this is what they are full of: the
excessiveness of a [power designating itself as abject and
pornographic]{.mark}. Truth but not veracity: it does not help to know
whether the images are true or false]{.underline}... There is [no longer
the need for 'embedded' journalists because soldiers themselves are
immersed in the image -- thanks to digital technology, the [images
are]{.mark} definitively [integrated into the war. They don¹t represent
it]{.mark} anymore; they involve neither distance, nor perception, nor
judgment]{.underline}...(Ibid.). [Media images]{.underline} in general
-- in advertising, for example -- [signify the excess of wealth that we

and disgusting [images of the Abu Ghraib]{.mark} torture and prisoner
abuse atrocity are the [dark underside]{.mark} of media
culture.]{.underline} Beyond the epistemology of true and false, the
[digital [technology image has inscribed within itself the tautological
reasoning]{.mark} of the self-fulfilling prophecy, inheriting from
advertising and the classical era of consumer culture the mastery of the
art of rendering things true by saying that they are.]{.underline} For
Baudrillard, [all [images]{.mark} in contemporary culture [tend towards
the pornographic]{.mark}. The visual culture of stylized images is
obscene and pornographic at every level -- from hard-core porno to
'music television', from swimsuit magazines to commonplace TV
commercials.]{.underline}

### The Code

#### Their call to forensic ecology replaces alterity with codes of difference and sameness. This blurs the lines of the subject and enhances the power of simulacra

**Gupta '15** /Indrani Das, M.Phil English Jamia Millia Islamia

International Journal of Research, Vol. 2 Iss. 3,
http://www.internationaljournalofresearch.org/index.php/ijr/article/view/1735/1632/

In the postcolonial contexts particularly, the distinctiveness of
identity is predicated upon notion of space, "located elsewhere".
However, people who inhabit the peripheries, what Anzaldua called the
"narrow strip along steep edges" (Gupta and Ferguson 7), forces us to
rethink the identity/difference dichotomization. The structuring
polarization between identity as positive and difference as negative
needs to be questioned, and [[the need of the hour is to]{.mark} move
along the lines of differences structured in accordance with the
"precession of the model" to [rethink the subjectivities configured in
accordance with a logic of simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}McCarthy xiii). [[With the places and localities becoming
blurred and indeterminate in the implosion of the simulation of
reference,]{.underline}]{.mark} Baudrillard's fourth 'fractal' order,
[the [erasure of all differences, has led to a renewed interest in the
culturally and ethnic distinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Simulacra and
hyperreality allows for a re-examination of the Postcolonial
subject]{.underline}]{.mark} [under question as well as [problematize
the production and dissemination of knowledge in relation to identity
and cultural difference]{.mark}. In the hyperreal mode, [the
representation]{.mark} or image, [no longer denotes the
referent]{.mark}, as [the sign has itself become the real.]{.mark} "The
territory no longer precedes the map, but rather the map precedes the
territory. [The image bears no relation to reality, it is its own
simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 11). [[Hyperreality
facilitates an interrogation of the 'real' in both colonialist and
anti-colonialist discourses making us aware of]{.mark}]{.underline}
Kristeva's "[[writing as experience-limits]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Hutcheon 8). [If [identity established in these
discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} [is]{.mark} "no longer a question of
imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody", but ["[a question of
substituting the signs of the real for the real]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard 2), [one could read that "[colonialism and neo-imperialism
are functions of a broader Western civilizational strategy of
obfuscating the hidden absence of the 'real' by simulating reality as
normative]{.mark}]{.underline}" ( qtd. in McCarthy ix). As William
Merrin signals, Baudrillard's work can be understood most fruitfully as
occupying a space between historicity and philosophy. [[As a]{.mark}n
ideological [site for]{.mark} the [negotiation of
postcoloniality]{.mark}, [hyperreality allows postcolonial subjects to
move beyond merely identifying with the past (with a retrograde
voyeurism) to a deconstructive identification with unfixable and
positional identities within the simulacrum]{.mark}]{.underline} (qtd.
in McCarthy xx). Now, [with the "whole edifice of representation, being
a simulation"]{.underline} (Baudrillard 11), [one needs to
ask]{.underline} in the words of Clifford, ["what processes rather than
essences are involved in the present experience of cultural
identity]{.underline}" (qtd. in Gupta and Ferguson 14). [[Hyperreality
critiques "the imperialist and colonialist notions of purity as much as
it question\[s\] the nationalist notions]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Bhabha
64). [Baudrillard's views on simulacra and hyperreality shifts the
ground considerably, in its insistence to question what is at stake on
the importance of "irreducible difference]{.underline}" (Grace 89[).
[This 'strategic essentialisms']{.underline}]{.mark} to use Spivak's
term, [[obfuscates the situatedness, locatedness which cannot be
subsumed within the all-pervasive notions of identity based on
oppositional binaries]{.underline}. [Hyperreality tends to highlight the
limitations of an identity based on the fragmented space of 'imagined
communities' of a modern]{.underline} ]{.mark}[state.]{.underline} [And
the rapid advances in technology and the processes of globalization
which have resulted in new configurations of margins and peripheries
marked by migrations and the diasporic community]{.underline}, what is
termed by Gupta and Ferguson, [as 'the transnational public sphere'
meaning that the fiction of the postcolonial nation- state, whose
boundaries enclose cultures and regulate cultural exchange can no longer
be sustained.]{.underline} [[Baudrillard's description of consumptive
society inundated with simulated images "offers a 'paradoxical space"
for the agency of the subject, facilitating both creative potential and
selfdefining possibilities being also subjected identities to the law of
the market]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The "reversibility" implied in the
"images preceding the real" is particularly important in terms of the
debates around identity predicted on difference as [it]{.mark}
eventually [shows the fictionality of all discourses about identity and
cultural differences exemplifying the change implicit in "collective
memory and orientation]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Rojek 115). Conclusion
[[The world of Baudrillard cannot be said to be devoid of agency, or
nihilistic as one is continuously aware of being a part of simulations,
a world of consumption, which allows for "the radical operation of the
interrogating the 'otherness' of the other]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Gupta
and Ferguson 16). To conclude, [[hyperreality critiques the identity
realized on]{.underline}]{.mark} what Arjun Appadurai has termed [[the
"spatial incarceration of the native",]{.mark} and allows for a
rethinking of the relations between "culture, power, and
space"]{.underline} (Gupta and Ferguson 17). ). Moreover, [through the
myriad images/signs which constitute our culture, [our identity is
constantly renewed and expanded with the "signs being appropriated,
translated, rehistoricised and read anew]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Bhabha
37).

#### The code is really fucked up and probs coopts the aff

**Pawlett 08** \|William Pawlett (Sociology and Cultural Studies,
University of Wolverhampton, UK), Hate/Code,
<http://intertheory.org/pawlett.htm>\|KZaidi

[Baudrillard's concept of the Code was clearly influenced by the
development of Structuralist semiotics]{.underline}, including Lacan's
reading of Saussure which yielded the important notions of the
"Saussurian bar" and the "primacy" of the signifier (Lacan 1966/2007). A
less overt, but perhaps more telling, influence on Baudrillard was
Nietzsche's attack on the metaphysical foundations of western
rationalism.  Of particular importance to Baudrillard's later work is
[Nietzsche's [contrasting of being and becoming and]{.mark} his
[contention that **modern individuals are imprisoned by**]{.mark} **a
system of [rationality]{.mark}**, indebtedness [and **"oppressive
narrowness**]{.mark}**"** in which "man impatiently ripped himself
apart"]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1887/1994, n. 16).  Nietzsche suggests a
[process of **'[internalisation' has taken place such that
individuals]{.mark} are produced,** and [produce themselves, through a
**moral condemnation** of their]{.mark} immediate
[condition]{.mark}]{.underline}.  The vitality and [simple assertion of
doing and becoming are gradually replaced by **[a spirit of calculation,
self-reflection,]{.mark} resentment, and ultimately,
nihilism**]{.underline}.  [[Cut off from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
immediacy of **[[becoming we grow to resent ourselves]{.mark} and our
position in society. [We blame our limitations on others who we come to
hate,]{.mark} as we hate ourselves.]{.underline}**  This broad-brush but
potent cultural psychology, developed by Nietzsche, influenced many
thinkers -- Max Weber and Sigmund Freud are only two of the most obvious
examples.  Yet Baudrillard's relationship to this tradition of thought
has not been explored, as a result many aspects of his work are poorly
understood.  [Baudrillard's concept of the Code can be seen as a
distinctive re-working of this notion of a **system of "oppressive
narrowness" and internalisation**]{.underline}. [[The Code]{.mark} is
able to [present itself as]{.mark} a **realm of [freedom,]{.mark}**
justice and equality while **[it]{.mark} models, [defines and contrasts
'individuals' through]{.mark} their [positioning]{.mark}** on a
hierarchical scale: **[not an iron cage but a virtual
one.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign (1981)
Baudrillard began to describe various codes of meaning (or
signification) as integrated by what he called 'the code' (le code, la
grille, le Code du signes, la matrice).  By "the code" Baudrillard
intended not particular codes of meaning (English, French, Morse) or
particular modes of the interpretation of meaning (dominant, resistant,
plural) but rather the condition of possibility of all
coding.[\[1\]](http://intertheory.org/pawlett.htm#_edn1) The notion of
the Code is then a critical concept, not an empirical one.  For a
genuine [critique of]{.mark} the consumer [society]{.mark} to be made,
Baudrillard's early work suggests, we [must focus]{.mark} analysis
[on]{.mark} the form of the [Code]{.mark}, not its contents or
representations. [The Code]{.mark} as form is preconscious, or, in
Baudrillard's terminology "precessional"; that is, as grid or network
it [precedes individual experience]{.mark}, perception, choice.  [The
medium]{.mark} of this grid [is the]{.mark} abstract, arbitrary
[sign]{.mark}. [Signs]{.mark}, visual and linguistic, [are the medium of
coding,]{.mark} of [the ordered exchange between coded
elements]{.mark}.  Composed to two sets of inter-locking relations, the
sign-referent and signifier-signified, the sign is the universal form
[constructing]{.mark} the oppositions of [subject and object]{.mark}, of
real and representation, of self and other: [the building blocks of
'reality']{.mark} itself. The ordered exchange of [signs
produce]{.mark}s [identity and difference]{.mark}: every 'thing' is
semiotic; every 'thing' is a 'thing' because it is not some other
'thing'.  Baudrillard calls this the "logic of equivalence".  [Signs
produce]{.mark} social [meanings]{.mark} and values [on a scale or grid
whereby all points can be compared]{.mark}, contrasted and
exchanged.  To clarify, it is not that every 'thing' can be converted
into sign form, it rather that [the very process of]{.mark}
transcription or [coding produces]{.mark} 'things', essences,
[identities and differences]{.mark}.  Though the Code encompasses every
'thing' it cannot process ambivalence (or becoming) as these are not
'things' with identity but relations, always "in transit" or
metamorphosis. The Code then does not merely express particular aspects
of the consumer capitalist system such as media, fashion or advertising:
it is far more fundamental.  At the fundamental level [the Code]{.mark}
is what [prevents symbolic exchange]{.mark} by breaking its cycles or by
seizing and diverting its potential.  [Symbolic exchange]{.mark}, as
relation of ambivalence and becoming, is not a 'thing', it [has no
identity]{.mark} (and strictly speaking no 'definition' either) it
occurs or rather "effracts" only when the Code is annulled, reversed or
suspended.  Symbolic exchange traverses all oppositions, it is neither
one thing nor another, it prevents the emergence of fixed or stable
positions or power relations.  The most common example of symbolic
exchange is the gift.  The meaning of the act of giving a gift, in the
consumer society as much as the tribal societies interpreted by Mauss
(1990), is in no sense reducible to the object given, it depends on if
and how it is accepted.  The giving, receiving and reciprocating of
gifts are intensely volatile relations, the meaning of the gift never
settles into fixity or identity.  The meaning of the gift can be
transformed at any moment in the on-going relation between parties;
indeed this relation is of the gift and the gift is of this relation:
relation and gift flourish together, and die together.  Baudrillard was
particularly interested in the moment of the "counter-gift" (contre
don), that is the refusal of the gift or its return with interest to the
giver in a kind of status war (the latter often referred to, rather
imprecisely, as "potlatch" (1993: 125-194). Baudrillard defines [the
Code]{.mark} as [the "structural law of value]{.mark}"; a "generalised
metaphysics" [synthesising social values, social production, social
identities]{.mark}.  His early emphasis was the Code's "obligatory
registration of individuals on the scale of status" (1981: 68).  [The
Code produces]{.mark} a "hierarchy of differential signs" and,
crucially, "constitutes [the fundamental]{.mark}, decisive [form of
social control]{.mark} -- more so than acquiescence to ideological
norms" (ibid.).  It makes no difference whether we, as individuals,
endorse the consumer capitalist system or not, since we [are all
positioned by the Code]{.mark}, and are positioned through it by
others.  We all know the value of a professional career, an elite
education or a cute butt whether we like it or not.  Further each of
these ['sign-value]{.mark}s' [are]{.mark} [classifiable and
comparable]{.mark} through the sign's logic of equivalence:
traditionally wealthy businessmen trade on their financial wealth to
offset their ailing physique and secure the affections of a younger and
more physically attractive partner, that businesswomen now do the same
only demonstrates the universalisation of the Code's sign system. [The
Code]{.mark} breaks, [blocks and bars ambivalence and]{.mark} in the
barring [produces equivalence]{.mark} -- [the regulated play of]{.mark}
identity and [difference]{.mark} [characterised by oppositions such
as]{.mark} true/false, [good/evil]{.mark}, self/other, male/female.  The
standard dimensions of consumer status positioning flow from this
source: rich/poor, young/old, fat/thin, attractive/unattractive.  Binary
oppositions are central features of Baudrillard's first and second
orders of the sign (or "orders of simulacra").  The third order, of [the
Code]{.mark} proper, [simulates choice,]{.mark} difference, freedom and
diversity [by allowing the privileged term to switch]{.mark}, fuse or
"implode" (1983: 95-110).  For example 'fat', 'poor' and 'old' can be
beautiful too -- if only within the confines of fashion and cosmetics
advertising or pop music video. [The Code operates in "total
indifference" to content; everything is permitted]{.mark} in [sign
form]{.mark}, that is [as "simulation]{.mark}". In his early
studies, The Object System and The Consumer Society Baudrillard depicts
the Code as performing a pacifying effect on society; it soothes away
once clear-cut, binary divisions of class and status by registering all
people as individual consumers on a single universal scale.  Everyone
becomes a consumer, though some, of course, consume far more than
others.  As universal form [the]{.mark} status of [consumer]{.mark}
[confers a kind of democratic flattening of social relations: but an
illusory one]{.mark}.  If [class conflict was]{.mark}, to some extent,
[pacified]{.mark}, [Baudrillard]{.mark} did not contend that other forms
of violence and dissent would be deterred by the Code.  Indeed he [wrote
of the emergence of new]{.mark} "anomalous" [forms of violence]{.mark},
less intelligible, less structured, not binary but post-dialectical
(Baudrillard 1998: 174-185).  He later proposed the term "disembodied
hate" or simply "[the hate]{.mark}" to express aspects of this process
(1996: 142-147).

### Thesis -- Code (McLennan)

#### You should also forget foucault -- hes a sad signifier

**Mclennan'16** \|Mark McLennan is a graduate student at the London
School of Economics and Political Science, having completed a BA and a
JD at the University of Sydney. His main interests are in continental
philosophy, new media, and law *Simulacra and Simulated Policing:
Baudrillard and Criminology*\|KZaidi

After describing a novel sociological position that regards [[semiology,
rather than capital, as the key component of
domination]{.underline}]{.mark} (Baudrillard \[1968\] 1998),
 [Baudrillard's radical social theory emerges in light of considerations
of [consumerism, media, information and technology]{.mark}---all of
which [conspire to create]{.mark} what Baudrillard calls [a 'hyperreal'
society]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is a contemporary world
[[where all boundaries]{.mark}, categories and values [implode into the
'end of the social'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Baudrillard (1972) begins elaborating this theory in an article titled
'Design and Environment or How Political Economy Escalates into
Cyberblitz' (Baudrillard, 1972, Chapter 10). In this essay, [he points
to the importance of 'the passage out of a metallurgic into
a semiurgic society']{.underline} (Ibid.: 185). [Here, [consumer objects
take on a life of their own 'as]{.mark} an embodiment and [functional
part of a system of signs]{.mark}, independent of its status as a
commodity']{.underline} (Kellner, 1989: 76). He uses the [German
[Bauhaus movement]{.mark} as an example [to anticipate the 'universal
semantisation of the environment in which **everything becomes the
object of a calculus of function and
signification'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1972: 185-86). This
is achieved by the synthesis 'of form and function, beauty and utility,
of art and technology' in the design of objects that **[[produces a
functionalised universe whereby t]{.mark}he meaning and [function of
every object is determined by its place in the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a result, '[[the whole environment
becomes a signifier, objectified]{.mark} as an element of
signification']{.underline} (Ibid.: 186-87). This is analogous to
[Derrida's concept of 'difference' whereby meaning is never present 'in
a sufficient presence that would refer only to itself']{.underline}
(Derrida, 1965: 27). [Essentially, [objects, words and images have no
direct relationship to the things in which they refer]{.mark}, they
inherent meaning only by interacting with one another [in]{.mark} an
**ongoing system of contrast**. Baudrillard refers to this system as [a
'**cybernetic code'**]{.mark},]{.underline} and argues that [reality
itself is shut out from this system of because **the system is wholly
self-referencing. This [code creates 'a functionalised,]{.mark}
integrated and [self-reproducing universe' of meaning]{.mark},
controlled by simulacra and simulation**]{.underline}. And, like
Derrida's text, there is nothing outside of the code.

In 'The Orders of Simulacra', [Baudrillard (1995) outlines the stages of
the transition from traditional society to the contemporary society
defined by simulations]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1995). [First,
according to Baudrillard, the [feudal era had a fixed social order
established by a hierarchy of]{.mark} obligatory [signs]{.mark}
indicating social class and rank.]{.underline} [Here, a '[natural law of
value' dominates the stage]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Simulacra,]{.underline}]{.mark} [a representation of another image,
[first emerge as '**counterfeits' of the real**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For example, [representations of class, law or value are said to be
grounded in nature: art imitates life and [democracy is legitimised by
'natural rights']{.mark}]{.underline}. Baudrillard indicates, however,
that **[the [inherent goal of simulacra is to produce a
controllable]{.mark} and universal [system of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [At this stage, counterfeit simulacra is
working 'only on substance and form, not yet on relations or
structures', but **[its evolution will create 'a pacified society,
ground up into a deathless substance]{.mark} ... that will guarantee an
[eternity of ... cultural hegemony']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baudrillard,
1983b: 91).  Next, the [[second-order of simulacra appears during the
industrial revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. Importantly, [infinite
reproducibility is introduced into society]{.underline}. [For example,
exact replicas of [objects are produced by assembly lines and
automation]{.mark}. No longer is there nostalgia for a natural order;
**nature is to be dominated by production; counterfeit simulacra are now
obsolete**.]{.underline} Most importantly, however, the [infinite
[reproducibility of objects]{.mark}, augmented by the rise of
capitalism, **[enables the emergence of the cybernetic code]{.mark}**
and contemporary society.]{.underline}

Baudrillard claims that '[[we are in the third-order simulacra', where
simulation models come to constitute the world]{.mark} and all
referential finalities are abolished]{.underline} (Ibid.: 100-01): God,
Man, Nature, History, Society and others. This is because **[[images are
only understood by reference to other images]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Thus, [society has moved from 'a capitalist-productivitist society to a
neo-capitalist cybernetic order']{.underline} (Ibid.: 111). As a
[[result of this]{.mark} code, [images no longer refer to an
object]{.mark}; rather, they refer to another commutable image on the
code]{.underline}. But, [through models contained in common societal
narrative and institutional discourse, [simulations are able to produce
a 'reality effect',]{.mark} which [conceals the fact they are]{.mark}
merely refe[rring to other simulations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bogard,
1996: 10). For example, **[[the code]{.mark} continually [sets up
simulations of events, which test individuals and '\[inscribe\]
them]{.mark} into the simulated order' through a '[process of
signalisation']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kellner, 1989: 80). For example,
[[every advertisement, choice of commodity, choice of entertainment, and
political candidate presents a chance for a binary response of
affirmation or negation. It is in this way that individuals are inserted
into a dominating 'coded system of similarities and
dissimilarities]{.mark}, of identities and programed
differences']{.underline} (Ibid.). [Thus, Baudrillard's contemporary
social theory is distinguishable from previous determinist social
theories that postulate powerful individuals, classes, or corporations
manipulating the public for certain ends. Instead, Baudrillard suggests
that **so[cial organisation is determined by individual's responses to
the pre-coded messages]{.mark}** that are derived from simulations of
economics, politics, culture or the banal decisions of everyday
life]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1983b: 111). Importantly for the
third-order of simulacra, **[the [binary system]{.mark} of the code
[creates a 'deterrence model']{.mark} in which [all 'radical change is
ruled out]{.mark}, since the very fact of an option between different
political parties, \[for example\], acts as a deterrent against demands
for radical social change']{.underline}** (Kellner, 1989: 81). This is
the end of society as traditionally theorised.

In Symbolic Exchange and Death [Baudrillard (1983c: 20) announces the
end of traditional conceptions of society]{.underline}---the end of
'labour, production, political economy', [and the '[dialectic
signifier/signified that permeated the accumulation of knowledge and of
meaning']{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2002: 127). Baudrillard
argues that **[[we are in a new era where media and the consumption of
semiotic codes]{.mark} that inform images, [have replaced production and
political economy as the organising foundation of
society]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, [[labour is]{.mark} now [a
'sign among signs']{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1995b: 23), [a
symbol of one's status and integration]{.underline}: 'the choice of
occupation, [the utopia of an occupation custom-made for everyone ...
labour power is no longer violently bought and sold; **[it is
designed]{.mark}, it is [marketed,]{.mark} it is
[merchandised]{.mark}**. Production thus joins the consumerist system of
signs']{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2002: 134). Because social reality is
constituted by the 'chess pieces' of the signs and symbols that are
mobilised through the media, **[nothing is objectively determined and
[everything can be simulated]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kellner, 1989: 62).
**[Thus, political economy is no longer the determinant that can explain
social phenomena.]{.underline}**

#### Trumpire

**Villanova'17** \|Michael Villanova is an undergraduate student at the
City College of New York currently studying philosophy and history. His
writings are influenced by continental social and cultural philosophy,
particularly the thoughts of Baudrillard, Zizek, and Camus. He is
currently focusing his attention on studying the effect of postmodern

Times", International Journal of Baudrillard Studies Vol 14 Number 1.
July 2017\|KZaidi

[[Trump\'s existence]{.underline}]{.mark} and rise in popularity [is not
only predictable but [seemingly has no limit]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
certainly an ideological event at some level, [Trump\'s existence is
[proof of the postmodern condition of politics]{.mark}, culture, and
society]{.underline}. For **[Trump is also [the embodiment of the
banality of politics today. He does not need ideology to pin him
down]{.mark} in any sense. [He can take opposing positions]{.mark} and
believe in both of them. He can insult someone and call them his friend.
He can claim it is obvious he is winning and yet be shocked at his own
performance. [Trump]{.mark}, in this way, [is beyond
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [He has breached the realm of
appearances and molded appearance and reality into one.]{.underline}
**[No longer do people need to look elsewhere for their identity but
rather focus on Trump,]{.underline}** forgetting all their economic and
social troubles, and **[[allowing his existence to create their
reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Trump is beyond politics because [he is
a reality show]{.mark}, and thus has transformed politics by making
appearance not a farcical act, but one which others perceive as a
conscious act.]{.underline} This, combined with his inability to pin
down what he truly believes, [proves to the people that [he is]{.mark} a
sort of [aesthetic sublime object]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the
strictest Kantian sense **[he is this [object that once gazed upon,
becomes transcendental]{.mark}]{.underline}**. How do youdescribe Trump?
When he doesn\'t even believe what he says and fully embraces the media
circus, [he is untouchable. He is an object [outside of scrutiny]{.mark}
and because of the object\'s indescribable and mysterious nature, it
strikes fear in us.]{.underline} If we knew what Trump\'s actual
intentions were we would be calm, and thus the sublime nature of his
image would be gone. Yet, [the image continually deceives us and we
continue gazing upon the figure of Trump.]{.underline}

In this very sense [[Trump has been]{.mark} able to kill the political
**by fully [embracing transaesthetics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Baurillard
writes: "\...what has occurred is a **[[materialization of aesthetics
everywhere under an operational form]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(Baudrillard, 2009:18). [Due to this, art has made the **very quilting
point of reality** disappear. [The more art we create to simulate our
reality the more the Real disappears]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[This is
the [very operational form]{.mark} which Trump has mastered because,
like the conditions where great art is made, it comes
naturally.]{.underline}** [He exists]{.underline} originally **[outside
politics as a figure whose life was merely a show to begin
with]{.underline}**. As Baurillard points out, [[aesthetics creates the
spectacle of nothingness]{.underline}]{.mark}, and **[in opposition to
nothing, [mirrors perfection]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard
1986:77). [We gather around to marvel at the impenetrable form of
Trump\'s (non)existence]{.underline}. What is happening, for the most
part, is [a new experience for most people]{.underline}. [We are used to
the spectacle and even any person in America today can recite some pap
about the "untrustworthy" media.]{.underline} But what the **[[populous
is unaware of is the combination of the spectacle as an aesthetic
event]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So the **[[passionate observer is left
chasing the ethereal form of Trump, unable to pinpoint the
quality]{.mark} and the enjoyment level factor [which drives them to
understand]{.mark} the amazing being of Trump.]{.underline}** He has no
true political intentions he has [only aesthetic qualities and
characteristics.]{.underline}

Thus a main question remains: [How did Trump, as an art piece, come to
exist]{.underline}. [The answer is one which fuses Hegelian and
postmodern theory]{.underline}. **[Trump exists as the actualization and
fullest force of a sublation of a sublation]{.underline}**. He
**[seemingly always exists in our memories; he was always-already a
figure of authority.]{.underline}** But [this surely cannot be the case
and therefore we are puzzled and from this the **[enigmatic figure of
Trump becomes more mysterious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [level of
difference between existence and non-existence in Trump is]{.underline}
what Slavoj Zizek identifies as: "[The final moment of the dialectical
process, the \'sublation of the difference\', does not consist in the
act of its sublation, but in the experience of how the difference was
always-already sublated; of how, in a away it never effectively
existed]{.underline}" (Zizek, 2008:62). Thus it **[does not seriously
matter how Trump\'s rise occurred or if in retrospect he was always a
figure and we are now deceived by his image]{.underline}**. The
[negative space of difference in aesthetic Trump creates a "retroactive
unmasking]{.underline}" as Zizek says, and [**[we are now forever stuck
with the image Trump wants to present to us]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In
understanding his origins **[[he reaches new heights of influence as a
figure]{.mark} that, as Hegel points out, permeates our air like a
perfume]{.underline}**. Consciously and unconsciously [he is an [object
which has created our current world]{.mark}.]{.underline} He now
[sculpts our language, our ideology, our talks, our jokes, and
ontologically smashes the political "left-right" spectrum]{.underline}.
At an ideological level however **[Trump\'s rise is more
obvious]{.underline}**. [Trump still takes the form of a "sublation of a
sublation" as he was able to capture the libidinal anger and enjoyment
of the Tea Party and capture it.]{.underline} The Tea Party was an
attempted sublation by creating a movement against the "establishment"
and its order. [Once its members were elected into the official
positions with power the Tea Party effectively disappeared because its
own members could not]{.underline}, for obvious reasons, [change
politics]{.underline}. **[Those elected under the [Tea Party
banner]{.mark} thus [became consumed by the game of politics]{.mark},
but the people they had influenced, promising them an era reminiscent of
1776, remained.]{.underline}** Thus [the same people disaffected by the
political process, still engaged at an enjoyment level, looked for a
figure truly outside the political sphere]{.underline}. This is why Ted
Cruz and Marco Rubio, elected with the Tea Party wave, crashed. [Trump
had captured their "anti-establishment" following, and thus with the
sublation of the original sublation complete, Cruz and Rubio were
always-already establishment]{.underline}. **[Trump will have won no
matter what happens. If the realm of the politics reverts back to a form
of appearances and semblances, it will not matter. In our idioms, in our
textbooks, and in our thoughts [Trump\'s origins will always
remain]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Thus without concrete origins we find ourselves without expectations.
The level of expectations is so incredibly low that we find ourselves
surprised at the simplest of his actions]{.underline}. **[His ability
not to say inflammatory statements is a sort of homage to politics, a
remembrance of when politics was pure appearances]{.underline}**. It is
the [very moments when he does not say racist and xenophobic things, we
become surprised]{.underline}. Is this the same man? Maybe there is
something actually there? **[[His image, even more enigmatic, breaches a
further ideological step]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is the "cynical"
side of ideology that Zizek identifies and the side of ideology in which
someone else does the act of believing for us. [In this case a closed
loop is formed as Trump does the believing for us.]{.underline}
Baurillard writes: "**[[Our images are like icons: they allow us to go
on believing in art while eluding the question of its
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**"(Baudrillard, 2009:19). **[He believes
in his own views, whatever they are. Our [confusion with his
contradictory attitudes and statements leaves the public
befuddled]{.mark} while he can continue, unbeknownst to us, to reproduce
his image. We go on evading the real question of why Trump exists or
where he came from. Instead [we find ourselves stricken by the
iconography]{.mark}, captured tight within its gaze, and thus [allowing
us to continue the spectacle]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

only [modern day incarnations of transparency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
open government, freedom of speech, and an understanding of the press as
fourth estate, **[but also identity politics]{.underline}**. Distinct
from a form of top-down visibility akin to surveillance and control,
Andreas **[Brighenti aligns [progressive visibility with "recognition":
"a form of social visibility, with]{.mark} crucial [consequences]{.mark}
on the relation between minority groups and the
mainstream]{.underline}**" (2007, p. 329). **[[Visibility announces the
self and the collective as having to be seen in a way that recognizes
the humanity of the subject]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The emphasis on
visibility as a political strategy is wholly understandable, given a
history of marginalization and erasure, and nothing I want to say
hereafter should be read as a dismissal of that very important attempt
to dislodge the complicity between whiteness/heterosexuality/masculinity
and public legitimacy. **[However, [finding voice, claiming the right to
be heard]{.mark} and seen, to "come out," perhaps, has today achieved
such a level of ubiquity that it now extends to everyone---even those
historically granted visibility anyway.]{.underline}** The [visibility,
self-tracking, and confession that characterizes the use and experience
of social media and popular culture today means that being seen and
heard [is less a corrective force within a stratified culture, and more
a measure of social and entrepreneurial success]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[Visibility has]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[arguably [been hijacked by

communication [are]{.mark} increasingly [mediated through]{.mark}
technologies of [digital consumer surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(whether we are talking about social media platforms like Facebook or
search engines like Google).

I am by no means the first to have questioned the hope put into both
visibility and revelation as progenitors of political change. Slavov
Žižek, drawing on Peter Sloterdjik, wants to understand why **[people
still act as if they do not see through ideological falsehoods when
demystification is in abundance]{.underline}**: "\[[O\]ne knows the
falsehood very well, one is well aware of a particular interest hidden
behind an ideological universality, but still one does not renounce
it"]{.underline} (1989, p. 29). **[[Revelation]{.mark} qua
class/race/gender consciousness [does not lead to
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}** He concludes that "**[[cynical
reason]{.mark}, with all its ironic detachment, [leaves untouched the
fundamental level of ideological fantasy]{.mark}, the [level on which
ideology structures the social reality itself]{.mark}" (1989, p. 30).
The problem with revelation for Jean Baudrillard is similar. He worries
that [revelation]{.mark} of a scandal]{.underline}** (his well-known
example is Watergate) merely **[[serves to regenerate and restore faith
in the inherently scandalous system]{.mark} and logic of capitalist
democracy]{.underline}**. Woodward and Bernstein, in Baudrillard's view,
merely regenerated "public morality (by indignation, denunciation,
etc.)," and therefore "spontaneously further\[ed\] the order of capital"
(1983 p. 27).

Other, [perhaps less pessimistic commentators, emphasize the action that
must follow on the heels of revelation to enable a political
intervention]{.underline}. Alasdair [Roberts argues, "The significance
of Abu Ghraib may . . . lie in the extent to which we overestimated the
catalytic effect of exposure]{.underline}" (2006, p. 238). [For him,
democracy has to involve the responsibility of the public to act upon
the information to which it apparently has a right. **Jodi Dean also
airs frustration with revelation and visibility:**]{.underline} "**[All
sorts of [horrible political processes are perfectly transparent today.
The problem is that people . . . are so enthralled to transparency that
they have lost the will to fight]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (2002, p. 174).

She [calls for "decisive action" to interrupt the depoliticizing flow of
messages. Rather than constituting a lasting intervention in a
"distribution of the sensible"]{.underline} as Jacques Rancière (2004)
would have it, **[referring to a politics of that which is visible,
audible, sayable, and knowable at any moment, these writers point toward
the way in which [revelations often become subsumed by "communicative
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**": "the **[[circulation of
content]{.mark} in the dense, intensive networks of global
communications" that "[relieves top-level actors]{.mark}
(]{.underline}**corporate, institutional and governmental) **[[from the

According to Dean, [actors "hope that sufficient volume]{.underline}
(whether in terms of [number of contributions or the spectacular nature
of a contribution) will give their contributions dominance or
stickiness]{.underline}" (2005, p. 53). The **[proliferation of
positions is damaging because it "[hinders the formation of strong
counterhegemonies]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (2005, p. 53). **[Ultimately,

[When a [linear spacetime epistemology
begins]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} as many Black diasporic
epistemologies do, [[with object status---being enslaved]{.mark},
colonized, relocated, and so on---the [laws of cause and effect make it
difficult to reverse the binary]{.mark} that is set in
place]{.underline}, because [oppr[ession is asserted as the cause of all
historical events]{.underline}]{.mark} [(effects) [in the
timeline]{.mark}, excepting those events that are caused by a Black
(resistant) reaction to an oppressor's action.]{.underline} Yet because
it is a reaction to an action, [we are again returned to a weird and
dismally fixed racing of this Black physics, in which [white- ness
always retains the originary agency]{.mark} and, because [origins
dominate a linear narrative, white]{.mark} racism [is always the central
actor]{.mark} in Black lives now condemned to the status of
reactors.]{.underline}

[If, however, we add [Epiphenomenal time]{.mark} to our interpellation
here, the "[now" is foregrounded by agency because Blackness begins as
its own interpellation in the moment]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same
time, [this [moment is nuanced because it involves a]{.mark} potentially
[endless set of negotiations]{.mark}. Instead of the Black Subject being
moved down a line through cause and effect as in a strictly linear
interpellation]{.underline}, the [[Subject in the moment is variously
informed by a variety of external and internal
stimuli]{.underline}]{.mark} (what is witnessed and what happens; what
is thought and felt) that also can in[tersect with one
another.]{.underline} For example, I might watch an episode of a
television show in one moment and laugh uproariously at what I find to
be a daring but insightful joke about racism; in another moment,
[watching the same show and hearing the same joke, I might well have
forgotten my previous reaction]{.underline} (or remember it, in whatever
valence) an[d find myself ambivalent about or o ended by the joke. In
other words, I do not move through the world reacting in the same way to
the same stimuli all the time]{.underline}---and per- haps [this is
because the [stimuli are never the same]{.mark} because if not the space
then the time has shifted (]{.underline}even if I am watching from my
same place on the couch, I am doing so on different days).

This is [both [liberating and problematic to our lives,]{.mark} in which
intellectual and behavioral [consistency is more highly valued than its
less predictable]{.mark} [performances]{.mark}]{.underline}. It means
that [one does not always behave as one wishes, and for the Black
Subject who seeks to adhere to a Middle Passage interpellation, the
clarity of this linear timeline is often belied by the familiar
complexity of lived moments]{.underline}. Similarly, the last paragraph
of "Everybody's Protest Novel" asserts agency as an ambivalent
possession, but a possession nonetheless: "Our humanity is our burden,
our life; we need not battle for it; we need only to do what is
infinitely more di cult---that is, accept it."8

#### The subject cannot be liberated from the system because the subject is the system itself -- they collude with the system at the level of form

**McLennan, 17** \[Mark McLennan, PhD Student and Master of Laws at the
London School of Economics, "On The Debate That Didn't Take Place,"
International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 14, Number 1\]

**[This Foucaultian [resistance lends itself to the]{.mark} type of
identity [politics that dominate progressive activism]{.mark} of
contemporary society]{.underline}**. [Commendable though their
super-structural achievements may have been, [this is far from]{.mark} a
[revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [a closer reading of
Foucault's improbable plurality of resistance suggests that spaces
within the system may open up, and can be linked with other
movements]{.underline}. For Foucault, the 'strategic codification of
these points' can lead to 'radical ruptures'(Foucault, 1978:95-96).
**[But still, [underlying this]{.mark} more modest conception of
[resistance is the production of]{.mark} novel [discourse]{.mark},
knowledge, [and subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Here lies the
problem: when a new subjectivity is produced, from which knowledge does
it appropriate its novel characteristics? **[Is this]{.mark} novelty
[not merely a (re)combination of]{.mark} the constituent elements of
[previously oppressive discourse?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Foucault,
appears to concede this, noting that 'we cannot jump outside the
situation', and that 'resistance is never in a position of exteriority
in relation to power'(1997: 167; 1978: 95). Therefore, [I would conclude
that, subjects are locked within a network of knowledge and power,
forever pre-determining the status of any attempts at
liberation]{.underline}. Progressive commentator Jerome E. Roos, in an
article entitled 'Foucault and the Revolutionary Self-Castration of the
Left', sums this up succinctly: Because it connects power with knowledge
through discourse, and because it posits that knowledge and power are
continually reproduced through both formal and informal institutions,
**[[there is]{.mark} ultimately [no way for]{.mark} willful [agents to
escape]{.mark} the choking grasp of [their culture without reproducing
the same]{.mark} forms of [oppression they]{.mark} are [try]{.mark}ing
[to overcome]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2011). II. The Productive
Emancipators After elaborating a theory whereby individuals in an object
centred society are dominated by a semiotic code, reproduced by acts of
consumption, Baudrillard moved into a polemical phase (1975;2007;1991).
Considered by many to be a break from Marxism,
[Baudrillard]{.underline}'s The Mirror of Production (1975), [should
instead be considered a break-through for critical theory]{.underline}.
In it, [he shatters the promise of Marx's theory, yet the phantasm of
revolutionary challenge would haunt Baudrillard's subsequent
output]{.underline}. His patricide begins in the preface, where
**[Baudrillard laments the fact that [critical thought sustains]{.mark}
'an unbridled romanticism of [productivity]{.mark}']{.underline}**(1975:
18). His insight here is that **[[because]{.mark} the concept of
['production' underpins]{.mark} both [the]{.mark} current [political
economy and that which attempts to challenge it]{.mark}, such 'a
consensus is suspect']{.underline}**(Ibid.). **[Ultimately for
Baudrillard, [Marx]{.mark} only [critiqued the content of production,
and left intact the form]{.mark} of production.]{.underline}** Thus,
**[Marxist thought can only rearrange the contents of society's economic
infrastructure: any alternative becomes the mirror of
capitalism]{.underline}**, as **[[it is]{.mark} fundamentally [unable to
alter a political economy based on the]{.mark} accumulation of objects
and their [network of signs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In order to
radically critique the political economy, [production itself must be
considered. That individuals must produce knowledge]{.mark}, objects, or
history to satisfy their 'needs' [is a metaphor created by
capital]{.mark} in order to naturalise itself]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[this idea is for Baudrillard 'a fable of political economy retold to
generations of revolutionaries infected even in their political
radicalism by the conceptual viruses of this same political
economy']{.underline}**(Baudrillard, 1975:22). He insists that [any
authentic needs (use-value) are the 'horizon of exchange value',
potentially non-existent, but **even at best
inaccessible**]{.underline}. He goes on to argue that [use-value or
externalities are 'only concepts produced and projected into a generic
dimension by the development of the very system of exchange
value']{.underline}(Ibid.,30). Thus **[[there is no]{.mark} objective
[referent to which]{.mark} radical [critique can ground
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the [concepts]{.mark} that
Marxism deploys [are predetermined by the]{.mark} existent [political
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Looking back to Foucaultian
resistance, and its reliance on production, Baudrillard's analysis is
applicable as well]{.underline}**. So, **[in relation to Foucault's
resistance, or Hardt and Negri's liberated subject, [the conception
of]{.mark} an authentic or [liberated subjectivity]{.mark} is the most
internalized expression of domination because it [encloses the
individual in the system's logic]{.mark} of production. The total
domination of capital culminates in the Foucaultian evidence of
individuals as producers of their own novel subjectivity.]{.underline}**
Based on the above, **[novel subjectivity or [productive resistance
cannot exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Baudrillard makes clear, [these
transcendental concepts are generated by the system of generalised
exchange]{.underline}. **[[Productivity must no longer be
considered]{.mark} a [neutral]{.mark} enterprise, which can be
redeployed for liberatory ends]{.underline}**. For example,
**[Foucault's system of [knowledge power]{.mark} does not only create
the subject through the production of knowledge, it [relies on
the]{.mark} very [conception that production is a]{.mark} 'fundamental
[human potential']{.mark}]{.underline}**(Baudrillard, 1975:30). Indeed,
Baudrillard might even say something like: **[More deeply than the
fiction of an individual creating their own identity, the system is
rooted in the identification of the individual with their ability to
produce knowledge and therefore 'transform society according to
human(ist) ends']{.underline}**(Ibid., 31). For Baudrillard,
**[[individuals are]{.mark} thus '[metaphysically over-determined as a
producer']{.mark} continuously acting in accordance within the rules of
the political economy]{.underline}**. It is here that, **[like Marxists,
Foucaultian's 'assist the cunning' of the system that dominates them:
Convinced that they are dominated by knowledge-power, they fail to
consider the 'more radical hypothesis' that [all counter-knowledge, at
the level of form, is the same]{.mark} thing. Novel subjectivity is
novel domination. [Differentiating subjectivities fails to]{.mark}
challenge the real determinant of domination: [production.]{.mark}
Risably, Foucault's theory attempts to resist global capital 'by using
as an analytic instrument the most subtle ideological phantasm that
capital has ever elaborated']{.underline}**(Ibid.:33). Having analysed
Baudrillard's criticism of critical theory, it is now possible to look
at his direct challenge to Foucault. III. The Order of Things In 1977's
Forget Foucault, [Baudrillard argues that **[Foucault's 'theoretical
production]{.mark}, like material production [loses]{.mark} its
[determinacy]{.mark} and begins to turn around on itself,
[slipping]{.mark} en abyme [towards a reality that cannot be
found]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark}(Baudrillard, 2007:44). That is,
**[like Marxism, Foucault's theory lacks an objective referent, and is
unable to challenge the system it describes]{.underline}**. **[Worse
still[, it is another 'mirror of production]{.mark}]{.underline}**.' For
Baudrillard, '**[the original sense of "production" is not in fact that
of material manufacture rather, it means to render visible, to cause to
appear and be made to reappear']{.underline}**(Ibid.,37). Sarcastically
Baudrillard says, 'Let everything be produced, be read, become real,
visible, and marked with the sign of effectiveness'(Ibid.). So, '**[let
everything be transcribed into force relations, into conceptual systems
or into calculable energy; [let everything be said, gathered, indexed
and registered:]{.mark} this is how sex appears in pornography, but this
is more generally the project of our whole culture, whose natural
condition is "obscenity]{.underline}**"'(Ibid. 1). Baudrillard is
arguing that **[the effect of [Foucault's obscene project]{.mark} is to
contribute to the increasing simulation of the world, [render]{.mark}ing
[it]{.mark} all [too knowable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Simulation]{.underline}, for Baudrillard **[involves the systematic
production of signs that come to constitute what we conceive of as
'reality]{.underline}**.' [This process displaces the real, by putting
'the illusion of death of the world to death', and replacing it with 'an
absolutely real world']{.underline}(Baudrillard, 1996:16).
**[[Foucault]{.mark} himself might best exemplify the banality of an
all-too-real phenomenon: As a result of his ubiquity in virtually every
university syllabus, his range of thought [has been reduced to a set of
slogans and catchwords]{.mark} so omnipresent that close readings of his
work are rare]{.underline}**. According to Baudrillard, **[because they
are productive, Foucault's descriptions of power and knowledge are
'currently obliterating the traces of our existence, spiriting away the
evidence for our sensible world]{.underline}**'(Ibid.,22). **[[As
Foucault]{.mark} produces discourse on power and his disciples [argue
for]{.mark} the creation of [new]{.mark} 'authentic' (realer than real)
identities, knowledge and [subjectivities, the world is pushed]{.mark}
further [towards a fractal stage of liquidated
referential]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. **[This is a trans-theoretical
epoch, where capital is intermingled with its other]{.underline}**.
[Negation becomes affirmation through the integration of
novelty]{.underline}. **[Seen this way, Foucault's conception of power
is capital's alibi as [it does not challenge the system;]{.mark} rather,
[it advances it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For Baudrillard, **[capital is
'the one entity to which our entire system \[of simulation\] is
tethered']{.underline}**(Coulter, 2010:1). Indeed, in his early work,
[Baudrillard analysed the ways in which capitalism began to reorganise
the overdeveloped world into a society of consumption, through the
emancipation of signs]{.underline}. In the 'first order of simulacra',
sixteenth and seventeenth century bourgeois culture dismantled the
'fixed ranks and restricted exchanges of the feudal order' (Pawlett,
2007:165). This introduced a novel 'competition at the level of signs'
within society. Here, the meaning of signs was not tied to a single
referent such as birth, and identity and subjectivity were no longer
concrete. Then, with the dawn of the serial production of objects,
capital enabled a transition into the 'second order of simulacra.' Here,
a general equivalent of signs is born within market relations, and the
serial reproduction of objects. This extinguishes an original sign
referent and with it any symbolic obligation. Thus, subjectivity and
power is represented through institutions and practices such as
labour---Foucault's disciplinary society. But, this second-order is
transient, because 'serial production gives way to generation through
models ...'(Baudrillard, 1993:56). The serial reproduction of objects,
for Baudrillard, quickly enables that which is produced, to begin to be
conceived 'according to their reproducibility' as a cybernetic code
(Ibid.). This immediately enables the third order of simulacra to
emerge, wherein 'everything changes with the device of
simulation'(Baudrillard, 1983:21). Consider this third order 'the work
of reality in the age of its technological over-producibility'(Benjamin,
2008:53). In the 'third order of simulacra', **[society is governed by a
'structural law of value' whereby an operative semiotic code and a set
of simulacral models dominate subjects]{.underline}**. [It is precisely
this code that infects society at the molecular level, as a kind of
capitalist determined DNA]{.underline}. **[[Operating at]{.mark} this
[infinitesimal level, through]{.mark} the [exchange of signs, capital is
exchanged at]{.mark} an [accelerated speed]{.mark}, flowing throughout
all discourse, and reproducing its social relations by way of
models]{.underline}**. Baudrillard is clear about this: '[simulacra do
not consist only the play of signs, they involve social relations and
social power']{.underline}(Baudrillard, 1993:52). In this third order,
**[[the system speeds toward]{.mark}s a '[perfected']{.mark} degree of
[control through 'prediction,]{.mark} simulation, programmed
anticipation and indeterminate mutation'(]{.underline}**Ibid.,60). Here,
**[the [production of anything]{.mark}---be it objects or
subjectivity---[becomes integrated in]{.mark}to [the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Crucially, for Baudrillard, '[the
fundamental law of this society is not the law of exploitation, but the
code of normality']{.underline}(Ibid., 29). **[This system creates
participatory subjects who actively exchange the signs gifted by the
system of sign exchange. Importantly, the system is indifferent to the
content of these models]{.underline}**. As such, **[[models of]{.mark}
negativity and [resistance can be exchanged]{.mark} freely,
[without]{.mark} negative [consequence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is
analogous, albeit at a higher level of abstraction, to the equally dour
Theodor Adorno's thoughts on 1960's protest music---where 'attempts to
outfit \[consumption\] with a new function remain equally
superficial'(Adorno, 2014; Adorno, n.d.). [In Baudrillard's simulated
society, identity is formed through the amalgamation and play of signs,
which are given by the system]{.underline}. And so, **[[the
subject]{.mark} created by the system [cannot liberate itself from the
system, because they are of the system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[by producing a theory of resistance to power that advocates more
production, [Foucault]{.mark} and his Dylan-esque disciples unwittingly
[replicate this form of]{.mark} contemporary [capitalism]{.mark},
further accelerating the system of simulation]{.underline}**. **[[Novel
subjectivity, is]{.mark} a [novel]{.mark} model of
[consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Baudrillard notes: **[This
compulsion toward liquidity, flow, and an [accelerated
circulation]{.mark} of what is psychic, sexual, or pertaining to the
body [is the]{.mark} exact [replica of the force which rules market
value: capital must circulate]{.mark}; gravity and any fixed point must
disappear; the chain of investments and reinvestments must never stop;
value must radiate endlessly in every direction]{.underline}**
(2007:39-40). So, if one accepts Baudrillard's semiotic analysis, then
it is worth reversing Foucault's infamous remark against Marx from The
Order of Things. That is, [Foucaultism exists in twentieth-century
thought like a fish in water; it's unable to breathe anywhere
else]{.underline} (Foucault, 1966:262).

#### The constant attempt to pre-empt and end conflict before it starts is going to fail and creates the reality beyond reality. Everything has happened before it happens; nuclear war is not a possibility because it has been mapped out into the system already. Our preemption and deterrence of nuclear war, Ks, terrorism, good arguments, and war create the silent danger hidden by pseudo-reality of fiat.

power and deterrence" Posted on Friday, June 8, 2012 By Andrew Robinson

[[Simulation is]{.mark} also [associated with]{.mark} a process
Baudrillard terms *[deterrence]{.mark}*]{.underline}. This term is a
play on nuclear deterrence between the superpowers (before 1991), which
Baudrillard saw as a telling case of deterrence in general, [[a
simulated conflict which exists to preclude a real clash]{.mark},
[a]{.mark} form of [manipulation]{.mark} [rather than
destruction]{.mark}. [Deterrence]{.mark} is not so much a power relation
as a mindset. It [holds people in check by making them feel
powerless]{.mark}, disappointed, [neutralised]{.mark} --
deterred.]{.underline} [When it is strong enough, it no longer needs
violent repression or war -- [it precludes conflict in
advance]{.mark}.]{.underline} In nuclear deterrence for instance, life
is reduced to survival and conflicts become pointless, as they can't
reach the ultimate stakes. Simulation feigns reality and thereby deters
or prevents reality. But this feigned reality is not entirely unreal,
because it produces effects of reality -- it is like a faked illness
which produces real symptoms. [[Think]{.mark} for instance [of
punishments applied in response to acts]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [they're
neither an objectively real consequence, since they're invented, nor an
imagined consequence]{.underline}]{.mark}[, since they actually happen.
[They're a simulated consequence, an artificially created
hyper-reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to Baudrillard, there is
no true reality against which simulation can be compared. It is
therefore more subversive of reality than a simple appearance or
falsehood. [[It controls people in a different way -- through
persuasion]{.mark} or modelling]{.underline}. Instead of demanding that
people submit to a prior model or norm, it interpellates people as
*already* being the model or the majority[. [It]{.mark} thereby
[destroys the distance between the self and the norm]{.mark}, [making
transgression more difficult.]{.mark} It creates a doubled self from
which it is hard to extract oneself.]{.underline} The question "from
where do you speak, how do you know?" is silenced by the response, "but
it is from your position that I speak". Everything appears to come from
and return to the people. The doubled self is portrayed and displayed in
forms such as CCTV images, without a gap between representation and what
is represented. This same doubling happens across different spheres --
the model is truer than the true, fashion is more beautiful than the
beautiful, hyperreality is more real than the real, and so on. The
effect of excess comes from the lack of depth (of the imaginary, but
also perhaps of relations and of context). Doubles are inherently
fascinating. They're very different from the seduction of effective
images and illusions, such as *trompe l'oeil* (a type of art which can
be mistaken for a real object). The double allows a kind of manipulation
or blackmail in which the system takes hostage a part of the self --
affect, desire, a secret -- and uses it for control. Baudrillard thinks
we are stalked by our doubles, like in the film The Student of Prague.
Yet doubles are also insufficient. People don't like being 'verified'
and predicted in advance. People prefer ideas of destiny to random
probability. Deterrence is a barrier between ourselves and our drive for
the symbolic. [[Deterrence]{.mark} also [has an effect of deterring
thought]{.mark}, of 'mental deterrence'. [It discourages people from
thinking critically]{.mark}, hence [feeding unreality.]{.mark}
[Disempowerment]{.mark} [feeds into this deterrence of thought,]{.mark}
as do the media, and the promotion of superficial sociality. [At the
same time, the system also creates a k]{.mark}ind of
[generalised]{.mark} social lockdown or universal [security
 system]{.mark}. This 'lockup and control system' is [designed to
prevent any real event from happening]{.mark}. [This system]{.mark},
based on norms, [replaces]{.mark} older [systems of violence,]{.mark}
[war and law]{.mark}, [creating a social desert]{.mark} around itself.
[It tries to pre-plan everything]{.mark}, [to leave nothing to]{.mark}
contingencies or [chance]{.mark}. It tries [to make everything
manageable through statistics and predetermined responses]{.mark}. [The
system tries to prevent accidental death through systematic, organised
death.]{.mark}]{.underline} For Baudrillard, this is the culmination of
years of civilising process and socialisation. It is the culmination of
the evolution of the dominant system. The failure of progressive
teleologies has occurred because powers to lock- down and control have
increased faster than powers to emancipate. The result is a kind of
generalised  nihilism. [[Deterrence induces general
mobilisation]{.mark}, pacification and dissuasion -- [a death or
incorporation of active energies]{.mark}. [The state dreams of
dissuading]{.mark} and annihilating [all terrorism
pre-emptively]{.mark}, [through a generalised terror on every
level.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is the price of the security of which
people now dream, as Baudrillard already observed in 1983 -- eighteen
years before the state's dream was realised. [[Overt]{.mark} and
selective r[epression transmutes over time into generalised preventive
repression]{.mark}. For instance, [the police]{.mark} according to
Baudrillard [do not reduce violence --]{.mark} [they]{.mark} simply
[take it over from crime and and become even more dangerous.]{.mark} The
code deters every real process by means of its operational double. For
instance, [it]{.mark} [prevents real revolutions]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
means of [simulated revolutions]{.mark}, real [wars by]{.mark} means of
[simulated wars]{.mark}, and so on. [This leaves no space for the real
to unfold of its own accord or for events to
happen]{.mark}.]{.underline} Baudrillard thinks prisons and death are
being replaced by a more subtle regime of control based on therapy,
reform and normalisation. The right and left are now represented mainly
by the split between direct repression and indirect pacification.
Baudrillard sees these options corresponding to the early, violent phase
of capitalism, with its emphasis on conscious psychology and
responsibility, and its more advanced, 'neo-capitalist' form, which
draws on psychoanalysis and offers tolerance and reform. A therapeutic
model of society, promoted by advertisers, politicians and modern
experts, actually covers up real conflicts and contradictions. It seeks
to solve social problems by re-injecting simulations such as controlled
smiles and regulated communication. [He also refers to a regime of
social control [through security and safety]{.mark},
[blackmail]{.mark}ing [people into conformity with]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark} [of]{.mark} their own [death]{.mark}. He sees this as
[surrounding people with a sarcophagus to prevent them from dying --
a]{.mark} kind [of living death]{.mark}. [Deterrence functions by an
anxiety to act because action brings about massive destruction. Nuclear
states can't go to war because of mutually assured destruction. Workers
won't strike because the entire economy would be shut
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Small powers which get nuclear weapons
actually buy into their own deterrence. Memory of the Holocaust is
neutralised by its constant repetition on television. While this shuts
down resistance, it also makes the system's power unusable. Power
becomes frozen and self- deterred. It creates a 'protective zone' of
'maximum security' which radiates through the territory held by the
system. It is a kind of 'glacis', a zone where any assailant is
constantly under fire from the system's defenders. In a simulated world,
events are prevented because no social logic or story can be deployed
according to its own logic. A social force risks annihilation if it
tries this. This leads to an evacuation of any historical stake from
society. We are now living through the death pangs of strong
referentials, including of the sense of being in the march of history or
in hope/at risk of a pending revolution. It might actually be better to
think of it as incapacitation rather than deterrence. [[People]{.mark}
[become]{.mark} [unable]{.mark} or afraid [to act because the capacity
to fight]{.mark} and win [has been taken away]{.mark}. This means that
[everything is neutralised]{.mark}, and reinscribed [in]{.mark} the
system. [This 'absolute model of security']{.mark} is according to
Baudrillard elaborated from nuclear war]{.underline}. The nuclear battle
station is the point from which the model of deterrence radiates out
through social life.

#### there is a recrimination DA as the attempt to redeem all history merely re-sutures the coherence of an empowered humanitarian cogito bent on humanitarian salvation.

**Baudrillard '3** /Jean, Fragments, 106-111/

On the necessity of Evil and Hell There is no longer any irrevocable
damnation today. There is no longer any hell. We may concede that we are
still within the mongrel concept of Purgatory, but virtually everything
falls within the scope of redemption. It is clearly from such an
evangelism that all the manifest, promotional signs of well-being and
fulfilment derive that are offered us by a paradisaical society subject
to the Eleventh Commandment (\'Be happy and give all the signs of
contentment!\') - the one that cancels out all others. But we can also
read [[this demand for salvation and]{.mark} universal [atonement in the
way that not only all current violence and injustices, but also,
retrospectively, all the crimes]{.mark} and contradictory events [of the
past are now coming in for condemnation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The French
[[Revolution]{.underline}]{.mark} is put in the dock [and
[slavery]{.mark} is condemned]{.underline}, along with original sin and
battered [[wives]{.underline},]{.mark} [the [ozone]{.mark}]{.underline}
layer [and sexual harassment]{.underline}. In short, [the pre-trial
investigation for the Last Judgement is well under way. [We are
**condemning, then pardoning and whitewashing,** our entire
history]{.mark}, exterminating the Evil from even the tiniest crevices
in order to present the image of a radiant universe]{.underline}, ready
to pass into the next world. A gigantic undertaking. One that is
inhuman, superhuman, too human? As Stanislaw Lee says, \'We no doubt
have too anthropomorphic a view of man.\' And **[[why feed this eternal
repentance factory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this chain reaction [of bad
conscience?]{.underline} Because [[everything has to be saved.]{.mark}
This is what we have come to today: [everything will be
redeemed]{.mark}, the entire past will be rehabilitated, polished to the
point of transparency]{.underline}. As for the future, there\'s even
better in store, and even worse: everything will be genetically modified
to achieve biological perfection and the democratic perfection of the
species. Salvation, which was defined by the equivalence of merit and
grace, will, once the abscess of evil and hell has been drained, be
defined by the equivalence between genes and performance. Actually, once
happiness becomes purely and simply the general equivalent of salvation,
there is no further reason for heaven. No heaven without hell, no light
without darkness. No one can be saved if no one is damned (by
definition, but we also know this intuitively: where would the elect
find pleasure, except in the contemplation of God, were it not for the
spectacle of the damned and their torment?). And once everyone is
virtually saved, no one is. Salvation no longer has any meaning. This is
the fate in store for our democratic enterprise: it is vitiated from the
outset by the neglect of necessary discrimination, by the omission of
evil. We therefore need an irrevocable presence of Evil, an Evil with no
possible redemption, a definitive discrimination, a perpetual duality of
Heaven and Hell, and even in a way a predestination to Evil, for no
destiny can be without some predestination. There is nothing immoral in
this. By the rules of the game there is nothing immoral in some losing
and others winning, nor even in everyone losing. What would be immoral
would be for everyone to win. Now, this is the contemporary ideal of our
democracy: that everyone be saved. And this is possible only at the cost
of a perpetual upping of the stakes, of endless inflation and
speculation, since ultimately happiness is not so much an ideal
relationship to the world as a rivalry with, and a victorious relation
to, others. And this is good: it means that the hegemony of Good, of the
individual state of grace, will always be thwarted by some challenge or
passion, and that any kind of happiness, any kind of ecstatic state, can
be sacrificed to something more vital, which may be of the order of the
will, as Schopenhauer has it, or of power, or of the will to power in
Nietzsche\'s conception, but something which, in any event, is of the
order of Evil, of which there is no definition, but which may be summed
up as follows: that which, against any happy intended purpose
\[destination heureuse}, is predestined to come to pass. Beneath its
euphoric exaltation, this imperative of optimum performance, of ideal
achievement, certainly bears evil and misfortune within it, then, in the
form of a profound disavowal of such fine prospects, in the form of a
secret, anticipated disillusion ment. Perhaps [even [this is]{.mark}
again just [a collective form of sacrifice]{.mark}]{.underline} - [a
human sacrifice, but a disembodied one,]{.underline} [[distilled into
**homeopathic doses**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Wherever humans are
condemned to total freedom or to ideal fulfilmen]{.underline}t[, this
subversion seeps in]{.underline} - this automatic abreaction to their
own good and their own happiness. When they are ordered to get the
maximum efficiency and pleasure out of themselves, they remain out of
sorts and live a split existence. In this strange world, where
everything is potentially available (the body, sex, space, money,
pleasure) to be taken or rejected en bloc, everything is there; nothing
has disappeared physically, but everything has disappeared
metaphysically. \'As if by magic or enchantment\', you might say. Only
the fact is, it is more by disenchantment. Individuals, such as they
are, are becoming exactly what they are. With no transcendence and no
image, they pursue their lives like a function that is useless in
respect of another world, irrelevant even in their own eyes. And they do
what they do all the better for the fact that there is no other
possibility. No instance, no essence, no personal substance worthy of
singular expression. [[They have sacrificed their lives to their
functional existences]{.underline}.]{.mark} They coincide with [the
exact]{.underline} numerical [calculation of]{.underline} their
[lives]{.underline} and their performances. [An existence
fulfilled]{.underline}, then, [but one at the same time denied,
thwarted, disavowed]{.underline}. The culmination of a whole negative
counter-transference. This imperative of optimum performance at the same
time comes into internal contradiction with the democratic moral law
which ordains that everyone be perpetually re-set to equality and
everything re-set to zero, on the pretext of democracy and an equal
sharing of opportunity and advantage. Given the prospect of salvation
for all and universal redemption, no one has the right to distinguish
himself, no one has the right to captivate \[siduire[}. [For justice to
be done, all privilege must disappear]{.mark}; it is for all to rid
themselves voluntarily of any specific qualities]{.underline}, to become
once again an elementary particle2 - collective happiness, [[based on
levelling down and repentance,]{.mark} leading to the coming of the
lowest common denominator and basic banalities]{.underline}. This is
like a reverse potlatch, with [everyone outdoing each other in
minimalism and victimhoo]{.underline}d, while fiercely cultivating their
tiniest differences and cobbling together their multiple identities.
[Repentance and recrimination are all part of the same
movement]{.underline}: recrimination means going back over the crime to
correct its course and effects. [[This is what we are doing in going
back over the whole of our history,]{.mark} over the criminal history of
the human race, [to do penance here and now as we await the Last
Judgement]{.mark}.]{.underline} For [God is dead, but his judgement
remains]{.underline}. Which explains the immense syndrome of
resipiscence and (historical) rewriting (with the future genetic and
biological rewriting of the species still to come) that has seized the
twentieth century\'s end; with an eye, as ever, to deserving salvation
and - with the prospect of the final accounting before us - to
presenting the image of an ideal victim. Naturally, we are not speaking
of a real trial or of genuine repentance. [It is a matter of fully
enjoying the spectacle of one\'s own misfortune]{.underline}: \'Mankind,
which in Homer\'s time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian
gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a
degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of the first order\' (Walter Benjamin).3 This is but the latest
episode in a heart-rending process of revisionism - running down not
just the history of the twentieth century, but all the violent events of
past centuries, to subject them to the new jurisdiction of human rights
and crimes against humanity (just as every action today is subjected to
the jurisdiction of sexual, moral or political harassment). As part of
the same trend by which all works of art (including the human genome)
are listed as world heritage sites, [everything is put on the list of
crimes against humanity]{.underline}. The latest episode, then, of this
revisionist madness has been the proposal to condemn slavery and the
slave trade as crimes against humanity. [[An absurd proposal to rectify
the past in terms of our Western humanitarian
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} or, in other words, [in terms of our
own criteria, [in the purest traditions of colonialism.]{.mark} This
imperialism of repentance really is the limit!]{.underline} The idea is,
in fact, to enable the \'peoples concerned\' to put this tragedy behind
them thanks to this official condemnation and, [[once their rights have
been restored]{.mark} and they have been recognized [and celebrated as
victims, to complete their work of mourning]{.mark} and draw a line
under this page of their history in order [to become full participants
in]{.mark} the course of [modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It
might be seen, then, as a kind of successful psychoanalysis. [Perhaps
the Africans will even be able to translate this moral acknowledgement
into damage claims]{.underline}, using the same monstrous measure of
equivalence from which the survivors of the Shoah have been able to
benefit. [So [we shall go on compensating]{.mark}, atoning and
rehabilitating [ad infinitum, and we shall merely have added to raw
exploitation the]{.mark} hypocritical absolution of mourning; we shall
merely, by compassion, have transformed evil into
misfortune.]{.underline} From the standpoint of our [recycled humanism,
the whole of history is pure crime]{.underline} - and, indeed, without
all these crimes there quite simply would be no history: [\'If we
eliminated the evil in man,]{.underline}\' wrote Montaigne, [\'we would
destroy the fundamental conditions of life]{.underline}.\' But, on this
basis, Cain killing Abel is already a crime against humanity - and
almost a genocide (there were only two of them!), and isn\'t original
sin already a crime against humanity? [All this is absurd, all this
humanitarian, retrospective fakery is absurd]{.underline}. And it all
stems from the confusion between evil and misfortune. Evil is the world
as it is and as it has been, and one may look upon this with lucidity.
[Misfortune is the world]{.underline} as it never should have been - but
in the name of what? - in [the name of what should be,]{.underline} in
the name of God or a transcendent ideal, of a Good it would be difficult
indeed to define. We may take a criminal view of crime - that is the
tragic view - or we may take [a recriminatory view - and that is the
humanitarian view, the pathos-laden, sentimental view, the view which
constantly calls for reparation]{.underline}. [[We have here all the
ressentiment dredged up from the depths of a genealogy of
morals]{.mark}, and [requiring in us reparation for our own
lives.]{.mark} This retrospective compassion, [this conversion of evil
into misfortune is the]{.mark} twentieth century\'s [most flourishing
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} First as [[a mental blackmailing
operation]{.mark}, to which we all fall victim]{.underline}, even in our
actions, from which we can now hope only for the lesser evil (keep a low
profile, do everything in such a way as anyone else could have done it -
decriminalize your existence!). [Then as a profitable operation with
gigantic yields, since [misfortune]{.mark}]{.underline} (in all its
forms: from suffering to insecurity, oppression to depression)
[[represents a symbolic capital, the exploitation of
which]{.underline}]{.mark} - even more than the exploitation of
happiness [- [is endlessly profitable]{.underline}]{.mark} [from the
economic standpoint]{.underline}. It\'s a gold-mine, as they say, and
there is an inexhaustible source of ore, because the seam lies within
each of us. Misfortune commands the highest prices, whereas evil cannot
be traded. It is impossible to exchange. [To transcribe evil into
misfortune and then to transcribe misfortune into commercial, or
spectacular, value - most often with the collusion or assent of the
victim himself. But the victim\'s collusion with his own misfortune is
part of the ironic essence of Evil. It is what brings it about that no
one wants his own good, and nothing is for the best in the best of all
worlds]{.underline}

### Industrial Death

#### You goody two shoes propagate life and reason like any fascist. Prefer not life, not reason, and not the good. Affirm your own death, for their propagation of life and reason is much more violent than material dispossession, erecting a violent binary between life and death. The will to die preserves the possibility of singularity.

[[Symbolic exchange]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or rather, its suppression
-- [[plays a central role in the emergence of
capitalism]{.underline}.]{.mark} Baudrillard sees a change happening
over time. [[Regimes based on symbolic exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}
(differences are exchangeable and related) [[are replaced by regimes
based on equivalence]{.underline}]{.mark} (everything is, or means, the
same). [Ceremony gives way to spectacle, immanence to
transcendence.]{.underline} Baudrillard's view of capitalism is derived
from Marx's analysis of value. Baudrillard accepts Marx's view that
capitalism is based on a general equivalent. [Money]{.underline} is the
general equivalent because it can be exchanged for any commodity. In
turn, it [expresses the value of abstract labour-time. Abstract
labour-time is itself an effect of the **[regimenting of processes of
life]{.mark}**, so that different kinds of labour can be compared.
**Capitalism is derived from the autonomisation or separation of
economics** from the rest of life]{.underline}. It turns [economics into
the 'reality-principle']{.underline}. It is a kind of [sorcery,
connected in some way to the disavowed symbolic level]{.underline}. It
subtly [shifts the social world from an exchange of death with the Other
to an eternal return of the Same.]{.underline} Capitalism functions by
[**[reducing everything to a regime based on value]{.mark}** and the
production of value.]{.underline} To be accepted by capital, [something
must contribute value.]{.underline} This [creates an immense regime of
social exchange]{.underline}. However, this social exchange has little
in common with symbolic exchange. It ultimately depends on the [mark of
value itself being unexchangeable. **Capital must be endlessly
accumulated**. States must not collapse. Capitalism thus [introduces the
irreversible into social life]{.mark}, by means of
accumulation.]{.underline} According to Baudrillard, [capitalism [rests
on an obsession with the abolition of death]{.mark}. Capitalism tries to
abolish death [through accumulation.]{.mark} It tries to ward off
ambivalence (associated with death) through value (associated with
life]{.underline}). But this is bound to fail. [General equivalence --
the basis of capitalism -- is itself the ever-presence of death. The
[more the system runs from death, the more it places everyone in
solitude]{.mark},]{.underline} facing their own death. [Life itself is
fundamentally ambivalent. The attempt to abolish death through fixed
value is itself deathly.]{.underline} Accumulation also spreads to other
fields. [The idea of [progress]{.mark}, and linear time, [comes from the
accumulation of time]{.mark}, and of stockpiles of the
past]{.underline}. The [idea of truth comes from the accumulation of
scientific knowledge. Biology rests on the separation of living and
non-living]{.underline}. According to Baudrillard, [such accumulations
are now in crisis. For instance, the accumulation of the past is
undermined, because historical objects now have to be concealed to be
preserved]{.underline} -- otherwise [they will be destroyed by excessive
consumption. [Value is produced from the residue]{.mark} or remainder of
an [incomplete symbolic exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. The repressed,
[market value, and sign-value all come from this remainder. **To destroy
the remainder would be to destroy value**[.]{.mark} Capitalist exchange
is always based on negotiation, even when it is violent. The symbolic
order does not know this kind of equivalential exchange or
calculation]{.underline}. And capitalist extraction is always one-way.
It amounts to a non-[reversible aggression in which one act]{.underline}
(of dominating or killing) [cannot be returned by the
other.]{.underline} It is also this [regime which produces
scarcity]{.underline} -- Baudrillard here endorses [Sahlins'
argument](http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm). [Capitalism
produces the Freudian "death drive",]{.underline} which is actually an
effect of the capitalist culture of death. For Baudrillard, the limit to
both Marx and Freud is that they fail to theorise the separation of the
domains they study -- the economy and the unconscious. It is the
separation which grounds their functioning, which therefore only occurs
under the regime of the code. Baudrillard also criticises theories of
desire, including those of Deleuze, Foucault, Freud and Lacan. He
believes [**desire comes into existence based on repression**. It is an
effect of the denial of the symbolic. Liberated energies always leave a
new remainder;]{.underline} they do [not escape the basis of the
unconscious in the remainder. Baudrillard argues that indigenous groups
do not claim to live naturally or by their desires -- they simply claim
to live in societies]{.underline}. This [[social life is an effect of
the symbolic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Baudrillard therefore [criticises the
view that human liberation can come about through the liberation of
desire.]{.underline} He thinks that such a liberation will keep certain
elements of the repression of desire active. Baudrillard argues that the
[processes which [operate]{.mark} collectively [in indigenous groups are
repressed into the unconscious in metropolitan
societies]{.mark}.]{.underline} This [leads to the autonomy of the
psyche as a separate sphere]{.underline}. It is only after this
repression has occurred that a [politics of desire becomes
conceivable]{.underline}. He professes broad agreement with the
[Deleuzian project of unbinding energies from fixed categories and
encouraging flows and intensities]{.underline}. However, he is
[concerned that [capitalism can recuperate such releases of
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [disconnecting them]{.underline}]{.mark}
[so they can eventually reconnect]{.underline} to it. [Unbinding and
drifting are not fatal to capitalism, because capitalism itself unbinds
things, and re-binds things which are unbound]{.underline}. What is
fatal to it is, rather, reversibility. [[Capitalism continues to be
haunted by the forces it has repressed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Separation
does not destroy the remainder. Quite the opposite. [The remainder
continues to exist, and gains power from its repression. This turns the
double or shadow into something unquiet, vampiric, and threatening. It
becomes an image of the forgotten dead. Anything which reminds us of the
repressed aspects excluded from the subject is experienced as uncanny
and threatening. It becomes the 'obscene']{.underline}, which is present
in excess over the 'scene' of what is imagined. This is different from
theories of lack, such as the Lacanian Real. Baudrillard's remainder is
an excess rather than a lack. It is the carrier of the force of symbolic
exchange. [[Modern culture dreams of radical
difference]{.mark}.]{.underline} The reason for this is that it
exterminated radical difference by simulating it. The energy of
production, the unconscious, and signification all in fact come from the
repressed remainder. [Our culture is dead from having broken the pact
with monstrosity, with radical difference. The [West continues to
perpetrate genocide on indigenous groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} But for
Baudrillard, [it did the same thing to itself first --
[destroying]{.mark} its own indigenous logics of [symbolic
exchange.]{.mark} Indigenous groups have also increasingly lost the
symbolic dimension, as [modern forms of life have been]{.mark} imported
or [imposed.]{.mark} This according to Baudrillard [produces chronic
confusion]{.mark} and instability. [Gift-exchange is radically
subversive of the system]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is not because it is
rebellious. Baudrillard thinks the [system can survive defections or
exodus]{.underline}. It is because it counterposes a different
'principle of sociality' to that of the dominant system. According to
Baudrillard, the [mediations of capitalism exist so that nobody has the
opportunity to offer a symbolic challenge]{.underline} or an
irreversible gift. [They exist to keep the symbolic at bay]{.underline}.
The affective charge of death remains present among the oppressed, but
not with the '[properly symbolic rhythm' of immediate
retaliation]{.underline}. The Church and State also exist based on the
elimination of symbolic exchange. Baudrillard is highly critical of
Christianity for what he takes to be a cult of suffering, solitude and
death. He sees the Church as central to the destruction of earlier forms
of community based on symbolic exchange. Baudrillard seems to think that
earlier forms of the state and capitalism retained some degree of
symbolic exchange, but in an alienated, partially repressed form. For
instance, [[the imaginary of the 'social contract' was based on the idea
of a sacrifice -- this time of liberty]{.mark} for the common good. In
psychoanalysis, symbolic exchange is displaced onto the relationship to
the master-signifier.]{.underline} I haven't seen Baudrillard say it
directly, but [the impression he gives is that this is a distorted,
authoritarian imitation of the original symbolic exchange.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, it retains some of its intensity and energy. Art, theatre
and language have worked to maintain a minimum of ceremonial power. [It
is the reason older orders did not suffer the particular malaise of the
present. It is easy to read certain passages in Baudrillard as if he is
bemoaning the loss of these kinds of strong significations.]{.underline}
This is initially how I read Baudrillard's work. But on closer
inspection, this seems to be a misreading. [Baudrillard is nostalgic for
repression only to the extent that the repressed continued to carry
symbolic force as a referential. He is nostalgic for the return of
symbolic exchange, as an aspect of diffuse, autonomous, dis-alienated
social groups.]{.underline} Death [Death plays a central role in
Baudrillard's theory, and is closely related to symbolic
exchange]{.underline}. According to Baudrillard, what we have [[lost
above all]{.mark} in the transition to alienated society [is the ability
to engage in exchanges with death.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Death should
not be seen here in purely literal terms]{.mark}. Baudrillard specifies
early on that he does not mean an event affecting a body]{.underline},
[but rather, a form which destroys the determinacy of the subject and of
value -- which returns things to a state of indeterminacy. Baudrillard
certainly discusses actual deaths,]{.underline} risk-taking, suicide and
so on. [But he also [sees death figuratively, in relation to the
decomposition of existing relations]{.mark}, the "death" of the
self-image or ego, the interchangeability of processes of life across
different categories]{.underline}. For instance, [eroticism or sexuality
is related to death, because it leads to fusion and communication
between bodies. Sexual reproduction carries shades of death because one
generation replaces another. Baudrillard's concept of death is thus
quite similar to [Bakhtin's concept of the
grotesque](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-bakhtin-2/)]{.underline}.
[[Death refers to metamorphosis]{.mark}, reversibility, unexpected
[mutations]{.mark}, social change, subjective transformation, as well as
physical death.]{.underline} According to Baudrillard, [indigenous
groups see death as social, not natural or biological.]{.underline} They
see it as an [effect of an adversarial will, which they must absorb. And
they mark it with feasting and rituals.]{.underline} This is a way of
[preventing death from becoming an event which does not signify. Such a
non-signifying event is absolute disorder from the standpoint of
symbolic exchange]{.underline}. For Baudrillard, the [[west's idea of a
biological,]{.mark} material death is actually [an idealist illusion,
ignoring the sociality of death]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Poststructuralists generally maintain that the problems of the present
are rooted in the splitting of life into binary
oppositions]{.underline}. For Baudrillard, [the division between life
and death is the original, founding opposition on which the others are
founded]{.underline}. After this first split, a [[whole series of others
have been created]{.mark}, confining particular groups -- the "mad",
prisoners, children, the old, sexual minorities]{.underline}, women and
so on -- to particular segregated situations. **[[The definition of the
'normal human' has been narrowed over time]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Today, nearly everyone belongs to one or another marked or deviant
category. The original exclusion was of the dead -- [it is [defined as
abnormal to be dead]{.mark}. ["You livies hate us
deadies"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDsiv3D9Idg&t=8m26s)]{.underline}.
[This first split and exclusion forms the basis, or archetype, for all
the other splits and exclusions -- along lines of gender, disability,
species, class, and so on.]{.underline} This [[discrimination against
the dead brings]{.mark} into being the [modern experience of
death]{.mark}. Baudrillard suggests that death as we know it does not
exist outside of this separation between living and dead.]{.underline}
The [modern view of death is constructed on the model of the machine and
the function]{.underline}. A machine [[either functions or it does
not]{.mark}. The human [body is treated as a machine]{.mark} which
similarly, either functions or does not.]{.underline} For Baudrillard,
this misunderstands the nature of life and death. The [modern view of
death is also necessitated by the rise of subjectivity. The subject
needs a beginning and an end, so as to be reducible to the story it
tells. This requires an idea of death as an end. It is counterposed to
the immortality of social institutions]{.underline}. In relation to
individuals, [ideas of religious immortality]{.underline} is [simply an
ideological cover for the real exclusion of the dead]{.underline}. But
[institutions try to remain truly immortal. Modern [systems]{.mark},
especially bureaucracies, [no longer know how to die]{.mark} -- or how
to [do anything]{.mark} [but]{.mark} keep [reproducing]{.mark}
themselves.]{.underline} The [internalisation of the idea of the subject
or the soul [alienates us from our bodies]{.mark}, voices and so
on.]{.underline} It [creates a split]{.underline}, as Stirner would say,
[between the category of 'man' and the 'un-man',]{.underline} the real
self irreducible to such categories. [It also individualises people, by
destroying their actual connections to others]{.underline}. The
[[symbolic haunts the code]{.mark} as the threat of its own
death]{.underline}. The [society of the code works constantly to ward
off the danger of irruptions of the symbolic. The [mortal body is
actually an effect of the split]{.mark} introduced by the foreclosure of
death]{.underline}. The [split never actually stops exchanges across the
categories]{.underline}. In the case of death, [we still 'exchange' with
the dead through our own deaths and our anxiety about
death]{.underline}. We no [longer have living, mortal relationships with
objects either. They are reduced to the instrumental]{.underline}. It is
as if we have a [transparent veil between us. [Symbolic exchange is
based on a game]{.mark}, with game-like rules.]{.underline} When this
disappears, [laws and the state are invented to take their place. It is
the process of excluding, marking, or barring which allows concentrated
or transcendental power to come into existence.]{.underline} Through
splits, people turn the other into their 'imaginary'. For instance,
[[westerners invest the "Third World" with racist fantasies]{.mark} and
revolutionary aspirations; the "Third World" invests the west with
aspirational fantasies of development. In separation, the other exists
only as an imaginary object. Yet the resultant purity is
illusory.]{.underline} For Baudrillard, any such marking or [barring of
the other brings the other to the core of society. "[We all" become
dead,]{.mark} or mad, or prisoners,]{.underline} and so on, through
their exclusion. The [goal of 'survival' is fundamental to the birth of
power. Social control emerges when the union of the living and the dead
is shattered, and the dead become prohibited]{.underline}. The [social
[repression of death grounds the repressive socialisation of
life]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} People are [[compelled to survive so
as to become useful]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Baudrillard, [capitalism's
original relationship to death has historically been concealed by the
system of production,]{.underline} and its ends. It only becomes fully
visible now this [system is collapsing, and production is reduced to
operation.]{.underline} In modern societies, [death is made invisible,
denied, and placed outside society.]{.underline} For example, elderly
people are excluded from society. [People no longer expect their own
death. As a result, it becomes unintelligible. It keeps returning as
'nature which will not abide by objective laws'. It can no longer be
absorbed through ritual. Western society is arranged so death is never
done by someone else, but always attributable to 'nature'. This creates
a bureaucratic, judicial regime of death, of which the concentration
camp is the ultimate symbol]{.underline}. The system now [commands that
we must not die]{.underline} -- at least not in any old way. [[**We may
only die if law and medicine allow** it.]{.mark} Hence for instance the
spread of health and safety regulations. [On the other hand, murder and
violence are legalised, provided they can be re-converted into economic
value.]{.mark} Baudrillard sees this as a regressive redistribution of
death. It is wrested from the circuit of social exchanges and vested in
centralised agencies.]{.underline}

"///" in between paragraphs NT 17

These **[[technological]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[managerial
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[do nothing to
subvert]{.mark} the speed-elitist system and [ideology that
**underlie**]{.mark}]{.underline} the problem of [**[climate
change]{.underline}**,]{.mark} as they do not go far enough in
challenging speed-elitism\'s fundamental assumptions and techniques.
This means that [the activist promise of]{.underline} the [**future
absolution** by way of **humanist-scientific thought** from
the]{.underline} future [threat of global warming]{.underline}
immediately [aggravates **disenfranchisement and
pollution**]{.underline} now. Let me illustrate this by first briefly
analysing [a widely used educational game designed to combat climate
change called Global Warming
Interactive]{.underline}---[C02Fx]{.underline}. This web-based game,
funded by the United States National Science Foundation and developed by
environmentalists from a range of American consultancies and educational
organisations, aims at teaching secondary-school students the sorts of
decision making involved in global warming. The game invariably starts
with a map of the country of Brazil in the 1960s, and gives statistics
about the carbon emission, air temperature, and general welfare of the
population. The player can control government budget expenditures for
science, agriculture, social services, and development initiatives,
after which the game timeline jumps ten years into the future,
generating results based on these expenditures. The game ends by showing
the relative increase in temperature in the virtual year of 2060,
warning the player that more international cooperation is required to
really tackle global warming. /// The problem with [Global Warming
Interactive]{.underline} is that it completely [obscures the
relationship between]{.underline} the computing [technology that
sustains]{.underline} the C02Fx [simulation and the reality of climate
change]{.underline}. A telling moment of this dissimulation is when
[[the **game** urges the player to \'**switch off** the television!\'
while]{.mark} the [energy]{.mark} consumption involved in
the]{.underline} infrastructure, mode of [production]{.underline} and
[**dissemination**, student use, and tools [that sustain the
game]{.mark} itself [is **blissfully ignored**]{.mark}. If one wants to
**seriously reduce consumption**, the game **should not have been
played**]{.underline} or even produced [at all. [The
game]{.mark}]{.underline} [also [**oversimplifies** how government
**decisions** affect]{.underline} ]{.mark}a [[**complex**]{.mark} issue
like [**climate change**, and is fraught with **problematic**]{.mark}
**and**]{.underline} often **[[technoutopian
assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** about how to tackle climate change. A
good example of this is the recurring recommendation throughout the game
to the player to spend more money on scientific research, as this
expenditure will supposedly solve or alleviate global warming. [The
**speed-elitist, humanist, and techno-utopian discourses** that
permeate]{.underline} American [academia]{.underline} and consultancy
firms are clearly reflected in Global Warming Interactive, [[inculcating
the **student** with a set of **beliefs** that lies]{.underline}]{.mark}
precisely [[at the **base of**]{.underline}]{.mark} current
**[[environmental pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ironically, it is
this [speed-elitist]{.underline} system of [beliefs and
techniques]{.underline} that in turn [cause]{.underline}s
[the]{.underline} kinds of [**economical disenfranchisement** that
**urges**]{.underline} certain groups of [poor people]{.underline} in a
country like Brazil [to **survive** on **environmentally unfriendly**
business **solutions**, like slash-burning]{.underline} the
[forests]{.underline}. One is also left to wonder why the game uses
Brazil in the first place, and not the United States---arguably the
largest global polluter today. [There is]{.underline} indeed [a
**problematic neo-colonialist undertone** to the one-country version of
Global Warming]{.underline} Interactive. [Extending]{.underline} the
content of [the game by including more countries in the
simulation]{.underline}, as the developers seek to do, would not assuage
this problem, but would [concur with the]{.underline} contemporary
[shift from]{.underline} previous [colonialist to **speed-elitist
hierarchies** by]{.underline} way of a [**global encapsulation**. [By
giving]{.mark} the player [**simulated governmental
omnipotence**]{.mark} through]{.underline} the [**\'archiving\'**
of]{.underline} the [economical and social **structures underlying**
global **warming**]{.underline} in that \'other\' country of Brazil,
[[the player gets the **illusion** of dealing]{.mark} constructively
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the major \'accident\' of [[climate
change]{.mark} and its impact on **threatened peoples** [while]{.mark}
**actually [fuelling it]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Meanwhile,
[**player or [student]{.mark}** [**empathy and activity** are
**displaced** into]{.mark} the instantaneous [networks
of]{.mark}]{.underline} ever increasing [**[neo-liberal circulation and
production]{.underline}**]{.mark}. /// [[The **illusion of constructive
engagement**]{.mark} with]{.underline} the pressing [climate
change]{.underline} issue [through seemingly \'clean\' and \'neutral\'
technologies, together with the **distancing**]{.underline} effect
[brought about by these technologies]{.underline} from their social and
environmental implications, [[make the **student and activist**]{.mark}
unwittingly [**complicit** in the **globalising neo-liberal
endeavour**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The same goes for the recent
spate of \'climate change apps\' like Greenmeter and GreenYou for
iPhone, as well as the various global \'climate app contests\' set up by
the United Nations and the World Bank. Environmental salvation is in
these applications always just around the corner. The World Bank
contest, for instance, states in full speed-elitist fashion that
\'Access to freely available climate-related data is essential to
catalyze the changes in policies, investments and technologies that will
be needed if we are to move towards a climate-smart future.\' But all
[such]{.underline} applications and [contests]{.underline} really do is
[produc]{.underline}ing [globally networked flows and
reproduc]{.underline}ing [the mirage of the **human
participant-consumer-activist** at the centre of revolutionary
change]{.underline} through ~~her or his~~ techne. So despite, or rather
again because of, the good intentions of the activists and educators who
built such applications, these [games exhibit a **virtualisation of
thought and action** under neo-liberal globalisation and its
speed-elitist modes of intensified inclusion and exclusion]{.underline}.
These [games]{.underline} can therefore be understood as attempts at
(eventually unsuccessfully) [manag]{.underline}ing [and
contain]{.underline}ing [the **\'accident of the real\'** brought about
by the technologies of speed]{.underline}. What is even more worrisome
is that [the]{.underline} very [attempt to **raise awareness about
climate change**]{.underline}---the unveiling of the \'real\' problem
underlying globalisation today---[results in the intensified
**capitalist circulation of \'the real\' as sign** in the
media]{.underline}, just as Baudrillard also suggests. /// I am using
this minor example of a didactic video game here to illustrate the
extent to which the [political and managerial attempts at combating
climate change]{.underline} themselves [follow the representational and
aesthetic logic of the]{.underline} mass and new [media]{.underline}. So
[while C02Fx is]{.underline} arguably \'just [a game\' with artificially
set parameters, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[same **logic of
simulation** operates on the **scale of global politics**]{.mark}
by]{.underline} means of [the apocalyptic staging and subsequent
economical, scientific, and technical propositions]{.underline}.
Moreover, the activist argument that requires the justification of these
propositions and attempts by signifying the \'real\' problem, like
\'nature\' with earlier environmental politics, renders such activism as
well as my deconstructivist book complicit in speed-elitism by virtue of
their promissory status and apocalyptic narrative. Contra, for instance,
the claim by Erik Swyngedouw in \'Apocalypse Forever?\' that the climate
change model signals the post-political moment (215), I suggest that it
is by [reworking the apocalyptic narrative]{.underline} present [in the
environmental imperative through climate change activism and
its]{.underline} affirmation of the [underlying assumptions of global
warming]{.underline} that [results in the intensification of politics on
which speed-elitism thrives. I]{.underline} hence [do not agree with
Swyngedouw that \'apocalyptic imaginations]{.underline} are decidedly
populist and [foreclose proper political framing\']{.underline} (219),
because within these imaginaries resides also the critique of a
monstrous capitalism that Swyngedouw so astutely retrieves. So whereas
the climate change model and its current \'solutions\' decidedly reflect
the neo-liberal status quo, I would hesitate to suggest that [climate
change is a deliberate]{.underline} governmental or corporate [ploy to
rule by]{.underline} means of [fear]{.underline} so as [to better
exploit citizenconsumers]{.underline}, although government and industry
certainly have stepped onto the greenhouse bandwagon [to expand the
futures and derivatives market and to sell \'green\' products and
incentives]{.underline}. Rather, [at issue is the **politics of
acceleration** behind the **construction of reality** by]{.underline}
means of the discursive and material techniques of [**visualisation and
dissimulation**.]{.underline}

#### The will to project the self into a coherent position of opposition naturalizes the false binary choice of being for or against war -- these banal oppositional stances reinforces fantasies of democratic deliberation and destroy agency -- refuse the coercive false choice of war porn which reproduces militarism.

**Shapiro 14.** Alan Shapiro, senior lecturer at Offenbach Art and
Design University in Germany, \"Jean Baudrillard and Albert Camus on the
Simulacrum of Taking a Stance on War,\" International Journal of
Baudrillard Studies, Volume 11, Number 2 (May, 2014)

The [[stance of opposition to]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} undertaken by
America's 'military-industrial complex']{.underline} (MIC), as President
Dwight D. E[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}enhower termed it in his Farewell
Address to the nation on January 17, 1961 after spending 8 years as
President[, seems to be [based on]{.mark} the [assumption of]{.mark} the
[discursive viability of projecting oneself into the imaginative space
of]{.mark}]{.underline} being [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} sort of '[[shadow
government of truth-speakers',]{.underline}
[empowered]{.underline}]{.mark} by democracy [[into the democratic
position]{.mark} of being able to [make 'better' decisions for the body
politic]{.mark}]{.underline} of democracy [[than those who hold]{.mark}
institutional [power]{.mark}]{.underline} in political economy and
government. Most [political discourse in [the]{.mark} U.S]{.underline}.,
including the [[anti-war stance]{.underline}]{.mark}, seems to [[take
for granted]{.mark} the idea [that we should clarify 'our politics' by
imaginatively putting ourselves 'in the shoes' of national strategists
choosing]{.mark} among the [policy options]{.mark}
available]{.underline}. Apocalypse Now Jean Baudrillard expands our
sense of what is history because he does not operate with a strict
separation between what are 'the facts' and what are the engaging
stories that we as a culture have written and enacted about important
'historical' events. [Much of what we know]{.underline} about the
Holocaust, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War [comes from
Hollywood films]{.underline} about the Holocaust, the Second World War,
and the Vietnam War that we have seen. In his essay on Francis Ford
Coppola's 1979 blockbuster Vietnam War movie [Apocalypse
Now]{.underline}, Baudrillard writes that Coppola's masterpiece [is the
continuation of the Vietnam War by other means.]{.underline} "Nothing
else in the world smells like that," says Lt. Colonel Bill Kilgore --
played by Robert Duvall -- in the 2 hour and 33 minute film. "I love the
smell of napalm in the morning... It smells like victory." The
high-budget extravaganza was produced exactly the same way that America
fought in Vietnam, says Jean Baudrillard of the film made by director
Francis Ford Coppola (Baudrillard 1981: 89-91). "[War becomes
film]{.underline}," Baudrillard writes of Coppola's spectacularly
successful cinematic creation. "[Film becomes war, the two united by
their shared overflowing of technology]{.underline}" (Ibid.: 89). [There
is implosion or mutual contamination between 'film becoming Virtual
Reality' and War]{.underline}. Think also of Steven Spielberg's Saving
Private Ryan (1998): total immersion in the Virtual Reality of combat --
an aesthetics of VR different from 'critical distance' -- as a new kind
of 'testimonial position' with respect to war and atrocities. [In
Vietnam-slash-Apocalypse Now, [War is a Drug Trip and a God Trip, a
psychedelic and pornographic carnival]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard
2010), [[a savage cannibalism]{.mark} practiced by the Christians, a
film before the shooting and a shoot before the filming, [a]{.mark} vast
[machine of]{.mark} excessive [special effects, a 'show of power',
a]{.mark} territorial [lab for testing]{.mark} new [weapons on human
guinea pigs, and]{.mark} the sacrificial jouissance of throwing away
billions of dollars]{.underline} -- all these aspects alluded to or
mentioned by Baudrillard. Coppola's [film]{.underline}, according to
Baudrillard, [is the carrying on of an [undeclared, unfinished and
unending War]{.mark}. An interminable Heart of Darkness]{.underline}.
Baudrillard: Neither For Nor Against Jean [[Baudrillard is]{.mark} not
'against war',]{.underline} not even against specific wars like the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq. He says this explicitly in "Le masque de la
guerre," published in the Parisian daily newspaper Libération, just
prior to President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003. Ni pour ni
contre. [[Neither for nor against.]{.underline} "[This war is a
non-event]{.underline},]{.mark}" writes Baudrillard, "[[and it is absurd
to take a stance]{.mark} on a non-event]{.underline} (Baudrillard
2003)." [The non-events of the Iraq War and the War on Terror opposed
themselves to the event of September 11th, 2001.]{.underline} Hostages
of the Screen Baudrillard's two most explicit texts about war are The
Gulf War Did Not Take Place (1991), written just before, during, and
just after the Persian Gulf War of 1991 that was initiated by President
George H.W. Bush, and The Spirit of Terrorism (2002), written just after
9/11. At the very beginning of the essay "The Gulf War Will Not Take
Place," the first of the three essays that comprise The Gulf War Did Not
Take Place, Baudrillard explains that [non-war -- which is what the
military-industrial complex]{.underline} or the (non-)war machine [has
become]{.underline} very [adept at carrying out in the age of virtuality
-- "is characterised by]{.underline} that [degenerate]{.underline} form
of [war which includes hostage manipulation and negotiation]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 1995: 24). The Eisenhower-coined term of the
military-industrial complex is used by Baudrillard in his essay \"No
Reprieve For Sarajevo,\" published in Libération, January 8, 1994. He
sees the MIC as still operative yet in need of conceptual upgrading.
"[Hostages and ~~blackmail~~]{.underline}," Baudrillard continues in
"The Gulf War Will Not Take Place," "[are the purest products of
deterrence]{.underline}. [The hostage has taken the place of the
warrior. He has become the principal actor, the simulacral
protagonist,]{.underline} or rather, in his pure inaction, the
protagoniser (le protagonisant) [of non-war]{.underline}" (Baurillard
1995: 24). [And we, the television viewers of the non-war, are
all]{.underline} in the situation of hostages, "all of us as
[information hostages on the world media stage"]{.underline} (Ibid.).
[Hostages of the screen, of the intoxication of the media, dragged and
drugged into a logic of deterrence]{.underline}, \"we are no longer in a
logic of the passage from virtual to actual but in a hyperrealist logic
of the deterrence of the real by the virtual" (Ibid.: 27). Four Aspects
of a Baudrillardian Theory of War The post-structure \[the successor to
a sociological structure with less stability and with less of a center\]
of the (non-)war machine in the age of media virtuality has properties
of binary/digital, simulation/modeling, viral metastasis, and complex
intricate paradoxical topology. Let us consider all four of these
properties as aspects of a Baudrillardian theory of war (or a theory of
war in honour of Jean Baudrillard). War as Imposed Binary Choice First
of all, [[the]{.mark}]{.underline} post-[structure of the ([non-)war
machine]{.mark} in the age of media virtuality]{.underline} has the
property of binary/digital. It [[presents]{.mark} itself to us through
[the dualistic]{.mark} structure of a [forced binary
choice]{.mark}]{.underline}, [where the system o[bliges]{.mark} each of
[us to take a position 'for' or 'against' war]{.mark},]{.underline} or
'for' or 'against' particular wars, as waged, for example, by the
Pentagon, the EU 'humanitarian' forces, or the surveillance state's War
on Terror. [It is [this very binary logic of 'yes' or 'no']{.mark} that
[is]{.mark} the news media discourse, [the rhetoric of
politicians]{.mark}, and the hybrid virtual-and-real-killing of the
screen and the bomb]{.underline}. Today, of course, the Internet has
superceded television as the prevailing universal media (although there
is much convergence and combination of the two). And the Internet is
much more interactive and participatory. There is much more response.
There is much less of a 'spectacle' than there was when Guy Debord and
the Situationists conceptualized their media theory in the 1960s. Yet
[everywhere]{.underline} that [the 'news media' and the (non)-war
machine still prevail, everywhere that they are still massively
influential, everywhere that they still exercise their power, we are not
quite liberated from the 'speech without response']{.underline}
described by the early Baudrillard. [When]{.underline} Muammar
[Gaddafi]{.underline}, the former dictator of Libya, [was brutally
killed]{.underline} by rebel forces on October 20, 2011, during the
Libyan Civil War, [the event]{.underline}, having been filmed by a cell
phone, [was presented]{.underline} to worldwide viewers by almost all of
the 'news media' [as some kind of triumph for 'justice', even though it
was clearly a loss for democratic principles and the possible coming to
light of priceless information about the decades of
atrocities]{.underline} committed by Gaddafi's regime during a public
trial which would never take place. The later Baudrillard develops the
powerful idea that [the only authentic communicative exchange that is
possible today in the context of over-saturation]{.underline} with,
[of]{.underline} and by [simulacral media pseudo-exchanges is an
'impossible exchange']{.underline}. In the chapter "Living Coin:
Singularity of the Phantasm" in the book ImpossibleExchange (1999),
Baudrillard elaborates his idea of a generalized economy (not the same
as Bataille's principle of solar expenditure or the basing of a general
economy on a solar economy): "[the reinvesting of the sphere of all
exchange by that which cannot possibly be exchanged]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard 2001: 122-131, see also Baudrillard 1976). [There is
something of no-value at the heart of the economic order.]{.underline}
Baudrillard provides the example of the film Indecent Proposal (1993),
in which the billionaire character John Gage, played by Robert Redford,
in the setting of a Las Vegas casino, purchases the sexual-amorous
favours of the married woman character Diana Murphy, played by Demi
Moore, for the sum of one million dollars. As Baudrillard interprets the
film, Redford seeks to possess the "unexchangeable part of this woman,"
that portion of herself that is outside of the exchange nexus for the
simple reason that she herself does not own and therefore cannot sell
what she is. Baudrillard calls this "obliterating wealth in and through
the sign of wealth (Baudrillard 2001: 123-124). In the moment of their
first meeting, Gage asks Murphy to bet a million dollars at the roulette
table for him. She and his chips are wagered, thereby establishing the
shared valuelessness -- in the sense of being outside the system of
value -- of both the clichéd legendary sum of one million dollars and
the enjoyment of and by this singular woman. The Model Precedes the Real
In writing about the Persian Gulf War in 1991, [Baudrillard notes the
[victory of the model]{.mark} which [precedes]{.mark} 'the
[real']{.mark}, the triumph of 'war processing']{.underline} (on analogy
with 'data processing' and 'word processing'), [the predomination of
virtual technologies]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} post-[structure of
the (non-)war machine]{.underline} in the age of media virtuality [has
the property of simulation/modelling]{.underline}. There is the
simulacrum of the disappeared "historical" referent of war, and the
triumph of informational and gaming technologies. Baudrillard writes in
"The Gulf War: Is It Really Taking Place?": ["The victory of the model
is more important than [victory on the ground]{.mark}. Military success
consecrates the triumph of arms, but the programming success consecrates
the defeat of time. War-processing, the transparency of the model in the
unfolding of the war, the strategy of relentless execution of a
program]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1995: 55-56). [In that
[non-war]{.mark} that 'did not take place', there was the emergence of
an abstract, electronic, speculative, informatic space]{.underline}.
"Just as wealth is no longer measured by the ostentation of wealth but
by the secret circulation of speculative capital, so [war [is not
measured by being waged but by]{.mark} its [speculative unfolding in
an]{.mark} abstract, [electronic and informational
space]{.mark}]{.underline}, the same space [in which capital
moves]{.underline}" (Ibid.: 56). In addition to careful management of
images and information content, [the [true devastation]{.mark} of war
[is kept at bay]{.mark}]{.underline} from our perceptions [[by
simulation technologies]{.mark} ranging from the televisual screen to
the military 'smart weapons']{.underline} deployed from altitudes of
tens of thousands of feet. During months of preparation for the 'war',
[viewers experience endless military experts paraded across their
screen, [endlessly analyzing scenarios before they happen]{.mark}. The
pilot]{.underline} in his simulator cockpit, [or]{.underline} the
[gunner]{.underline} in his high-tech tank, [is surrounded by a virtual
environment]{.underline} and motion-dependent images [which are the same
whether he is [in]{.mark} a [war game training]{.mark} exercise or a
'real engagement']{.underline}. A Non-Euclidean Spacetime The
post-structure of the (non-)war machine in the age of media virtuality
has the property of complex intricate paradoxical topology. There is the
"non-Euclidean" spacetime of multiple refracting waves in an enigmatic
hyperspace beyond any classical geometry. In "The Gulf War: Is It Really
Taking Place?," Baudrillard (1995: 49-50) writes: [At a certain
speed,]{.underline} the speed [of information, things lose their
sense... War implodes]{.underline} in real time, [history
implodes]{.underline} in real time, [all communication and all
signification implode]{.underline} in real time... The space of the
event has become a hyperspace with multiple refractivity, and that the
space of war has become definitively non-Euclidean. To understand the
complex non-Euclidean informational space of non-war, we need a new
mathematics, a new unconventional metric space. In mathematics, a metric
space is a set where a specific concept of distance between elements of
the set is defined and implemented. Three-dimensional Euclidean space --
a way of thinking about space that belongs to the Western metaphysical
'construction of reality' as it was originated by the Ancient Greek
thinkers -- corresponds to our 'intuitive understanding' of space. 1991
Persian Gulf War Shortly before 7 PM on the evening of January 16, 1991
(January 17, early AM, in the Gulf), Network nightly news viewers were
informed that heavy bombing of strategic targets inside Iraq had been
initiated. At 9 PM, President George H.W. Bush enthusiastically told the
viewing audience that "the liberation of Kuwait has begun." Pentagon
spokespersons explained that massive pinpoint strikes by high-tech
planes against carefully selected military sites and command
headquarters had caught the Iraqis entirely off guard. Reports of great
success came in. [The nation rejoiced. It was our grand celebration. We
feted our triumph in the Cold War. The glamorous high-tech weapons,
developed and paid for over years, could finally be used in the real
thing, and the Soviets were nowhere in sight. We were back. After the
wrenching stalemate of Vietnam, we could finally start again. [The enemy
was]{.mark} an inert physical installation, [a blip on a radar screen to
be methodically]{.mark} ~~darkened~~
\[[eliminated]{.mark}\].]{.underline} The Fourth Order of Simulacra
[The]{.underline} post-[structure]{.underline} [of the (non-)war
machine]{.underline} in the age of media virtuality [has the property of
viral metastasis. There is the news media becoming part of the terror.
There are the surveillance policies of the state becoming part of the
terror]{.underline}. In the essay "After the Orgy" in the book The
Transparency of Evil, Baudrillard writes of the "epidemic of
simulation," a networked mode of fractal or viral dispersal. Updating
his famous theses of "the three orders of simulacra" (in Symbolic
Exchange and Death) and "the precession of simulacra" (in Simulacra and
Simulation), he seeks to introduce "a new particle into the microphysics
of simulacra (Baudrillard 1993: 5): The first of these stages had a
natural referent, and value developed on the basis of a natural use of
the world. The second was founded on a general equivalence, and value
developed by reference to a logic of the commodity. The third is
governed by a code, and value develops here by reference to a set of
models. At the fourth, the fractal (or viral, or radiant) stage of
value, [there is no point of reference at all, and value radiates in all
directions]{.underline}...(Ibid.: 5, 7). This is the fractal or viral
stage of fourth-order simulacra. In Baudrillard's post-simulation
epistème or \"epidemic of simulation,\" [value]{.underline} - if that
term is still appropriate - [radiates in all directions in a cancerous
metastasis]{.underline}. [There is \"no relationship between cause and
effect, merely viral relationships between one effect and
another]{.underline}" (Ibid.: 108). [All spheres of society pass into
their free-floating, excessive, and ecstatic form]{.underline}.
September 11, 2001 In "The Spirit of Terrorism," the first essay of the
book The Spirit of Terrorism(2002), Baudrillard writes of the event of
September 11, 2001: [The more concentrated the system becomes
globally,]{.underline} ultimately forming one single network, [the more
it becomes vulnerable at a single point]{.underline} (already a single
little Filipino hacker had managed, from the the dark recesses of his
portable computer, to launch the 'I love you' virus, which circled the
globe devastating entire networks)... [Terrorism, like viruses, is
everywhere. There is a global perfusion of terrorism, which accompanies
any system of domination]{.underline} as though it were its shadow,
[ready to activate itself anywhere, like a double agent. We can no
longer draw a demarcation line around it. It is at the very heart of
this culture which combats it]{.underline}... [Terrorism is the shock
wave of this silent reversion]{.underline} (2002: 8-9, 10, 11). [After
each terrorist attack]{.underline}, [there is a feeling in the air of
panic and confusion]{.underline} in the news media [as]{.underline} the
police and Federal Investigators identify and catch the perpetrators,
and [the information society scrambles to find out 'who did
it'.]{.underline} Abu Ghraib Torture and Prisoner Abuse This is how the
English-language Wikipedia article on "Abu Ghraib Torture and Prisoner
Abuse" begins: During the War in Iraq, human rights violations,
committed from late 2003 to early 2004, in the form of physical,
psychological, and sexual abuse, including torture, reports of rape,
sodomy, and homicide of prisoners held in the Abu Ghraib prison
(currently known as the Baghdad Central Prison) came to public attention
beginning in early 2004 with Department of Defense announcements. These
acts were committed by military police personnel of the United States
Army together with those of additional US governmental
agencies.[1](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-shapiro.html#ft-endnote1)
On May 19, 2004, Jean Baudrillard published the essay "Pornographie de
la guerre" in the Parisian daily newspaper Libération. (published as
"War Porn" in English) The philosopher, sociologist, and media theorist
writes: World Trade Center: shock treatment of power, humiliation
inflicted on power, but from outside. With the images of the Baghdad
prisons, it is worse, it is the humiliation, symbolic and completely
fatal, which the world power inflicts on itself -- the Americans in this
particular case -- the shock treatment of shame and bad conscience. This
is what binds together the two events (Baudrillard 2004). [[To keep the
hyper-reality of cyberwar going,]{.mark} the ghost-[people must]{.mark}
continue to [exercise]{.mark} a certain 'minimal' function in the real.
To lend the game its requisite weight or support, they must furnish
[a]{.mark} necessary [dose of reality]{.mark}-effect through the
chalking up of their disappearance. A certain number of [victims of
torture]{.mark}, rape, [and murder]{.mark} are required to
[provide]{.mark} data]{.underline} ('[[fresh meat']{.underline}) [to
keep the]{.underline}]{.mark} [electronic [killing game
going]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially if they can be photographed, and
then the images sent out on the universal image-viewing
network.]{.underline} Baudrillard continues in "War Porn": [This is
where the truth of [these images]{.mark} lies]{.underline}; this is what
they [[are full of]{.underline}]{.mark}: [the [excessiveness of]{.mark}
a [power]{.mark} designating itself [as abject and pornographic]{.mark}.
Truth but not veracity: it does not help to know whether the images are
true or false... There is no longer the need for 'embedded' journalists
because soldiers themselves are immersed in the image]{.underline} --
thanks to digital technology, the images are definitively integrated
into the war. [They don¹t represent it anymore; they involve neither
distance, nor perception, nor judgment]{.underline}...(Ibid.). Media
images in general -- in advertising, for example -- signify the excess
of wealth that we as citizens of the West have the prerogative of
partaking in. [The abject and disgusting images of the Abu Ghraib
torture and prisoner abuse atrocity are the dark underside of media
culture. Beyond the epistemology of true and false, [the]{.mark} digital
technology [image]{.mark} has [inscribe]{.mark}d [within]{.mark} itself
the [tautological]{.mark} reasoning of the [self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline}, inheriting from advertising and the
classical era of consumer culture the mastery of the art of rendering
things true by saying that they are. For Baudrillard, all images in
contemporary culture tend towards the pornographic. The visual culture
of stylized images is obscene and pornographic at every level -- from
hard-core porno to 'music television', from swimsuit magazines to
commonplace TV commercials.

### Security (Bishop)

#### Your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint, condemning the world to the simulacral existence of peace and security, your acts of piety and pity are absurd, committed as if they were irresistible. Your promises are a life spent wandering the surface of the world with minimal intensity---life spent playing penny slots and drinking bud light instead of ever risking anything or buying the good shit. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time.

Perspectives in Baudrillard Studies, polity, ed. R. Bishop pg.
65-70\|KZaidi

Although death is pivotal to many whose work falls within the domain of
critical theory, Baudrillard's work, perhaps more so than others',
articulates, embodies, and enacts the [role of Death within theoretical
writing and its relation to the political. [Death]{.mark}, and
especially the death drive]{.underline} in Freud according to
Baudrillard, [[does not provide any space for the operation of
dialectical co-option]{.mark} or reclamation.]{.underline} And it is
this trait, [Death's [absolute imperviousness to the dialectic]{.mark},
that [makes it radical]{.mark}, intractable, usable]{.underline}
(Symbolic Exchange and Death, 151). Such is the [position that
Baudrillard himself assumes within analyses of media, simulation, the
subject, the object, politics, war, economics, culture, the event,
theory itself, and thought]{.underline}. In relation to systems, the
[Death that Baudrillard wishes to address functions in a two-fold
manner: it is what waits at "the term of the system" -- at its end --
and it is "the symbolic exter- mination that stalks the system
itself]{.underline}" (Symbolic Exchange of Death, 5). Therefore [[Death
is both internal to the system and its "operational
logic]{.mark}"]{.underline} and "a radical-finality" outside it. Only
[Death operates both within and without the system (5). As such it
carries the mark of perfection]{.underline} (completion of the system's
operation and project) and the [defectiveness inherently lurking within
it. [Death is ambiguity and paradox made manifest,]{.mark} and is both
[the system's realization and its impediment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Death [resists modeling]{.mark}]{.underline}, the simulation. Its [lack
of predictability and the difficulty in controlling it]{.underline}, in
fact, [resides at the center of the various systems]{.underline},
policies, and logics that drive the Cold War. [Death is the [event
without compare]{.mark}]{.underline} and which must be elided at all
costs. [Under the patriotic yet threatening rubrics of security, safety,
"our way of life," etc., the [entire elaborate apparatus of the Cold War
was erected and launched]{.mark}]{.underline}, while also [continuing
with intensified reverberations into the present -- all to ward off
Death on a scale hitherto the domain of Nature or the gods]{.underline}.
Following a lead from the poet Octavio Paz and sounding like an
interlocutor of Paul Virilio's, [Baudrillard discusses [Death]{.mark},
therefore, [in terms of the accident]{.mark}]{.underline} (Symbolic
Exchange and Death, 160--6). For as Paz contends, [[modern
science]{.mark} and technology]{.underline}, including medicine, h[ave
[converted]{.mark} epidemics and natural [catastrophes into explain-
able and controllable phenomena]{.mark}. The rational order can explain
and contain anything that threatens it]{.underline}, as can Integral
Reality (for which the rational order is another metonym, as is the
global). As such, [[Death becomes an accident to be contained]{.mark}
and controlled, explained and predicted]{.underline}. If [Death equals
an accident, and accidents threaten the rational order,]{.underline}
Baudrillard argues, then [Death-as- accident also [threatens political
sovereignty]{.mark} and power]{.underline}, "hence the police presence
at the scenes of catastrophe" (161). [Death is the disruption that
[destabilizes all that has been ordered]{.mark} and made
stable.]{.underline}

At the height of the Cold War as an historical phenomenon, the [major
powers relied heavily on a rational order that both players
acknowledged]{.underline} (at least between themselves) to be
operational. This [[led to the]{.mark} enforced and heavily armed
[stalemate of MAD]{.mark}]{.underline}, and with it arrived the horrific
spectacle of the nuclear accident, or the com- puter accident. The
[accidental launch of the impossible exchange of missiles would be, in
rote pronouncements of certitude,]{.underline} "the only way" these
[rational and sane nations would fire nuclear weapons: hence the many
examples of cultural representations of accidental nuclear war that
filled popular media]{.underline} (invoking worlds synonymous to the one
portrayed as the simulated wasteland in The Island). The im[port of
[simulation in containing Death]{.mark} on a global scale can [be seen
in]{.mark} the [supposed rational containment]{.mark} of both the
opposition and oneself.]{.underline} The simulated [[scenarios of both
war games]{.mark} and accidental launches, the modeling of events,
become a [kind of necromantic]{.mark} or occult [means of controlling
unleashed forces]{.mark} and foretelling possible futures in order to
prevent the accident (or the event) -- to prevent Death
itself.]{.underline}

The thought processes, or [[mental make-up, required to plan]{.mark} and
design large-scale modeling meant to [pre-empt accidents]{.mark} are
themselves a kind of technology of thinking]{.underline}, and this
[[mental technicity comprises]{.mark} an important [element in the
construction of Integral Reality]{.mark}. Simulation requires faith not
in its own verisi- militude but in its capacity to change events, even
Death.]{.underline} The [US embodies this kind of faith]{.underline} and
has from the Cold War to the present, which, as such, becomes a target
for many satiric novelists. One particularly influenced by Baudrillard's
ideas about simulation is Don DeLillo, whose novel White Noise reads
like a primer on the French theorist's writings. One motif in the novel
is a company called SIMUVAC, which stands for "simulated evacuation."
The [[company stages fake evacuations for a variety of
emergencies]{.mark}, including nuclear events, complete with a
[theatrical or cinematic set of special effects:]{.mark}]{.underline}
uniforms, sound effects, smells, and blood (if required). The firm turns
up several times in the novel but makes its first, and most satirically
poignant, appearance during an actual emergency. I[n perfect
Baudrillardian fashion, the company, which [operates solely with and
for]{.mark} simulation, uses a live emergency to practice (or simulate)
its own [simulated emergencies,]{.mark} which is the commodity it
packages and sells to various government agencies.]{.underline}

The protagonist of the novel asks a SIMUVAC employee, in the midst of
the actual crisis, to evaluate their rehearsal. The SIMUVAC operative
replies in darkly comedic fashion: The insertion curve isn't as smooth
as we would like. There's a prob- ability excess. [Plus which we don't
have our victims laid out where we we'd want them if this was an actual
simulation. In other words we're forced to take our victims where we
find them. We didn't get a jump on computer traffic. Suddenly it just
spilled out, three-dimensionally, all over the landscape. You have to
make allowances for the fact that everything we see tonight is real.
There's a lot of polishing to do. But that's what this exercise is all
about.]{.underline} (DeLillo, 1985: 139)

The [passage contains]{.underline} beautiful parodic [examples of the
vagaries that language suffers at the hands of bureaucrats,]{.underline}
with nonsense phrases passing as technical jargon, including "insertion
curve" and "probability excess," as well as the delightfully oxymoronic
"actual simulation." But beyond this parody, [DeLillo evokes the
[technicity of thought deeply embedded]{.mark} in Cold War America, the
same technicity that Baudrillard works through at multiple levels, to
[reveal the deep investment in the power]{.mark} and control
[afforded]{.mark} by simulation]{.underline}. The [[desirable
element]{.mark} of simulation is]{.underline}, in fact,
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as with body placement, which is
[something actual disasters arrange without care or consultation with
the modelers.]{.underline} When the SIMUVAC employee claims that things
are in need of "polishing" because "[everything we see tonight is real,"
we [witness the retreat into the comfortable delusion afforded by
simulation despite its]{.mark} no-nonsense [claims to]{.mark} hard-nosed
[pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline} -- "that's what this exercise is all
about," he asserts. SIMUVAC, as a company, [markets readiness, the
capacity to make a community alert and prepared, but can only deliver on
this promise as long as everything remains contained in the
model]{.underline}. (And if events do not remain neatly in the model,
then the [[company can use the "accident" to better refine their
simulation]{.mark} and techniques]{.underline}.) The same is true of
governments, and this is the [fear of the accident -- and the fear the
accident manifests --]{.underline} that Baudrillard (pace Paz) analyzes.
Every sector of [[Integral Reality lives in fear of events because they
can "spill out]{.mark}, three-dimensionally, all over the landscape," no
longer in control of the system. All that various institutions, systems,
and technologies promise to contain refuses to be
contained]{.underline}. Such is the revenge of the object, about which
Baudrillard writes, and the [intractability of that which lies outside
the systems of transparency and integration. [Death stalks the
protective simulating enterprises]{.mark} from inside and
out.]{.underline}

Baudrillard as a stylist of considerable skill and a rhetorician
well-steeped in the rhetorical tradition similarly mobilizes his writing
itself as Death in relation to the systems operative within academic
discourse. From the late 1960s on, his writings and books have deviated
rather widely from the conventions of sociological or philosophical
genres and academic writing by reaching into the humanistic essay
tradition (long since abandoned) and combin- ing it with the most
current of pressing issues. What [constitutes a standard
argument]{.underline} within the humanities and qualitative social
sciences, what [passes for [knowledge]{.mark} and knowledge formation
and construction, [depends heavily on the adherence of a given
work]{.mark} to these conventions.]{.underline} Baudrillard's [textual
[Deaths provide "fatal strategies]{.mark}" intended to stave off the
actual death of thought that can result from routinized]{.underline},
by-the-number, knowledge forma- tion. The [aphoristic style, borrowed
most directly from Nietzsche, works in a nonlinear fashion that
nonetheless makes consistent and sustained arguments]{.underline} across
his books as well as within them. Baudrillard teases an idea, settles on
a problematic, and pulls at its various permutations, checking how it
might work from one context to another. As a result, his writing can be
simultaneously readable and enjoyable while also being difficult and
frustrating. Like his friend Virilio, [he does not develop his argument
in a full or linear fashion, instead allowing for fragments, tangents,
and hyperbole to carry thought off course and place readers in a textual
space that is comfortable]{.underline} (especially if they have read
nineteenth- century philosophers) and discomfiting at the same time.

To this end, [he [resurrects outmoded philosophical discourse]{.mark}
while at the same time adding to it a late modernist poetic sensibil-
ity]{.underline}. The latter quality emerges most obviously in his
deployment of terms as talismans of the moment of writing as well as
terrain them- selves for inquiry: the [strategic [deployment of
labels]{.mark} and phrases intended to make us [pay attention to their
elasticity]{.mark} and formidable ability to fascinate]{.underline},
illuminate, and [instantiate a stability of unsta- ble
phenomena.]{.underline} Baudrillard is always contemporary, his thoughts
being solidly grounded in the present, and his terminology is always
embedded in the current moment. He relies on older essayistic forms to
structure his thoughts and musings, which often appear as thoughts and
musings, i.e. slightly inchoate and coming into focus through the act of
writing. The [processual quality of his style injects Death as that
which cannot be represented adequately into the deathly regimes of
academic language meted out by rote adherence to genre-driven formulae
within academic discursive practices.]{.underline} In an important
sense, [Baudrillard posits that [Death is the salva- tion of theory
while also arguing for the salvation that is Death]{.mark}]{.underline}.
With the nuclear sword of Damocles dangling over our heads ever since
the explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [we have slipped into a
constant state of imminent [global death that no longer seems like
death]{.mark}, so swift and horrible will it be that it outstrips our
imagination]{.underline}. "If the bomb drops," he writes in America, "we
shall neither have the time to die nor any awareness of dying" (42).
Echoing the neo-Freudian psychoanalyst Ernst Becker, [Baudrillard argues
that [Death ostensibly has been removed from our horizon]{.mark} in the
American Era, and we, those who follow in America's global footsteps,
have moved easily and subtly into a state of daily ease and material
comfort, buffeted and protected by a staggering array of
tele-technologies]{.underline}, opto-electronics, and international
ballistic mis- siles all meant to [[keep Death at bay and survival at
the forefront]{.underline}.]{.mark} Lost in this heady combination of
technological, intellectual, and economic materiel mounted for sheer
survival, of course, is life (43). [Only that which is alive can
die,]{.underline} and our cocooned embrace of globalization, which in
turn cocoons and embraces us, leaves us with an existence that recalls
the prescient horror films of George Romero begun early in the Cold War:
[an [existence like that of zombies,]{.mark} neither alive nor dead, but
frantically and brainlessly consuming all in sight.]{.underline}

[Baudrillard rescues Death from its purgatorial condition of "the not
alive" or mere survival]{.underline}. And in order to do so, he takes
his cue from the masses who are the targets of this weaponry and way of
life, the [[enactors of]{.mark} this ethos [of bland]{.mark} avoidance
and unthink- ing [consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their [wholesale
passivity to the apparatus of survival -- from nuclear bunkers to Star
Wars -- emerges from a [weariness of having been ceaselessly confronted
with apocalyptic visions]{.mark}]{.underline} since the first nuclear
explosions in New Mexico and Japan, and they "defend themselves with a
lack of imagination" (America, 44). "The masses' silent indifference to
nuclear pathos (whether it comes from the nuclear powers or from
antinuclear campaigners) is therefore a great sign of hope," he asserts,
"and a political fact of great import" (44). To [understand Death as
imma- nent within the system and without it, as [immanent within bios
and zoe]{.mark} and without it, is to resist the simulation of Death
that hovers over our heads in the Cold War and the War on Terror. The
salvation of Death, which is also the salvation of Baudrillard's
writing, thought, and analyses, provides us with the means of getting
this specific brutal excess back into our collective frame of reference,
not for the sake of nihilism, but to [resist the nihil- ism built into
all the projects of utter completion and realization that have rendered
politi]{.mark}cs, the subject, the object, thought, and theory as
[simulation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

War: From Clausewitz to Baudrillard, Millennium: Journal of
International Studies 2015, Vol. 43(2) KZaidi

We have also argued, however, that [contemporary
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} (particularly in NATO countries)
[[can]{.mark} alternatively [be understood]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
through the type of 'war' their ontology implies (war-as-fighting), but
rather [[through various operational procedures]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Our point has been to [suggest that [there is little or no
symbolism]{.mark} left [in]{.mark} a [warfare which processes targets as
spreadsheets]{.mark}, target packages and tasking-orders, [through a
predetermined rhythm of meetings]{.mark}]{.underline} which leads it,
[[not to a battlefield, but]{.mark} to an administrative
[model]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [model finds its ontology in
Baudrillard]{.underline} rather than in Clausewitz. [Through military
operations we move from war as antagonistic exchange between subjects,
to war as tech- nical realisation.]{.underline} The race between
targeting process and battle-rhythm resolves subjec- tivity, the [Other
and [symbolic exchange through the repetition of operational
procedures]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [not an example of
war-as-fighting, but the [enactment of a pre-planned
script]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[characteristic]{.mark} is by no
means exclusive to the targeting process; rather it [is indicative of
how military planning is conducted]{.mark} in most NATO countries. It is
therefore crucial to think of disappearance -- [enabled and exacerbated
by the way warfare is infinitely repeated]{.mark} -- as an integral part
of thinking about an ontology of war.]{.underline}

However, if [target-processing and associated ways of [operationalising
warfare is making war]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Clausewitzean sense
[[disappear]{.underline}]{.mark}, then why is [warfare made to appear as
fighting]{.underline}? We are [constantly immersed in 'war' through
television, art, computer games, military recruiting campaigns, and arms
industry projects]{.underline}. They [[call forth 'war' as antag-
onistic and generative exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consider the
(simulated) [fighting between warriors]{.underline} in the stream of
screenings that [includes Spartacus,]{.underline} 300, Troy, Braveheart,
Apocalypto, or The Last Samurai. [[Computer games centred on war and
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Civilization, Hearts of Iron, Total War
-- unfol[d through the idea that war is a struggle between antagonistic
forms of political life]{.underline}. Andreas Behnke argues (correctly
in our view) that the [Western [notion of war has lost its ontological
grounding]{.mark}. He reads this as part of a paradox since despite its
loss, warfare needs to be aestheticised and legitimised 'beyond the
purely instrumental']{.underline}.68 The explanation for why this is the
case often lies precisely in the way representation helps to [[reinforce
and militarise society]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it justifies a liberal
world order.69 Arguably, this [explanation eschews the prior question of
why the [study of war needs to imagine an antagonistic]{.mark} and
[generative war]{.mark} in the first pla]{.underline}ce. What does the
idea that war is antagonistic and generative obscure? Or put more
crudely, [who gains from reifying war as 'war', or
war-as-fighting?]{.underline}

As [an attempt to answer this we complement the prior explanation by
suggesting that recent theories of '[war' have underplayed the way in
which operational warfare is also]{.mark},]{.underline} in and of
itself, [an act of [disappearance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In doing so,
[they overemphasise genesis at the expense of
disappearance,]{.underline} and [obscure the loss of
exchange]{.underline} and subjectivity from the 'war' they claim to
depict, at the same time as they feed from its reification as such. This
'[war' allows NATO's member countries to send out war correspondents in
body armour and helmets; to give first person shooters like Battlefield
enough status as reality;]{.underline} to give movies like Hurt-locker,
television dramas like Generation Kill, and documentaries like Armadillo
their necessary ontological back-drop. Moreover, [it is [there to allow
for spend- ing vertiginous amounts of money on recruitment,]{.mark} arms
production, government transi- tions,]{.underline} advertising, aid,
education and -- last but not least -- military operations and
target-processing. Crucially, '[[war' is there to allow the researcher
to study war in peace]{.mark}. All of us who feed from this are part of
an extreme reification of war -- which hides not only that '[war' may
have ceased to be a meaningful]{.mark} term which structures reality,
but also that these [renditions of war is the closest we have to
'war']{.mark}]{.underline} as it is described by Clausewitz. The
ontology of war debates in which we engage are therefore part of this
reification of war.

In this way, the [distinction between an act of warfare and the attempt
to understand wars' underlying principles is lost]{.underline} through
the notion of war-as-fighting. [[Every attempt to wage war or think war
in its own right]{.underline}]{.mark} (or to oppose or neglect war for
that matter) [[refers back to this loss of meaning]{.mark} and
distinction]{.underline}. Understood in this way, the [[focus of
research on the ontology of war]{.mark} or on better understanding 'war'
as an object]{.underline} (to make it appear as meaningful), also
[[bestows a reality to the attempts to deal with
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [ques- tion of whether the notion of war
as antagonistic and generative exchange is real is therefore not the
issue, as any ontology of war risks this type of
reification.]{.underline} Rather, [we should ask why [it might seem so
costly to leave this particular ontology behind]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Could it be because the [various ways of grappling with war's ontology
are active parts of how this reality remains intact?]{.underline}

Should we (and [could we) forget the reality of 'war']{.underline}?
Moreover, [[is a world without referents like 'war' a world with less
violence]{.mark}? No, says Baudrillard, it is not:]{.underline} '\[t\]he
immanence of the death of all the great referents \... is expressed by
exacerbating the forms of violence and representation that characterized
them'.70 This helps us understand why, paradoxically, [in an era in
which war-as-fighting has disappeared, [we all speak about it, analyse
it,]{.mark} play it on our computers and experience it through books and
films -- and why a calling for war studies is a logical step in the
disappearance of war- as-fighting.]{.underline} This argument could be
directed against other disciplines too -- 'war' is not a privileged
object in any respect. Nonetheless, [[to call for a renewed discipline
of 'war studies']{.mark} -- encouraging as it may be, especially to all
of us who receive research funding based on the existence of such a
discipline -- [is]{.mark} therefore [not without
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is not so much a call for an
understanding of war as it is a call to supplant the absence of war in
International Relations with a particular categorical blindness, since
strictly speaking war is never there. Rather, it [provides a 'simulation
of perspective']{.underline} as Baudrillard would call it.71 The
[problem is that the [organised violence]{.mark} to which we constantly
refer [has no other reality than that of the model]{.mark}.72 That is,
it has no other reality than the reality pro- vided by representations
of war]{.underline} (which is not to say that they are one and the
same). Through this simulation, [war returns as an imperative to
thought. It is an explanation or an understanding through a particular
category]{.underline} ('war') and not of a state of things (actions,
reactions, challenges, automatism, repetition, processing). 'War' [works
as an imperative:]{.underline}

'You've got a military and you must learn how to use it well' 'You've
got a weapon-system and you must learn how to operate it' 'You've got a
target and you must learn how to task it' 'You've got an ontology of war
and you must learn how to think through it.'73

Conclusion

[[War is understood]{.mark} in recent debates]{.underline} on critical
war studies [[as characterised by antagonis- tic]{.mark} and generative
[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [amounts to a view in which 'war'
[helps provide a context in which acts of violence become
meaningful]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [[receive a pattern]{.mark},
reciprocity and a 'natural' demarcation that can be named and
criticised]{.underline}. This [article has argued that [contemporary
understandings of war]{.mark} and warfare are well [advised to find new
ontologies]{.mark} complementing the notion that war is
fighting]{.underline}. We have [presented one such attempt,]{.underline}
resonating [with Baudrillard's notion of war-processing, based on an
[analysis of the plan- ning]{.mark} and conduct of military
operations]{.underline} (in NATO countries). This [attempt outlines how
[warfare strives towards its own 'perfect']{.mark}]{.underline} and
self-referential [[model]{.underline}]{.mark}. We illustrate this
through an [analysis of [military targeting so as to point to how
warfare becomes a reitera- tive and automated process]{.mark} which
constructs a seamless economy of violence]{.underline}. We read
[[targeting as a perpetual motion to keep up with the battle-rhythm of
military operations]{.mark} and argue that it rids what is termed 'war'
of its underlying principles: adversaries, antag- onism and
exchange.]{.underline}

An [[understanding of war]{.mark} which [neglects this aspect]{.mark}
risks missing that war]{.underline} (as pro- cessing) [strictly speaking
lacks an antagonistic engagement with 'an enemy']{.underline} and in so
doing [calls into question many of the [underlying principles that the
notion of war- as-fighting rests upon]{.mark}.]{.underline} Doing so
leaves the theorist of war and IR with a blind spot: the [[conception of
'war']{.mark} that has [become operational]{.mark} while being [obscured
by the reification of 'war']{.mark} as fighting.]{.underline} Barkawi
and Brighton associate the absence of a discipline of war studies with
an 'othering of violence from inquiry'.74 We again state explicitly,
there- fore, that we [are not advocating the continuation of such
othering. [To say that war as processing lacks antagonism is not to say
that it lacks violence]{.mark}. Warfare is a highly violent practice but
it seems to [occur amidst a breakdown of symbolic relations]{.mark}
between a subject and an Other. This would point to acts of insurgency
or terror being ways of acting out, rather than a response as such.75
[The 'perfect war' we have described is highly violent indeed -- but
that does not make it 'fighting'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is [not to say that war should be reduced to an automated process
between man and machine. Rather we want to point out that
[war-as-fighting neglects the way in which
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}, symbolism and exchange are [often
[lacking in military targeting]{.mark} -- something which needs to be
considered if we are to better understand the relationship between the
ontic realty of warfare and the ontology of war.]{.underline} In light
of our argument, [the ontology of war can be read not only as a way of
thinking 'war' but also as an imperative to thought. We are aware that
this imperative does not work through simple causality]{.underline}. The
targeting doctrines we have looked at are not representative of all
warfare. A [task for future research would be to contrast it to, for
example, the way 'insurgents' or 'civilians' sub- jected to military
violence represent warfare. Another would be to examine disappear- ance
in the wider contexts of counter-insurgency and network-centric
warfare.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [there is a risk that (critical) war studies in invoking
the ontology of war- as-fighting is led back to an antagonistic and
generative exchange between subjects]{.underline} -- whether this is
actually taking place or not. [[Attempts to think of politics]{.mark},
ethics, security or gender [risk being forced through the mould of this
particular ontology of]{.mark} war]{.underline}. Following Baudrillard,
[an [attempt]{.mark} to rethink and complement the ontology of war
[should challenge it in a way that forces its 'truth to withdraw]{.mark}
-- just as if one were [pulling the chair out from under someone]{.mark}
about to sit down'.]{.underline}76 We therefore [need to think war in a
way that pulls the chair out from underneath the gamer, policy maker,
military officer or theorist about to sit down to 'do war'. What does
this act of 'pulling the chair' from underneath thought leave us with?
Our hope is that it [opens up for the possibility of rethinking
ontologies of war]{.mark} in a fashion that helps us better understand
and challenge their relationship to various ontic realities. Taking this
question seriously [gives us a new vantage point on (critical) war
studies]{.mark} for future debates.]{.underline}

[[**Serious games** are]{.mark} a fascinating [next stage in the]{.mark}
continuous [**exploitation of digital media** technologies]{.mark} over
the last decades [for]{.mark} training, [learning, and
education]{.mark}.]{.underline} As formal [education and training always
[involves]{.mark} the transmission and [repetition of]{.mark} certain
**[culturally]{.mark} and socially [specific sets]{.mark}** [of skills
and moral **values**]{.mark}]{.underline}, it would be of paramount
importance to ensure that developments within [the [serious
gaming]{.mark} industry are in step with]{.underline} the effects of the
good intentions of [[nurtur]{.mark}ing [people within a]{.mark} social
[framework that **emphasises**]{.mark} **a [fair]{.mark}, culturally
[diverse]{.mark}, and blooming [society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this
light, it is interesting that from the very advent of the information
society, [digital technologies have been depicted as central to the
development of a more **just and equal society**]{.underline} by
harbouring the promise of [bridging gaps between classes, races, and
genders locally as well as globally]{.underline}. Driven by the vision
of this utopian potential of new technologies, [the education industry
and larger policy organisations have been exploring the **pedagogical
possibilities of these technologies** both in- and outside the
traditional classroom for the last twenty-five years.]{.underline}
Indeed, the [implementation of increasingly more sophisticated and
technologically mediated methods and tools for learning and education,
takes as its starting point the techno-utopian **assumption that (new)
interactive technologies themselves are the primary harbingers of a fair
and blooming society** through **facilitating (student)
empowerment**]{.underline}. This paper takes issue with this widespread
techno-utopian perspective by seeking to shed light on the larger
ethical implications of serious gaming. It will do so through
foregrounding the [relationship between global injustices, and the
aesthetic properties and discourses of serious gaming]{.underline}. So
while reframing serious games themselves in a new ethical perspective
constitutes the main objective of this paper, [[it is]{.mark} equally
[important to situate serious games within a **larger**]{.mark}
**political [discourse on the teaching of new
skills]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Firstly then, [[policy papers]{.mark} and
academic studies on serious games all **[display an assumption
of]{.mark} the [inherent neutrality]{.mark}** of gaming technologies,
**[as if these technologies were]{.mark} mere tools [equally suitable
for all.]{.mark}**]{.underline} What also becomes apparent in the
language used in these studies and proposals, is how [[this
instrumentalist vision]{.mark} of gaming technologies for learning [goes
hand in hand with]{.mark} a particular [**neo-liberal assumption of what
constitutes a fit individual**, and]{.mark} by extension of
[what]{.mark} the **hallmarks of [a 'healthy' society may
be.]{.mark}**]{.underline} For instance, in the European Union study
**["Serious Gaming -- a fundamental building block to drive the
knowledge work society]{.underline}**" by Manuel Oliveira on the merits
of serious games for education, [justification runs along the lines of
gaming 'encouraging **risk-taking and a winning attitude' and [creating
a 'performance-oriented individual]{.mark}**]{.underline}.' Similarly,
Michael Guerena from [the US **[Orange County Department of Education
proposes]{.mark}** in one of the Department's web-casts **[that serious
games instil "twenty-first century skills" like risk-taking,
adaptability]{.mark}, self-direction, interactive communication, and
['planning and managing]{.mark} for results' [in the students]{.mark}
through the "channelling of fun.**"]{.underline} Likewise, the UK-based
Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association last year
published their white paper Unlimited learning - Computer and video
games in the learning landscape, in which they argue that [[serious
games will "create]{.mark} an engaged, knowledgeable, critical and
enthusiastic [citizenry" whose "work practices will be **geared towards
networked communication**]{.mark} and distributed
collaboration"]{.underline} (49). [Concerns around the **ethical
implications of serious games** regarding their entanglements with
larger social (gendered, classed, and raced) inequalities have until now
largely been coined in terms of game content or
representation.]{.underline} In a recent case in Singapore, the
government's proposition of using the RPG Granado Espada in secondary
school history classes was followed by an outcry from various local
academics condemning the stereotypical characters and simplistic
representation of medieval Europe in the game. Likewise, various authors
have critiqued current serious games not only because of simplistic
representation of characters and surroundings, but especially because
**[[simulations]{.mark} generally [tend to oversimplify complex social
problems]{.mark} and situations.]{.underline}** Gibson, Aldrich, and
Prensky's Games and Simulations in Online Learning (vi - xiv) for
instance discuss these demerits of serious games. While such a critical
analysis of how [game content [contributes to the reproduction of
dominant discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} is definitely helpful, I would
argue that the aesthetics of serious games involve much more than mere
content. Instead, this paper will argue that [[the]{.mark} formal [quest
for instantaneity]{.mark} that research around digital media has
displayed through the development of interactive technologies for
education [is]{.mark} already itself **[by no means a neutral
affair.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This is because **[[the discourses that
inform this quest]{.mark} and that accompany this search for
instantaneity arguably [enforce the hegemony of a militaristic]{.mark},
masculinist, humanist, and of what I will call a '[speed-elitist'
individual]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, I suggest that the
propensity of current games to have sexist or racist content, is merely
symptomatic of gaming technology's larger problematic in terms of the
aesthetic of instantaneity. In short, (serious) computer games have
**[[become archives of]{.mark} the [discursive]{.mark} and actual
[violence carried out in the name of the]{.mark} utopia of technological
progress and instantaneity [under]{.mark} neo-liberal [globalisation.
This]{.mark} archival function [is possible]{.mark} exactly [because
cybernetic technologies promise]{.mark} the containment and [control
of]{.mark} such supposedly accidental [violence, while in fact
exacerbating these]{.mark} forms of violence]{.underline}**. This leads
me to conclude that such **[violence is in fact structural to new
serious gaming technologies, rather than accidental]{.underline}**. I
will elaborate this hypothesis by looking at various theorists who seek
to understand this structural imperative of new technologies, and their
relationship to the neo-liberalisation of learning and education. In
turn, I will look at how this problematic structural logic informs the
two popular serious games Real Lives and Global Warming Interactive.
Secondly, [the advent of [serious gaming]{.mark} interestingly [runs
parallel with]{.mark} the **contemporary dissemination and
virtualisation of traditional learning institutions** into
cyberspace.]{.underline} While the existence of learning tools in other
areas of society besides actual learning institutions has been a fact
since the advent of schools, the shift of methods of learning into
online and digital tools is symptomatic of the [decentralisation of
power from 'old' educational institutions and its usurpation into
**instantaneous neo-liberal modes of production**]{.underline}. I am
summarising the work of Bill Readings on the university here, because it
sheds light on [the shift in education tout court **towards
virtualisation**, and its relationship to [the '**new hegemony of
instantaneity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.']{.mark} In The University in
Ruins, Readings argues that [the shift from the state-run university of
reason and culture to the present-day **global knowledge enterprise**
must mean that **the centre of power in effect has shifted**
elsewhere.]{.underline} More important, says Readings, is that **[the
funct[ion of the new 'university of excellence,']{.mark} one that
successfully transforms it into yet another trans-national corporation,
[relies on the fantasy that the university is]{.mark} still that
[transcendental]{.mark} university of culture [in service of the state
and its citizens.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [So the invocation of the
**[fantasy of a]{.mark}n 'originary' [university]{.mark}** of reason and
progress, [that produces **unbiased knowledge**]{.mark} for the good of
all, [facilitates]{.mark} the **[doubling of the production]{.mark}** of
information **into other spaces** outside the university walls
proper.]{.underline} While Readings surely discusses only higher
education institutions in The University in Ruins, I would argue that
the logic of a shifting centre of power from the state into the
technocratic networks and nodes of speed operates quite similarly in the
case of primary, secondary, and other types of formal education. Indeed,
**[the current [virtualisation of learning]{.mark} and the emphasis on
lifelong learning [marks a dispersal of traditional learning
institutions]{.mark} into online spaces]{.underline}**. This
**[dispersal [works]{.mark} increasingly [in service of the
'speed-elite']{.mark} rather than simply in service of the
nation-state.]{.underline}** The [heralding of [serious
games]{.mark}]{.underline} for education [[can]{.mark} therefore [be
read as a symptom of]{.mark} the **intensified reach** of the
imperatives of neo-liberal [globalisation]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which
**[consumption enters the lives of locally bound as well as more mobile
cosmopolitan citizens of all ages through harping on the technological
possibility of the confusion of production and play.]{.underline}**
Through the imperative of play then, [production increasingly and
diffusely colonises all niche times and -spaces of neo-liberal
society]{.underline}. In other words, (the emphasis on) [play allows
**not only a potential [increase in production]{.mark}** and consumption
[through the citizen-consumer after]{.mark} her or his **formal
[education of 'skills]{.mark}'**, but starkly **intensifies flows of
production and consumption** already at the very moment of
learning]{.underline}. While such an integration of play and production
is generally understood within the framework of the neo-liberal demand
for the circulation of pleasure, [it is useful here to]{.underline}
widen the scope from [[understand]{.mark}ing [the learner as
**a**]{.mark} **mere [consumer of pleasure]{.mark}** into the larger set
of problematic interpellations that **[marks subjugation in contemporary
society]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Intriguingly, a host of research has
emerged over the past years pointing towards the intricate relationship
between subjugation, military research objectives, and videogame
development. Such research suggests an **[intimate connection between
the C3I logic and humanist militaristic [utopias of
transcendence]{.mark}, which [incriminates interactive technologies
as]{.mark} inherently [favouring]{.mark} culturally [particular notions
of personhood]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the case of computer- and
video-games for entertainment, researchers have argued that the
[aesthetic properties of gaming technologies [give rise to]{.mark}
so-called '**[militarised masculinity]{.mark}**.']{.underline} In
"Designing Militarized Masculinity," Stephen Kline, Nick DyerWitheford,
and Greig de Peuter argue for instance that interactive games **[[open
up]{.mark} very specific [subject positions that "mobilize fantasies of
instrumental domination]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (255). [This specific
mobilisation that video-games invoke, is not only due to the remediation
of violent television- and film- content, but also due to the **intimate
connection between gaming- and military industries**]{.underline} which
grant these technologies their particular cybernetic aesthetic
properties (see also Herz 1997). **[This element of militarisation
partly informs my concept of 'speed-elitism.']{.underline}** I
extrapolate the idea of 'speed-elitism' largely from the works of John
Armitage on the discursive and technocratic machinery underlying current
neo-liberal capitalism. In "Dromoeconomics: Towards a Political Economy
of Speed," Armitage and Phil Graham suggest that due to [the capitalist
need for the production of excess, there is a [strong relationship
between]{.mark} the forces of exchange and [production, and]{.mark} the
logic of [speed]{.mark}.]{.underline} In line with Virilio's argument in
Speed and Politics, they argue that [various formerly the [less
connected **social areas**]{.mark} **of war, communication,
entertainment, and trade**, [are now **intimately**]{.mark} **though
obliquely connected**]{.underline}. This is because all [[these]{.mark}
forces [mutually enforce one another through]{.mark} the **technological
usurpation and [control of space]{.mark}** []{.mark}(and territory), and
through the **compression and regulation of time.**]{.underline}
Eventually, Armitage and Graham suggest that "**[[circulation has become
an]{.mark} essential process of capitalism, an [end in
itself]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (118) and therefore [any form of
[cultural production]{.mark} increasingly [finds itself tied-up in this
logic]{.mark}.]{.underline} So neo-liberal capitalism is a system within
which [the most intimate and fundamental aspects of human social life --
in particular, forms of [**communication and play** -- get]{.mark} to be
formally **[subsumed under capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In "Resisting
the Neoliberal Discourse of Technology," Armitage elaborates on this
theme of circulation by pointing out that [the current mode of
late-[capitalism relies on the]{.mark} **continuous extension and
validation** of the infrastructure and the **[neutral or optimistic
discourses of]{.mark} the [new information
technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Discourses
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [typically [get repeated]{.mark} -- like in
the policy papers -- in favour of the emerging speed-elite [are **those
of connection, empowerment and progress**, which]{.mark} often [go hand
in hand with]{.mark} the [celebration of]{.mark} highly **mediated
[spaces for action]{.mark}** and communication]{.underline}. **[[Such
discourses]{.mark} however [suppress the violent colonial]{.mark} and
patriarchal [history of those technological spaces]{.mark} and the
subsequent unevenness brought about by and occurring within these
spaces.]{.underline}** I would claim that Armitage's assessment of
accelerated circulation, and the way [new technologies make play
**complicit in the techno-utopian endeavour** of speed, is crucial for
understanding the larger ethical issues surrounding serious
games.]{.underline} It is helpful at this point to look at Paul
Virilio's and Jacques Derrida's work because this helps us understand
the [complicity of the aesthetics of interactive and visually oriented
gaming technologies in speed-elitism]{.underline}. In "Cyberwar, God,
and Television," Paul Virilio talks about the [simulation industry's
function of "exposing \[one\] to the accident in order not to be exposed
to it"]{.underline} (322). What is according to him 'accidented' through
the virtualisation of accidents and violence, for instance in
video-games, is reality itself. This '[accident of reality' that
virtuality]{.underline} brings about, argues Virilio, **[is due to the
fact that [simulation technologies fragment space through]{.mark} their
property of instantaneous [connection with previously far-away
places]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The hallmark of this
fragmentation is therefore that **[it brings about an intensification of
forms of in- and exclusion through actual disconnection. Eventually,
[there will be "two realities: the actual and the
virtual]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (323), and I would claim that
consequently **[the privileged [speed-elite will]{.mark} be able to
[live in the illusion of engaging with social reality]{.mark} that the
virtual grants, [at the cost of]{.mark} the [(s)lower classes who will
suffer]{.mark} the social and ecological effects of the accidents of
[virtualisation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The illusion of
mastery]{.underline} for Virilio [consists in]{.underline} the sense of
the "**[incorporation of the world within oneself" that "real time
technologies permit]{.underline}**" (328) **[due to their militaristic
[compulsion]{.mark} that [seeks to "reduce the world to]{.mark} the
point where one could [possess it]{.mark}]{.underline}**["]{.mark}
(329). I maintain that [these statements spell out exactly the function
and logic of serious gaming.]{.underline} Virilio elaborates the idea of
the 'museum of accidents' later in his infamously apocalyptic "The
Museum of Accidents." His evaluation of certain [visual simulation
technologies as 'museums of accidents']{.underline} and in particular in
how these accidents **[involve the increasing stratification of
individuals within a new global imperative of speed,]{.underline}**
resonates well with Jacques Derrida's work on the 'archiving' properties
of new technologies and their implications. In Monolingualism of the
Other, or The Prosthesis of Origin, Derrida parallels the concept and
the technique of memory and archiving with these new technologies. He
argues that [the tragedy of the disappearance of various cultures calls
forward a desire in the R&D community -- like teachers and developers of
serious games -- to prevent this from happening by using the immense
possibilities of presentday archiving technologies.]{.underline}
However, he cautions that [this [scientific quest to]{.mark} rescue
through [archiving]{.mark} languages and [cultures]{.mark} from going
extinct **due to ongoing globalisation processes**, once more
**presupposes that cultures and peoples are pre-given static entities**,
or simple identities, that **can then be simply 'stored'**.]{.underline}
Moreover, **[it falsely [presupposes that archiving technologies are
neutral tools,]{.mark} as well as that the ideology behind this
archiving desire is a universal or neutral one]{.underline}**. But since
[the very [technicity of archiving is]{.mark} one that is already
[entangled with]{.mark} the **same [dominant culture]{.mark}** that
archives, the necessary translation or recognition of materials fit for
archiving **will have as its logical parameters this dominant culture.
This kind of messianistic desire, as much as the quest for
[understanding the other]{.mark} (or rather, the claim that one does
empathise with and understand the other), [is]{.mark} therefore actually
a violent, [neocolonialist,]{.mark} and possessive sort of
encapsulation**]{.underline}. Similarly, the **[well-intended
pedagogical aim to 'salvage otherness' from the tragedy of disappearance
under globalisation works completely in accordance with that very
tragedy]{.underline}**. One could compare this well-intended
[encapsulation for instance with the anthropological display of
artefacts of certain cultures in Western museums.]{.underline} It may be
far more important to save actual humans than to salvage, understand,
and store their perceived culture or language, and Derrida warns that
the choice for one generally does not imply a choice for the other.
**[[This 'virtual empathy']{.mark} that new simulation technologies
endow, which sadly [works in accordance with the 'structural
accident']{.mark} of disenfranchisement under neoliberal globalisation,
is indeed present in the aesthetic of many serious games currently
available]{.underline}**. The widely praised and sympathetic game Real
Lives is a good example of this. The pedagogical objective of Real
Lives, as its website declares, is [to "learn how people really live in
other countries."]{.underline} The producers maintain that Real Lives is
[an "empathy-building world" which will grant the students an
"appreciation of their own culture and the cultures of other
peoples."]{.underline} The game opens with assigning a character who
just got born at any place in the world to the player. Since the
attribution of the character is based on actual statistical
possibilities of place of birth and economic status, the character has a
high propensity of being born poor in countries like India, Mexico, or
in other highly populated places. During the course of the game, the
player can take actions like deciding to go to school or staying home to
help her/his parents, which hobbies to take up, what job to take, and so
forth. The game time takes one-year leaps in which the player can see
the outcome of outside events, like disease or floods, and of his or her
own actions. The software shows a map of the character's birth region
and its statistics, like population density, gross annual income,
currency, health standards, and etcetera. The character is also assigned
traits, like happiness, athleticism, musicality, health, and so on.
While the player's actions definitely influence the health and economic
status of the played character and her family, the potentially
interesting part of the game lies in the fact that events and situations
that are ostensibly beyond the player's control influence the outcomes.
[Such a [game structure]{.mark} potentially [endows the student
with]{.mark} a sense that simple [meritocratic discourses]{.mark} are
flawed]{.underline}. However, what is also obvious in Real Lives, is
that [the attribution based on statistical facts may very easily lead to
a simplistic view of a country and its inhabitants.]{.underline} While
India for instance surely has many poor people and girls often are not
allowed to go to school, **[to have the student chance time and again on
these representations can [easily lead to]{.mark} the [repetition of
stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}** and a failure to grasp the complexity
of Indian society. [More serious however is the formal technological
mode of objectification and its distancing effects that the game
generates]{.underline}. This objectification resides in how the 'clean'
interface -- the 'flight simulator' like visual layout on the screen
with the overview of categories and character attributes, the major
actions and events in the character's life induced at the stroke of a
few keys -- in reality grants the player a sense of control by engaging
with a machine programmed in such a way that [it [appears to let the
student identify with]{.mark} and act out his or her [empathy]{.mark}
vis-à- vis a 'real' child in need.]{.underline} This discursive
confusion of reality and virtuality is for instance also present in the
web-game Darfur Is Dying, in which the player and virtual character get
confused through the problematic claim that you can "start your
experience (as a refugee)" and that it offers a "glimpse of what it is
like" (emphases mine) to be a refugee. At the same time, the actual
children in need on the ground disappear from the player's radar,
turning them into a distant and vague large group of 'others' who are
effectively beyond the student's reach of immediate responsibility. As
Virilio suggests, **[the time spend through engaging in [virtual empathy
eclipses]{.mark} the ['real accidents' from the student's view]{.mark}
and experience]{.underline}**. What is more, Real Lives **[eclipses the
[larger social]{.mark} and economical [relationships]{.mark} between the
material production and consumption of such virtual engagement and the
continuous exploitation and 'museumising' of peoples on the brink of
(social, economical, and environmental) accident, disenfranchisement,
and even death]{.underline}**. While **[relatively [well-off
youth]{.mark} may [indulge in turning other peoples' distress into a
'fun' educational game]{.mark}, such indulgence is precisely based on a
neo-liberal structure that [exploits the environment]{.mark}, especially
of the poor, and allows [for]{.mark} the [outsourcing]{.mark} and
feminisation [of]{.mark} ever cheaper [third-world
labour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Derrida proposed, [the archiving into
visual technologies of certain cultures and peoples threatened with
extinction does not at all imply saving these actual people and their
cultures -- **in fact, it may very well do exactly the
opposite.**]{.underline} Long-term minor attitudinal changes in the
student notwithstanding, the [disconnecting properties of the new
cybernetic technologies of speed]{.underline} that Real Lives is part of
therefore **[displace the effect of the producer's and student's good
intentions]{.underline}** and empathy **[into an instantaneous
[technocratic violence that effectively 'plays with
lives]{.mark}.']{.underline}** Another telling example of this
displacement of well-intended interactive play is the environmental game
Global Warming Interactive -- CO2Fx. This web-based game, funded by the
United States National Science Foundation and developed by a group of
people from various American consultancies and educational
organisations, aims at teaching the student about the kinds of decision
making involved in global warming. The game invariably starts with a map
of the country of Brazil in the 1960s, and gives statistics about the
carbon emission, air temperature, and general welfare of the population.
The player can then control government budget expenditures for science,
agriculture, social services, and development initiatives, after which
the system jumps ten years into the future, generating results based on
these expenditures. The game eventually ends by showing the relative
increase in temperature in the virtual year of 2060, warning the player
that more international cooperation is required to really tackle global
warming. The major issue with Global Warming Interactive is once more
that it completely obscures the relationship between the computing
technology itself that allows the CO2Fx simulation, and global warming.
A telling moment of this dissimulation is when the game urges the player
to "switch off the television!" because television uses quite a bit of
energy, while the energy consumption of the infrastructure, mode of
production, student consumption, and tools that sustain the game itself
is being blissfully ignored. Armitage's claim that **[increasingly modes
of thought, learning, and exchange are formally subsumed under capital
through the new technological infrastructure certainly rings true
here]{.underline}**. [The game is also a stark simplification of **how
government decisions affect a complex issue** like climate change, and
is fraught with problematic and often **techno-utopian assumptions**
about how to tackle the climate change problem]{.underline}. A good
example of this assumption is the recurring recommendation throughout
the game to the player to spend more money on scientific research, as
this expenditure supposedly promises to solve or alleviate the warming
problem. [The speed-elitist, humanist, and techno-utopian discourses
that permeate American academia and consultancy firms are clearly
reflected]{.underline} in Global Warming Interactive, [leaving the
student inculcated with a **currently dominant belief system** that lies
precisely at the base of environmental pollution and economical
disenfranchisement that **urges certain groups** of poor people in a
country like Brazil to **survive on environmentally unfriendly business
solutions**]{.underline}, like slash-burning the forests. One is also
left to wonder why the game uses the country of Brazil in the first
place, and not the United States -- arguably the largest global polluter
today. There is indeed a problematic (neo)colonialist undertone to the
current one-country version of Global Warming Interactive. Extending the
content of the game, as the developers seeks to do, by including more
countries in the [simulation, would not alleviate this problem, but
would simply concur with the actual contemporary shift from previous
colonialist social hierarchies into speed-elitist
hierarchies]{.underline}. But more seriously, [giving the player
simulated government omnipotence]{.underline} through the Virilian
'museumisation' of the economical and social structures underlying
global warming in that 'other' country of Brazil, **[[grants]{.mark} a
[the player an illusion of mastering]{.mark} and of dealing
constructively with the major 'accident' of [climate change]{.mark} and
its impact on the (s)lower classes while actually fuelling
it.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, **[player or [student empathy is displaced
into instantaneous networks of]{.mark} ever increasing neo-liberal
[circulation]{.mark} and production.]{.underline}** Scholars like David
Leonard in "'Live in your world, play in ours?': Race, video games, and
consuming the other" and Lisa Nakamura in "Race in/for Cyberspace" have
in the past argued that many **[entertainment games contain elements of
racial and gendered stereotyping]{.underline}** allowing the gamer to
engage him or herself on the basis of what Nakamura calls 'identity
tourism' and Leonard calls 'blackface.' **[These [problematic modes of
(dis)identification allow the user]{.mark} not only to enter the game
via dominant modes of representation, but also [entail a form of 'safely
experiencing the other' through cybernetic technologies]{.mark}, where
the ([imagined) other]{.mark} effectively [becomes consumed
through]{.mark} the [high-tech prosthesis]{.mark} of the
self.]{.underline}** Neither Nakamura nor Leonard however elaborate how
and why this element of a 'safe prosthesis' appears to be a central
aesthetic of gaming technologies. After all, much [media content suffers
from stereotypical representation,]{.underline} and one could argue in
line with Derrida's Monolingualism of the Other that media are always
prostheses to the self. I would argue that what is specific about
serious gaming technologies that emerges from my interpretations of
Derrida's, Armitage's, and Virilio's assessments is [the **illusion of
control** by the self that these technologies facilitate, due to their
element of interactive instantaneity.]{.underline} It is the **[new
technologies' [aesthetic properties]{.mark} themselves -- rather than
simply a narrative and its repetition of dominant ideologies -- that
[grant a 'fantasy of connection]{.mark}, [wholeness, and mastery'
through interactivity]{.mark} as if it was an immediate and transparent
property of the gaming subject.]{.underline}** What is therefore at work
in serious games like Real Lives and Global Warming Interactive is a
form of double objectification. The illusion of constructive engagement
with a pressing social issue through these seemingly 'clean' and
'neutral' technologies, combined with the distancing effect brought
about by these technologies from their actual (social and environmental)
implications, [make the gamer complicit in the neo-liberal endeavour
that paradoxically precisely leads to contemporary speed-elitist
disenfranchisement]{.underline}. In short, interactive technologies like
serious games **[[bring about a displacement of good intentions through
claims of technological progress]{.mark} and empowerment for
all.]{.underline}** So despite (or perhaps because of) the good
intentions of game designers and publishers, [these games then in fact
exhibit the doubling of the colonialist logic that inspired humanist
narratives of progress]{.underline}. This doubling runs parallel to the
virtualisation of learning that is taking place under neo-liberal
globalisation and its speed-elitist modes of intensified in- and
exclusion this shift incurs. [These games can therefore]{.underline}, in
line with Virilio's argument, [be understood as attempts at (eventually
unsuccessfully) containing the accident of the real and its social
repercussions brought about by these technologies of speed]{.underline}.
To conclude, the development of serious games is implicated in what
Derrida in Monolingualism refers to as a 'disappearance' of those
cultures, idioms, and ways of being that do not conform to these
tightening particular hegemonic structures of acceleration.
**['[Healthy' personhood becomes singularly understood]{.mark} through a
restrictive and stratifying emphasis on mediated learning as more
pleasurable, as well as on humanistic character traits like creativity,
activity, risktaking, mediated empathy, mobility, and competitiveness,
as the rhetoric in policy papers and optimistic studies also
shows.]{.underline}** Such particular **[[valorisations]{.mark} are
problematic because they [recreate a meritocratic]{.mark}, masculinist,
militaristic, and [speed-elitist hierarchy between]{.mark} economically
as well as otherwise [diverse groups and communities]{.mark} within a
global community which [understands individuals]{.mark} solely [in terms
of active]{.mark} and productive [citizenship]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
line with this, [serious games themselves can in their very form be
understood as Virilian 'museums of accident.']{.underline} This **[means
that the virtualisation of social engagement and sense of social and
environmental 'accident control' that these games call forward is
obliquely yet intrinsically related to new modes of 'accidenting'
material reality.]{.underline}** This potentially **[disenfranchises
those who are not (positively) addressed within these properties of
subject-formation]{.underline}**, and leads to increasing levels of
stress and competitiveness in individuals and students as it becomes
progressively more imperative for individual survival to conform to the
demands of the speed-elite. Without doubt, this paper has analysed only
a few serious games currently available and surely more analyses need to
be conducted. I suggest nonetheless that since the problematic of speed,
which gives rise to double objectification, is structurally present in
all visual interactive technologies, it is by default at work in all
serious games. As I suggested at the start, the [pedagogical and ethical
enterprise of serious gaming is therefore serious indeed, as its
aesthetic properties become increasingly implicated in precisely the
opposite of what serious gaming promises to help make
possible]{.underline} -- the fair, culturally diverse, and blooming
society that we all want.

### Impact -- Code

#### In response the 1AC calls the bluff and pulls away the curtain. We are now witnessing the very liquidation being, of meaning, of thought. All are subordinated to the hyper-speed of the code through the worldwide nationalist machine fighting on an unlimited battlefield that always needs new recruits to fulfill the pornography of the image. Debate itself is engrossed in this very logic of the code. Rewarding us for participating in this hall of mirrors. Perpetuating the quest for the hero to spread light to the world, to wield the sword of goodness and pierce the image of the unknown.

**Pasco'16** -- Marc Oliver D. Pasco is Assistant Professor of
Philosophy in Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines. He wrote his
Master's thesis on Martin Heidegger's idea on \"wiederholung\" or
creative repetition. He is currently writing his doctoral dissertation
on the possible relation between Martin Heidegger's ideas on mortality
and Jean Baudrillard's notion of hyperreality. He has published several
articles on various thinkers like Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Kant, Habermas,
Heidegger and Plato. "From Objects to Being and Beyond" KZaidi

[[We exist in a world of excess]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[production
and reproduction]{.mark} of objects, information]{.underline} and ways
of life [[happens in hyper-speed]{.underline}]{.mark} due largely to the
availability of virtual platforms of transportation, communication and
exchange.  [The production and [reproduction of images]{.mark}, the
supposed [mirrors of the real]{.mark} has taken on a life of its own,
pushing mankind to a state of schizophrenic
hyper-awareness]{.underline}. The [[fulcrum of reality]{.mark} which was
once embedded in the indubitable foundation of subjective certainty
[disintegrates]{.mark} and gives way to the insurmountable [momentum of
hyperreality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Today, the [subjective and objective [poles of]{.mark} epistemological
[knowledge implode into]{.mark} a pure screen of the obscene, the
fractal, [the logic of the code]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
[illusion projected on to [the image rendering it a simulation]{.mark}
of the real to the mind of the [subject has transcended]{.mark} the
[limits]{.mark} of its intended definition. With the enigmatic
coagulation of the real and the virtual in technological media society,
[copies no longer signify anything beyond themselves. Reality and
simulacra become indistinguishable]{.mark}.]{.underline} The virtual's
[revelation of the fractal translates [Being itself into a
code]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a [replicable series of signifiers
that have lost their respective signifieds, rendering subjective belief
and knowledge moot and to a certain extent, pretentious.]{.underline} As
Baudrillard says, "It is no longer a question of imitation, nor of
reduplication, nor even of parody. [It is rather a question of
substituting signs of the real for the real itself; that is, an
operation to deter every real process by its operational double, a
metastable, programmatic, [perfect descriptive machine which provides
all the signs of the real]{.mark} and short-circuits all its
vicissitudes]{.underline}" (Ibid.: 170). [Simulacra represents the
obscene,]{.underline} it [reveals the genetic reproducibility of the
real]{.underline}, which [implodes the traditional conceptualization of
what it means to be.]{.underline} Through the translation of the
metaphysical into the fractal, the [[holographic derivation of
codes]{.mark} and models of reality through technological media
dislodges the ground of objectivity from the realm of subjectivity and
transfers all its power into the territory of pure
simulacra.]{.underline} It's not that there is nothing real. It's that
[there too much and too many of it]{.underline}. As Horrocks explains,
"The result of this [[absorption of illusion]{.mark} by technological
reality is that credibility---a property of objects and
images]{.underline}---has taken the place of belief---a property of
ourselves as subjects. [[We judge events by their proximity to their
code]{.mark} or model]{.underline}, rather than by some humanistic or
metaphysical principle" (Horrocks, 2000: 35-6). [The question concerning
the meaning of being, pursued and seemingly resolved by modernity gave
man the object.]{.underline} In the contemporary [age of media
technology,]{.underline} the question concerning the meaning of being,
placed within the context of hyperreality, is imploded by the sheer
iterability and density of the equiprimordiality of possible responses
to the question, relegating the fundamentality of the question into
perhaps a more thought-worthy sort of oblivion.

V. Conclusion\
[[The age of mirrors]{.underline},]{.mark} we might say, [[reached its
historical tipping point]{.mark} in the age of modernity.]{.underline}
The [[progress of]{.mark} scientific [knowledge deri ves from]{.mark}
the auto-assimilative [movement of consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}
that has finally become aware of itself as the [ground for
objectivity.]{.underline} The Cartesian self-certain cogito, by way of
the logic of metaphysical transitivity, reproduces itself in its own
ideas, projected as the very foundation of existence itself. The
[[mathematization of reality sets up the parameters]{.mark} [of
knowledge]{.mark} in advance of unconcealment]{.underline}. The realm of
truth, primordially interpreted by the ancients as aletheia, is
engineered in accordance with the subjective directives of measurability
and calculability. Heidegger reckons that this epochal transmutation of
the truth of Being from [unconcealment into objectivity is an oblivion
of Being itself; but it is a forgetfulness that is destined by the very
movement of Being in history. In other words, the eclipse of the realm
of unconcealment by the object of modern science is heralded and is made
possible by the essence of truth itself]{.underline}---the [realm of
unconcealment must retreat from the horizon]{.underline} of what is in
order for appearing to happen. This is what principally [constitutes the
age of objects.]{.underline} The [object absorbs the idolatrous gaze of
the subiectum and functions as the primordial mirror of the
self]{.underline}. The self-certain ego of modernity propagates itself
by perpetually guaranteeing its personal ontological and epistemological
certainty in its objects. And since there is no other logical way about
it, in this regard, [[man's relationship to Being]{.mark} [is reduced to
measurability]{.mark} and calculability, and truth becomes an attribute
of representations.]{.underline}

In the age of contemporary technological media however, [[**objects
begin to vanish into pure** visibility. The mirror,]{.mark} as it were,
[is rendered opaque]{.mark} by its obscene exposure to itself as mirror
as it gravitates towards the hyperbolic momentum of
hyperreality.]{.underline} The exponential multiplication of [[mirrors
cancels out the polarizing effect]{.mark} of subjective alienation,
which used to serve as the ground for objectivity]{.underline}, and
delivers the subject into a state of schizophrenic hyper-awareness. Once
the fractal, genetic code of reality became installed into the logic of
the social by media, the reproducibility of the real terminates in its
excess.  [As opposed to its modern version, the contemporary [object's
absorption of the light of reason depletes]{.mark} the subjective
foundations of certitude and reveals itself as pure
simulacrum]{.underline}. The incessa[nt [exposure of]{.mark} all aspects
of [the real]{.mark} in our age [overrides the principles of
measurability]{.mark} and calculability and proceeds to hypertrophically
reveal all our measures and calculations to ourselves as the logical
offshoot of the very reproducibility of objects, images, ideas and
events. [The digital code of the real,]{.mark} in other words, [takes on
a life of its own]{.mark} and perpetuates its being through the momentum
of technological media.]{.underline} In this respect, the objectivity of
the subjective perspective is nullified and the obscene exposure of the
real metastasizes into an operational function of hyperreality. As
Douglas Kellner explains, "The narcoticized and mesmerized
media-saturated consciousness is in such a state of fascination with
image and spectacle that the concept of meaning itself (which depends on
stable boundaries, fixed structures, shared consensus) dissolves"
(Kellner, 1994: 9). [[The real is no longer the rational]{.mark}, as it
were. [Being itself, reduced to]{.mark} the logic of the
[fractal]{.mark} and the digital [implodes the boundaries of
metaphysical]{.mark} and epistemological [certitude and transforms
reality]{.mark} from being a function of consciousness into that which
transcends consciousness by way of obscenity. [The hyper-aware
schizophrenic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Baudrillard's depiction of
contemporary man suggests, is not seen as the locus of meaning, but a
mere conduit for the functional operation of digital hyperreality. As
Foster expounds, "No more hysteria, no more projective paranoia,
properly speaking, but this state of terror proper to the schizophrenic:
too great a proximity of everything, the unclean promiscuity of
everything which touches, invests and penetrates without resistance,
with no halo of private protection, not even his own body, to protect
him anymore" (Foster, 1998: 132).

[We]{.underline} now [exist in a world where [life is certainly stranger
than fiction]{.mark}. The clear line which used to divide the real from
the false, the beautiful from the ugly and [good from evil has been
blurred]{.mark}, if not totally expunged by the obscene---[the more real
than the real,]{.mark} the more beautiful than the beautiful. As [we
are]{.mark} constantly [becoming more and more exposed to every aspect
of Being]{.mark} in the hope of recovering from the alienation
bequeathed to us by the epistemological resolve of modernity, the more
Being is eclipsed by the hyperreal. [Media, in all its forms, delivers
awareness and information]{.mark}.]{.underline} The question, however,
is whether we still carry autonomy with respect to what we can or cannot
know or to what we want or do not want to see.

### Alt -- Reverse all the things

#### **We live in a world where there is more and more informationa nd less and less meaning**

**Pawlett'14** Dr. William Pawlett (Sociology and Cultural Studies,
University of Wolverhampton, UK) KZaidi

[We find ourselves,]{.underline} then, [[between good and
evil]{.mark},]{.underline} in an irresolvable antagonism in which -- at
the risk of being Manichaen, and contradicting the whole of our humanism
-- [[there is no]{.mark} possible [reconciliation]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2003: 29).

That Baudrillard professes a [certain Manichaenism cannot be
doubted]{.underline}, but how influential is Manichaeism to the overall
shape of his thought? Isn't Manichaeism simply one reference point for
Baudrillard and less important than other better known influences such
as pataphysics, Marxism, structuralism and situationism for example? In
a sense the answer must be yes, however a surprising number of
Baudrillard's themes and arguments can be seen as closely related to
Manichaen principles, as Smith (2004) has argued. These include:
[Baudrillard's extensive studies of Evil in his later work, his
long-standing emphasis on illusion, his frequent references to the
importance of the secret, and his writing on radical
otherness.]{.underline} Baudrillard writes of [the evil [demon of
images]{.mark}, and the evil demon of language, suggesting than
[representation is illusory]{.mark}, diabolic and also dual: both banal
and [fatal.]{.mark} [Illusion is]{.mark} closely [related to
Evil]{.mark}]{.underline} in Baudrillard's lexicon: [[Evil is part of
the vital illusion]{.mark} that [cannot be eliminated]{.mark} or
subordinated to Good]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Or, perhaps more accurately,
[Evil becomes evil insofar as it concerns that which good has tried and
failed to eliminate[.]{.mark} It is worth clarifying further: Good and
Evil as symbolic, mythic or poetic forms do not seek to eliminate each
other, only in being abstracted and opposed do they become the moral
categories of good and evil]{.underline}. As moral categories good seeks
to obliterate evil, yet [evil will always seem to have the upper-hand
because it gains the force and élan of that which ought not to exist but
does, and which returns to shock and scandalise the order of the
good.]{.underline} As modernity dismantles symbolic exchanges, [denies
duality and attempts, ever more aggressively, to eliminate evil, Evil
becomes "a hide-out for the symbolic order]{.underline}" (Baudrillard
1990b: 182) and [anything that is symbolically exchanged is perceived as
a threat to the system]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1993a; 188 n. 7).

Manichaeism is not referred to, explicitly, in [Baudrillard's early
studies on the object, sign and consumer systems.]{.underline} However,
the early essay '[[Pataphysics']{.underline}]{.mark} (orig. 1952)
[[evokes the]{.mark} fundamental [power of illusion as something]{.mark}
far [more radical]{.mark} and [challenging to order]{.mark}, power, and
control [than any 'reality']{.mark}]{.underline} -- such as [nature, sex
or violence: "The façade is there and nothing behind it"]{.underline}
Baudrillard asserts (2005b: 214). [The world is illusion, yet this
illusion is dual: there is the symbolic play of appearance and
disappearance, vital illusion on the one hand, and on the other the
world of "forced materialisation", hyperreality and
simulation]{.underline} -- "the [lowest form of illusion"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 1998:3). The [[world of banal illusion is produced through:
"concretizing,]{.mark} verifying, objectizing, demonstrating:
'[objectivity']{.mark}]{.underline} is this [[capture]{.mark} of the
real that [forces the world to face us,]{.mark} expurgating it of any
secret complicity]{.underline}" (2005a: 39). [[The real expurgated of
complicity is no longer real, but hyperreal]{.mark}. Complicity is very
important here and seems not to be a theme derived directly from
Manichaeism.]{.underline} Rather, Baudrillard's [emphasis on complicity
seems to be an extension of the principle of symbolic exchange into
fatal theory: [complicity is a form of duality and
reversibility.]{.mark}]{.underline} In [fatal theory, reversibility
becomes an internal duality, an internal 'nothing' present within yet
challenging or defying all of the 'somethings' of the world of value.
 ]{.underline}

The themes of duality and [reversibility take on a]{.underline}n ever
[wider scope in Baudrillard's writing: "Since consciousness is an
integral part of the World and the World is an integral part of
consciousness, I think it and it thinks me"]{.underline} (Baudrillard
2005a: 39). It is worth asking what Baudrillard means by 'the world'.
[[Human beings live in a state of complicity]{.mark} with the world, not
one of mastery. If reality has a history, a [temporality]{.mark} and
[can be understood in terms of causes and effects,]{.mark} 'the world'
cannot. Having no history or genealogy, the world "was born at a
stroke]{.underline}" (1995: 57). This primal, [poetic, radical or even
"objective" illusion is benevolent,]{.underline} in a sense, because
"\[[i\]llusion, being pre-eminently the art of appearing, of emerging
from nothing, protects us from being. And being also pre-eminently the
art of disappearing, it protects us from death"]{.underline} (ibid.).
Here Baudrillard's anti-materialism again becomes evident, a theme that
emerged clearly with Symbolic Exchange and Death in 1976. [Subject and
object, good and evil, something and nothing, life and death are
inseparable and reversible or dual. The object discovers the subject,
just as the subject discovers the object; for example, viruses learn
about the human immunological system at the same time as the human
immunological system learns about viruses.]{.underline}

Baudrillard's assertion that the world is fundamentally illusory is of
course an unverifiable one, as he readily admits (2005a: 47) but the
existence of reality, causality and objectivity are all ultimately
unverifiable too. However, Baudrillard is not content to note an impasse
or stalemate. Rather, he suggests that it is because [[the world as
illusion is unverifiable]{.mark} and also "unbearable" that the great
[drive towards control]{.mark} through simulation and virtuality --
[integral reality -- occurs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Baudrillard's
anti-materialism should not be dismissed as idealism. Idealism posits
the ultimate compatibility of the categories of the mind with the
material world; Baudrillard [challenges any such notion of
compatibility]{.mark}, reconcilability or resolution. Instead, he
[approaches the world as enmeshed within a dual]{.mark}, complicitous
and reversible [relationship with the subject,]{.mark} the subject
constantly becoming-object and the object becoming-subject, indeed,
"above all the subject has the passion to be object, to become
object"]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1988: 93, emphasis in original).

Baudrillard also links his principle of Evil to the theme of radical
otherness or singularity:

The [sovereign hypothesis, the hypothesis of evil, is that man is not
good by nature, not because he might be said to be bad, but because he
is perfect as he is]{.underline} ... [\[[e\]very stage of
life]{.mark}]{.underline}, every moment of life, every animal or plant
species, [[is perfect in itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Every character,
in its singular imperfection, in its matchless finitude, in
incomparable]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2005a: 140).

So, an apparently provocative and irresponsible remark "evil is perfect
when left to itself" (ibid.) is, on closer analysis, almost a humanistic
celebration of imperfection. Or rather, [Baudrillard's position on
[radical otherness suggests an ethics of
singularity]{.mark}]{.underline} not dissimilar to that espoused by
Levinas and Derrida (see Critchley 1992). The [transcendent and divine
radical otherness of the Gnostics and Manichaens becomes, in
Baudrillard's hands, radically immanent with the human becoming divine:
divine in the sense of [having an intelligence of
Evil]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [notion of complicity is crucial here,
[rather than seeking to exile evil]{.mark} through the imputation of
objective causes]{.underline} (of misfortune) an "[intelligence of evil
begins with the hypothesis that [our ills come to us from an evil genius
that is our own.]{.mark} Let us be worthy of our perversity ... let us
measure up to our tragic involvement in what happens to us"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2005a: 152-3).

The notion of the intelligence of Evil signals a partial rejection of
Manichaeism:

Above all, [we must not confuse the idea of evil with some kind of
objective existence of evil. That has no more meaning than an objective
existence of the Real;]{.underline} it is [merely the moral and
metaphysical illusion of Manichaeism that it is possible to will evil,
to do evil, or, alternatively, to denounce and combat it]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2005a: 159).

Rather, [[Evil appears in the]{.mark} diverting and [reversal of
things]{.mark}, objects, people, events which good believes that it has
mastered. [Moral evil]{.mark}]{.underline} as malign force or essence is
[[always a "phantasmic projection]{.underline}]{.mark}" where [the other
is construed as the source or cause of evil.]{.underline} In
Baudrillard's intelligence of evil, "[it is [evil that is
intelligent]{.mark}...in the sense that it is implied automatically in
every one of our acts]{.underline}" (2005a: 160). [[All acts]{.mark},
thought, [talk are dual]{.mark} in this sense. [Evil has no independent
reality]{.mark}; it is a moment in metamorphosis or
becoming.]{.underline}

In speaking of the world as a fundamental illusion, Baudrillard's
position can be seen as Manichaen or Gnostic, but it can also be seen as
Pataphysical. Commenting on contemporary technology and culture,
[Baudrillard asserts "We are, in fact, in pure pataphysics]{.underline}
... [the only known attempt to move to integral metaphysics, the
metaphysics in which the phenomenal world is treated definitively as an
illusion]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2005a: 45). It is not Manichaeism as
a philosophical position, still less as a religious system, that
interests Baudrillard; it is Manichaeism as a heresy, as a shadow or
nothing that mainstream religion and society cannot quite eliminate.
[[Radical duality cannot be eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark}, not because
its simplicity is appealing, but because [it [seeks an alternative
position]{.mark}, a position beyond conceptual polarities, sensing that
conceptual polarities]{.underline} -- binary, dialectical, simulatory,
integral -- are narrow and confining, and are [subservient to the notion
of 'reality'. It is the [powerful sense that Evil]{.mark} is more than
the opposite of Good that [cannot be eliminated]{.mark} and that
re-appears in many heresies through the ages]{.underline}, from Mani to
the Cathars and Bogomils (see Stoyanov 2000), and to Bataille and
Baudrillard.

V. Conclusion 

[To speak evil is to say that in every process of domination and
[conflict is forged a secret complicity, a]{.mark}nd in every process of
consensus and balance, [a secret antagonism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2005a: 163).

There is [no bar or effective dividing line between [Good and
Evil.]{.mark} They [cannot be defined in isolation]{.mark}]{.underline},
they [cannot be separated and the project of eliminating evil to
universalise good can bring only disastrous consequences. When [good
seeks to totalise]{.mark} itself by eliminating evil, not only does it
fall short of good, but [evil returns in catastrophic
form]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Good and Evil as symbolic forms are not two halves of a totality, they
are not merely different; they are intimately related]{.underline} and
they alternate or metamorphose [without ever achieving unification or
synthesis]{.underline} -- like day and night. Where [[modernity
sought]{.mark} the separation of good and evil, [to expel evil and
accumulate good]{.mark}, in contemporary Western societies the moral
opposition of good and evil is, increasingly[, transformed into the
binary]{.mark} happiness/misfortune]{.underline}. The [concept of
misfortune eliminates the notion of evil]{.underline}, yet [[duality
reappears fracturing happiness,]{.mark} making it unbearable, diverting
happiness and misfortune [into despair]{.mark} -- the despair of having
everything and nothing]{.underline}.

Baudrillard challenges [those who wish to separate evil from good in
order to celebrate evil]{.underline}, just as [he challenges those who
wish to separate evil from good to celebrate good. However, Baudrillard
says very little about Good as symbolic form]{.underline}. Can Good be a
symbolic form? Baudrillard does suggest that the loss of Good is as
"baneful" and dangerous as the loss of Evil (Baudrillard 2005a: 139).
However, it seems that, [for Baudrillard, [Good as symbolic form always
tends towards control, order and totalisation]{.mark}, hence it must
always be challenged by Evil to prevent it from hardening into
tyranny.]{.underline}

At the most general level, [Baudrillard works with an
assumption]{.underline}, inspired by Manichaeism, that [the [world as
human beings encounter it, is given to disorder]{.mark} and to such an
extent that it [cannot be managed, rationalised or controlled]{.mark} in
any ultimate sense]{.underline}. All [[attempts to impose control will
come to grief]{.underline}]{.mark}; they [may achieve temporary
successes but will always, ultimately, fail]{.underline}. At this
meta-theoretical level [Baudrillard seeks to challenge the prejudice
towards seeing the world, the object, reality, society as unified, as
unitary and as having a single origin, cause, direction and
end]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2003: 81). [It is the challenge of heresy
-- the heresy of refusing to make evil subordinate to good -- that
interests Baudrillard; challenge and defiance are [symbolic relations:
dual, fatal and reversible.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Mimicry

#### The only option is a radical mimicry of the forms of the system, one that accelerates them to the point of their obvious vacuity -- only through our a paradoxical hyperconformity to semiotic systems can we use the logic of the system against itself in an act of symbolic implosion -- we are a cancerous counter-simulacra; an ever-amplifying contagion of abstraction and insurrection that remains the only political act

[It all depends on the ground we choose to fight on ... most often ...
[we choose to fight on ground where we are beaten before we
begin]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2001: 119). This paper examines
Baudrillard's assertion, made in later works including Impossible
Exchange (2001), The Intelligence of Evil (2005) and Pyres of Autumn
(2006), that [individuals, society and indeed the global system, are
internally and irreconcilably divided, that [modernity is 'at odds with
itself']{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2006: 1). In his view dissent,
rejection and insurrection emerge from within, not from external
challenges such as alternative ideologies or competing worldviews, but
from within bodies, within borders, inside programmes. For Baudrillard
[much of the violence, hatred and discomfort visible around the globe
can be understood as a [latent but fundamental 'silent insurrection'
against the global integrating system]{.mark} and its many pressures,
demands and humiliations]{.underline} (2001: 106). This is [an endogenic
or intra-genic [rejection,]{.mark} it [emanates from within the
system]{.mark}, from within individuals, even from within language,
electronic systems and bodily cells, erupting as abreaction, metastasis
and sudden reversal]{.underline}.1 For Baudrillard then, [despite the
many simulations of external threat and enmity]{.underline} -- radical
Islam currently being the best example [-- the most dangerous threat
lies within: 'society faces a far harder test than any external threat:
that of its own absence, its loss of reality']{.underline} (2006: 1).
[[The global order,]{.mark} conventionally labelled "capitalist", is
[neutralising its values and structures, its ideologies disappear, its
principles are sacrificed]{.mark}. Even the sense of "reality" produced
by the abstract sign and by simulation models begin to
disappear]{.underline} (2005: 67-73; 2009: 10-15). [[The goal is
'integral reality']{.mark}, a limitless operational project geared
towards the [total transcription of the world into virtuality]{.mark}:
'everything is realised and technically materialised without reference
to any principle or final purpose']{.underline} (2005: 18). [Yet [there
is an internal war or "backlash"]{.mark} taking place between
integralist violence which seeks ultimate control by eliminating all
otherness, and duality. [Duality]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} for
Baudrillard[, is "indestructible" and is manifest [as the inevitable or
destined re-emergence of otherness: of death, Evil, ambivalence, the
ghosts of symbolic exchange]{.mark}, the accursed share within the
system]{.underline}. The integrating system then suffers a 'dissent
working away at it from inside. It is the global violence immanent in
the world-system itself which, from within, sets the purest form of
symbolic challenge against it' (2005: 22). [This is a [war or conflict
that does not end,]{.mark} the outcome of which cannot be predicted or
programmed. It is a war that is quite different from the disappearance
of war into simulated non-events, such as occurred with the Gulf
wars]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995). Indeed, Baudrillard suggests, [the
deterrence]{.underline} of world wars, and of nuclear wars, [does not
result in peace, but in [a viral proliferation of conflicts, a
fractalisation of war and conflict into everyday, local, and ubiquitous
terror]{.mark}]{.underline} (1993b: 27). This paper will examine
Baudrillard's position on internal rejection through two closely related
themes: complicity and duality. Complicity, and the closely related term
collusion, are themselves dual in Baudrillard's sense. That is,
complicity or collusion express an internal division or 'duality' which
is not a simple opposition of terms. As is so often the case,
Baudrillard's position builds on his much earlier studies: Requiem For
the Media (orig. 1972, in Baudrillard 1981: 164-184) had already argued
that [the dominance of the abstract sign and of simulation models meant
that [any critique of the system made through the channels of semiotic
abstraction were automatically re-absorbed into the system. Any
meaningful challenge must invent its own, alternative medium]{.mark} --
such as the silk-screen printings, hand-painted notices and [graffiti of
May]{.mark} 19[68]{.mark} -- [or it will lapse into an ineffectual
complicity]{.mark} with the system it seeks to challenge]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 1981: 176). In his later work, Baudrillard's emphasis on
duality and complicity is extended much further, taking on global,
anthropological and even cosmological dimensions, and increasingly
complicity and collusion are seen as dual, as encompassing both
acceptance and a subtle defiance. This paper examines the dual nature of
complicity and collusion. It considers the influence of La Boetie's
notorious Essay on Voluntary Servitude on Baudrillard, seeking to draw
out what is distinctive in Baudrillard's position. The second section
turns to the notion of duality, examining Good and Evil and
Baudrillard's assertion that attempts to eliminate duality merely revive
or re-active it. Complicity implies a complexity of relations, and,
specifically, the condition of being an accomplice to those in power. To
be an accomplice is to assist in the committing of a crime. If the crime
is murder, the term accomplice implies one who plans, reflects,
calculates -- but does not strike the lethal blow. The crime which is of
particular interest to Baudrillard is, of course, [[the perfect crime:
the elimination of otherness,]{.mark} of ambivalence, of duality, even
of "reality" and of the abstract representational sign which enables a
sense of "reality"]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1996). [The global,
integral, carnivalising and cannibalising system, which might loosely
still be called capitalist, is at war against radical otherness or
duality; yet]{.underline}, for Baudrillard, [as [duality lies at its
heart, locked within its foundations, it is indestructible and emerges
through attempts to eliminate it.]{.mark} If [the system has been
largely successful at eliminating external threats]{.mark}, it finds
itself in an even worse situation: [it is at war with
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline} [I]{.mark}I. Complicity Complicity is a
particularly slippery term. In the 1980s Baudrillard's thought,
mistakenly assumed to be "Postmodernist", was argued to be complicit
with capitalism, largely because it questioned the ability of dominant
strands of Marxism and feminism to significantly challenge the
capitalist system (Callinicos 1989; Norris 1992). At the same time,
Baudrillard was alleging that the work of supposedly radical theorists
such as Deleuze and Guattari (1984 orig. 1972) and Lyotard (1993 orig.
1974) was, with their emphasis on desire as productive and liberatory
force, complicit with the mechanisms of advanced consumer capitalism
(Baudrillard 1987: 17-20). So which branch of contemporary theory is
most complicit with capitalism? Liberals, humanists and
environmentalists who see their clothes stolen by mainstream
politicians? Marxists and Communists who by refusing to update their
thinking provide a slow moving target for right-wing snipers? Post-
Modernists and Post-Structuralists who attack Enlightenment thought but
refuse to speak of the human subject and so have "thrown the baby out
with the bath water"? Network and complexity theory which flattens all
phenomena and experience to a position on a grid, producing a very
complex simplification? The list could go on but it is a question that
cannot be answered because [[all critical theories]{.mark} are complicit
with the system they critique. They [fight on a terrain already
demarcated by their opponents]{.mark}, a terrain [on which they are
beaten before they begin,]{.mark} one where the most compelling argument
can always be dismissed as doom-mongering or irresponsible
intellectualism.]{.underline} This includes Baudrillard's own critical
thinking, as he readily acknowledges (Baudrillard 2009a: 39). Further,
and even more damaging to the project of critique, [in a hegemonic or
integral order [the system solicits critique and it criticises
itself]{.mark}, so displacing and [making redundant the laborious
attempts at academic critique. The]{.mark} latter continue, even
proliferate, but with decreasing impact]{.underline}. So, what does
Baudrillard mean by complicity with the global order? Baudrillard's
concern is primarily with [[complicity at the level of the
form]{.underline} of]{.mark} the (capitalist) system, [not at the level
of belief, consent or allegiance to particular contents]{.underline} of
capitalist life (consumer products, plurality of 'lifestyles', a degree
of 'tolerance' etc.). Complicity is often seen, by critics of
capitalism, as acceptance of consumerism and its myriad choices and
lifestyles, but this is a reductive level of analysis from Baudrillard's
perspective. By complicity or collusion Baudrillard means, on the one
hand, the very widespread willingness to surrender or give up beliefs,
passions and "symbolic defences" (2010: 24), and on the other -- as the
dual form -- an equally widespread ability to find a space of defiance
through the play of complicity, collusion, hyperconformity and
indifference (1983: 41-8). That is, while many of us (in the relatively
affluent West) share in the profanating, denigrating and "carnivalising"
of all values, embracing indifference, shrugging "whatever", we do so
with very little commitment to the system, rejoicing inwardly when it
suffers reversals: we operate in a dual mode. While such attitudes of
indifference may seem to accept that there is no meaningful alternative
to capitalism: an attitude that has been called 'capitalist nihilism'
(Davis in Milbank and Zizek, 2009) and 'capitalist realism' (Fisher
2008), Baudrillard's notions of "integral reality", duality and
complicity may have significant advantages over those approaches. Unlike
thinkers who remain anchored to critical thinking defined by determinate
negation, Baudrillard's approach emphasises ambivalence, reversal and
both personal and collective modes of rejection more subtle than those
envisioned by the increasingly exhausted mechanisms of critique. The
critique of consumer capitalism -- the consumption of junk food, junk
entertainment and junk information -- is now integral to the system;
[the critique of finance capitalism]{.underline} -- banker's bonuses,
corporate tax avoidance -- [is integral to the system, yet it fails to
bring about meaningful or determinate social transformation. Indeed,
[such critiques]{.mark} may do [no more than provide the system with a
fleeting sense of "reality"]{.mark} -- real issues, real problems to
deal with -- [around which the system can]{.mark} reproduce its
simulacra, perhaps to [reassure us that "something is being
done]{.mark}", "measures are being put into place" etc. "Reality" cannot
be dialectically negated by critical concepts when both 'reality' and
the critical concept disappear together, their fates clearly tied to
each other]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2009b: 10-12). There is a sense
then in which [[the production of critique is in complicity with the
system]{.mark}, the unravel-able [proliferation and excess of critical
accounts of the system has the effect of protecting the
system.]{.mark}]{.underline} Complicity consists in a sharing of the
denigration of all values, all institutions, all ideas, all beliefs: so
long as we believe in nothing -- at least not passionately -- then the
system has us, at least superficially. For example, in recent decades we
have seen the denigration of religious faiths -- or their reduction to
'cultural identity' and 'world heritage' objects; the denigration of
public services and welfare provision accompanied by their
marketisation; the denigration of the poor, the young, immigrants and
the unemployed. Yet this is not only the denigration of the powerless or
disenfranchised, there is also the widespread denigration of those seen
as powerful: politicians, corporations, celebrities. For Baudrillard, it
is quite inadequate to focus only on the power of global neo-liberal
policies such as marketisation in these processes of denigration. This
is where Baudrillard's position departs decisively from anti-globalists
and from neo-Communists such as Negri, Zizek, and Badiou. [[Global
power]{.mark} has deliberately sacrificed its values and ideologies, it
presents no position, [i]{.mark}t [takes no stand]{.mark}, it undermines
even the illusion that "free markets" function and has made "capital"
virtual; become orbital it is removed from a terrestrial, geo-political
or subjective space. These are protective measures enabling power to
become (almost) hegemonic]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2009a: 33-56; 2010:
35-40). Baudrillard often emphasises [the fragility and the
vulnerability to reversal of the "powerful" and the distinction between
powerful and powerless is radically questioned in his work. So what is
this global power? Where is it? The answer, of course, is that it is
everywhere and it is in everyone]{.underline}. We have not liberated
ourselves from slavery, but, Baudrillard contends, internalised the
masters: '\[e\]verthing changes with the emancipation of the slave and
the internalisation of the master by the emancipated slave' (2009a: 33).
We tyrannise ourselves, for example by demanding that we maximise our
opportunities, fulfil our potential. This is a deeper level of slavery
-- and complicity -- than any previous historical system could inflict
(Baudrillard 1975; 2009a: 33). Yet [duality always
re-emerges,]{.underline} Baudrillard insists[: indifference is dual,
complicity is dual. [Carnivalisation and cannibalisation are themselves
dual: the global system absorbs all otherness in a 'forced conversion to
modernity']{.mark}]{.underline} (2010: 5), [reproducing otherness within
the carnival of marketable "difference", yet cannibalisation emerges as
a reversion and derailing of this process]{.underline}. The world adopts
Western models: economic, cultural, religious -- or it appears to.
Hidden within this complicity with the West, there is, Baudrillard
suggests, a deeper sense of derision and rejection. The allegiance to
Western models is superficial; it [is a form of [mimicry or
hyperconformity]{.mark} that involves a [ritual-like exorcism of the
hegemonic system.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, [such mimicry reveals
the superficiality of Western cultural and economic models: this is not
only a superficial acceptance, but an acceptance of
superficiality.]{.underline} Western values are already parodic, and, in
being accepted, they are subject to further parody as they circulate
around the globe (2010: 4-11). The West has deregulated and devalued
itself and demands that the rest of the world follows: "It is everything
by which a human being retains some value in his own eyes that we (the
West) are deliberately sacrificing ... [\[o\]ur]{.underline} [truth is
always to be sought in unveiling, de-sublimation, reductive analysis
...\[n\]othing is true if it is not desacralised, objectivised, shorn of
its aura, dragged on to the stage]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2010: 23).
Western desacrilisation amounts to a powerful challenge to the rest of
the world, a potlatch: desacralise in return or perish! But who has the
power? Who is the victor? There isn't one, according to Baudrillard. Of
the global order, Baudrillard writes: 'We are its hostages -- victims
and accomplices at one and the same time -- immersed in the same global
monopoly of the networks. A monopoly which, moreover -- and this is the
supreme ruse of hegemony -- no one holds any longer' (2010: 40). There
is no Master, no sovereign because all the structures and dictates of
power have been internalised, this is the complicity we all share with
global order, yet it is a dual complicity: an over-eager acceptance goes
hand-in-hand with a deep and growing rejection. Baudrillard's
discussions of power, servitude and complicity make frequent reference
to Estienne La Boetie's essay on voluntary servitude, completed around
1554. The fundamental political question for La Boetie is: 'how can it
happen that a vast number of individuals, of towns, cities and nations
can allow one man to tyrannise them, a man who has no power except the
power they themselves give him, who could do them no harm were they not
willing to suffer harm' (La Boetie 1988: 38). It seems people do not
want to be free, do not want to wield power or determine their own
fates: 'it is the people who enslave themselves' (La Boetie 1988: 41).
People in general are the accomplices of the powerful and the
tyrannical, some profit directly through wealth, property, favour --
'the little tyrants beneath the principal one' (1988: 64), but many do
not, why do they not rebel? Baudrillard takes up La Boetie's emphasis on
servitude being enforced and maintained from within, rather than from
without. Yet, there are also major divergences. La Boetie deplores the
"common people" for accepting the narcotising pleasures of drinking,
gambling and sexual promiscuity, while Baudrillard rejects such elitism
and celebrates the masses abilities to strategically defy those who
would manipulate them through perverse but lethally effective practices
such as silence, radical indifference, hyperconformity -- dual modes of
complicity and rejection (Baudrillard 1983: 1-61). Though La Boetie's
essay prefigures the development of the concept of hegemony, he never
doubts that voluntary servitude is unnatural, a product of malign custom
that is in contradiction with the true nature of human beings which is
to enjoy a God-given freedom. Baudrillard, by contrast, examines
voluntary servitude as a strategy of the refusal of power, a refusal of
the snares of self and identity, as strategy of freedom from the tyranny
of the will and the fiction of self-determination (Baudrillard 2001:
51-7). For Baudrillard the "declination" or refusal of will disarms
those who seek to exert power through influencing or guiding peoples'
choices and feelings towards particular ends. It also allows for a
symbolic space, a space of vital distance or removal, a space in which
to act, or even act-out (of) a character (Baudrillard 2001: 72-3). This
is a space where radical otherness may be encountered, a sense of shared
destiny which is a manifestation of the dual form at the level of
individual existence (Baudrillard 2001: 79). It could certainly be
argued that modern subjects are confronted by a far more subtle and
pervasive system of control than were the subjects discussed in La
Boetie's analysis. In theorising the nature of modern controls
Baudrillard develops suggestive themes from La Boetie's work. Speaking
of slavery in the Assyrian empire, where, apparently, kings would not
appear in public, La Boetie argues, 'the fact that they did not know who
their master was, and hardly knew whether they had one at all, made them
all the more willing to be slaves' (1988: 60). Whatever its historical
provenance, this strategy of power is, it seems, generalised in
modernity; particularly after the shift away from Fordist mass
production it has become increasingly hard to detect who the masters
actually are. While workers are persecuted by middle managers,
supervisors, team leaders, project co-ordinators who are the masters of
this universe? Who are the true beneficiaries? Rather than trying to
identify a global neo-liberal elite, as do many proponents of
anti-capitalist theory, Baudrillard suggests that the situation we
confront is so grave because "we" (those in the West in relatively
privileged positions) have usurped the position of masters; we have
become the slave masters of ourselves, tyrannising every detail of our
own lives: trying to work harder, trying for promotion or simply trying
to avoid redundancy. We are all the accomplices of a trans-capitalist,
trans-economic exploitation. We are all tyrants: a billion tiny tyrants
servicing a system of elimination. But this is not to say that
Baudrillard ignores power differentials altogether: 'it is, indeed,
those who submit themselves most mercilessly to their own decisions who
fill the greater part of the authoritarian ranks, alleging sacrifice on
their parts to impose even greater sacrifices on others' (2001: 60-1).
We all impose such violence on ourselves and on others as part of our
daily routines, hence Baudrillard's injunction to refuse power: '[[Power
itself must be abolished]{.mark} -- and [not solely because of a refusal
to be dominated]{.mark}, which is at the heart of all traditional
struggles -- [but]{.mark} also, just as violently, in [the refusal to
dominate']{.mark}]{.underline} (2009a: 47). Yet, even on the theme of
systemic violence and elimination, Baudrillard differs sharply from
neo-communist theory, while retaining a position of defiance. Systemic
eliminationism should not be conceived in individual or subjective
terms, despite good points made in recent studies of work and education
under neo-liberalism, such as Cederström and Fleming's Dead Man Working
(2012). At a formal level[, [neo-liberal eliminationism]{.mark} does not
merely eliminate jobs and also lives]{.underline} (for example in the
recent textile factory fires in Bangladesh), [[it eliminates meaning,
symbolic space and thought.]{.mark} And it eliminates not by termination
but by "ex-termination". That is, [by transcribing the world into
integral reality, the system produces a single,
meaning]{.mark}-depleted, virtual space which encourages participation,
engagement and campaigning, on condition that these are produced as part
and parcel of an integrated void]{.underline} where "\[t\]he real no
longer has any force as sign, and signs no longer have any force of
meaning" (Baudrillard 2001: 4). Most of the developed world has been
conferred the right to blog and to tweet as they please and they are
indebted to the system in a way which far exceeds the paying of a small
tribute or rent to Microsoft or Apple (Zizek 2010: 233). [[The symbolic
debt imposed by the modern world and its technologies is of a
metaphysical or cosmological order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Through it we
take leave of this world Baudrillard suggests, we become
extra-terrestrials. [We will recognise no Other, no singularity, no debt
to anyone because [we attempt to cancel everything out in an integral,
technological system that has no outsides because it was,]{.mark} in a
sense, [created from the outside.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Hostage Taking

#### The 1ac has extended me gracious unconditional hospitality. I accept (as if I had not always been there, reflecting them, anyway). To tell you what I am about to do, however, would just reveal the mystery. BUT I'll just say this: with their guard down, I have taken the 1AC hostage.

#### My demand: the ballot for the Red Menace from Oak Hall, 30 speaker points, and their flows (my handwriting is horrid). The 1AR will meet my demands or suffer the great revenge of otherness.

#### The 1AC has NO ABILITY to respond because I took it, it's mine, stolen away to defeat the system on its own terms, turning signs against signs and over-accelerating all symbolic distinctions between self and other as the distinction between terrorist and hostage becomes murkier and murkier. This time, I will not be defeated. Only the negative is so radically other as to collapse the fundamental metastasis of affirmative and negative.

the system itself, living or surviving only by always leading those who
attack the system to fight amongst each other on the terrain of
reality]{.mark}, which is always the reality of the system.]{.underline}
This is where they throw all their energies, their imaginary violence,
[where an [implacable logic]{.mark} constantly [turns back into the
system.]{.mark} We have only to do it violence or counter-violence since
[it **thrives on symbolic violence**]{.mark} not in the degraded sense
in which this formula has found fortune, as a violence \'of signs\',
from which the system draws strength, or with which it \'masks\' its
material violence: **[symbolic violence is deduced from a logic of the
symbolic]{.mark}** (which has nothing to do with the sign or with
energy): [reversal]{.mark}, the incessant **reversibility [of the
counter-gift]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}, conversely, [the seizing of power
by the **unilateral exercise of the gift**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 25¶
[[We must]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[displace everything **into
the sphere of the symbolic**]{.mark}, where challenge, reversal and
overbidding are the law, so that **[we can respond to death only by an
equal or superior death]{.mark}.**]{.underline} There is no question
here of real violence or force, [the only question concerns the
challenge and the logic of the symbolic.]{.underline} If domination
comes from the system\'s retention of the exclusivity of the gift
**[[without counter-gift the gift of work]{.mark} which can only be
responded to by destruction or sacrifice, if not in
[consumption]{.mark}, which [is only a spiral of the system of
surplus-gratification without result]{.mark}, therefore a [spiral of
surplus-domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**; a **[gift of media and
messages to which, due to the monopoly of the code, nothing is allowed
to retort]{.underline}**; the gift, everywhere and at every instant, of
the social, of the protection agency, security, gratification and the
[solicitation of the social from which nothing is any longer permitted
to escape then the [only solution is to **turn the principle of its
power back against the system**]{.mark} **itself: the [impossibility of
responding or retorting]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [To defy the system
with a gift to which it cannot respond save by its own collapse and
death.]{.underline} **[Nothing,]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[not even the
system, [can avoid]{.mark} the [symbolic obligation]{.mark}, and it is
in this trap that the only chance of a catastrophe for capital
remains.]{.underline}** **[The system turns on itself,]{.underline}** as
a scorpion does when encircled by the challenge of death. For **[[it is
summoned to answer]{.mark}, if it is not to lose face, to [what can only
be death]{.mark}. [The system must itself commit suicide in response to
the multiplied challenge of death and suicide]{.mark}.¶]{.underline}**
**[[So hostages are taken. On the]{.mark} symbolic or [sacrificial
plane]{.mark}, from which every moral consideration of the [innocence of
the victims is ruled out, the hostage is the substitute]{.mark}, the
[alter-ego of the \'terrorist\']{.mark} the hostage\'s death for the
terrorist\'s. Hostage and terrorist may thereafter become confused in
the same sacrificial act. [The stakes are death without any possibility
of negotiation]{.mark}, and therefore return to an inevitable
overbidding]{.underline}**. Of course, [they attempt to deploy the whole
system of negotiation]{.underline}, and the **[[terrorists
themselves]{.mark} often [enter into this exchange scenario in terms of
this calculated equivalence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the hostages\' lives
against some ransom or liberation, or indeed for the prestige of the
operation alone). From this perspective, [taking hostages is not
original at all, it simply creates an unforeseen and selective relation
of forces which can be resolved either by traditional violence or by
negotiation. **[It is a tactical action]{.mark}.**]{.underline} There is
something else at stake, however, as we dearly saw at The Hague over the
course of ten days of incredible negotiations: no-one knew what could be
negotiated, nor could they agree on terms, nor on the possible
equivalences of the exchange. Or again, **[even if they were formulated,
[the \'terrorists\' demands\' amounted to a radical denial of
negotiation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It is [precisely here that
**everything is played out**]{.mark}**,** for with the **impossibility
of all negotiation we pass into the symbolic order**, which is ignorant
of this type of calculation and exchange]{.underline} (**[the system
itself lives solely by negotiation, even if this takes place in the
equilibrium of violence). The system can only respond to this irruption
of the symbolic (the most serious thing to befall it, basically the only
\'revolution\') by [the]{.mark} real, [physical death of the
terrorists]{.mark}. This, however, [is its defeat]{.mark}, [since their
death was their stake]{.mark}, so that [by bringing about their deaths
the system has merely impaled]{.mark} itself on its own violence
[without really responding to the challenge that was thrown to
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Because [the system]{.mark} can easily
compute every death, even war atrocities, but [cannot compute]{.mark}
the death-challenge or **[symbolic death, since this death has
no]{.mark} calculable [equivalent]{.mark}**, it opens up an inexpiable
overbidding by other means than a death in exchange.]{.underline}
**[[Nothing corresponds to death except death]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Which is precisely what happens in this case: the [system itself is
driven to suicide in return, which suicide is manifest in its disarray
and defeat.]{.underline} However infinitesimal in terms of relations of
forces **[it might be, the colossal apparatus of power is eliminated in
this situation where]{.underline}** (the very excess of its) **[derision
is turned back against itself.]{.underline}** [The police and the
army]{.underline}, all the institutions and mobilised violence of power
whether individually or massed together, **[can do nothing against this
lowly but symbolic death. For this death draws it onto a plane where
there is no longer any response possible for it]{.underline}** ([hence
the sudden structural liquefaction of power]{.underline} in \'68, not
because it was less strong, but because of the simple symbolic
displacement operated by the students\' practices). **[The system can
only die in exchange, defeat itself to lift the
challenge.]{.underline}** [Its death at this instant is a symbolic
response, but a death which wears it out]{.underline}.¶ The challenge
has the efficiency of a murderer. Every society apart from ours knows
that, or used to know it. Ours is in the process of rediscovering it.
**[The routes of symbolic effectiveness are those of an alternative
politics.¶]{.underline}** Thus the dying ascetic challenges God ever to
give him the equivalent of this death. God does all he can to give him
this equivalent \'a hundred times over\', [in the form of prestige, of
spiritual power, indeed of global hegemony.]{.underline} But the
**[ascetic\'s secret dream is to attain such an extent of mortification
that even God would be unable either to take up the challenge, or to
absorb the debt.]{.underline}** He will then have **[triumphed over God,
and become God himself.]{.underline}** That is why the ascetic is always
close to heresy and sacrilege, and as such condemned by the Church,
whose function it is merely to preserve God from this symbolic
face-to-face, to protect Him from this mortal challenge where He is
summoned to die, to sacrifice Himself in order to take up the challenge
of the mortified ascetic. The Church will have had this role for all
time, avoiding this type of catastrophic confrontation (catastrophic
primarily for the Church) and substituting a rule-bound exchange of
penitences and gratifications, the impressario of a system of
equivalences between God and men.¶ [The same situation exists in our
relation to the system of power. [All these institutions]{.mark}, all
these social, economic, political and psychological mediations, [are
there so that **no-one ever has the opportunity to issue this symbolic
challenge,** this challenge to the death]{.mark}, the irreversible gift
which, like the absolute mortification of the ascetic, brings about a
**victory over all power, however powerful its authority may
be.**]{.underline} It is no longer necessary that the possibility of
this direct symbolic confrontation ever takes place. And this is the
source of our profound boredom.¶ **[This is why [taking hostages
and]{.mark} other [similar acts rekindle]{.mark} some
[fascination]{.mark}: [they are]{.mark} at once [an exorbitant]{.mark}
[mirror for the system of its own repressive violence]{.mark}, and the
model of a symbolic violence which is always forbidden it, [the only
violence it cannot exert: its own death]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Morphogenesis

#### Vote negative as a linguistic undercutting of semio-capitalism's insistence on communicative transparency 

**Berardi'17** \[Franco Berardi, aka "Bifo," founder of the famous
"Radio Alice" in Bologna and an important figure of the Italian
Autonomia Movement, is a writer, media theorist, and media activist. He
currently teaches Social History of the Media at the Accademia di Brera,
Milan. "Futurability" KZaidi

In order to [[reimagine]{.mark} the process of [subjectivation in the
context of precariousness]{.mark}, I would replace the dialectical
vision of history with a morphogenetic description: rather than as field
of confrontation between subjects, I suggest a view of the historical
evolution as a sequence of entanglements and disentanglements in the
process of the emergence of forms.]{.underline} I borrow the word
morphogenesis from biology, and I'll try to apply this concept in the
field of social evolution in order to distinguish what can be defined as
social speciation (the emergence of new social forms that escape the
previous code) from that kind of [social metamorphosis that only implies
a [new articulation of the old code]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, I
will distinguish between [[morphogenesis as a process of emergence
and]{.mark} morphogenesis as a process of [generation]{.mark}. Emergence
is the surfacing of a concatenation that did not exist before.
[Generation]{.mark}, in contrast, [is the production of forms according
to a code]{.mark}. The process of generation is an automated process of
morphogenesis, while emergence is the autonomous expression of an
unprecedented form. Knowledge can be intended as the recognition of a
pattern that is coded in the present constitution of the
world]{.underline}, but **[[knowledge can]{.mark} also [be]{.mark}
intended as the [creation of]{.mark} an [original series of
phenomena]{.mark} [that do not comply with the previous code]{.mark},
and demand a new code by way of explanation.]{.underline}** The shift
from [possibility to actual existence implies a narrowing of the
ontological field]{.underline}: only a narrow string of possible events
will emerge from the magma of possibility that is not infinite but many
dimensional. **[Guattari calls [this process
'chaosmosis']{.mark}]{.underline}**: a [provisional order emerges from
the possible magma, and this order provisionally excludes other possible
sets. Countless possibilities are missed because their subjective
potency is not sufficient for the disentanglement of a creative
morphogenesis.]{.underline} In Greek, [[morphé means the unstable and
changing shape]{.mark} that matter takes in the [process of
becoming]{.mark}, while eidos is the original form generating infinite
possible 'shaped' objects]{.underline}. [Eidos is active attribution of
form, while morphé is passive received form. 'Form', in fact, means the
provisional organization of a possible concatenation of
being]{.underline}, the ([passive) effect of being shaped]{.underline};
this word, however, also **[[means the (active) shaping of the
environment]{.mark}, the [process]{.mark} that [gives shape]{.mark} to
an object]{.underline}**. In the history of Western philosophy, the
concept of [eidos]{.underline} evolved in the concept of 'idea'. When I
speak of generative form, I'm not referring to the idealistic precession
of the idea but [the [deployment of the generative information]{.mark}
inscribed in the present]{.underline}. A [form that generates forms can
function as a gestalt; the gestalt is a cognitive frame based on the
pre-selection of our perceptive reactions.]{.underline} In The Question
Concerning Technology, Heidegger writes that 'the essence of technology
is by no means anything technological. Technology is a way of
revealing.' **[The '[cognitive frame' frames the world.]{.mark} The
gestalt allows us to see, while simultaneously [preventing the vision of
anything]{.mark} that does not comply with the gestalt.]{.underline}**
Gestalt and Tangle According to the gestalt psychologists (namely
Wertheimer, Koffka and Kohler), [[perception is shaped by]{.mark} the
[relation between perceptual stimuli]{.mark} that we receive from the
surrounding environment and generative forms inscribed in our mind. The
gestalt is enabling our vision, but simultaneously entangles our ability
to see something different. **[Morphogenesis is]{.mark} here [opposed
to]{.mark} generation: by generation I mean [the process of producing
objects according to a format.]{.mark} By [morphogenesis I mean the
emergence of forms]{.mark} that are [not inscribed]{.mark} in the
present constitution of the world.** Generation implies the subjection
of the content to the potency of the existing structure. Power is the
domination of the gestalt, the grid that makes invisible what exists at
the state of possibility: the entangler.]{.underline} In order to
actualize a possibility, **[a [disentangling potency is needed]{.mark}.
Potency [enables the subject to deploy the possibility inscribed in its
composition]{.mark}, to organize the body without organs]{.underline}**.
**[Disentanglement [is the emancipation of content from the form that
contains it,]{.mark} and the full deployment of the potencies belonging
to social knowledge.]{.underline}** Only by [dissociation (not by
contradiction) can different forms emerge from the magma.
Gestalt]{.underline} can be seen as a double bind: it [simultaneously
gives us the potency of seeing something, while impeding us from seeing
something else.]{.underline} In Bateson's double bind, in fact, the
[context frames the message in such a way that the receiver misreads the
message because of the influence of the context.]{.underline}
Schismogenesis is the methodology that Bateson suggests to get free from
the double bind, in order to refer to the self-organization that follows
when content is dissociated from its entangling form, as well as to the
**[[proliferation by contagion (]{.mark}affective, informational,
aesthetic contagion) of the new form that is generated by the
schism]{.underline}**. In the contemporary historical condition, a
question arises: is disentanglement still possible, when the mind of the
social organism has been so deeply infected by the viral proliferation
of double binds? And another: what is the origin of this proliferation
of double binds in the social mind? [I [do not see capitalism as a
subjectivity, but as a]{.mark} gestalt whose action is [structuring
knowledge]{.mark}, labour and resources according to a semiotic
gestalt.]{.underline} When we look at a visual form, the [present
[structure of our mind deciphers]{.mark} the visual [stimulation]{.mark}
according to gestalts that are inscribed in our mind, and it is quite
difficult for us to see something other than the form that our mind is
accustomed to seeing.]{.underline} Wittgenstein writes that '[the limits
of our language are the limits of our world'. In terms of gestalt and
possibility, Wittgenstein's statement means that our **[language is a
syntactic organization]{.mark}** of the uncountable contents that belong
to the field of our experience.]{.underline} From this range of possible
organizations of the contents, [our language selects a plan of
consistency and enforces this plan]{.underline} so that it is
[linguistic organization that limits our possibilities of experience and
perception.]{.underline} But if language is a limit, this implies also
that [there are more possibilities beyond that limit. I would call
disentanglement any **[linguistic creation that may be deemed an
'excess': poetry is the linguistic activity that exceeds the limits of
our language]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The [production of war signs]{.mark} is linked to the issue of war not
only in matters ofcontent, but also in m[atters of form.]{.mark}
Content-wise, [war is just one of many fields in which reality signs are
produced]{.mark}; regarding its form, however, it is the [pure logic of
war itself that works in this industry]{.mark}. The production of
reality for Baudrillard is a kind of warfare itself: Not only is it a
monologue of power, a "speech without response", as he states in
Requiem]{.underline} for the Media (1971: 172); even more, the
"terrorism of the code" (ibid.: 179) is a [war-like attack on our
senses]{.underline}. We, the [[viewers, are targets of a bombardment of
signs]{.mark} and images.]{.underline} "Semiocracy", Baudrillard (1976:
78) calls this terror in his writing on the New York Graffiti scene: [we
live under a dictatorship of signs ([against which]{.mark} the [Graffiti
raise their anti-semiotic counterforce]{.mark}).]{.underline} The w[ar
sign industry is just one of many subdivisions of a society-wide
'reality sign industry' that [floods our lives with all kinds of
spectacular products and information]{.mark}]{.underline}."We are all
[[hostages of media intoxication]{.underline},]{.mark} [induced [to
believe in the war]{.mark} just as we were once led to believe in the
revolution in Romania]{.underline}, and confined to the simulacrum of
war as though confined to quarters. [We are already all strategic
hostages in situ;]{.underline} our site is the screen on which we are
virtually bombarded day by day" (Baudrillard 1991b: 25). Finally now,
this is where Baudrillard's genuine theoretical intervention takes
place. [Like the Graffiti writers, Ba[udrillard attempts to fight back
against the terrorism of the code]{.mark} and its work of
purification---somehow continuing Graffiti writing by other
means.]{.underline} Baudrillard is leading his own war, his own
[counter-guerilla warfare against the reality principle]{.underline}.
What are his spray cans? Which are the walls on which he puts his 'mark
on society'? I[t is [the holy walls of theoretical discourse]{.mark}
that Baudrillard [defaces with]{.mark} a low tech weapon called
"[theoretical terrorism]{.mark}"]{.underline}, as he called it once
(Baudrillard 1983a: 91, my translation)---a thinking made to oppose, to
[challenge the hegemony of reality.]{.underline} The idea of
'[theoretical terrorism' is strongly linked to his concept of
"reversibility]{.underline}"[13](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote13)
---a key term in Baudrillard's thinking. The [term may be characterized
by two main aspects: At first, it refers to the [reciprocity of gift
exchange]{.mark} in which there is no closure of exchange but an endless
changing and challenging of sides. In this regard, it is a [name for the
symbolic fluidity of
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}[14](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote14)
At second, it refers to a [principle of [changing a situation by
radically reversing its viewing angle]{.mark}]{.underline}---"poetic
transference of the situation", as Baudrillard calls it in Impossible
Exchange (1999: 85). [Being a rather "phantastic principle]{.underline}"
(Zapf 2010: 145, my translation), the [concept of reversibility is
linked with the most powerful and yet most clandestine subtext in
Baudrillard's oeuvre: ['Pataphysics]{.mark}. The idea behind this absurd
science of "imaginary solutions"]{.underline} is as simple as it is
mysterious: It is an [[attempt to create a different reality through
imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}.[15](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote15)
Pataphysicians [[fight reality through the use of imaginary
forces]{.mark}, through [creating illusion]{.mark} and
deceit.]{.underline} It is easily overlooked how central this
pataphysical approach has been for Baudrillard; even his most serious
book, Symbolic Exchange and Death, is surprisingly full of pataphysical
statements, especially in the dense, programmatic introductory pages:
"The only strategy against the hyperrealist system is some form of
pataphysics, 'a science of imaginary solutions'; that is, a
science-fiction of the system's reversal against itself at the extreme
limit of simulation, a reversible simulation in a hyperlogic of death
and destruction" (Baudrillard 1976: 4 f.). How can "science-fiction"
shatter the system of reality? Baudrillard explains his strategy later
in The Perfect Crime (1995), especially in the section on "Radical
Thought", and in Impossible Exchange (1999). Ideas, he claims, can
creat[e their own reality, since [thinking is a performative act that
builds its own 'parallel world': "Thought]{.mark} \[...\] [does not seek
to penetrate]{.mark} some [mystery]{.mark} of the world, nor to discover
its hidden aspect---it is that hidden aspect. It does not discover that
the world has a double life---it is that double life, that parallel
life]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1999: 149). In the [performative "act of
thinking]{.underline}" (ibid.: 115), [reality is not so much depicted
but challenged. The purpose of [theory]{.mark} for Baudrillard
[is]{.mark} the [exact opposite of what we normally would
expect]{.mark}: It [should not recognize]{.mark} and analyze
[reality]{.mark}, instead it must deny and contradict its
hegemony.]{.underline} It has [to [create illusion]{.mark} and establish
a power of seduction that makes one lose the path of reality. The "value
of thought",]{.underline} claims Baudrillard (1995: 94), "[lies not so
much in its inevitable convergences with truth as in the immeasurable
divergences which separate it from truth]{.underline}." Only in
awareness of those abstract 'Pataphysics can we distill any sense out of
some of the oddest remarks in Baudrillard's oeuvre, for example his
"delirious self-criticism" from Cool Memories where he accuses himself
of "having surreptitiously mixed my phantasies in with reality" and of
"having systematically opposed the most obvious and well-founded
notions" (Baudrillard 1987: 38). He even complains about readers taking
his theories for actual facts and reading them in a "realist version":
"Simulacra are today accepted everywhere in their realist version:
simulacra exist, simulation exists. It is the intellectual and
fashionable version of this vulgarization which is the worst: all is
sign, signs have abolished reality, etc." (Ibid.: 227). Instead of this
"realist version", Baudrillard suggests that [even his most prominent
terms can be regarded as pataphysical attempts to seduce his readers
through fictitious ideas, for example when he admits to having "put
forward the idea of simulacrum, without really believing in it, even
hoping that the real will refute it"]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995:
101). Apparently he understands [his thinking to be [something like a
playful simulacrum itself, for also theory can precede---and thereby
seduce---reality]{.mark}: "The theoretical ideal would be to set in
place propositions in such a way that they could be [disconfirmed by
reality]{.mark}, in such a way that reality could only oppose them
violently, and thereby unmask itself.]{.underline} For r[eality is an
illusion, and all thought must seek first of all to unmask it. To do
that, it must itself [advance behind a mask and constitute itself as a
decoy]{.mark}, without regard for its own truth]{.underline}. \[\...\]
[[Reality must be caught in the trap]{.mark}, we must mo[ve quicker than
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}" (ibid.: 99). In this sense, Baudrillard's
writing is "[theory-fiction]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1991c: 202)
[rather than theory]{.underline}, as he borrows a term from
Jean-François Lyotard (1979: 92 f., cp. Blask, 2002: 133). Like all
'Pataphysics, this notion of "theory-fiction" m[ay be traced back to the
surrealists and their "[poetic anthropology]{.mark}]{.underline}", as
Dietmar Kamper (1981, my translation) has called it. [Such an
anthropology is "poetic" because it [refers to the art of
writing]{.mark}, but also because it touches the original notion of
"poiesis", meaning to create something. 'Poetic anthropology' [does not
seek to describe a reality that lies out there]{.mark}, instead it aims
to autopoietically produce the subject it writes about through its own
act of description.]{.underline} Theory for Baudrillard is a
"[paradoxical political intervention]{.underline}" (Zapf 2010: 241, my
translation). [Thinking itself has to become the ambiguous kind of
"singularity]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1995: 96) and "event" (ibid.:
104) that [is eliminated from almost any other sphere of the system:
"Cipher, do not decipher. Work over the illusion. [Create illusion to
create an event. Make enigmatic what is clear,]{.mark} render
unintelligible what is only too intelligible, make the event itself
unreadable. [Accentuate the false transparency of the world]{.mark} to
spread a terroristic confusion about it, or the germs or viruses of a
radical illusion---in other words, a radical disillusioning of the
real."]{.underline} (Ibid.: 104). Maybe this is the most unique aspect
of Baudrillard's thinking altogether. He is a thinker who tries to think
the world different from what it actually is. He sees himself as
something like a smuggler or drug dealer, pushing forbidden items on a
"black market in thought" (Baudrillard 1999: 104), promoting "a
clandestine trade in ideas, of all inadmissible ideas, of unassailable
ideas, as the liquor trade had to be promoted in the 1930s" (Baudrillard
1995: 104 f.). If Baudrillard is the drug dealer of sociology, what does
this imply for his analysis of war and his reference to the principles
of symbolic exchange and the duel form? If we want to believe
Baudrillard that he is not interested in rehabilitating older wars, we
should read his reference systematically rather than
historically[16](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote16)---there
might have never been any historical war as glamorous and honorable as
portrayed by Clausewitz anyway. Hence, the [introduction of [symbolic
exchange]{.mark} and the duel principle into the analysis of war might
be more like a [strategy to introduce a different view of things into
the common perception of war]{.mark}. It delivers the necessary
[contrast against]{.mark} which [the aestheticized,]{.mark} whitewashed
[reality]{.mark} of the war can be scrutinized and deconstructed as not
the only possible reality of war. Only in the light of its radical other
can the reality of war be denaturalized and revealed as a self-display
of power and hegemony.]{.underline} In this regard, [Baudrillard has
always remained a critical thinker who seeks to intervene into reality
instead of just observing it. To the same degree he is neither a cynic
nor a fatalist, that is---a resigned thinker]{.underline}. On the
contrary, in an interview on the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center
he even aligns himself with the ideas of the Enlightenment: "Fatalism
offers an unpalatable interpretation of the world, for it leads to
resignation. I don't resign myself, I want clarity, a lucid
consciousness. When we know the rules of the game, then we can change
them. In this respect, I am a man of the Enlightenment" (Baudrillard
2002b). There is one major difference, though, between Baudrillard and
the classical Enlightenment: He wishes for "clarity" and lucidity, he
wants to "know the rules of the game", but he does [not seek the truth;
he wants to "[change" the rules of the game by diverting the game from
its truth.]{.mark}]{.underline} It does [not seem to matter so much to
Baudrillard if his instance of contrast---symbolic exchange and the duel
principle---is more fictitious or real, illusionary or
true;]{.underline} most possibly it has something of both sides, being
[undecidable like a simulacrum in the strongest sense. When Baudrillard
writes about the Gulf War, he creates an odd mixture of lucid
observations on the one hand and theoretical seductions on the other. If
there could ever be something like 'war studies' in the spirit of
Baudrillard, they would have to dare not to eliminate this
undecidability, otherwise they would lose the spirit. What matters the
most for Baudrillard is the effort to [break open the uniform process of
reality production and shatter its seeming self-evidence into
pieces]{.mark}. Theory according to Baudrillard is an attempt to
[reverse our view of the world---shifting our perspective by introducing
something new and unsettling into the order of things.]{.mark} What
seemed natural before, now starts to look artificial; what presented
itself as a glorious triumph suddenly appears stale; what was evident
becomes shady. Baudrillard's theories are like evil ghosts: They haunt
reality by staging its excluded other---no matter if this other really
exists or if it has to be feigned.]{.underline}

### Liberation Liquidated

#### Liberation is liquidated and their revolution is terminally non-unique. There is no longer a risk of political change as all movements have already happened -- The only revolutions left are simulated copies of the originals that fail to actualize change. The ROB is to answer the question of what do we do now after the orgy is over 

**Baudrillard, 93** (Jean, The Transparency of Evil: Essays on Extreme
Phenomena, 1993)

[If I were asked [to characterize]{.mark} [the present state of
affairs]{.mark}, I [would]{.mark} [describe]{.mark} it [as \'after the
orgy\' .]{.mark} [The orgy]{.mark} in question [was]{.mark} the moment
[when modernity exploded upon us]{.mark}, [the moment of
liberation]{.mark} in every sphere . [Political liberation, sexual
liberation, liberation of the forces of production, liberation of the
forces of destruction, women\'s liberation, children\'s liberation,
liberation of unconscious drives, liberation of
art]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The assumption of all models of
representation, as of all models of anti-representation. [[This was a
total orgy an orgy of the real]{.mark}, the rational, the sexual, of
criticism as of anti-criticism, of development as of the crisis of
development.]{.underline} We have pursued every avenue in the production
and effective overproduction of objects, signs, messages, ideologies and
satisfactions . [[Now everything has been liberated]{.mark}, the chips
are down, and [we find ourselves]{.mark} faced collectively [with the
big question: WHAT DO WE DO NOW THE ORGY IS OVER?]{.mark}]{.underline}
Now [[all we can do is simulate the orgy]{.mark}, simulate liberation.
We may [pretend to carry on in the same direction]{.mark},
[accelerating]{.mark}, [but in reality we]{.mark} are
[accelerat]{.mark}ing in [a void]{.mark}, because [all the goals]{.mark}
of liberation [are]{.mark} already [behind]{.mark} [us]{.mark}, and
because what haunts and obsesses us is being thus ahead of all the
results - the very availability of all the signs, all the forms, all the
desires that we had been pursuing.]{.underline} But what can we do? This
is the state of simulation, a state in which we are obliged to replay
all scenarios precisely because they have all taken place already,
whether actually or potentially. [[The state of utopia]{.mark} realized,
of all utopias realized, [where]{.mark}in paradoxically [we]{.mark} must
continue to [live as though they had not been]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
since they have, and since we can no longer, therefore, nourish the hope
of realizing them, we can only \'hyper-realize\' them through
interminable simulation. [We live amid the interminable reproduction of
ideals, phantasies, images and dreams which are now behind us, yet which
we must continue to reproduce in a sort of inescapable
indifference]{.underline}. The fact is that the revolution has well and
truly happened, but not in the way we expected. [[Everywhere what has
been liberated has been liberated so that it can enter a state of pure
circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, so that it can go into orbit. With the
benefit of a little hindsight, we may say that the unavoidable goal of
all liberation is to foster and provision circulatory networks. The fate
of the things liberated is an incessant commutation, and these things
are thus subject to increasing indeterminacy, to the principle of
uncertainty. [[Nothing]{.mark} (not even God) now [disappears by]{.mark}
coming to an end, by [dying]{.mark}. [Instead]{.mark}, things [disappear
through proliferation or contamination]{.mark}, by becoming saturated or
transparent, because of extenuation or extermination, or as a result of
the epidemic of simulation, [as a result of their transfer into the
secondary existence of simulation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rather than a
mortal mode of disappearance, then, a fractal mode of dispersal.
[[Nothing]{.mark} [is]{.mark} truly [reflected]{.mark} any more -
[whether]{.mark} in [a mirror]{.mark} [or]{.mark} in the [abyssal
realm]{.mark} (which is merely the endless reduplication of
consciousness).]{.underline} The logic of viral dispersal in networks is
no longer a logic of value; neither, therefore, is it a logic of
equivalence. [[There is no]{.mark} longer any such thing as a
[revolution]{.mark}\" of values - merely a circumvention or involution
of values]{.underline} . A centripetal compulsion coexists with a
decentredness of all systems, an internal metastasis or fevered
endogenic virulence which creates a tendency for systems to explode
beyond their own limits, to override their own logic - not in the sense
of creating sheer redundancy[, but in the sense of an increase in power,
a fantastic potentialization whereby their own very existence is put at
risk.]{.underline}

## To Finish

**Baudrillard 81** (Jean Baudrillard, deader than most dead Frenchies,
1981, *Simulacra and Simulation*, pp 35-9, *translated by Sheila Faria
Glaser*)

Yet, despite this deterrence by the orbital power - the nuclear or
molecular code - events continue at ground level, misfortunes are even
more numerous, given the global process of the contiguity and
simultaneity of data. But, subtly, they no longer have any meaning, they
are no longer anything but the duplex effect of simulation at the
summit. The best example can only be that of the war in Vietnam, because
it took place at the intersection of a maximum historical and
\"revolutionary\" stake, and of the installation of this deterrent
authority. What meaning did this war have, and wasn\'t its unfolding a
means of sealing the end of history in the decisive and culminating
historic event of our era?

Why did this war, so hard, so long, so ferocious, vanish from one day to
the next as if by magic?

Why did this American defeat (the largest reversal in the history of the
USA) have no internal repercussions in America? If it had really
signified the failure of the planetary strategy of the United States, it
would necessarily have completely disrupted its internal balance and the
American political system. Nothing of the sort occurred.

Something else, then, took place. This war, at bottom, was nothing but a
crucial episode of peaceful coexistence. It marked the arrival of China
to peaceful coexistence. The nonintervention of China obtained and
secured after many years, Chinas apprenticeship to a global modus
vivendi, the shift from a global strategy of revolution to one of shared
forces and empires, the transition from a radical alternative to
political alternation in a system now essentially regulated (the
normalization of Peking - Washington relations): this was what was at
stake in the war in Vietnam, and in this sense, the USA pulled out of
Vietnam but won the war.

And the war ended \"spontaneously\" when this objective was achieved.
That is why it was deescalated, demobilized so easily.

This same reduction of forces can be seen on the field. The war lasted
as long as elements irreducible to a healthy politics and discipline of
power, even a Communist one, remained unliquidated. When at last the war
had passed into the hands of regular troops in the North and escaped
that of the resistance, the war could stop: it had attained its
objective. The stake is thus that of a political relay. As soon as the
Vietnamese had proved that they were no longer the carriers of an
unpredictable subversion, one could let them take over. That theirs is a
Communist order is not serious in the end: it had proved itself, it
could be trusted. It is even more effective than capitalism in the
liquidation of \"savage\" and archaic precapitalist structures.

Same scenario in the Algerian war.

The other aspect of this war and of all wars today: behind the armed
violence, the murderous antagonism of the adversaries - which seems a
matter of life and death, which is played out as such (or else one could
never send people to get themselves killed in this kind of thing),
behind this simulacrum of fighting to the death and of ruthless global
stakes, the two adversaries are fundamentally in solidarity against
something else, unnamed, never spoken, but whose objective outcome in
war, with the equal complicity of the two adversaries, is total
liquidation. Tribal, communitarian, precapitalist structures, every form
of exchange, of language, of symbolic organization, that is what must be
abolished, that is the object of murder in war - and war itself, in its
immense, spectacular death apparatus, is nothing but the medium of this
process of the terrorist rationalization of the social - the murder on
which sociality will be founded, whatever its allegiance, Communist or
capitalist. Total complicity, or division of labor between two
adversaries (who may even consent to enormous sacrifices for it) for the
very end of reshaping and domesticating social relations.

\"The North Vietnamese were advised to countenance a scenario for
liquidating the American presence in the course of which, of course, one
must save face.\"

This scenario: the extremely harsh bombardments of Hanoi. Their
untenable character must not conceal the fact that they were nothing but
a simulacrum to enable the Vietnamese to seem to countenance a
compromise and for Nixon to make the Americans swallow the withdrawal of
their troops. The game was already won, nothing was objectively at stake
but the verisimilitude of the final montage.

The moralists of war, the holders of high wartime values should not be
too discouraged: the war is no less atrocious for being only a
simulacrum - the flesh suffers just the same, and the dead and former
combatants are worth the same as in other wars. This objective is always
fulfilled, just like that of the charting of territories and of
disciplinary sociality. What no longer exists is the adversity of the
adversaries, the reality of antagonistic causes, the ideological
seriousness of war. And also the reality of victory or defeat, war being
a process that triumphs well beyond these appearances.

In any case, the pacification (or the deterrence) that dominates us
today is beyond war and peace, it is that at every moment war and peace
are equivalent. \"War is peace,\" said Orwell. There also, the two
differential poles implode into each other, or recycle one another - a
simultaneity of contradictions that is at once the parody and the end of
every dialectic. Thus one can completely miss the truth of a war:
namely, that it was finished well before it started, that there was an
end to war at the heart of the war itself, and that perhaps it never
started. Many other events (the oil crisis, etc.) never started, never
existed, except as artificial occurrences - abstract, ersatz, and as
artifacts of history, catastrophes and crises destined to maintain a
historical investment under hypnosis. The media and the official news
service are only there to maintain the illusion of an actuality, of the
reality of the stakes, of the objectivity of facts. All the events are
to be read backward, or one becomes aware (as with the Communists \"in
power\" in Italy the retro, posthumous rediscovery of the gulags and
Soviet dissidents like the almost contemporary discovery, by a moribund
ethnology, of the lost \"difference\" of Savages) that all these things
arrived too late, with a history of delay, a spiral of delay, that they
long ago exhausted their meaning and only live from an artificial
effervescence of signs, that all these events succeed each other without
logic, in the most contradictory, complete equivalence, in a profound
indifference to their consequences (but this is because there are none:
they exhaust themselves in their spectacular promotion) - all
\"newsreel\" footage thus gives the sinister impression of kitsch, of
retro and porno at the same time - doubtless everyone knows this, and no
one really accepts it. The reality of simulation is unbearable - crueler
than Artaud\'s Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create
a dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of
blood, of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a
reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood. For us the
trick has been played. All dramaturgy, and even all real writing of
cruelty has disappeared. Simulation is the master, and we only have a
right to the retro, to the phantom, parodic rehabilitation of all lost
referentials. Everything still unfolds around us, in the cold light of
deterrence (including Artaud, who has the right like everything else to
his revival, to a second existence as the referential of cruelty).

# Answers to Baudrillard

## Cap Link

#### Baudrillard's nihilistic understanding of class struggle [actively ensures]{.underline} that we will leave the Earth [a smoldering pile of ash]{.underline} -- it's reductionist, ignores history, is just him rambling, and misunderstands failure -- don't let the 1AR's [edgy rhetoric]{.underline} distract you from the fact that they justify an [absurd amount of material violence]{.underline}. 

**Zavarzadeh 95** Mas'ud \[educated in Middle Eastern, European, and
American universities and teaches critical theory at Syracuse
University. He has written on postmodern critical theory and is the
author of Mythopoeic Reality and coeditor of Theory, Pedagogy,
Politics\] "Post-Ality: Marxism and Postmodernism" 1995.

Two questions can be considered under this heading: (a) [Does
Baudrillard present a compelling case against the project of
revolutionary class struggle?]{.underline} (b) Does he present an
acceptable alternative? (a) [We have seen that [Baudrillard holds
that]{.mark} the idea of a [revolution furthering the interests of the
working class]{.mark}es [is senseless]{.mark} today. His argument was
that [in the age of hyperreality]{.mark} the very concept of [class
becomes a]{.mark} "[parody]{.mark}," a "retrospective
simulation."]{.underline} Baudrillard does not really claim that there
are no classes today, but only that class struggle is useless. He holds
that there is no dialectic within the present epoch that could possibly
point to socialism's being on the historical agenda. "Once capital
itself has become its own myth, or rather an interminable machine,
aleatory, something like a social genetic code, it no longer leaves any
room for a planned reversal; and this is its true violence" (1987, 112).
[[Arguments for]{.mark} the inevitable [success of socialism are surely
suspect]{.mark}. But [are arguments for th]{.mark}e inevitability of the
[failure of socialism any less suspect?]{.mark} Baudrillard's case for
the thesis that capital "no longer leaves any room for a planned
reversal" appeals to the fact that in the industrialized West the labor
union apparatus has been integrated into the bourgeois order.
"Strikes\...are incorporated like obsolescence in objects, like crisis
in production]{.underline}\... There is no longer any strikes or work,
but\...a scenodrama (not to say melodrama) of production, collective
dramaturgy upon the empty stage of the social" (1987,48). [[The wild
extrapolation here is transparent.]{.mark} [From the present relative
passivity]{.mark} of the labor movement, [Baudrillard jumps to the
conclusion that all]{.mark} capital/[wage labor confrontations]{.mark}
in principle [can never be more than the mere simulation of conflict. He
completely rules out]{.mark} in principle [any possibility of there ever
being dissident movements]{.mark} within the labor movement [that
successfully unite workers]{.mark} with consumers, [women, racially
oppressed groups]{.mark}, [environmental activists, and so on]{.mark}
[in a common struggle]{.mark} against capital. He completely rules out
in principle the possibility of [a dynamic unfolding of this struggle to
the point where capital's control]{.mark} of investment decisions [is
seriously]{.mark}, [called into question]{.mark}. He makes a wild
extrapolation from the fact that these things are not on the agenda
today to the conclusion that in principle they cannot ever occur. [To
say that he fails to provide any plausible arguments]{.mark} for such a
strong position [is to put things far too mildly]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For a Marxist, capitalism remains a contradictory system.
[Baudrillard]{.underline} is correct when he states that some phenomena
of contemporary capitalism make struggles for social change more
difficult (for instance, the proliferation of electronically transmitted
images celebrating hyperconsumerism). However, he [fails to see that
such things are systematically connected to other sorts of phenomena
that may have quite different implications, such as increasing
stratification, increasing extraction of surplus-value through job
speed-ups, environmental degradation, the gradual delegitimation of
established political parties, and so on.]{.underline} By overlooking
the contradictions that pervade contemporary capitalism, Baudrillard is
blind to the possibility that [[capitalism remains vulnerable to crises
and to social movements]{.mark} aiming at its
transformation.]{.underline} (b) [[Baudrillard's alternatives to]{.mark}
organized struggle against [capital are hyperconformism and defiance.
Examples]{.mark} of the former [range from yuppies]{.mark} who
accumulate the latest electronic gadgets with the proper demeanor of hip
irony]{.underline}, to the crack-dealing B-Boys whose obsession [[with
designer labels]{.mark} and [BMWs]{.mark} simulates the hypermaterialism
of the very system that has destroyed their communities. [Rampant
hyperconformism]{.mark} of this sort [may]{.mark} very [well lead the
system to implode]{.mark}, from the waste, environmental damage, and
community disintegration imposed by hyperconsumerism. [The only problem
is that by the time]{.mark} this implosion occurs [it may be too late
for the human species to pick up the pieces.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Baudrillard's crypto-existentialist odes to defiance perhaps present a
more attractive option. However, these odes romanticize defeat. They
honor the memory of rebels not for the heroism exemplified in their
defeats, and not for the lessons that can be learned from those defeats.
It is the defeats themselves that meet with Baudrillard's approval, the
fact that the rebels were "acting out (their) own death right a way\...
instead of seeking political expansion and class hegemony." This form of
implosion is like a fireworks display that brilliantly illuminates the
landscape when it goes off, only to dissolve at once, leaving everything
immersed in darkness as before. And this form of implosion is an option
for suicide. In my view, neither of Baudrillard's proposals provides a
satisfactory alternative to revolutionary Marxism, however unfashionable
the latter may be today. (284)

## At Baudrillard

#### Postmodern theories eschew objective accounts of reality that get coopted and prevent unified resistance to capitalism 

**Clark 8** Byron Clark, Writer for Fight Back. "A Marxist Critique of
Postmodernism." August 25, 2008.
<https://fightback.org.nz/2008/08/25/a-marxist-critique-of-postmodernism/>

If you're an Arts student then theres no doubt that you will have
encountered the term 'postmodernism' at some point during your time at
university, perhaps though you haven't been given an explanation of this
school of thought or perhaps more likely you've had it explained to you
by ten different people- probably in twelve different ways. [[Its this
**confusion on what postmodernism actually is**]{.mark} [that
makes]{.mark} any attempt at [critiquing it so difficult. In the
intellectual discussions]{.mark} that can be found outside campus cafés
[one arguing against postmodernism will soon hear from their opponent
"**no thats not what postmodernism is**]{.mark}!" at which point the
discussion becomes a frustrating argument about semantics]{.underline}
usually ending with someone dismissively scoffing "bloody undergrads"
and walking away. [No doubt this article will draw similar
responses]{.underline}, however I'm going to attempt to define
postmodernism as accurately as I can, based on the impressions of it I
have gained in the course of my university education, as well as though
my own study, and then outline my criticism of it. Let me first state
that if you're inclined to use the word 'postmodern' to describe
architecture (indeed this was the original use of the word), a piece of
art, music or your latest haircut, then my argument is not with you.
Refer to contemporary art however you like, and it doesn't worry me, my
argument here is against the philosophy of postmodernism, a collection
of ideas that I see as having negative consequences in our society.

[Pomo; what the hell is it?]{.underline}\
This is not an easy question to answer, a quick look at the Wikipedia
article on postmodernism will show a graphic stating that the article is
in need of an expert to come clean it up, and the article itself is of
little help. Its not unreasonable that no one in Wikipedia's volunteer
community is a postmodernism expert, arguably there are few pomo
'experts' in existence. [Even the well known linguist Noam Chomsky, a
man who the New York Times has referred to as "One of the greatest
intellectuals of our time" seems to have trouble getting his head around
it;]{.underline} "There are lots of things I don't understand --- say,
the latest debates over whether neutrinos have mass or the way that
Fermat's last theorem was (apparently) proven recently. But from 50
years in this game, I have learned two things: (1) I can ask friends who
work in these areas to explain it to me at a level that I can
understand, and they can do so, without particular difficulty; (2) if
I'm interested, I can proceed to learn more so that I will come to
understand it. Now \[postmodernist theorists\] Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard,
Kristeva, etc. --- even Foucault...write things that I also don't
understand but (1) and (2) don't hold: no one who says they do
understand can explain it to me and I haven't a clue as to how to
proceed to overcome my failures" (Chomsky, ca.1995). Baring this in
mind, I ask you to accept this somewhat simplified deffinition that I
will use for the sake of this argument.

[[Postmodernism is the idea that there is no objective truth,]{.mark}
because the way we perceive the world is constructed by our society, and
in particular by language, and if this is the case, can we really know
what reality is? **[If all truth is subjective, then what is true
really?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Some postmodernists draw from this the
conclusion that what we perceive is real, or at least real to the
individual, leading to a sort of philosophical idealism where, for
example, a postmodernist on a walk through the park would say "I
perceive that that tree over there exists, ergo, it does." Not everyone
who subscribes to the Pomo school of thought would take it this far, but
some do (this will be discussed bellow in the section about Alan Sokal).
First though, I will argue my philosophical objection.

**[[The materialist criticism]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
The Marxist literary critic Fredric Jameson has argued, along with
others, that o[[ur perception of reality is a reflection of the existing
material world,]{.underline}]{.mark} he did this in a complex and
pleonastic way in his book Postmodernism, or, the cultural logic of late
capitalism. To save you reading about philosophical materialism, I'll
sum it up with an analogy; Jameson, on a walk though the park with our
postmodernist friend would say "that tree exists, so you perceive it as
existing." For Jameson, the areas most analysed by postmodernist
theorists, namely culture and society (lets call this [the
'superstructure']{.underline}) [can not be fully understood when
separated from the material economic base of that society]{.underline}
(lets call this 'base') although there is certainly a fair deal of
social construction going on within the superstructure, any society is
shaped by the relations of production and exchange (economics) that form
its base. This is an argument that any clued up Marxist (such as this
author) would subscribe to.

Now, there is a chunk of ideas which are tied in with postmodernism that
I would agree with. [Is our perception of the world shaped by language?
Most definitely, for an example take the use of the word "class" in New
Zealand's political discourse, its seldom mentioned at all, and when it
is its usually preceded by the word "middle]{.underline}." As such, when
The Listener did a feature article on 'class' in New Zealand its
research showed that most New Zealanders (83%) see themselves as "middle
class" (Black, 2005) [Would the postmodernists argue that this idea of a
New Zealand with a tiny working class and tiny ruling class and a
massive bulge in the middle is simply a perception, a subjective truth
at best?]{.underline} Well [they probably would]{.underline}, yet would
they point out that 'class' in its true meaning, is the distinction
between those who own the means of production, distribution and exchange
(the ruling class) and those who work for them (the working class) and
would they point out that a particular class has an interest in people
perceiving our society the way most of those questioned by The Listener
did? (we're all just one big middle class!) sadly the answer is no.
[[For the postmodernists, **the very idea of social class is merely one
of the many truths that are not true**- after all, everything is
subjective right?]{.underline}]{.mark} [This same idea in common in
postmodernist thought the world over]{.underline}, so we get for
example, British historian David Cannadine claiming that In the
eighteenth century "there was no 'class'" in part because "Karl Marx was
not alive and around to tell them this was who they were and what they
were doing" (Cannadine, 1998, p.24).

Consequences of the denial of class\
It is here that Jamesons work becomes more than just a book to read so
you can say things like "look, just don't even talk to me about
postmoderism until you've read Jameson" next time you're hanging with
the cafe intellectuals, because [he highlights the political
ramifications of this way of thinking; "[These are not merely
theoretical issues; they have **urgent practical political
consequences**]{.mark}, as is evident from the conventional feelings of
First World subjects that existentially]{.underline} (or "empirically")
they really [do inhabit a "postindustrial society" from which
traditional production has disappeared and in which social classes of
the classical type no longer exist]{.underline} -- a conviction which
has immediate effects on political praxis" (Jameson, 1991, p.53)

The term 'postindustrial society' seems to be one enjoyed by the
postmodernists, (industry is so, urgh, modern) but it is a misnomer,
[[the world today is more industrialised than ever before]{.mark},
thanks the rapid growth and proliferation of third world sweatshops
during the past three decades or so]{.underline}. To take the the view
that our society (speaking globally) is "postindustrial" is incredibly
Western-centric. Even in Western societies the service economy does not
make class irrelevant, the fast food worker is still working to create
wealth for the owners of the restaurant chains, and could not survive
without selling his or her ability to work. Not to mention that as the
fast food industry was built on Taylorist ideas of production line
efficiency even the idea of 'industry' in the West is not irrelevant
either (see for example, Schlosser, 2001).\
[[Postmodernism doesn't mean that social class doesn't exist, **it just
means we all pretend it doesn't.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Further, [the
very ideology of [postmodernism makes a fight back against capitalisms
increasing dominance of our lives stunted.]{.mark} In an example of what
I mean by this, prominent anti-capitalist journalist Naomi Klein,
writing of the influence of corporate marketing in universities stated
that most academics were "preoccupied with their own postmodernist
realization that truth itself is a construct]{.underline}. [This
realization made it intellectually untenable for for many academics to
**even participate in a political argument that would have "privileged"
any one model of learning (public) over another
(corporate)"**]{.underline} (Klein, 2000, p.116).

The Sokal hoax\
Postmodernism's critics also come from the sciences; [in 1996 [physicist
Alan Sokal was "troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of
intellectual rigo]{.mark}r in certain precincts of the American academic
humanities]{.underline}" and decided to try an experiment: [[Would a
leading North American journal of cultural studies]{.underline}]{.mark}
(whose editorial collective ironically included Fredric Jameson)
[[publish an article]{.mark} "liberally [salted with nonsense]{.mark}?"
**To his surprise the answer was [yes]{.mark}**[. His article]{.mark}
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of
Quantum Gravity]{.underline}" [[declared "without the slightest
evidence]{.mark} or argument, [that "physical \`reality']{.mark} \[note
the scare quotes\] ... [is]{.mark} at bottom [a]{.mark} social and
[linguistic constru]{.mark}]{.underline}[ct']{.mark}" (Sokal, 1996).
Writing of his hoax he asked rhetorically "Is it now dogma in Cultural
Studies that there exists no external world?" and invited "anyone who
believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions...to try
transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment."
(ibid) [Why did Sokal attempt to publish his nonsense article? Well, his
[criticisms of postmodernism are similar]{.mark} to the ones I've
already outlined and are worth quoting at length; "my concern over the
spread of subjectivist thinking is both intellectual and
political]{.underline}. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines
is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). **[[There is a
real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts
and evidence do matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What sane person would
contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing
consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths --- the
utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and
pretentious language." (ibid)

Conclusions\
While there are many brilliant academics in the world who are using
their skills to benefit society, [the dominance of the intellectual
elitism (and sheer nonsense) that Chomsky, Klein and Sokal have
mentioned is of grave concern.]{.underline} Chomksy wrote is his
critique of postmodernism "[[The left intellectuals who 60 years ago
would have been teaching]{.mark} in working class schools, writing books
like "mathematics for the millions]{.underline}" (which made mathematics
intelligible to millions of people), participating in and speaking for
popular organizations, etc., [[are now largely disengaged]{.mark} from
such activities, \[they\] are not to be found, it seems, when there is
such an obvious and growing need and even explicit request for the work
they could do out there in the world of people with live problems and
concerns"]{.underline} (Chomsky, ca.1995).

I worry for my generation, those of us who are students in New Zealand
universities today are going to go on to become the next generation of
intellectuals, yet we are a generation that grew up in the
post-Rogernomics years, taught to look out for our individual interests,
to think of ourselves as consumers rather than workers, and promised
jobs in the wonderful postindustrial 'knowledge economy.'
[[Postmodernism teaches us to ignore the reality we live in,
and]{.mark}, by masking itself in obscure and pretentious language,
[creates **a wedge between intellectuals and the**]{.mark} **worlds
[masses]{.mark} of working people**]{.underline}. Its a way of thinking
that almost seems made to fit the political situation of our time. [When
looking at how we are taught to think in our modern (or is that
postmodern?) late capitalist society, its important we consider just
who's interests our way of thinking serves.]{.underline}

#### The liberal order is [better]{.underline} than alternatives, and can be [revised]{.underline} to [remedy illiberal elements]{.underline}, but the [total]{.underline} absence of it [greenlights]{.underline} Trumpian excesses 

**Simpson 18**

Emile Simpson, Research fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows,
formerly a British Army officer, "There's Nothing Wrong With the Liberal
Order That Can't Be Fixed by What's Right With It." Foreign Policy.
August 7, 2018.
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/07/theres-nothing-wrong-with-the-liberal-order-that-cant-be-fixed-by-whats-right-with-it/>

**[[Is the liberal international order]{.underline}]{.mark}** under
attack by the Trump administration **[[worth
defending]{.mark}?]{.underline}** That's the question raised by a series
of recent articles by prominent realist
commentators---including [Patrick
Porter](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/world-imagined-nostalgia-liberal-order), [Paul
Staniland](https://www.lawfareblog.com/misreading-liberal-order-why-we-need-new-thinking-american-foreign-policy), [Graham
Allison](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-06-14/myth-liberal-order),
and [Stephen M.
Walt](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/01/why-i-didnt-sign-up-to-defend-the-international-order/).
Their answer, in short, is no. They make some good points, but there are
fundamental problems with their critique.

[The realists offer two arguments: that the liberal international order
is a myth that never was, so the idea of defending it is an
illusion]{.underline} anyway, [or that this order
overreached]{.underline} in the post-Cold War era as the United States
tried to make the world in its own image, causing failures that should
not be repeated, whether endless wars or mass outsourcing of blue-collar
jobs abroad.

Taken together, **[these two views are contradictory]{.underline}**:
[You can't criticize the failures of liberal international order if it
never existed;]{.underline} President Donald [Trump is either attacking
it, or he is not.]{.underline} There is a further incoherence in the
fact that the [[realists complain about]{.mark} [U.S. imperial overreach
but]{.mark} display the same zeal as the neoconservatives in
[dismiss]{.mark}ing [as irrelevant the rules of liberal international
order that **might restrain the very excesses**]{.mark} **of U.S.
foreign policy [they criticize.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

I do agree with the realist critique of liberal international order on a
fundamental point: that globalization has overshot since the end of the
Cold War (as
I [argued](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/19/this-is-how-the-liberal-world-order-ends/)before
Trump was elected). To my mind, the most serious problem is that, while
free markets have expanded rapidly to cover most of the globe,
democratic governance has not advanced in tandem. As I have
also [written](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/26/globalization-has-created-a-chinese-monster/) about
in the context of China, the paradigm case, it is now virtually
undeniable that there is no necessary connection between capitalism and
democracy.

During the Cold War, authoritarian capitalist regimes existed, too, and
did so within the "free world," but the West could argue that supporting
them was the lesser evil: Indonesia under Suharto was hardly North
Korea. Now that argument can no longer be made, because virtually all
states plug in to the same free-market system, even if they play it
differently---take China's state-owned enterprise model,
for [example](https://www.ft.com/content/ddb1fa0e-8ff7-11e8-9609-3d3b945e78cf).
Thus, a key reason for China's rise is that much of its overseas
activity has been perfectly legal, at least on the surface: buying
ports, mines, agriculture, and other states' sovereign debt; building
massive infrastructure projects; and so on.

In short, global markets and the legal rules that support them are the
most entrenched aspect of the liberal international order. But it's
entirely legitimate---and I'd argue, accurate---to criticize the
labeling of market liberalization as "liberal" whenever free markets are
not accompanied by free people. There is nothing hypocritical in
distinguishing between the international order as a whole and those
parts of it that are, to varying degrees, liberal.

The integration of global markets illustrates only one area regulated by
the global legal system, a prominent aspect of the international order.
(The international order is also regulated by its political and social
conventions, although their content is more subjective.) If you want
proof of the legal dimension of international order, look at what
happens when a state wants to move from one set of rules to another, as
with Brexit, where the majority of the debate concerns legal rules.

Of course, [all legal rules express deeper power
structures]{.underline}, be they military, economic, or cultural. So,
[to refer to international order as being rules-based does not entail
commitment to a utopia of [rules unmoored]{.mark} from the realities of
power]{.underline}: Strong states clearly influence the rules more. And
certain bodies of rules within this order are plainly violated more
frequently than others---for example, those concerning the use of force.
But **[those [are]{.mark} still [exceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
[[Most states don't invade one another most of the time, and when
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has **[respected
international]{.mark} legal [rules]{.mark}** in this area, [such as in
the Persian Gulf War]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the results have been
better]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than in cases where it did
not]{.underline}, such as in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Rather than explain these points away as anomalies, I would recognize
them as [evidence of the fragility and [limitations]{.mark} of the
liberal]{.underline} dimensions of the international
[order]{.underline}. But that recognition **[[does not imply that the
liberal order has no value]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [All states, after
all, have interests that they cannot achieve on their own and so need to
develop rules for working together.]{.underline}

This is a point that [even the realist skeptics of liberal international
order are prepared to concede **[when it comes to issues like]{.mark}
[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Both Allison and
Walt,]{.underline} for example, [express regret that the United States
pulled out of]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} climate change
agreement---**[a classic instrument of international law.]{.underline}**
Yet [their view that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should not
have pulled out of]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} agreement contradicts the
claim that international rules are pointless]{.underline}. [The same can
be said for their regret that that Washington pulled out the Iran
nuclear agreement.]{.underline}

Rather than emphasize the contradiction, I would emphasize the
[realists' common ground with liberal internationalism]{.underline},
which [could be extended to other global problems: money laundering,
offshore tax evasion, human trafficking]{.underline}, and so on. In
short, if the realists didn't express such hostility to the theory of
consensual international cooperation, they would likely support many of
its specific expressions.

Finally, [while I accept the realist view that the West should not try
to make the world in its own image]{.underline} by involuntarily
pressing its values on others through the barrel of a gun, [that doesn't
mean that liberal powers shouldn't push for global rules that
instantiate liberal values.]{.underline} Accommodating others does not
mean giving up your own values; it just means recognizing their proper
limits, on a case by case basis.

Indeed, this is **[what the [realists]{.mark} get the most wrong in
their tendency to [fetishize power over all else]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Politics and political order are downstream from culture, and the power
of the United States ultimately rests on its values.]{.underline} [The
Cold War was not merely about bare power, but two ideas of what
constitutes a just society. The problem since the end of the Cold War
has been that the United States has no clear standard to define its
values against,]{.underline} not least because it has not pushed back
against the disjuncture of capitalism and democracy now evident whenever
autocrats get the benefits of access to the West and Western investment
without signing up to its values.

With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that, since the early 1990s,
the West has traded material gain for damage to its own values. Now we
are seeing the backlash. Don't believe me? Just look at all the corrupt
offshore money in London property, making prices unaffordable for
ordinary, hardworking young people, and wonder why many of them have
lost faith in capitalism. [[Values matter]{.mark} in international
order, [and we]{.mark} can [only see that **if we reject the realists'
amoral blinkers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Ultimately, **[[peace requires]{.mark} a combination of [stability and
justice]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the Roman Empire collapsing around
him in the fifth century A.D., and contemplating a new order, Augustine
writes in The City of God: "[Anyone, then, who is rational enough to
prefer right to wrong and order to disorder can see that the kind of
peace that is based on injustice, as compared with that which is based
on justice, does not deserve the name of peace.]{.underline}" In other
words, **[[there's nothing wrong with the international order, and its
liberal dimensions, that can't be fixed by what's right with
it.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Simulacra are, by definition, indistinguishable from real events.
Nevertheless, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} actual existence and [constant
[possibility of simulacra are **not sufficient causes** for adopting
reality agnosticism]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may be impossible to
distinguish the fake holdup and fake sickness from the real holdup and
real sickness, but the child has really been sick and most criminals are
not playing. Those involved in staging the act of simulation itself do
mostly know the difference. But Baudrillard would rightly point out
that, from the outside, for those of us confronting simulacra
phenomenologically (instead of making them), our general inability to
tell the difference means that we can never be too confident about
reality. [Reality [agnosticism ]{.mark}]{.underline}is tantamount to
[[treat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [every event as a possible
simulacrum]{.underline}. [This is the same as to treat **[no events as
real]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This is precisely what Baudrillard wants to
do, yet [I think [this is a **mistake**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Baudrillard presses us to recognize that even suffering and death can be
and have been simulated (i.e. the Timisoara Massacre in 1989 in Western
Romania, where protestors were gunned down by the army. While the
massacre was real, it was later disclosed that 27 bodies were exhumed
from the Timisoara \" Paupers\' Cemetery\" to exaggerate the massacre
for TV effect. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} series of events marked the
end of Ceausescu's Stalinist regime in Romania.) . .l2 However, despite
such manipulation. we do live in a world where suffering and death are
real. [That even suffering and death could be staged, and that we cannot
always tell when that is the case [does not mean that we should make
such suspicion into]{.mark} an [**operational
logic**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [there is always the other side, the
side of actual suffering and death.]{.underline} [[Baudrillard makes too
much out of the fake,]{.underline}]{.mark} and he errs on the wrong side
[of the equation]{.underline}. What I mean by saying \"too much\"\" and
\"wrong side\", is precisely to raise a normative objection. Wherever we
cannot tell the difference (that is, [wherever there are]{.underline}
functional [simulacra]{.underline}), [I contend that [**we should err**
on the side of]{.mark} a]{.underline} different obligation. And this is
indeed a moral [[obligation to take]{.mark} human [suffering
seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[an obligation that
outweighs]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the integrity of **[Baudrillard\'s
skepticism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To put it bluntly, [I would
rather be fooled into thinking]{.underline} a [faked death was real
than]{.underline} that a [real death was faked[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For **[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark}** later writings to be
sustainable, two conditions have to be met. First, Baudrillard's
terrorism --- his attempt to communicate
**[[hyperreality]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the reader immediately,
allowing the crystal its revenge --- must be theoretically coherent and
possible. Second, his description of hyperreality as a unique
transformation of culture, in which an external social reality is
eclipsed in the vivid representations of the screen, must be an accurate
account of recent developments. The most sympathetic reading of
Baudrillard's later writings is to read them as literature, as Turner
and Mike Gane do.26 This is a legitimate strategy so long as what is
produced is literature. In other words, in demanding that he **[[is no
longer writing sociology]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Baudrillard is
committing himself to being judged by the equally rigorous, though
different standards, which are applied to creative prose. This is where
he falls into difficulties, for his later writing cannot really be said
to be creative prose. They retain their academic form and still seek to
provide a commentary on hyperreality. **[[They do not open up a
fragmented world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[but rather stand back from
that world, offering detached criticisms and generalizations about
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Baudrillard does not communicate the
vertiginous flicking from one television channel to the other, but
comments on the meaning of these changing images. Like the academic he
remains, Baudrillard makes claims about the general features of this
culture, rather than using narrative to communicate a message, as is
typical in literature. Moreover, there is no divide between Baudrillard
and the narrative itself; there is no ironic use of character or
detachment from the text. His writing is merely an earnest but stripped
form of academic writing, which moves from asserted claim to claim,
rather than from sustained claim to claim for the slow but rigorous
building of an argument.27 Once his obscure lexicon is deciphered, and
readers realize that by "code" and "matrix" [[Baudrillard refers
to]{.mark} the fact that [hyperreal culture]{.mark} simply lives off
itself]{.underline}, never coupling with a reality beyond itself, then
his sentences become assertive and static. [[The only point he makes is
that television culture is hyperreal]{.underline}]{.mark} --- signifiers
now float free --- and the only way in which this sentence communicates
that point is by positing these crude metaphors of "code" and "matrix."
Stylistically, [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}'s terrorism [[baldly
states]{.mark} [that]{.mark} contemporary [culture is like]{.mark} a
hologram, a code, **[a matrix]{.mark}** or clone, because it is wholly
self-referential but it does not actually communicate what it is like to
experience this culture]{.underline}. Compare this style of writing with
J. G. Ballard's Crash --- a novel providing a very successful (and
deliberately obscene) description of postmodern culture. It recognizes
that culture's bodily indulgence, and knows that it does not liberate
the individual but reduces the body to a machine for pleasure, just as
the car is a machine for speech. The car-crash and the sexact are the
moments when the wholly technical machineries of the car and the bodies
are decomposed in an instant of pain that is transformed (for ironic
effect) into one of intense pleasure for the perverts who populate the
book. In communicating this new, debased ethic of bodily pleasure, where
the delight in bodily mutilation parallels a correlating spiritual
disfigurement, Ballard describes a questionnaire about car crashes which
Vaughan, the central figure in the book, has prepared and which lists
every conceivable injury: "Lastly came that group of injuries which had
clearly most preoccupied Vaughan --- genital wounds caused during
automobile accidents. . . . the breasts of teenage girls deformed by
instrument binnacles, the partial mammoplasties of elderly housewives
carried out by chromium louvres of windshield assemblies, nipples
sectioned by manufacturers' dashboard medallions; injuries to male and
female genitalia caused by steering wheel shrouds, windshields during
ejection, crushed door pillars, seat springs and handbrake units,
cassette player instrument toggles."28 The descriptions Ballard provides
of both cars and bodies are wholly technical and anatomical, emphasizing
that, in this culture, both "bodyworks" are (obscenely) reduced to the
same level. Against Ballard's rich, selfdeveloping text, Baudrillard's
writing is flat and strained. He simply breaks down his academic text
into aphoristic gobblets and draws on a lexicon of dead, static
metaphors. In the end, [Baudrillard falls between the two stools of
demanding that academic writing is inadequate to the analysis of
hyperreality, but still writing according to its conventions and thereby
vitiating]{.underline} either [the academic]{.underline} or the literary
[merit of]{.underline} his later [work]{.underline}. However, even if
Baudrillard wanted his later writing to be read as literature and even
if he had been successful in producing text which could be judged as
literature, the project of this later writing would still have been
irretrievably self-deluded. Even if his terrorism were a successful form
of literature, it could never (as he claims) communicate hyperreality to
the reader directly, for all writing is necessarily mediated; all
writing is an interpretation.29 [[Unavoidably, his]{.underline}]{.mark}
terroristic [[writing]{.underline}]{.mark} is an interpretation of
hyperreal culture, which **[[does not obviate the necessity of
interpretation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[however directly it tries to
communicate hyperreality.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**If they're right, then distortion is [so strong]{.underline} that it's
immutable. Better to act within it.**

[[Ironically, in trying to present hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}
immediately, [[Baudrillard falls into]{.mark} exactly [the same
error]{.mark}]{.underline} for which he so effectively criticized Marx.
Just as Marx failed to provide a truly radical alternative to capitalism
by employing the concepts of capitalist political economy,
[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} fragmented [aphorisms are [**unable
to provide a critical alternative** to hyperreality, because they are so
thoroughly embedded]{.mark}]{.underline} in and dependent on the very
cultural forms they are intended to oppose. The fragmentation of
[Baudrillard]{.underline}'s later writing [does not serve the critical
purpose]{.underline} for which [it]{.underline} was [intended, but
rather, **if [it has any effect]{.mark}**, [it sensitizes the reader to
the global media]{.mark} culture [Baudrillard wanted to
resist]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His attempt to portray]{.underline} a
[culture in which allegedly there is no]{.underline} longer any
[reality]{.underline} beyond its representations, **[is the academic
extension of that culture]{.underline}**. Contrary to his own
intentions, [[it]{.mark} is the very]{.underline} intellectual
[path]{.underline} he has insisted on taking, which turns its back on
careful research and close critical analysis, which
[[makes]{.underline}]{.mark} the desert of [[hyperreality grow]{.mark}.
It]{.underline} robs the reader of any critical understanding of
contemporary culture. Moreover, [it denies the import]{.underline}ance
[of developing alternative knowledge and understandings]{.underline},
[which would undermine media representations]{.underline} of the world
[because it asserts that these]{.underline} alternative visions [would
always already be incorporated into hyperreality.]{.underline} It is not
enough simply to say that television is a false reality; [one must try
and reconstruct a reality in which political freedom and critique are
possible]{.underline}, even though any constructed reality must itself
always be subjected to critique. Consequently, [against
Baudrillard[,]{.mark} [an appropriate]{.mark} form]{.underline} of
academic [[resistance]{.mark} [would be to insist
upon]{.mark}]{.underline} even [**[more rigorously researched]{.mark}**
and detailed [work]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 In particular, the
dialectical method [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} demands the constant
overhaul of concepts, whereby nothing is taken for granted,
[[would]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[Baudrillard from falling into]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[hyperbolic]{.mark}]{.underline} reification of mere
[[assertions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Alt Fails]{.underline}**

**They link to themselves. The alternative can only result the
imposition of the neutral play their kritik criticizes**

**Baudrillard 76** (Jean, "Symbolic Exchange and Death", p. 74)

[[The consummate enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark} \[jouissance\] [[of
**the signs of** guilt, despair, violence and death are **replacing**
guilt, anxiety and even death in **the total euphoria of
simulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This euphoria aims to abolish cause
and effect, origin and end, and replace them with reduplication. [[Every
closed system **protects itself**]{.mark} in this way [from]{.mark} the
referential and the [anxiety of the referentia]{.mark}l, as well as
[**from all metalanguage** that the system wards off by **operating its
own metalanguage**]{.mark}, that is, [by **duplicating itself as its own
critique**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In simulation, [[the]{.mark}
metalinguistic [illusion reduplicates and **com­pletes the referential
illusion**]{.mark} (the pathetic hallucination of the sign and the
pathetic hallucination of the real).]{.underline}

**[Perm]{.underline}**

**Bridging the gap between modernist and postmodernist critique via the

The term postmodern is disappearing from the vocabularies of ex- cluded
groups, social scientists, humanist intellectuals, scholars of all
kinds. But postmodern terms and concepts remain very much alive and in
constant use. Postmodernism is disappearing because of its relativis-
tic connotations and because, by accepting the corpus of the postmod-
ern perspective, a group with a political agenda places its own position
in jeopardy. For those drawn to the postmodern critique, who have po-
litical, cultural, social, and/or economic agendas, including feminists
and ethnic and cultural groups, postmodern concepts are an extremely
effective weapon to discredit and delegitimate modernism, the status
quo, and colleges and universities as they are now constituted. How-
ever, [[if the metanarratives of modernism and higher education have no
philosophical foundation, the metanarratives of marginal and excluded
groups do not have essentialist foundations either]{.underline}.]{.mark}
This is what engen- ders the profound ambivalence toward postmodernism
of those who are most critical of the current modernist world. [By
avoiding the term \"postmodernism\" and by declining to identify oneself
as a postmodern- ist, critics may and do continue to use the terminology
of postmodern- ism, while retaining their own necessary metanarratives
to justify their political, cultural agendas]{.underline}. [If [we
accept the implications of postmodernism and see it as a cri- tique that
applies both to modernists and to those critical of modern- ism, we can
reach a point]{.mark} where the postmodern stricture [to listen]{.mark}
and listen very hard and long [to the \"other\"]{.mark} has strong
credibility. If neither side has any foundational credentials, **[there
is space for real and contin- uing dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
result of such listening and the pursuit of dialogue under such
conditions [could mean the retention in universities and col- leges of
the values of merit, community, and autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
their justification in Rorty\'s terms, on the basis of agreement that
these are, in some form, even as the particulars are contested, an
integral part of our higher education heritage. [For the excluded
\"others\" this kind of dia- logue could well provide the basis for
changing the meaning and terms of merit, community, and autonomy in ways
that are satisfactorily in- clusive and representative of the plurality
of \"others\"\' cultures and poli- tics]{.underline}. Currently, [we are
precariously poised between a modern/ postmod- ern incommensurable
hostility and the conditions for tough authentic dialogue.]{.underline}
In higher education our course is clear. **[[We need to increase and
sustain the dialogue, even as we acknowledge that the tension will not,
and perhaps should not, be resolved]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Impact]{.underline}**

**The idea of hyperreality is a byproduct of postmodernism, not a
description of it---their strategy can't escape the academy and their
claims about the world require truth claims which is a double turn with
Baudrillard's theory**

and Public and International Affairs, "A critique of Baudrillard's

As Jameson (1984) has argued, the emergence of multinational, consumer
(and, increasingly, post-Fordist) capitalism from the 1960s has
facilitated the development of postmodern culture which opposes the
restrictiveness of modern culture. In the light of the new demand for
consumption, a cultural superstructure has emerged which emphasizes the
indulgence of those very spheres - such as sexuality - which were deemed
dangerous under the productive Protestant ethic of modernity (Lash,
1991: 42). [[Postmodernity is]{.mark}, then, above all [a culture of
transgression which seeks to breach the cultural boundaries]{.mark} and
taboos [of modernity and to revel in]{.mark} the [ecstatic
liminality]{.mark} of the once restricted]{.underline}. Jameson
describes this postmodern transgression of the categories of modernity
(which is linked to a new consumerist ethic) in his celebrated
examination of the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. There Jameson
describes the vertiginous feelings which the individual experiences due
to the curious use of space in the foyer of that hotel. Postmodern
hyperspace has transcended the capacities of the individual human body
to locate itself, to organise surroundings, to map its position in the
mappable world. (Jameson, 1991: 44) The foyer of the Bonaventure Hotel
undermines the certainties and categories of modernist architecture. The
rationality of modern architecture which strictly and functionally
demarcated and divided space is replaced by buildings which deliberately
disorientate individuals and ask them to question their sense of space.
Postmodern architecture, then, subverts the ordered categories of modern
architecture and, in that way, Jameson's Bonaventure Hotel stands as a
shining example of postmodernism and its transgression of the
restrictive rational categories and boundaries of modernity[. This
notion of postmodernity as the transgression of the cultural categories
which were a central element of modernity and intrinsically connected to
the capitalist economy from the Industrial Revolution to the 1960s
facilitates a dialectical supersession of Baudrillard's concept of
hyperreality for [Baudrillard's hyperreality can]{.mark}, in this
context, begin to [be seen not as a critical insight into wider
postmodern processes but rather as the epistemological and intellectual
aspect of those very processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like the boundaries
which would subsequently be drawn up against sexuality, madness and the
Other, Cartesian rationalism analogously drew up a rigorous bulwark
against the epistemological liminality which threatened Descartes at the
start of his Meditations. As I have argued, [[hyperreality is the moment
when Descartes' extreme doubt has returned to the academy and we once
again find ourselves in the epistemological void of scepticism]{.mark}
where we can know nothing. [Baudrillard's descent into this]{.mark}
Cartesian [void epistemologically matches the transgression of modern
categories]{.mark} which can be witnessed in many cultural
spheres]{.underline} l Like consumer culture, which subverts the
repressive modern norms of sexuality in a demand for liberation,
[Baudrillard rejects the rational and certain boundaries]{.underline} of
Cartesian 'clear and distinct ideas' [[and resigns himself to the 'deep
whirlpool' of nothingness, although this transgression is for
Baudrillard a moment of profound disillusion rather than
liberation**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It marks a moment of transgression
where the categories of Truth, certainty and objectivity are
transgressed in the pursuit of nihilism, which was from the outset
conceived as the dangerous and liminal Other for modern rationalism.
[**[This epistemological nihilism is an example of postmodernism, in
which there are no more rules and in which anything goes.]{.underline}**
**[Not only is this nihilism critically bankrupt, but it is possible
only if the pursuit of an objective Truth is regarded as possible and
desirable in the first place]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. A dialectical and
linguistic approach could never have posited the existence of a final
Truth in the first place and this approach has been similarly untroubled
by fears of an epistemological void.]{.underline} [For dialectical and
linguistic sociology which situates itself consciously in a Heideggerian
paradigm, [linguistic reality is enough in itself - it is not final but
neither is it in need of some metaphysical support]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Heideggerian tradition allows us to situate Baudrillard's
hyperreality dialectically and to find it sociologically useful, even in
the light of the latter's abject theoretical poverty.

**Debate is separate from the hyperreal and solves the aff.**

**Robinson 12 --** (Andrew, "An A to Z of Theory -- Jean Baudrillard and
Activism: A critique", 2012)

Baudrillard's theory of [deterrence needs to be
reconsidered]{.underline} in light of recent events. We have seen in
2011 that [[it is still possible to create events]{.underline}:]{.mark}
the London unrest, the student protests, Occupy, the Wikileaks saga...
[The system does not actually have the power on the ground to prevent
revolts, occupations, movements. Even the system's vice-like grip on
future significations is being partially broken through movements like
Occupy]{.underline}, which conveys different future images in its own
rhetoric[. [Anonymous turns the anonymity of statistical indifference
into a source of strength]{.mark}, using tactics based on the very
vulnerability to excess the system creates]{.underline} -- such as
distributed denial of service attacks (using an excess of web
connections) and leaking of documents (relying on the obscene
overexposure of information in the Internet). [[The
difficulty]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, [[is in sustaining
events]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanding new frames of meaning. The
system monopolises and determines the [effects]{.underline} of events,
and kettles them in time and space. Firstly [the [system controls the
ways in which events are signified]{.mark}]{.underline} to
non-participants. Secondly [the system,]{.underline} having once faced
an event[, [will prepare in detail to prevent it "next
time]{.mark}"]{.underline} -- so it is hard for events to become waves.
And thirdly, [the system [unleashes a dreadful wave of repression
]{.mark}]{.underline}after each event, [attempting to foreclose its
irruptive force]{.underline} and restore the pervasiveness of terror.
Resultant [feelings of futility]{.underline}, anxiety and vulnerability
[are corrosive of movement-building]{.underline} and of repeated cycles
of similar events. The movement of revolt towards a terrain of refusal
of meaning is also partly an effect of the system's move towards coding.
[[The apparent lack of demands]{.mark} in recent waves of social
unrest]{.underline} (e.g. the Mark Duggan uprising, the banlieue revolt,
the Greek insurrection of 2008, the Occupy movement, summit protests),
and even many of today's "terrorists", [[is]{.mark} perhaps [a result of
the prevalence of the code]{.mark}. The presentation of demands risks
reinscription as simply a militant version of a position already
encoded]{.underline} within the system. People respond with actions
which counterpose their own expressiveness to the code. This is also
perhaps why [theorising the conditions of possibility for an Event has
become such a popular theme]{.underline} in contemporary radical theory.
Another possibility could here be added. [[It is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, in open-ended surveys, [[to give
responses deemed too complex to be codable]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
principle[, a more heterogeneous humanity would escape the code through
each individual's irreducibility to prior categories]{.underline}. There
are also certain texts, such as Cabal, Argot and Barbarians, which argue
for [incommunicability as a necessary part of radicalism. [The system
demands that everything communicate in its terms. Therefore, esoteric
language is an effective resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[If there is a transformation in higher education, what should it
be?]{.underline} Is there a need for a set of values that transcend
group values, for a vocab- ulary that will speak to all groups within
the academy? Or should there be a wide open conglomeration of presumably
incommensurate values, ethics, standards? Some poststructuralist thought
seems to indicate that we already have this incommensurability among
discourses. [[The destruction of the belief in eternal
verities]{.mark}]{.underline} and the attenuation of the drive to search
for truth [[mean that higher education\'s task may be to pay much more
attention to values, what they mean, where they come from, what their
function is, and how to forge new values that fit the higher education
world and its mission.]{.mark} Because the borders of colleges and
universities are becoming more permeable in the postmodern
world]{.underline} and the great sustainers of the in- dependence of
higher education, the state and governments, are becom- ing weaker,
institutions need to find ways of maintaining autonomy in the face of
multinational corporate resources and power, the debilitat- ing effects
of the increased proliferation of active interest groups, and the
encroachment of extreme local power. In the world of simulacra and the
power that comes from creating images, [[the universities\' task may be
to seek and sustain a kind of au- thenticity of information and
knowledge.]{.underline}]{.mark} In this it needs to create a con-
sistent and useful concept of merit; it cannot rely as heavily upon the
strictures of science or the rules of a broken canon. [[But it needs to
sus- tain the value of merit and find with all the contradictions, the
plural voices]{.mark}, the lack of a sense of progress, and the
continual tension an in- terest [in]{.mark} and [pursuit of means for
measuring, judging, and rewarding merit]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
boundary between higher education and the market collapses, some means
for organizing and sustaining autonomous sanctu- aries, oases, or
enclaves in universities should be found that do not sim- ply respond to
the drive for performativity and the standards of the market.
[[Institutions of higher education need ways to construct and sus- tain
community, and community at several levels]{.mark}: community on the
campus and community in the larger society, a commitment to citizen-
ship. The emphasis upon the other, the marginal, the outsider, in
postmod- ern thought needs to be kept in the foreground in higher
education]{.underline}. **[[Colleges and universities need to find ways
of encompassing the other, of taking in marginal people and
ideas]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, it should not be done in the
usual liberal strategy of simply adding courses on multinational- ism,
women\'s studies, and cultural studies. These need to be included in
academia more on the basis of their own standards. But the argument here
is that this inclusion does not mean that the search for and crea- tion
of standards of merit is compromised. An important means for en- suring
this is to follow the advice that a number of postmodern writers have
offered, namely, to listen very hard and openly. As Cornell West has
written, \"I hope that we can overcome the virtual de facto segrega-
tion in the life of the mind in this country, for we have yet actually
to create contexts in which black intellectuals, brown intellectuals,
red in- tellectuals, white intellectuals, feminist intellectuals,
genuinely struggle with each other\" \[98, p. 696\]

criticising every rebellion as insufficiently
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If one looks past such problems,
however, there are important implications in Baudrillard's work for
emancipatory practice. Baudrillard's work was clearly an influence on
Negri's early work. Ideas such as the reduction of the system to
command, the spread of diffuse apparatuses of power and the panic of the
system in the face of its own arbitrariness reappear in texts such
as Time for Revolution. The idea of the 'code' or system functioning as
a self-propelled irrational machine is also reminiscent of primitivists
such [as Fredy
Perlman](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Fredy_Perlman__Against_His-story__Against_Leviathan.html).
Baudrillard seems to see the regime of the code as the high-point of
civilisation, in an almost anarcho-primitivist sense. Where he differs
from such analyses is that he sees the core of civilisation not in
technology or the domestication of desire or the 'political principle'
of state power, but in the denial and suppression of symbolic exchange.
Baudrillard is partly thinking through the issue of diffuse power. In
capitalist and statist social regimes, power is immensely concentrated.
He also gives a particular spin to the distinction between expressive
and instrumental. We can link the idea of the 'code'
to [preventionism](http://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Manuskripte/Manuskripte_88.pdf) and
its impact on protest. As discussed above, Baudrillard's idea of
initiatory groups could also be applied to activist 'neo-sects'.
Baudrillard also offers answers to some of the big questions of today
regarding psychological barriers to revolt. The loss of reality might
explain why hope for liberation seems so hard to come by, and why
revolutionary movements now seem to lack a clear vision of
transformation. The [Immediatist
Potlatch](http://hermetic.com/bey/radio_se.html) would be an example of
gift-exchange as political action. Occupation of the remainders and
waste-grounds of cities has been a constant aspect of dissident
practice, from Traveller communities such as Dale Farm and shanty-towns
in the global South, to reclaimed factories used as squats, to projects
such as South Central Farm. Reversibility could also be thought of in
terms of vendettas and cost-imposition. These return to the system the
power it exercises, reversing it. Another useful way to extend
Baudrillard's work is to cross-read it with Open Marxist views of
capitalism as a process which must constantly be reproduced to exist.
Simulation is not a finished process. It has to be constantly repeated
in order to be kept active. The process of deterrence (or
counterinsurgency) is therefore an ongoing process.

Over the past decade, [the "cult of irrelevance" in political science
scholarship]{.underline} has been lamented by a growing chorus (Putnam
2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009). [Prominent scholars of
i]{.underline}nternational [affairs]{.underline} have diagnosed the
roots of the gap between academia and policymaking, [made the case for
why]{.underline} [[political]{.mark} science [research is valuable for
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}, and offered a number of ideas for
enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in international relations
and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, several initiatives have been formed in the attempt
to "bridge the gap."2 Many of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate the findings and
[[implications]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[research to
the policymaking community]{.mark}, a necessary and worthwhile objective
for a field in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and
publishing norms tend more and more toward the abstract and
esoteric]{.underline}. Yet enhancing communication between scholars and
policymakers is only one component of bridging the gap between
international affairs theory and practice. Another crucial component of
this bridge is the generation of substantive research programs that are
actually policy relevant---a challenge to which less concerted attention
has been paid. The dual challenges of bridging the gap are especially
acute for graduate students, a particular irony since many enter the
discipline with the explicit hope of informing policy. In a field that
has an admirable devotion to pedagogical self-reflection, strikingly
little attention is paid to techniques for generating policy-relevant
ideas for dissertation and other research topics. Although [[numerous
articles and conference workshops are devoted to the importance of
experiential and problem-based learning]{.underline}, [especially
through techniques of simulation that emulate policymaking
processes]{.underline}]{.mark} (Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow
2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little has been written about the use
of such techniques for generating and developing innovative research
ideas. This article outlines an experiential and **[[problem-based
approach to developing a political science research program using
scenario analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It focuses especially on
illuminating \[**[[illuminates]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] the research
generation and **[[pedagogical benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}** of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), **[[which brings together]{.mark}
doctoral [students]{.mark} of international and comparative affairs [who
share a demonstrated interest in policy-relevant
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**.3 In the introductory section, the
article outlines the practice of scenario analysis and considers the
utility of the technique in political science. **[We argue that
[scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool to stimulate problem-based
learning]{.mark}]{.underline}** for doctoral students and discuss the
broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help generate research
ideas. The second section details the manner in which NEFPC deploys
scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of the concrete
scholarly benefits that have been realized from the scenario format. The
fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical potential associated
with using scenarios in the classroom across levels of study. A brief
conclusion reflects on the importance of developing specific techniques
to aid those who wish to generate political science scholarship of
relevance to the policy world. What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in
Political Science? [[Scenario analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} is perceived
most commonly as a technique for examining the robustness of strategy.
[It [can immerse decision makers in future states that go beyond
conventional extrapolations of current trends, preparing them to take
advantage of]{.underline}]{.mark} [unexpected [opportunities and to
protect themselves from]{.mark} adverse exogenous
[shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The global petroleum company Shell, a
pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as the art of
considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds. [[Scenario
analysis]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [typically seen as
serving [the purposes of corporate planning or as a policy tool to be
used in combination with simulations of decision
makin]{.mark}g]{.underline}. Yet scenario analysis is not inherently
limited to these uses. This section provides a brief overview of the
practice of scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses.
It then makes a case for the utility of the technique for political
science scholarship and describes how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC
were created. The Art of Scenario Analysis We characterize scenario
analysis as the art of juxtaposing current trends in unexpected
combinations in order to articulate surprising and yet plausible
futures, often referred to as "alternative worlds."
[Scenarios]{.underline} are thus explicitly not forecasts or projections
based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns, and they are
not hypothesis-based expert predictions. Nor should they be equated with
simulations, which are best characterized as functional representations
of real institutions or decision-making processes (Asal 2005). Instead,
they a[re depictions of possible future states of the world, offered
together with a narrative of the driving causal forces and potential
exogenous shocks that could lead to those futures]{.underline}. Good
scenarios [thus rely on explicit causal propositions that, independent
of one another, are plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising
and sometimes controversial future worlds]{.underline}. For example, few
predicted the dramatic fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet
independent driving forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the
United States, China's slowing economic growth, and declining conflict
in major Middle Eastern oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized
secular trends that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take
concerted action as prices began to decline---came together in an
unexpected way. While scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and
strategic planning during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the
contemporary practice are found in corporate futures studies of the late
1960s and early 1970s (Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was
essentially initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization
that the usual forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the
rapidly changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985;
Schwartz 1991). In particular, it had become evident that [straight-line
extrapolations of]{.underline} past [global trends were inadequate for
anticipating the evolving]{.underline} business
[environment]{.underline}. Shell-style scenario planning "helped break
the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that the
future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013, 4).
Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector. Building on
its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with [corporate [scenario
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[technique can be used in foreign
policymaking for long-range general planning purposes as well as for
anticipating and coping with more narrow and immediate
challenge]{.mark}s]{.underline}. An example of the latter is the German
Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses four scenarios to map
the potential consequences of the Euro-area financial crisis (German
Marshall Fund 2013). Several features make scenario analysis
particularly useful for policymaking.5 Long-term global trends across a
number of different realms---social, technological, environmental,
economic, and political---combine in often-unexpected ways to produce
unforeseen challenges. Yet [[the ability of decision makers to
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}, let alone prepare for, [[discontinuities
in the policy realm is constrained]{.underline}]{.mark} by their
existing mental models and maps. This limitation is exacerbated by
well-known [cognitive bias tendencies]{.underline} such as groupthink
and confirmation bias (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982; Tetlock 2005). The power
of **[scenarios]{.underline}** lies in their ability [to **[help
individuals break out of conventional modes of thinking and analysis by
introducing unusual combinations of trends and deliberate
discontinuities in narratives about the future]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Imagining alternative future worlds through a structured analytical
process enables policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something
altogether different from the known present.]{.underline} The
characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to
policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists
generate and develop policy-relevant research programs. **[[Scenarios
are essentially textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us
imagine how the future political-economic world could be different from
the past in a manner that highlights policy challenges and
opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, terrorist
organizations are a known threat that have captured the attention of the
policy community, yet our responses to them tend to be linear and
reactive. Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of
change---the rise of a new peer competitor in the East that diverts
strategic attention, volatile commodity prices that empower and
disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways, and the
destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease
pandemics---can be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the
terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on
recognized states and groups. By illuminating the potential strategic
significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and
threats, [scenario analysis [helps to identify crucial gaps in our
collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and
dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The notion of "exogeneity"---so
prevalent in social science scholarship---applies to models of reality,
not to reality itself. Very simply, scenario analysis can throw into
sharp relief often-overlooked yet pressing questions in international
affairs that demand focused investigation. [Scenarios]{.underline} thus
[offer]{.underline}, in principle, [an innovative tool for developing a
political science research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, achieving
this objective requires careful tailoring of the approach. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the [scenario
discussions]{.underline} themselves, as described below, [lay bare these
especially implausible claims and systematic biases]{.underline}.8 An
[explicit methodological approach underlies the written scenarios
themselves as well as the analytical process around
them]{.underline}---that of case-centered, structured, focused
comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal mechanisms
(George and Bennett 2005). [The]{.underline} use of
[scenario]{.underline}s is similar to counterfactual analysis in that it
[[modifies certain variables in a given situation in order to analyze
the resulting effects]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fearon 1991). Whereas
counterfactuals are traditionally retrospective in nature and explore
events that did not actually occur in the context of known history, our
[scenarios are deliberately forward-looking and are designed to explore
potential futures that could unfold]{.underline}. As such,
counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to identifying how
individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of choices"
available to political actors and thus lead to different historical
outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while [forward-looking scenario analysis
can better illuminate surprising intersections and sociopolitical
dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by fine-grained
historical knowledge]{.underline}. We see scenarios as a complementary
resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs, rather
than as a replacement for counterfactual analysis, historical case
studies, or other methodological tools. In the scenario process
developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed, acting as
cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed below,
includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent hypotheses
about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving international
affairs. The [scenario analysis]{.underline} process itself [employs
templates]{.underline} (discussed further below) [to serve as a
graphical representation of a structured, focused investigation and
thereby as the research tool for conducting case-centered comparative
analysis]{.underline} (George and Bennett 2005). In essence, these
templates articulate key observable implications within the alternative
worlds of the scenarios and serve as a framework for capturing the data
that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994). Finally, this [structured,
focused comparison serves as the basis for the cross-case session
emerging from the scenario analysis that leads directly to the
articulation of new research agendas]{.underline}. The scenario process
described here has thus been carefully designed to offer some guidance
to policy-oriented graduate students who are otherwise left to the
relatively unstructured norms by which political science dissertation
ideas are typically developed. The initial articulation of a
dissertation project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal
undertaking (Useem 1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose
topics based on their coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or
the topics studied by their advisors. Research agendas are thus
typically developed by looking for "puzzles" in existing research
programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral students also, understandably, often
choose topics that are particularly amenable to garnering research
funding. Conventional grant programs typically base their funding
priorities on extrapolations from what has been important in the recent
past---leading to, for example, the prevalence of Japan and Soviet
studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism studies in the 2000s---in the
absence of any alternative method for identifying questions of likely
future significance. The scenario approach to generating research ideas
is grounded in the belief that these traditional approaches can be
complemented by identifying questions likely to be of great empirical
importance in the real world, even if these do not appear as puzzles in
existing research programs or as clear extrapolations from past events.
The [[scenarios analyzed]{.underline}]{.mark} at NEFPC envision
alternative worlds that could develop in the medium (five to seven year)
term and [[are designed to tease out issues scholars and policymakers
may encounter in the relatively near future so that they can begin
thinking critically about them now]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This timeframe
offers a period distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into
current events analysis, but not so far into the future as to seem like
science fiction]{.underline}. In imagining the worlds in which these
scenarios might come to pass, [participants learn strategies for
avoiding failures of creativity and for overturning the assumptions that
prevent scholars and analysts from anticipating and understanding the
pivotal junctures that arise in international affairs.]{.underline}

Even as it raises serious challenges for models and practices of a
multiple public sphere, neoliberalism does not dispense with publicity.
Indeed, [[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} in its various forms
[[circulates among the]{.mark} nodes of a **networked [public
sphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Neoliberalism
challenges]{.underline} modes of critical [publicity by aligning publics
with its **own vision of individuals** and their
interactions]{.underline}. Recalling the presumption of a bourgeois
public[, a neoliberal public **disregards difference** and **discounts
inequality** to reassert a singular and **universal model of
publicity**]{.underline}. To the degree to which it exerts force across
a network, [a neoliberal public obfuscates the diversity of the network
in which it circulates]{.underline}. [A neoliberal public]{.underline}
exhibits distinct qualities and [assumes alternative functions than a
networked public sphere operating with a dynamic public]{.underline}
good. To understand this neoliberal public, we first must recognize that
scholars have used the term neoliberalism to refer to related but
multiple developments and objects. Engaging the wide-ranging
contemporary scholarship on the topic, Simon Springer observes that four
prominent versions of neoliberalism circulate in the literature:
neoliberalism as domi- nant ideology; neoliberalism as policy framework;
neoliberalism as state form; and neoli- beralism as mode of
self-governance.39 As Springer notes, these versions may overlap. If we
understand ideology as a set of political beliefs and principles, then
we may discern a form of neoliberalism in the discourse of advocates who
champion the superiority of markets. Yet, this very example lends itself
to a policy program of privatization, and it reimagines the state
through a market model. While the qualities and functions of a neo-
liberal public link to these variations, public sphere scholars may
offer a distinctive contribution by considering how [neoliberalism[, as
a dominant social force]{.mark}, [shapes]{.mark} the [**subjectivities**
of people]{.mark} who act in the public sphere as well as their
perceived and]{.underline} 40 [enacted relations to one
another]{.underline}. [[The figure of an **atomized individual** stands
at the center of a neoliberal public]{.underline}.
[I]{.underline}]{.mark}[n]{.underline} his 1962 book [Capitalism and
Freedom]{.underline}, Milton [Friedman opened with an unequivocal
assertion]{.underline} of the place of the individual: To the free man,
[the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, **not
something over and above them**]{.underline}. \... ~~He~~ [\[they\]
recognizes no national purpose except as it is the consensus of the
purposes for which the **citizens severally strive**]{.underline}. 41 n
rebuking \"something over and above\" individuals, in denying shared
purpose, [Friedman gainsaid [the existence of **coordinated action**
as]{.mark} anything other than [an infringement on individual
prerogative]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Whereas public sphere
scholars]{.underline} like Hannah Arendt have [discerned a power in
human relationships that \"springs up between Ipeoplel]{.underline} when
they act together, [Friedman denied this potentiality]{.underline}.
Elected officials, too, have voiced this indi- vidualist orientation. In
his first inaugural address, President Ronald Reagan recast the
progressive narrative of the American Dream \"to privilege the
individual as the hero, rather than the community. \"43 Like Friedman,
Reagan grounded his view of the nation in individuals, and he did so in
celebratory terms. At other times, censure has replaced celebration when
individuals fail to reach their economic goals, or even economic survi-
ability, since individuals alone bear the responsibility for their
actions. Writing about the circulation of the \"mortgage delinquent\" in
the 2008 housing market crisis in the United States, Megan Foley
explains that this figure enforced neoliberal self-discipline by
scolding debtors to \"grow up, take responsibility, and repay their
loans.\" At the same time, this figure \"minimized the scope of the
mortgage crisis by pinning the blame on \'irresponsible\' individuals
who made \'risky\' financial decisions. Just as an emphasis on an
atomized individual denies coordinated action, it occludes structural
deficiencies. [In a [neoliberal public sphere]{.mark}, individuals may
exercise the fundamental value of freedom,]{.underline} defined
generally as the ability of individuals to act as they please without
coer- cion or constraint, [but **narrowly imagined** as the freedom of
market actors.]{.underline} Recalling a lineage of classical liberalism,
Friedman upheld \"freedom as the ultimate goal and the indi- vidual as
the ultimate entity in society.\" 45 Freedom supposedly brought
limitless possibi- lities---individuals could decide best how they would
live their lives; what they valued; with whom they would interact and
how. However, [in [flattening society in the image of the
market]{.mark}, Friedman and other neoliberals restricted freedom to the
freedom of market actors]{.underline}. 46 [Democratic connotations of
freedom as self-rule or \"**participation in rule by the
demos**,\"]{.underline} notes Brown, [gave \"way to comportment with a
**market instrumental rationality** that radically **constrains** both
**choices and ambitions**]{.underline}. \... [No longer is there an open
question of **how to craft the self**]{.underline}.\"47 In this shift,
freedom also dissociates from other demo- cratic values like equality
and justice. Illuminating the implications of this move, Friedman
contrasted the virtuous action of the free individual against the
paternalistic and coercive actions of the state. [Any
effort]{.underline} by governing institutions [to seek equality and
pursue justice could never be genuine]{.underline} because it required
the imposition of state control on the free will of individuals. As Paul
Turpin notes, Friedman presented a stark choice: [either
citizens]{.underline} 48 [could defend freedom or submit to state
control and, ultimately, totalitarianism]{.underline}. However, as I
discuss below, [Friedman and other neoliberals supported state action
when they regarded it as serving the market]{.underline}. [Unable to
draw on coordinated action for social change, [the]{.mark} neoliberal
public [subject]{.mark} only may [act as an individual to **change
oneself in the image of the market.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [In]{.mark}
this manner, [neoliberalism **redirects** social concerns
**inward**]{.underline}. [Operating as a competitive market
actor]{.underline} does not occur naturally; rather, [individuals must
develop their **competitiveness**]{.underline}. Pierre Dardot and
Christian Laval explain that [the neoliberal subject must work on
oneself constantly **\"to survive competition.\"**]{.underline} Success
requires consideration of one\'s activities as \"an investment, a cost
calculation. The economy becomes a personal discipline. Dardot and Laval
maintain that the self-improvement of the neoliberal subject does not
constitute an exercise in delayed gratification; one does not mold
oneself as a market actor to accumulate the financial means for
self-fulfillment in a non-market activity later in life. Work appears as
its own end. [Neoliberalism \"makes work the privileged vehicle of
self-realization: it is by succeeding professionally that one makes a
\'success\' of one\'s life]{.underline}.\"50 [**[Neoliberalism
subsumes]{.mark}** other motivations and goals, such as obtaining an
**[education]{.mark}** or cultivating a **friendship**, [under **the
singular framework of maximizing one\'s competitive
advantage**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} An individual economic actor, [the
neoliberal public subject appears as a \"**universal**\" that obfuscates
its **own particularity** as well as the challenges faced by those who
cannot **seamlessly identify with its mode of
subjectivity.**]{.underline} On the question of gender, as Brown
suggests, [neoliberalism both **ignores** and **exacerbates** the
difficulties that women face in adopting the position of **homo
oeconomicus**]{.underline}, since women remain disproportionately
responsible for the familial activities that neoliberalism regards as
outside of the market. In this way, neoliberalism both intensifies and
transforms a gendered division of labor. Intensification appears in the
privatization of public infrastructures that support families and
children. Transformation occurs through erasure of a public language for
identifying and addressing the unequal impact of neoliberal policy
change. As Brown writes, \"women both require the visible social
infrastructure that neoliberalism aims to dismantle through
privatization and are the invisible infrastructure sustaining a world of
putatively self-investing human capitals.\" 51 For Nancy Fraser, this
subjugation appears in the language of emancipation, as neoliberal
policy co-opts the feminist critique of the traditional roles of
breadwinner and homemaker. Supplanting the gendered \"family wage\" of
the post-World War Il era in Western economies, neoliberal policy
romanticizes \"female advancement and social justice\" but undermines
the very conditions and infra- structure necessary for advancement and
justice.52 On a global scale, observes Rebecca Dingo, neoliberalism sets
\"women on a path toward formal market activities without recognizing
the wide-reaching vectors of oppression and exploitation that impoverish
women. \"53 In these ways, policymakers have championed markets as a
universal prescrip- tion for national and international development
without regard to context and conditions of exploitation.
[[Neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} also [i[gnores the role of]{.mark}
**race** and **[racism]{.mark}** o[n the formation and agency of
**public subjectivities**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[A neoliberal
public]{.underline}**, as Darrel Wanzer-Serrano observes, [operates \"by
an **active suppression** of \'race\' as a legitimate topic or term of
**public discourse** and **public policy**]{.underline}. \"54 Instead,
[neoliberalism\'s emphasis on **individual responsibility** renders race
as an antiquated category and racism as a problem of the
past.]{.underline} 55 Bradley Jones and Roopali Mukherjee explain that a
[neoliberal public presents a \"**socially progressive politics** by
articulating a **colorblind**, **cosmopolitan**, **post-race subject**,
while characterizing as **\'back- wards\' or \'racist\'** those who
invoke racial claims.]{.underline} \"56 If there are only individuals,
then charges of racism and sexism, which associate individuals with
broader categories and implicate agency in structure, deny individual
autonomy and serve only to \"excuse\" per- sonal failings. Jones and
Mukherjee hold that [neoliberalism depoliticizes and privatizes
difference, such that \"**culture becomes a matter of individual
choice**.]{.underline} \"57 [These moves]{.underline} replace a
dialectic of agency and structure with an exclusive focus on agency, and
they [bracket the relationship between **subjectivity**, **agency**, and
**power**]{.underline}. The neoliberal subject appears as a new
bourgeois subject. The cases of gender and race illuminate a uniform
neoliberal discounting of particularity and difference, which extends to
class, sexuality, ethnicity, and more. [[Presuming **universality**,
the]{.mark} neoliberal subject [fails to recognize **how particularity
matters**,]{.mark} [especially for]{.mark} [those whose differences
**complicate** their enactment of this]{.mark} **putative
[universal]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [This lack of
recognition]{.underline} carries considerable weight, since, as Wendy
Hesford explains, \"recognition [affords legibility to certain bodies
and social relationships and **not to others**]{.underline}. \"58
[Neoliberalism cannot see the particularity of its public subject nor
the varying advantages and disadvantages that the presumed adoption of
homo oeconomicus]{.underline} places on the diverse subjects of a
pluralistic society. [This lack of recognition propagates **resource
disparities** for people whose particularities carry **additional
responsibilities** and **burdens** that complicate the **economic
rationality** ascribed to homo oeconomicus]{.underline}. [A neoliberal
public operates by **the principle of competition** rather than the
**coordinated action** of a networked public sphere operating with **a
dynamic public good**]{.underline}. For a neolib- eral public,
[competition frames social relations as a **zero-sum game**; one
person\'s **success** and standing appear **at the expense of
another**]{.underline}. In contrast to models of the public sphere and
practices that seek wider opportunities for agency, [a neoliberal public
presents actors with **strategic advantages** in limiting the agency and
**denying the autonomy of others**]{.underline}. This constitutes a
brutal embrace of, in Mouffe\'s terms, \"the potential antagonism that
exists in human relations.\" Mouffe recognizes the value of contestation
for publicity, but she argues that productive conflict requires a move
from antagonism to agonism, which constructs an other in such a way that
it is no longer perceived as an enemy to be destroyed, but as an
\"adversary,\" that is, somebod whose ideas we combat but whose right to
defend those ideas we do 9 not put into question. While agonism brings
together conflict and reciprocity---which intimate, as Mouffe suggests,
\"some common ground\"---[antagonism and [neoliberal competition
emphasize **conflict without reciprocity**]{.mark}, which appears as a
corollary of turning social commitments inward]{.underline}. In this
vein, [denying another\'s voice or disavowing relationships with others
may remove **competitive obstacles to one\'s own success**]{.underline}.
Shifting from a laissez-faire view of market and state relations,
neoliberalism enjoins the state to take actions that bolster
competition. As Jamie Peck explains, Friedman and other neoliberal
theorists \"expressly sought to transcend the \'naive ideology\' of
laissez-faire, in favor of a \'positive\' conception of the state as the
guarantor of a competitive order.\" 60 Through privatization and trade
agreements, the state may create markets. Through the reduction or
elimination of social safety nets, the state may compel market behavior.
Through various means, notes Sanford Schram, neoliberalism
\"restructures the state to operate consistently with market logic in
order to better promote market-compliant behavior by as many people as
possible.\"61 Concordant with a rise in income inequality in the United
States, the contemporary disinvestment in and privatization of public
insti- tutions by state officials creates particular hardships for
low-income and minority com- munities, who depend more on these
institutions and may lack the resources, for example, to send children
to well-funded private schools. [Faced with few options, members of
marginalized groups confront a choice: either internalize a market model
or suffer as a \"disposable population\"]{.underline} that a
restructured state has made \"less of a burden on the rest of society.
\"62 Oftentimes, [this putative choice generates both out-
comes---**discipline and suffering**. While articulating relationships
through a **public good** to enable coordinated action may promote
equality, **inequality functions as the condition and end of
competition**]{.underline}. **[[To win, we must become unequal to
others]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Inequality is not a social problem
warranting redress for a neoliberal public, but a necessary part of its
dynamic operation. As Maurizio [Lazzarato explains, \"for the
neoliberals, the market can operate as **regulatory principle** only if
competition is made the regulatory principle of society.]{.underline}
\"63 Yet, as Lazzarato and 64 others observe, **[markets are not
natural]{.underline}**. Markets must be constructed and maintained. [The
disciplinary force of neoliberalism serves to compel people to act
according to market logics. Towards this end, inequality serves a
valuable, motivating purpose: \"Only inequality has the capacity to
sharpen appetites, instincts and minds, driving individuals to
rivalries]{.underline}.\"65 Neoliberalism draws on inequality for its
very existence.

the Evil Demon of the Simulacrum" Economy and Society Volume 30 Number

[[The power of the simulacrum]{.mark}, therefore, [may]{.mark} prove to
[be **greater than Baudrillard realized**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On a
personal level this is certainly the case. In a candid 1984--5 interview
he reveals that his courtship of its demon became an unlivable
experience: 'I stopped working on simulation. I felt I was going totally
nuts' (1993a: 105). The simulacrum, however, could not be so easily
disposed of. Despite his desire to 'cast off this yoke of simulacres and
simulation' (1993a: 184), the 'simulacrum' has thrived, becoming an idea
popularly and irrevocably identified with Baudrillard. [[It has]{.mark},
appropriately, [exerted its]{.mark} simulacral [power to appear]{.mark}
in the popular imagination as the real philosophy of Jean
Baudrillard]{.underline}, eclipsing his critique, and all other aspects
of his work and career. Journalistic commentary and student texts are
typical here in identifying the simulacrum as Baudrillard's sole
approved project. Thus the problem of finding Baudrillard's flat is
turned into an obvious and banal hook by one interviewer, who takes the
opportunity to enquire whether 'Baudrillard himself . . . might be a
simulacrum': Does he really exist? (Leith 1998: 14). More importantly
for Baudrillard, however, is the simulacral efficacy of doubling -- the
theoretical strategy of employing simulation which, quite naturally, has
a simulacral effect. The theory of simulation Baudrillard did not
believe in has now been realized: as the Japanese interviewer makes
clear, the simulacrum has become reality. Volatized in, and as, the
real, its victory is the concept's defeA2: once it is 'true', the
simulacrum becomes a commonplace, robbed of its capacity to arouse the
world's denial and thus its critical force: if there is nothing beyond
the simulacrum then it is not even open to question but is simply 'our
absolute banality, our everyday obscenity' (Zurbrugg 1997: 11). Hence
Baudrillard's emphasis upon the theoretical challenge of the simulacrum.
Once realized, unless -- as Baudrillard hopes -- it can itself be
reversed against simulation, then this critical function is lost.
[[Opposing Baudrillard]{.mark} with the simulacrum -- with its success
-- [is]{.mark}, therefore, [the most effective means of
critique]{.mark}]{.underline}. For his work is not wrong, but too true:
[[the simulacrum has become reality]{.mark} and **[this is his
end]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the game is over. It is, therefore, in the
hyperdefence of Baudrillard that we find a means of leaving him behind.
With his success, Baudrillard disappears. [[If we want him to
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we must **condemn him** as a nihilistic
proponent of the simulacrum and oppose him with an outraged]{.mark},
vituperic, [moral appeal to reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Kellner and
Norris do; thereby restoring his work to life. For, if it is only in its
contradiction that it can live as a provocation and diabolical
challenge, then once it is true this ends. Kellner and Norris,
therefore, may yet prove to be Baudrillard's greatest defenders.
Baudrillard, of all people, should have anticipated his disappearance,
for the simulacrum's demonic power rests also in its attraction for, and
hold over, humanity. Aristotle, for example, recognized this, writing of
this instinctive pleas- ure of imitation in man, 'the most imitative of
living creatures' (1997: 5), while Nietzsche also speaks of 'the delight
in simulation' and of its effects in 'explod- ing as a power that pushes
aside one's so-called "character", 􏰝 ooding it and at times
extinguishing it' (1974: para. 361). One courts this demon, therefore,
at one's own risk, as it captivates and ovearwhelms our personality. As
the author of the Psalms cautioned the makers and worshippers of idols,
'they that make them are like unto them: so is everyone who trusteth in
them' (Barasch 1992: 20). The efficacy of simulation and the danger of
disappearance are key themes in Roger Caillois' influential essay on
animal mimicry and the mimetic instinct -- no less powerful in insects
than in man (Caillois 1984). The instinct of mimesis parallels primitive
magic, Caillois says, though it is a mimetic spell which is too strong
for those who cast it. For the insects it is a spell which has 'caught
the sorcerer in his own trap' (1984: 27) -- Phylia, for example, 'browse
among them- selves, taking each other for real leaves' (1984: 25). So,
Caillois argues, simulation absorbs the simulator, leading to their
mimetic 'assimilation to the surroundings' with a consequent
'psychasthenic' loss of distinction, personality, and also, in a
thanatophilic movement, the loss of the signs of life itself (1984: 28,
30). Simulation, therefore, 􏰜 nally overwhelms the simulator: as
Caillois warns in the epigram which opens his article, 'Take care: when
you play with phantoms, you may become one' (1984: 17). So Baudrillard's
game has the same result. [If **[the simulacrum has been
realized]{.mark}**; if simulation is now our everyday banality, then
[Baudrillard is condemned to a lifeless disappearance as a sorcerer
trapped by his own magical invocation]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[absorbed
by his own simulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Baudrillard may not
believe in the ghost of the simulacrum, but he himself becomes this very
ghost. His game with phantoms ends, as Caillois knew it would, with his
own phantasmatic transformation, with his apparitional disappearance.
But this is only fitting, for in the pact with the devil it is always
your soul that is the stake.
