Global oil prices have been on a wild ride over the past year. After
peaking at a four-year high of US\$76 last October, the price of West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) tumbled more than 40% at the end of 2018 (Chart
1). Since then, prices have staged an impressive comeback, with WTI
returning back to the US\$66 level. The rally coincided with improving
risk sentiment as well as reduced recession risks and expectations of
stabilizing demand. Still, a more important influence has been on the
supply side, where cuts by OPEC+ have effectively eliminated a sizeable
production surplus in the global oil market. Indeed, total world crude
oil supply is now estimated to be around 2.5 to 3.1 million bpd below
its peak in November 1. [[With **prices**]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[running]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[in line with]{.mark}
**[fundamentals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[we expect]{.underline}]{.mark}
that WTI and other [global benchmarks are likely to trade]{.underline}
**[side-ways]{.underline}** over the next few quarters. In our view,
**[[any move]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[above]{.underline}]{.mark} the top
end of the US\$60 to US**[[\$65]{.underline}]{.mark}** range [[is
likely]{.mark} to prove **[short-lived]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such a
scenario, we would expect supply to enter the market rather quickly. The
outlook for Canadian oil benchmarks is slightly less favourable, with
the discount on the WCS benchmark expected to widen going forward (see
Box 1). This forecast reflects longstanding transportation issues, the
fading impact of the curtailment plan, and the recent drop in
crude-by-rail shipments Box 1: Update on Canadian Oil Benchmarks
Canadian oil spreads have narrowed remarkably since the Alberta
government announced a plan to curtail production last December. Since
then, prices have comfortably followed the rally in global benchmarks,
with the WTI-WCS spread stable and averaging an unusually narrow US\$10
since the start of the year. The curtailment plan is intended as a
temporary solution to a supply glut problem that sent discounts to
record levels last fall, including on lighter oil variations and
synthetic crude. Starting in February, production limits have been
gradually eased as a response by the government to improving prices and
inventory reductions at the time. Still, we doubt that this low discount
can be sustained in the near and medium term amid still-high inventories
and a recent collapse in crude-by-rail shipments. Media reports and
announcements by some producers have suggested that the recent spread
levels (around US\$10) are too low to justify the marginal cost of
crude-by-rail shipments (at around US\$15-US\$20 range). This recent
drop in energy export volumes2 and crude-by-rail shipments will likely
slow down the inventory draws in the near term, thus adding further
uncertainty (Chart 2). Indeed, the discount has widened (albeit only
slightly) in the past two weeks, now sitting closer to US\$12.5. Longer
term, demand side drivers for Canadian heavy oil remain relatively
strong, with a large proportion of U.S. refineries configured for heavy
oil as feedstock. Given that U.S. production is primarily of a lighter
variant (WTI) and that alternative heavy oil sources are lacking and/or
declining, this should maintain stable demand for Canadian heavy oil in
the foreseeable future. A lack of pipeline capacity remains a key
longer-term barrier to Canadian heavy oil prices. A recent delay to Line
3, initially relied on to start operations by the end of 2019, has added
to the uncertainty -- with the pipeline now expected to be completed in
the second half of 2020. At the same time, there has been minimal
progress on the TransMountain (TMX) and Keystone XL pipelines from a
regulatory perspective. A Federal decision on TMX is expected (albeit
not guaranteed) in June. Other factors contributing to forthcoming
uncertainty include the potential cancellation of additional rail
capacity planned by the previous Alberta government, which would erase
around 120K of planned transportation capacity, and the International
Maritime Organization regulations on sulphur caps coming into effect
next year (IMO 2020). On the whole, we believe that the current discount
on Canadian heavy oil is likely too low, and continue to expect that it
will widen again to levels near US\$15-US\$20 range by year-end. This
forecast reflects the fading impact of the Alberta curtailment plan (and
the easing in production limits), the potential impact of the recent
drop in crude-by-rail shipments and export volumes on inventories, and
the lack of progress on transportation and pipeline capacity. With
pipeline delays still on the horizon and with the production curtailment
plan winding down, crude-by-rail continues to be the marginal option for
transportation, justifying a discount in the aforementioned range. Risk
sentiment has improved since late 2018 Heading into last summer, market
participants were feeling quite optimistic about oil prices. By October,
the price for a barrel of WTI and Brent oil had risen around US\$16 and
US\$20 dollars from the outset of the year, respectively. But with the
start of autumn came an abrupt change of scenery. In a matter of 12
weeks, WTI fell from a high of US\$76 to a trough of US\$42, catching
market participants and producers by surprise. Much of this change
coincided with sudden souring in the global economic outlook and risk
appetite. [Since December,]{.underline} [[risk sentiment
has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[notably [improved]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[and was matched by a similar movement in **oil markets**]{.underline}.
For instance, net non-commercial positions in oil futures (used as a
proxy for speculative positions) [have]{.underline} **[bounced back
sharply]{.underline}**, though not reaching the peak levels posted
during last year's price run-up (Chart 3). While the timing of WTI's
drop and consequent rebound has been identical to that of other major
risk assets (including the S&P 500 Index as shown in Chart 1) the
magnitude of the swing has been relatively pronounced. Underlying the
broad tailwind to prices from the 'risk-on' behavior so far this year
has been a steady tightening in the crude supply-demand balance. In the
second half of 2018, daily world production was exceeding consumption by
as much as 2.5 million barrels per day, pushing up global inventories
sharply. The [[excess]{.underline}]{.mark} daily [[output has been
**swiftly addressed**]{.underline}]{.mark} since the start of the year.
**[Demand expectations]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} mixed, but
**[stabilizing]{.underline}** With the increased global uncertainty last
year came both a significant lowering in near-term global GDP growth and
oil consumption projections. The IMF's recent World Economic Outlook
placed world growth at 3.3% in 2019 (Chart 4). This is a further
downgrade from October (3.7%), and equates to over US\$300 billion
removed from global GDP. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that a 0.3
ppt shock to global GDP growth results in around a 200K bpd drop in
global oil demand (Chart 5). On the plus side, recent data, such as that
for global business sentiment surveys, have started to turn the corner.
A pause in rate hikes and a dovish tilt by major central banks has been
supportive for growth expectations going forward. In addition, renewed
Chinese stimulus and infrastructure spending is expected to support
improved sentiment in 2019. At the same time, worries around an
escalating China-US trade war have dissipated and so too have fears of a
looming recession. This bodes well for a firming in oil consumption
later this year. Drilling down on demand by country reveals that China,
India, and the U.S., are driving a significant chunk of the **[growth in
demand]{.underline}** in the last few years (Chart 6). For these
countries, consumer and manufacturing-related growth [is]{.underline}
still [holding]{.underline} relatively **[strong]{.underline}**. It is
demand from advanced economies (ex-U.S.) that is at risk, including
Japan, South Korea, and European countries. This coincides with IMF's
forecast, which cut growth expectations the most in advanced economies.
Putting the demand picture together, growth forecasts (y/y) are ranging
from 1.2 to 1.4 million bpd in 2019 as a whole3. [We expect]{.underline}
that [growth in 2019 will be]{.underline} at the lower end of this
range, given our relatively **[conservative]{.underline}** 3.2% global
growth forecast. [[Stabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} global GDP [[growth
should]{.underline}]{.mark} be enough to at least [[keep
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[stable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} near-term forecast [[horizon and prevent it
from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[slipping]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}** [[below this range]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Supply-side factors are doing the heavy lifting
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} more **[[prominent
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[behind oil's]{.underline}]{.mark}
fundamental [[turnaround is]{.underline}]{.mark} the supply side. [Total
world supply has fallen by more than 2.5 million bpd since its peak in
November]{.underline} -- mostly due to planned and unplanned OPEC+ cuts.
OPEC+, led by **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}**, has reduced
output even more than its 1.2 million bpd commitment at its December
meeting in Vienna. Compliance for most producers in OPEC+ has been
running well above 100%4. Saudi Arabia's output alone has dropped more
than 1 million bpd, with further drops in most OPEC+ countries.
Unplanned and involuntary drops also brought some supply off the market
due to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela (more than 400K bpd). In Canada,
the mandated government curtailment plan in Alberta, which is home to
the oilsands, has seen raw crude oil and bitumen production drop on
average of -275K bpd in Q15 (see Box 1 for a detailed analysis on this).
The return to deficit territory (Chart 7) of the daily global
supply-demand position has removed a key roadblock depressing oil
prices. Inventories have been slow to respond, given their elevated
starting point6 and the glut formed by the end of 2018. However, signs
of tightening and stabilization are starting to emerge. For instance,
OECD inventories have reduced (albeit slowly), and are are now narrowing
in on their five-year average. A recent development, whereby the U.S.
fully eliminated all waivers on sanctioned Iranian oil is expected to
further deepen the deficit in the near-term. Still,
**[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[upward impact on
prices]{.underline}]{.mark} and balances [[should **not linger for
long**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [especially with OPEC's spare capacity now
at upwards of 3 million barrels per day7 and with U.S. shale production
being relatively elastic.]{.underline} Historically, OPEC has offset
unexpected reductions in global oil supply (Chart 8). With the recent
elimination of Iranian waivers, we expect that OPEC+ will gradually
reverse some of the recent cuts over the second half of the year,
following its June meeting. On the flip side, U.S. shale production is
likely to continue to grow. Average annual production was more than 500K
bpd higher than initial estimates in 2018. The EIA forecasts production
will increase by around 1.4 million bpd in 2019 and another 0.7 million
bpd in 20208. The comparable rate posted in 2018 was 1.6 million bpd.
This would result in a significant supply build, though a lesser one
than that which occurred in 2018. This slowdown in production growth is
consistent with the number of oil rigs in operation. Here we have seen a
modest decline since the autumn 2018 price slump (Chart 9). Rig counts
remain well below their elevated pre-2014 investment surge levels. It is
important to note that the elasticity of shale output to price changes
is relatively high, and rig counts will likely be quick to respond to
any expectation of sustained price increases. Results from the quarterly
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Energy Survey suggest that the breakeven
price to profitably drill a new well sits in the US\$48-US\$54 range
(Chart 10), with an average of US\$50. Indeed, rig counts declined in
the fall of 2018 as prices dropped below that range. Of course, U.S.
shale is not the sole determinant of prices, but with relatively low
breakeven levels, it is now assumed to be a significant force in keeping
prices range-bound. This marginal cost to drill a new well in U.S. shale
provides an anchor to our price forecast. Price outlook In sum, the
crude oil market appears to be in a sweet spot with oil prices improving
closer to their longer-term fundamental level, output growing in line
with consumption, and stockpiles on track to be worked off towards
historical norms. [As such, our base case assumes that WTI prices will
trend in the US\$60-US\$65 (Chart 11) range within **the next two
years**]{.underline}. This range also implies that oil prices will
continue to trade at a premium to the marginal cost of new U.S. shale
production. Our base case relies on near-term global growth expectations
holding firm at around 3.2% and that OPEC+ maintains some of the cuts
put in place last December in the coming months in order to keep the
supply-demand fundamentals in balance. [**Upside risks** to the forecast
are mostly centered on **wildcards**]{.underline}, [namely supply
disruptions and geopolitical factors]{.underline}. This includes further
drops in Venezuelan output, disruptions in Libya and Nigeria, or a
larger than expected impact of Iranian sanctions on the crude market,
which could force the risk premium implied in the price of oil higher.
On the downside, the most notable risk is a deeper than projected
slowdown in global growth as well as a renewed wave of pessimism in
global financial markets.

[Bain warned, however]{.underline}, that [a substantial cut in
output]{.underline} like what the Kingdom imposed in the 1970s [could
lead to the price of oil escalating to \$150 per barrel]{.underline}.
While that scenario remains unlikely, "[there is **little
doubt**]{.underline} that [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [has the **ability** to
**single-handedly engineer** an]{.mark}other '**[oil
shock]{.mark}**]{.underline},'" Bain wrote. Warren Patterson,
commodities analyst at ING, told CNBC\'s Squawk Box Europe on Tuesday,
said any move to cut production by the Saudis \"would only quicken the
pace of energy transition.\" \"If this is something the Saudis were
allowed to do, they\'d be really shooting themselves in the foot,\" he
said. \"In the short to medium term we\'ll definitely see an incremental
amount of demand destruction, but the bigger issue is in the longer
term.\" [**Energy analyst** Phil **Flynn**]{.underline}
[told]{.underline} The **[A]{.underline}**ssociated
**[P]{.underline}**ress that Saudi Arabia would only hurt itself if they
caused a surge in gas prices because [[they would "**put the world into
a recession**]{.underline}]{.mark} and that would lower the demand for
oil." The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S.
benchmark crude, was trading around \$72 per barrel Tuesday afternoon.
The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, was trading around \$82.
The difference in prices between the two commodities is primarily due to
U.S. energy pipeline constraints and international geopolitical factors.
[**[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia** makes]{.underline} about [12 percent of
global petroleum and [remains]{.mark} the world's **largest
exporter**]{.underline} of the commodity. In terms of U.S. dependence on
Saudi oil, as of last month, [Saudi Arabia ranked second only to Canada
as the source of U.S. crude oil **imports**]{.underline}, with an
average of 948,000 barrels per day in gross U.S. imports, according to
the Congressional Research Service. Saudi Arabia produced 7.6 million
barrels of crude per day. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for
foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a
center-right think tank, said [Saudi Arabia has the ability to keep oil
on or off the market]{.underline}, thereby [influencing the world price
and putting the country "[at the **pinnacle of the global**]{.mark}
**energy [market]{.mark}**]{.underline}." She said **[[other
major]{.mark} oil-[producing countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as
Russia and Venezuela, [are **not in an economic position** to
**hold**]{.mark} **back** their **[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
"The bottom line is [there's **no such thing** as **energy
independence**]{.underline}," Pletka said, noting that, depending on the
price of oil, it can be cheaper for [[the **U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark}
to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries than to produce it
domestically. The tensions only increased over the weekend when
President Donald Trump [[threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[severe
punishment]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[against]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arabia and alluded to
**[[leveraging]{.underline}]{.mark}** a multi-billion dollars in
**[[arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between the two allies [as a
**punitive measure**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in an interview on CBS' "60
Minutes" that aired Sunday. For its part, the Saudi government is
attacking its critics and not backing down following condemnation from
many world leaders over its alleged role in Khashoggi's death. The U.S.
resident and Washington Post writer living in self-imposed exile,
disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. On
Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Riyadh, where he met
with Saudi officials including King Salman and his son, Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman. Over the weekend, as various media outlets reported
some evidence linking Khashoggi's disappearance and presumed death to
Saudi Arabia, [[the Kingdom]{.mark} government **[threatened to go after
any punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as economic sanctions,
outside political pressure or even "repeated false accusations." Turki
Aldakhil, general manager of the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya News
Channel, angrily wrote on the outlet's English-language website Sunday
that [**[U.S.-]{.mark}imposed [sanctions]{.mark}** on the Kingdom [would
**affect oil production**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[prices could jump]{.underline}]{.mark}
from \$80 a barrel [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as
**[[\$400]{.mark} a barrel]{.underline}**. "[[If **US sanctions** are
imposed on Saudi]{.mark} Arabia, [we will be facing an **economic
disaster** that would **rock the**]{.mark} **entire
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he wrote. "Riyadh is the capital of its
oil, and touching this would affect oil production before any other
vital commodity. It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure to commit to
producing 7.5 million barrels."

improved sentiment in 2019. At the same time, worries around an
escalating China-US trade war have dissipated and so too have fears of a
looming recession. This bodes well for a firming in oil consumption
later this year. Drilling down on demand by country reveals that China,
India, and the U.S., are driving a significant chunk of the **[growth in
demand]{.underline}** in the last few years (Chart 6). For these
countries, consumer and manufacturing-related growth [is]{.underline}
still [holding]{.underline} relatively **[strong]{.underline}**. It is
demand from advanced economies (ex-U.S.) that is at risk, including
Japan, South Korea, and European countries. This coincides with IMF's
forecast, which cut growth expectations the most in advanced economies.
Putting the demand picture together, growth forecasts (y/y) are ranging
from 1.2 to 1.4 million bpd in 2019 as a whole3. [We expect]{.underline}
that [growth in 2019 will be]{.underline} at the lower end of this
range, given our relatively **[conservative]{.underline}** 3.2% global
growth forecast. [[Stabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} global GDP [[growth
should]{.underline}]{.mark} be enough to at least [[keep
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[stable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} near-term forecast [[horizon and prevent it
from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[slipping]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}** [[below this range]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Supply-side factors are doing the heavy lifting
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} more **[[prominent
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[behind oil's]{.underline}]{.mark}
fundamental [[turnaround is]{.underline}]{.mark} the supply side. [Total
world supply has fallen by more than 2.5 million bpd since its peak in
November]{.underline} -- mostly due to planned and unplanned OPEC+ cuts.
OPEC+, led by **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}**, has reduced
output even more than its 1.2 million bpd commitment at its December
meeting in Vienna. Compliance for most producers in OPEC+ has been
running well above 100%4. Saudi Arabia's output alone has dropped more
than 1 million bpd, with further drops in most OPEC+ countries.
Unplanned and involuntary drops also brought some supply off the market
due to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela (more than 400K bpd). In Canada,
the mandated government curtailment plan in Alberta, which is home to
the oilsands, has seen raw crude oil and bitumen production drop on
average of -275K bpd in Q15 (see Box 1 for a detailed analysis on this).
The return to deficit territory (Chart 7) of the daily global
supply-demand position has removed a key roadblock depressing oil
prices. Inventories have been slow to respond, given their elevated
starting point6 and the glut formed by the end of 2018. However, signs
of tightening and stabilization are starting to emerge. For instance,
OECD inventories have reduced (albeit slowly), and are are now narrowing
in on their five-year average. A recent development, whereby the U.S.
fully eliminated all waivers on sanctioned Iranian oil is expected to
further deepen the deficit in the near-term. Still,
**[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[upward impact on
prices]{.underline}]{.mark} and balances [[should **not linger for
long**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [especially with OPEC's spare capacity now
at upwards of 3 million barrels per day7 and with U.S. shale production
being relatively elastic.]{.underline} Historically, OPEC has offset
unexpected reductions in global oil supply (Chart 8). With the recent
elimination of Iranian waivers, we expect that OPEC+ will gradually
reverse some of the recent cuts over the second half of the year,
following its June meeting. On the flip side, U.S. shale production is
likely to continue to grow. Average annual production was more than 500K
bpd higher than initial estimates in 2018. The EIA forecasts production
will increase by around 1.4 million bpd in 2019 and another 0.7 million
bpd in 20208. The comparable rate posted in 2018 was 1.6 million bpd.
This would result in a significant supply build, though a lesser one
than that which occurred in 2018. This slowdown in production growth is
consistent with the number of oil rigs in operation. Here we have seen a
modest decline since the autumn 2018 price slump (Chart 9). Rig counts
remain well below their elevated pre-2014 investment surge levels. It is
important to note that the elasticity of shale output to price changes
is relatively high, and rig counts will likely be quick to respond to
any expectation of sustained price increases. Results from the quarterly
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Energy Survey suggest that the breakeven
price to profitably drill a new well sits in the US\$48-US\$54 range
(Chart 10), with an average of US\$50. Indeed, rig counts declined in
the fall of 2018 as prices dropped below that range. Of course, U.S.
shale is not the sole determinant of prices, but with relatively low
breakeven levels, it is now assumed to be a significant force in keeping
prices range-bound. This marginal cost to drill a new well in U.S. shale
provides an anchor to our price forecast. Price outlook In sum, the
crude oil market appears to be in a sweet spot with oil prices improving
closer to their longer-term fundamental level, output growing in line
with consumption, and stockpiles on track to be worked off towards
historical norms. [As such, our base case assumes that WTI prices will
trend in the US\$60-US\$65 (Chart 11) range within **the next two
years**]{.underline}. This range also implies that oil prices will
continue to trade at a premium to the marginal cost of new U.S. shale
production. Our base case relies on near-term global growth expectations
holding firm at around 3.2% and that OPEC+ maintains some of the cuts
put in place last December in the coming months in order to keep the
supply-demand fundamentals in balance. [[**Upside risks** to the
forecast are]{.mark} mostly [centered on]{.mark}
**[wildcards]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [namely supply disruptions and
geopolitical factors]{.underline}. This includes further drops in
Venezuelan output, disruptions in Libya and Nigeria, or a larger than
expected impact of Iranian sanctions on the crude market, which could
force the risk premium implied in the price of oil higher. On the
downside, the most notable risk is a deeper than projected slowdown in
global growth as well as a renewed wave of pessimism in global financial
markets.

WASHINGTON --- [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and

[**central bargain**: the **kingdom** would **pump oil**]{.mark} and
[the **superpower** would **provide security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
interests that bind, and sometimes divide, the two range from the price
of oil and containing Iran, to counter-terrorism, the wars in Syria and
Yemen, Saudi investment in the United States and efforts to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Relations have been strained by the Oct. 2
disappearance of Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal
Khashoggi when he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey
believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied
that but, according to published reports, may be considering describing
the incident as an attempted rendition gone wrong. Below are
descriptions of the leverage each side has and the risks of exercising
it. Oil [[As the]{.mark} world\'s **[largest oil exporter]{.mark}**,
**[S]{.mark}**audi **[A]{.mark}**rabia [has]{.mark} some [ability
to]{.mark} **flood the market** to **[depress]{.mark} oil
[prices]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} to [**curb supply** and **raise
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The kingdom]{.mark} generally seeks a
**sweet spot** to maximize current oil revenues without endangering
future earnings]{.underline}, which could happen if prices rose so high
that they chilled demand or encouraged development of alternatives.
Saudi Arabia needs oil revenue to fund state expenses and its Public
Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund slated to play a leading role
in its drive to develop non-oil industries. [On Sunday, the Saudi Press

official [making a]{.mark} **veiled [threat]{.mark}** [to **respond to
pressure** by **tinkering** with **oil supplies**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
With the boom in production of U.S. shale oil, the United States is less
dependent on imported oil. However, a [Saudi decision to **shrink global
oil supplies** and **raise prices** could]{.underline} hurt U.S.
President Donald Trump by **[slow]{.underline}**ing **[economic
growth]{.underline}** and denting his 2020 re-election prospects. [[It
could]{.mark} also **[undercut]{.mark}** the [**U.S. effort** to

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[State Department]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[spelled out a campaign of \"maximum **economic**]{.mark} and
diplomatic [**pressure**\" to **drive Iran**]{.mark} [towards
**negotiating** a **\"better\"**]{.mark} deal to replace the Iran
**[nuclear deal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. State Department Director of
Policy Planning Brian Hook told reporters on Monday that Iran is not a
\"normal\" country and must meet 12 demands in order to be relieved of
US sanctions. \"Normal countries don\'t terrorize other nations,
proliferate missiles and impoverish their own people,\" Hook said.
\"[This new strategy is not about changing]{.underline} the
[regime]{.underline}, [it is about changing the behaviour of the
leadership in Iran]{.underline} to comport with what the Iranian people
really want them to do,\" he said. The State Department said new
sanctions, which it described as \"snap back\" sanctions, will begin on
August 4, targeting Iran\'s automotive sector and its trade in gold and
other key metals. A second set of sanctions will snap back on November
6. This set will target Iran\'s energy sector, focusing on
petroleum-related transactions, plus transactions with the central bank
of Iran. The move comes two months after US President Donald Trump
announced US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. International
pressure US officials called on countries to cut all imports of Iranian
oil when it re-imposes sanctions on Tehran. It called on allies in
Europe, Asia and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions with the aim
of pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement. Hook said he
planned to meet with European allies Britain, France and Germany at the
end of the week to discuss Iran. He also said he and senior Treasury
Department officials would visit Gulf states \"in the coming days.\"
Hook told reporters that the goal of the United States was to get as
many countries as possible down to zero Iranian oil imports. \"[[Our
goal is to **increase pressure**]{.mark} on the Iranian regime [by
**reducing** to **zero** its **revenue** on]{.mark} crude **[oil
sales]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Hook said. \"We are working to minimize
disruptions to the global market but [we are confident there [is
**sufficient global spare**]{.mark} oil
**[capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Hook said more than 50
international firms have already announced their intention to leave the
Iranian market, especially in the energy and financial sectors. \"We
have been clear with countries and companies around the world that we
are bringing severe economic pressure on Iran until the regime changes
its destabilizing policies,\" Hook said. [**[S]{.mark}**audi
**[A]{.mark}**rabia\'s King [Salman **promised**]{.mark} Trump at the
weekend [that he would **raise**]{.mark} oil **[production if

frequently harass and threaten US Navy ships. Under Trump, Iran has
stopped these provocations. \"The president is doing the opposite of

Numerous commentators and officials have warned that [[if
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} defies the international community and
[[develops nuclear weapons, it could **fatally undermine**]{.mark} the
**[NPT]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, as the National Intelligence
Council noted in December of 2012, [Iranian [nuclear acquisition "could
trigger an]{.mark} [**arms race** in the Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark},
undermining the nonproliferation regime]{.underline}."79 Many fear that
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, which views Iran as its principal threat and
rival for regional influence, would quickly follow Iran into the nuclear
club (perhaps by acquiring nuclear weapons from Pakistan) and that
[Turkey, Egypt and]{.underline} possibly [other Middle Eastern states
would not be far behind]{.underline}. Second, the **[failure to prevent
Iran from developing nuclear weapons could undermine international
respect for the NPT and gut the credibility of U.S. counterproliferation
efforts]{.underline}**. The United Nations (U.N.) Security Council has
passed six resolutions since 2006 demanding that Iran comply with its
NPT obligations. Three successive American administrations have also
described Iranian nuclear weapons acquisition as "unacceptable,"
pledging to do whatever it takes to stop Iran before it gets the bomb.
[If Iran]{.underline} nevertheless [succeeds in developing nuclear
weapons, other states may conclude that the NPT is toothless and that
Washington, in particular, lacks the capability and the will to enforce
member states' nonproliferation obligations]{.underline}. Finally, [a
nuclear-armed [**Tehran**]{.mark} could itself become a supplier of
proliferation materials]{.underline}. Even if Iran does not give
operational nuclear weapons to allied states [or]{.underline} non-state
actors, i[t might consider providing others with sensitive nuclear
assistance, such as centrifuge components or warhead designs. In this
way, Tehran could pass sensitive technology to Hezbollah or help
[**jumpstart** nuclear programs in]{.mark} allied countries such as
[Sudan or Venezuela]{.mark},]{.underline} much as Pakistan's AQ Khan

### 1NC -- Oil Prices DA -- Rate Hikes

#### Oil prices have stabilized at \$65 -- fundamentals prevent any large price spikes in the status quo

**TDBFG 19** (TD Bank Financial Group, citing data from the Energy
Intelligence Group and the International Energy Agency, May 2, 2019.
"**[Oil Price Outlook: Hitting the Sweet Spot]{.underline}**."
https://www.actionforex.com/contributors/fundamental-analysis/194929-oil-price-outlook-hitting-the-sweet-spot/)

Global oil prices have been on a wild ride over the past year. After
peaking at a four-year high of US\$76 last October, the price of West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) tumbled more than 40% at the end of 2018 (Chart
1). Since then, prices have staged an impressive comeback, with WTI
returning back to the US\$66 level. The rally coincided with improving
risk sentiment as well as reduced recession risks and expectations of
stabilizing demand. Still, a more important influence has been on the
supply side, where cuts by OPEC+ have effectively eliminated a sizeable
production surplus in the global oil market. Indeed, total world crude
oil supply is now estimated to be around 2.5 to 3.1 million bpd below
its peak in November 1. [[With **prices**]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[running]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[in line with]{.mark}
**[fundamentals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[we expect]{.underline}]{.mark}
that WTI and other [global benchmarks are likely to trade]{.underline}
**[side-ways]{.underline}** over the next few quarters. In our view,
**[[any move]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[above]{.underline}]{.mark} the top
end of the US\$60 to US**[[\$65]{.underline}]{.mark}** range [[is
likely]{.mark} to prove **[short-lived]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such a
scenario, we would expect supply to enter the market rather quickly. The
outlook for Canadian oil benchmarks is slightly less favourable, with
the discount on the WCS benchmark expected to widen going forward (see
Box 1). This forecast reflects longstanding transportation issues, the
fading impact of the curtailment plan, and the recent drop in
crude-by-rail shipments Box 1: Update on Canadian Oil Benchmarks
Canadian oil spreads have narrowed remarkably since the Alberta
government announced a plan to curtail production last December. Since
then, prices have comfortably followed the rally in global benchmarks,
with the WTI-WCS spread stable and averaging an unusually narrow US\$10
since the start of the year. The curtailment plan is intended as a
temporary solution to a supply glut problem that sent discounts to
record levels last fall, including on lighter oil variations and
synthetic crude. Starting in February, production limits have been
gradually eased as a response by the government to improving prices and
inventory reductions at the time. Still, we doubt that this low discount
can be sustained in the near and medium term amid still-high inventories
and a recent collapse in crude-by-rail shipments. Media reports and
announcements by some producers have suggested that the recent spread
levels (around US\$10) are too low to justify the marginal cost of
crude-by-rail shipments (at around US\$15-US\$20 range). This recent
drop in energy export volumes2 and crude-by-rail shipments will likely
slow down the inventory draws in the near term, thus adding further
uncertainty (Chart 2). Indeed, the discount has widened (albeit only
slightly) in the past two weeks, now sitting closer to US\$12.5. Longer
term, demand side drivers for Canadian heavy oil remain relatively
strong, with a large proportion of U.S. refineries configured for heavy
oil as feedstock. Given that U.S. production is primarily of a lighter
variant (WTI) and that alternative heavy oil sources are lacking and/or
declining, this should maintain stable demand for Canadian heavy oil in
the foreseeable future. A lack of pipeline capacity remains a key
longer-term barrier to Canadian heavy oil prices. A recent delay to Line
3, initially relied on to start operations by the end of 2019, has added
to the uncertainty -- with the pipeline now expected to be completed in
the second half of 2020. At the same time, there has been minimal
progress on the TransMountain (TMX) and Keystone XL pipelines from a
regulatory perspective. A Federal decision on TMX is expected (albeit
not guaranteed) in June. Other factors contributing to forthcoming
uncertainty include the potential cancellation of additional rail
capacity planned by the previous Alberta government, which would erase
around 120K of planned transportation capacity, and the International
Maritime Organization regulations on sulphur caps coming into effect
next year (IMO 2020). On the whole, we believe that the current discount
on Canadian heavy oil is likely too low, and continue to expect that it
will widen again to levels near US\$15-US\$20 range by year-end. This
forecast reflects the fading impact of the Alberta curtailment plan (and
the easing in production limits), the potential impact of the recent
drop in crude-by-rail shipments and export volumes on inventories, and
the lack of progress on transportation and pipeline capacity. With
pipeline delays still on the horizon and with the production curtailment
plan winding down, crude-by-rail continues to be the marginal option for
transportation, justifying a discount in the aforementioned range. Risk
sentiment has improved since late 2018 Heading into last summer, market
participants were feeling quite optimistic about oil prices. By October,
the price for a barrel of WTI and Brent oil had risen around US\$16 and
US\$20 dollars from the outset of the year, respectively. But with the
start of autumn came an abrupt change of scenery. In a matter of 12
weeks, WTI fell from a high of US\$76 to a trough of US\$42, catching
market participants and producers by surprise. Much of this change
coincided with sudden souring in the global economic outlook and risk
appetite. [Since December,]{.underline} [[risk sentiment
has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[notably [improved]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[and was matched by a similar movement in **oil markets**]{.underline}.
For instance, net non-commercial positions in oil futures (used as a
proxy for speculative positions) [have]{.underline} **[bounced back
sharply]{.underline}**, though not reaching the peak levels posted
during last year's price run-up (Chart 3). While the timing of WTI's
drop and consequent rebound has been identical to that of other major
risk assets (including the S&P 500 Index as shown in Chart 1) the
magnitude of the swing has been relatively pronounced. Underlying the
broad tailwind to prices from the 'risk-on' behavior so far this year
has been a steady tightening in the crude supply-demand balance. In the
second half of 2018, daily world production was exceeding consumption by
as much as 2.5 million barrels per day, pushing up global inventories
sharply. The [[excess]{.underline}]{.mark} daily [[output has been
**swiftly addressed**]{.underline}]{.mark} since the start of the year.
**[Demand expectations]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} mixed, but
**[stabilizing]{.underline}** With the increased global uncertainty last
year came both a significant lowering in near-term global GDP growth and
oil consumption projections. The IMF's recent World Economic Outlook
placed world growth at 3.3% in 2019 (Chart 4). This is a further
downgrade from October (3.7%), and equates to over US\$300 billion
removed from global GDP. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that a 0.3
ppt shock to global GDP growth results in around a 200K bpd drop in
global oil demand (Chart 5). On the plus side, recent data, such as that
for global business sentiment surveys, have started to turn the corner.
A pause in rate hikes and a dovish tilt by major central banks has been
supportive for growth expectations going forward. In addition, renewed
Chinese stimulus and infrastructure spending is expected to support
improved sentiment in 2019. At the same time, worries around an
escalating China-US trade war have dissipated and so too have fears of a
looming recession. This bodes well for a firming in oil consumption
later this year. Drilling down on demand by country reveals that China,
India, and the U.S., are driving a significant chunk of the **[growth in
demand]{.underline}** in the last few years (Chart 6). For these
countries, consumer and manufacturing-related growth [is]{.underline}
still [holding]{.underline} relatively **[strong]{.underline}**. It is
demand from advanced economies (ex-U.S.) that is at risk, including
Japan, South Korea, and European countries. This coincides with IMF's
forecast, which cut growth expectations the most in advanced economies.
Putting the demand picture together, growth forecasts (y/y) are ranging
from 1.2 to 1.4 million bpd in 2019 as a whole3. [We expect]{.underline}
that [growth in 2019 will be]{.underline} at the lower end of this
range, given our relatively **[conservative]{.underline}** 3.2% global
growth forecast. [[Stabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} global GDP [[growth
should]{.underline}]{.mark} be enough to at least [[keep
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[stable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} near-term forecast [[horizon and prevent it
from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[slipping]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}** [[below this range]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Supply-side factors are doing the heavy lifting
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} more **[[prominent
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[behind oil's]{.underline}]{.mark}
fundamental [[turnaround is]{.underline}]{.mark} the supply side. [Total
world supply has fallen by more than 2.5 million bpd since its peak in
November]{.underline} -- mostly due to planned and unplanned OPEC+ cuts.
OPEC+, led by **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}**, has reduced
output even more than its 1.2 million bpd commitment at its December
meeting in Vienna. Compliance for most producers in OPEC+ has been
running well above 100%4. Saudi Arabia's output alone has dropped more
than 1 million bpd, with further drops in most OPEC+ countries.
Unplanned and involuntary drops also brought some supply off the market
due to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela (more than 400K bpd). In Canada,
the mandated government curtailment plan in Alberta, which is home to
the oilsands, has seen raw crude oil and bitumen production drop on
average of -275K bpd in Q15 (see Box 1 for a detailed analysis on this).
The return to deficit territory (Chart 7) of the daily global
supply-demand position has removed a key roadblock depressing oil
prices. Inventories have been slow to respond, given their elevated
starting point6 and the glut formed by the end of 2018. However, signs
of tightening and stabilization are starting to emerge. For instance,
OECD inventories have reduced (albeit slowly), and are are now narrowing
in on their five-year average. A recent development, whereby the U.S.
fully eliminated all waivers on sanctioned Iranian oil is expected to
further deepen the deficit in the near-term. Still,
**[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[upward impact on
prices]{.underline}]{.mark} and balances [[should **not linger for
long**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [especially with OPEC's spare capacity now
at upwards of 3 million barrels per day7 and with U.S. shale production
being relatively elastic.]{.underline} Historically, OPEC has offset
unexpected reductions in global oil supply (Chart 8). With the recent
elimination of Iranian waivers, we expect that OPEC+ will gradually
reverse some of the recent cuts over the second half of the year,
following its June meeting. On the flip side, U.S. shale production is
likely to continue to grow. Average annual production was more than 500K
bpd higher than initial estimates in 2018. The EIA forecasts production
will increase by around 1.4 million bpd in 2019 and another 0.7 million
bpd in 20208. The comparable rate posted in 2018 was 1.6 million bpd.
This would result in a significant supply build, though a lesser one
than that which occurred in 2018. This slowdown in production growth is
consistent with the number of oil rigs in operation. Here we have seen a
modest decline since the autumn 2018 price slump (Chart 9). Rig counts
remain well below their elevated pre-2014 investment surge levels. It is
important to note that the elasticity of shale output to price changes
is relatively high, and rig counts will likely be quick to respond to
any expectation of sustained price increases. Results from the quarterly
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Energy Survey suggest that the breakeven
price to profitably drill a new well sits in the US\$48-US\$54 range
(Chart 10), with an average of US\$50. Indeed, rig counts declined in
the fall of 2018 as prices dropped below that range. Of course, U.S.
shale is not the sole determinant of prices, but with relatively low
breakeven levels, it is now assumed to be a significant force in keeping
prices range-bound. This marginal cost to drill a new well in U.S. shale
provides an anchor to our price forecast. Price outlook In sum, the
crude oil market appears to be in a sweet spot with oil prices improving
closer to their longer-term fundamental level, output growing in line
with consumption, and stockpiles on track to be worked off towards
historical norms. [As such, our base case assumes that WTI prices will
trend in the US\$60-US\$65 (Chart 11) range within **the next two
years**]{.underline}. This range also implies that oil prices will
continue to trade at a premium to the marginal cost of new U.S. shale
production. Our base case relies on near-term global growth expectations
holding firm at around 3.2% and that OPEC+ maintains some of the cuts
put in place last December in the coming months in order to keep the
supply-demand fundamentals in balance. [[**Upside risks** to the
forecast are]{.mark} mostly [centered on]{.mark}
**[wildcards]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [namely supply disruptions and
geopolitical factors]{.underline}. This includes further drops in
Venezuelan output, disruptions in Libya and Nigeria, or a larger than
expected impact of Iranian sanctions on the crude market, which could
force the risk premium implied in the price of oil higher. On the
downside, the most notable risk is a deeper than projected slowdown in
global growth as well as a renewed wave of pessimism in global financial
markets.

#### Saudi will retaliate to the plan by hiking global oil prices

[Bain warned, however]{.underline}, that [a substantial cut in
output]{.underline} like what the Kingdom imposed in the 1970s [could
lead to the price of oil escalating to \$150 per barrel]{.underline}.
[While that]{.underline} scenario [remains unlikely]{.underline},
"[there is **little doubt**]{.underline} that [Saudi Arabia has the
**ability** to **single-handedly engineer** another '**oil
shock**]{.underline},'" Bain wrote. Warren Patterson, commodities
analyst at ING, told CNBC\'s Squawk Box Europe on Tuesday, said any move
to cut production by the Saudis \"would only quicken the pace of energy
transition.\" \"If this is something the Saudis were allowed to do,
they\'d be really shooting themselves in the foot,\" he said. \"In the
short to medium term we\'ll definitely see an incremental amount of
demand destruction, but the bigger issue is in the longer term.\"
[**Energy analyst** Phil **Flynn**]{.underline} [told]{.underline} The
**[A]{.underline}**ssociated **[P]{.underline}**ress that Saudi Arabia
would only hurt itself if they caused a surge in gas prices because
[they would "**put the world into a recession**]{.underline} and that
would lower the demand for oil." The price of a barrel of West Texas
Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, was trading around \$72 per
barrel Tuesday afternoon. The price of Brent crude, the global
benchmark, was trading around \$82. The difference in prices between the
two commodities is primarily due to U.S. energy pipeline constraints and
international geopolitical factors. [**[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia**
makes]{.underline} about [12 percent of global petroleum and
[remains]{.mark} the world's **largest exporter**]{.underline} of the
commodity. In terms of U.S. dependence on Saudi oil, as of last month,
[Saudi Arabia ranked second only to Canada as the source of U.S. crude
oil **imports**]{.underline}, with an average of 948,000 barrels per day
in gross U.S. imports, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Saudi Arabia produced 7.6 million barrels of crude per day. Danielle
Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the
American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, said [Saudi
Arabia has the ability to keep oil on or off the market]{.underline},
thereby [influencing the world price and putting the country "[at the
**pinnacle of the global**]{.mark} **energy
[market]{.mark}**]{.underline}." She said **[[other major]{.mark}
oil-[producing countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as Russia and
Venezuela, [are **not in an economic position** to **hold**]{.mark}
**back** their **[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "The bottom line is
[there's **no such thing** as **energy independence**]{.underline},"
Pletka said, noting that, depending on the price of oil, it can be
cheaper for [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries than to produce it
domestically. The tensions only increased over the weekend when
President Donald Trump [[threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[severe
punishment]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[against Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark}
Arabia and alluded to [[leveraging]{.underline}]{.mark} a multi-billion
dollars in **[[arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between the two allies
[as a **punitive measure**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in an interview on CBS'
"60 Minutes" that aired Sunday. For its part, the Saudi government is
attacking its critics and not backing down following condemnation from
many world leaders over its alleged role in Khashoggi's death. The U.S.
resident and Washington Post writer living in self-imposed exile,
disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. On
Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Riyadh, where he met
with Saudi officials including King Salman and his son, Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman. Over the weekend, as various media outlets reported
some evidence linking Khashoggi's disappearance and presumed death to
Saudi Arabia, [[the Kingdom]{.mark} government **[threatened to go after
any punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as economic sanctions,
outside political pressure or even "repeated false accusations." Turki
Aldakhil, general manager of the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya News
Channel, angrily wrote on the outlet's English-language website Sunday
that [**[U.S.-]{.mark}imposed [sanctions]{.mark}** on the Kingdom [would
**affect oil production**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[prices could jump]{.underline}]{.mark}
from \$80 a barrel [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as
**[[\$400]{.mark} a barrel]{.underline}**. "[[If **US sanctions** are
imposed on Saudi]{.mark} Arabia, [we will be facing an **economic
disaster** that would **rock the**]{.mark} **entire
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he wrote. "Riyadh is the capital of its
oil, and touching this would affect oil production before any other
vital commodity. It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure to commit to
producing 7.5 million barrels."

#### That collapses the Chinese economy -- past rate hikes don't thump 

**Xiang 16**\-- Li Xiang, journalist, US rate hikes\' effect predicted
to be limited, China Daily 2016-12-16,
http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2016-12/16/content_27691738.htm

The first of what may [be [a series of interest rate hikes by]{.mark}
[the US]{.mark}]{.underline} Federal Reserve [[is expected to have
**limited**]{.mark} **[effects on China]{.mark}\'s
economy**]{.underline} if the country continues to maintain steady
growth and keeps capital outflows and property bubbles under control,
economists said on Thursday. The Fed raised its target for short-term
interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, which was only
the second increase in a decade. It also indicated it will likely embark
on a steeper path of interest rate hikes over the next year, with three
or more rate hikes possible. Earlier, they had indicated rates might go
up only once or twice in 2017. Lian Ping, chief economist at the Bank of
Communications, said that the first and foremost task for China is to
maintain steady growth of 6.5 to 7 percent next year. \"Stable growth
will boost investors\' confidence, which could slow down the capital
outflows and attract more inbound investment,\" Lian said. China should
also improve the management of cross-border capital flows by tightening
the curbs on speculative overseas investments while relaxing controls on
inbound capital from international markets. On Thursday, the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index declined slightly by 0.73 percent, as the US
rate hike had been widely factored into current stock prices.
[**[But]{.mark}** economists warned that]{.underline} **[[any unexpected
acceleration in the pace of US]{.mark} rate
[hikes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[could generate stronger]{.mark} growth
[headwinds]{.mark} for China]{.underline} [[and create]{.mark} more
[pressure on]{.mark} the]{.underline} [Chinese]{.underline}
[[currency]{.mark}, inducing more capital outflows]{.underline}. More
uncertainties also linger around whether economic policies of the
administration of president-elect Donald Trump could cause rates to rise
at an even faster pace next year. \"The Fed cannot be seen to be behind
the curve. [[If US inflation heats up]{.mark},]{.underline} then the
probability for the Fed to move [[faster]{.underline}]{.mark} than
expected [[cannot be ruled out]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Hong Hao,
the chief strategist at Bocom International. Hong said that China\'s
monetary authorities should raise interest rates in tandem with the US
rates to ease the pressure for yuan depreciation and more capital
outflows. Economists have suggested China should step up efforts to
contain asset price bubbles like those in the property sector, against
the backdrop of a stronger US dollar. The fear is that [[a weaker yuan
and cooling property market]{.mark} [would prompt investors to
rotate]{.mark} their [funds out of]{.mark} real
[estate]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[destabilizing the overall Chinese
economy]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and accelerating capital
outflows]{.underline}.

#### Chinese economic collapse sparks great power conflict 

**Carpenter 15** (Ted Galen, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a
contributing editor at The National Interest, The National Interest,
"Could China\'s Economic Troubles Spark a War?", 9/6/15,
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-chinas-economic-troubles-spark-war-13784?page=2>,
6/24/16)

Global attention has focused on the plunge in the Shanghai stock market
and mounting evidence that China's economic growth is slowing
dramatically. Moreover, the contagion appears to be spreading,
characterized by extreme volatility and alarming declines in America's
own equity markets. Those worries are compounded because there always
have been doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's official economic
statistics. Even before the current downturn, some outside experts
believed that Chinese officials padded the results, making the country's
performance appear stronger than it actually was. If China is now
teetering on the brink of recession, the political incentives for
officials to conceal the extent of the damage would be quite powerful.
The focus on the possible wider economic consequences of a severe
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[economic
slowdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} is understandable, since the
ramifications [**[could be extremely unpleasant
for]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
global economies. But we should also be vigilant about how such economic
stress might affect Beijing's diplomatic and military behavior. It is
not unprecedented for a government that feels besieged to attempt to
distract a discontented public by fomenting a foreign policy crisis. In
Henry IV, Shakespeare pithily described that process as the temptation
to "busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels." China's leaders likely feel
increasingly uncomfortable. The implicit bargain that has been in place
since the onset of market-oriented reforms in the late 1970s has been
that if the public does not challenge the Communist Party's dominant
political position, the Party will deliver an ever-rising standard of
living for the people. The bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 was
a graphic reminder of what happens if the Party's position is
challenged. However, until now, the economic portion of the bargain
seemed secure, characterized by breathtaking, often double digit, rates
of growth. It is uncertain what happens if the Party can no longer
maintain its part of the implicit bargain, but it is likely that a
dangerous degree of public discontent will surface. Beijing might
refrain from deliberately provoking a major foreign policy crisis, since
the Chinese economy depends heavily on export markets, and access to
those markets would be jeopardized by war. However, **[[the need
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** preserve and strengthen national unity and
[**[distract]{.mark}**]{.underline} the public
[**[from]{.mark}**]{.underline} mounting [**[economic troubles is likely
to impel Chinese leaders to adopt]{.mark}**]{.underline} very
[**[hardline policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} in at least three areas.
And all of those situations entail the danger of
**[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulations that **[[could lead to
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One issue is the
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
[**[S]{.underline}**]{.mark}ea. Beijing has made extraordinarily broad
territorial claims that encompass some 90 percent of that body of water.
China is pressing its claims with air and naval patrols and the building
of artificial islands. Those policies have brought Beijing into
acrimonious [disputes with]{.underline} neighbors such as
[Vietnam]{.underline} and the [Philippines,]{.underline} which have
rival territorial claims[, and]{.underline} with the world's leading
maritime power, [**the** **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, which resists any manifestation of Chinese
control over the South China Sea and the crucial commercial lanes that
pass through it. The [**conditions**]{.underline} are in place
**[for]{.underline}** a [**nasty confrontation**.]{.underline} Chinese
leaders have already stressed the country's alleged historical claims to
the area, and made it clear that it will not tolerate being subjected to
humiliation by outside powers. Such arguments are designed to gain
domestic support by reminding the Chinese people of the country's long
period of weakness and humiliation in the 1800s and early 1900s. A
second issue is Taiwan. Beijing has long argued that
[[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} is rightfully part of China and was stolen
from the country in the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Although Chinese
leaders have exhibited patience regarding the issue of reunification,
relying in large measure on growing cross-strait economic ties to entice
Taiwan to eventually accept that outcome, Beijing has also reacted very
sharply whenever Taiwanese officials have pushed an agenda of
independence, as during the administration of Chen Shui-bian from 2000
to 2008. The [danger]{.underline} of renewed confrontation
[is]{.underline} rising, since public opinion polls indicate that the
nominee of Chen's old party, the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party, will be Taiwan's next leader. A new [[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the Taiwan Strait [[would be]{.mark}]{.underline} extremely
[[serious, since the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has obligated itself]{.underline}]{.mark} to consider any Chinese
efforts at coercion as a "grave breach of the peace" of East Asia. Yet
there is little doubt that there would be widespread domestic support on
the mainland for a stern response by the Beijing government to a
Taiwanese attempt to enhance its de-facto independence. Indeed, there
might be more political danger to the regime if it did not take a strong
stance on that issue. The third possible arena for crisis is the East
China Sea. [**[China]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[**[adamant about]{.mark}**]{.underline} its claims to the
Diaoyu/[**[Senkaku]{.mark}**]{.underline} islands, which are under
Japanese control. From China's perspective, those islands were stolen by
Imperial Japan at the same time that Tokyo took possession of Taiwan
following the 1895 war. And ginning up public anger against Japan is
never difficult. China just finished celebrating the 70th anniversary of
the end of World War II, which is touted in China as "the Chinese
People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World
Anti-Fascist War." Recalling Japan's invasion of China, and the
resulting atrocities, was a prominent theme of the various commemorative
events. But the animosity is not based solely on historical grievances.
Anger at Japan over the ongoing East China Sea dispute and other matters
has already produced anti-Japanese riots in Chinese cities,
characterized by attacks on Japanese businesses and automobiles. There
is a powerful incentive for Chinese leaders to take an uncompromising
stance on the Diaoyu/Senkaku feud, confident that the Chinese people
will back such a stance. All of this suggests that the United States and
its allies need to proceed cautiously about dealing with China,
especially on these three issues. Now is not the time to press a Chinese
leadership that likely feels beleaguered by the country's economic woes.
The last thing we should do is give those leaders further temptation to
distract the Chinese people with a foreign policy confrontation. [[Such
a strategy entails]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[grave **risk of
miscalculation**]{.mark} [and **escalation**]{.mark},]{.underline} and
that would be [**a tragedy for all**]{.underline} concerned.

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- No Price Spike 

#### Oil prices will stay calm -- geopolitical events don't thump 

**Dunn 19** (Katherine Dunn, writer for Yahoo Finance, citing the IEA,
May 17, 2019. "Oil Prices Are Being Hit By The Perfect Storm---And
Laughing It Off."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-being-hit-perfect-154951426.html)

Oil markets do not have a reputation for being particularly zen.
Volatile and quick-to-react, crude oil futures have a tendency to swing
wildly and sometimes irrationally, often going in exactly the opposite
direction oil analysts expect---sometimes for years at a stretch. So
[when **crude** was hit with a "**perfect storm**]{.underline}" this
week---[from]{.underline} alleged [attacks on]{.underline} Saudi ships
in [the]{.underline} [world's **[most important]{.underline}**

war**](http://fortune.com/2019/05/13/china-tariffs-list-us/)]{.underline},
[to name but two highlights]{.underline}---[the market]{.underline}
surprised observers once again: by more or less **[shrugging it all
off]{.underline}**. Of course, oil markets have not suddenly become
relaxed. The result of so much [geopolitical **saber-rattling** and
trade uncertainty]{.underline} has instead pulled bets on oil prices in
two different directions, analysts say: one where there is sinking
demand and more than enough oil in the world, and another where global
markets are facing supply shock after supply shock. The result? **[It's
all canceling each other out]{.underline}**, [leaving
prices]{.underline} largely **[stuck in the middle]{.underline}**.
Prices for Brent crude front-month futures---the typical benchmark for
international oil prices---did strengthen over the course of this week,
but not by much. On Friday, Brent was trading around \$72.66 per barrel
by the end of the day in London, after spending the day nearly flat,
with the total weekly gain around \$2.25 per barrel or 3.2%. It's a
trend that's played out in the last month, the International Energy
Agency (IEA) said when it released its monthly oil report mid-week.
[Despite a **range of geopolitical shocks**]{.underline}, [the Brent
price]{.underline} over the course of the previous month [had **barely
budged**]{.underline}, it said---[prices are currently only about
\$1/barrel over the same time last month]{.underline}. "**[Nothing is
pulling prices in either direction]{.underline}**," Neil Atkinson, head
of the oil division at the IEA in Paris, told Fortune. "They're \[They
[are]{.underline}\] **[fairly calm]{.underline}**."

#### Oil prices will remain stable for the long-term

Brent crude **[oil prices]{.underline}** [will average]{.underline}
**[\$65]{.underline}**.15 [per barrel in 2019 and **\$62**]{.underline}
[per barrel in **2020**]{.underline} [according to the]{.underline}
**[most recent forecast]{.underline}** from the US Energy Information
Administration\'s monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook
(**[EIA]{.underline}**). This reflects an upward revision of \$2.37 per
barrel for 2019 compared to the previous estimate. The OECD Economic
Outlook as of November 2018 is more bullish, pegging the real price of a
barrel of Brent oil--- i.e. price adjusted for inflation---at
\$80/barrel in 2019. Looking out to 2020, the IMF in its Primary
Commodity Prices Projections released in July asserted that after modest
growth in 2018, the nominal price of Brent crude will increase to
\$53.5/barrel by 2020 and West Texas Intermediate to \$50.36/barrel.
[The **World Bank**]{.underline} [anticipates]{.underline} that all
three major benchmark [oil prices]{.underline}, Brent, WTI, and Dubai,
[will]{.underline} continue to increase after 2020 to
[reach]{.underline} **[\$70]{.underline}** [per barrel]{.underline} on
average [in **2030**]{.underline}. [Oil price forecasts depend on the
interaction between supply and demand for oil on international
markets]{.underline}. Among [the]{.underline} **[most
important]{.underline}** supply-side [factors weighing on
pricing]{.underline} [expectations are US shale oil production, US crude
oil stocks, and OPEC oil supply.]{.underline} On December 7, 2018, OPEC
and non-OPEC countries agreed to cut oil production by 1.2 million
barrels a day beginning in January for a six-month period. The agreement
from OPEC, in spite of increasing US crude oil inventories, has buoyed
oil prices during the start of 2019. By April, Brent crude price reached
\$71.12 per barrel, which is \$22 higher than at the end of December of
the previous year. But, [the **robust increase**]{.underline} [of US
shale]{.underline} oil activity, which is expected to continue, [is
**broadly expected**]{.underline} [to **limit price gains**]{.underline}
in the future. According to the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report, world
oil demand will increase by 1.3 million barrels per day in 2019.

#### Prices will be low in the long term -- Chinese slowdown.

[Oil prices fell more than 1%]{.underline} on Monday [after more **poor
Chinese economic figures** fanned fears of lower worldwide oil
demand.]{.underline}

Brent [crude futures lost \$1.07]{.underline} to settle at \$60.94 a
barrel, a 1.73 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate
([WTI]{.underline}) crude [futures fell 58 cents]{.underline} to settle
at \$51.93 a barrel, a 1.10 percent loss.

[Prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 high reached in April, in
part due to concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and disappointing
economic data.]{.underline}

[China's industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed]{.underline} to a
more than 17-year low, data from the National Bureau of Statistics
showed on Friday. It grew 5.0% in May from a year earlier, missing
analysts' expectations of 5.5% and well below April's 5.4%.

U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could meet
at the G20 summit in Japan later this month. Trump has said he would
meet with Xi at the summit, although China has not confirmed the
meeting.

"[All the major reporting agencies are reporting that demand is going to
be weaker]{.underline}," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures
Group in Chicago. "[That has played into the market malaise. **Things we
would normally rally off of, we're not.**"]{.underline}

Bank of America [Merrill Lynch lowered its Brent price
forecast]{.underline} to \$63 per barrel from \$68 a barrel for the
second half of 2019 [on faltering demand.]{.underline}

Worries remained about increased tensions in the Middle East following
last week's attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The United
States blamed the attacks on Iran but Tehran denied involvement.

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- Plan Collapses Alliance 

#### The alliance is [built]{.underline} on military assistance in exchange for [oil access]{.underline} -- the plan crushes the relationship

the U.S.-Saudi Relationship So Special? Weapons, Oil and \'An Army of
Lobbyists\'. October 18, 2018.
time.com/5428669/saudi-arabia-military-relationship/\]

[The]{.underline} 75-year [**alliance** between the two nations has been
built on a **simple arrangement**]{.underline}: [**American demand** for
**Saudi oil** and **Saudi demand** for **American
firepower**]{.underline}.

[It is a relationship that is **not easily unwound** as a bipartisan
group of U.S. Senators found out earlier this year when they **moved to
cut** off **military assistance** to the Saudis]{.underline} in their
war against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The United Nations has said that
more half of the more than 10,000 people who have been killed in the
three-year old war are civilians, and the lives of millions are
potentially at risk from famine.

The U.S. government has provided intelligence, munitions and midair
refueling to Saudi warplanes since operations kicked off in 2015.
Attempts by American lawmakers to stop that aid have thus far failed.

Saudi Arabia has spent at least \$5.8 million on lobbying Congress this
year, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics,
a government watchdog. But recently filed documents detailing expenses
and reimbursements put the actual number closer to \$9 million, said
Lydia Dennett, investigator with the Project on Government Oversight.

"The Kingdom has a veritable army of lobbyists and PR firms working to
promote their interests in a wide variety of ways," she said.

The Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, a left-leaning think tank
in Washington, recently compiled records filed under Foreign Agents
Registration Act that show in 2017 Saudi lobbyists contacted over 200
members of Congress, including every Senator. The data also found the
Saudi agents contacted officials in the State Department, which oversees
foreign military sales, nearly 100 times.

[The **Saudi-U.S. relationship** is **peerless** when it comes to arms
sales]{.underline}. The kingdom buys more American weapons than any
other nation. [Saudi Arabia accounted for nearly one-fifth of American
of all weapons exports over the past five years]{.underline}, according
to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.

The Pentagon has a team of U.S. service members based out of the capital
Riyadh wholly dedicated the "management and administration of Saudi
Arabian Foreign Military Sales." It serves as a direct pipeline to move
weapons from U.S. arms manufacturers into the arms of the Saudi
military.

[The U.S. military's Joint Advisory Division works alongside commanders
in each branch of the Saudi military to help fill their weapons
needs]{.underline}. Once the Saudis commit to what they want --- tanks,
attack helicopters, missiles, ships, laser-guided bombs --- the arms
packages must be OK'd by the U.S. Defense and State Departments, and
approved by Congress.

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- Plan = Oil Retaliation 

#### Saudi will retaliate to the plan by skyrocketing oil prices -- history and experts err Neg

(CNN Business) --- [Forty-five years ago]{.underline},
**[S]{.underline}**audi **[A]{.underline}**rabia and its allies [cut off
oil supplies to the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[over]{.underline} its [support for Israel]{.underline}. Oil [prices
**quadrupled**]{.underline}, [delivering a **huge shock** to the
**global economy**]{.underline}. [Now the kingdom is facing **threats of
punishment**]{.underline} over the unexplained disappearance of a
Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, [and is talking of
**retaliation if America imposes sanctions**]{.underline}. [A **leading
Saudi commentator**]{.underline} has even [hinted]{.underline} that
[**oil** could once **again be used** as a weapon]{.underline}. Writing
in a personal capacity, Turki Aldakhil, general manager of the
Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, warned on Sunday that the United
States would \"stab its own economy to death\" and [oil prices would
soar to **\$200 a barrel** if Washington **imposes sanctions** on
Riyadh]{.underline}. [Oil prices were flat on Monday]{.underline},
suggesting [**markets** have **for now dismissed the risk** that Saudi
Arabia could restrict supplies]{.underline}. Speaking in India, **[Saudi
energy minister]{.underline}** Khalid al-Falih [said]{.underline} Monday
that [the kingdom would continue to act as \"the central bank of the oil
market\" to **keep supply and demand in balance**, according to media
reports]{.underline}. But [**if the crisis** over Khashoggi
**escalates**, **that commitment could crumble**, say **oil
experts**]{.underline}. [A **rhetorical threat**]{.underline} to
withhold additional supplies \"[could]{.underline} certainly
[exert]{.underline} some **[upward pressure on prices]{.underline}**,\"
said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital
Markets. And the [kingdom could go further, by \"slow-walking\" output
increases to make up for reduced Iranian supplies]{.underline} when US
sanctions take effect next month, Croft added. Filling the gap left by
Iran Saudi Arabia pumps around 10.5 million barrels of oil a day,
according to OPEC data. It has previously said it is willing, along with
Russia, to fill the gap created by the return of sanctions on Iran. \"We
expect Iran\'s crude production to decline by nearly 1 million barrels
per day,\" said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad
Energy. \"Saudi Arabia is the only country that has spare production
capacity \... to compensate for such losses.\" World oil markets have
been transformed by a doubling in American output over the past decade.
For the first time since 1973, the United States is the world\'s largest
producer of crude oil, according to preliminary estimates published last
month. As a result, America is far less dependent on Saudi oil that it
once was. In 2017, the United States imported 9% of its oil from the
kingdom, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Imports
from Saudi Arabia have almost halved over 25 years. But [**the world**,
and the US still **needs Saudi oil**]{.underline}. While US imports of
Saudi oil have declined, [the kingdom remains the No. 2 source of
foreign oil in the United States, behind only Canada]{.underline}. Boom,
then bust? [Any move by the Saudis to cut supply would **push up global
prices**, hitting drivers in their pockets and further **forcing up
inflation** that already **threatens** to take the shine off
**America\'s economy**]{.underline}.

[The **Saudi government** is **notoriously thin-skinned** when it comes
to **international criticism**]{.underline} of its human rights record.
In 2017, for example, the Saudis threatened to pull "hundreds of
millions of dollars in assistance" to U.N. humanitarian relief and
counterterrorism programs and to "break relations with the United
Nations" if it kept Saudi Arabia on a blacklist of countries complicit
in harming children during armed conflict. [The **Saudis** **take**
their **reputation very seriously** and are **willing to resort** to
**strong-arm tactics**]{.underline} to avoid public
condemnation---although they are unwilling to redress the very abuses
that are dragging down their reputation in the first place. They are
justifiably concerned that even a rare international reprimand may open
the floodgates and lead to frequent denunciations of Saudi misconduct.
[**Political theory supports** the **Saudi** line of
**reasoning**]{.underline}. The pioneer of game theory, Thomas
[Schelling]{.underline}, for example, [described]{.underline} "tipping"
or **["threshold" moments]{.underline}** [in policy when **individuals**
are **particularly sensitive** to **decisions made by other
actors**]{.underline}. Schelling found that in most situations, a small
number of individuals are resolutely committed to a course of action,
but that the majority will sit on the fence. They will decide whether to
participate in an action based on what others decide---how many and who.
By the same token, the Saudis are apprehensive that the March statement
by the U.N. Human Rights Council may serve a permissive function,
signaling to fence-sitting countries dismayed by Saudi conduct that they
can now speak out against these violations.

## Neg Econ Scenario 

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- Saudi Hike = Econ Collapse 

#### That quickly collapses the global economy -- no checks and arm sales are key 

**Rapier 18** (Robert Rapier, chemical engineer in the energy industry,
October 24, 2018. "Saudi Arabia Proves That Oil Is Power."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/10/24/saudi-arabia-proves-that-oil-is-power/#4a2a1d0342e8)

According to the [2018 BP Statistical Review of World
Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html),
in 2017 [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} produced 12 million barrels of oil
per day. That [accounted for 12.9% of the world\'s oil
production]{.underline}, which is in the range of the world\'s two other
major oil production superpowers \-- Russia and the U.S. However, [there
is an important distinction when it comes to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
In Russia, oil production is concentrated among a dozen or so companies.
In the U.S., thousands of companies acting in their own self-interest
produce oil. But [in Saudi Arabia, all of the oil production is
controlled by Saudi Aramco]{.underline}, the state-owned oil company and
reportedly the [most profitable
company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/the-aramco-accounts-inside-the-world-s-most-profitable-company)
in the world. Given that **[Saudi Arabia\'s]{.underline}** [share of oil
production is **well beyond** the spare production capacity of the
world\'s **most important** commodity]{.underline}, [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} [has]{.underline} **[incredible economic
power]{.underline}**. [All Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [would have to do
is **withhold** three or four million barrels of oil per day from the
market]{.underline}, [and prices would]{.underline} **[quickly
rise]{.underline}** [above]{.underline} **[\$100/barrel]{.underline}**.
[Some analysts have floated the idea of oil prices getting as high as
**\$200 or even \$400/bbl** in the event of a disruption in Saudi\'s
petroleum output.]{.underline} That may seem preposterous, but keep in
mind that [during the 1973 oil embargo, oil prices **quadrupled** in
about six months]{.underline}. [Prices like that would **quickly push**
the **global economy into recession**,]{.underline} as it helped do in
1973. [That is the power Saudi Arabia holds]{.underline}. Consider the
oil price movements since 2014. Oil prices plunged because Saudi Arabia
sought to win market share back from the shale oil producers. So, OPEC
flooded the market with oil, which sent prices down by over 70%. Then,
when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports. **[No other entity]{.underline}** [in the world has
as much **power** to move the oil markets]{.underline}.
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [could]{.underline} **[quickly]{.underline}**
[bring the]{.underline} **[global economy to its knees]{.underline}**.
Thus, as the world debates a harsh punishment for Saudi Arabia over the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi earlier this month, **[they really
hold the trump card.]{.underline}** [\$100 billion in potential **arms
sales** is **small potatoes**]{.underline} [considering the]{.underline}
**[havoc]{.underline}** [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [could unleash if it
decided to use oil as an **economic weapon**]{.underline}. [This is just
one price we pay for our dependence on oil]{.underline}. **[Global
economic security will continue to depend strongly on the cooperation of
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}**

#### Saudi will retaliate to the plan -- history proves the global price of oil will skyrocket 

**Davies 18** (Rob Davies, reporter at the Guardian, citing the general
manager of the official Saudi news channel, October 15, 2018. "How much

**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** enjoys a privileged position both in
geopolitical and economic terms. It [will]{.underline} [have a

[Its vast oil reserves -- it claims to have about 260bn barrels still to
extract -- afford the most obvious advantage]{.underline}. [The
**kingdom** is the **world's largest oil exporter**]{.underline},
pumping or shipping about 7m barrels a day, and [giving Riyadh [**huge
clout in the global
economy**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-production-iran-venezuela)]{.underline}
[because it wields power to **push up prices**.]{.underline} An
editorial in Arab News by Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of the
official Saudi news channel, Al Arabiya, offers a hint of what could be
in the offing. He said **[Riyadh]{.underline}** was weighing up 30
measures designed to put pressure on the US if it were to impose
sanctions over the disappearance and presumed murder of Jamal Khashoggi
inside the country's Istanbul consulate. These would include an oil
production cut that [could drive prices]{.underline} from around \$80
(£60) a barrel [to]{.underline} **[more than \$400]{.underline}**, more
than double the [all-time high
of\$147.27](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities)
reached in 2008. [This would have]{.underline} **[profound consequences
globally]{.underline}**, not just because motorists would pay more at
the petrol pump, but [because it would force up the cost of **all
goods**]{.underline} that travel by road. **[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia
also [supports]{.underline} thousands of US jobs via its **[arms
purchases]{.underline}**. It is the [world's second-largest arms
importer after
India](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/nearly-half-of-us-arms-exports-go-to-the-middle-east)
and 61% of those imports come from the US. It [was the US's **biggest
arms customer**]{.underline} last year, signing \$17.5bn worth of deals,
[a trend that looks set to continue]{.underline} after Donald Trump
[signed a \$110bn defence agreement in
Riyadh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-donald-trump-visit)last
year. The alliance stands to benefit US employers such as Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, General Electric and ExxonMobil. Some of the firms are
reported to have expressed concern to Trump already about the impact
that a freeze in Saudi-US relations might have. Riyadh could, for
example, simply switch its purchases to other major arms exporters such
as Russia and China. Trump's trip to the Arabian peninsula last year
also yielded an agreement that the kingdom's Public Investment Fund,
which manages its vast oil wealth, would invest in US infrastructure
programmes. The PIF is to stump up \$20bn of a \$40bn pot overseen by
the global asset manager Blackstone. The fund, however, has yet to
gather any serious momentum. **[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia
[has]{.underline} **[shown in the past]{.underline}** [that it is **not
afraid** to leverage its]{.underline} unique political and [**economic
position**]{.underline} to get its own way. An investigation into
allegations of bribery [involving the British defence firm BAE Systems
in the
country](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/us-investigation-into-bae-saudi-arms-deal-watered-down-leaked-memo-suggests)
was dropped under Tony Blair's government in 2006. Blair said Riyadh had
threatened to stop cooperating on intelligence matters, putting Britain
at greater risk of a terrorist attack. Seth Frantzman, the executive
director of the US-based Middle East Center for Reporting and Analysis,
said the kingdom's importance to US strategy in the Gulf, particularly
as a bulwark against Iran, gave it great influence. "They're part of an
American-Saudi-UAE alliance, and the current US administration is tough
on Iran, so in some ways the US is more beholden to [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia) than in previous
years," he said. "They don't want to be humiliated in this exchange. The
US press says Trump will punish Saudi Arabia, and they don't want to
come out of this looking like the child being punished. "Saudi probably
feels it's on a winning streak economically and if it has to take a hit,
which it already is in terms of its image, it will be made up for by the
fact they'll find markets somewhere else."

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 also led to a recession in the United
States. Similarly, the US economy slipped into a downturn after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990 and again following the US overthrow of Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003. "[Historically, we've seen a spike in
oil prices precede or coincide with a recession]{.underline}," said Mike
Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede. Colas noted that the
last three examples occurred "late in a protracted US economic cycle"
--- much like today's environment. America's economic expansion, now

[[above]{.underline} **[\$140 a barrel]{.underline}** in summer

#### High oil prices are uniquely detrimental to the global economy now 

**Economist 19** (The Economist, April 27, 2019. "Rising oil prices
could prevent a world economic rebound."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/27/rising-oil-prices-could-prevent-a-world-economic-rebound)

Working out what pricier oil means for the world economy is more complex
than it used to be. In America gas-guzzling consumers will have to pay
more to fill up their cars. But ever since the shale revolution, there
has been an offsetting benefit to American GDP because higher prices
stimulate investment in the Permian and other shale basins. Other
producer countries are also more likely to spend any oil windfall than
they used to be, supporting global demand. And more expensive oil should
bring the benefit of lower carbon emissions (so long as it does not
prompt the discovery of vast new oil fields). Yet [right
now]{.underline}, **[pricier oil would be bad news for the global
economy]{.underline}**. [It would hit its **weaker spots**]{.underline}.
**[Europe]{.underline}**, [whose economy is in **worse
shape**]{.underline} [than America's]{.underline}, [has]{.underline}
**[no shale industry]{.underline}** [to compensate]{.underline} [for a
hit to its consumers]{.underline}. **[China]{.underline}**, [which
imports **vast quantities** of the black stuff]{.underline}, [was the
source of]{.underline} much of [the]{.underline} [recent]{.underline}
**[global growth scare]{.underline}**. [And economic crises in Turkey,
Argentina and Pakistan would be made **worse** by the higher inflation
and larger current-account deficits that a rising oil price would
bring]{.underline}. [**Higher oil prices** could also reduce central
bankers' **leeway** to see off any downturn]{.underline}. [After oil
prices rose in 2018, several central banks in emerging markets
subsequently raised rates, fearing inflation]{.underline}. In America
and Europe policymakers have this year been able to loosen the stance of
monetary policy, providing economies with a much-needed boost to growth,
because they can point to muted inflation expectations. Higher oil
prices could start to put that trend into reverse. With many labour
markets tight, central bankers are more likely to be spooked by
oil-driven inflationary pressure. A serious oil-price shock remains a
possibility at this stage rather than a probability. But **[with the
world economy still in a fragile state, it is an uncomfortable risk to
run.]{.underline}**

#### High oil prices spark global economic disaster -- history proves

https://www.cato.org/blog/must-rising-oil-prices-compel-fed-tighten-more)

As crude oil prices recently approached \$68 a barrel, a Wall Street
Journal writer concluded that "[inflation
fears](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-funds-suffering-big-outflows-as-rattled-investors-rush-to-the-exits-1524774374)
got an added jolt this week as oil prices rose to a three-year high."

Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-is-fast-approaching-70-is-the-economy-ready-for-it-1524394800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3)
writers added that "[If crude]{.underline} continues to [move
higher]{.underline}, [it could]{.underline} begin to **[stifle economic
growth]{.underline}**." They suggest that "**[higher consumer
prices]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} gasoline and other
[energy]{.underline} products [act like a **tax**]{.underline}, while
[push]{.underline}ing **[inflation higher]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [increas]{.underline}ing [pressure on the
**Fed**eral]{.underline} [Reserve]{.underline} [to **raise interest
rates more aggressively**]{.underline}." Such [anxieties about \$70 oil
are obviously overwrought.]{.underline} Crude prices were usually above
\$100 from March 2011 to September 2014, yet nobody was then fretting
about inflation fears forcing the Fed to raise the fed funds rate. But
this does raise two very important issues: First, the importance of
soaring oil prices in the recession of 2008-2009. Second, the way
[the]{.underline} **[Fed]{.underline}**eral [Reserve]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} **[overreacted]{.underline}** [to surging oil prices
by pushing up interest rates]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [and

the start of 2007 to
[\$145](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO) by mid-July 2018.
Yet U.S. reporters and economists still write as though the Great
Recession had nothing to do with a global energy shock but was instead a
"financial crisis" that began with the collapse of an investment bank
(Lehman Brothers) on September 15, 2008. This is a stubborn myth. In
reality, the inability of unemployed homeowners to pay their mortgage
bills, and the failure of investments tied to those mortgages, were
[secondary
complications](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1463492)
of [a]{.underline} **[global energy shock]{.underline}** which
[cut]{.underline} **[industrial production]{.underline}** in Canada and
Europe in 2017 before that happened in the U.S. By the end of 2008, the
contraction of real GDP "was [twice as deep in Germany and
Britain](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/it-didnt-start-here)
\[as it was in the U.S.\] and much worse in Japan and Sweden." [Because
energy is a **key part**]{.underline} [of the cost of doing
business]{.underline}, [higher energy costs made production]{.underline}
and distribution **[less profitable]{.underline}** [and
thereby]{.underline} **[shrunk the global economy's
supply]{.underline}**. Yet even as late as June 2008, as crude prices
soared above \$140, The New York Times and Washington Post were
hysterical about illusory
[inflation](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-not-panic-inflation)
-- not recession. [Did the Fed also mistake a temporary oil price spike
for a sustained rise in the overall trend of inflation? I believe it did
that in 2008 and even more obviously in prior incidents of a sudden
surge in oil prices]{.underline}. The big oil price spikes (and
recessions) between 1973 and 1980 that Hamilton mentioned were clearly
matched by huge spikes in the Fed-controlled interest rate on federal
funds. Oil prices and the fed funds rate were also rising before the
1991 and 2001 recessions. [When crude rose from **\$34 to
\$74**]{.underline} from May 2004 to June 2006, [the fed funds rate
**rose** from **1 percent to 5.25 percent**]{.underline}. Once
recessions were well underway the Fed always began to bring interest
rates back down, but always (including 2008) too slowly. On January 2,
2008, The Financial Times published [my
article](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-i-am-not-using-rword-time),
"Why I am Not Using the-R-Word This Time." Citing James Hamilton, I
wrote that "if the emphasis on oil prices in Prof Hamilton's 1983 study
is correct, **[the US economy is likely to slip into recession because
of higher energy costs alone, regardless of what the Fed
does]{.underline}**. If Mr. Bernanke's 1997 study is right, timely
reductions in the Fed funds rate should avert such a recession." Once he
became Fed chairman, unfortunately, Bernanke did not aggressively cut
the funds rate in a timely manner -- but instead tried hard to prop
rates up. As Cato's [George
Selgin](https://www.alt-m.org/2015/12/04/sterilization-fed-style/)
documented, "Between December 2007 and September 2008, the Fed sold over
\$300 billion in Treasury securities, withdrawing a like amount of
reserves from the banking system, or just enough to make up for reserves
it created through its emergency lending," One result was to keep the
fed funds rate above 2 percent until September when oil prices finally
fell. In October the Fed also began paying interest on bank reserves
(above 1 percent until mid-December) to discourage bank lending.
Although an oil price of around \$70 is only half as high as the peak in
2008, and lower than it was just a few years ago, **[we do have a lot of
experience with sudden increases in oil prices that always ended in
recession]{.underline}**. And [we have a **lot of
experience**]{.underline} [with the Fed **acting**]{.underline} [as
though they were]{.underline} **[not focused]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} "core" inflation at all (i.e., excluding
**[energy]{.underline}**) by [but were **unduly
influenced**]{.underline} [by the]{.underline} misleading and
**[ephemeral impact of oil price gyrations on headline inflation
numbers.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- Econ Collapse -\> War

#### Without the global economy, [trade expectations break down]{.underline} --- causes [nuclear war]{.underline}

**Tønnesson 15** \[Research Professor, Peace Research Institute Oslo;
Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311\]

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and negative trade expectations may generate
tensions leading to trade wars among interdependent states that in turn
**increase the risk of military conflict**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015:
1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The risk may increase if one of the
interdependent countries is governed by an inward-looking socio-economic
coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the risk of war between China and
the US should not just be analysed bilaterally but include their allies
and partners. Third party countries could drag China or the US into
confrontation; third, in this context it is of some comfort that the
three main economic powers in Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South
Korea) are all deeply integrated economically through production
networks within a global system of trade and finance (Ravenhill, 2014;
Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for war]{.underline} and
peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the basis of their
future expectations]{.underline}. International relations theory must be
supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to assess the value
attributed by national decision-makers to economic development and their
assessments of risks and opportunities. [If leaders on either side of
the Atlantic begin to seriously fear or anticipate their own nation's
decline then they may blame this on external dependence, appeal to
anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to gain respect or
credibility, adopt protectionist policies, and ultimately **refuse to be
deterred by** either **nuclear arms** or prospects of socioeconomic
calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party --- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [The
greatest risk is not that a territorial dispute leads to war under
present circumstances but that **changes in the world economy** alter
those circumstances in ways that render inter-state peace more
precarious]{.underline}. If China and the US fail to rebalance their
financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a trade war could
result, interrupting transnational production networks, provoking social
distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. [This could have
unforeseen consequences in the field of security, with nuclear
deterrence remaining the only factor to protect the world from
Armageddon, and unreliably so]{.underline}. **[Deterrence could lose its
credibility: one of the two great powers might gamble that the other
yield in a cyber-war or conventional limited war]{.underline}**, or
third party countries might engage in conflict with each other, with a
view to obliging Washington or Beijing to intervene.

#### Trump escalates economic decline 

**Homer-Dixon 17** (March 19^th^, 2017, Thomas, CIGI chair of global
systems in the Balsillie School of International Affairs, "Crisis
analysis: How much damage can Trump do? (A lot),"
<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/crisis-analysis-how-much-damage-can-trump-do-a-lot/article34341100/>)

As Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence
Committee, tweeted on March 6: "We must accept possibility that [POTUS
**does not know**]{.underline} fact from fiction, **[right from
wrong]{.underline}**. That wild claims are not strategic, but worse."
The entirely predictable chaos of the new administration's first weeks
has many liberals fantasizing that Mr. Trump will be removed from office
before his term finishes. But we've seen enough of him to know he's
unlikely to leave willingly through any legitimate and lawful political
mechanism, like impeachment. Instead, [if]{.underline} Mr. [Trump
**feels cornered**, he'll declare that his enemies are **conspiring
against him** and call his supporters]{.underline} -- many of [whom are
**heavily armed**]{.underline} -- [to **come to his aid**]{.underline}.
It's also possible that Mr. Trump will find his groove, allowing things
to settle down. Yet his performance so far suggests [his administration
will instead lurch from **crisis** to **crisis**.]{.underline} To make
some sense of these outcomes, I've charted the most likely crisis types.
[Drawing on **analysis** by a **wide range of scholars**, I've also
**estimated the probabilities**]{.underline} of each type at one, two,
and five years into a Trump administration (the latter timeline assumes
that Trump is re-elected in 2020). There are four principal types, I'd
argue: financial crisis, civil violence, authoritarianism, and war. Each
crisis type then has various possible levels of intensity. "Moderate"
authoritarianism could involve, for instance, use of federal resources
to intimidate or constrain journalists and judges; substantially
increased application of force to track, detain and deport immigrants;
and criminalization of protest. Mr. Trump, or in the case of
criminalization of protest, his acolytes at the state level are already
checking some of these boxes, so I estimate the probability of this
degree of authoritarianism in the administration's first year to be 70
per cent. "Severe" authoritarianism would involve actions like a
declaration of a state of emergency, federalization of the National
Guard, or suspension of key civil liberties. This outcome is much less
likely; even after five years, I don't think it's higher than 30 per
cent. [A]{.underline} "moderate" war [crisis]{.underline}, by my
definition, [would include **any regional conflict** between the United
States and an **intermediate**]{.underline} power like Iran,
[or]{.underline} a **[great power]{.underline}** like China, say in the
South China Sea. "Severe" war would involve use of massed military force
against a great power like Russia. The category would also include [any
conflict]{.underline}, for instance, with North Korea, that [carries a
**substantial risk** of **nuclear escalation**]{.underline}. In part,
[because of Mr. Trump's **expressed hostility** towards Iran and China,
and his tendency to see **all international relations** in **zero-sum
terms**, I estimate the]{.underline} five-year [probability of
a]{.underline} "moderate" [war crisis to be **high**]{.underline}, at 60
per cent. The four crisis types are likely to be causally linked. In
particular, [civil violence]{.underline} or war [could create conditions
that Mr. Trump might use to justify]{.underline} an authoritarian
[crackdown]{.underline}. Financial crisis could also be a consequence of
war. [The administration's decision-making incompetence increases the
risk of **financial crisis**, **civil violence**, and
**war**]{.underline}. For instance, Mr. [Trump's team of advisers
contains **little high-level economic expertise**, so his administration
could be **out of its depth** should **serious trouble develop** in
**financial systems**]{.underline} overseas, say in China or Europe.
[The **specific probabilities** that one plugs into this model are
**not**]{.underline} entirely **[speculative]{.underline}**. [Experts
can argue about the details, but they're **largely in agreement**
that]{.underline}, for instance, [the **risk of nuclear war** has
**jumped**]{.underline}, which is why The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists recently moved the minute-hand of its doomsday clock closer
to midnight.

#### 2008 caused [deep vulnerability]{.underline} -- governments are [incapable]{.underline} of fixing [another calamity now]{.underline}, which would cause [world war]{.underline}

**Allen 12/16**/18 \[Michael Allen is an American political journalist.
He is the co-founder and executive editor of Axios and former chief
political reporter for Politico. Citing Adam Tooze, a Columbia history
professor. December 16, 2018.
https://www.axios.com/2008-financial-crisis-erosion-public-trust-populism-efc1c513-45ee-4a75-992e-c1656b12e2ae.html\]

In a scathing, 706-page autopsy, [Tooze urges people to stop fretting
over the possibility of another 20**08**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
economic [crisis **never really ended**]{.underline}, he says. Instead,
[after **smoldering** for a decade, it's now the "comprehensive
political and **geopolitical crisis** of the **post-Cold War
order**.\"]{.underline}

• [Tooze]{.underline} bracingly [compares the]{.underline} causes and
[impacts of 20**08** with those of **1914**, when European leaders
**sleepwalked into World War I**]{.underline}. [There is a **striking
similarity** between]{.underline} the questions we ask about [**1914**
and 20**08**]{.underline}," Tooze writes.

• "How does a great moderation end? [How do **huge risks build up** that
are little understood and barely controllable?]{.underline} [How do
great **tectonic shifts** in the **global order** unload in **sudden
earthquakes**?\"]{.underline}

One of Tooze's answers is that big banks are to blame. His thesis is
that, when it comes to the global economy, nations matter much less than
20 or 30 intertwined financial behemoths that continue to run the show.

• In Ireland, for example, the 2008 losses of three big banks equalled
700% of the nation's GDP. Somehow, the Irish government still decided to
bail them out --- "for fear of dying \[Ireland\] would commit suicide,"
Tooze writes. This effectively bankrupted the state. The same story
played out around the world to varying degrees of severity.

Tooze warns that [**potential calamity** still **lurks just around the
corner**]{.underline}, and he worries that [current **politics won\'t
allow governments** to **do the right thing** if one arises. The U.S.,
he says, managed to stop another Great Depression but **has no long
game**]{.underline}.

#### Best statistical practices demonstrate causal relationship

**Tir 10** (Jaroslav Tir, PhD, professor of political science at
University of Colorado at Boulder, "Territorial Diversion: Diversionary
Theory of War and Territorial Conflict," The Journal of Politics, Vol.
72, No. 2, April 2010, pp. 413--425)

Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable
but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These [results
suggest that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond with
territorial diversions to direct signs of their
unpopularity]{.underline} (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) [than to
general background conditions such as economic malaise.]{.underline}
Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions
while ﬁxing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy
effort. **[Bad economic conditions seem to motivate only the most
serious, fatal territorial confrontations]{.underline}**. This implies
that [leaders]{.underline} may be [reserv]{.underline}ing the most
high-proﬁle and **[risky diversions]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} the
times when they are the most desperate, that is [when their power is
threatened both by]{.underline} signs of discontent with their rule and
by more systemic problems plaguing the country (i.e., [**an
underperforming economy**). Next, I conduct a series of follow-up
tests]{.underline} suggested by an anonymous Reviewer; results based on
the reanalysis of Model 1 are presented in the online appendix.
[Evaluating the implication that territorial diversions]{.underline} are
indeed **[more likely to result from diversionary conditions than
nonterritorial diversions]{.underline}**, I set up a multinomial logit
model that contrasts the initiation of territorial MIDs versus
nonterritorial MIDs (base outcome). The results show a positive and
statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for the government unpopularity
variable (ﬁrst column of Table 3), meaning that higher levels of
government unpopularity are more likely to produce territorial rather
than nonterritorial MIDs. [Further checks]{.underline} **[include
performing rare events logit]{.underline}** (King and Zeng 2001) [**and
population-averaged logit analyses** to verify whether the rare events
nature of the dependent variable or cross-sectional characteristics of
the data alter the ﬁndings, respectively]{.underline}. [The
ﬁndings]{.underline} [for the two independent variables]{.underline}
**[remain unchanged]{.underline}** (see Table 3, columns two and three).
Finally, protesting behavior in more populous countries could be
considered more ''normal'' and less threatening to the government,
potentially lowering the incentive to divert. Dividing the government
unpopularity variable by the log of country's population (from the
Correlates of War National Capabilities data set, Singer 1987) reveals
that the population size-standardized government unpopularity variable
remains positive and signiﬁcant; see Table 3, ﬁnal column. Concerning
the control variables, the effects of power and distance are consistent
with expectations and across the Models in Table 1. Democracy, alliance
ties, and trade coefﬁcients have mostly the expected dampening inﬂuence
on territorial conﬂict initiation; but only trade exhibits a signiﬁcant
impact and only when the dependent variable is the fatal territorial MID
(i.e., in Models 3--4). 16 These results are somewhat surprising, but
the reader is reminded that the effects of alliance are highly contested
(see Maoz 2000), while the impact of trade has not been established in
the domain of territorial conﬂict. Similarly, recent research shows that
the [democratic peace weakens considerably in the context of territorial
conﬂict]{.underline} (James, Park, and Choi 2006) [and that the
democratic peace may be epiphenomenal to territorial peace]{.underline}
(Gibler 2007). [17 Importantly, the control variable results imply that
some of the related interests]{.underline} (e.g., security, regime ties)
[may indeed be subordinated to the territorial diversion impetus.
Revisiting the link between regime type and diversion, some scholars
argue that democratic leaders have a greater
motivation]{.underline}---due to the need for popular support---[for
diversion]{.underline} (e.g., Gelpi 1997; Russett 1990; Smith 1996).
[Yet, others]{.underline} (e.g., Downs and Rocke 1994; Miller 1995;
Pickering and Kisangani 2005) [assert that authoritarian leaders need
popular support in order to appear legitimate**.**]{.underline} Because
they cannot derive legitimacy from democratic institutions and
elections, they look to diversions to help them achieve this goal.
Autocrats can also divert with greater impunity due to the lack of
institutional checks and balances. In follow-up tests available from the
online appendix, Table 4, I restrict the set of initiator countries in
Model 1 to democracies only, autocracies only, all nondemocracies, and
all nonautocracies. That [the ﬁndings hold suggests **that both
democratic and autocratic leaders value territorial
diversions.**]{.underline} Nevertheless, resolving the broader debate is
beyond the scope of this study.

#### Economic decline causes global war -- statistics and diversionary theory prove

**Royal 10** (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction -- U.S.
Department of Defense, "Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the
Problem of Economic Crises", Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal
and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)

Less intuitive is how periods of [economic decline may **increase the
likelihood of external conflict**]{.underline}. Political science
literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact
of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of
interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at
systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions
follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski
and Thompson\'s (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that
[rhythms in the global economy are associated with the **rise and fall
of a pre-eminent power and the**]{.underline} often [**bloody
transition** from one pre-eminent leader to the next]{.underline}. As
such, exogenous shocks such as [economic crises could usher in a
redistribution of relative power]{.underline} (see also Gilpin. 1981)
that leads to uncertainty about power balances, [increasing the risk of
**miscalculation**]{.underline} (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, [even a
relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive
environment for conflict]{.underline} as a rising power may seek to
challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996)
also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership
cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small
powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between
global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown.
Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland\'s (1996, 2000) theory of trade
expectations suggests that \'[future expectation of trade\' is
a]{.underline} [**significant variable** in understanding economic
conditions and security behaviour of states]{.underline}. He argues that
interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so
long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However,
[if the expectations of future trade decline]{.underline}, particularly
for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, [the likelihood
for conflict increases**,** as states will be inclined to use force to
gain access to those resources. Crises could]{.underline} potentially be
the [trigger]{.underline} for [decreased trade expectations]{.underline}
either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by
interdependent states.4 Third, [others have considered the link between
economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level.
Blomberg and Hess]{.underline} (2002) [find a strong correlation between
internal conflict and external conflict, particularly
during]{.underline} periods of [economic downturn]{.underline}. They
write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and
prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends
to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover,
the [presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which
international and external conflicts self-reinforce each
other]{.underline}. (Blomberg & Hess, 2002. p. 89) [Economic decline
has]{.underline} also [been linked with an **increase in the likelihood
of terrorism**]{.underline} (Blomberg, Hess, & Weerapana, 2004), which
has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions.
Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting
government. [**\"Diversionary theory\"** suggests]{.underline} that,
[when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline]{.underline},
sitting [governments have increased incentives to fabricate external
military conflicts to create a \'rally around the flag\']{.underline}
[effect]{.underline}. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess,
and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic
decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi
(1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that
[the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic
states]{.underline} than autocratic states, due to the fact that
democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from
office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided
evidence showing that [periods of weak economic performance in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, and thus weak Presidential
popularity, [are **statistically linked** to an increase in the use of
force]{.underline}. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively
correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of
economic crises, whereas [political science scholarship links economic
decline with external conflict]{.underline} [at systemic, dyadic and
national levels]{.underline}.5 This implied connection between
integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in
the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

recovery]{.underline} efforts [since]{.underline} the

mainly [depended on **unconventional** monetary
**policies**]{.underline}. [As fears rise of]{.underline} yet
[another]{.underline} international [financial crisis]{.underline},
[there are]{.underline} growing **[concerns]{.underline}**
[about]{.underline} the increased [possibility of **large-scale military
conflict**]{.underline}.

More worryingly, [in the **current political landscape**]{.underline},
prolonged **[economic crisis]{.underline}**, [combined with]{.underline}
rising economic [inequality]{.underline}, chauvinistic
**[ethno-populism]{.underline}** [as well as]{.underline} aggressive
**[jingoist rhetoric]{.underline}**, [including
**threats**]{.underline}, [could easily **spin out of control** and
'morph' into]{.underline} military conflict, and worse, **[world
war]{.underline}**.

Crisis responses limited

The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost 'bankrupted' governments
and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the world
economy from the brink, but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal
efforts to unconventional monetary measures, primarily 'quantitative
easing' and very low, if not negative real interest rates.

But while these [monetary interventions]{.underline} averted realization
of the worst fears at the time by turning the US economy around, they
[did little to address **underlying** economic
**weaknesses**]{.underline}, largely due to the ascendance of finance in
recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since then, despite
promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously pursued, let alone
achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the
crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize'
labour markets. This [lack of **structural reform**]{.underline} [has
meant]{.underline} that the [unprecedented **liquidity** central banks
injected into economies has **not been well allocated**]{.underline} to
stimulate resurgence of the real economy.

From bust to bubble

Instead, easy credit raised asset prices to levels even higher than
those prevailing before 2008. US house prices are now 8% more than at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its price-to-earnings
ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in 1929, when the
Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another economic
crisis --- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy has become
less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is considered
likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies, with very low
interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to revive the
economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy
responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within. Thus, [another round of economic stress is
deemed likely to foment **unrest**, **conflict**, even **war** as it is
**blamed** on the **foreign**]{.underline}.

International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the
US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great
Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from
foreign competition!

Liberalization's discontents

Rising [economic insecurity, inequalities and deprivation are expected
to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic nationalist sentiments, and
**increase**]{.underline} social **[tensions]{.underline}** and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened.

Thus, [ethno-populist inspired chauvinistic **nationalism** may
exacerbate tensions, leading to **conflicts**]{.underline} and tensions
[among countries, as in the]{.underline} **[1930s]{.underline}**.
[**Opportunistic leaders** have been **blaming** such **misfortunes** on
**outsiders**]{.underline} and may seek to reverse policies associated
with the perceived causes, such as 'globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social
tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict,
including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently
exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment
appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and
increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalization and liberalization are statistically
associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism.
Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently
strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening
economic liberalization itself, both within and among countries.

Insecurity, populism, conflict

Thomas Piketty has argued that a [**sudden increase** in income
**inequality** is often followed by a **great crisis**]{.underline}.
Although causality is difficult to prove, with wealth and income
inequality now at historical highs, this should give cause for concern.

Of course, other factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and
international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, [such developments could
**inadvertently catalyse** **future** crises and
**conflicts**]{.underline}.

Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the
emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are
leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things worse.

At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and still
growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist
policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual
allies.

Thus, protracted economic distress, economic conflicts or **[another

confrontation**]{.underline} by the protagonists, [even if
**unintended**]{.underline}. Less than a decade after the Great
Depression started, the Second World War had begun as the Axis powers
challenged the earlier entrenched colonial powers.

## Neg Rate Hikes Scenario

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- No Hikes Now 

#### Rate hikes have been indefinitely paused -- the Fed is reversing course 

**Long 19** (Heather Long, economics correspondent for the Washington
Post and works at a London investment firm, citing fed historians and
economists, June 6, 2019. "The fate of Trump's economy now hinges on the
Federal Reserve, the agency the president called 'crazy'."

Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell and other **[Fed officials]{.underline}**
[have signaled]{.underline} this week that [they may]{.underline} [have
to **cut interest rates**]{.underline} in coming months [to]{.underline}
keep the economic expansion going --- and **[counter]{.underline}** any
economic harm from [Trump's]{.underline} escalating [trade
war]{.underline}. Such a move would be highly unusual. It would come at
a time when the economy has been growing quickly, and inflation and
unemployment are low. And it could serve almost as an insurance policy
on the impact of actions taken by the president, potentially
facilitating his use of tariffs in unpredictable ways. "The Fed never
had to rescue the economy from past presidents' trade wars, or from
policies that presidents embarked upon against the wishes of advisers,"
said Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of
California at Irvine who used to be the official Fed historian. The Fed
is likely to signal its next step at its policy meeting this month, and
[markets are forecasting at least **three interest-rate
cuts**]{.underline} [by the end of the year]{.underline}. Powell said
this week at a Fed conference in Chicago that the Fed is prepared to
take "appropriate" action to keep the economy from a downturn, and
stocks surged as a result. [The Fed could cut rates as soon as this
month, or at policy meetings in July, September, October and
December]{.underline}. Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at the investment
bank Natixis, pointed out in a research note Thursday that "[the Fed has
**never disappointed** the markets' call for action]{.underline}." [The
new trajectory is a **sharp U-turn**]{.underline} [from where the Fed
**had been heading**]{.underline} and poses risks whichever way the
Fed's thinking goes. The Fed has enormous sway over the economy through
its control of a benchmark interest rate that influences virtually all
lending --- from mortgages to corporate loans. [As recently as late last
year,]{.underline} [the central bank]{.underline} **[was]{.underline}**
[on a campaign of interest-rate **increases**]{.underline}, [moves aimed
at keeping the economy from overheating and inflation from getting out
of bounds]{.underline}. **[At the beginning of the year]{.underline}**,
[the Fed put those interest-rate **increases on pause**]{.underline} [as
a result of an expected **slowdown** in the economy, partly from the
trade conflict with China.]{.underline}

[Trump doesn\'t understand economics, says former Fed

points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 trimmed
earlier falls. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers, and finance
firms tend to make bigger profits when interest rates are higher. The
dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the euro, but was higher
against the pound which was trading lower as [tensions heightened over
the UK\'s exit from the European Union next
week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47636011). [Analysis of the
so-called \"dot
plot](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20190320.pdf) -
where members of the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee indicate where
they expect interest rates to move to - also revealed that they
anticipate only one increase in 2020. Mr Powell said that there was a
positive outlook for the rest of the year, with the unemployment rate
under 4% and inflation below the central bank\'s 2% target. But he said
that \"we are also very mindful of what the risks are\", which include
slower global growth and no resolution on either Brexit or US-China
trade talks. The Fed also said that is will slow the monthly reduction
of US Treasury bonds it holds from \$30bn to \$15bn from May onwards
ending in September. During the financial crisis, the Fed spent heavily
to help kick-start the US economy. [It has been reducing its a \$4.2trn
portfolio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41320675) of US Treasury
bonds and mortgage-backed securities since 2017. The Fed is getting just
a little more wary about economic prospects. For sure, these
developments are nothing like as dramatic as a cut in interest rates
would have been. Nobody expected that and we didn\'t get one. But the
hint that we should no longer think in terms of any rise at all this
year and only one in 2020 is consistent with the picture of a softening
economic outlook. There is also a striking contrast between the growth
that Feds policymakers think the US can sustain - about 2% - and what
President Trump\'s administration believes is achievable, which is more
like 3%. That difference matters. If at some stage in the future the Fed
thinks the economy is overheating it will raise rates. President Trump
has criticised the Fed for rate rises it has already made, and he won\'t
like it any more if they resume.

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- High Oil Price -\> Rate Hikes

#### Oil price spikes force aggressive acceleration of rate hikes 

**Hooper 18** (Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at
Invesco with 21 years of industry investment experience, citing 2017 Fed
commentary, May 21, 2018. "What do higher oil prices mean for the stock
market?"
https://www.blog.invesco.us.com/what-do-higher-oil-prices-mean-for-stock-market)

However, my view is that [higher oil prices]{.underline} may [have
a]{.underline} far **[great]{.underline}**er indirect
**[impact]{.underline}** [on the]{.underline} **[stock market --- and
the economy]{.underline}** --- and that this would likely happen in
several different ways. One way is [by **forcing** the]{.underline} [US
Federal Reserve (**Fed**]{.underline}) [to get **more aggressive in its
rate hike cycle**]{.underline}. It's widely known that the Fed focuses
on core inflation --- which excludes food and energy prices --- rather
than headline inflation in determining the pace of tightening, so many
assume that higher oil prices won't have an impact on the type of
inflation that the Fed cares about. However, **[higher oil
prices]{.underline}** [can and do]{.underline} [pass]{.underline}
through [into **core inflation**]{.underline}, as was noted in a 2017
Fed commentary.4 The authors concluded that "[**oil price** fluctuations
have a]{.underline} limited but **[long lasting effect]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} [core]{.underline} [inflation]{.underline}." Therefore,
[as higher oil prices seep into core inflation]{.underline} ---
exacerbated by other inflationary forces such as wage growth and tariffs
on items such as aluminum and steel --- [they]{.underline} have the
potential to [cause the Fed to get **more aggressive in its rate
hikes**]{.underline}. [This would]{.underline} be expected to
[create]{.underline} some **[headwinds]{.underline}** [for
the]{.underline} [economy]{.underline}, [which in turn]{.underline}
could [exert]{.underline} **[downward pressure]{.underline}** [on the
stock market and dampen stock prices]{.underline}. Admittedly, this
would likely occur with a significant lag and, given that its effect is
usually limited, I believe it should not be a significant concern in the
near term --- but it is not something we should entirely ignore.

#### Oil prices drive inflation and empirically the fed spikes rate

**Reynolds 18** (Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the Cato Institute and
was formerly director of economic research at the Hudson Institute,
served as research director with the National Commission on Tax Reform
and Economic Growth, an adviser to the National Commission on the Cost
of Higher Education, and a member of the Office of Management and Budget
transition team in 1981, April 27, 2018. "Must Rising Oil Prices Compel
the Fed to Tighten More?"
https://www.cato.org/blog/must-rising-oil-prices-compel-fed-tighten-more)

As crude oil prices recently approached \$68 a barrel, a Wall Street
Journal writer concluded that "[inflation
fears](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-funds-suffering-big-outflows-as-rattled-investors-rush-to-the-exits-1524774374)
got an added jolt this week as oil prices rose to a three-year high."
Two other [Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-is-fast-approaching-70-is-the-economy-ready-for-it-1524394800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3)
writers added that "If crude continues to move higher, it could begin to
stifle economic growth." They suggest that "**[higher consumer
prices]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} gasoline and other
[energy]{.underline} products act like a tax, while
[push]{.underline}ing **[inflation higher]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [increas]{.underline}ing [pressure on the
**Fed**eral]{.underline} [Reserve]{.underline} [to **raise interest
rates more aggressively**]{.underline}." Such [anxieties about \$70 oil
are obviously overwrought.]{.underline} Crude prices were usually above
\$100 from March 2011 to September 2014, yet nobody was then fretting
about inflation fears forcing the Fed to raise the fed funds rate. But
this does raise two very important issues: First, the importance of
soaring oil prices in the recession of 2008-2009. Second, the way
[the]{.underline} **[Fed]{.underline}**eral [Reserve]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} **[overreacted]{.underline}** [to surging oil prices
by pushing up interest rates]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [and
during oil-shock recessions and (in 2008) leaning against their fall
after the recession was well under way]{.underline}. In May 2009,
economist [James
Hamilton](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a6fca8ca-4c4f-4006-bca5-67e972dc19e2/hamilton-testimony.pdf)
of U.C. San Diego testified before the Joint Economic Committee. He
noted that, "Big increases in the price of oil that were associated with
events such as the 1973-74 embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the Iranian Revolution in 1978, the Iran-Iraq War
in 1980, and the First Persian Gulf War in 1990 were each followed by
global economic recessions. The price of oil doubled between June 2007
and June 2008, a bigger price increase than in any of those four earlier
episodes." Like every postwar recession except 1960, the "Great
Recession" of 2008-09 was preceded by a spike in the price of crude oil.
West Texas crude soared from \$54 at the start of 2007 to
[\$145](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO) by mid-July 2018.
Yet U.S. reporters and economists still write as though the Great
Recession had nothing to do with a global energy shock but was instead a
"financial crisis" that began with the collapse of an investment bank
(Lehman Brothers) on September 15, 2008. This is a stubborn myth. In
reality, the inability of unemployed homeowners to pay their mortgage
bills, and the failure of investments tied to those mortgages, were
[secondary
complications](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1463492)
of a global energy shock which cut industrial production in Canada and
Europe in 2017 before that happened in the U.S. By the end of 2008, the
contraction of real GDP "was [twice as deep in Germany and
Britain](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/it-didnt-start-here)
\[as it was in the U.S.\] and much worse in Japan and Sweden." Because
energy is a key part of the cost of doing business, higher energy costs
made production and distribution less profitable and thereby shrunk the
global economy's supply. Yet even as late as June 2008, as crude prices
soared above \$140, The New York Times and Washington Post were
hysterical about illusory
[inflation](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-not-panic-inflation)
-- not recession. [Did the Fed also mistake a temporary oil price spike
for a sustained rise in the overall trend of inflation? I believe it did
that in 2008 and even more obviously in prior incidents of a sudden
surge in oil prices]{.underline}. The big oil price spikes (and
recessions) between 1973 and 1980 that Hamilton mentioned were clearly
matched by huge spikes in the Fed-controlled interest rate on federal
funds. Oil prices and the fed funds rate were also rising before the
1991 and 2001 recessions. [When crude rose from **\$34 to
\$74**]{.underline} from May 2004 to June 2006, [the fed funds rate
**rose** from **1 percent to 5.25 percent**]{.underline}. Once
recessions were well underway the Fed always began to bring interest
rates back down, but always (including 2008) too slowly. On January 2,
2008, The Financial Times published [my
article](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-i-am-not-using-rword-time),
"Why I am Not Using the-R-Word This Time." Citing James Hamilton, I
wrote that "if the emphasis on oil prices in Prof Hamilton's 1983 study
is correct, the US economy is likely to slip into recession because of
higher energy costs alone, regardless of what the Fed does. If Mr.
Bernanke's 1997 study is right, timely reductions in the Fed funds rate
should avert such a recession." Once he became Fed chairman,
unfortunately, Bernanke did not aggressively cut the funds rate in a
timely manner -- but instead tried hard to prop rates up. As Cato's
[George
Selgin](https://www.alt-m.org/2015/12/04/sterilization-fed-style/)
documented, "Between December 2007 and September 2008, the Fed sold over
\$300 billion in Treasury securities, withdrawing a like amount of
reserves from the banking system, or just enough to make up for reserves
it created through its emergency lending," One result was to keep the
fed funds rate above 2 percent until September when oil prices finally
fell. In October the Fed also began paying interest on bank reserves
(above 1 percent until mid-December) to discourage bank lending.
Although an oil price of around \$70 is only half as high as the peak in
2008, and lower than it was just a few years ago, we do have a lot of
experience with sudden increases in oil prices that always ended in
recession. And [we have a **lot of experience**]{.underline} [with the
Fed **acting**]{.underline} [as though they were]{.underline} **[not
focused]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} "core" inflation at all (i.e.,
excluding **[energy]{.underline}**) by [but were **unduly
influenced**]{.underline} [by the]{.underline} misleading and
**[ephemeral impact of oil price gyrations on headline inflation
numbers.]{.underline}**

from economists at the Fed Board in

The threat fades if a country is more globally integrated, the study
found. "A 1% tightening in U.S. monetary policy increases the default
probability by about 1% to 7% for a given level of exposure to the
U.S.," authors Bora Durdu, Alex Martin and Ilknur Zer write in a Fed
staff working paper posted on the bank's website on Wednesday. That will
sound about right to the rest of the world, which was rocked by the
taper tantrum in 2013 when the Fed unexpectedly discussed plans to begin
slowing its emergency-era bond purchases. The prospect of less Fed
stimulus triggered a sell off in riskier assets, including
emerging-market bonds. Some investors may also have memories of the
international debt crisis following Fed tightening in the early 1980s
under then-Chairman Paul Volcker, and the Mexican peso crisis that was
preceded by Alan Greenspan's rate hikes in 1994. [The
**Fed**]{.underline} itself [is]{.underline} acutely [aware of
**spillovers**]{.underline} [to the rest of the world from its policy

is]{.underline} also **[wary of straying from the domestic
goals]{.underline}** [set by]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}** [to
focus on price stability and full employment]{.underline}. Warning Signs
The study provides a way to spot vulnerabilities to future banking
crises in other countries by looking at how exposed they are to the U.S.
Nations that do a large percentage of their trade with America have a
higher exposure, for example. [The authors examine data on 69 nations
between 1870 and 2010 and identify 239 banking crise]{.underline}s. Such
events occur in advanced economies roughly every 37 years. Italy has the
highest annual crisis probability among developed countries, at 6.4%,
with Brazil topping the list among emerging economies at 7.8%, based on
data on past episodes. "When U.S. monetary policy tightens, [foreign
countries could experience **capital outflows**]{.underline}, leading to
an adjustment in external accounts and domestic vulnerabilities," the
authors wrote. "[If this correction is]{.underline} **[sudden, and
sizable]{.underline}**, [it might lead to a **sudden
stop**]{.underline}. Indeed, the countries that have direct exposure to
the U.S. appear to be more prone sudden stops."

One downside to [Xi\'s]{.underline} breathtaking [success in
consolidating power]{.underline} is that it [has left him with near
total responsibility for]{.underline} his [government]{.underline}\'s
[policy missteps on matters]{.underline} ranging [from]{.underline} the
stock [market slowdown to]{.underline} [labor market
unrest.]{.underline} His visibility on these issues and [his dominance
of the decision-making]{.underline} process [have made]{.underline} him
a powerful but [potentially exposed]{.underline} leader. [With Xi\'s
image]{.underline} and political position [vulnerable to China\'s
economic downturn]{.underline}, [his **country\'s external behavior may
increasingly be guided by his**]{.underline} own **[domestic political
imperatives.]{.underline}** [For the last three years,]{.underline}
[with China\'s economy still producing]{.underline} robust [growth
numbers]{.underline}, [such concerns have not fundamentally influenced
Xi\'s foreign policy]{.underline}. Xi has been able to be continuously
proactive, and he has used his power to take China\'s foreign policy in
a new direction. He has boldly departed from Deng\'s injunction to keep
a low profile and has reclaimed islands, created international
institutions, pressured neighbors, and deployed military assets to
disputed regions. [Xi\'s foreign policy has been]{.underline} assertive,
confident, and, importantly, [a]{.underline} diversified [mix
of]{.underline} both [hard and soft elements.]{.underline} Even as China
has taken firm steps on territorial issues, it has used geoeconomic
instruments to offer generous loans and investments, and even created
new organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB).1 By combining inducements with intimidation, Xi has demonstrated
the benefits of cooperating with China as well as the economic and
military costs of opposing it, especially on issues important to
Beijing. Today, China\'s thirty-year era of 10 percent annual growth
appears to have ended, with official statistics placing gross domestic
product (GDP) growth below 7 percent, the government reducing its growth
target to 6.5 percent, and a number of major banks and respected
forecasters arguing the true growth rate is far lower---and will remain
below 5 percent for years.3 In light of this deepening economic
slowdown, [the future trajectory of Xi\'s external policy is in
question.]{.underline} Some elements, including China\'s geoeconomic
policies, will endure; nevertheless, China\'s foreign policy may well be
driven increasingly by the risk of domestic political instability. For
this reason, Xi will most probably stimulate and intensify Chinese
nationalism---long a pillar of the state\'s legitimacy---to compensate
for the political harm of a slower economy, to distract the public, to
halt rivals who might use nationalist criticisms against him, and to
burnish his own image. Chinese nationalism has long been tied to foreign
affairs, especially memories of foreign domination and territorial loss.
For example, [Xi may be less able or willing to compromise]{.underline}
in public, [especially on territorial issues]{.underline} or other
matters that are rooted in national sentiment, [for fear that it would
harm his political position. He may provoke disputes with
neighbors]{.underline}, use increasingly strident rhetoric in defense of
China\'s national interests, [and take a tougher line]{.underline} in
relations [with the United States]{.underline} [and its
allies]{.underline} **[to shift public focus away from economic
troubles.]{.underline}** He may also turn to greater economic
protectionism. These changes come at a time when Xi\'s tight control of
the decisionmaking process has made it harder for U.S. policymakers to
anticipate China\'s next moves. Familiar [interlocutors at the State
Council and Foreign Ministry]{.underline}, [who once provided
much-needed insight]{.underline} into an often mysterious policymaking
process, [are no longer central]{.underline} within it. As the shroud of
secrecy surrounding Chinese decision-making thickens, [what remains
clear is that dealing with China will]{.underline} require a more
nuanced understanding of the man with singular control over the
country\'s foreign policy future. It will also [necessitate]{.underline}
an [appreciation of the interaction between his **internal political
requirements**]{.underline} [and his foreign policy agenda]{.underline}.
Finally, it will demand a clear-eyed acceptance of the fact that Xi has
ushered in a new era of Chinese regional and global diplomacy, one that
will push the West to evaluate its overall approach to the People\'s
Republic of China (PRC) and to the powerful but exposed leader who makes
its foreign policy.

democracy --- that is, elections --- have used this device to ensure
their survival during periods of domestic upheaval or financial crisis.
Would the Chinese Communist Party ([CCP]{.underline}), whose
[**legitimacy** is so contingent on **social stability**]{.underline}
and economic growth, go down the same path if it felt that its hold on
power were threatened by domestic instability?¶ Building on the premise
that the many contradictions that are inherent to the extraordinarily
complex Chinese experiment, and rampant corruption that undermines
stability, will eventually catch up with the CCP, we can legitimately
ask how, and where, [Beijing could **manufacture external crises** with
opponents]{.underline} against whom nationalist fervor, a major
characteristic of contemporary China, can be channeled. In past decades,
[the CCP has on several occasions tapped into public outrage to distract
a disgruntled population]{.underline}, often [by
encouraging]{.underline} (and when necessary containing) [protests
against external opponents, namely **Japan**]{.underline} and the United
States.¶ While serving as a convenient outlet, domestic protests, even
when they turned violent (e.g., attacks on Japanese manufacturers), were
about as far as the CCP would allow. This self-imposed restraint, which
was prevalent during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, was a function both of
China's focus on building its economy (contingent on stable relations
with its neighbors) and perceived military weakness. Since then, [China
has established itself as the world's second-largest economy and now
deploys]{.underline}, thanks to more than a decade of double-digit
defense budget growth, [a]{.underline} [first-rate modern
military.]{.underline}¶ [Those impressive achievements have, however,
fueled Chinese nationalism]{.underline}, which has increasingly
approached the dangerous zone of hubris. For many, China is now a
rightful regional hegemon demanding respect, which if denied can --- and
should --- be met with threats, if not the application of force. While
it might be tempting to attribute China's recent assertiveness in the
South and East China Seas to the emergence of Xi Jinping, Xi alone
cannot make all the decisions; nationalism is a component that cannot be
dissociated from this new phase in Chinese expressions of its power. As
then-Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi is said to have told his
counterparts at a tense regional forum in Hanoi in 2010, "There is one
basic difference among us. China is a big state and you are smaller
countries."¶ This newfound assertiveness within its backyard thus makes
it more feasible that, [in times of serious trouble at home, the Chinese
leadership could seek to deflect potentially destabilizing anger by
exploiting some external distraction.]{.underline} Doing so is always a
calculated risk, and sometimes the gambit fails, as Slobodan Milosevic
learned the hard way when he tapped into the furies of nationalism to
appease mounting public discontent with his bungled economic policies.
For an external distraction to achieve its objective (that is, taking
attention away from domestic issues by redirecting anger at an outside
actor), it must not result in failure or military defeat. In other
words, except for the most extreme circumstances, such as the imminent
collapse of a regime, [the decision to externalize a domestic crisis is
a rational one: adventurism must be certain to achieve success, which in
turn will translate into **political gains** for the embattled
regime.]{.underline} Risk-taking is therefore proportional to the
seriousness of the destabilizing forces within. Rule No. 1 for External
Distractions: [The **greater** the domestic instability, the **more
risks** a regime will be willing to take]{.underline}, given that the
scope and, above all, the symbolism of the victory in an external
scenario must also be greater.¶ With this in mind, we can then ask which
external distraction scenarios would Beijing be the most likely to turn
to should domestic disturbances compel it to do so. That is not to say
that anything like this will happen anytime soon. It is nevertheless not
unreasonable to imagine such a possibility. [The intensifying crackdown
on critics of the CCP, the detention of lawyers, journalists and
activists, unrest in Xinjiang, random acts of terrorism, accrued
censorship --- all point to growing instability]{.underline}. What
follows is a very succinct (and by no means exhaustive) list of
disputes, in descending order of likelihood, which Beijing could use for
external distraction.¶ 1. South China Sea¶ The South China Sea, an area
where China is embroiled in several territorial disputes with smaller
claimants, is ripe for exploitation as an external distraction.
Nationalist sentiment, along with the sense that the entire body of
water is part of China's indivisible territory and therefore a "core
interest," are sufficient enough to foster a will to fight should some
"incident," timed to counter unrest back home, force China to react.
Barring a U.S. intervention, which for the time being seems unlikely,
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has both the numerical and
qualitative advantage against any would be opponent or combination
thereof. The Philippines and Vietnam, two countries which have
skirmished with China in recent years, are the likeliest candidates for
external distractions, as the costs of a brief conflict would be low and
the likelihood of military success fairly high. For a quick popularity
boost and low-risk distraction, these opponents would best serve
Beijing's interests. ¶ 2. Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh¶
[Although Beijing claims that it is ready for a settlement of its
longstanding territorial disputes with India]{.underline}, the areas
[remain ripe for the **re-ignition of conflict**.]{.underline} [New
Delhi accuses China of occupying 38,000 square kilometers in Jammu and
Kashmir, and Beijing lays claim to more than 90,000 square kilometers of
territory inside the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh]{.underline}. A
few factors militate against the suitability of those territories for an
external distraction, chief among them the difficult access in winter,
and [the strength of the Indian military]{.underline}, which [would pose
a greater risk to PLA troops]{.underline} than those of Vietnam or the
Philippines in the previous scenario. Nevertheless, memories of China's
routing of the Indian military in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 could
embolden Beijing. Though challenging, the PLA would be expected to
prevail in a limited conflict with Indian forces, and [China would have
taken on a **greater regional power**]{.underline} than Vietnam or the
Philippines, [with everything that this entails in terms of **political
benefits**]{.underline} back home.¶ 3. East China Sea and Japan¶
[Sparking a war with Japan]{.underline}, presumably [over
the]{.underline} disputed [Senkaku]{.underline}/[Diaoyu islets, would
represent a **major escalation** on Beijing's part]{.underline}.
Assuming that rational actors are in control in Beijing, a decision to
begin hostilities with the modern and skilled Japan Self-Defense Forces
would only be made if domestic instability were serious enough. Still,
[high resentment of the Japanese stemming from Japanese aggression
before and during World War II and the competitive]{.underline} nature
of the [bilateral relationship make Japan the **perfect candidate** for
an external distraction]{.underline}. More than any other conflict,
[hostilities with Japan would rally ordinary Chinese to the flag and tap
into hatred that the leadership knows it could exploit if
necessary]{.underline}. Although the chances of prevailing would be much
smaller than in the South China Sea or Indian scenarios (especially if
the U.S. became involved), the [dividends of victory against
Japan]{.underline} --- anything from teaching Tokyo a lesson to
redressing historical injustices --- [could be such as to become a
**major factor** in **appeasing major domestic unrest** in
China.]{.underline} Unless the CCP were on the brink of collapse, it is
unlikely that the leadership in Beijing would escalate tensions with
Japan beyond the disputed islets. In other words, military action
probably would not extend to other parts of Japan's territory, unless,
of course, the conflict widened. Containing the conflict by limiting it
to the Senkaku/Diaoyus would therefore be part of Beijing's strategy.

#### Indo-China conflict goes nuclear

"China's Perceptions of India as a Nuclear Weapons Power," June 30, 2016
<http://carnegieendowment.org/2016/06/30/china-s-perceptions-of-india-as-nuclear-weapons-power-pub-63970>)

China still does not regard India as a legal nuclear-weapons state. At
the same time, [China **does not regard India as a security
threat.**]{.underline} [China has identified a major gap in military
technology between India and itself]{.underline}; and because of this
gap, [China does not believe that India has the capability to threaten
it]{.underline}. Further, China's assessment of India's thresholds for
fighting a war suggests that India also has no intention to threaten
China. For reasons of both reciprocity and its own security, China does
not think it needs to respond to India's nuclear program either
militarily or diplomatically. [However]{.underline}, [in examining
India's conceivable future capabilities]{.underline} and intentions,
[many uncertainties emerge, and the possibility arises that India might
pose **major security challenges** to China]{.underline}. India's future
intentions are hard to identify accurately, but recent evidence suggests
that its old starting point of Nehruvian pacifism is defunct. Even
India's capability needs to be reexamined in light of its new strategic
interactions with the United States and U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific
region. China's perception of the threat posed by India in the medium
term depends on three factors, which all have uncertain trajectories:
foreign support for India's great power aspiration, the enhancement of
India's conventional military capability, and the character of China's
interactions with India with regard to border disputes and Tibet.
According to Daniel Markey, "Multiple China-India disputes sparked at
nearly the same time is a realistic, if unlikely, scenario during the
next twelve to eighteen months. . . . Specific warning indicators of
worsening land-border tensions would include . . . unilateral revision
of the 'rules of the road' for tactical military operations . . . and
new military construction projects or deployments along the border,
whether of troops or hardwar Of course, low-intensity armed
confrontations are totally different from full-scale war. But [an
**escalation of tensions** between India and China]{.underline}
triggered by border disputes [is **plausible**]{.underline}, especially
in conjunction with escalation between India and Pakistan. A recent
paper by Toby Dalton and George Perkovich suggests that "China is
unlikely to intervene with its own nuclear forces, especially if India
had not initiated the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict....
Beijing's stakes in a potential Indo-Pakistani nuclear conflict will
grow significantly."33 This also explains why [China is **seriously
concerned** about the possibility of India **reneging** on its
no-first-use pledge.]{.underline} As long as [**nuclear weapons** are an
option,]{.underline} the prospect of a [conflict remaining "limited"
**can never be guaranteed**]{.underline}.

[**there is enough spare** global oil **capacity** to make up for lower
supply from Iran]{.underline}, a senior U.S. State Department policy
adviser said on Monday.

Brian Hook, the State Department's director of policy planning, told a
news conference that the U.S. goal was to get as many countries as
possible down to zero Iranian oil imports.

The United States would work with allies on a case-by-case basis but
Washington did not plan to offer exemptions from sanctions, Hook added.

"[Our goal is to **increase pressure** on the **Iranian regime** by
reducing to zero its revenue on crude oil sales]{.underline}," Hook
said. "We are working to minimize disruptions to the global market but
we are confident there is sufficient global spare oil capacity."

[**Saudi Arabia's** King **Salman** promised]{.underline} U.S. President
Donald Trump at the weekend that [he would **raise** oil **production if
needed** and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity
to boost output]{.underline}, the White House said.

In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said [the **extra Saudi oil** would **help

**U**nited **S**tates pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}
in May [and moved to reimpose]{.underline} oil [sanctions]{.underline}.

Trump was not specific on whether the additional 2 million barrels was a
per-day figure - but worldwide daily demand is nearing 100 million bpd.

The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of
Iranian oil from November when the United States re-imposes sanctions
against Tehran, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed
between Iran and six major powers, against the advice of allies in
Europe and elsewhere.

U.S. officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East
to adhere to the sanctions once they are re-imposed, with the aim of
pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement.

Hook said he planned to meet with European allies Britain, France and
Germany at the end of the week to discuss Iran. He also said he and
senior Treasury Department would visit Gulf states "in the coming days."

Some 50 international companies had announced their intention to leave
the Iranian market, particularly in energy and financial sectors, as the
United States moved to reimpose the sanctions against Iran, Hook said.

"We have been clear with countries and companies around the world that
[we are bringing **severe** economic **pressure** on Iran until the

"[Trump must]{.underline} and will definitely [suffer an embarrassing
failure by not being able to bring down Iran's oil exports to
zero]{.underline}," said a senior energy businessman close to the
regime. "We will achieve this even if \[we have\] to barter crude for
Russian weapons or store our crude in Malaysia and Thailand."

[Iran]{.underline}, which derives a large part of its foreign currencies
and state revenues from oil exports, [is seeking **creative ways** to
**sell**]{.underline} its **[oil]{.underline}** ahead of the
reimposition of US sanctions on November 4. At stake are Iran's hopes of
maintaining some leverage in negotiations with the Trump administration.
Insiders believe any talks with Washington could only happen once Iran
has shown it can withstand the new sanctions and, as a result, not have
its hands tied at the negotiating table.

[Plans under consideration to circumvent the sanctions include an
initiative to revive "**middlemen**" who would be allowed to buy barrels
of crude through a domestic energy exchange, or "bourse", and sell them
in world markets under the guise of Iran's "private
sector"]{.underline}. Established in 2012, the bourse has not traded oil
since at least 2015, when Iran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions in
exchange for the lifting of crippling international sanctions.

[The measure is a sign of **how desperate** the regime is to
**maintain** **even the smallest** amount of **oil
exports**]{.underline}. Babak Zanjani, a local businessman, is facing a
death sentence for refusing to pay back \$2.8bn worth of crude he sold
to Asian buyers and never paid back the state under the previous
sanctions era.

### 2NC Saudi Oil DA -- Iran Prolif -\> War 

#### Iran prolif de-Stabilizes the Region Waltz is wrong- a nuclear Iran would destabilize the region- laundry list of reasons

**Kahl 12** (COLIN H. KAHL, associate Professor at Georgetown
University, September 2012. \"Iran and the Bomb: Would a Nuclear Iran
Make the Middle East More Secure?\" One Step Too Far\", Foreign Affairs,
Vol. 91, No. 5)

Kenneth [**Waltz**]{.underline} is probably right that a nuclear-armed
Iran could be deterred from deliberately using nuclear weapons or
transferring a nuclear device to terrorists (\"Why Iran Should Get the
Bomb,\" July/ August 2012). But he [is **dead wrong** that the Islamic
Republic would likely become a **more responsible international actor**
if it crossed the nuclear threshold]{.underline}. In making that
argument, [Waltz **mischaracterizes** Iranian motivations and **badly
misreads history.**]{.underline} And despite the fact that Waltz is one
of the world s most respected inter- national relations theorists, [he
ignores important political science research into the effects of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, including recent findings that suggest that new
nuclear states are often more reckless and aggressive at lower levels of
conflict. RATIONAL BUT DANGEROUS [Waltz correctly notes that Iran\'s
leaders, despite their fanatical rhetoric, are fundamentally
rational]{.underline}. Because Iran\'s leadership is not suicidal, it is
highly unlikely that a nuclear-armed Iran would deliberately use a
nuclear device or transfer one to terrorists. [Yet **even though** the
Islamic Republic is rational, it is **still dangerous**, and it is
likely to become **even more so** if it develops **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. [Iran\'s government currently sponsors terrorist
groups and supports militants throughout the Middle East]{.underline},
in part to demonstrate a capability to retaliate against the United
States, Israel, and other states should they attack Iran or undermine
its interests. [If the Iranian leadership\'s sole concern was its own
survival and it believed that a nuclear deterrent alone could give it
enough protection, then as a nuclear state, it might curtail its support
for proxies]{.underline} in order to avoid needless disputes with other
nuclear powers. But [Iran is not a status quo state, and its support for
terrorists and militants is intended to be for more than just defense
and retaliation. Such support is an offensive tool]{.underline},
[designed to pressure and intimidate other states, indirectly expand
Iran\'s influ- ence, and advance its revisionist agenda]{.underline},
which seeks to make Iran the preeminent power in the Middle East,
champion resistance to Israel and \"arrogant powers\" in the West,
promote its brand of revolu- tionary Islamist ideology, and assert its
leadership in the wider Islamic world. [Tehran currently calibrates its
support for militants and sponsorship of terrorism to minimize the risks
of a direct confron- tation]{.underline} with more powerful states. But
if Iranian leaders perceived that a nuclear arsenal provided a
substantially more robust deterrent against retaliation, they would
likely pursue their regional goals more aggressively [Specifically, a
nuclear-armed Tehran would likely **provide Hezbollah and Palestinian
militants** with more sophisti- cated, longer-range, and more accurate
conventional **weaponry** for use against Israel]{.underline}. In an
effort to bolster the deterrent capabilities of such allies, [Iran might
con- sider giving them \"dual-capable\" weapons, leaving Israel to guess
whether these systems were conventional or armed with chemical,
biological, or nuclear material]{.underline}. [A nuclear-armed Iran
might also give its proxies permission to use advanced weapons
systems]{.underline} instead of keeping them in reserve, as Tehran
reportedly instructed Hezbollah to do during the militant group\'s 2006
war with Israel. [A **nuclear-armed Iran**]{.underline}, [believing that
it possessed a powerful deterrent and could thus commit violence abroad
with near impunity, might also increase the **frequency and scale** of
the terrorist attacks]{.underline} against U.S. and Israeli targets
carried out by Hezbollah and the Quds Force, the covert operations wing
of Iran\'s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [And a bolder Iran
might increase the number of Revolutionary Guard forces it deployed to
Lebanon, allow its navy to engage in more frequent shows of force in the
Mediterranean, and assert itself more aggressively in the Persian Gulf
and the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}. To further enhance its image in
the eyes of domestic and regional audiences as the leader of an
anti-Western resistance bloc, a nuclear-armed Iran might respond to
regional crises by threatening to use all the means at its disposal to
ensure the survival of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah, or
Palestinian groups. And [**Iran** might be **emboldened** to play the
spoiler in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by encouraging
**large-scale militant attacks** and might try to **destabilize its
neighbors** through more coercive diplomacy]{.underline} and subversion
in Iraq and the Gulf states.

#### Iranian nuclear weapons would encourage adventurism- increases the risk of escalation- Waltz has deterrence wrong

**Kahl 12** (COLIN H. KAHL, associate Professor at Georgetown
University, September 2012. \"Iran and the Bomb: Would a Nuclear Iran
Make the Middle East More Secure?\" One Step Too Far\", Foreign Affairs,
Vol. 91, No. 5)

[If deterrence operates the way Waltz expects it to, a nuclear-armed
Iran might reduce the risk of a major conventional war]{.underline}
among Middle Eastern states. [But **history suggests** that Tehran\'s
development of nuclear weapons would **encourage Iranian adventurism**,
leading to **more frequent and intense crises** in the Middle East. Such
crises would entail some inherent risk of a **nuclear exchange**
resulting from a **miscalculation, an accident, or an unauthorized
use**]{.underline} - a risk that currently does not exist at all. [The
threat would be particularly high in the initial period after Iran
joined the nuclear club]{.underline}. Once the superpowers reached rough
nuclear parity during the Cold War, for example, the number of direct
crises decreased, and the associated risks of nuclear escalation abated.
But [during the early years of the Cold War, the superpowers were
involved in several crises]{.underline}, and on at least one occasion -
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis - [they came perilously close to nuclear
war]{.underline}. Similarly, [a stable deterrent relationship between
Iran,]{.underline} on the one hand, [and the United States and
Israel]{.underline}, on the other, [would likely emerge over time, but
the initial crisis-prone years would be **hair-raising**]{.underline}.
[Although all sides would have a profound interest in not allowing
events to spiral out of control, the residual risk of **inadvertent
escalation** stemming from **decades of distrust and hostility**, the
**absence of direct lines of communication**, and **organizational
mistakes** would be nontrivial]{.underline} - [and the consequences of
even a low-probability outcome could be **devastating**]{.underline}.

#### Arguments about deterrence and rationality miss the boat. A nuclear Iran results in aggressive terrorism and WMD access.

**Etzioni 10** (Amitai -- professor of international relations at George
Washington University, Can a Nuclear-Armed Iran Be Deterred, Military
Review, p. 123)

[Even if Iran never drops its nukes]{.underline} on anybody, [once it
demonstrates that it has acquired them]{.underline}--- say, by testing
them---[these weapons would have **considerable consequences** for our
**security**]{.underline} and that of our allies. [Desch]{.underline}
correctly [reports, "The concern is that once Iran develops a nuclear
capability, it would become even **more aggressive** in
supporting]{.underline} terrorist groups like [Hezbollah in Lebanon or
Hamas in Gaza]{.underline} . . . Finally, [many Americans fear that once
Iran ﬁelds a nuclear weapon, it will become ever more **meddlesome in
Iraq**." The side effects of allowing Iran to obtain nukes are well
spelled out by]{.underline} Emanuele [Ottolenghi, the executive director
of the Transatlantic Institute]{.underline} in Brussels. I hence quote
him at some length. He writes-- The fact is that an Iranian bomb would
enable Tehran to fulﬁll the goals of the revolution without using it. [A
nuclear bomb is a **force multiplier**]{.underline} that, as U.S.
President Barack Obama aptly said, constitutes a 'game changer.' [Iran's
success will change the Middle East forever]{.underline}---and for the
worse. [Under an Iranian nuclear umbrella, terrorists will be able to
act with impunity, and its neighbors will enter into a dangerous arms
race]{.underline}. Less understood are the dynamics that will emerge if
Iran chooses not to use the bomb against its enemies. [It matters little
that Tehran may act **rationally**. If Iran goes nuclear, the Western
world will have to negotiate a Middle East Yalta with Tehran---one that
may **entail a U.S. withdrawal**]{.underline}, an unpleasant bargain for
the smaller principalities of the Gulf's shores and an unacceptable one
for Israel and Lebanon's Christians. Last but not least is the risk that
[Iran]{.underline}, or some other rogue nation, [will **slip a nuke** or
two to terrorists, or they will obtain one **without consent of the
leaders** with the help of]{.underline} one group or another, such as
[the Revolutionary Guard. The champions of deterrence argue that it
sufﬁces to deter such nations from sharing nukes]{.underline} with
terrorists [for us to declare that if terrorists use such weapons, we
will hold responsible]{.underline} the nation that provided them.
However, [this argument assumes a **much more reliable level** of
nuclear forensics than we command]{.underline} so far. [We may well be
unable to determine the source of a bomb]{.underline}, or it will take
months, after which striking a nation with nuclear bombs in cold blood
may well not seem a very credible counterthreat. One hardly needs to
elaborate any further that even if Iran can be deterred from employing
its nukes directly, there are strong reasons to favor an Iran without
nukes.

exchange**]{.underline}---a catastrophic humanitarian event that would
threaten the entirety of Gulf oil exports for an extended period of
time. In early 2008, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee concluded:
"[If Iran obtains a nuclear weapon, it will place **tremendous
pressure** on Saudi Arabia to follow suit]{.underline}."19 By 2012, some
experts believe it has already begun to do so. Two main factors could
drive Saudi Arabia to pursue a nuclear weapon: (1) a decades-long
Saudi-Iran cold war waged along sectarian, religious, ethnic, and
geopolitical lines and (2) a deep-seated competition over the energy
policies that form the lifeblood of both regimes. The Sunni Saudi
monarchy and Shiite Iranian theocracy each claim leadership of the
Islamic world. This sectarian competition for primacy is reinforced by
ethnic differences: Saudi Arabia is the largest and most populous Arab
country astride the Gulf, but it is dwarfed by Iran's much larger
Persian-majority population. These competing claims have pitted the two
countries in an enduring cold war and proxy conflict spanning from
Lebanon to Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula. Iran---under both the Shah
and the ayatollahs---has routinely sought to use its conventional
military capabilities, large population, geostrategic position,
expansive resources, and ties to armed groups to shift the balance of
power in the Persian Gulf in its favor and at the expense of its Sunni
Arab neighbors.20 [As a result, Saudi Arabia has made it clear it views
a nuclear-capable Iran as an existential threat]{.underline}. In 2008,
King Abdullah urged the United States to "cut off the head of the
snake," one instance of his "frequent exhortations \[to\] the United
States to attack Iran to put an end to its nuclear weapons program,"
according to U.S. diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks.21 With
uncertain prospects for a halt to Iran's nuclear program---peaceful or
otherwise---in 2009, the King informed a senior American official, "If
\[Iran\] gets nuclear weapons, we will get nuclear weapons." This year,
senior Saudi officials reiterated that "it would be completely
unacceptable to have Iran with a nuclear capability and not the kingdom
\[of Saudi Arabia\]."22 [Rather than lose time developing an indigenous
nuclear program, it is likely the Saudi kingdom would seek to obtain a
nuclear warhead from Pakistan]{.underline} ready to mount on its CSS-2
ballistic missiles. [Close Saudi-Pakistani security ties date back to
shared Cold War--era interests, and it is widely believed that Riyadh
bankrolled Islamabad's nuclear weapons program with the stipulation that
Pakistan would sell nuclear devices to Saudi Arabia in an
emergency]{.underline}; in the words of a senior Saudi official,
"**[within weeks]{.underline}**."23 Pakistan would benefit by receiving
much-needed cash and could demand in return dual-key authority over
missile launches, both to control Saudi policy and to bolster its own
secondstrike capability against India. At best, [this would create a
**nuclear-armed standoff**]{.underline} between the two most powerful
and mutually antagonistic countries in the Persian Gulf. At worst, [it
could **devolve into atomic warfare**. Iran's and Saudi Arabia's **small
arsenals**, **lack of durable communication channels**, **poor civilian
oversight** of command-and-control systems, **erratic intelligence**,
**proximity** to each other, **religious ardor**, and **sectarian
divide** would all **distinguish** this scenario from the Cold War
balance]{.underline} between the United States and the Soviet Union.
[Any such conflict would likely be **extremely
devastating**]{.underline}. Each country would have natural incentives
to cripple its opponent's oil facilities in any nuclear conflict.
Crudeoil exports are both regimes' political and economic lifeblood, and
thus the basis for their military power. Also, each country's oil
infrastructure and export terminals are concentrated along the Gulf,
within range of the other's nuclear-weapons delivery vehicles. Moreover,
[a nuclear war]{.underline} in this region [would likely not only
destroy a large portion of the Gulf's oil infrastructure
but]{.underline} also [render the entire Gulf
**unavailable**]{.underline} to shipping for some period of time. [This
could come directly through radioactive fallout, atmospheric pollution,
and environmental destruction]{.underline}, or indirectly through
prohibitively high insurance rates [and other risk factors]{.underline}
for tankers transiting the region.24 Therefore, even if a nuclear
exchange did not spread into a region-wide war, the transit of
Hormuz-bound oil exports would be halted by such a conflict.

[A nuclear Iran would]{.underline} immediately [encounter]{.underline}
another nuclear state---even if an undeclared one---in the region:
[Israel]{.underline}. Compared with the relative stability of the Cold
War, [an initial stalemate between Israel and Iran would be highly
precarious at best and would]{.underline} also **[threaten the entirety
of Gulf exports]{.underline}**, although for a more limited duration.
[Were Iran to become nuclear, the frequency of crises and proxy
conflicts between Iran and Israel would **likely increase**, as would
the probability of such confrontations **spiraling into a nuclear
exchange**]{.underline}, with horrendous humanitarian consequences.
[There could be an Israeli-Iranian nuclear exchange through
**miscalculation**]{.underline} and/or miscommunication. [There
could]{.underline} also [be a calculated nuclear exchange, as the
Israeli and Iranian sides would **each have incentives to strike the
other first**]{.underline}. Tehran would likely have the ability to
produce only a small handful of weapons, whereas Israel is already
estimated to possess more than 100 devices, including 24thermonuclear
warheads far beyond the destructive power of any Iranian fission weapon.
Under such circumstances, [Iran's vulnerability to a bolt-from-the-blue
Israeli nuclear strike would actually **increase its incentive** to
launch its own nuclear attack, lest its arsenal be obliterated. Israel's
small]{.underline} territorial [size reduces the survivability of its
second-strike capability]{.underline} and, more importantly, the
survivability of the country itself, despite its vastly larger and more
advanced arsenal. [Thus, Israeli leaders might feel the need to act
**preventatively to eliminate the Iranian arsenal**]{.underline} before
it can be used against them, just as American military planners
contemplated taking out the fledgling Soviet arsenal early in the Cold
War, except that as a much smaller country Israel has far less room for
maneuver.26

## Neg AT: Renewables Turn 

### 2NC Renewables Turn -- Renewables Inevitable 

#### Renewables and global decarbonization are inevitable -- they are outcompeting fossil fuels now 

**IEEFA 19** (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, May
30, 2019. "IEEFA update: The global energy transformation is well
underway."
http://ieefa.org/ieefa-update-the-global-energy-transformation-is-well-underway/)

(SYDNEY) -- [The global energy sector transformation is a
technology‑driven disruption fueled by five compounding
factors]{.underline}. These include technological innovation driving the
economics of renewables below grid parity, global capital markets
increasingly fleeing thermal coal, and key countries and leading
corporates repositioning their climate and energy policies. Then there
is China, seeking to lead the next industrial revolution. [The
**economics of renewables** are **working**]{.underline} The global
energy transformation is being driven by the combination of
[accelerating]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nology [**innovation** and
**economies of scale**]{.underline}. This [has led the cost
of]{.underline} electricity generated by [wind]{.underline} farms [to
drop by **50% this decade**]{.underline}, [while solar costs have
declined]{.underline} by well over **[80%]{.underline}**. Offshore wind
is set to follow a similar deflationary cost trajectory. Lithium ion
batteries have likewise dropped in cost by over 50% in the last three
years, [putting]{.underline} **[electric vehicles]{.underline}** [on a
path to]{.underline} **[displace]{.underline}** internal [combustion
engines]{.underline} **[this coming decade]{.underline}**. Solar costs
are also dropping in the four largest electricity markets in the world.
While solar costs have diminished 50% in the last four years in Japan,
they are still well above grid parity. In contrast, both the U.S. and
India saw renewable energy go below grid parity with thermal power in
2017. At the same time, **[China]{.underline}** [is on target to achieve
grid parity by **2020**]{.underline}. With continuing solar cost
deflation of some 10% annually, **[these trends will
continue]{.underline}**. [Alternative energies are creating a wave of
**stranded fossil fuel assets**]{.underline}. As a leading market for
renewables, India is now grappling with some US\$60bn of thermal power
projects in financial distress, **[unable to compete]{.underline}**
[with low-cost renewables]{.underline} and hence repay loans. **[Global
capital is fleeing coal]{.underline}** IEEFA has tracked the number of
globally significant financial institutions that have introduced polices
to restrict lending, insurance and investing in thermal coal mines and
coal-fired power plants. Most recently in May 2019, Japan's Mizuho
Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group both announced coal
lending restrictions. This built on similar announcements in April 2019
by Singapore's three leading banks: Development Bank of Singapore (DBS),
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) and United Overseas Bank
(UOB). To date, [113 globally significant financial institutions are
exiting coal.]{.underline} [Of the top forty global banks, 45% now have
coal lending prohibitions]{.underline}. There is a new announcement
occurring on average every week to date in 2019. This capital flight
from the coal sector is resulting in developments like Adani's proposed
Carmichael thermal coal mine in Queensland being unable to find external
finance. Government policies are reinforcing the trend away from coal In
2015, **[India]{.underline}** [set a target to build 175 gigawatts (GW)
of renewables by 2022.]{.underline} Three years later, the ambition was
lifted to 500GW by 2030. Global capital is endorsing this new low-cost
solution. India is not alone. South Korea recently set a target to build
58GW of renewables by 2030, while Taiwan set a target of 27GW by 2025.
Earlier in 2019, Thailand introduced a new energy plan to 2037, and
coal's market share target was halved to just 12%. That Thailand is also
jumping onto the renewables bandwagon is not what the coal industry was
expecting. Increasingly, the low cost of renewables is making more
ambitious targets a sensible economic proposition. Leading corporates
are pivoting away from coal In May 2019, BHP announced it would no
longer invest in thermal coal. [The technology landscape had moved
on]{.underline}, [and the **need to decarbonise**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [achieve]{.underline} the **[Paris]{.underline}**
Agreement means BHP [sees]{.underline} thermal [coal as]{.underline}
**[increasingly obsolete]{.underline}**. RIO Tinto completed its global
exit from coal in 2018, having taken advantage of buyer interest to exit
without significant losses since 2014. Australia's leading industrial
conglomerate announced acquisition plans in both lithium and rare earths
in May 2019, both key inputs into low carbon emission industries. It is
no coincidence that Wesfarmers also completed its exit from coal mining
in 2018. And the Commonwealth Bank recently announced it was the first
Australian signatory to RE100, a global corporate leadership initiative
bringing together businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.
**[China plans to dominate this new Industrial Revolution]{.underline}**
China installed 45-50% of all solar globally in both 2017 and 2018. It
accounted for half of all electric vehicle sales globally in 2018 and is
the world's largest miner and processor of lithium and rare earths.
[China is on a clear path towards decarbonisation and is a world leader
in zero emission technologies of the future]{.underline}. In May 2019,
China's National Development and Reform Commission announced a tender
for 21GW of renewable energy, an investment program of US\$25bn. This is
the largest renewable energy investment in global history, and there is
no subsidy support. With this, China will reach its target of grid
parity for both wind and solar by 2020. Where to next? IEEFA views
[the]{.underline} **[combination]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}**, **[economics]{.underline}**,
**[finance]{.underline}**, [**energy security** and]{.underline} the
global need to deliver on the **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement as
[underpin]{.underline}ning a progressive
**[decarbonisation]{.underline}** [of global energy
markets]{.underline}. Reduced air pollution and deflationary renewables
are two added benefits that make this trend assured. [It is time
for]{.underline} Australia to prepare for [the]{.underline}
**[inevitable]{.underline}** technology-driven [energy
disruption]{.underline} that is [occurring]{.underline}
**[everywhere]{.underline}** else.

### 2NC Renewables Turn -- Low Prices Good 

#### Low oil prices are good for climate change -- they spur innovation in renewables and make oil reserves uneconomical 

**Naim 15** (Moises Naim, distinguished fellow in the International
Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
March 31, 2015. "The Hidden Effects of Cheap Oil."
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/the-hidden-consequences-of-low-oil-prices/389156/)

**[Lower oil prices]{.underline}** could also **[reduce
incentives]{.underline}** [to produce]{.underline} the kind of
extra-heavy, **[extra-polluting oil]{.underline}** that is [found
at]{.underline} some of [the world's **largest oil
reserves**]{.underline}, including those in Venezuela's Orinoco river
region. [Due to the high production and upgrading costs associated with
heavy oil, the development of these reserves is likely to be
postponed]{.underline}. The problem is that low oil prices are eroding
the economic viability of cleaner energy sources like solar and wind.
Optimists hope that [**plummeting** oil-and-gas prices will **encourage
producers of renewable-energy**]{.underline} sources [to improve their
technologies]{.underline} [and production methods]{.underline},
[making]{.underline} [these sources **cheaper and more economically
viable**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [could
make]{.underline} [renewable energy **more commercially
attractive**]{.underline} [once the price of oil rebounds]{.underline}.
Financial markets, too, are being reshaped by the cost of crude. Falling
prices can harm the balance sheets of energy companies by driving down
the volume of proven reserves that these corporations can count as
marketable assets---reserves, mind you, that are one of the main drivers
of the market value of these companies. [As oil prices
**drop**]{.underline}, [the increasing production costs of some oil
reservoirs will make these reserves commercially unviable]{.underline}.
Such reservoirs will [become a]{.underline} new kind of "**[stranded
asset]{.underline}**," a term coined to describe [fossil fuels
that]{.underline} **[will not be used]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
**[climate-change concerns]{.underline}** lead governments to
**[stimulate]{.underline}** [alternative-energy sources]{.underline} and
make the consumption of hydrocarbons more expensive. Upheaval in
corporate valuations could lead to a wave of mergers and acquisitions
among energy companies, **[transforming the structure of the
industry]{.underline}**.

### 2NC Renewables Turn -- No Impact Warming 

#### No impact to warming AND it's irreversible -- the math is impossible 

**IBD 18 (Investor's Business Daily Editorial board, citing data from
the UN's October IPCC report, the US DOE, and reports on current
emission levels, October 8, 2018. "Stopping \'Catastrophic\' Global
Warming Is Impossible, UN Report Shows, So What\'s The Point?"
https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/global-warming-un-report/)**

Climate Change: Assume for the sake of argument that everything
environmentalists say about **[global warming]{.underline}** is true. If
that\'s the case, then [there is **no chance of stopping it.** That\'s
what the latest **UN report on global warming clearly
demonstrates**.]{.underline} The headlines in stories reporting on the
UN\'s latest climate change report all say something along the lines of:
\"Urgent changed is needed to prevent global catastrophe.\" [If global
temperatures climb more than 1.5 degrees Celsius --- compared with
preindustrial temperatures --- **all hell will break loose**, the UN
says]{.underline}. There will be catastrophic flooding, drought, more
weather extremes. Hundreds of millions will be susceptible to poverty by
midcentury. Even at 1.5 degrees, terrible things will happen. To
[be]{.underline} clear, we are **[highly skeptical]{.underline}** [of
these **doom-and-gloom scenarios**]{.underline}. **[Past
predictions]{.underline}** [of global]{.underline} [warming
**catastrophes**]{.underline} [have **failed to emerge**]{.underline}.
In the U.S., for example, [there\'s been **no trend toward** more
extreme weather, drought or flooding, even though the planet has already
warmed 1 degree Celsius]{.underline}. This year\'s tornado season, in
fact, has been the mildest on record. What\'s more, [environmentalists
have issued]{.underline} these [\"**[point of no return\"
warnings]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[decades]{.underline}**](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/al-gore-runs-global-warming-racket/),
**[only to revise them once the supposed deadline passes]{.underline}**.
**[Global Warming Is Inevitable]{.underline}** [But **even if the
alarmist predictions are true**]{.underline}, [there\'s]{.underline}
**[nothing that can plausibly be done at this point to stop it.
That\'s]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} real **[message]{.underline}**
[of the]{.underline} annual [UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change]{.underline} \[**[IPCC]{.underline}**\] [report]{.underline}. The
chart contained in the [\"Summery for
Policymakers\"](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf) shows
projected changes in global temperatures over the next 100 years. It
also shows that [temperatures will **top**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} supposed [1.5-degree limit by]{.underline} around
**[2040]{.underline}**, **[even if the world makes drastic
reductions]{.underline}** [in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
within the next two decades. **How drastic?**]{.underline} **[The UN\'s
forecasts all assume that the entire world become entirely carbon free
by 2055]{.underline}** ... at the latest. [That\'s just 37 years from
now.]{.underline} It also assumes that the world makes massive
reductions in other greenhouse gases, such as methane. **[Here\'s an
example of what the UN says would have to happen within the next 12
years to meet that goal]{.underline}**. Keep in mind, [this is **the low
end** of the UN\'s proposed changes]{.underline}. **[60%]{.underline}**
[of the world\'s energy]{.underline} would have to come [from
renewable]{.underline} sources [by]{.underline} **[2030]{.underline}**,
[and 77% by 2050]{.underline}. ([The]{.underline} **[Department of
Energy]{.underline}** [forecasts that renewables will]{.underline}
[account for]{.underline} just **[27%]{.underline}** [of the
U.S.\'s]{.underline} electric power generation [by
**2050**]{.underline}.) **[Coal use]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}
[have to drop]{.underline} **[78%, oil 37% and natural gas
25%]{.underline}** --- [compared with 2010 levels]{.underline} ---
[within]{.underline} **[12 years]{.underline}**. ([Last
year]{.underline}, **[global coal demand increased]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} use of natural [gas has]{.underline} **[massively
climbed]{.underline}** in the U.S.) [There\'d have to be a]{.underline}
59% [increase in nuclear power by]{.underline} 2030, and a **[150%
increase by 2050]{.underline}**. (**[Good luck]{.underline}** getting
environmentalist to buy into that). **[Farmers]{.underline}** [would
have to]{.underline} figure out how to [cut methane]{.underline}
emissions [by]{.underline} **[24% by 2030]{.underline}**, (and still
feed a growing worldwide population). **[Even those massive reductions
won\'t produce enough CO2 reductions it.]{.underline}** So, the UN
assumes the world will also remove massive amounts of CO2 from the
atmosphere. That\'s despite the fact that nobody knows how to do that
today. **[Unprecedented, Or Wishful Thinking?]{.underline}** [The UN
itself admits that achieving anything like these levels of greenhouse
gas reductions \"would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in
energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial
systems]{.underline}.\" It goes on to say that such an undertaking would
be \"unprecedented in terms of scale.\" And [it would require a
\"significant upscaling of investments.\" In other words]{.underline},
**[massive amounts of money]{.underline}**. [To say that changes of this
magnitude **within that time frame** are **unrealistic** would be
**putting it mildly**]{.underline}. **[The last big attempt to get the
world to cut CO2 emissions turned out to be a farce]{.underline}**. As
the UN itself admitted, the CO2 reduction pledges made by the 195
countries that signed on to the **[Paris]{.underline}** Accords [[won\'t
come **anywhere close** the level of CO2 reductions it says are
needed](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/the-un-admits-that-the-paris-climate-deal-was-a-fraud/)
to avoid \"catastrophe.\"]{.underline} And [countries **aren\'t even
living up to those pledges**]{.underline}. [In the **EU,**]{.underline}
[carbon emissions started]{.underline} **[climbing]{.underline}** again
last year. [Germany is way off its carbon reduction goals, despite plans
to spend \$580 billion to overhaul its energy system]{.underline}. A
recent report showed that only nine of 195 countries have submitted
their CO2 reduction plans to the UN. **[Does anyone honestly believe
that these countries will suddenly decide to entirely decarbonize their
economies in three decades?]{.underline}** **[Adapting To Global
Warming]{.underline}** So, if **[the chances of avoiding a climate
\"catastrophe\" are gone]{.underline}**, what should be done? Sure, we
can research carbon removal technology. And, as the U.S. has shown, a
free-market economy --- simply by encouraging cost cutting and
efficiency --- can generate CO2 reductions without the heavy hand of
government. But in our view, **[the most prudent course of action isn\'t
to wreck the global economy in hopes that it might make a small
difference in the climate 100 years from now]{.underline}**. The more
reasonable approach is to adapt to whatever changes do occur. [Even if
the **horror stories**]{.underline} [told by
environmentalists]{.underline} [come to pass]{.underline}, [mankind
**can and will adjust**]{.underline}. After all, [the human race has
shown the ability to survive in the **most extreme
climates**]{.underline}. And it\'s done so [with]{.underline} **[far
less technological sophistication]{.underline}**. [We\'ve learned to
live in deserts. And in the Arctic. In hurricane alleys and earthquake
zones]{.underline}. [The idea that we **won\'t be able** to handle
changes caused by a **slightly warmer planet over the next millennium is
ludicrous**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, if the environmentalists\' horror
stories don\'t come true, we won\'t have wasted trillions upon trillions
of dollars tilting at windmills.

#### Long timeframe and adaptation solves 

Robert O. **Mendelsohn 9**, the Edwin Weyerhaeuser Davis Professor, Yale
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, June
2009, "Climate Change and Economic Growth," online:
http://www.growthcommission.org/storage/cgdev/documents/gcwp060web.pdf

The heart of the debate about **[climate change]{.underline}** comes
from a number of warnings from scientists and others that give the
impression that human-induced **[climate change]{.underline}** is an
immediate threat to society (IPCC 2007a,b; Stern 2006). Millions of
people might be vulnerable to health effects (IPCC 2007b), crop
production might fall in the low latitudes (IPCC 2007b), water supplies
might dwindle (IPCC 2007b), precipitation might fall in arid regions
(IPCC 2007b), extreme events will grow exponentially (Stern 2006), and
between 20--30 percent of species will risk extinction (IPCC 2007b).
Even worse, there may be catastrophic events such as the melting of
Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets causing severe sea level rise, which
would inundate hundreds of millions of people (Dasgupta et al. 2009).
Proponents argue there [is]{.underline} no time to waste. Unless
greenhouse gases are cut dramatically today, economic growth and
well‐being may be at risk (Stern 2006). These statements are largely
**[alarmist and misleading]{.underline}**. Although [climate
change]{.underline} is a serious problem that deserves attention,
society's immediate behavior has an **[extremely low
probability]{.underline}** of leading to **[catastrophic
consequences]{.underline}**. The science and economics of climate change
is quite clear that emissions over the next few decades will lead to
only **[mild consequences]{.underline}**. The severe impacts predicted
by alarmists require a century (or two in the case of Stern 2006) **[of
no mitigation]{.underline}**. Many of the predicted impacts assume there
will be **[no or little adaptation]{.underline}**. The net economic
impacts from climate change over the next 50 years will be small
regardless. Most of the more **[severe impacts]{.underline}** will take
more than a century or even a **[millennium]{.underline}** to unfold and
many of these "potential" impacts **[will never occur because people
will adapt]{.underline}**. It is not at all apparent that
**[immediate]{.underline}** and dramatic policies need to be developed
to thwart long‐range climate risks. What is needed are long‐run balanced
responses.

#### No resource wars -- prefer statistical evidence

**Pinker 11** (Steven, Harvard College Professor and Johnstone Family
Professor in the Department of Psychology -- Harvard University, "The
Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined," Google Books)

Once again it seems to me that the appropriate response is \"maybe, but
maybe not.\" Though [climate change]{.underline} can cause plenty of
misery and deserves to be mitigated for that reason alone, it [will not
necessarily lead to armed conflict]{.underline}. The [political
scientists who track war and peace]{.underline}, such as Halvard Buhaug,
Idean Salehyan, Ole Theisen, and Nils Gleditsch, [are skeptical of the
popular idea that people fight wars over scarce resources]{.underline}.
[Hunger and resource shortages are tragically common]{.underline} in
sub-Saharn countries such as Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania, [but wars
involving them are not]{.underline}. [Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and
tsunamis]{.underline} (such as the disastrous one in the Indian Ocean in
2004) [do not generally lead to armed conflict]{.underline}. [The
American dust bowl]{.underline} in the 1930s, to take another example,
[caused plenty of deprivation but no civil war]{.underline}. [And while
temperatures have been rising steadily]{.underline} in Africa during the
past fifteen years, [civil wars and war deaths have been
falling]{.underline}. [Pressures on access to land and water
can]{.underline} certainly [cause local skirmishes]{.underline}, [but a
genuine war requires that hostile forces be organized and
armed]{.underline}, [and that depends more on the influence of bad
governments, closed economies, and militant ideologies than on the sheer
availability of land and water]{.underline}. Certainly any connection to
terrorism is in the imagination of the terror warriors: terrorists tend
to be underemployed lower-middle-class men, not subsistence farmers. As
for genocide, the Sudanese government finds it convenient to blame
violence in Darfur on desertification, distracting the world from its
own role in tolerating or encouraging the ethnic cleansing. [In a
regression analysis on armed conflicts]{.underline} from 1980 to 1992,
Theisen found that [conflict was more likely if a country was poor,
populous, politically unstable, and abundant in oil]{.underline}, [but
not if it had suffered from droughts, water shortages, or mild land
degradation]{.underline}. (Severe land degradation did have a small
effect.) [Reviewing analyses that examined a large number (N) of
countries **rather than cherry-picking one or two**]{.underline}, he
[concluded, \"those who foresee doom, because of the relationship
between resource scarcity and violent internal conflict, have **very
little support in the large-N literature**]{.underline}.\" Salehyan adds
that [relatively inexpensive advances in water use and agriculture
practices]{.underline} in the developing world can [yield]{.underline}
massive [increases in productivity with a constant or even shrinking
amount of land]{.underline}, and that [better governance can
mitigate]{.underline} the human costs of [environmental
damage]{.underline}, as it does in developed democracies. Since the
[state of the environment is at most **one ingredient in a mixture**
that depends far more on political and social organization]{.underline},
[resource wars are far from inevitable, even in a climate-changed
world]{.underline}.

What about the economic value of biodiversity? [Biodiversity represents
**nature\'s greatest**]{.underline} largess or **[excess]{.underline}**
since [species appear **nearly as numerous as the stars**]{.underline}
the Drifters admired, except that \"[scientists have a better
understanding of how many stars there are in the galaxy than how many
species there arc on Earth]{.underline}.\"70 Worldwide [the variety of
biodiversity is **effectively infinite**]{.underline}; [the myriad
species of plants and animals, not to mention microbes]{.underline} that
arc probably more important, apparently **[exceed our ability to count
or identify them]{.underline}**. [The \"next\" or \"incremental\"
thousand species taken at random would not fetch a market price because
another thousand are **immediately available**]{.underline}, [and
another thousand after that.]{.underline} No one has suggested an
economic application, moreover, for any of the thousand species listed
as threatened in the United States.77 To defend these species - or the
next thousand or the thousand after that - on economic grounds is to
trade convincing spiritual, aesthetic, and ethical arguments for bogus,
pretextual, and disingenuous economic ones.78 As David Ehrenfeld has
written, [We do not know how many \[plant\] species are needed lo keep
the planet green and healthy, but it seems very unlikely to be anywhere
near the more than quarter of a million we have now]{.underline}. Even a
mighty dominant like the American chestnut, extending over half a
continent, all but disappeared without bring¬ing the eastern deciduous
forest down with it. And if we turn to the invertebrates, the source of
nearly all biological diversity, [what biologist is willing to find a
value]{.underline} - conventional or ecological - [for all 600,000-plus
species of beetles?7]{.underline}\* [The disappearance in the wild
**even of agriculturally useful species** appears to have **no effect on
production**]{.underline}. [The last wild aurochs, the progenitor of
dairy and beef cattle, went extinct in Poland in 1742, yet no one
believes the beef industry is threatened]{.underline}. The [genetic
material]{.underline} of crop species [is contained in tens of thousands
of landraces]{.underline} and cultivars in use - rice is an example -
[and **does not depend on the persistence of wild ancestral
types**]{.underline}. **[Genetic engineering can introduce DNA from
virtually any species into virtually any other]{.underline}** - [which
allows for]{.underline} the **[unlimited creation of
biodiversity.]{.underline}** A neighbor of mine has collected about
4,000 different species of insects on his two-acre property in Silver
Spring, Maryland. These include 500 kinds of Lepidoptera (mostly
moths) - half the number another entomologist found at his residence.80
When you factor in plants and animals, the amount of \"backyard
biodiversity\" in suburbs is astounding and far greater than you can
imagine.8\' [Biodiversity has **no value** \"at the margin\" because
**nature provides far more of it than anyone could possibly
administer**. If one kind of moth flies off, you can easily attract
hundreds of others.]{.underline}

#### Climate change is [not]{.underline} catastrophic --- their impacts [exaggerate]{.underline}.

[Humans are a **tough and adaptable** species. People live on the
equator and in the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. We
survived the ice ages with primitive technologies. The idea that climate
change poses an existential threat to humankind is
**laughable**]{.underline}. [Climate change will have
consequences]{.underline}, of course. Since different plants and animals
thrive in different climates, it will affect natural ecosystems and
agriculture. Warmer and wetter weather will advance the spread of
tropical diseases. Seas will rise, putting pressure on all that lives on
the coast. [These impacts sound alarming but they need to be **put in
perspective** before we draw conclusions about policy]{.underline}.
[According to]{.underline} Monday's report by [the
I]{.underline}ntergovernmental [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange, a further warming of 2C
could cause losses equivalent to 0.2-2 per cent of world gross domestic
product. On current trends, that level of warming would happen some time
in the second half of the 21st century. In other words, [half a century
of climate change is about as bad as losing one year of economic
growth]{.underline}. Since the start of the crisis in the eurozone, the
income of the average Greek has fallen more than 20 per cent. [Climate
change is not]{.underline}, then, [the biggest problem facing humankind.
It is not even its biggest environmental problem. The W]{.underline}orld
[H]{.underline}ealth [O]{.underline}rganisation [estimates that about 7m
\[million\] people are now dying each year as a result of air pollution.
Even on the most pessimistic estimates, climate change is not expected
to cause loss of life on that scale **for another 100
years**]{.underline}.

#### No impact to warming -- empirics, adaption, and their science is flawed

**Shani 15** (Amir Shani -- PhD @ the University of Central Florida,

Campus. Boaz Arad -- spokesman in the Public Policy Center at the
Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies, "There is always time for
rational skepticism: Reply to Hall et al," April 2015, ScienceDirect)

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [over earth\'s
history there have been **distinct warm periods** with temperatures
**exceeding the current ones**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012,
McIntyre and McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing
the relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the recent]{.underline}
(1975--2000) [increase in the earth\'s mean temperature does not appear
to be **unusual** or **unprecedented**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC
and many supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p.
1568). Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The IPCC warns
that climate change is likely to have severe consequences, particularly
for poor countries, such as increased hunger, water shortages,
vulnerability to extreme weather events and debilitating diseases.
**However**, these estimations have been **heavily criticized** for
failing to properly account for **substantial improvements in adaptive
capacity**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the impact
of global warming) [that are likely to occur due to advances in
**economic development**, **technological change** and **human capital**
over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany, 2007). [Fostering economic
growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use
of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will strengthen both industrialized and
developing countries\' **adaptive capacity** to deal not just with
possible future climate change consequences, but also with other
environmental and public health problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will
**provide greater benefits** at lower costs than drastic climate change
mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Goklany, 2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore,
the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current
state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission
reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially
in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize
atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous
advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing
(Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, [**even if** every
industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets set by
the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [such efforts are likely to have
**little effect**]{.underline}, [particularly in the light of the
considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by rising economic
superpowers as **China** and **India**, as well as the **remaining
developing world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized
us for choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural processes
potentially affect climate in specific locations and times." Yet the
purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by
the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent
extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are the
consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Moreover,
data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme
weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average annual death
and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%,
respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and
technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase
globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC\'s
exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an
op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol
(2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading
authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its over alarmist
assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity\'s
adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[Humans are a **tough** and
**adaptable** species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in
the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. [**We survived ice
ages** with]{.underline} **[primitive technologies]{.underline}**. [The
idea that climate change poses an existential threat to humankind
is]{.underline} **[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

### 2NC Renewables Turn -- Warming Inevitable 

#### Warming inevitable, even a ZERO CARBON United States wouldn't be sufficient

U.N. climate conferences have become increasingly irrelevant, in large
part because the approach taken is unworkable. International
negotiations have centered on placing the economic burden of addressing
climate change on a few dozen developed countries while asking little or
nothing from more the 150 developing countries. But [the primary source
of GHG emissions is **increasingly** the developing world, most
notably]{.underline} from large developing economies such as [China and
India]{.underline}. [Even if the U.S. cut **100 percent** of its CO2
emissions it would not make a significant difference in projected global
warming]{.underline}. [Using the same climate sensitivity]{.underline}
(which is arguably higher than reality) [as the IPCC assumes in its
modeling, the world would only be **0.137 degrees** Celsius **cooler by
2100** if the U.S. cut its CO2 emissions by **100
percent**]{.underline}. [If the entire industrialized world cut its CO2
emissions by 100 percent it would avert warming by only 0.278 degrees
Celsius]{.underline} by the turn of the century.\[36\] Using the IPCC's
own assumptions, [to have a meaningful impact on global
temperatures]{.underline}, any agreement [would require significantly
reduced emissions from both developed and developing
countrie]{.underline}s. [Such a course would be **economically
devastating**]{.underline}, however, [and was]{.underline} one [reason
why Canada pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, and why Japan, Russia, and
Canada have said they would not commit to a new treaty with binding
commitments to reduce emissions]{.underline}.\[37\]
[Proponents]{.underline} of an international agreement and the UNFCCC
[point to China and India's commitment to reduce CO2 emissions as
evidence that the developing world is serious about]{.underline} such
[reductions]{.underline}. For example, [China agreed to peak its GHG
emissions by 2030. Non-binding promises to cut emissions 14 years from
now are a small price to pay for continuing the status quo]{.underline}.
In fact, [China has been **grossly underreporting** its CO2 emissions
and use of coal]{.underline}. According to a [November 2015 article from
The New York Times]{.underline}: [China, the world's leading emitter of
greenhouse gases from coal, has been burning up to 17 percent more coal
a year than the government previously disclosed]{.underline}, according
to newly released data. The finding could complicate the already
difficult efforts to limit global warming. Even for a country of China's
size, the scale of the correction is immense. [The sharp upward
revision]{.underline} in official figures [means]{.underline} that
[China has released]{.underline} much [more carbon dioxide---almost a
billion more tons a year]{.underline} according to initial
calculations---[than previously estimated]{.underline}.\[38\] [What are
the odds that China will be more forthright and transparent in the
future when accuracy could have an **actual impact?**]{.underline}
Further, [China's refusal to address its current severe **air** and
**water quality** problems,]{.underline} neither of which has anything
to do with reducing GHG emissions, [should raise serious concerns as to
whether China will follow through with any commitment]{.underline}.
[China's improved standards of living have been accomplished **through**
the use of **CO2-emitting** conventional **energy**.]{.underline}
China's GDP per capita has increased from a little more than \$300 in
1990 to nearly \$7,000 today.\[39\] This growth is impressive, [but
China's per capita GDP is still a fraction of the developed
world\'s]{.underline}. [Decarbonization would **hinder** China's
economic **growth**, which is why authorities have resisted calls to
restrict GHG emissions]{.underline} in previous agreements. [China is
unlikely to honor its promises in 2030 if it would hamper continued
economic growth]{.underline}. [India's pledged cuts are similarly
**dubious**]{.underline}. [India recently vowed to cut its carbon
intensity by 33 percent to 35 percent by 2030]{.underline}.\[40\]
[However, roughly 22 percent of Indians still do not have access to
electricit]{.underline}y.\[41\] [Domestic political pressures to
increase access to electricity and living standards are going to be
**far more pressing than international promises**]{.underline} to make
GHG emissions cuts. [Closer inspection]{.underline}, however,
[reveals]{.underline} that [India]{.underline} has already incorporated
this reality into its pledge. [The promised reductions are **not for CO2
emissions, but** for cuts in the ratio of CO2 emissions to GDP, i.e.,
**emissions intensity**]{.underline}. [This ratio will go down so long
as CO2 emissions rise less rapidly than GDP]{.underline}. For example,
the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy dropped by more than 45 percent
between 1981 and 2011 even as CO2 emissions rose 18 percent.\[42\]
[India's GDP is projected to rise from \$1.15 trillion in
2005]{.underline} (the base year for India's promised cuts) to \$6.9
trillion in 2030.\[43\] [Over the same span CO2 emissions are projected
to rise from 1.2 gigatons]{.underline} (Gt) to 3.8 Gt.\[44\] Simple
division shows that the CO2 intensity in 2005 was 1.05 Gt per trillion
dollars and that it is expected to drop to 0.577 Gt per trillion dollars
in 2030. Therefore[, projections for India's GDP and CO2 emissions
combine to predict that a **business-as-usual** scenario]{.underline}
(one without any policies beyond those currently in place) [will lead to
a 45 percent reduction in India's carbon intensity by 2030.]{.underline}
The promised cuts are 33 percent to 35 percent. In other words, if
[India does nothing at all, it is likely to more than meet its "bold
commitment.]{.underline}"

What would happen to the climate if we were to stop emitting carbon
dioxide today, right now? Would we return to the climate of our elders?
The simple answer is no[. Once we release the carbon dioxide stored in
the fossil fuels we burn, it accumulates in and moves amongst the
atmosphere, the oceans, the land, and the plants and animals of the
biosphere.]{.underline} The released **[carbon dioxide will remain in
the atmosphere for thousands of years]{.underline}**. [Only after many
millennia will it return to rocks]{.underline}, for example, through the
formation of calcium carbonate -- limestone -- as marine organisms\'
shells settle to the bottom of the ocean. But [on time spans relevant to
humans, once released the carbon dioxide is in our environment
essentially forever]{.underline}. It does not go away, unless we,
ourselves, remove it. [If we stop emitting today, it\'s not the end of
the story for global warming. There\'s a delay in temperature increase
as the climate catches up with all the carbon that\'s in the
atmosphere.]{.underline} [After]{.underline} [maybe 40 more years, the
climate will stabilize at a temperature higher than what was
normal]{.underline} for previous generations. This decades-long lag
between cause and effect is due to the long time it takes to heat the
the ocean\'s huge mass. The energy that is held at the Earth by the
increased carbon dioxide does more than heat the air. It melts ice; it
heats the ocean. Compared to air, it\'s harder to raise the temperature
of water -- it takes time, decades. However, once the ocean temperature
is elevated, it adds to the warming of the Earth\'s surface. [So even if
carbon emissions stopped completely right now, as the oceans catch up
with the atmosphere, **the Earth\'s temperature would rise about another
1.1F**]{.underline} (0.6C). Scientists refer to this as committed
warming. [Ice,]{.underline} also responding to increasing heat in the
ocean, [will continue to melt]{.underline}. There\'s already convincing
evidence that significant glaciers in the West Antarctic ice sheets are
lost. Ice, water, and air -- the extra heat held on the Earth by carbon
dioxide affects them all. That which has melted will stay melted -- and
more will melt. [Ecosystems]{.underline} are altered by natural and
manmade occurrences. As they recover, it [will be in a different
climate]{.underline} from that in which they evolved. [The climate in
which they recover will not be stable; it will be continuing to
warm]{.underline}. **[There will be no new normal, only more
change.]{.underline}**

## Neg AT: Russia Turn 

### 2NC Russia Turn -- Demographic Thumper 

#### Russian economic collapse is inevitable due to demographic problems -- policy fails

**Russell 18** (Martin Russell, European Parliamentary Research Service.
"Seven economic challenges for Russia". July 2018.
<http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/625138/EPRS_IDA(2018)625138_EN.pdf>)

2.3.1. A [shrinking and ageing population **weighs heavily on the
economy**]{.underline} In 2017, [Economic Development
Minister]{.underline} Maksim [Oreshkin described Russia\'s demographic
situation as **\'one of the most difficult in the
world\'**.5]{.underline}1 That situation is largely due to the
after-effects of the chaotic 1990s, a period when economic instability
discouraged families from having children. As a result, [there are now
**far fewer** young people entering the workforce or opting to have
families]{.underline} of their own. [Total population is
**stagnating**]{.underline}, but the working-age population has already
declined from 90 million in 2005 to its current level of 83 million. As
the effects of the 1990s demographic dip continue to feed through,
forecasts suggest that [total population could, in the worst case,
shrink by 10 million]{.underline} over the next 20 years, while the
workforce sheds up to 8 million (-10 %; see Figure 8). To encourage more
Russians to have children, in 2007 the government introduced a maternity
capital programme, under which parents receive a voucher worth around €6
000 per child for second and subsequent children, which among other
things can be used to help buy or renovate an apartment. In November
2018, Vladimir [Putin announced additional support]{.underline}, in the
form of an allowance to be paid to less well-off families during the
first 18 months of their first child. However, such [measures are not
expected to **significantly** offset the underlying **negative
demographic trends** mentioned abov]{.underline}e (a surge in birth
rates after the introduction of the maternity capital programme was in
fact largely the result of parents from a 1980s baby boom entering
reproductive age; since 2014, birth rates have started declining
again52). Apart from falling birth rates, there are several other
reasons why the workforce is smaller than it could be. Retirement ages
(60 for men, 55 for women) are among the lowest in the world. Many
Russians are in poor health (life expectancy at birth is nine years less
than the EU-28 average); in the 2010-2015 period, 37 % of Russian
employees died before reaching retirement -- twice the percentage in
France. 53 [Apart from **unhealthy lifestyles**]{.underline}
([alcoholism, smoking and drugs are estimated to cause nearly two-fifths
of deaths]{.underline}), [Russia simply does not spend enough
money]{.underline}: in 2016, government [healthcare expenditure was a
mere 3.8 % of GDP]{.underline}, 55 only half as much as in advanced OECD
economies; including private spending, that figure rises to 5.6 % of
GDP, again much less than the OECD average of 9 %. 56 In 2018, the
government envisages a modest increase in healthcare spending to 4.1 %
of GDP; however, Vladimir Putin argues that in the longer term, the
country needs to spend twice as much on health as it does now. 57 On top
of this, [there is a **persistent brain drain**]{.underline}: since
2012, the [number of Russians leaving the country has
**tripled**]{.underline}, reaching 250 000 in 2016. 58 More worrying
than the actual number of emigrants is the fact that [many of them are
researchers, entrepreneurs and people with IT skills looking for more
attractive economic opportunies abroad -- the very people that Russia\'s
economy can **least afford to lose.**]{.underline} 59 This is at least
good news for jobseekers. Even during the recent recession, unemployment
remained close to 5 %, except in impoverished regions such as
Ingushetia, which has the country\'s highest jobless rate (26 %). 60
However, it is much more worrying for [employers]{.underline}, who [are
already struggling to find **specialists**]{.underline}, for example in
the technology sector. 61 The resulting [skills shortage **seriously
constrains** the Russian economy]{.underline}, costing it 0.4 % of
growth a year, according to one estimate. 62 Apart from exacerbating the
skills shortage, [demographic change will make it harder to finance
**pensions**]{.underline}, as fewer employees are paying social security
contributions. Rural depopulation is another impact; thousands of
villages have already been abandoned, and those that remain lack basic
facilities, making it even harder to retain young people. 63
**[Migration]{.underline}** (mostly from the ex-Soviet central Asian
republics of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) is helping to offset
the effects of low birth rates, but [does little to address the skills
shortage, as most migrants are **unskilled labourers**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [hostility towards central Asian migrants is
widespread]{.underline} (in a February 2017 survey, 38 % of respondents
admitted negative feelings towards them64), [a factor that **limits**
Russia\'s capacity to integrate large numbers of migrants.]{.underline}

### 2NC Russia Turn -- Other Commodities Solve 

#### **Arms exports are key to Russia's econ -- they outweigh and fill in for collapse oil prices** 

**Ehrlich 15** (Fritz Ehrlich, German engineer and businessman, citing
economic statistics of Russia's economy, March 3, 2015. "Why Russia
needs war (and sanctions are so important)."
http://euromaidanpress.com/2015/03/03/why-russia-needs-war-and-sanctions-are-so-important/#arvlbdata)

Whoever goes looking for the true reasons for Russia's invasion of
Ukraine doesn't need to bother with conspiracy theories. One of the most
important sources is as trivial as it is obvious: because there is money
to be made. And precisely at this moment **[Russia's economy is hanging
by a thread on weapons exports.]{.underline}** [Earnings from oil and
gas **have collapsed**]{.underline}, even [turning into]{.underline}
**[losses]{.underline}**. [Russia doesn't export significant quantities
of anything apart from]{.underline} from raw materials and
**[armaments]{.underline}**. With 27% of the global market, Russia is
the second-largest supplier of large weapons systems after the USA
(29%). However, while the US has tightened its spending, [Russia
massively increased its defense budget in the 2000s, thereby securing
long-term delivery contracts for the defense industry]{.underline}. An
important difference to the US: [While the US economy is diversified and
highly developed]{.underline}, **[Russia's economy can barely survive
without the military-industrial complex]{.underline}**. [It
would]{.underline} simply [be]{.underline} **[massive hit for the
economy]{.underline}**. According to my analysis, at least 30% -- if not
**[50%]{.underline}** -- [of Russian industry is]{.underline} directly
or indirectly [tied to the defense sector]{.underline}. As a reminder,
it was up to 80% in Soviet times. This is what makes Russia so
dangerous. Of course, 20 years ago the West had already started to help
Russia with investments in peaceful industries and technologies. But, it
didn't achieve anything; Russia continued to focus on armaments and
systematically prepared its population for war. New, imagined enemies
were created, while the reasonable worries of the Russian people were
allayed with the supposed invincibility provided by the country's
nuclear arsenal. In light of these clear facts, the attempts to reach a
peaceful resolution only using diplomacy -- and not economic pressure --
seem detached from reality. The West will only solve this problem in the
long run with the help of Russians themselves. For this to happen,
Russians must realize that the leadership under Putin carries the
responsibility for the economy being "top heavy" -- balanced on only a
few pillars, one of them being the war business. This misguided Russian
policy can only be papered over by winning new weapons deals, which
Russia accomplishes by creating new markets for its weapons systems,
that is, by fueling and conducting wars. As macabre as it sounds,
successes in the field are still the best argument for buying any
product. And Russia has exactly this kind of practical experience after
waging plenty of wars over the past years: Transnistria, Yugoslavia
(yes, Russian equipment was also tested and deployed there, particularly
on the Serbian side), Abkhazia, Chechnya, Ossetia, and now Crimea and
the Donbas. Anyone who happens to have the chance to listen Russian arms
dealers at military trade shows will hear the sales pitches, with direct
references to specific battles, regions and operating conditions.

### 2NC Russia Turn -- Low Oil Prevents Russian War

#### Increasing oil prices drives Russian aggression and military modernization -- low prices force domestic focus

[Considering that]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [is little more

the global price of oil reached **historic highs**]{.underline}. So long
as the global price of oil remained at or above \$80 per barrel, Russia
benefited. **[Moscow longs for high global energy prices to fuel its
geostrategic return to greatness]{.underline}**. It was during this
period that Russian President Vladimir Putin took to the podium at the
infamous Munich Security Conference and gave an hourlong tirade against
U.S. foreign policy. [This moment essentially was Putin's **declaration
of [a new cold
war](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Lost-Russia-World-Entered/dp/1786072521/ref=sr_1_1?crid=J5QWKNUFMAX2&keywords=who+lost+russia&qid=1556479627&s=books&sprefix=who+lost+russi%2Caps%2C188&sr=1-1)**]{.underline}.

**unlikely** Putin would have]{.underline} had [the **gumption to
act**]{.underline} as he did. Russia's 2008 National Security Strategy
Document Following this speech, in 2008, Putin ordered his forces to
invade neighboring Georgia, in order to prevent what he feared would be
Georgia's accession into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
That same year, Russia released its national security strategy memo
explicitly outlining how Russia planned to
[dominate](https://www.amazon.com/Race-Whats-Left-Scramble-Resources/dp/1250023971/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2EVF1ISXD1OIT&keywords=the+race+for+what%27s+left&qid=1556479695&s=books&sprefix=the+race+for+what%27s%2Cstripbooks%2C121&sr=1-1)
the mineral resources of the Arctic.
[According](https://jamestown.org/program/russias-national-security-strategy/)
to Jamestown Foundation's Roger McDermott: Much attention \[in the
national security strategy document\] was devoted to the potential risk
of future energy wars, in regions including the Arctic, where Russia
will defend its access to hydrocarbon resources \[emphasis added\].
Russian leaders recognized the benefits that Russia's dominant position
as a global producer of oil and natural gas had afforded them. What's
more, Russia had become a primary energy provider to neighboring Europe
and China. This gave Moscow immense strategic leverage over their
otherwise hostile neighbors. For Russia to remain a dominant and
prosperous state, Russian strategists believed they had to claim and
develop as many of these energy resources as possible. Becoming a
leading producer of oil and natural gas would be the priority for Russia
in the decades ahead, as this position would ensure Russia could make
itself as a true equal to the United States as major world power. As Oil
Prices Decline, So Does Russia What appeared to be an implacable,
resurgent Russia in 2014, soon found itself deprived of economic
security. It was shortly [after]{.underline} Russia successfully annexed
Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 that [the global price of oil
**dropped**]{.underline} precipitously. As the price plummeted, [Russian
finances]{.underline} **[collapsed]{.underline}** with it. The West then
added to Russia's woes by smothering it with sanctions and effectively
isolating it from much of the rest of the world (aside from the
second-largest economy in the world, China). And, [while **Russia's**
economic situation]{.underline} [grew **bleaker**,]{.underline}
[Putin]{.underline} ultimately [was **forced**]{.underline} [to increase
his **control at home**]{.underline}, becoming a supervillain in the
eyes of many people around the world. **[Talk of Russian military
modernization today is laughable]{.underline}**. [As soon as those
**petro-funds dried up**]{.underline} in 2014, [Moscow's]{.underline}
**[delusions of geopolitical grandeur]{.underline}** [were put on
**hold---indefinitely**]{.underline}. [Russia will remain a **spent
force** unless the world price of oil **increases**]{.underline} as it
did in from 2007-2013. [Given that five years of relatively **low oil
prices persist**]{.underline}ed[, Russia was **unlikely** to have the
means to realize its **neo-imperial dreams** any time soon]{.underline}.
But the Trump Administration's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran
means the Russian bear mightbe getting a much-needed shot of adrenaline
at an opportune time.

### 2NC Russia Turn -- Low Oil =/= Diversions 

#### No impact-- 2008 proves

**Blackwill o9** (Robert Blackwill 2009; former associate dean of the
Kennedy School of Government and Deputy Assistant to the President and

Geopolitical Consequences of the World Economic Recession---A Caution\",

[Now on to Russia]{.underline}. Again, fi ve years from today. [Did the
global recession and Russia's present serious economic problems
substantially modify Russian foreign policy? **No**.]{.underline}
(President Obama is beginning his early July visit to Moscow as this
paper goes to press; nothing fundamental will result from that visit).
[Did it produce a serious weakening of Vladimir Putin's power and
authority in Russia? **No**,]{.underline} [as recent polls in Russia
make clear]{.underline}. Did it reduce Russian worries and capacities to
oppose NATO enlargement and defense measures eastward? No. Did it aff
ect Russia's willingness to accept much tougher sanctions against Iran?
No. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has said there is no evidence that
Iran intends to make a nuclear weapon.25 In sum, [Russian foreign policy
is today on a **steady**, consistent path that can be characterized as
follows: to resurrect Russia's standing as a great power; to reestablish
Russian primary infl uence]{.underline} over the space of the former
Soviet Union; to resist Western efforts to encroach on the space of the
former Soviet Union; to revive Russia's military might and power
projection; to extend the reach of Russian diplomacy in Europe, Asia,
and beyond; and to oppose American global primacy. For [Moscow, these
foreign policy first principles are here to stay, as they have existed
in Russia for centuries]{.underline}. 26 [None of these enduring
objectives of Russian foreign policy **are likely to be changed in any
serious way by the economic crisis.**]{.underline}

#### No Russian aggression from low oil prices -- budgets 

**Snegovaya 16 (Maria Snegovaya, PhD candidate in Comparative Politics

http://globalinterests.org/2016/01/07/russias-worsening-economy-means-less-aggression-abroad-more-repression-at-home-in-2016/)**

In the foreign policy dimension, the important development is that [the
Kremlin is **running out**]{.underline} of resources [in light of
**collapsing oil prices**]{.underline} and a deepening recession.
[This]{.underline} could [lead to **less aggressive Kremlin adventures
on the international stage.**]{.underline} [Experts]{.underline} already
[predict]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [Russia's military budget
**will**]{.underline} [soon **[be
downsized]{.underline}**](http://theweek.com/articles/596822/russias-military-dont-believe-hype). As
I have shown elsewhere, [Russia]{.underline} is a [typical
petrostate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/09/to-understand-russia-think-of-it-as-an-ordinary-petrostate-as-opposed-to-an-extraordinary-superpower/): it
tends to get more aggressive when oil prices peak, and tends to **[avoid
military escalation when oil prices are low]{.underline}**.
Therefore the [scarcity of oil revenue]{.underline} in 2016 might [push
Russia towards a]{.underline} more **[compromising stance]{.underline}**
[on its Ukraine and Syria policy]{.underline}. The [recent
appointment](https://en.eadaily.com/news/2015/12/28/kremlin-explains-why-it-has-appointed-boris-gryzlov-into-contact-group-on-ukraine) of
Boris Gryzlov into Ukraine's contact group may indicate a step in that
direction**[. It is unlikely that the Kremlin has resources for a
substantive military escalation in Ukraine as of now.]{.underline}**

#### Econ isn't key to domestic stability -- other sectors solve 

**Goodrich and Zeihan 09** \[Lauren Goodrich, Stratfor\'s Director of

Thus, [while Russia\'s financial sector may be getting torn apart, the
state does **not** really **count on that sector for domestic cohesion
or stability,**]{.underline} or for projecting power abroad. [Russia
knows it lacks a good track record financially, so it depends on \-- and
has shored up]{.underline} where it can \-- [**six other pillars** to
maintain its]{.underline} (self-proclaimed) [place as a major
international player]{.underline}. The current [financial crisis would
crush the last five pillars for any other state, but in Russia, it has
only served to strengthen these bases]{.underline}. Over the past few
years, there was a certain window of opportunity for Russia to resurge
while Washington was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This
window has been kept open longer by the West\'s lack of worry over the
Russian resurgence given the financial crisis. But others closer to the
Russian border understand that [Moscow has **many tools** more potent
than finance with which to continue reasserting itself.]{.underline}

### 2NC Russia Turn -- No Russia Impact 

#### No risk of Russia war

Andrei **Tsygankov 16**, Professor at the Departments of Political
Science and International Relations at San Francisco State University,
PhD from USC, "5 reasons why the threat of a global war involving Russia
is overstated," Feb 19 2016,
http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated

The contemporary discussion of security interactions among major powers
is depressing to participants and observers alike. [Experts and
politicians are warning]{.underline} us [of]{.underline} an increasingly
[**high likelihood of a military conflict -- possibly** a **nuclear**
one -- between Russia]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and the U.S. or
NATO]{.underline}, on the other.¶ [In the West, many argue the dangers
associated with a "resurgent" Russia and]{.underline} vow to defend
themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin's "aggressive" actions
in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Last month, U.S. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter accused Russia of threatening the world order and
starkly warned: "Make no mistake, the United States will defend our
interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the
positive future it affords us all."¶ The [tensions have been
growing]{.underline} and have become especially high [since
the]{.underline} 2014 [Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. Russian military
flights over the Baltic and Black Sea in response to NATO's active
buildup on Russia's European borders has done little to calm these
fears. The Turkish decision to shoot down a Russian warplane by claiming
violation of its airspace in November 2015 revived the discussion of
Moscow's [possible military conflict with Istanbul and]{.underline}
NATO, of which Turkey is a member. More recently, the hype has been over
the Kremlin's [**alleged preparations to invade** the Baltic
States]{.underline} and the West's need to respond.¶ In Russia, these
threats and discussions are taken seriously, and the responsibility for
these security tensions has been squarely placed on the Western powers.
The frequently repeated charges are that the West and NATO have
encircled Russia with military bases and refused to recognize Moscow's
global interests. Russian media have actively discussed the U.S.
National Security Archive's Cold War documents on a nuclear attack
against Russia and China declassified on Dec. 22, 2015.¶ Last week,
while attending the Munich Security Conference, Prime Minister Dmitry
Medvedev compared the contemporary security environment with the one
that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis and reminded the audience of U.S.
President John F. Kennedy's words that "foreign policy can kill us.\"¶
In the meantime, contradicting Medvedev, Russian experts often bemoan
the fact that the Cold War was far more predictable and less dangerous
than today's multipolar world. What many have initially viewed as a
generally positive transition from the U.S. "diktat" is now presented as
leading toward a great power war.¶ This increasingly apocalyptic mood on
both sides reflects a growing international instability and breakdown of
important communication channels between Russia and the West. Since the
beginning of Ukraine crisis and up until the G20 meeting in Antalya in
December 2015, the two sides have barely interacted. Appalled by
Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for Ukrainian separatists,
Western leaders pursued policies of sanctions and isolation, whereas the
indignant Kremlin has sought to demonstrate its indifference toward such
policies.¶ Only since Antalya have Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama
resumed their attempts to regularly discuss issues of importance.
Western and Russia military, too, severed their contacts although the
two sides have recently begun to coordinate their actions in the Syrian
airspace. The aforementioned [alarmist views and arguments are
**misplaced**]{.underline} [because they underestimate the dangers of
the Cold War and **overestimate those of today's world**]{.underline}.¶
Despite some attempts to present the Cold War as generally stable,
predictable, and peaceful, this is not the time to feel nostalgic about
it. Multiple crises from Berlin to Cuba and Afghanistan extended across
much of the Cold War era. State propaganda on both sides was reinforced
by an intense ideological confrontation accompanied by drills and
necessary preparations for a nuclear war.¶ The Oscar-nominated film
"Bridge of Spies" directed by Steven Spielberg reproduces some of that
hysterical atmosphere in the United States where the public was
mobilized for any actions in support of the government. In the Soviet
Union it was no different. For the world outside the West and the
U.S.S.R., this was not a peaceful, but rather an increasingly chaotic
and violent time -- the conclusion well documented by scholars of the
Third World.¶ Why today\'s world is less dangerous than the Cold War¶
Today's world, while threatening and uncertain, is hardly more dangerous
than the Cold War, for the following reasons.¶ First, [whatever the
rhetoric, major powers are not inclined towards risky behavior when
their core interests are at stake. This concerns not only the nuclear
superpowers, but also]{.underline} countries such as [Turkey. The
prospect of confronting Russia\'s]{.underline} overwhelmingly superior
[military should give pause even to]{.underline} someone as hot-tempered
as Turkish President Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}. Even if Erdogan
wanted to pit Russia against NATO, it wouldn't work.¶ So far, [NATO has
been **careful to not be drawn into highly provocative actions**,
whether]{.underline} it is by [responding to Russia seizing the
Pristina]{.underline} International [Airport in June 1999, getting
involved on Georgia's side]{.underline} during the military conflict in
August 2008 [or]{.underline} by [providing]{.underline} lethal military
assistance and [support for Ukraine. Unless Russia is the clear and
proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to]{.underline} support Turkey and
[**begin World War III**.]{.underline}¶ Second, [Russia **remains a
defensive power**]{.underline} [aware of its responsibility for
maintaining international stability. Moscow wants to work with major
powers, not against them]{.underline}. Its insistence on Western
recognition of Russia's interests must not be construed as a drive to
destroy the foundations of the international order, such as sovereignty,
multilateralism, and arms control.¶ Third, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has important
interests to]{.underline} [prevent regional conflicts from
escalating]{.underline} or becoming trans-regional. Although its
relative military capabilities are not where they were ten years ago,
the [U.S. military and diplomatic resources are sufficient
to]{.underline} **[restrain key regional players]{.underline}** in any
part of the world. Given the power rivalry across several regions,
[proxy wars are]{.underline} possible and indeed are [happening, but
they are **unlikely to escalate**]{.underline}.¶ Fourth, unlike the Cold
War era, the contemporary world has no rigid alliance structure. The
so-called Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly more than a figment of the
imagination by American neoconservatives and some Russia
conspiracy-minded thinkers. The world remains a space in which
international coalitions overlap and are mostly formed on an ad hoc
basis.¶ Fifth, with the exception of the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Greater Syria (ISIS), there is no fundamental conflict of values and
ideologies. Despite the efforts to present as incompatible the so-called
"traditional" and "Western" values by Russia or "democracy" to
"autocracy" by the United States and Europe, the world majority does not
think that this cultural divide is worth fighting for.¶ [Despite the
dangers]{.underline} of [the world]{.underline} we live in, it [contains
a number of important]{.underline}, even [**underappreciated**,
checks]{.underline} on great powers' militarism. The [threat
talk]{.underline} coming from politicians is often deceiving. Such talk
[may be a way to **pressure the opponent** into]{.underline} various
political and military [concessions rather than to signal real
intentions. When such pressures do not bring expected
results]{.underline}, the [rhetoric of war]{.underline} and isolation
[subsides]{.underline}.¶ **[Then a dialogue begins.]{.underline}**
Perhaps, the [**increasing** frequency of **exchanges between Obama and
Putin**]{.underline} since December 2015 - [including]{.underline} their
recent [phone conversation following the Munich conference
-]{.underline} [suggest]{.underline} a growing [recognition that the
record of pressuring]{.underline} Russia [has been mixed at
best.]{.underline}

#### No Russia war

**Trenin 18** ― Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center,
Ph.D. from the Institute of the USA and Canada, Russian Academy of
Sciences, Chair of the Foreign and Security Policy Program at the
Carnegie Center, 2018. ("Fears of World War III are overblown",
Politico, July 20^th^, 2018, Available Online at:

Accessed 11-13-2018)

[As for Russia's own intentions, two things are clear. There is **no
interest** in Moscow in attacking the Baltic states or
Poland]{.underline}. These countries are as safe now as they were before
2014. Suggestions otherwise simply point to the deep wounds in both
nations' psyche, which will not be healed for many decades.

Should Ukraine's leaders decide to repeat Mikheil Saakashvili's mistake
in 2008 and launch a major offensive to retake Donbas --- however
unlikely --- the Russian response could indeed be devastating and lead
to Ukraine's loss of sovereignty, as Putin recently stated. But [does
this mean Russia will move on Ukraine unprovoked? **Most certainly
not.**]{.underline}

[Putin's main concerns are largely domestic. He has an ambitious program
that logically calls for more economic ties with the West. To move
forward, he is looking to **ease tensions with the EU and the U.S**.
What Putin wanted to get out of Helsinki was mainly to **start a
dialogue** with Washington.]{.underline}

Those hopes are now visibly going up in smoke. It is safe to bet that
Russia will continue to face the same opposition from a coalition of
U.S. and EU interests.

The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was
indeed nipped in the bud by Trump's behavior and the vehemence of his
domestic critics. So be it.

[Moscow will not capitulate]{.underline}, and will indeed [push back.
But it's **not likely** to take the form of an aggressive, overt
military attack. Fears of new wars are **far from
accurate**.]{.underline}

[There are a lot of fast-moving events happening right now]{.underline}
surrounding the latest Syrian Crisis, and it's not the point of this
article to review them all in detail, which is why the author recommends
that the reader check out his previous analysis about "[The Suspicious
Timing Of The Latest Provocations In
Syria](http://www.eurasiafuture.com/2018/04/09/the-suspicious-timing-of-the-latest-provocations-in-syria/)"
and his [follow-up Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/korybko/posts/10111842346958685) from
this morning about why the
[Alt-Media](http://www.eurasiafuture.com/2018/03/29/alt-media-debunking-the-dogma/)-driven
hype about World War III is totally misplaced. [The US-Russian standoff
has **rhetorically** escalated to the point where both Great Powers have
to do something otherwise they'll "lose face" and subsequent
"prestige",]{.underline} [which is why the US [looks ready to hit
Syria](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/984022625440747520)
while Russia may very well militarily respond]{.underline}, [but neither
of these **actions** are guaranteed to be "substantial" and could very
likely just be "**superficial**" in order to keep their **delicate
"dance"** going. The US]{.underline} **[knows]{.underline}** [that
endangering the lives of Russian servicemen would **automatically
trigger the tripwire**]{.underline} [that would necessitate Moscow
undertaking a decisive military response]{.underline}, [hence why
this]{.underline} probably **[won't happen]{.underline}** [and the
so-called "deconfliction mechanisms" will be relied upon
**instead**]{.underline} [to prevent this "dark scenario" from
materializing.]{.underline} By the same token, [Russia knows that
shooting down the US missiles will **enrage Trump**]{.underline} [and
prompt]{.underline} his "deep state" to push [him into escalating the
crisis even further in order to avoid "embarrassment",]{.underline}
which is one argument as to why it might not militarily respond to this
predictably forthcoming assault apart from the fact that it [officially
declared](https://sputniknews.com/politics/201704101052503997-russia-unlikely-counter-us-strikes/)
last year after the first one happened that it wouldn't do if any new
ones happened either. That said, [the Russian rhetoric]{.underline} on
this matter [has]{.underline} gotten to such a point -- and **[been so
widely misinterpreted by many]{.underline}** -- [that there are very
real expectations around the world for it to respond]{.underline} in one
form or another otherwise it will be "humiliated" and considered
"unreliable", and this soft power-"constructivist" impression might
actually end up influencing policy at the end of the day. However, **[it
doesn't mean]{.underline}** [that Russia will intercept Trump and his
allies' cruise missiles with S-400 ones]{.underline} [but just that it
could react through diplomatic or economic means]{.underline} like
Russian State Duma Defense Committee Chairman and former
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Airborne Troops Vladimir Shamanov
warned earlier this week. Russia is also in a predicament when it comes
to its possible response because anything less than a 100% success rate
with the S-400s might diminish their hard-earned international
reputation as the world's best anti-air and anti-missile defensive
weapons system, something that Moscow might not be willing to risk when
considering that billions upon billions of dollars of future revenue is
dependent on their sales, which become even more important in the
context of existing sanctions. [Because of the dangerous escalatory risk
that could occur if Russia's S-400s]{.underline} [take down all of
Trump]{.underline} and his allies' incoming [munitions]{.underline}
(something that Moscow said last year it wouldn't do anyway), **[as well
as the need to avoid any unexpected "flukes"]{.underline}** [that could
result in **anything less than a 100%**]{.underline} [or other similarly
"convincing" showing of this defensive system's first-ever battle-tested
capabilities]{.underline}, **[Russia is unlikely to militarily respond
to the US in any "significant" way. Nor]{.underline}**, for that matter,
**[is the US]{.underline}** [expected to "significantly" change the
balance of power]{.underline} in Syria [through its supposedly imminent
and potentially multilateral strike against the Arab
Republic]{.underline}, [meaning that both the US' actions and Russia's
reaction will probably be "**superficial**"]{.underline} [in order for
both sides to "**save face"**]{.underline} [and not risk having the
other "embarrass" them by upstaging their real military capabilities.
Russia's 100% deflection]{.underline} of the US and its allies' best
missiles [would prove that the S-400 is the most effective
system]{.underline} for preventing American-led aggression against any
country in the world; conversely, **[anything less than that or
similarly "unconvincing"]{.underline}** (and brought about by some kind
of unexpected and unusual occurrence) [would make the world think
whether rightly or wrongly that the S-400 **doesn't live up to its
"hype"** and is incapable of "saving" its customers.
Therefore]{.underline}, **[as paradoxical as it may
sound]{.underline}**, [the US-Russian standoff]{.underline} in Syria
**[might actually be "stably" managed]{.underline}** (key word, used
relatively) **[precisely because]{.underline}** [of the military
competition between these parties' offensive and defensive weapons
respectively]{.underline}, [with each of them knowing full well that
**anything other than an "ideal" performance** by either of
them]{.underline} -- [which is **impossible for both sides to pull
off**]{.underline} given that they'd be challenging one another --
[would lead to a **profound erosion** of their]{.underline} soft
[power]{.underline}, which is [a risk that neither]{.underline} of them
might be [willing to take.]{.underline}

After rallying more than 30 percent year to date, [oil prices could be
set for a **further upside**]{.underline} in coming weeks as a
combination of near-term **[bullish supply-side factors]{.underline}**
[could push prices **higher**]{.underline} than current levels. Over the
next few weeks, several **[critical geopolitical events]{.underline}**
[could set the trend]{.underline} [for even **higher oil
prices**]{.underline} in coming months. [These events]{.underline},
[combined with]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[tightening global oil
market]{.underline}**, [could leave prices vulnerable to]{.underline}
**[any sudden supply outage]{.underline}** on top of the production cuts
by OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies. Experts who have recently
spoken to
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/oil-prices-heres-what-energy-analysts-are-most-worried-about.html)
recognize the fact that [the oil market may be set for a major
disruption on the supply side]{.underline}, although they diverge on who
the single biggest disruptor may be. The three top candidates are Iran,
Venezuela, and Libya. All three OPEC producers [were
exempted](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libya-Iran-Venezuela-Secure-OPEC-Production-Cut-Exemptions.html)
from the cartel's production cuts that began in January and are expected
to last at least until June. And all three have shown so far this year
that there was good reason to be exempted---their respective production
has been either falling or volatile, and set for further disruptions in
coming weeks and months. According to Stephen Brennock, an oil analyst
with PVM Oil Associates, it's **[Libya]{.underline}** that [will pose
the **biggest geopolitical risk**]{.underline} [to oil
markets]{.underline}. [Eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered
earlier this month his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the
capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of

production in the country has yet to be disrupted however I suspect it
is a matter of when not if. General Haftar and his eastern Libyan forces
are determined to seize Tripoli and with it comes the inevitable risk of
supply outages," Brennock told CNBC in an email. Cailin Birch, global
economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), believes that it's
**[Iran]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the [U.S. sanctions on its oil
industry]{.underline} that [is the **most important**]{.underline}
[supply-side issue]{.underline}. The unpredictability of the U.S.
Administration's policy could result in the U.S. cutting off waivers for
Iranian oil customers due to expire in early May, Birch told CNBC. Many
other analysts, however, believe that the U.S.---despite its continued
talk of "maximum pressure" on Tehran and "zero exports" from Iran---will
be more lenient, again, toward the key Iranian oil buyers. The
reason---fear of driving oil (and gasoline) prices too high. Some
analysts say that with the focus on **[tightening]{.underline}** the
[sanctions on]{.underline} **[Venezuela]{.underline}** and Nicolas
Maduro's regime, the U.S. could go softer again on Iranian customers,
because those two supply disruptions combined, plus a possible outage in
Libya, [could **tighten the market**]{.underline} [too much and result
in oil prices **overshooting**]{.underline}.

### 1AR Saudi Oil DA -- Prices High 

#### Oil prices are rapidly increasing -- global supply shocks 

**Economist 19** (The Economist, April 27, 2019. "Rising oil prices
could prevent a world economic rebound."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/27/rising-oil-prices-could-prevent-a-world-economic-rebound)

THE SENSE of pessimism that hung over the world economy early this year
has begun to lift in recent weeks. Trade flows are picking up in Asia,
America's retail sales have been strong, and even Europe's beleaguered
manufacturing industry has shown flickers of life. But it would not take
much bad news to reinstate the gloom. [One threat is that]{.underline}
**[oil prices]{.underline}** [continue their]{.underline} **[upward
march]{.underline}**---on April 23rd [the price of a barrel of Brent
crude exceeded **\$74**]{.underline}, [the highest level for nearly six
months]{.underline}. Though the dynamics of the oil market have changed
over the past decade, dearer oil still acts as [a]{.underline} **[drag
on global growth]{.underline}**. The latest jump in oil prices has
resulted [from anticipation of a **shock to supply**]{.underline},
rather than surging demand (see
[article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/04/24/america-wants-to-challenge-rogue-petrostates)).
On April 22nd **[America]{.underline}** [said]{.underline} that [it
would end waivers]{.underline} granted [to]{.underline} a number of big
economies, including China, India and Turkey, [which
allowed]{.underline} them to [import]{.underline} **[Iranian
oil]{.underline}**, bypassing America's sanctions regime. [These
waivers]{.underline} were put in place after President Donald Trump
pulled out of a nuclear deal with Iran in 2018. [Their
**expiry**]{.underline} on May 2nd could [reduce]{.underline} the
[**global supply** of oil]{.underline} [by]{.underline} more than **[1m
barrels per day]{.underline}** (about 1% of the total). That is not the
only threat to supply. **[War]{.underline}** [threatens production in
**Libya**]{.underline}. [**Sanctions** against **Venezuela** have
taken]{.underline} [supply **off the market**]{.underline}. Although a
bottleneck in the Texan Permian basin will be relieved this year, it
does not produce the heavy, sour crude found in Venezuela. And, after
the American announcement, the head of Iran's navy said that if it is
prevented from using the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of
the global oil supply flows, it could try to close the waterway for
everyone else, too. [Oil inventories are **low**]{.underline}, [and it
is **far from clear**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} other
[producers]{.underline} [will increase output enough to
**compensate**]{.underline} [for the **supply shock**]{.underline}. In
the long term Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have an incentive to
avoid sky-high prices, which would lead to a new wave of capital pouring
into American shale production. But the last time the Saudis complied
with a request from the White House to pump more---after Mr Trump
scrapped the Iran deal---they were then stung by his granting of the
waivers. In public they have pledged to keep the market in balance, but
they also say there is no need for immediate action.

#### **Oil spiking now -- Middle East tensions**

**Chakraborty 6/21** \[Tirthankar Chakraborty, 6-21-2019, \"Middle East
Tensions Perk Up Oil Prices: Here\'s How to Profit,\" Yahoo Finance,
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-east-tensions-perk-oil-125212154.html\]

Wall Street has generally been apathetic to the issue of tension in the
Middle East but [flaring up tensions between the United States and Iran,
as well as Saudi Arabia and Iran has driven oil prices higher. U.S.
benchmark]{.underline} West [Texas]{.underline} Intermediate
[crude]{.underline} for July delivery [rose]{.underline} \$2.89, or
[5.4%,]{.underline} to settle at \$56.65 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, [the biggest daily gain since December. Brent
crude, the global benchmark, was up 4.3%]{.underline} at \$64.45 a
barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange, [the]{.underline} highest since
May 31 and [biggest one-day jump since Jan 9.]{.underline}

Iran's Revolutionary Guard has claimed that they recently shot down a
U.S. drone near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran alleged that the drone had
entered Iranian airspace, even though U.S. military is adamant that it
was in the international airspace. Moreover, Iran's Revolutionary
Guard's claim came after U.S. military informed of missile hit on one of
Saudi desalination plants and stated that it is likely to have come from
Yemen.

It goes without saying that while the Saudis and the United States are
on one side; the Houthi Yemenis and Iran make up the other one. The
[tensions between the Saudis and Iran can primarily be attributed to the
U.S. sanctions aimed at reducing Iranian oil exports to zero level. Iran
made quite a few attempts to evade such sanctions and even threatened to
shut down the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline} if sanctions aren't lifted.

However, [tensions in the Middle East were escalating over the past few
weeks following the damage of two tankers from Saudi Arabia, one vessel
from Norway, and one from United Arab Emirates by sabotage
attacks]{.underline} between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.

[It was wrong of everyone to play down the gravity of the Middle East
issue]{.underline}. After all, [almost 22.5 million barrels of oil pass
through the Strait of Hormuz each day since the beginning of 2018, which
is roughly 24% of the world's daily oil production]{.underline}. So,
[any disruption can lead to supply-demand disparity]{.underline},
eventually leading to elevated oil prices.

Talking about supply-demand disparity, the Energy Information
Administration reports show that U.S. crude supply fell by 3.1 million
barrels for the week ended Jun 14. Notably, OPEC's decision to convene
on Jul 1-2 to review its pledge to curb production was also another
factor that aided the price surge.

#### Iran tensions and US inventories raise prices now.

**AJ 6/20** \[Al Jazeera, 6-20-2019, \"Oil prices are up, and could go
even higher,\"
https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/oil-prices-higher-190620201754321.html\]

[Oil prices soared more than five percent]{.underline} on Thursday
[after Iran shot down a United States military drone]{.underline},
raising fears of a military confrontation between Tehran and Washington.

[Also supporting oil prices were a drop in US crude inventories and
expectations that the US Federal Reserve could cut interest
rates]{.underline} at its next meeting, [stimulating growth in the US,
which is the world\'s largest oil-consuming country.]{.underline}

\"[It\'s a confluence of events: there\'s a looming easing cycle which
is going to hit the dollar and prop up commodity prices, and there are
also the tensions with Iran]{.underline},\" said John Kilduff, a partner
at Again Capital LLC in New York.

[The security premium built into oil prices could rise further as
tensions between the US and Iran heat up]{.underline}, he said.

[Brent]{.underline} crude, the global benchmark, [rose]{.underline}
\$2.63, or [4.3 percent]{.underline}, closing at \$64.45 a barrel. US
West Texas Intermediate ([WTI]{.underline}) crude [rose]{.underline}
\$2.89, or [5.4 percent]{.underline}, to \$56.65 a barrel.

[Brent\'s premium over WTI narrowed to its lowest margin since
April]{.underline}. The change came as US crude rose more quickly than
Brent due to the tailwind provided by potential Federal Reserve policy,
said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Americas in New York.

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- No Retaliation 

#### No chance Saudi retaliates to the plan by raising prices -- they know it would hurt them too much 

**Kemp 18** (John Kemp, senior energy market analyst at Reuters, October
16, 2018. "The real reason we have nothing to fear from Saudi Arabia's
'oil weapon'."
https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/column-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-kemp)

LONDON --- **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}** [to employ its]{.underline}
[so-called]{.underline} "**[oil weapon]{.underline}**" [in]{.underline}
the **[diplomatic crisis]{.underline}** over the disappearance of a
journalist after visiting the country's consulate in Istanbul.
Experience from the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as a
diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and the
kingdom itself would be the biggest victim. **[Despite]{.underline}**
some of the **[impassioned rhetoric]{.underline}** in Saudi media,
**[self-interest]{.underline}** [makes it **improbable**]{.underline}
[the government will retaliate by]{.underline} reducing oil sales or
[trying to **drive up prices**]{.underline}. That has not stopped some
veiled [threats]{.underline} to weaponize oil production and prices, but
they [should be interpreted as an **urgent plea for
support**]{.underline} and understanding [**rather than** a]{.underline}
**[serious threat]{.underline}**. "If U.S. sanctions are imposed on
Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an economic disaster that would rock the
entire world," according to "Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and
touching this would affect oil production before any other vital
commodity," the editorial warned. If the price of oil reaching US\$80 a
barrel angered U.S. President Donald Trump, "no one should rule out the
price jumping to US\$100, or US\$200, or even double that figure," the
author said bluntly. The government's official response has been more
circumspect but it nonetheless warned that it would respond to any
action with even greater retaliation and pointed to [the
kingdom's]{.underline} "influential and vital role in the global
economy." OIL **[EMBARGO]{.underline}** [In]{.underline} [October
[1973]{.underline}](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/veiled-saudi-threat-boosts-oil-prices-already-moving-toward-100),
Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers announced that they would
start cutting production by 5 per cent per month until Israeli forces
evacuated from occupied Arab territories. In addition, Saudi Arabia and
the other Arab producers announced an embargo on oil sales to the United
States and a number of other countries. Global oil supplies had already
become tight even before the decisions to cut production and embargo the
United States, mostly as a result of low real prices during the 1950 and
1960s. Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as
much as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March
1972. In this context, the production cuts and embargo made an already
tight market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge,
short-term revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.
But the policy [was a **failure**]{.underline} in its own terms, was
[reversed]{.underline} a few **[months later]{.underline}**, [and caused
**immense long-term damage to Saudi Arabia**]{.underline} and OPEC [that
took **decades to reverse**]{.underline}. POLICY FAILURE At the most
basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated objective of
changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to withdraw from the
occupied Palestinian territories. More seriously for Saudi Arabia and
other Arab oil producers, [the **surge in prices**]{.underline}, which
rose again after the Iranian revolution in 1979, [resulted in
**permanent demand destruction**]{.underline} [and encouragement of
**alternative suppliers**]{.underline}. [Rising prices helped spur the
development of new supplies in Alaska, the North Sea, the Soviet Union
and China, which came onstream and flooded the oil market in the
1980s]{.underline}. Rising prices also encouraged a wholesale switch
away from the use of crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and
commercial heating boilers as well as in power generation. Homes and
offices in the United States and many other advanced economies switched
from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable heating using natural
gas or electricity generated from coal or nuclear. Crude oil and fuel
oil were replaced by a new generation of coal-fired power plants in the
United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s (ironically the same coal
plants that are now being closed and replaced by natural gas). [The oil
shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation of nuclear
power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain]{.underline}
and other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude. Cheap oil
had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power generation
in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under pressure. By the
late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been largely
pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal, gas and
nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never recovered.
[Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new
fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports
for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of
demand]{.underline}. In the long term, the oil embargo created the
conditions for the oil price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other
producers in the 1980s and 1990s, and from which they did not recover
until the 2000s. WEAPON MALFUNCTION [The oil weapon **does not
work**]{.underline}, [which is why Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [is
**unlikely to employ it**]{.underline} in the dispute over the
disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the
short term, Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in prices
than it lost from a reduction in sales. But **[rising
prices]{.underline}** [would hit]{.underline} the global economy and
[consumption]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}** and threaten a renewed
oil market slump within a year. [The weapon cannot be wielded in a
targeted way against specific consuming countries because the oil market
is global and fully integrated]{.underline}. Restricting supplies to
punish some countries pushes up oil prices for all consumers. Wielding
the oil weapon to pressure the United States would impose bigger costs
on China and India, which are the largest and fastest-growing oil
importers and crucial markets for the future. **[Saudi]{.underline}**
Arabia [has spent **decades**]{.underline} [marketing itself as a
**reliable oil supplier**]{.underline}, especially to customers in Asia,
[and any attempt to employ the oil weapon would **destroy that carefully
crafted reputation**]{.underline}. [Saudi Arabia's refining customers
would instead turn to Iran, Russia and the United States]{.underline}
for additional supplies and likely reconsider their long-term dependence
on the kingdom. If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponize oil
production and sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another
round of conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main
product. Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle
fuel economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of
electric vehicles. Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies
would speed the diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the
transport market just as it was pushed out of heating and power
generation in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia has spent years urging
oil-consuming countries to remember it needs "security of demand" just
as much as they need "security of supply". But weaponizing oil
production would break that understanding and provoke a backlash from
consuming countries with a concerted effort to reduce their oil imports.
Finally, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for security
(including the provision of advanced weapons systems, training,
intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and aircraft stationed in
and around the Gulf). There is no way to wield the oil weapon which
would not shake the foundations of the U.S.-Saudi alliance on which the
kingdom's defence depends, leaving it vulnerable to regional rivals,
including Iran. For all these reasons, [the **oil weapon** is
**essentially useless**]{.underline}, [an unreliable
**blunderbuss**]{.underline} [more likely to blow up the user than its
intended target, which is why Saudi Arabia is **unlikely to deploy
it**.]{.underline}

### 1AR Saudi Oil DA -- No Retaliation 

#### Saudi won't weaponize oil -- it would hurt them the most 

**Elliot 18** (Larry Elliot, economics editor at the Guardian, October
18, 2018. "Saudi Arabia has the most to lose from a sharp rise in oil
prices."
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/21/saudi-arabia-most-lose-rise-oil-prices-riyadh-weaponise-west)

The White House has not specified whether "very severe" includes the
sort of punitive economic and financial sanctions recently imposed on
Iran, but if it does [the **Saudis** say they will]{.underline}
[retaliate by **weaponising oil**.]{.underline} The message is clear.
Back off or we will hurt you just as we did in the 1970s. There would be
serious economic consequences were events to unfold in this way. The
price of crude rose after Trump announced sanctions on Iran, and Saudi
Arabia is a much more significant player. Oil prices are already
hovering around the \$80 a barrel mark and would spike to well over
\$100 a barrel should Saudi impose significant output curbs. Oil hit a
peak price, unadjusted for inflation, of [\$147 a
barrel](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities)
in the summer of 2008 and could easily return to that sort of level.
[The **question**, though, is whether the Sauds would be **dumb enough
to act in such a fashion**]{.underline}, [because the]{.underline}
lesson of 1973 is that the [short-term gains]{.underline} from cutting
off oil supplies [are]{.underline} **[outweighed]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} the [long-term costs.]{.underline} What's more, [the
costs are higher and the benefits are smaller than they were in the
1970s]{.underline}. For a start, [**new** sources of oil have
emerged]{.underline} in the past four and a half decades. [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia) was second to
**[Russia]{.underline}** in the table of oil producers in 2016, with the
**[US]{.underline}** in third place as a [result of the expansion of
shale production]{.underline}. [Saudi production matters, but not as
much as it did]{.underline}. [Developed economies are]{.underline} also
**[much less oil-intensive]{.underline}** [than they were in the
1970s]{.underline}. That's partly the result of the shift from
manufacturing to services, and partly because **[high oil
prices]{.underline}** in the 1970s [encourage]{.underline}d [industry to
become **more energy-efficient**]{.underline}. In the past 25 years, the
amount of energy needed per dollar of economic output has fallen by a
third. The two oil shocks of the 1970s -- the one in 1973-74 was
followed by a second in 1979-80 - were both followed by deep recessions
that brought the price crashing down. By the mid-1980s, a glut of crude
meant oil prices adjusted for inflation had fallen by 75% from their
peak. By then, [oil-importing countries]{.underline} had [realised their
**vulnerability**]{.underline} [and had begun
**diversifying**]{.underline} [into natural gas and
nuclear]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} **[biggest
beneficiaries]{.underline}** [of **Saudi output curbs
today**]{.underline} [would be [**solar and wind
producers**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/26/study-wind-and-solar-can-power-most-of-the-united-states)]{.underline}.
[The unit cost of renewables has already fallen]{.underline} sharply as
a result of technological advances, and **[each ratcheting
up]{.underline}** [of oil prices will make **solar and wind more
competitive**]{.underline}. [If the west has become **less
oil-dependent**]{.underline}, [the **opposite** is true for
**Saudi**]{.underline} Arabia, [which]{.underline}, according to
estimates from the International Monetary Fund, [**[needs]{.underline}**
[oil prices]{.underline} of \$85-87 a
barrel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arabia-imf/saudi-arabia-needs-oil-at-85-87-a-barrel-to-balance-budget-imf-official-idUSKBN1I30H7)
[to **balance its budget**]{.underline}. The country's reliance on [oil
revenues]{.underline} was exposed in the period between 2014 and 2016,
when the price of crude collapsed from \$110 to \$30 a barrel. During
that time, the Saudi budget deficit increased from 3.5% to 15.8% of GDP,
necessitating unpopular austerity measures for a population grown
accustomed to free public services, generous welfare benefits and
subsidised energy. Riyadh knows that it needs to diversify out of oil,
but the plan is to do so at a pace that does not lead to social unrest.
Half of the population is under the age of 25 and the unemployment rate
is more than 12%, a potentially combustible mix. The whole point of
organising an [investment
conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/liam-fox-pulls-out-of-saudi-event-over-alleged-of-jamal-khashoggi)
this week that so many western politicians are now boycotting was to
expand the non-oil sectors of the economy. **[What does all this
mean?]{.underline}** [It means]{.underline}, simply, [that the country
with **most to lose**]{.underline} [from a **sharp rise** in oil prices
would be Saudi Arabia itself]{.underline}. [Claims that
western]{.underline} sanctions [would prompt]{.underline} **[retaliatory
action]{.underline}** [of such severity]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
they [would **derail** the global economy]{.underline} [are a **gigantic
bluff**]{.underline}.

there would be]{.underline} **[no return]{.underline}** [to the embargo
era]{.underline}. [They have good reasons for that]{.underline}. The 10
million--plus barrels of oil the Saudis pump every day are far more than
the record low of roughly 2 million barrels a day the kingdom produced
in the mid-1980s, when it was trying to make prices spike. And [the
kingdom **needs American customers** to buy]{.underline} that
[oil]{.underline} in order [to fund its **economic diversification
strategy**]{.underline}, [known as]{.underline} **[Vision
2030]{.underline}**. [Its **political relationship** with **Washington**
also constrains its ability to **cut production**]{.underline}; after
Trump announced new sanctions on Iranian oil in fall 2018, the Saudi
crown prince
[promised](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-05/saudi-crown-prince-to-trump-we-ve-replaced-all-iran-s-lost-oil)
to pump more to keep the market balanced. However, Saudi Arabia is
[cutting production
again](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-06/saudi-oil-production-cuts-may-stoke-oil-prices-spur-trump-tweets)
after the United States issued waivers to its Iranian sanctions policy.
[The **Saudis** have been able to use their oil weapon **only when**
other oil producers are tapped out]{.underline}, Wald said. [With the
**American energy sector booming**]{.underline}, global markets look
very different from the '70s and '80s. [The]{.underline} [Saudi business
model has]{.underline} also **[changed]{.underline}**. **[Saudi
Aramco]{.underline}** is no longer "just drilling holes in the ground
and pumping out," Wald said. In 2017, the company [[took
over](https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/01/investing/saudi-arabia-buys-largest-oil-refinery-port-arthur/index.html)
the **largest oil refinery**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. "[The Saudis
would]{.underline} essentially [be]{.underline} **[embargoing their own
refinery]{.underline}**," Wald said. [That makes the overall
relationship safer]{.underline}. "The genius maybe of the early Saudi
kings was that they let the oil business be the oil business. They
recognized how important the money that the oil business generated was
to their own power," Wald said. Unlike countries that quickly
nationalized their oil companies, such as Iran or Venezuela, the Saudis
transitioned to national control of their oil resources over many years,
without throwing out the American expertise that made Aramco so
profitable to its owners. Wald is less confident that the current
generation of Saudi leaders will display the same cautious strategy
about their assets. A plan to sell public shares of Aramco, billed as a
move to make the secretive company more transparent, was shelved last
year. "There isn\'t the same sense of patience that some of the older
Saudi kings, the original king and some of his sons, had about this,"
Wald said. Rather than opening up, the Saudis have opted, again, for
control.

#### Saudi won't hike oil prices -- every incentive pushes them to maintain status quo rates

**Weichert 19** (Brandon J. Weichert, Master of Arts in Statecraft &
National Security Affairs from the Institute of World Politics in
Washington, D.C., April 28, 2019. "Be Careful: Hurting Iran Might Help
Russia."
https://amgreatness.com/2019/04/28/be-careful-hurting-iran-might-help-russia/)

Countering Russia's Advantages as a Petrostate It's not going to be easy
for Moscow, though. The world oil market has changed since the days when
Russia benefited disproportionately from chronically high oil prices.
[Today](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4256629-predictions-crude-oils-price-trajectory-part-2),
oil costs \$66.15 per barrel---not quite where Russia needs it to be in
order to benefit. Also, unlike a decade ago, America can saturate the
world market with oil and natural gas to keep the price relatively low,
if need be. What's more, the primary driver of
OPEC---**[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia---[needs the global price of oil
to **remain**]{.underline} [between]{.underline}
**[\$70-\$80]{.underline}** [per barrel]{.underline} to balance its
budget. [If the price goes **beyond**]{.underline} [that
range]{.underline}, [it might risk a worldwide recession]{.underline},
thereby **[harming the Saudi economy]{.underline}**. Plus, [Riyadh's
rivalry with Iran means that there is]{.underline}
**[incentive]{.underline}** [for Saudi]{.underline} Arabia
[to]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}** [the price of oil from
rising]{.underline} **[too high]{.underline}**: [the Saudis]{.underline}
need the United States to back them and they [will]{.underline}
therefore **[acquiesce]{.underline}** [to Washington's demands
to]{.underline} [keep global oil prices in **check**]{.underline}.
Although Russia and Saudi Arabia, as two of the world's leading oil
producers, have formed a close bond in recent years, theirs is not a
partnership as valuable to Riyadh as the Saudi alliance with the United
States is. Thus, it is likely that Riyadh will attempt to coordinate an
increase in oil production with both the United States and OPEC, in
order to offset any price shocks from Washington's recent moves against
Iran, effectively damaging Russian dreams of complete, geopolitical
restoration.

#### Saudi won't skyrocket oil prices -- they're incentivized to maintain the status quo 

**Economist 19** (The Economist, April 27, 2019. "Rising oil prices
could prevent a world economic rebound."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/27/rising-oil-prices-could-prevent-a-world-economic-rebound)

Oil inventories are low, and it is far from clear that other producers
will increase output enough to compensate for the supply shock. In the
long term **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and other OPEC members [have an
**incentive**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[avoid sky-high
prices]{.underline}**, [which would lead to a new wave of

## Aff Econ Scenario 

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- No Econ Collapse 

#### High oil prices won't dent the US economy -- they're key to growth 

**Klein 18** (Matthew C. Klein, senior economic writers at Barrons, May
11, 2018. "How Rising Oil Prices Will Affect the U.S."
https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-rising-oil-prices-will-affect-the-u-s-1526066957)

Four of the past five recessions---1973, 1980, 1990, and 2008---were
preceded by a sharp increase in the price of oil. Since last summer, the
[Brent benchmark oil
price](https://www.theice.com/products/219/Brent-Crude-Futures/data?mod=article_inline)
has soared by about 50%, to nearly \$78 per barrel. More increases could
be coming. [Additional sanctions on
Iran](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-iran-sanctions-put-oil-giants-in-a-bind-1525854012?mod=article_inline)
imposed by the Trump administration will limit that country's ability to
supply world markets, while the deteriorating situation in Venezuela
could mean further cuts in its production. [Rising Oil Prices: How We
Got
Here](https://www.barrons.com/articles/rising-oil-prices-how-we-got-here-1526392888?mod=hp_RTA&mod=article_inline)
The Saudi energy ministry has said it will help ["mitigate the
impact"](https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&newsid=1761056#1761056&mod=article_inline)
of potential shortages, but this may not amount to much. After all,
Saudi officials are reportedly targeting [an oil price [**as high as
\$100 per
barrel**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil-exclusive/exclusive-opecs-new-price-hawk-saudi-arabia-seeks-oil-as-high-as-100-sources-idUSKBN1HP1LB?mod=article_inline)]{.underline}
to support the valuation of Saudi Aramco before its initial public
offering. [If the **Saudis** get their way]{.underline}, average U.S.
gasoline prices could rise above \$4 per gallon, or [about 40% higher
than
today](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/?mod=article_inline).
**[Unlike past episodes]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} potential
[**doubling** of the price of oil]{.underline} since last summer
**[won't likely dent the U.S. economy's momentum]{.underline}**.
Instead, [the impact would be felt in who spends what]{.underline}.
Households will have less free cash to spend, but [**businesses** will
**offset their restraint** with additional capital
spending]{.underline}. [States at the heart of the shale
boom]{.underline}, especially New Mexico and Texas, [will grow
**faster**]{.underline} than the rest of the country. The difference is
the shale revolution. [The obvious consequence of shale is reduced
reliance on imports.]{.underline} Drilling into tight oil formations now
accounts for about 5.5 million barrels per day of U.S. crude production,
up from just 500,000 barrels a day in the summer of 2008. This has more
than doubled total U.S. output. Over the same period, U.S. oil
consumption has increased [by only about
7%](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_sum_snd_d_nus_mbbl_m_cur.htm?mod=article_inline).
The net effect is that **[two-thirds]{.underline}** [of America's total
oil demand is]{.underline} now [satisfied by domestic]{.underline}
[production]{.underline}, compared with just one-third in 2005-08. This
is less important than it may seem, however, as the U.S. was even less
dependent on imports at the time of the 1973 oil shock than it is today.
[The U.S. responds **differently**]{.underline} [to oil price moves now
than in the past because of]{.underline} the specific properties of
**[shale]{.underline}**. Oil from most other sources---conventional
wells, deep underwater, and tar sands---flows for decades after the
initial investments are made. By contrast, most of the oil that will
come out of a typical shale well is extracted in [the first three
years](https://www.eia.gov/workingpapers/pdf/elasticity_shale_oil.pdf?mod=article_inline).
Just maintaining output requires constant additional drilling. **[Rising
prices]{.underline}** quickly [encourage]{.underline} **[additional
investment]{.underline}**, while low prices lead to sharp cuts in
spending. [When oil prices were **high**, oil-related investment
provided a **fillip to the U.S. economy**]{.underline}. From the start
of 2010 through the middle of 2014, the spending boom on exploration,
shafts, wells, and machinery directly added 0.15 percentage point to the
U.S. economy's average yearly growth rate. The total impact was much
bigger, however, since the boom also [led to a **hiring
spree**]{.underline} of "roughnecks" and the emergence of a support
system to feed, house, and entertain them. Additional trucks, trains,
and pipelines were also needed to get supplies to and product from the
remote locations where the boom occurred. Taken together, [the shale
boom probably boosted the U.S. economy about 0.3 percentage point each
year during that period]{.underline}. [Oil prices]{.underline} then
**[fell]{.underline}** by more than 70% from the middle of 2014 until
the trough in early 2016. Initially, [many had hope]{.underline}d [the
drop in **energy costs** would **jolt the U.S. economy** into a faster
growth pace as consumers used the extra cash to spend more on things
they wanted]{.underline}. Consumption did accelerate, as did investment
spending on computers and housing. The boost from those sectors added
about 0.7 percentage point to the yearly growth rate of the U.S.
economy. Private domestic demand grew slightly slower during the bust
than it did when energy costs were much higher, because the
**[gains]{.underline}** in the rest of the country [were]{.underline}
**[not quite enough to offset the pain]{.underline}** in the oil patch.
[Cutbacks on drilling]{.underline} rigs, specialty equipment, and heavy
trucks **[directly subtracted]{.underline}** about **[0.4 percentage
point]{.underline}** [from the U.S. economy]{.underline} at a yearly
rate. [The **sharp recession**]{.underline} that hit [the shale
states](https://www.bea.gov/regional/index.htm?mod=article_inline)---New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas---[slowed]{.underline} the
U.S.'s yearly gross-domestic-product \[**[GDP]{.underline}**\] [growth
by]{.underline} nearly **[one percentage point]{.underline}** [from what
it otherwise would have been]{.underline}. The [unemployment rate in
Houston](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUS448UR?mod=article_inline)
rose by more than two percentage points relative to the country as a
whole. Oil prices have more than doubled since that trough. The number
of [vehicle miles
driven](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA?mod=article_inline),
which first began rising at the end of 2014, has plateaued. Demand for
crude oil from U.S. refineries [has
flatlined](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_sum_sndw_dcus_nus_w.htm?mod=article_inline).
Slowing growth in consumption spending, home building, and other nonoil
investment has shaved about 0.7 percentage point off America's yearly
growth rate. So far, **[all of these negatives]{.underline}** [have been
**completely offset**]{.underline} [by the **rebound in oil
investment**]{.underline}. The [number of active
rigs](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-reportsother&mod=article_inline)
has soared over 160%. Heavy truck sales, which are strongly correlated
to the state of the oil industry, are up by [more than
20%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HTRUCKSSAAR?mod=article_inline).
[There is room for **further growth**]{.underline} [if prices **keep
rising**]{.underline}. Despite the rebound, there are only about half as
many active rigs compared with the peak in October 2014. The recovery
has so far been concentrated in the Permian Basin, where wells can be
profitable even with oil at \$50 per barrel---which explains why New
Mexico's oil output [has grown
40%](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_m.htm?mod=article_inline)
since the end of 2014 while North Dakota's output has shrunk. [Higher
prices]{.underline} should [also **boost U.S. oil
exports**]{.underline}.

#### Economic decline [increases]{.underline} cooperation. 

Christina L. **Davis &** Krzysztof J. **Pelc 17**, Christina L. Davis is
a Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton;
Krzysztof J. Pelc is an Associate Professor of Political Science at
McGill University, "Cooperation in Hard Times: Self-restraint of Trade
Protection," Journal of Conflict Resolution, 61(2): 398-429

[Conclusion Political economy theory would lead us to expect rising
trade protection during hard times]{.underline}. [Yet **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} on this count [has been mixed]{.underline}. Some
studies find a correlation between poor macroeconomic conditions and
protection, but the worst recession since the Great Depression has
generated surprisingly moderate levels of protection. We explain this
apparent contradiction. [Our statistical findings show that under
conditions of pervasive economic crisis]{.underline} at the
international level, [states exercise more **restraint**]{.underline}
than they would when facing crisis alone. [These results throw light on
behavior not only during the crisis, but throughout the WTO
period]{.underline}, from 1995 to the present. One concern may be that
the restraint we observe during widespread crises is actually the result
of a decrease in aggregate demand and that domestic pressure for import
relief is lessened by the decline of world trade. [By **controlling**
for **product-level imports**, we show that the restraint on remedy use
is not a byproduct of declining imports]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}
**[also]{.underline}** [take into account the ability of]{.underline}
some [countries to **manipulate their currency** and demonstrate that
the relationship between crisis and trade protection **holds**
independent of exchange rate policies]{.underline}. Government
[decisions to impose costs on their trade partners by taking advantage
of their legal right to use flexibility measures]{.underline} are driven
not only by the domestic situation but also by circumstances abroad.
This [can give rise to an individual **incentive for strategic
self-restraint** toward trade partners in similar economic
trouble]{.underline}. Under conditions of widespread crisis, [government
leaders **fear** the **repercussions** that their own use of trade
protection may have on the behavior of trade partners at a time when
they cannot afford the economic cost of a trade war]{.underline}.
[Institutions provide **monitoring** and a venue for **leader
interaction** that **facilitates coordination** among
states]{.underline}. Here the key function is [to reinforce expectations
that any move to protect industries will trigger similar moves in other
countries]{.underline}. Such coordination often draws on shared
historical analogies, such as the Smoot--Hawley lesson, which form a
focal point to shape beliefs about appropriate state behavior. Much of
the literature has focused on the more visible action of legal
enforcement through dispute settlement, but this only captures part of
the story. Our research suggests that [tools of informal governance such
as leader pledges, guidance from the Director General, trade policy
reviews, and plenary meetings **play a real role** within the trade
regime]{.underline}. In the absence of sufficiently stringent rules over
flexibility measures, compliance alone is insufficient during a global
economic crisis. [These **circumstances** trigger **informal
mechanisms** that complement legal rules to **support
cooperation**]{.underline}. [During widespread crisis, legal enforcement
would be inadequate, and informal governance helps to bolster the
system]{.underline}. Informal coordination is by nature difficult to
observe, and we are unable to directly measure this process. Instead, we
examine the variation in responses across crises of varying severity,
within the context of the same formal setting of the WTO. Yet by
focusing on discretionary tools of protection---trade remedies and
tariff hikes within the bound rate---we can offer conclusions about how
systemic crises shape country restraint independent of formal
institutional constraints. Insofar as [institutions are
generating]{.underline} such [restraint]{.underline}, we offer that it
is [by facilitating informal coordination]{.underline}, since all these
instruments of trade protection fall within the letter of the law.
Future research should explore trade policy at the micro level to
identify which pathway is the most important for coordination. Research
at a more macro-historical scope could compare how countries respond to
crises under fundamentally different institutional contexts. In sum, the
determinants of protection include economic downturns not only at home
but also abroad. [Rather than reinforcing pressure for protection,
pervasive crisis in the global economy is shown to generate
countervailing pressure for restraint in response to domestic
crisis]{.underline}. In some cases, **[hard times bring more, not less,
international cooperation]{.underline}**.

The final significant outcome addresses [a dog]{.underline} that
[hasn\'t barked]{.underline}: the effect of the Great Recession on
cross-border conflict and violence. [During the initial stages of the
crisis, multiple analysts asserted that the financial crisis would lead
states to increase their use of force]{.underline} as a tool for staying
in power.42 They voiced genuine concern that the global economic
downturn would lead to an increase in conflict---[whether
through]{.underline} greater internal [repression, diversionary wars,
arms races, or a ratcheting up of great power conflict]{.underline}.
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fueled impressions of a
surge in global public disorder. [**The aggregate data suggest
otherwise**, however]{.underline}. The Institute for Economics and Peace
has concluded that \"[the average level of peacefulness in 2012 is
approximately the same as it was in 2007]{.underline}.\"43 [Interstate
violence]{.underline} in particular [has declined since the start of the
financial crisis, as have **military expenditures**]{.underline} in most
sampled countries. Other [studies confirm that]{.underline} [the Great
Recession has not triggered any increase in violent
**conflict**]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and Peter Wallensteen
conclude: \"\[T\]he pattern is one of relative stability when we
consider the trend for the past five years.\"44 [The]{.underline}
secular [decline in violence that started with the end of the Cold War
has not been reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker observes that \"[the
crisis has not]{.underline} to date [generated the surge in
protectionist **nationalism** or ethnic exclusion that might have been
expected]{.underline}.\"43

#### No escalation of conflicts

Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be
dissolved if severe conflicts of interest were to arise. Could the more
peaceful world generate new interests that would bring the members of
the community into sharp disputes? 45 A zero-sum sense of status would
be one example, perhaps linked to a steep rise in nationalism. More
likely would be [a worsening of]{.underline} the [current economic
difficulties,]{.underline} which [could]{.underline} itself [produce
greater nationalism, undermine democracy and bring back old-fashioned
beggar-my-neighbor economic policies]{.underline}. [While these dangers
are real]{.underline}, **[it is hard to believe that the conflicts could
be great enough]{.underline}** [to lead]{.underline} the [members of the
community to contemplate fighting each other. It is not so much that
economic interdependence]{.underline} has proceeded to the point where
it [could not be reversed]{.underline} -- states that were more
internally interdependent than anything seen internationally have fought
bloody civil wars. [Rather it is that]{.underline} **[even if the more
extreme versions of free trade and economic liberalism become
discredited]{.underline}**, [it is]{.underline} [hard to see
how]{.underline} without building on a preexisting high level of
political conflict [leaders and mass opinion would come to believe that
their countries could prosper by impoverishing or]{.underline} even
[attacking others]{.underline}. Is it possible that problems will not
only become severe, but that people will entertain the thought that they
have to be solved by war? [While a pessimist could note that this
argument does not appear as outlandish as it did before the financial
crisis]{.underline}, [an optimist could reply (correctly]{.underline},
in my view) [that the very fact that we have seen]{.underline} **[such a
sharp economic down-turn]{.underline}** [without]{.underline}
**[anyone]{.underline}** [suggesting that force]{.underline} of arms [is
the solution]{.underline} [shows that]{.underline} **[even if bad times
bring about greater economic conflict]{.underline}**, **[it will not
make war thinkable]{.underline}**.

#### No Trump diversions from lashout

\"Global economy resilient to new political challenges,\"
https://sebgroup.com/press/news/global-economy-resilient-to-new-political-challenges

The interplay between economics and politics was undoubtedly a dominant
feature of analyses during 2016. As we know, [it was difficult to
foresee both election results and their economic consequences. It
was]{.underline} certainly [not strange that economists were unable
to]{.underline} predict the Brexit referendum outcome or [Donald Trump's
victory, when public opinion polling organisations and betting firms
failed to do so,]{.underline} but lessons might be learned from the
economic assessment impacts they made. [Economists]{.underline} probably
tend to [**exaggerate** the importance of more general political
phenomena. While in the midst of elections that appear historically
important, it is tempting to present **alarmist
projections**]{.underline} about election outcomes that seem improbable
and/or unpleasant. [But once the initial shock effect has faded, more
ordinary economic data such as corporate reports and macroeconomic
figures take the upper hand. Psychological effects often exaggerated One
important observation is that **it is difficult to find any historical
correlation between heightened security policy tensions and economic
activity**. Households and businesses do not seem]{.underline} to be
especially [sensitive in their consumption or capital spending
behaviour.]{.underline} This is perhaps because [uncertainty is offset
by investments in a defence build-up]{.underline}, for example. [Only
when the conditions that directly determine profitability and
investments are affected,]{.underline} for example via rising oil prices
or poorly functioning financial markets, [will the effects become clear.
Markets]{.underline} also seem to have a general tendency to [assume
that the economic policy makers can actually **behave rationally in
crisis situations**, until this has been disproved. Both during the US
sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 and the euro zone\'s existential
crisis a few years later, for a rather long time the market maintained
its faith that a response would come.]{.underline} Not until after a
lengthy period of inept actions by decision makers did these crises
become genuinely acute, with large secondary effects as a consequence.
[This market \"patience\" is presumably based on a long-time pattern of
recurring bailout measures by governments and central
banks,]{.underline} which usually benefit risk-taking at the expense of
caution or speculation that policy responses will not materialise. [It
is reasonable to assume that this may also underpin the rather cautious
reactions to the risks associated with the Trump administration\'s
agenda.]{.underline} Although one cannot complain about the
administration\'s power of initiative, [there is a fairly **high
probability** that **in important areas it will not go from words to
actions**. There may be \[for\] **various reasons** for this, such as
the inertia built into the **s**eparation **o**f **p**owers between the
White House, Congress and the court system, or expectations that
Trump\'s newly appointed cabinet secretaries and advisors will
eventually take their cues from more **established** US
positions.]{.underline}

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- Iran Prolif Inevitable 

#### Iran will get a bomb inevitably -- new sanctions will only make it worse

**Shapiro 19** (Jacob L. Shapiro, director of analysis for Geopolitical
Futures, master's degree from Oxford University, May 8, 2019. "Iran's
Inevitable Ultimatum."
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/irans-inevitable-ultimatum/)

**[Iran]{.underline}** [can **no longer afford**]{.underline} to be the
only country playing by [the JCPOA's rules]{.underline}. Rouhani's
decision to pursue the JCPOA was risky even with the attendant economic
benefits that were supposed to accompany it -- [maintaining]{.underline}
**[Iranian]{.underline}** [compliance with the]{.underline}
**[JCPOA]{.underline}** [without any of]{.underline} [those benefits
would be]{.underline} **[political suicide]{.underline}**. At this
point, Iran's last-ditch ultimatum is more about controlling the
country's global image than about changing the behavior of its
participants. Iran will at least be able to say that it kept its
promises until the bitter end, a point which may be useful in any future
negotiations into which it enters. For its part, the United States has
made it clear that sanctions are in the offing for any country that
engages with Iran economically, and for the JCPOA participants -- even
China, one of Iran's most important oil buyers -- interacting with Iran
is simply not worth the price of having the U.S. turn on them. (Saudi
Arabia has claimed that it will provide additional supply to Iran's
prior customers, and may have up to 2.0-2.5 million barrels per day of
spare capacity). No party to the JCPOA approves of what the U.S. is
doing, but none are strong enough to do anything to stop it, and none
has been willing to defy the U.S. by ensuring its survival.
**[Iran]{.underline}**, then, [has its **back against a
wall**]{.underline}, and the IRGC's argument -- [that a nuclear
deterrent is]{.underline} **[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
Iran's national [security]{.underline} -- appears increasingly more
valid. Even the Rouhani administration might harbor secret hopes that a
nuclear weapons program might generate the negotiating leverage
necessary to get the U.S. to deal with Iran on a more pragmatic basis.
The moment Iran entered into the JCPOA, it effectively lost its
negotiating leverage with the United States. Iran's nuclear weapons
program brought the U.S. government to the negotiating table once;
perhaps it will bring it to the table again. Considering Washington's
recent approach to North Korea -- namely, face-to-face negotiations
after North Korea started testing intercontinental ballistic missiles --
it is not an unreasonable tactic to attempt. For **[Iran]{.underline}**,
the bigger problem is that it [has]{.underline} **[no other tactics
left]{.underline}** to try. [The U.S. has broken agreements and applied
**new sanctions**]{.underline}, [and now it has deployed a carrier
strike group and a bomber task force to the
region](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/the-us-iran-and-a-new-american-deployment-1/).
[Iran has to **tip the balance**]{.underline} here somehow,
[and]{.underline} the threat of [resuming its nuclear weapons program is
**all it has**]{.underline}.

20-percent enrichment process at its Fordow nuclear facility. In 2015,
under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran was eligible
to enrich uranium only up to 3.7 percent for 15 years. But
**[Salehi]{.underline}** [announced]{.underline} [a concerning issue

2018, clearly stated, \"If we have to go back and withdraw from the
nuclear deal, we certainly will not go back to where we were before. We
will be standing on a much, much higher position.\" A new version of
nuclear fuel would be capable of enhancing the efficiency of the reactor
and Iran is also now capable of designing its own reactors that would
suit its own needs. [In September 2018, Ayatollah Ali
**Khamenei**]{.underline} had reportedly [ordered]{.underline} [to set
up and complete]{.underline} a very advanced hall for the [construction
of **modern centrifuges**]{.underline}. [Salehi\'s claim that Iran would
enrich uranium up to 20 percent is definitely a way for them to
**proceed further in their nuclear program**]{.underline}. In fact, in
August 2017 [Salehi declared that Iran could start enriching uranium up
to 20 percent within five days]{.underline} if it made a determined
effort to do so. Already [in June 2018]{.underline}, [**Iran** was
reported to have launched the **UF-6** (uranium hexafluoride)
**production facility** that was a step toward **increasing its uranium
enrichment capability**]{.underline}. **[UF-6]{.underline}** is the raw
material that is used to feed the centrifuges, which are used for
enriching uranium. [Possessing the ability to enrich uranium up to 20
percent would also **open ways** for Iran to enrich uranium that would
be **weapons grade**]{.underline}. [One of the pressing issues of the
post-nuclear deal period has been Iran\'s ongoing persistence on a
missile development program]{.underline}. Iran already possesses
sophisticated long-range ballistic and cruise missiles that are capable
of delivering nuclear warheads as well as chemical and biological
warheads and submunitions. [Allowing Tehran to enrich uranium up to 20
percent would only result in the country **furthering the capability**
of developing nuclear weapons]{.underline}. In fact, in June 2018,
[the]{.underline} **[Iranian government]{.underline}** had already
warned that it [would develop a **nuclear arsenal**]{.underline} [if the
deal fell apart]{.underline}. Not only this, [it would]{.underline} also
[start a new **nuclear arms race in the Middle East and North
Africa**]{.underline} region. Strategic repercussions Saudi Arabia wants
to possess nuclear technology for civil purposes but refuses to accept
the U.S. \"gold standard\" of restricting enrichment and spent fuel
reprocessing. Hence, a nuclear deal with the United States has been a
delayed process. [If]{.underline} **[Tehran]{.underline}** [reaches
the]{.underline} claimed [amount of]{.underline}
**[enrichment]{.underline}** for uranium, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**
would find it difficult to accept the U.S. gold standard. In addition,
countries in the region, especially **[Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Turkey]{.underline}**, [could also become
**high-risk nuclear power states.**]{.underline} The UAE accepts the
U.S. gold standard -- the 123 Agreement -- and refrains from enriching
uranium, but it has always been skeptical of the nuclear deal that
allowed Iran to enrich uranium up to 3.7 percent. The UAE ambassador to
Washington had also stated once that the UAE no longer felt bound by the
123 Agreement which was a bilateral agreement between the United States
and the UAE. Moreover, [enriching uranium for military purposes will be
against the nuclear deal and in the future, the United States might find
it difficult to persuade other states in the region to enter into such
similar nuclear deals should states in the Middle East go
nuclear.]{.underline} Though Iran has stated that it had no desire to
withdraw from the deal, **[any attempt]{.underline}** [to increase
enrichment]{.underline} [capacity]{.underline} [would **automatically**
lead to the nuclear deal]{.underline} [becoming **null and
void**]{.underline}. Iran in June 2018, also warned that it would resort
to an enrichment process on uranium, unless the European countries fail
to uphold the nuclear deal. Therefore, the enrichment program is seen as
a way to coerce Europe to stick to the nuclear deal by Iran. The uranium
enrichment program will only make the nuclear energy program in Iran
more complicated as there may not be any future scope to discuss
improvisation of the nuclear deal. In addition, [Iran will be supported
in its nuclear energy program by countries like China and
Russia,]{.underline} which makes Iran care less about the U.S. moving
away from the nuclear deal and despite the actions by U.S. President
Donald Trump, Iran would most likely go ahead with the uranium
enrichment program. Though Iran is a party to the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) and has the right to pursue a nuclear energy program[, its
ability to enrich uranium up to 20 percent may in future lead to a stage
where it **enriches uranium that is weapons grade**]{.underline}.
Another threat to anti-agreement countries is Iran having close ties
with Hezbollah -- an asymmetric militant group that has close ties with
Tehran. [**Iran** already transfers weapons and missile systems to
Hezbollah and hence, in the future, it could also **transfer nuclear
weapons or technological know-how to Hezbollah**]{.underline}.
**[Iran\'s nuclear program, if not checked, will only move ahead to
become a full-fledged nuclear program that can develop nuclear weapons
in a short span of time.]{.underline}**

[**Iran**'s]{.underline} [readiness to stick with the JCPOA so far may
give some]{.underline} in the Trump administration [the impression that
it can **continue indefinitely**]{.underline} [to have the best of both
worlds---Iranian nuclear restraint and U.S. freedom to apply maximum
pressure to compel Tehran to capitulate to its demands]{.underline}. But
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should not take continued Iranian compliance with the JCPOA for
**granted**]{.underline}. It has only been a few months since the
re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, and their full impact is still
uncertain. Before making a decision on whether to stay bound by the
JCPOA, the Iranians may be waiting a while longer to see whether the
efforts of the Europeans, Russians, Chinese, and others to circumvent
the U.S. sanctions, as well as Iran's own coping mechanisms, are
sufficient to make the impact of the U.S. pressure campaign tolerable.
An important benchmark will be May 2019, when the current exceptions to
oil sanctions are scheduled to expire. Depending on how the Trump
administration decides to proceed, the countries that received
exceptions in November 2018 may be able to obtain another exception with
only modest additional reductions in oil imports from Iran, or they may
be required to make drastic cuts or even go to zero in order to avoid
sanctions. Brian Hook, the administration's special envoy on Iran, told
Bloomberg in January 2019 that [the administration]{.underline} is "not
looking to grant new waivers" and [remains **committed**]{.underline}
[to get to **zero imports of Iranian crude**]{.underline}.53 The outcome
of the next round of exceptions, together with the effectiveness of
Iran's clandestine efforts to get its oil to market and the readiness of
countries such as China and Russia to defy U.S. sanctions threats, will
determine how much crude oil Iran will continue to sell. While Iran's
leaders may believe they can cope with **[oil sales]{.underline}** at
roughly 1 million barrels per day, **[reductions]{.underline}**
significantly beyond that level [would be]{.underline} much more
**[difficult to tolerate]{.underline}**. [Every barrel that is not sold
means]{.underline} **[less money]{.underline}** [available for
redistribution]{.underline} [programs intended to]{.underline} [protect
vulnerable populations and to]{.underline} **[quell political
unrest]{.underline}** at all population strata. [At some
point]{.underline}, though it is difficult to predict exactly when, [the
**economic pain**]{.underline} of sanctions [could become]{.underline}
**[so great]{.underline}** [that the argument in Tehran that JCPOA
compliance]{.underline} [is in Iran's **economic
interests**]{.underline} [would **no longer have
credibility**]{.underline}. [That point may now be]{.underline}
**[close]{.underline}**r than in the past. Iranian Supreme National
Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on January 7, 2019 that
"the Europeans' opportunity to execute their commitments to our country
under the JCPOA ... has ended."54 As one commentator put it, "[the high
ground does not pay the bills]{.underline}."55

But set aside for the moment all the logical inconsistencies and other
reasons to reject the notion of an Iranian regional marauder as a reason
to oppose the nuclear agreement. [Focus]{.underline} instead [on the
image of an Iran whose current regional policy supposedly is already an
assortment of destructive activities. This image has become]{.underline}
the kind of [conventional wisdom]{.underline} that repeatedly gets
invoked (even, in this instance, by supporters of the nuclear agreement)
[without any felt need]{.underline} by those who invoke it [to provide
any supporting facts or analysis because it is taken for
granted]{.underline} that everyone "knows" it to be true. [The
references to the image are almost always vague and general, couched in
terms of Iran supposedly "destabilizing" the Middle East or seeking to
"dominate" it or exercise "hegemony"]{.underline} over it, or that it is
"on the march" to take over the region. [Often there are references to
"terrorism" and "subversion" without anything more specific being
offered. Often the names of conflict-ridden countries in the region are
recited, but again without any specifics as to who is doing what in
those countries]{.underline}. To get away from such uselessly general
accusations, ask: (1) [what exactly is Iran doing in the Middle East
that is of concern; and]{.underline} (2) [how does what Iran is doing
differ from what other states are doing in the same places? **A careful
comparison of this sort leads to the conclusion that
Iran**]{.underline}, contrary to the conventional wisdom, [**does not
stand out in doing aggressive, destabilizing, or hegemonic things.**
Iran is one of the largest states]{.underline} in the Middle East [and
naturally]{.underline}, as with any such state, [competes for influence
in its region. To try to keep any such state]{.underline}, be it Iran or
any other, [from competing]{.underline} for such influence [would be
futile and damaging in its own right]{.underline}. [To label Iranian
policy as seeking "hegemony" or "domination" is only
that]{.underline}---i.e., [applying a label]{.underline}---when others
are using more forceful and destructive ways of trying to extend their
own influence in the same places. [Iran,]{.underline} unlike others,
[**has not launched wars** or **invaded neighboring
territory**]{.underline} (except in counterattacking during the war with
Iraq that Saddam Hussein started). [Nor has Iran drawn]{.underline},
China-like, [any nine-dash lines and asserted unsupported domination
over swaths of its own region.]{.underline} T[he assumption that just
about anything Iran does in the Middle East is contrary to U.S.
interests keeps getting made despite what should be the glaringly
obvious counterexample of the war in Iraq. Iran and the United States
are on the same side]{.underline} there. They both are supporting the
government of Iraq in trying to push back the radical group generally
known as ISIS. [Why should Iran's part of this effort be called part of
regional trouble-making, while the U.S. part of it is given some more
benign description]{.underline}? [Those in the United
States]{.underline} who would rather not face that counterexample
[are]{.underline} usually [quick to mutter something like, "Yes, but the
Iranians are doing this for their own malign purposes of spreading their
influence in Iraq]{.underline}." The first thing to note in response to
such muttering is that [if we are worried about increased Iranian
influence in Iraq, that increase is due chiefly not to anything the
Iranians have done but rather to a war of choice that the **U**nited
**S**tates initiated]{.underline}. The next thing is to ask on behalf of
what interests the Iranians would use their influence in Iraq, and how
that relates to U.S. interests. [The preeminent Iranian objective
regarding Iraq is to avoid anything resembling the incredibly costly
Iran-Iraq War, and to have a regime in Baghdad]{.underline}---preferably
friendly to Iran, but at least not hostile to it---[that would not
launch such a conflict again]{.underline}. **[Iran also does not want
endless instability]{.underline}** along its long western border, **[and
its leaders are smart enough to realize that narrowly prejudicial
sectarian politics are not a prescription for stability]{.underline}**.
[These lines of thinking are consistent with U.S.
interests]{.underline}; it is not only in the current fight against ISIS
that U.S. and Iranian interests converge. Look carefully also at another
conflict-ridden Middle Eastern state whose name often gets casually
invoked: Yemen. Iran and the United States are not on the same side of
this civil war, although [the United States probably has as much
explaining to do as to why it has taken]{.underline} the side it
has---[the same side as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the most
capable and threatening Al-Qaeda branch operating today---as Iran
does]{.underline}. [Iran has become identified with the]{.underline}
side of the rebellious [Houthi movement]{.underline}, although the most
prominent Yemeni leader on the same side as the Houthis is Ali Abdullah
Saleh, who as the Yemeni president for more than thirty years was seen
as our guy in Yemen, not the Iranians' guy. [Iran did not instigate the
Houthi rebellion, nor are the Houthis accurately described as "clients"
of Iran much less "proxies," as they often inaccurately
are.]{.underline} **[Instead Iran was probably a source of restraint in
advising the Houthis not to capture the capital of Sanaa]{.underline}**,
although the Houthis went ahead and did it anyway. The Iranians probably
are glad to see the Saudis bleed some in Yemen, and whatever aid Tehran
has given to the Houthis was given with that in mind. But [any such aid
pales in comparison to the extent and destructiveness of the Saudis'
intervention in Yemen,]{.underline} which has included aerial assaults
that have caused many hundreds of civilian casualties. In the same vein
consider Bahrain, which is an interesting case given historical Iranian
claims to Bahrain and past Iranian activity there. Despite that
background and despite Bahraini government accusations, there is an
absence of reliable evidence of anything in recent years that could
accurately be described as Iranian subversion in Bahrain. Instead it is
again the Saudis who have used forceful methods to exert their influence
on a neighbor, and in this case to prop up an unpopular Sunni regime in
a Shia majority country. The principal Saudi military intervention in
Bahrain came a few years ago, but it was an early shot in a campaign
that has taken fuller shape under King Salman [to use any available
means, including military force, to expand Saudi influence in the
region](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/world/middleeast/king-salman-upends-status-quo-in-region-and-the-royal-family.html?_r=0).
If there is a Persian Gulf power that has been using damaging methods to
try to become a regional hegemon, it is Saudi Arabia, not Iran. The
Saudis could claim to be acting on behalf of a status quo in Bahrain and
Yemen, but then what about Syria, where it is Iran that is backing the
existing regime? And as perhaps the most germane question, [how can any
one of the outside players that have mucked into that incredibly
complicated civil war be singled out as a destabilizing regional
marauder while the others]{.underline} (some of whom, such as the United
States and Israel, have conducted their own airstrikes in the country)
[be given the benefit of more benign labeling? Iran did not start the
Syrian war.]{.underline} [And each of the most significant
sides]{.underline} fighting that war [are dominated by]{.underline} what
we normally would consider [certifiable bad guys]{.underline}: the Assad
regime, ISIS, and an Islamist coalition led by the local Al-Qaeda
branch[. It is hard to see a clear and convincing basis for parceling
out benign and malign labeling here when it comes to the outside
players]{.underline}. [Then of course there is the rest of the Levantine
part of the region]{.underline}, including Palestine; the aid
relationships that Iran has had with the H groups---Hezbollah and
Hamas---are continually invoked in any litany of Iranian regional
activity. Lebanese Hezbollah certainly is still an important ally of
Iran, although it has long since become strong enough to outgrow any
Iranian hand-holding. We should never forget that prior to 9/11
Hezbollah was the group that had more U.S. blood on its hands through
terrorism than any other group. We also should understand that Hezbollah
has become a major player in Lebanese politics in a way in which many in
the region, including its immediate political opponents, accept it as a
legitimate political actor. Right now as a military actor it is deeply
involved in the effort to support the Syrian regime, and it is not
looking to stir up any new wars or instability anywhere else. Hamas has
never been anything remotely resembling a proxy of Iran, although it has
accepted, somewhat reluctantly, Iranian aid in the absence of other
help. To Iran, Hamas represents Palestinian resistance to Israeli
occupation of (or blockading and subjugation of) Palestinian territory,
without being an accessory to that occupation, which is how the
Palestinian Authority is widely seen. Hamas is the winner of the last
free Palestinian election, and it has repeatedly made clear that its
ambition is to hold political power among Palestinians and that it is
willing to maintain a long-term truce with Israel. Right now Hamas is
trying, unfortunately with only partial success, to keep small groups
from overturning the current cease-fire with rocket firings into Israel.
Again, [none of this is a conflict that Iran has instigated or that Iran
is stirring up or escalating. Iran is not the cause of the instability
that already reigns]{.underline}. And the broader opposition to
continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is opposition that
Iran shares with many others, including the whole Arab world. As long as
we are looking at this part of the region, [it is impossible to escape
notice that Iran does not hold a candle to Israel when it comes to
forcefully throwing weight around in the neighborhood in damaging and
destabilizing ways, even without]{.underline} considering the
[occupation of the West Bank]{.underline}. This has included multiple
armed invasions of neighboring territory as well as other actions, such
as the attack on Iraq years ago that stimulated Iraq to speed up its
program to develop nuclear weapons. And before we leave the Middle East
as a whole, [it also is impossible to escape notice that the single most
destabilizing action in the region over the past couple of decades was
the U.S. launch of a war of aggression in Iraq]{.underline} in 2003.
Iran certainly has done nothing like that. [The ritualistically repeated
notion that Iran is wreaking instability all over the region **is a
badly mistaken myth**]{.underline}. There are important respects in
which Iranian policies and actions do offend U.S. interests, but
p[rotection of those interests is not helped by perpetuating myths.
Perpetuation of this particular myth has several deleterious
effects]{.underline}. The most immediate and obvious one is to corrupt
debate over the nuclear deal. Another is [to foster broader
misunderstanding about Iranian behavior and intentions that threatens to
corrupt debate over other issues as well. Yet another consequence
involves a failure to understand fully that every state competes for
influence. Such efforts to compete are called *foreign
policy*]{.underline}. It would be in our own interests for other states
to wage that competition through peaceful and legitimate means. [By
misrepresenting who is doing what]{.underline}, and through what means,
in the Middle East today, [the myth about Iranian behavior maintains a
constituency for isolating and ostracizing Iran---**which makes it
less**, not more, **likely that Iran**, so ostracized, **will use
peaceful and legitimate means to pursue its interests in the
future.**]{.underline}

#### Nuclear proliferation solves Middle East instability 

**Waltz 12** (Kenneth, Senior Research Scholar at the Saltzman Institute
of War and Peace Studies and Adjunct Professor of Political Science at
Columbia University, \"Why Iran should get the bomb,\" July,
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2012/07/20/kenneth-waltz-why-iran-should-get-the-bomb)

The third possible outcome is that Iran continues its current course and
publicly goes nuclear by testing a weapon. U.S. and Israeli officials
have declared that outcome unacceptable, arguing that a nuclear Iran is
a uniquely terrifying prospect, even an existential threat. Such
language is typical of major powers, which have historically gotten
riled up whenever another country has begun to develop a nuclear weapon
of its own. Yet so far, every time another country has managed to
shoulder its way into the nuclear club, the other members have always
changed tack and decided to live with it. In fact, **[by reducing
imbalances in military power, new nuclear states generally produce more
regional and international stability, not less.]{.underline}** [Israel's
regional nuclear monopoly]{.underline}, which has proved remarkably
durable for the past four decades, **[has long fueled instability in the
Middle East]{.underline}**. In no other region of the world does a lone,
unchecked nuclear state exist. It [is Israel's nuclear arsenal, not
Iran's desire for one, that has **contributed most** to the current
crisis]{.underline}. Power, after all, begs to be balanced. What is
surprising about the Israeli case is that it has taken so long for a
potential balancer to emerge. Of course, it is easy to understand why
Israel wants to remain the sole nuclear power in the region and why it
is willing to use force to secure that status. In 1981, Israel bombed
Iraq to prevent a challenge to its nuclear monopoly. It did the same to
Syria in 2007 and is now considering similar action against Iran. But
[the very acts that have allowed Israel to maintain its nuclear edge in
the short term have prolonged an imbalance that is unsustainable in the
long term]{.underline}. Israel's proven ability to strike potential
nuclear rivals with impunity has inevitably made its enemies eager to
develop the means to prevent Israel from doing so again. In this way,
[the current tensions are best viewed not as the early stages of a
relatively recent Iranian nuclear crisis but rather as the final stages
of a decades-long Middle East nuclear crisis **that will end only when a
balance of military power is restored.**]{.underline} One reason the
danger of a nuclear Iran has been grossly exaggerated is that the debate
surrounding it has been distorted by misplaced worries and fundamental
misunderstandings of how states generally behave in the international
system. The first prominent concern, which undergirds many others, is
that the Iranian regime is innately irrational. Despite a widespread
belief to the contrary, [Iranian policy is made not by "mad mullahs" but
by perfectly sane ayatollahs who want to survive]{.underline} just like
any other leaders. Although [Iran's leaders]{.underline} indulge in
inflammatory and hateful rhetoric, they [show no propensity for
self-destruction]{.underline}. It would be a grave error for
policymakers in the United States and Israel to assume otherwise. Yet
that is precisely what many U.S. and Israeli officials and analysts have
done. Portraying Iran as irrational has allowed them to argue that the
logic of nuclear deterrence does not apply to the Islamic Republic. If
Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, they warn, it would not hesitate to use
it in a first strike against Israel, even though doing so would invite
massive retaliation and risk destroying everything the Iranian regime
holds dear. Although it is impossible to be certain of Iranian
intentions, [it is far more likely that if Iran desires nuclear weapons,
it is for the purpose of providing for its own security, not to improve
its offensive capabilities]{.underline} (or destroy itself). Iran may be
intransigent at the negotiating table and defiant in the face of
sanctions, but it still acts to secure its own preservation.
Nevertheless, even some [observers and policymakers who accept that the
Iranian regime is rational still worry that a nuclear weapon would
embolden it, providing Tehran with a shield that would allow it to act
more aggressively and increase its support for terrorism. The problem
with these concerns is that they **contradict the record of every other
nuclear weapons state going back to 1945**]{.underline}. History shows
that when countries acquire the bomb, they feel increasingly vulnerable
and become acutely aware that their nuclear weapons make them a
potential target in the eyes of major powers. This awareness discourages
nuclear states from bold and aggressive action. [Maoist China, for
example, became much less bellicose after acquiring nuclear weapons in
1964, and India and Pakistan have both become more cautious since going
nuclear. There is little reason to believe Iran would break this
mold.]{.underline} Another oft-touted worry is that if Iran obtains the
bomb, other states in the region will follow suit, leading to a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East. But [the nuclear age is now almost 70
years old, and so far, fears of proliferation have proved to be
unfounded.]{.underline} Properly defined, the term "proliferation" means
a rapid and uncontrolled spread. Nothing like that has occurred; in
fact, since 1970, there has been a marked slowdown in the emergence of
nuclear states. [There is no reason to expect that this pattern will
change now. Should Iran become the second Middle Eastern nuclear
power]{.underline} since 1945, **[it would hardly signal the start of a
landslide]{.underline}**. When Israel acquired the bomb [in the
1960s]{.underline}, it was at war with many of its neighbors. Its
nuclear arms were a much bigger threat to the Arab world than Iran's
program is today. [If an atomic Israel did not trigger an arms
race]{.underline} then, **[there is no reason a nuclear Iran should
now.]{.underline}** In 1991, historical rivals [India and
Pakistan]{.underline} signed a treaty agreeing not to target each
other's nuclear facilities. They realized that far more worrisome than
their adversary's nuclear deterrent was the instability produced by
challenges to it. Since then, [even in the face of high tensions and
risky provocations]{.underline}, the two countries **[have kept the
peace]{.underline}**. Israel and Iran would do well to consider this
precedent. **[If Iran goes nuclear, Israel and Iran will deter each
other, as nuclear powers always have]{.underline}**. **[There has never
been a full-scale war between two nuclear-armed states.]{.underline}**
Once Iran crosses the nuclear threshold, deterrence will apply, even if
the Iranian arsenal is relatively small. [No other country in the region
will have an incentive to acquire its own nuclear capability, and the
current crisis will finally dissipate, **leading to a Middle East that
is more stable than it is today**.]{.underline} For that reason, the
United States and its allies need not take such pains to prevent the
Iranians from developing a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy between Iran and
the major powers should continue, because open lines of communication
will make the Western countries feel better able to live with a nuclear
Iran. But the current sanctions on Iran can be dropped: They primarily
harm ordinary Iranians, with little purpose. Most important,
policymakers and citizens in the Arab world, Europe, Israel and the
United States should take comfort from the fact that **[history has
shown that where nuclear capabilities emerge, so, too, does
stability]{.underline}**. **[When it comes to nuclear weapons, now as
ever, more may be better]{.underline}**.

### 1AR Saudi Oil DA -- Iran Defense 

#### Iran nuclearization deters US/Israeli attacks AND won't embolden Iran aggression

**Beardsley 12** (Kyle, Assistant Professor of Political Science at
Emory University, \"What Will Iran Do If It Gets a Nuclear Bomb?,\"
2/22,
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/what-will-iran-do-if-it-gets-a-nuclear-bomb/253430/)

A nuclear-armed Iran is not likely to act much differently. Most
importantly, **[Iran will have no incentive to use its nuclear weapons
in aggression]{.underline}**; doing so against Israeli or American
targets would gain Iran little and cost it much. [On a more practical
level, an Iranian bomb also will not substantially change the general
strategic dynamics]{.underline}. In a series of articles, Victor Asal
and I have shown that [states with nuclear weapons tend to face less
hostility from opponents, be in shorter crises, and prevail more often
in their crises against non-nuclear states. The logic is that nuclear
weapons are **an effective deterrent that temper
aggression**]{.underline}. According to this logic, [the main benefit to
Iran of acquiring nuclear weapons is to **deter military threats by its
primary adversaries**]{.underline}, Israel and the United States. Given
that Iran already has a strong deterrent\--via its importance to
hydrocarbon supplies, robust conventional forces, ability to disrupt
fragile situations in Lebanon and Iraq, and Western war weariness\--it
is doubtful that Iran will notice much immediate advantage from
obtaining nuclear weapons. [Its main incentive for proliferating
apparently is to lock in the regime\'s security in the long
run]{.underline}. Victor Asal and I also find that [proliferators are
sources of instability prior to attaining weapons]{.underline}, **[so a
modest upside to successful proliferation would be movement away from
the current alarming exchanges]{.underline}**.

#### Iranian aggression from proliferation is all rhetoric---leaders have incentive to hold back nuclear power

**Samuel 12** (Annie Tracy, Research Fellow in the International
Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy\'s School\'s Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs, \"What Will Iran Do If It Gets a
Nuclear Bomb?\", Feb 22,
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/what-will-iran-do-if-it-gets-a-nuclear-bomb/253430/)

Iran\'s possession of a nuclear weapon would be a troubling and
disturbing development, especially for the future of the
nonproliferation regime and for stability in the Middle East. However,
[there is reason to believe that Iran\'s theoretical possession of a
nuclear weapon would not profoundly alter the essence of its foreign
policy. Iran\'s foreign policy,]{.underline} both [before and after the
1979 revolution, has been]{.underline} largely [pragmatic,]{.underline}
particularly [in action if not always in rhetoric.]{.underline} Though
it has miscalculated the effects of and reactions to its policies, as
well as adopted violence as a tool to achieve its strategic goals,
[Iran\'s policies have generally been conceived with rational security
objectives in mind. The hypothetical development of a nuclear
weapons]{.underline} capability [would not]{.underline} fundamentally
[alter Iran\'s overriding foreign policy objective\--regime
security.]{.underline} [Iran\'s leaders,]{.underline} like those in
other states, [want to remain in power. They want the regime in which
they have invested and which serves their interests to endure. Foreign
policy, in addition to safeguarding Iran\'s borders and national
integrity, is a means for safeguarding the regime.]{.underline}
Possession of a nuclear weapon will likely make Iran more impervious to
attack and may make Iran bolder in its support for armed groups.
However, possessing a nuclear weapon will is not likely to alter Iran\'s
paramount foreign policy goals of national and regime security. Further,
[possession of a nuclear weapon is likely to cause Iran\'s isolation
from the international community,]{.underline} an outcome Iran does not
want. [Iran would]{.underline} therefore [be likely to use any
advantages of possessing a nuclear weapon in a way that would not
significantly increase its international isolation even
further.]{.underline} The Islamic Republic is not an irrational or
suicidal regime. A nuclear weapon will not make it one.

[A nuclear-armed Iran is not likely to act much
differently.]{.underline} Most importantly, [Iran will have no incentive
to use its nuclear weapons in aggression; doing so against Israeli or
American targets would gain Iran little and cost it much.]{.underline}
On a more practical level, an Iranian bomb also will not substantially
change the general strategic dynamics. In a series of articles, Victor
Asal and I have shown that [states with nuclear weapons tend to face
less hostility from opponents, be in shorter crises, and prevail more
often in their crises against non-nuclear states.]{.underline} [The
logic is that nuclear weapons are an effective deterrent that temper
aggression.]{.underline} According to this logic, [the main benefit to
Iran of acquiring nuclear weapons is to deter military threats by its
primary adversaries, Israel and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [Given that Iran already has a strong
deterrent\--via its importance to hydrocarbon supplies, robust
conventional forces, ability to disrupt fragile situations in Lebanon
and Iraq, and Western war weariness\--it is doubtful that Iran will
notice much immediate advantage from obtaining nuclear weapons. Its main
incentive]{.underline} for proliferating apparently [is]{.underline} to
lock in the regime\'s [security in the long run.]{.underline} Victor
Asal and I also find that proliferators are sources of instability prior
to attaining weapons, so a modest upside to successful proliferation
would be movement away from the current alarming exchanges.

## Aff Rate Hikes Scenario 

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- Rate Hikes Now 

#### Rate hikes are coming now -- tariffs and wage increases will drive inflation 

**La Monica 19** (Paul R. La Monica, writer for CNN Business, citing
investment experts and seniors economists, May 31, 2019. "The reason why
the Fed could be pressured to raise rates."
https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/investing/fed-rate-hikes-inflation/index.html)

New York (CNN Business) The tariff-induced market meltdown is increasing
the probability that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later
this year. But what if the central bank goes in a different direction?
There\'s an argument that [the **Fed**]{.underline}\'s hands are tied
and that it [might need to]{.underline} actually **[hike
rates]{.underline}** [if consumer prices **creep higher**]{.underline}.
[The Fed]{.underline} may not just be facing the risk of recession. It
[needs to watch out for]{.underline} another threat: a troublesome
economic trend known as **[stagflation]{.underline}**, [which is when
[sluggish
growth](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html)
and inflation happen simultaneously]{.underline}. That\'s what happened
in the 1970s, when oil prices surged at the same time the broader
economy was slumping. \"**[It\'s entirely possible the Fed could have to
raise rates]{.underline}**,\" said Michael DePalma, managing director of
fixed income with MacKay Shields, a firm that runs the High
Yield([HYLD](https://money.cnn.com/quote/etf/etf.html?symb=HYLD&source=story_quote_link))
bond ETF. \"What\'s tricky is that inflation is a process. It doesn\'t
turn on a dime. It has to work its way through,\" DePalma added. \"If
you do get inflation it can seriously hamper the Fed\'s ability to cut
rates if the economy slows.\" Retailers are raising prices Make no
mistake: **[Tariffs]{.underline}** [imposed on China and
Mexico]{.underline} [should lead to **higher prices**]{.underline} at US
retailers [and]{.underline} car dealerships. Costco
([COST](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=COST&source=story_quote_link))
chief financial officer Richard Galanti was pretty blunt when asked
about the impact of the trade war on the company\'s earnings conference
call Thursday evening. \"At the end of the day, [prices will go up on
things]{.underline},\" Galanti said. Keep in mind that Costco is a
retail powerhouse that has the financial wherewithal to absorb the hit
from higher costs better than many other chains. It\'s also a company
that prides itself on offering bargains. So if Costco might have to
raise prices, expect just about every other retailer, large and small,
to do the same. Lewis Alexander, chief US economist at Nomura, said in a
report that he\'s expecting a \"pronounced impact on auto prices and
some electronics\" because of tariffs. He argues that food prices could
go up, too. \"Higher tariffs on imports from Mexico and China could
provide an opportunity for price-setters to raise prices, which could
make long-term inflation expectations unstable,\" Alexander added. \"In
that case, [shocks induced by tariffs might have a **long-lasting impact
on inflation**]{.underline}.\" [Inflation risk is
**\'underappreciated\'**]{.underline} [A lot of people are also too
quick to dismiss inflation as a concern]{.underline}, said Alejandra
Grindal, senior international economist with Ned Davis Research. She
noted that in addition to the possibility of higher consumer prices from
tariffs, the healthy job market in the United States has led to higher
wages. [A **continued rise**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the size of
[workers\' paychecks will **add to inflation pressures**]{.underline}.
\"I\'m not saying the Fed will definitely raise rates. But it\'s a risk
that\'s underappreciated since tariffs and [higher wages could lead to a
spike in inflation]{.underline},\" Grindal said. Still, unless the
pendulum swings dramatically toward a recession or a substantial pickup
in inflation, the Fed may have no choice but to sit tight and wait to
see how the trade war ultimately pans out. \"It\'s hard to see
stagflation coming, but you could see consumer prices accelerate at the
same time the economy slows down,\" said Brian Nick, chief investment
strategist with Nuveen. \"That\'s why I don\'t think the Fed steps in
either way.\" The Fed also has to worry more about a prolonged economic
slump because of tariffs than the risk of higher prices, said Mona
Mahajan, US investment strategist and portfolio manager with Allianz
Global Investors. \"The case for cutting rates has escalated. There is
substantial downside for the US economy,\" Mahajan said, adding that the
Fed may be willing to let inflation overshoot a bit in order to avoid a
sharp economic slowdown. Either way, the Fed is in a bind right now.
There are no easy answers about what it should do next.

whether Trump abstains from launching a separate trade war against the
European auto industry, which would rattle equity markets again. Yet,
barring more fights over the US federal budget and the debt ceiling --
not to mention possible impeachment proceedings against Trump -- the US
could be spared serious domestic political and policy shocks in the
months ahead. If US GDP growth does remain resilient this year, some
acceleration of wage growth and price inflation could follow, and
**[core inflation]{.underline}** [may]{.underline} even **[rise above

allow]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} to become the new status quo.
[Should this]{.underline} scenario [arise]{.underline} later in the
year, or next year, [the Fed could **raise its baseline
rate**]{.underline} by another 25 basis points before settling into a
protracted pause. Either way, the new normal will be a US policy rate
close to or just below 3%.

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- UQ Overwhelms 

#### High levels of inflation are inevitable, but no rate hikes -- the Fed knows it would bankrupt us and there's no political will

**Harris 18** (Richard Harris, January 24, 2018. "Inflation is back but
not interest rates."
https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2130254/inflation-back-not-interest-rates)

How short memories are -- even the central banks have forgotten the
1980s when inflation was Public Enemy No 1. Since then [inflation has
had **more comebacks than Frank Sinatra**]{.underline} -- but is still
mysteriously subdued. Is this the year when it rears its ugly head?
Post-war politicians and economists were consumed by worry that
inflation would destroy their paper money. The greenback was backed by
gold and the German Bundesbank ruled its money with an iron hand as its
leaders remembered the wealth of two generations before them had been
destroyed by hyperinflation. The sheer horror of the memory of their
family's hard-earned cash melting away in the heat of rampant inflation,
as confidence in paper money was lost, kept monetary authorities
responsible for two or more generations. The new generation is unable to
comprehend the dangers. Certainly, the ravages of inflation have been
recently seen in countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, but those
nations, rich in mineral wealth, were bankrupted by their incompetent
politicians who printed money. Surely you can't compare us to them? In
the 1980s, [policymakers realised that they could defeat inflation by
keeping money expensive through high interest rates -- as high as it
took]{.underline}. My mortgage rate rose to almost 20 per cent per year,
fine if I kept my job but if I had fallen off the roller coaster, I was
in trouble. Since then, thanks to the occasional recession, stubbornly
high unemployment, stubbornly low pay rises, and milky economic growth,
inflation has steadily fallen. Rising productivity (also poorly
measured) from workers being replaced by machines, and the emergence of
China as the world's low cost manufacturing centre also helped.
**[Policymakers]{.underline}** [figured]{.underline} that in order to
move away from boom and bust cycles that had plagued economies roughly
every seven years, [they would **lower interest rates**]{.underline}
every time there was a bust. [The problem is that they **have not had
the guts to raise them again**]{.underline} -- [so we remain in a world
of easy money and **ripe conditions** for **sudden
inflation**]{.underline}. The magical element of why inflation has
remained low for so long is probably rooted in it being a behavioural
concept. Prices go up because people think prices are going to go up.
There is no increase in productivity for that extra value. Inflation
rises faster if the masses have easy access to easy (meaning cheap and
plentiful) money. Inflation is a valueless increase in prices. Yet
central bankers know that one attribute of inflation is that it can also
reduce the value of debt -- especially when there is too much debt in
the system. So in the last few years, they have clamoured for a little
inflation; not too much, maybe 2 per cent. Just enough to erode some
debt and to prove that economic growth was just around the corner. It
was always a fallacious argument, for inflation is a resultant of
economic growth not a cause. It is when inflation becomes a cause that
it becomes very dangerous because Joe Public will then factor it into
his daily life. This is why official inflation figures are suspiciously
low. In Hong Kong, we are soothed by the amazingly low sub-2 per cent
per annum official figure, even though most of us would guess it was
nearer double digits. We can see that inflation is rising just by
looking at the indicators in the back of The Economist. [The US at the
end of 2016 had zero inflation, yet by the end of 2017 it was 2.1 per
cent]{.underline} per annum. The Eurozone was 0.3 per cent rising to 1.1
per cent. Even inflation-free Japan saw a rise from minus 0.2 to 0.5 per
cent per annum. This comeback, [the rise in inflation looks
**permanent**]{.underline}. But [just like it is **hard to be a little
bit pregnant**]{.underline}, [it is **hard** for inflation to **just
rise** 1 or 2 per cent]{.underline}. The behavioural aspects associated
with inflation means that [workers will clamour for]{.underline}
[more]{.underline}, [which means **higher prices**]{.underline}, [and
the **vicious cycle** turns **aggressively**]{.underline}. How will
[policymakers]{.underline} handle it when strikes and pay rises are the
meat of the nightly news? They [are]{.underline} now **[realistically
unable to drive up interest rates to curb inflation]{.underline}** --
[for governments from the US to Europe to China to Japan are the biggest
debtors themselves]{.underline}. [Central bankers will]{.underline}
[**not bankrupt** their governments]{.underline}. So we may find
ourselves in a world where inflation rises almost unfettered. Such is
the danger of paper money. And bitcoin won't come to the rescue -- that
has nobody backing it!

#### Rate hikes are good for growth

rate hike". September 18, 2017.
<http://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/7-surprising-benefits-of-higher-interest-rates-from-the-federal-reserve/#slide=1>)

**[7 benefits of Fed rate hike]{.underline}** Interest rates are going
up. The Federal Reserve hiked rates once in 2015, once again last year
and twice in 2017. While a rate hike isn't expected this Wednesday, the
Fed has predicted it will raise rates one more time this year. Sure, the
increases mean it will cost more to borrow. But you'll benefit from
getting better rates on high-yield certificates of deposit. Healthier
returns on CDs are only one gain from the Fed's rate-raising campaign.
Here's how you can take advantage of other positive outcomes from Fed
rate increases. **[Higher returns for savers]{.underline}** If you're a
saver, low interest rates have brought about the financial equivalent of
a long drought. [Any improvement, even modest, is **welcome** and
**overdue**]{.underline}. When savings rates increase, put your money in
an interest-bearing account. "[Rising interest rates would benefit
elderly Americans on fixed incomes and others who rely on
interest]{.underline} income [to help cover their living
expenses]{.underline}," says Alan MacEachin, corporate economist with
Navy Federal Credit Union. **[Tamed inflation]{.underline}** Most
broad-based measures of prices have indicated inflation has been a
virtual no-show in the U.S. in recent years. The central bank's target
for inflation is 2 percent, but it has been falling short of that goal.
If the Fed achieves its objectives in steering the economy, inflation
should remain under control. [A positive inflation scenario]{.underline}
after a rate increase [might include]{.underline} "**[lower prices of
imported consumer goods]{.underline}**, due to a likely higher exchange
value of the dollar if our domestic rate increases are not matched by
policy tightening in other major economies," says Daniil Manaenkov,
assistant research scientist at the Research Seminar in Quantitative
Economics at the University of Michigan. [**More lending** A credit
bubble rightfully received some of the blame for the financial crisis of
the past decade]{.underline}. [In the aftermath, lending came to a
complete stop.]{.underline} Lending has resumed. "[Banks may have a
**greater incentive** to loan out reserves at **higher interest rates**,
and the increased flow of additional credit would **boost economic
growth**,]{.underline}" says Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for
Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. Low-rate
credit cards are still available, but availability will dwindle as
interest rates rise. [**More interest income for retirees** As a rate
boost brings better returns to savings vehicles]{.underline}, [senior
citizens should enjoy better paydays by putting their money in CDs and
savings accounts]{.underline}. "Higher interest rates on CDs and other
financial instruments will particularly help older Americans trying to
live on their retirement savings," says Lynn Reaser, chief economist at
Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. As the population ages in
coming years, many more Americans will come to appreciate even modest
increases in interest income during retirement when they buy
certificates of deposit. [**Stronger dollar helping US travelers**
Everybody loves a bargain, right? A strong U.S. dollar has meant
significant savings for Americans heading abroad because it gives U.S.
travelers more buying power.]{.underline} Predicting moves in the
foreign exchange market is difficult, but Snaith and other economists
say the dollar could strengthen further as the Fed boosts rates. [Fed
tightening "is likely to mean a somewhat higher dollar,]{.underline} so
people traveling to Europe will do well," says Dean Baker, co-director
of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. If you're
traveling this fall, shop the best airline and travel credit cards.
[**Stocks will trade on fundamentals** As the Federal Reserve embarks on
what officials have called "normalization]{.underline}" (that is, a
backing away from record-low rates), [stock prices may start to make
more sense]{.underline} and not reflect the central bank's easy monetary
policy quite so much. ["A normalization of rates would return the focus
to market fundamentals and off of focusing on the nuances of each Fed
statement]{.underline}," says David Nice, former senior economist at DS
Economics in Chicago. [**Would-be homebuyers may get off the fence** As
the Fed continues to raise rates, higher mortgage rates will follow. If
the prospect of higher mortgage rates compels you to a home sooner than
later]{.underline}, you won't be alone. "[Higher mortgage rates could
push buyers off the fence --- **increasing demand, increasing prices and
increasing home equity** so that more people can sell their
homes]{.underline}," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic
Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

#### Rate hikes to calm inflation won't kill economic growth -- it has a neutral fiscal impact 

**Kling 16** (Arnold, Mercatus Center, \"What Would Change Interest
Rates?\", Senior Affiliated Scholar,
https://www.mercatus.org/publications/what-would-change-interest-rates)

However, [**interest rates do not go up for no reason**.
The]{.underline} fiscal [effect of an interest rate change depends on
the source for that change. The source could be an increase in real
economic growth, an increase in inflation, or an increase in the risk
premium]{.underline} that investors assign to government securities.
This essay addresses each of those possibilities.¶ An Increase in Real
Economic Growth¶ [Any increase in real economic growth would likely be
caused by an increase in the return to capital]{.underline}. As the
return to capital rises, investment increases, and this change raises
interest rates. [**A surge in real economic growth would be favorable
for the fiscal outlook**; interest expense as a percentage of GDP would
rise, but GDP itself would also increase. This increase is particularly
significant for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[where]{.underline} the current outstanding [debt is dwarfed
by]{.underline} the [unfunded]{.underline} future liabilities [embedded
in]{.underline} Social Security and [Medicare. A faster growth rate
would produce a higher tax base for meeting such
liabilities]{.underline} as they come due.¶ An Increase in Inflation¶
[Because interest rates tend to rise along with increased expectations
of inflation, consumers and businesses face a choice]{.underline}
between making purchases now or postponing purchases into the future. If
they expect prices to rise rapidly, their incentive is to make purchases
sooner rather than later. This move increases the demand for borrowing
and lowers the supply of saving, until interest rates have gone up
sufficiently to balance demand and supply.¶ One standard theory, often
attributed to Irving Fisher, is that every percentage point increase in
expected inflation is accompanied by an equal increase in nominal
interest rates, leaving the real interest rate constant. Expectations of
inflation closely align with actual inflation experience. Thus, we
should think in terms of a scenario in which both actual and expected
inflation rise by a given amount.¶ **[A rise in interest rates caused by
an increase in inflation would have little effect on the US fiscal
position]{.underline}**. However, it is true that at the point of
inflation increase, there will be an effect on any past long-term debt
securities that were issued when inflation expectations were lower. [The
result is that nominal GDP goes up]{.underline}, and---as a percentage
of nominal GDP---the interest expense on this legacy long-term debt goes
down.¶ The fiscal benefits of a jump in inflation are attenuated by
several important considerations. Some of the US Treasury's gain from
unexpected inflation would be offset by losses at the Fed because the
Fed uses short-term funds to back its holdings of long-term securities.¶
Moreover, the unfunded future liabilities that are embedded in
entitlement programs would tend to go up with inflation. Social Security
benefits are indexed to inflation, which means that as inflation rises,
the unfunded liabilities of the Social Security system rise as well.
Remember that as inflation increases, the prices of healthcare services
are likely to increase. This change will raise expenditures in Medicare,
the other major program with unfunded liabilities.¶ Overall, to a first
approximation, [a **rise in interest rates** resulting from an
**increase in inflation** would be **neutral** with respect to the
**fiscal outlook**]{.underline}. If the fiscal outlook improves at all,
it will be by much less than would be the case with higher real economic
growth.¶ An Increase in the Risk Premium¶ Another scenario in which
interest rates could rise would be an increase in the risk premium for
government debt. Such an increase would likely be sudden and unexpected.
It might be caused, for example, by a crisis in another country, such as
Japan, with a high debt ratio. Such a crisis might lead to talk of
default or debt restructuring, which, in turn, could lead investors to
reduce their holding of sovereign debt in any country with an
unsustainable fiscal path, including the United States.¶ A rise in
interest rates resulting from an increase in the risk premium would
cause interest expense to go up without any compensating increase in
GDP. Thus, the rise would be a pure negative for the fiscal outlook.
Moreover, it could trigger a vicious cycle: a rise in the risk premium
could darken the fiscal outlook, which could cause a further rise in the
risk premium, thereby leading to a worse fiscal outlook, and so forth.¶
In an earlier paper, I argued that this sort of vicious cycle could play
out so rapidly that it would represent a "regime shift" from a state of
high confidence to a state of low confidence. As a result, the United
States would suddenly find itself deep in a fiscal crisis.¶ Conclusion¶
**[The fiscal effect of a rise in interest rates would depend on the
source of the increase. Higher returns to investment and higher real GDP
growth would be favorable to the fiscal outlook]{.underline}**, **[but a
higher inflation rate would be]{.underline}** essentially
**[neutral]{.underline}** to the fiscal outlook. An increase in the risk
premium on government debt could be devastating to the fiscal outlook.

#### No US-China war-accidental escalation unlikely because of relative stability, economic interdependence, and MAD

University of Indiana, Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of

Tensions Are Unlikely to Lead to War,\"

Graham Allison\'s April 12 article, "How America and China Could Stumble
to War," explores how misperceptions and bureaucratic dysfunction could
accelerate a militarized crisis involving the United States and China
into an unwanted war. However, the article fails to persuade because it
neglects the key political and geostrategic conditions that make war
plausible in the first place. Without those conditions in place, the
risk that a crisis could accidentally escalate into war becomes far
lower. [The U.S.-China relationship today may be trending towards
greater tension, but the **relative stability**]{.underline} [and
overall low level of hostility make the prospect of an accidental
escalation to war **extremely unlikely**.]{.underline}

[In a series of scenarios centered around the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea]{.underline}, [Taiwan and the **E**ast **C**hina **S**ea,
Allison explored how well-established flashpoints involving China and
the **United States** and its allies could spiral into unwanted
war.]{.underline} Allison's article argues that [given the context of
strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power,
organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of
unintended escalation]{.underline}. According to Allison, "the
underlying stress created by China's disruptive rise creates conditions
in which accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a
large-scale conflict." [This argument appears persuasive on its
surface]{.underline}, in no small part because it evokes insights from
some of Allison's groundbreaking work on the organizational pathologies
that made the Cuban Missile Crisis so dangerous.

[However]{.underline}, Allison ultimately [fails to]{.underline}
persuade because he fails to [specify the political and strategic
conditions that make war plausible in the first place]{.underline}.
Allison's analysis implies that the United States and China are in a
situation analogous to that of the Soviet Union and the United States in
the early 1960s. [In the Cold War]{.underline} example, [the two
countries faced each other on a near-war footing and engaged in a bitter
geostrategic and ideological struggle for supremacy. The two countries
experienced a series of militarized crises and fought each other
repeatedly through **proxy wars**.]{.underline} It was this broader
context that made issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a crisis.

[By contrast, the U.S.-China relationship today operates at a much
**lower level of hostility and threat**]{.underline}. [China and the
**U**nited **S**tates may be experiencing an increase in tensions, but
the two countries remain far from the bitter, acrimonious rivalry that
defined the U.S.-Soviet relationship]{.underline} [in the early
1960s.]{.underline} [Neither Washington nor Beijing regards the other as
its principal enemy.]{.underline} Today's rivals may view each other
warily as competitors and threats on some issues, but [they]{.underline}
also [view each other as **important trade partners**]{.underline} [and
partners on some shared concerns, such as **No**rth
**Ko**rea]{.underline}, as the recent summit between President Donald
Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping illustrated. [The behavior of
their respective militaries underscores the relatively restrained
rivalry]{.underline}. [The military competition between China and the
**U**nited **S**tates may be growing,]{.underline} [but it operates at a
far lower level of intensity than the relentless **arms
racing**]{.underline} [that typified the U.S.-Soviet
standoff.]{.underline} And [unlike their Cold War counterparts, U.S. and
Chinese militaries are **not postured to fight each other** in major
wars.]{.underline} Moreover, polls show that the people of the two
countries regard each other with mixed views ---a considerable contrast
from the hostile sentiment expressed by the U.S. and Soviet publics for
each other. [Lacking both preparations for major war and a constituency
for conflict, leaders and bureaucracies in both countries have **less
incentive to misjudge crisis situations**]{.underline} [in favor of
unwarranted escalation.]{.underline}

To the contrary, [political leaders and bureaucracies currently face a
strong incentive to find ways of defusing crises in a manner that avoids
unwanted escalation.]{.underline} This inclination manifested itself in
the EP-3 airplane collision off Hainan Island in 2001, and in subsequent
incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft, such as the
harassment of the USNS Impeccable in 2009. This does not mean that there
is no risk, however. Indeed, the potential for a dangerous militarized
crisis may be growing. Moreover, key political and geostrategic
developments could shift the incentives for leaders in favor of more
escalatory options in a crisis and thereby make Allison's scenarios more
plausible. Past precedents offer some insight into the types of
developments that would most likely propel the U.S.-China relationship
into a hostile, competitive one featuring an elevated risk of conflict.

[The most important driver,]{.underline} as Allison recognizes, [would
be a growing parity between China and the **U**nited **S**tates as
economic, technological and geostrategic leaders of the international
system. The **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [and China feature an
increasing parity in the size of their economies, but the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} **[retains a considerable lead in virtually
every other dimension of national power]{.underline}**. The current
U.S.-China rivalry is a regional one centered on the Asia-Pacific
region, but it retains the considerable potential of escalating into a
global, systemic competition down the road. [A second important driver
would be the mobilization of public opinion behind]{.underline} the view
that the other country is a primary source of threat, thereby providing
a stronger constituency for escalatory policies. A related development
would be the formal designation by leaders in both capitals of the other
country as a primary hostile threat and likely foe. These developments
would most likely be fueled by a growing array of intractable disputes,
and further accelerated by a serious militarized crisis. The cumulative
effect would be the exacerbation of an antagonistic competitive rivalry,
repeated and volatile militarized crisis, and heightened risk that any
flashpoint could escalate rapidly to war---a relationship that would
resemble the U.S.-Soviet relationship in the early 1960s.

[Yet even if the relationship evolved towards a more hostile form of
rivalry, unique features of the contemporary world suggest lessons drawn
from the past may have limited applicability]{.underline}. **[Economic
interdependence]{.underline}** [in the twenty-first century is much
different and far more complex than in it was in the past]{.underline}.
[So is the **lethality of weaponry available**]{.underline} [to the
major powers]{.underline}. In the sixteenth century, armies fought with
pikes, swords and primitive guns. In the twenty-first century, [it is
possible to eliminate all life on the planet in a full-bore nuclear
exchange. These features likely affect the willingness of leaders to
escalate in a crisis in a manner far differently than in past
rivalries.]{.underline}

[More broadly]{.underline}, Allison's analysis about [the "Thucydides
Trap" may be criticized for exaggerating the risks of war]{.underline}.
In his claims to identify a high propensity for war between "rising" and
"ruling" countries, he fails to clarify those terms, and does not
distinguish the more dangerous from the less volatile types of
rivalries. Contests for supremacy over land regions, for example, have
historically proven the most conflict-prone, while competition for
supremacy over maritime regions has, by contrast, tended to be less
lethal. [Rivalries]{.underline} also [wax and wane over time, with
varying levels of risks of war]{.underline}. [A more careful review of
rivalries and their variety, duration and patterns of interaction
suggests that although most wars involve rivalries, **many rivals avoid
going to war**]{.underline}.

#### No CCP collapse\-\--resilience, meritocracy, and legitimacy check\-\--and they'll [adapt]{.underline}, not [lash-out]{.underline}, if threatened

directors of China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and is

the Party," Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, 92.1, EBSCO

In November 2012, [the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
([CCP]{.underline}) held its 18th National Congress, setting in motion a
once-in-a-decade [transfer of power]{.underline} to a new generation of
leaders. As expected, Xi Jinping took over as general secretary and will
become the president of the People\'s Republic this March. The turnover
[was]{.underline} a [smooth and well-orchestrated]{.underline}
demonstration by a confidently rising superpower. [That didn\'t
stop]{.underline} international [media]{.underline} and even some
Chinese intellectuals, however, [from portraying it as a moment of
crisis.]{.underline} In an issue that was published before the beginning
of the congress, for example, The Economist quoted unnamed scholars at a
recent conference as saying that China is \"unstable at the grass roots,
dejected at the middle strata and out of control at the top.\" To be
sure, months before the handover, the scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, the
former party boss of the Chongqing municipality, had shattered the
CCP\'S long-held facade of unity, which had underwritten domestic
political stability since the Tiananmen Square upheavals in 1989. To
make matters worse, the Chinese economy, which had sustained
double-digit GDP growth for two decades, slowed, decelerating for seven
straight quarters. China\'s economic model of rapid industrialization,
labor-intensive manufacturing, large-scale government investments in
infrastructure, and export growth seemed to have nearly run its course.
[Some]{.underline} in China and the West [have gone so far as to predict
the demise of the one-party state]{.underline}, which they allege cannot
survive if leading politicians stop delivering economic miracles. [Such
pessimism]{.underline}, however, [is misplaced.]{.underline} There is no
doubt that daunting [challenges await Xi.]{.underline} [But those who
suggest that the CCP will not be able to deal with them **fundamentally
misread** China\'s politics and the resilience of its governing
institutions. Beijing will be able to meet the]{.underline} [country\'s
ills with]{.underline} dynamism and [**resilience**, thanks to the
CCP\'S **adaptability**, system of **meritocracy**, and **legitimacy**
with the Chinese people. In the next decade]{.underline}, China will
continue to rise, not fade. [The country\'s leaders will **consolidate
the one-party model** and]{.underline}, in the process, [challenge the
West\'s conventional wisdom about]{.underline} political development and
the [inevitable march toward electoral democracy.]{.underline} In the
capital of the Middle Kingdom, the world might witness the birth of a
post-democratic future. ON-THE-JOB LEARNING [The **assertion** that
one-party rule is inherently incapable of self-correction does not
reflect the **historical record**. During its 63 years in power, the CCP
has shown **extraordinary adaptability.**]{.underline} Since its
founding in 1949, the People\'s Republic has pursued a broad range of
economic policies. First, the CCP initiated radical land
collectivization in the early 1950s. This was followed by the policies
of the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and the Cultural Revolution
in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. After them came the quasi-privatization
of farmland in the early 1960s, Deng Xiaoping\'s market reforms in the
late 1970s, and Jiang Zemin\'s opening up of the CCP\'S membership to
private businesspeople in the 1990s. [The underlying goal has always
been economic health, and when a policy did not work]{.underline} \--
for example, the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution
\-- **[China was able to find something that did]{.underline}**: for
example, Deng\'s reforms, which catapulted the Chinese economy into the
position of second largest in the world. [On the institutional front as
well, the CCP has not shied away from reform. One example is the
introduction]{.underline} in the 1980s and 1990s [of term
limits]{.underline} for most political positions (and even of age
limits, of 68-70, for the party\'s most senior leadership). Before this,
political leaders had been able to use their positions to accumulate
power and perpetuate their rules. Mao Zedong was a case in point. He had
ended the civil wars that had plagued China and repelled foreign
invasions to become the father of modern China. Yet his prolonged rule
led to disastrous mistakes, such as the Cultural Revolution. Now, it is
nearly impossible for the few at the top to consolidate long-term power.
Upward mobility within the party has also increased. In terms of foreign
policy, China has also changed course many times to achieve national
greatness. It moved from a close alliance with Moscow in the 1950s to a
virtual alliance with the United States in the 1970s and 1980s as it
sought to contain the Soviet Union. Today, its pursuit of a more
independent foreign policy has once more put it at odds with the United
States. But in its ongoing quest for greatness, China is seeking to defy
recent historical precedents and rise peacefully, avoiding the
militarism that plagued Germany and Japan in the first half of the last
century. As China undergoes its ten-year transition, calls at home and
abroad for another round of political reform have increased. One radical
camp in China and abroad is urging the party to allow multiparty
elections or at least accept formal intraparty factions. In this view,
only full-scale adversarial politics can ensure that China gets the
leadership it needs. However sincere, these demands all miss a basic
fact: [the CCP has]{.underline} arguably [been one of the most
self-reforming political organizations in recent world
history]{.underline}. There is no doubt that Chinas new leaders face a
different world than Hu Jintao did when he took over in 2002, but
chances are good that [Xi\'s CCP will be able to adapt to and meet
whatever new challenges the rapidly changing domestic]{.underline} and
international [environments pose]{.underline}. In part, [that is because
the CCP is heavily meritocratic and promotes those with proven
experience and capabilities.]{.underline}

### 1AR Saudi Oil DA -- China Defense 

#### No US-China competition\-\--neither side wants international leadership, ideological conflict, or military clashes 

Yan **Xuetong 18**, Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of
California Berkeley, Dean of the Institute of International Relations at
Tsinghua University, 2/6/18, "Trump can't start a Cold War with China,
even if he wants to,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/02/06/china-trump/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cf538f7cdad3

Along with Russia, China was named as the chief strategic rival
challenging America's security, prosperity and values. This rhetoric,
backed up by formal doctrine, understandably brings about fears that
Sino-U.S. competition may drive the world into a new Cold War. Yet,
[while America's new policy toward China will inevitably have a strong
impact on international politics, it does not necessarily mean a coming
Cold War]{.underline}. There are three fundamental differences between
the Sino-U.S. competition today and the U.S.-Soviet rivalry during the
Cold War.

1\. [Unlike the U.S.-Soviet competition for global leadership during the
Cold War]{.underline}, **[both China and the U.S. today avoid
undertaking excessive international responsibility]{.underline}**.

The Trump administration's "[America First]{.underline}" posture
[regards global leadership as a burden rather than the most important
strategic interest]{.underline} of the U.S. It seeks to unload that
burden onto its military allies by asking them to pay more for their own
defense. Meanwhile, [the]{.underline} current [Chinese government
worries that the huge cost of global leadership would undermine its
economic growth.]{.underline}

Instead, Chinese President Xi Jinping has inherited and embraced the
concept of a "community of common destiny," coined by former President
Hu Jintao's administration. As the phrase implies, China wants every
member of the international community to share the responsibility of
global governance. To avoid excessive international responsibility, the
Chinese government avoids stationing troops in Afghanistan, for example,
even though instability there presents a direct threat to the security
of neighboring Xinjiang, a frontier region in China where separatist
sentiment has erupted in the past.

[As long as both China and the U.S. are reluctant to undertake global
leadership, a Cold War of the all-encompassing kind we saw between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union in the 20th century is unlikely to
occur]{.underline} --- even with the possibility that some secondary
powers may compete for regional leadership through military
confrontation.

2\. [Both China and the U.S. have so far purposely **constrained their
competition from spilling over** into the ideological
domain]{.underline} --- the precise opposite of what the U.S. and the
Soviets did during the Cold War.

[Trump has shown no interest in an ideological contest with
China]{.underline}. This was reflected in the National Defense Strategy,
which contains the statement, "We will not seek to impose our way of
life by force."

[The Chinese government is similarly alert to the danger of igniting an
ideological confrontation with the West and the U.S. in
particular.]{.underline} Soon after the international media reported
that the recent 19th Communist Party Congress revealed China's intention
to export a governance model that rivals Western democracy, the Chinese
government promptly sought to correct this misimpression by announcing
that China "will not ask other countries to copy the Chinese practice."
[As long as China and the U.S. don't prioritize advancing their
ideologies abroad above all else, their competition will not escalate to
the level of the old U.S.-Soviet rivalry.]{.underline}

3[. China's present strategic preference for **peaceful
competition**]{.underline} [with the U.S. differs greatly from that of
the Soviet Union or Russia today.]{.underline}

[Although China is dismayed and disappointed at being viewed as the
primary rival to the U.S.]{.underline} after giving Trump emperor-like
treatment during his visit to Beijing, [it still adheres to the
principle of peaceful competition rather than the proxy-war strategy the
Soviet Union adopted during the Cold War.]{.underline}

[Economics remains the most powerful element of China's national
strength, and its **military might lags far behind
America's**]{.underline}. Thus, **[China will try its best to avoid any
form of military clashes]{.underline}** [with the U.S. China also
insists it is not formally allied with Russia]{.underline}, America's
other rival, which has been confronting the U.S. order in Europe mainly
through proxy wars since the end of the Cold War. It should not go
unrecognized that wars in the Middle East and former Soviet zones have
not escalated to the global level, in no small part because China did
not join Russia. [China's behavior]{.underline} in these situations
[shows that China will not join league with Russia against the
U.S.]{.underline}, as happened with the East-West division during the
Cold War.

[The uncertainty of Trump's leadership is also a minor but favorable
factor in preventing a new Cold War]{.underline}. [The **inconsistency**
of America's foreign policy in the first year of his presidency has made
its allies cautious in supporting America's confrontation with
China.]{.underline}

[Victor Shih, a specialist in China\'s political economy]{.underline}
and international relations [at]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**niversity of **[C]{.underline}**alifornia, [San
Diego]{.underline}, [agrees]{.underline} that, in challenging times,
"[\'Stability trumps all\']{.underline}, as the Chinese saying goes \--
I think this is more true today than ever before." [Some]{.underline}
observers have [argue]{.underline}d that [a weaker Chinese leader, faced
with a slowing economy, might be more prone to provoking
confrontation]{.underline}, raising the potential for clashes between
China's fast-modernizing military, and regional rivals with whom
relations have been tense, including U.S. allies such as the
Philippines, Taiwan or Japan. The latter has just angered Beijing by
passing laws allowing its military to engage in overseas actions as well
as simply self-defense, for the first time since World War II.
[However]{.underline}, Lam says that [a more chastened Xi may need "a
foreign policy success" with the U.S. more than before]{.underline} \--
[making]{.underline} the chances of [an **accord** on cybersecurity,
foreign investment in China, or even]{.underline} some form of
**[agreement]{.underline}** [over the]{.underline} future of the
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, a
little [more likely]{.underline} on this trip. "[Xi is still
strong]{.underline} \-- [no other faction in China can threaten
him]{.underline} at the moment," Lam says, "but we have seen some dents
in his armor, and not everyone is happy." [A serious military
confrontation]{.underline} with the U.S. over the South China Sea [is
the last thing Xi needs at present,]{.underline} Lam adds. ["A skirmish
would cause panic in China,\"]{.underline} he says. [\"It would hit the
economy, the stock market might collapse \--]{.underline} and [they
can't afford that]{.underline}." Over the past two years, Lam says, [the
world has seen a more assertive China]{.underline} flexing its muscles
\-- [without planning to go too far in provoking others]{.underline}.

#### No china war

**Kausikan 16** (Bilahari, Ambassador-at-large and policy adviser in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Institute of Policy Studies\'
2015/16 S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, "War is unlikely
but distrust runs deep," Feb 27 2016,
http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/war-is-unlikely-but-distrust-runs-deep)

This is not a question that should lend itself to facile answers.
**[US-China relations]{.underline}** defy simple characterisation. But
it **[is certainly not \"a Clash of Civilisations\".]{.underline}**¶
**[China could not have succeeded without the US.]{.underline}**
China\'s success is, in a very fundamental way, also an American
success, albeit a not entirely comfortable one for America. This perhaps
adds in no small part to the complexity of the strategic adjustments
that are under way between the US and China. But whether it admits it or
not, the US too has begun to adapt. There can be no \"Clash of
Civilisations\" because we are now all hybrids.¶ The inevitably
irregular rhythms of economic growth ought to make us cautious about
accepting simplistic characterisations of US-China relations as some
variant of a contrast between a rising China and a declining US. This
posits a false dichotomy. China is certainly rising but the US is not in
decline. All who have underestimated American creativity and resilience
have come to regret it. The changes in the distribution of power are
relative, not absolute. The US is still pre-eminent in most indices of
power and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.¶ This is
most obvious in the military realm. **[Before too long, China will reach
a more symmetrical military equation with the US in East
Asia]{.underline}**. This will have very important implications for the
maritime disputes in the South China Sea. **[While military planners
cannot ignore any contingency, war is not a very probable
scenario.]{.underline}** **[Neither the US nor China is looking for
trouble or spoiling for a fight.]{.underline}** **[The essential
priorities of both are internal, not external. The most vital of all
Chinese interests is the preservation of]{.underline}** Chinese
Communist Party (**[CCP) rule.]{.underline}** **[Chinese leaders
sometimes talk tough. But they are not reckless]{.underline}**.¶ As the
sole global power, the US cannot retreat into complete isolationism.
Like it or not, the world will intrude and in East Asia specifically,
there has been a fundamental consistency in US policy over the last 40
years or more that I expect will be maintained.¶ But the political mood
that has sustained contenders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their
unlikely presidential campaigns is disillusionment with globalisation
and working- and middle-class insecurity about their future in an
increasingly unfamiliar and uncertain world. Whoever next occupies the
White House will talk and even act tougher. But **[no American president
can ignore the national mood, which is not for more wars of
choice]{.underline}**.¶ If **[war between the US and China is highly
improbable]{.underline}**, is there or will there be a \"new Cold War\"
between the two? **[There will almost certainly be tense episodes. But I
do not think this is]{.underline}** an **[appropriate]{.underline}**
metaphor **[to understand the US-China dynamic]{.underline}**.¶ So where
does all this leave us? I do not think it makes the strategic
adjustments any easier. But it does imply that **[the parameters within
which the US and China]{.underline}** must **[seek]{.underline}** a new
**[accommodation are narrower than]{.underline}** what
**[we]{.underline}** might **[have been led to expect by]{.underline}**
the media or the more **[sensationalist]{.underline}** sort of academic
**[analysis]{.underline}**.

## Aff Impact Offense -- Renewables

### 2AC Saudi Oil DA -- Renewables Turn 

#### Renewable energy is stalling -- it needs more momentum to prevent dangerous climate change 

**Cunningham 19** (Nick Cunningham, writer on energy, citing data from
the IEA, May 8, 2019. "IEA: Renewables growth is stalling."
http://www.mining.com/web/iea-renewables-growth-stalling/)

**[Renewable energy]{.underline}** [deployment]{.underline} **[stalled
out]{.underline}** last year, [raising]{.underline} **[alarm
bells]{.underline}** [about the **pace of the clean energy
transition**]{.underline}. [In 2018, total deployment of renewable
energy stood at about 180 gigawatts (GW), which was the **same as the
previous year**]{.underline}. [It was the first time since 2001 that
capacity failed to increase year-on-year, according to the International
Energy Agency (IEA).]{.underline} Adding 180 GW of clean energy is a
massive total, but still **[falls short]{.underline}** [of what
is]{.underline} **[needed]{.underline}** to clean up the electricity
sector. It equates to roughly 60 percent of what is needed each year in
order to meet long-term climate goals, the IEA said. The agency said
that [the world]{.underline} [needs]{.underline} to add about **[300
GW]{.underline}** [of renewable energy]{.underline} **[each
year]{.underline}** [through 2030]{.underline} in order [to
meet]{.underline} the targets laid out in the **[Paris]{.underline}**
Climate Agreement. Worse, last year, **[CO2 emissions]{.underline}**
[from energy **rose 1.7 percent**]{.underline}, [setting another record
high at 33 Gigatonnes]{.underline}. So, [while emissions]{.underline}
[need to decline sharply]{.underline}, **[they haven't even flattened
out yet]{.underline}**. [Renewable energy continues to grow, but **so
does demand for oil and gas**]{.underline}. "The world cannot afford to
press "pause" on the expansion of renewables and governments need to act
quickly to correct this situation and enable a faster flow of new
projects," Fatih Birol, the IEA's Executive Director, said in a
statement. "Thanks to rapidly declining costs, the competitiveness of
renewables is no longer heavily tied to financial incentives. What they
mainly need are stable policies supported by a long-term vision but also
a focus on integrating renewables into power systems in a cost-effective
and optimal way. Stop-and-go policies are particularly harmful to
markets and jobs," Birol added. For the last four years, growth of wind
had slowed, but the gap was made up by faster growth from solar. The
difference in 2018 was that solar's exponential growth flattened out.
The reason for that lies in China, where the government pared back
incentives on solar in order to cut expenditures and cope with grid
integration challenges, the IEA said. Still, China added 44 GW of solar
last year, the most by far out of any other country and nearly half of
the 97 GW global total. But that was down from 53 GW that China
installed in 2017. Costs continue to fall, making renewable energy the
cheapest option in many markets, which should ensure strong growth going
forward. In the U.S., wind and solar are now cheaper than operating
existing coal plants in much of the country. In fact, in April,
renewable energy surpassed coal in terms of electricity generation for
the first time, accounting for 24 percent of the total, compared to
coal's 20 percent market share. But, **[despite the
momentum]{.underline}**, [the transition is **not fast
enough**]{.underline}. A new UN report finds that the world is facing a
mass die-off of biodiversity, with as many as one million plant and
animal species at risk of extinction. Also, [the world is on track to
**blow through its carbon budget** within 12 years]{.underline}.

#### High oil prices are key to spur renewable energy development 

**Elliot 18** (Larry Elliot, economics editor at the Guardian, October
18, 2018. "Saudi Arabia has the most to lose from a sharp rise in oil
prices."
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/21/saudi-arabia-most-lose-rise-oil-prices-riyadh-weaponise-west)

The White House has not specified whether "very severe" includes the
sort of punitive economic and financial sanctions recently imposed on
Iran, but if it does [the **Saudis** say they will]{.underline}
[retaliate by **weaponising oil**.]{.underline} The message is clear.
Back off or we will hurt you just as we did in the 1970s. There would be
serious economic consequences were events to unfold in this way. The
price of crude rose after Trump announced sanctions on Iran, and Saudi
Arabia is a much more significant player. Oil prices are already
hovering around the \$80 a barrel mark and would spike to well over
\$100 a barrel should Saudi impose significant output curbs. Oil hit a
peak price, unadjusted for inflation, of [\$147 a

in the summer of 2008 and could easily return to that sort of level.
[The question, though, is whether the Sauds would be **dumb enough to
act in such a fashion**]{.underline}, because the lesson of 1973 is that
the short-term gains from cutting off oil supplies are outweighed by the
long-term costs. What's more, the costs are higher and the benefits are
smaller than they were in the 1970s. For a start, new sources of oil
have emerged in the past four and a half decades. [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia) was second to
Russia in the table of oil producers in 2016, with the US in third place
as a result of the expansion of shale production. [Saudi production
matters, but not as much as it did]{.underline}. [Developed economies
are]{.underline} also **[much less oil-intensive]{.underline}** [than
they were in the 1970s]{.underline}. That's partly the result of the
shift from manufacturing to services, and partly because **[high oil
prices]{.underline}** in the 1970s [encourage]{.underline}d [industry to
become **more energy-efficient**]{.underline}. In the past 25 years, the
amount of energy needed per dollar of economic output has fallen by a
third. The two oil shocks of the 1970s -- the one in 1973-74 was
followed by a second in 1979-80 - were both followed by deep recessions
that brought the price crashing down. By the mid-1980s, a glut of crude
meant oil prices adjusted for inflation had fallen by 75% from their
peak. By then, [oil-importing countries]{.underline} had [realised their
**vulnerability**]{.underline} [and had begun
**diversifying**]{.underline} [into]{.underline} natural gas and
**[nuclear]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} **[biggest
beneficiaries]{.underline}** [of **Saudi output curbs
today**]{.underline} [would be [**solar and wind
producers**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/26/study-wind-and-solar-can-power-most-of-the-united-states)]{.underline}.
[The unit cost of renewables has already fallen]{.underline} sharply as
a result of technological advances, and **[each ratcheting
up]{.underline}** [of oil prices will make **solar and wind more
competitive**]{.underline}. If the west has become less oil-dependent,
the opposite is true for Saudi Arabia, which, according to estimates
from the International Monetary Fund, [needs oil prices of \$85-87 a
barrel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arabia-imf/saudi-arabia-needs-oil-at-85-87-a-barrel-to-balance-budget-imf-official-idUSKBN1I30H7)
to balance its budget. The country's reliance on oil revenues was
exposed in the period between 2014 and 2016, when the price of crude
collapsed from \$110 to \$30 a barrel. During that time, the Saudi
budget deficit increased from 3.5% to 15.8% of GDP, necessitating
unpopular austerity measures for a population grown accustomed to free
public services, generous welfare benefits and subsidised energy. Riyadh
knows that it needs to diversify out of oil, but the plan is to do so at
a pace that does not lead to social unrest. Half of the population is
under the age of 25 and the unemployment rate is more than 12%, a
potentially combustible mix. The whole point of organising an
[investment
conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/liam-fox-pulls-out-of-saudi-event-over-alleged-of-jamal-khashoggi)
this week that so many western politicians are now boycotting was to
expand the non-oil sectors of the economy. What does all this mean? It
means, simply, that the country with most to lose from a sharp rise in
oil prices would be Saudi Arabia itself. Claims that western sanctions
would prompt retaliatory action of such severity that they would derail
the global economy are a gigantic bluff.

discussed. It will, in the long run, bring on not just climate shocks,
but also worldwide
[instability](http://nypost.com/2014/03/30/climate-change-will-push-world-into-war-un-report),
insurrection, and warfare]{.underline}. In this sense, [COP-21 should be
considered not just a climate summit but a peace conference---perhaps
the most significant peace convocation in history]{.underline}. To grasp
why, consider **[the latest scientific findings]{.underline}** [on
the]{.underline} likely [**impacts** of]{.underline} global
[warming]{.underline}, [especially the [2014
report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/) of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC).]{.underline} When first published, that report
attracted worldwide media coverage for [predict]{.underline}ing that
**[unchecked climate change]{.underline}** [will [result
in](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/climatechange/10733764/IPCC-report-No-one-will-be-untouched-by-climate-change.html)
**severe droughts**]{.underline}, intense **[storms]{.underline}**,

**[flooding]{.underline}**, all [leading to]{.underline} **[widespread

punishing drought in California and crippling heat waves in Europe and
Asia, have focused more attention on just such impacts. The IPCC report,
however, suggested that global **[warming]{.underline}** [would have
**devastating impacts**]{.underline} of a [social and
political](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/30/ipcc_2014_u_n_climate_change_report_warns_of_dire_consequences.html)
nature as well, [including]{.underline} **[economic

[**[resource
wars]{.underline}**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805055762/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20).
These predictions have received far less attention, and yet the
possibility of such a future should be obvious enough since human
**[institutions]{.underline}**, like natural systems, [are
vulnerable]{.underline} [to climate change]{.underline}. [Economies are
going to suffer when key commodities---crops, timber, fish,
livestock---grow scarcer, are destroyed, or fail. **Societies** will
begin to **buckle** under the strain of **economic decline** and
**massive refugee flows**]{.underline}. Armed conflict may not be the
most immediate consequence of these developments, the IPCC notes, but
**[combine]{.underline}** the effects of [climate change
with]{.underline} already **[existing poverty]{.underline}**,
**[hunger]{.underline}**, **[resource scarcity]{.underline}**,
incompetent and corrupt governance, [and]{.underline} ethnic, religious,

**[food]{.underline}**, **[water]{.underline}**, land, and other
necessities of life. **[THE COMING OF CLIMATE CIVIL WARS]{.underline}**
Such wars would not arise in a vacuum. [Already existing stresses and
grievances would be heightened, enflamed undoubtedly by provocative acts
and the exhortations of demagogic leaders]{.underline}. Think of the
current outbreak of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories,
touched off by
[clashes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/world/middleeast/fears-of-new-intifada-accompany-surge-in-mideast-violence.html)
over access to the [Temple
Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount) in Jerusalem (also
known as the Noble Sanctuary) and the inflammatory rhetoric of assorted
leaders. [Combine economic and resource deprivation with such situations
and you have a **perfect recipe for war**]{.underline}. The necessities
of life are already unevenly distributed across the planet. Often [the
divide between those with access to adequate supplies of vital resources
and those lacking them coincides with long-term schisms along racial,
ethnic, religious, or linguistic lines]{.underline}. The Israelis and
Palestinians, for example, harbor deep-seated ethnic and religious
hostilities but also experience vastly different possibilities when it
comes to [access](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11101797) to
land and water. [Add the stresses of climate change to such situations
and you can naturally expect passions to boil over]{.underline}.
[Climate change will]{.underline} [**[degrade or
destroy]{.underline}**](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/earth/climate.html)
many [**[natural
systems]{.underline}**](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176054/tomgram%3A_michael_klare,_tipping_points_and_the_question_of_civilizational_survival/),
[often already under stress, on which humans **rely for their
survival**.]{.underline} Some areas that now support agriculture or
animal husbandry may become uninhabitable or capable only of providing
for greatly diminished populations. [Under the pressure of rising
temperatures and increasingly fierce droughts, the southern fringe of
the Sahara desert, for example, is now being
[transformed](http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/desertificationinsahel.html)
from grasslands capable of sustaining nomadic herders into an empty
wasteland, forcing local nomads off their ancestral lands]{.underline}.
Many existing farmlands in **[Africa]{.underline}**,
**[Asia]{.underline}**, [and the]{.underline} **[Middle
East]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} **[suffer]{.underline}** a
similar fate. Rivers that once supplied water year-round will run only
sporadically or [dry
up](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/16/AR2007061600461.html)
altogether, again leaving populations with unpalatable choices. [As the
IPCC report points out, enormous pressure will be put upon often weak
state institutions to adjust to climate change and aid those in
desperate need of emergency food, shelter, and other necessities.
"Increased human insecurity," the report says, "may coincide with a
decline in the capacity of states to conduct effective adaptation
efforts, thus creating the circumstances in which there is greater
potential for violent conflict." A good example of this peril is
provided by the outbreak of civil war in Syria and the subsequent
collapse of that country in a welter of fighting and a wave of refugees
of a sort that hasn't been seen since World War II.]{.underline} Between
2006 and 2010, Syria experienced a [devastating
drought](http://www.npr.org/2013/09/08/220438728/how-could-a-drought-spark-a-civil-war)
in which climate change is believed to have been a factor, turning
nearly 60 percent of the country into desert. Crops failed and most of
the country's livestock perished, forcing millions of farmers into
penury. Desperate and unable to live on their land any longer, they
[moved](http://www.irinnews.org/report/85963/syria-drought-driving-farmers-to-the-cities)
into Syria's major cities in search of work, often facing [extreme
hardship](http://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)
as well as hostility from well-connected urban elites. Had Syrian
autocrat Bashar al-Assad responded with an emergency program of jobs and
housing for those displaced, perhaps conflict could have been averted.
Instead, he cut food and fuel subsidies, adding to the misery of the
migrants and fanning the flames of revolt. In the
[view](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241) of several prominent
scholars, "the rapidly growing urban peripheries of Syria, marked by
illegal settlements, overcrowding, poor infrastructure, unemployment,
and crime, were neglected by the Assad government and became the heart
of the developing unrest." A similar picture has unfolded in the Sahel
region of Africa, the southern fringe of the Sahara, where severe
drought has combined with habitat decline and government neglect to
provoke armed violence. The area has faced many such periods in the
past, but now, thanks to climate change, there is less time between the
droughts. "Instead of 10 years apart, they became five years apart, and
now only a couple years apart,"
[observes](http://www.npr.org/2013/09/08/220438728/how-could-a-drought-spark-a-civil-war)Robert
Piper, the United Nations regional humanitarian coordinator for the
Sahel. "And that, in turn, is putting enormous stresses on what is
already an incredibly fragile environment and a highly vulnerable
population." In Mali, one of several nations straddling this region, the
nomadic [Tuaregs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people) have been
particularly [hard hit](http://www.economist.com/node/21550324), as the
grasslands they rely on to feed their cattle are turning into desert. A
Berber-speaking Muslim population, the Tuaregs have long faced hostility
from the central government in Bamako, once controlled by the French and
now by black Africans of Christian or animist faith. With their
traditional livelihoods in peril and little assistance forthcoming from
the capital, the Tuaregs
[revolted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mali_conflict)in
January 2012, capturing half of Mali before being driven back into the
Sahara by French and other foreign forces (with US logistical and

[Consider the events in Syria and Mali previews of what is likely to

waves](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/science/intolerable-heat-may-hit-the-middle-east-by-the-end-of-the-century.html)
in regions that are already hot, ever more parts of the planet will be
rendered less habitable, pushing millions of people into desperate
flight]{.underline}. While the strongest and wealthiest governments,
especially in more temperate regions, will be better able to cope with
these stresses, [expect to see the number of **[failed

open **warfare** over what food, arable land, and shelter
remains]{.underline}. In other words, [imagine significant parts of the
planet in the kind of state that Libya, Syria, and Yemen are in
today.]{.underline} Some people will stay and fight to survive; others
will migrate, almost assuredly encountering a far more violent version
of the
[hostility](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Refugees-Immigrants-Met-with-Racist-Violence-Across-Europe-20151023-0015.html)
we already see toward immigrants and refugees in the lands they head
for. [The result]{.underline}, **[inevitably]{.underline}**, [will be a
**global epidemic of resource civil wars and resource violence of every
sort**]{.underline}. [WATER WARS Most of these conflicts will be of an
internal, civil character: clan against clan, tribe against tribe, sect
against sect]{.underline}. **[On a climate-changed planet, however,
don't rule out struggles among nations for diminished vital
resources---especially access to wate]{.underline}**r. It's already
clear that climate change will
[reduce](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/12/16/study-climate-change-could-put-millions-more-at-risk-of-water-scarcity)
the supply of water in many tropical and subtropical regions,
jeopardizing the continued pursuit of agriculture, the health and
functioning of [major
cities](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/oct/22/why-water-running-out/),
and possibly the very sinews of society. [The risk of "[**water
wars**](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/8/the-coming-water-wars/)"
will arise]{.underline} when two or more countries depend on the same
key water source---the Nile, the Jordan, the Euphrates, the Indus, the
Mekong, or other trans-boundary river systems---and one or more of them
seek to appropriate a disproportionate share of the ever-shrinking
supply of its water. [Attempts by countries to build dams and divert the
water flow of such riverine systems have already
[provoked](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/mideast_water_wars_in_iraq_a_battle_for_control_of_water/2796/)
skirmishes and threats of war, as when Turkey and Syria erected dams on
the Euphrates, constraining the downstream flow. ﻿ One system that has
attracted particular concern in this regard is the [Brahmaputra
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River), which
originates in China (where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo) and
passes through India and Bangladesh before emptying into the Indian
Ocean. China has already
[erected](http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/water-wars-china-india-and-the-great-dam-rush/)
one dam on the river and has plans for more, producing considerable
unease in India, where the Brahmaputra's water is vital for
agriculture]{.underline}. But what has provoked the most alarm is a
[Chinese
plan](http://japanfocus.org/-Brahma-Chellaney/2458/article.html) to
channel water from that river to water-scarce areas in the northern part
of that country. The Chinese insist that no such action is imminent, but
intensified warming and increased drought could, in the future, prompt
such a move, jeopardizing India's water supply and possibly provoking a
conflict. "China's construction of dams and the proposed diversion of
the Brahmaputra's waters is not only expected to have repercussions for
water flow, agriculture, ecology, and lives and livelihoods downstream,"
Sudha Ramachandran
[writes](http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/water-wars-china-india-and-the-great-dam-rush/)
in The Diplomat, "it could also become another contentious issue
undermining Sino-Indian relations." Of course, even in a future of far
greater water stresses, such situations are not guaranteed to provoke
armed combat. Perhaps the states involved will figure out how to share
whatever limited resources remain and seek alternative means of
survival. Nonetheless, the temptation to employ force is bound to grow
as supplies dwindle and millions of people face thirst and starvation.
In such circumstances, the survival of the state itself will be at risk,
inviting desperate measures. LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE There is much that
undoubtedly could be done to reduce the risk of water wars, including
the adoption of cooperative water-management schemes and the
introduction of the wholesale use of [drip
irrigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_irrigation) and related
processes that use water far more efficiently. However, [the best way to
**avoid** future climate-related **strife** is, of course, to **reduce
the pace of global warming**.]{.underline} **[Every
fraction]{.underline}** [of a degree less warming achieved]{.underline}
in Paris and thereafter [will mean]{.underline} that **[much
less]{.underline}** blood spilled in future climate-driven resource
**[war]{.underline}**s. This is why the Paris climate summit should be
viewed as a kind of preemptive peace conference, one that is taking
place before the wars truly begin. If delegates to COP-21 succeed in
sending us down a path that limits global warming to 2 degrees Celsius,
the risk of future violence will be diminished accordingly. Needless to
say, even 2 degrees of warming
[guarantees](http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2013/12/hansen-2-degree-c-goal-for-global-warming-disastrous/)
substantial damage to vital natural systems, potentially severe resource
scarcities, and attendant civil strife. As a result, a lower ceiling for
temperature rise would be preferable and should be the goal of future
conferences. Still, given the carbon emissions
[pouring](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/06/global-carbon-dioxide-levels-break-400ppm-milestone)
into the atmosphere, even a 2-degree cap would be a significant
accomplishment. To achieve such an outcome, delegates will undoubtedly
have to begin dealing with conflicts of the present moment as well,
including those in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Ukraine, in order to
collaborate in devising common, mutually binding climate measures. In
this sense, too, the Paris summit will be a peace conference. For the
first time, the nations of the world will have to step beyond national
thinking and embrace a higher goal: the safety of the ecosphere and all
its human inhabitants, no matter their national, ethnic, religious,
racial, or linguistic identities. Nothing like this has ever been
attempted, which means that it will be an exercise in peacemaking of the
most essential sort---and, for once, before the wars truly begin.

### 1AR Renewables Turn -- UQ/IL

#### Renewables are key to solve climate change, but accelerated deployment is key 

**IRENA 18** (International Renewable Energy Agency, citing the IPCC,
October 8, 2018. "Accelerating Renewables Is Our Most Effective Climate
Solution."
https://www.irena.org/newsroom/articles/2018/Oct/Accelerating-Renewables-Is-Our-Most-Effective-Climate-Solution)

With the UN Climate Conference in Katowice (COP24) only weeks away, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released the
much-awaited Special Report on [Global Warming of 1.5
°C](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/). In its assessment of 1.5 °C
pathway scenarios, [the]{.underline} **[IPCC]{.underline}** [highlights
the **need**]{.underline} [for a **rapid energy
transition**]{.underline} [based on a **significant increase of
renewables**]{.underline} particularly in end-use sectors. Commenting on
this, Adnan Z. Amin, Director-General of the International Renewable
Energy Agency (IRENA) today welcomed the report's focus on the
**[critical role of renewable energy]{.underline}** [in tackling climate
change and urged the global community to accelerate its
deployment]{.underline}. **[No climate solution without
renewables]{.underline}** "The IPCC report sends a **[clear
signal]{.underline}** [and calls for a large-scale transformation of the
global energy system]{.underline}. [A]{.underline}
**[decarbonised]{.underline}** [energy system]{.underline},
[increasingly fueled by **renewable sources**]{.underline},
[is]{.underline} **[vital]{.underline}** [to the global response to the
threat of **climate change**]{.underline}", Adnan Z. Amin said. "IRENA's
analysis shows that **[renewable energy]{.underline}** and energy
efficiency [represent the most]{.underline}
cost-**[effective]{.underline}** [pathway for]{.underline} achieving 90
per cent of the energy-related [CO2 emission reductions]{.underline}
**[needed]{.underline}** [to meet]{.underline} the 'well below 2 degrees
objective' of the **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement". "The world of
energy is witnessing rapid and disruptive changes. Renewables already
account for around a quarter of global electricity generation. In the
last six years, renewable power capacity additions outpaced additions
from fossil fuels and nuclear power combined. However, [if we are to
meet our **climate goals**]{.underline}, [renewables deployment **must
accelerate**]{.underline} six times faster than today."

### 1AR Renewables Turn -- Oil Shocks -\> Renewables

#### Falling oil prices short circuit investment---that prevents meeting 2 degree targets that trigger irreversible climate change 

**Wile 15** (Rob covers business, economics and the environment for
Fusion. He previously worked at Business Insider.)
<http://fusion.net/story/130014/yes-falling-oil-prices-are-derailing-the-future-of-renewable-energy/>

[**Falling oil and gas prices** have **short-circuited rollouts** of
**renewable energy** and alternative vehicle use, **setting back
progress** toward reaching climate goals]{.underline}, the world's top
energy body said Monday.¶ [In a new report, the]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[E]{.underline}**nergy
**[A]{.underline}**gency [warns much more investment will be needed in
tech]{.underline}nologies like the one Tesla unveiled Friday [because
current rates of financing are not enough to allow by less than the 2°
Celsius.]{.underline}¶ **[Many]{.underline}** analysts [had been
**hopeful** that renewable investment could **withstand** the price
drop]{.underline} brought about by America's shale oil and gas boom.¶
"Even with the price of oil being lower, cheaper materials have made
solar still far more practical," Jeff Osborne, an analyst with financial
services company Cowen Group, told CNBC in December.¶ **[But the IEA
says it's not happening.]{.underline}**¶ "[It is troubling that advances
in those areas that were showing strong promise]{.underline} -- such as
electric vehicles and all but solar photovoltaics (PV) in renewable
power technologies -- [are **no longer on track** to meet \[2° Celsius\]
targets,]{.underline}" the group said.¶ ["While the recent drop in
fossil fuel prices changes the short-term economic outlook of energy
markets, using it to justify a delay in energy system transformation
would be misguided in the long term]{.underline}. **[Short-term economic
gains and delaying investment in clean energy technologies will be
outweighed by longer-term costs]{.underline}**."¶ They outline which
countries are making progress the most progress toward decarbonizing
their energy systems. The largest fossil fuel producers, like the U.S.
and Russia, have shown almost none.¶ That's despite the fact that
[renewable energy is no longer more expensive than fossil
fuels]{.underline} --- one utility CEO, for instance, has said
electricity from residential rooftop solar is now as cheap as power from
the local grid in half the states in the Union.¶ "Utility scale solar PV
and onshore wind are now competitive with electricity generated by new
conventional power plants in an increasing number of locations," the IEA
says. "While the cost gap between electricity from renewables and that
from fossil fuels is narrowing, fossil plants still dominate recent
capacity additions. Together [with a slowdown in deployment rates of PV
and wind, this undermines the trajectory needed to decarbonise energy
supply and meet the 2DS renewable power targets]{.underline}."¶
Meanwhile, electric vehicle purchases in the U.S. have stagnated.
According to auto analysts at Edmunds.com,only 45 percent of this year's
hybrid and EV trade-ins have gone toward the purchase of another
alternative fuel vehicle. That's down from just over 60 percent in
2012.¶ **["Never before have loyalty rates for alt-fuel vehicles fallen
below 50 percent,"]{.underline}** they said."For better or worse, it
looks like many hybrid and EV owners are driven more by financial
motives rather than a responsibility to the environment."¶ On Friday,
electric automaker Tesla announced it was entering the energy business,
unveiling a home battery pack that can be paired with rooftop solar
panels to provide solar power throughout the day (since the sun doesn't
always shine). Batteries are one of the last major hurdles to having
reliable renewable energy (since the sun doesn't always shine), and
Tesla's is now among the cheapest on the market, and it relies heavily
on states incentives. Yet many of these subsidies are under attack by
fossil fuel friendly- utility commissions.¶ The IEA says trends like
these will have to be snuffed out to make climate goals.¶ ["For very
high deployment levels of wind and PV, innovation is needed in
demand-side integration, energy storage and smart grid infrastructure,"
the IEA says. "Widespread deployment of wind and PV technologies,
consistent with the 2DS, now requires an integrated and well-designed
policy and market regulatory framework."]{.underline}¶ Finally the group
makes an argument made by some in the fossil fuel divestment movement,
that investing in those resources represents a financial risk, since
they represent an inherent higher price risk.¶ "In fact, [shifting to
clean energy and achieving more efficient energy production and
consumption can provide an energy security hedge against future market
uncertainty]{.underline}," . Deployment of innovative technologies that
exploit clean domestic sources would reduce dependence on resources
exposed to market price fluctuations."

#### Second is Climate agreements- Low oil prices gut inertia for climate implementation -- destroys recent Paris agreement

**Yetiv 16** (Steve, professor of international relations at Old
Dominion University, "Cheap oil does have a downside," 1-2-16,
http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article52545010.html)

[Oil prices have **fallen dramatically**]{.underline} to the mid-\$30s
on the New York Mercantile Exchange from more than \$105 per barrel in
2014. How can we explain this crash and where are oil prices headed? The
global economy is in the doldrums, and China, the world's biggest oil
importer, appears plagued by economic problems it may or may not
overcome in the next few years. [Energy agencies have therefore lowered
global oil demand forecasts]{.underline}. [When traders believe oil
prices will rise, they buy futures in hopes of selling them later for a
profit]{.underline}. [Their actions **increase the price of
oil**]{.underline} and, eventually, the price of derivatives, such as
gasoline and heating oil. [That's not happening now because **traders
are pessimistic**]{.underline}. What usually happens in such
circumstances is that Saudi Arabia attacks the supply side -- that is,
it cuts production to boost prices. But the Saudis have decided not to
do so, probably because they believe that low oil prices have still not
done enough to undermine the North American energy boom and hurt their
nemesis, oil-rich Iran. Meanwhile, U.S. shale oil producers are
overflowing with oil. Traders see such oversupply as a bearish sign for
prices. Finally, although the Middle East is a political mess, its oil
supplies are relatively secure. The Iran nuclear agreement removed, for
now, the most likely chance of the type of war -- an attack on Iran --
that could spook markets. Even the Islamic State is not a significant
military threat to major oil fields. Sure, the terrorist organization is
stealing oil, but what it pumps from the areas it controls is just a
drop in the global bucket of oil, even though it makes tens of millions
doing it. Can oil prices rebound? China's economy won't bounce back
overnight. The Saudis may decide to cut production, but only if they
believe other OPEC countries will follow suit. As for the U.S. dollar,
it's pretty stable. So long as America is seen as a safer bet for
foreign investments than most other places, and so long as the Fed
follows through on raising interest rates, the dollar will remain
strong. On the other hand, American frackers will probably cut back
production in coming months. But that alone can only push prices up so
much. All this pressure on oil prices is just fine for the American and
global economy. But there is a downside to this story. [Negotiators who
**struck the climate change agreement** in Paris want to **send a
message** to the markets]{.underline} -- [that burning fossil fuels is
a]{.underline}n increasingly [costly habit]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
**[low oil prices]{.underline}** [are sending the **exact opposite
message**]{.underline}. The upshot is that low oil prices aren't
something to celebrate. [Over time, long investment horizons tend to
generate boom and bust cycles in oil production and prices]{.underline}.
But **[if prices remain low for too long]{.underline}**, [that will hurt
efforts to address climate change]{.underline}, [**especially in the
U.S.**,]{.underline} [where citizens largely oppose raising oil
taxes]{.underline}.

#### Third is CCS Tech- Higher oil prices create cost incentives to sequester carbon in EOR projects

**Veld 13** (Klaas van't Veld, Department of Economics & Finance,
University of Wyoming, "The economics of CO2 sequestration through
enhanced oil recovery," Energy Procedia 37, 2013)

Figure 3 shows the result at our baseline oil price of \$100/bl and
baseline CO2 sequestration subsidy of 40/tCO2). At these values, it is
optimal to initially inject a mix of about 50% CO2 and water, but to
gradually drop the CO2 fraction over time. After 22 years, the optimal
fraction drops to zero, after which the project optimally continues to
operate for another 31 years (so the optimal terminal time is 53 years)
while injecting only water. Paradoxically, when we then re-run the
simulations for a range of oil prices and CO2 subsidies, we find that
[**cumulative CO2 sequestration** is much more **responsive** to the
**oil price** than to the sequestration subsidy]{.underline}. As shown
in Figure 4, [halving the oil price to \$50/bl reduces cumulative
sequestration by 31%, while doubling the oil price to \$200/bl increases
cumulative sequestration by 24%]{.underline}. In contrast, halving the
subsidy to \$20/tCO2 reduces cumulative sequestration by only about 5%,
while doubling the subsidy to \$80/tCO2 increases cumulative
sequestration by only 11%. The reason is quite straightforward: [at
realistic oil-price and sequestration-subsidy levels, oil revenues make
up a]{.underline} far [large]{.underline}r [share of a project s profits
than do sequestration revenues]{.underline}. In terms of equation (4)
above, not only is the sequestration rate over most of the project s
lifetime less than half as large as the oil production rate (when both
are expressed in comparable units such as bl/year), but its weight is
orders of magnitude smaller: over the range of subsidies and prices
considered in Figure 4, the weight on sequestration varies from \$-1 to
\$5, while that on oil production varies from \$50 to \$200. As a
result, the operator s incentive, even with sequestration subsidies as
high as \$80/tCO2, is to largely ignore sequestration and instead manage
the project so as to maximize oil production alone. The relationship
between oil production and sequestration shown in Figure 2, however,
implies that [increasing oil production even slightly in **response to a
higher oil price** may require injecting]{.underline}, and hence
[sequestering]{.underline}, **[large amounts of additional
CO2]{.underline}**. For example, we find that [if the oil price
doubles]{.underline} from \$100 to \$200, the operator s optimal [CO2
injection rate over the first 30 years of the project **increases
45%,**]{.underline} from 2.25 million bl/year to 3.27 million bl/year.
[Doing so increases average oil production by only 2%,]{.underline} from
0.311 million bl/year to 0.317 million bl/year, [but]{.underline} this
2% [boosts oil revenues by \$1.2 million/year.]{.underline} [At the same
time the increased injection rate increases average CO2 sequestration by
24%, from 0.125 million bl/year to 0.155 million bl/year]{.underline},
but this implies a revenue boost from sequestration subsidies of only
\$0.12 million/year. From the operator s point of view, then, the boost
in CO2 sequestration, while significant in quantity terms, is just a
side effect in dollar terms. Conversely, even very high sequestration
subsidies will not induce the operator to alter project management by
much. A true tradeoff between oil revenues and CO2 sequestration emerges
only when the subsidy reaches levels as high as \$120/tCO2 (well above
realistic levels in the near future), and even then, the operator will
optimally give up only very small amounts of oil production in order to
boost CO2 sequestration. In terms of Figure 2, it is only at these very
high CO2 subsidy levels that the operator will briefly, at the very
beginning of the flood, choose a CO2 injection fraction higher than the
oil-productionmaximizing fraction of 0.625.

#### EOR projects create infrastructure -- necessary for widespread CCS utilization

**Veld 13** (Klaas van't Veld, Department of Economics & Finance,
University of Wyoming, "The economics of CO2 sequestration through
enhanced oil recovery," Energy Procedia 37, 2013)

[The process of injecting CO2 into mature oil fields to increase oil
production]{.underline}, referred to as CO2- enhanced oil recovery
(**[CO2-EOR]{.underline}**), contributes a significant and rapidly
growing portion of oil production in the US. According to the most
recent biannual survey of EOR production by the Oil & Gas Journal \[1\],
CO2-EOR projects now produce about 350,000 barrels/day (5.6% of total US
oil and gas production), compared to just 190,000 barrels/day (3.2%) in
the year 2000. This [is an **important development** for
**climate-change policy**]{.underline}, [because almost all of the
injected CO2 **remains underground** after fields are
decommissioned.]{.underline} Provided therefore that the CO2 comes from
anthropogenic sources, EOR [constitutes a form of carbon capture and
sequestration (**CCS**]{.underline}). Moreover, whereas projects that
inject CO2 into saline aquifers incur only costs, [EOR projects generate
revenues from the incremental oil that they recover]{.underline}.
Recognizing perhaps the political advantage in emphasizing that captured
CO2 can generate economic value, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has
in fact recently re-branded CCS to CCUS the U standing for utilization,
mostly in CO2-EOR projects \[2\]. [The DOE s most recent report on
CO2-EOR]{.underline} \[3\] [dramatizes the sequestration potential of
CO2-EOR projects by estimating that they could collectively sequester
the emissions from as many as 93 one-GW-size coalfired
power-plants]{.underline} for 30 years. In addition, it has widely been
argued that [promoting CO2-EOR may **provide a bridge** to **widespread
capture of CO2** for **storage in aquifers**]{.underline} ([which have
far greater sequestration capacity]{.underline}), [by helping pay for
**required infrastructure**]{.underline} (see, .e.g., \[4 6\], but see
also \[7\] for a dissenting view).

#### Commercialization of CCS technology is necessary to halt warming

**Guzman 09** (Doris de Guzman, ICIS -- world's largest petrochemical
market information provider, "Capturing carbon\'s potential", 1/15,
<http://www.icis.com/Articles/2009/01/15/9184929/chemicals-to-capture-ccs-potential.html>)

[CARBON CAPTURE and sequestration (CCS) technology might still be at an
experimental and development stage]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
several companies, including those in the chemical industry, are lining
up to take advantage of [its opportunities]{.underline}. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides
climate-change information, identified CCS as [the **most promising
technology** for the **rapid reduction of global emissions**. Carbon
dioxide]{.underline} (CO2 ) [is said to be capturable in significant
quantities]{.underline} from five main pollution sources, namely ammonia
production power generation from fossil fuels industrial production
facilities, such as cement, coal-to-chemicals, and steel plants energy
processing, such as coal and gas-to-liquids operations and well heads at
gas fields. The IPCC estimated that [CCS can reduce global emissions by
**up to 55%**]{.underline} by 2100, according to Graeme Sweeney,
executive vice president of future fuels and CO2 at Anglo-Dutch oil and
chemical major Shell[. \"Major volumes of oil, gas and coal are still
needed to meet rising global demand for energy]{.underline} in the
coming decades. [Left unmitigated, the cumulative global carbon
footprint will be dire for people and the planet. **Only CCS** has the
potential to cut the resulting CO2 emissions at the speed and scale
required,\"]{.underline} says Sweeney. The Paris, France-based
International Energy Agency (IEA) reported in its Energy Technology
Perspectives 2008 report that CCS would need to contribute nearly
one-fifth of the necessary emissions reductions to reduce global
greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050 if its cost is reasonable.
\"[CCS is therefore essential to the achievement of deep emission
cuts,\"]{.underline} said Nobuo Tanaka, IEA director, in a recent
statement. \"[If we do not **successfully demonstrate** CCS soon, it
will raise costs significantly for other climate-mitigation
options.\"]{.underline}

### 1AR Renewables Turn -- Warming -\> Extinction 

#### **Climate change is a [threat multiplier]{.underline} that makes all impacts [terminally non-unique]{.underline}** 

**Torres 16** (Phil Torres, PhD candidate @ Rice University in tropical
conservation biology, affiliate scholar @ Institute for Ethics and
Emerging Technologies, July 22, 2016. "Op-ed: Climate Change Is the Most
Urgent Existential Risk".
<http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/Torres20160807>)

[Humanity faces a number of formidable challenges]{.underline} this
century. [Threats]{.underline} to our collective survival [stem
from]{.underline} [asteroids]{.underline} and comets, supervolcanoes,
global [pandemics]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline},
biodiversity loss, [nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[biotechnology]{.underline}, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and
artificial superintelligence. With such threats in mind, an informal
survey conducted by the Future of Humanity Institute placed the
probability of human extinction this century at 19%. To put this in
perspective, it means that the average American is more than a thousand
times more likely to die in a human extinction event than a plane
crash.\* So, given limited resources, which risks should we prioritize?
Many intellectual leaders, including Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and
Bill Gates, have suggested that artificial superintelligence constitutes
one of the most significant risks to humanity. And this may be correct
in the long-term. But I would argue that two other risks, namely
**[climate change]{.underline}** and biodiveristy [loss]{.underline},
[should **take priority**]{.underline} right now [over]{.underline}
**[every other known threat]{.underline}**. Why? [Because these ongoing
catastrophes]{.underline} **[in slow-motion]{.underline}** [will frame
our **existential predicament**]{.underline} on Earth not just for the
rest of this century, but [for]{.underline} literally **[thousands of
years]{.underline}** to come. As such, [they]{.underline} [have the
capacity to **raise**]{.underline} or lower [the **probability of other
risks scenarios**]{.underline} [unfolding]{.underline}. Multiplying
Threats Ask yourself the following: [are **wars** more or less likely in
a world marked by **extreme weather events**]{.underline},
**[megadroughts]{.underline}**, **[food supply
disruptions]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} sea-level rise? [Are
**terrorist attacks**]{.underline} [**more** or less **likely** in a
world beset]{.underline} by **[the collapse of global
ecosystems]{.underline}**, **[agricultural failures]{.underline}**,
**[economic uncertainty]{.underline}**, and political instability? Both
[government officials and scientists agree]{.underline} that the answer
is **["more likely."]{.underline}** For example, the current Director of
the CIA, John [Brennan]{.underline}, recently [identified]{.underline}
"the impact of **[climate change]{.underline}**" [as one of the "deeper
causes of this rising instability"]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
countries like **[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Iraq]{.underline}**,
**[Yemen]{.underline}**, **[Libya]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. Similarly, the former Secretary of Defense,
Chuck [Hagel]{.underline}, has [described climate change as a **"threat
multiplier"**]{.underline} with "the potential to exacerbate many of the
challenges we are dealing with today --- from infectious disease to
terrorism." The Department of Defense has also affirmed a connection. In
a 2015 report, [it]{.underline} states, "Global [climate change will
aggravate]{.underline} problems such as **[poverty]{.underline}**,
**[social tensions]{.underline}**, environmental degradation,
**[ineffectual leadership]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[weak
political institutions]{.underline}** [that threaten
stability]{.underline} in a number of countries." **[Scientific studies
have further shown a connection between the environmental crisis and
violent conflicts.]{.underline}** For example, a 2015 paper in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argues that climate
change was a causal factor behind the record-breaking 2007-2010 drought
in Syria. This drought led to a mass migration of farmers into urban
centers, which fueled the 2011 Syrian civil war. Some observers,
including myself, have suggested that this struggle could be the
beginning of World War III, given the complex tangle of international
involvement and overlapping interests. The study's conclusion is also
significant because the Syrian civil war was the Petri dish in which the
Islamic State consolidated its forces, later emerging as the largest and
most powerful terrorist organization in human history. A Perfect Storm
The point is that [climate change]{.underline} and biodiversity loss
[could **very easily** push societies **to the brink of
collapse**]{.underline}. [This will exacerbate **existing geopolitical
tensions** and introduce entirely]{.underline} **[new power
struggles]{.underline}** between state and nonstate actors. At the same
time, advanced technologies will very likely become increasingly
powerful and accessible. As I've written elsewhere, the malicious agents
of the future will have bulldozers rather than shovels to dig mass
graves for their enemies. The result is a perfect storm of more
conflicts in the world along with unprecedentedly dangerous weapons. If
the conversation were to end here, we'd have ample reason for placing
climate change and biodiversity loss at the top of our priority lists.
But there are other reasons they ought to be considered urgent threats.
I would argue that they could make humanity more vulnerable to a
catastrophe involving superintelligence and even asteroids. The basic
reasoning is the same for both cases. Consider superintelligence first.
Programming a superintelligence whose values align with ours is a
formidable task even in stable circumstances. As Nick Bostrom argues in
his 2014 book, we should recognize the "default outcome" of
superintelligence to be "doom." Now imagine trying to solve these
problems amidst a rising tide of interstate wars, civil unrest,
terrorist attacks, and other tragedies? The societal stress caused by
climate change and biodiversity loss will almost certainly compromise
important conditions for creating friendly AI, such as sufficient
funding, academic programs to train new scientists, conferences on AI,
peer-reviewed journal publications, and communication/collaboration
between experts of different fields, such as computer science and
ethics. It could even make an "AI arms race" more likely, thereby
raising the probability of a malevolent superintelligence being created
either on purpose or by mistake. Similarly, [imagine]{.underline} that
astronomers discover [a]{.underline} behemoth asteroid [barreling
toward]{.underline} Earth. Will designing, building, and launching a
spacecraft to divert the assassin past our planet be easier or more
difficult in a world preoccupied with other survival issues? [In a
relatively peaceful world,]{.underline} [one could imagine an
asteroid]{.underline} actually [bringing humanity together]{.underline}
[by directing our attention **toward a common threat**.]{.underline}
**[But]{.underline}** if [the "**conflict multipliers**" of climate
change]{.underline} and biodiversity loss [have already **catapulted
civilization**]{.underline} [into]{.underline} chaos [and]{.underline}
turmoil, I strongly suspect that [humanity will become]{.underline}
[more]{.underline}, rather than less, [susceptible to
danger]{.underline}s of this sort. Context Risks We can describe the
dual threats of climate change and biodiversity loss as "context risks."
Neither is likely to directly cause the extinction of our species. But
**[both will define the context in which civilization confronts all the
other threats]{.underline}** before us. In this way, [they could
**indirectly** contribute to the **overall danger of
annihilation**]{.underline} --- and this worrisome effect could be
significant. For example, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the effects of climate change will be "severe,"
"pervasive," and "irreversible." Or, as a 2016 study published in Nature
and authored by over twenty scientists puts it, the consequences of
climate change "will extend longer than the entire history of human
civilization thus far." Furthermore, a recent article in Science
Advances confirms that humanity has already escorted the biosphere into
the sixth mass extinction event in life's 3.8 billion year history on
Earth. Yet [another study suggests]{.underline} that [we could be
approaching a **sudden**,]{.underline} **[irreversible]{.underline}**,
catastrophic **[collapse of the global ecosystem]{.underline}**. If this
were to occur, it could result in "widespread social unrest, economic
instability and loss of human life." [Given the **potential** for
environmental degradation to **elevate the likelihood of nuclear
wars**]{.underline}, **[nuclear terrorism]{.underline}**, **[engineered
pandemics]{.underline}**, a **[superintelligence
takeover]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} perhaps even **[an impact
winter]{.underline}**, [it ought to **take precedence over all other
risk concerns**]{.underline} --- at least in the near-term. Let's make
sure we get our priorities straight.

#### Warming is *real*, [anthropogenic]{.underline}, causes extinction 

**McCoy 14** (Dr. David McCoy et al., MD, Centre for International
Health and Development, University College London, "Climate Change and
Human Survival," *British Medical Journal* v. 348, 4-2-14, doi:
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g2510>)

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just published
its report on the impacts of global warming. Building on its recent
update of the physical science of global warming \[1\], [the **IPCC's
new report** should leave the world in no doubt about the **scale** and
**immediacy** of the threat to human survival,]{.underline} health, and
well-being. The IPCC has already concluded that [it is "virtually
certain that **human influence** has warmed the global climate system"
and that it is "extremely likely that more than half of the observed
increase in]{.underline} global average surface
[temperature]{.underline} from 1951 to 2010" [is
**anthropogenic**]{.underline} \[1\]. [Its]{.underline} new [report
outlines the future threats of further global warming: increased
**scarcity of food** and fresh water; **extreme weather** events; **rise
in sea level**; loss of biodiversity; areas becoming uninhabitable; and
mass human migration, conflict and violence.]{.underline} Leaked drafts
talk of hundreds of millions displaced in a little over 80 years. This
month, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
added its voice: "[the well being of people of all nations \[is\] at
risk."]{.underline} \[2\] Such comments reaffirm the conclusions of the
Lancet/UCL Commission: that [climate change is "the greatest threat to
human health of the 21st century."]{.underline} \[3\] The changes seen
so far---massive arctic ice loss and extreme weather events, for
example---have resulted from an estimated average temperature rise of
0.89°C since 1901. [Further changes will **depend** on how much we
continue to heat the planet.]{.underline} The release of just another
275 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide would probably commit us to a
temperature rise of at least 2°C---an amount that could be emitted in
less than eight years. \[4\] [**"Business as usual"** will increase
carbon dioxide concentration]{.underline}**s** from the current level of
400 parts per million (ppm), which is a 40% increase from 280 ppm 150
years ago, to 936 ppm by 2100, with a 50:50 chance that this will
deliver global mean temperature rises of more than 4°C. It is now widely
understood that such a rise is "incompatible with an organised global
community." \[5\]. [The IPCC warns of "tipping points" in the Earth's
system, which, if crossed, could lead to a **catastrophic collapse** of
interlinked human and natural systems]{.underline}. The AAAS concludes
that [there is now a "real chance of abrupt, unpredictable and
potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts on people
around the globe."]{.underline} \[2\] And this week a report from the
World Meteorological Office (WMO) confirmed that extreme weather events
are accelerating. WMO secretary general Michel Jarraud said, "There is
no standstill in global warming . . . The laws of physics are
non-negotiable." \[6\]

### 1AR Renewables Turn -- Warming Not Inevitable 

#### **Climate change isn't inevitable -- filling commitments under Paris are sufficient to avert extinction** 

**Salawitch 17** (Ross J. Salawitch, Professor, Department of
Atmospheric & Oceanic Science and Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry, University of Maryland, with Timothy P. Canty, Austin P.
Hope, Walter R. Tribett, Brian F. Bennett, *Paris Climate Agreement:
Beacon of Hope*, 2017, pp. 87-93)

- \[ΔT was changed to "temperature change"\]

- \***RCP 8.5** - A scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas
  emissions\*

- \*Representative Concentration Pathway (**RCP**) **4.5** is a scenario
  that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 Watts per meter squared in
  the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value\*

One clear message that emerges from Figs. 2.15 and 2.16 is that to
achieve the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, emissions of GHGs must
fall significantly below those used to drive RCP 8.5. The range of
ΔT2100 shown in Fig. 2.16b is 1.6--4.7 °C. **[Climate
catastrophe]{.underline}** ([rapid rise of sea level, large shifts in
patterns of drought and flooding, loss of habitat,]{.underline} etc.)
[will **almost certainly occur** by end of this century if the emissions
of GHGs]{.underline}, particularly CO2, [follow]{.underline} those used
to drive **[RCP 8.5]{.underline}**.32 The book Six Degrees: Our Future
on a Hotter Planet (Lynas 2008) provides an accessible discourse of the
consequences of global warming, organized into 1 °C increments of future
ΔT. In the rest of this chapter, policy relevant projections of ΔT are
shown, both from the EM-GC framework and CMIP5 GCMs. Figures 2.17 shows
the statistical distribution of ΔT2060 from our EM-GC calculations. The
EM-GC based projections are weighted by 1/χ2 (i.e., the better the fit
to the climate record, the more heavily a particular projection is
weighted). The height of each histogram represents the probability that
a particular range of ΔT2060, defined by the width of each line segment,
will occur. In other words, [the most probable value]{.underline} of ΔT
[in]{.underline} year [2060]{.underline}, [for the EM-GC
projection]{.underline} that uses RCP 4.5, [is **1.2--1.3 °C** above
pre-industrial]{.underline}, and there is slightly less than 20 %
probability ΔT will actually fall within this range. In contrast, [the
CMIP5 GCMs project]{.underline} ΔT in [2060 will]{.underline} most
probably [be **2.0--2.2 °C**]{.underline} [warmer than
pre-industrial]{.underline}, with a \~12 % probability ΔT will actually
fall within this range. A finer spacing for ΔT is used for the EM-GC
projection, since [we are able to **conduct many
simulations**]{.underline} [in this model framework]{.underline}. Figure
2.18 is similar to Fig. 2.17, except the projection is for year 2100.
The collection of histograms shown for any particular model (i.e.,
either CMIP5 GCMs or EM-GC) on a specific figure is termed the
probability distribution function (PDF) for the projection of the rise
in GMST (i.e., ΔT). The [PDFs]{.underline} shown in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18
[reveal **stark differences**]{.underline} [in projections]{.underline}
of ΔT [based on the EM-GC framework and the CMIP5 GCMs. **In all
cases**]{.underline}, ΔT \[[temperature change]{.underline}\] [from the
GCMs **far exceed** projections using our]{.underline} relatively simple
[approach]{.underline} that is **[tightly coupled]{.underline}** [to
observed ΔT, OHC, and various natural factors that influence
climate.]{.underline} These differences are quantified in Table 2.1,
which summarizes the cumulative probability that a specific Paris goal
can be achieved. The cumulative probabilities shown in Table 2.1 are
based on summing the height of each histogram that lies to the left of a
specific temperature, in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18. Time series of ΔT found
using the CMIP5 GCM and EM-GC approaches are illustrated in Figs. 2.19
and 2.20, which show projections based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The
colors represent the probability of a particular future value of ΔT
being achieved, for projections computed in the EM-GC framework weighted
by 1/ χ2 . Essentially, the red (warm), white (mid-point), and blue
(cool) colors represent the visualization of a succession of histograms
like those shown in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18. The GCM CMIP5 projections of ΔT
(minimum, maximum, and multi-model mean) for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are
shown by the three grey lines. These lines, identical to those shown in
Fig. 2.3a (RCP 4.5) and Fig. 2.3b (RCP 8.5), are based on our analysis
of GCM output preserved on the CMIP5 archive. The green trapezoid, which
originates from Fig. 11.25b of IPCC (2013), makes a final and rather
important appearance on these figures. Also, the Paris target (1.5 °C)
and upper limit (2 °C) are marked on the right vertical axis of both
figures. [There are **resounding policy implications**]{.underline}
inherent in Figs. 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, and 2.20. First, most importantly,
and beyond debate of any reasonable quantitative analysis of climate,
[if GHG emissions follow anything close to **RCP 8.5,**]{.underline}
[there is **no chance** of achieving either the goal or upper limit of
the Paris climate agreement]{.underline} (Fig. 2.20). Even though there
is a small amount of overlap between the Paris targets and our EM-GC
projections for year 2100 in Fig. 2.20, this is a false hope. In the
highly unlikely event this realization were to actually happen, [it
would just be a matter of time before]{.underline} ΔT \[[temperature

barrier**]{.underline}, [with all of the attendant negative
consequences]{.underline} (Lynas 2008). Plus, of course, 1.5--2.0 °C
warming (i.e., the lead up to breaking the 2 °C barrier) could have
rather severe consequences. This outcome is all but guaranteed if GHG
abundances follow that of RCP 8.5. The second policy implication is that
projections of ΔT found using the EM-GC framework indicate that, [if
emissions of GHGs can be limited to those of **RCP 4.5**, then by
end-century there is]{.underline}: (a) [a **75 %
probability**]{.underline} the Paris target of [1.5 °C
warming]{.underline} above pre-industrial [will be achieved]{.underline}
(b) [a **greater than 95 % probability**]{.underline} the Paris upper
limit of [**2 °C** warming will be achieved]{.underline} As will be

[**provided**: **(1)** both conditional and unconditional **commitments

considerably]{.underline}** [from the consensus]{.underline} in the
climate modeling community [that emission of GHGs must follow RCP 2.6 to
achieve even the 2 °C upper limit of Paris]{.underline} (Rogelj et al.
2016). We caution those quick to dismiss the simplicity of our approach
to consider the emerging view, discussed in Chap. 11 of IPCC (2013) and
quantified in their Figs. 11.25 and TS.14, as well as our Figs. 2.3 and
2.13, that the [CMIP5 GCMs]{.underline} **[warm much
quicker]{.underline}** [than has been observed during the past three
decades]{.underline}. In support of our approach, we emphasize that [our

the]{.underline} green trapezoid of IPCC (2013), which reflects the
**[judgement of]{.underline}** at least one group of [**experts** as to

over the next two decades]{.underline}. Given our present understanding

Study: Emissions Limits Could Avoid Damage By Two-Thirds,"

[The world could **avoid much** of the damaging effects of climate
change]{.underline} this century [if]{.underline} greenhouse gas
[emissions are curbed]{.underline} more **[sharply]{.underline}**,
research showed on Sunday. [The study]{.underline}, [published
in]{.underline} the journal [Nature Climate Change]{.underline}, [**is**
the first comprehensive assessment of the benefits of cutting emissions
to keep the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees]{.underline}
Celsius by 2100, a level which [scientists say would avoid the worst
effects of climate change.]{.underline} It found 20 to [65 percent of
the adverse impacts by the end of this century could be
avoided.]{.underline} \"Our research clearly identifies the benefits of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions - less severe impacts on flooding and
crops are two areas of particular benefit,\" said Nigel Arnell, director
of the University of Reading\'s Walker Institute, which led the study.
In 2010, governments agreed to curb emissions to keep temperatures from
rising above 2 degrees C, but [current emissions reduction targets are
on track to lead to a temperature rise of 4 degrees or more by
2100]{.underline}. The World Bank has warned more extreme weather will
become the \"new normal\" if global temperature rises by 4 degrees.
Extreme heatwaves could devastate areas from the Middle East to the
United States, while sea levels could rise by up to 91 cm (3 feet),
flooding cities in countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, the bank
has said. The latest research involved scientists from British
institutions including the University of Reading, the Met Office Hadley
Centre and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, as well as Germany\'s
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. It examined a range of
emissions-cut scenarios and their impact on factors including flooding,
drought, water availability and crop productivity. [The strictest
scenario kept global temperature rise to 2 degrees C with emissions
peaking in 2016 and declining by 5 percent a year to 2050.]{.underline}
FLOODING Adverse effects such as declining [crop productivity and
exposure to]{.underline} river [flooding could be reduced by 40 to 65
percent by 2100 if warming is limited to 2 degrees]{.underline}, the
study said. Global average sea level rise could be reduced to 30cm (12
inches) by 2100, compared to 47-55cm (18-22 inches) if no action to cut
emissions is taken, it said. Some [adverse]{.underline} climate [impacts
**could also be delayed** by **many decades**]{.underline}. [The global
productivity of spring wheat could drop by 20 percent by the 2050s, but
the fall in yield could be delayed until 2100 if strict emissions curbs
were enforced.]{.underline} \"[Reducing]{.underline} greenhouse gas
[emissions won\'t **avoid** the impacts of climate change
**altogether**]{.underline} of course, [but]{.underline} our research
shows [**it will buy time** to make things like buildings,
transport]{.underline} systems [and ag]{.underline}riculture [**more
resilient** to climate change]{.underline},\" Arnell said.

with a new climate study that seemed to deliver a bombshell conclusion:
the amount of carbon humans have put into the atmosphere may have
already committed the planet 3 to 7 degrees Celsius (5.4 to 12.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) of global warming. [Three to 7 degrees Celsius is a big
amount of warming---an apocalyptically big amount.]{.underline} [The
Paris climate accord, [adopted less than one year
ago](http://gizmodo.com/the-paris-climate-agreement-has-been-adopted-1747460706)
by nearly 200 nations, resolved to slash global carbon emissions so that
we don't exceed 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming
overall. If we've **already blown that target**, not only is humanity's
landmark climate agreement[depressingly

and [many of our planet's coastal

are doomed.]{.underline} **[Here's the good news: prominent experts are
calling this a load of malarkey]{.underline}**. "**[This is simply
wrong]{.underline}**," [Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard
Institute for Space Studies, told Gizmodo]{.underline}.
"[The]{.underline} **[actual]{.underline}** [committed warming is **only
0.5**]{.underline} [to perhaps 1 \[degree
Celsius]{.underline}\]---**[and nothing in the study changes
that]{.underline}**." The new study, which [appears
today](http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19798) in
Nature, is a reconstruction of Earth's average surface temperature over
the past two million years. To produce it, Stanford's Carolyn Snyder
assembled dozens of sea surface temperature records that researchers
around the world developed from ocean sediment cores. Doing so was no
easy feat: "[The communities that produce these data are notoriously
cagey about releasing it]{.underline}," Schmidt said, adding that Snyder
"did a big amount of work putting together disparate data" in what will
no doubt prove a valuable resource for the climate science community.
And yet, "Scientist Compiles Dozens of Datasets to Reconstruct Two
Million Years of Global Average Surface Temperatures," is hardly a sexy
headline. The study might have flown under the public radar, except for
a section toward the end, where Snyder used her new dataset to estimate
the sensitivity of Earth's surface temperature to levels of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. When Synder compared her temperature record
with a record of atmospheric CO2 over the last two million years, she
found a strongly positive, linear relationship between the two. From the
slope of that relationship, she determined that a doubling of
atmospheric CO2 levels translates to a 9 degree Celsius change in global
average surface temperatures, give or take four degrees. Snyder dubbed
this amount the "Earth system sensitivity" (ESS). "This research follows
previous work in the literature that defined the correlation
relationship between global temperature and greenhouse gas radiative
forcing changes as ESS or S\[ghg\] as a way to summarize patterns in the
Earth's past climate," Snyder told Gizmodo. **[Here's where things get
hairy]{.underline}**. [Since humans have increased global CO2 levels
roughly 40 percent since the start of the industrial revolution, Snyder
decided to use her correlation from the past to project forward in time:
"This \[Earth system sensitivity\] result suggests that stabilization at
today's greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual
total warming of 5 degrees Celsius," she writes in the study's abstract.
Using a past relationship to say something about the future is not
illogical]{.underline}. [The problem lies in the details of the complex
relationship between climate and CO2]{.underline}. We know that as
atmospheric CO2 levels have risen and fallen throughout Earth's history,
the planet's temperature has changed. We know that when temperatures
change, ice sheets to retreat and advance. Animals and plants flourish
and die off; the amount of dust in the atmosphere rises and falls. All
of these changes, which climate scientists call "Earth-system
**[feedbacks]{.underline}**" **[trigger more climate
change]{.underline}**, [further altering the level of CO2 in the
atmosphere.]{.underline} ["You have this chicken and egg situation,
where ice changes, which causes CO2 to change, which causes ice to
change, and so on and so forth," Schmidt said. When you do a correlation
between a temperature and CO2 over a long enough timescale, all of these
feedbacks get smeared together]{.underline}. As Schmidt put it, "you're
mixing the impact of CO2 on climate, and climate on CO2." In other
words, the "Earth system sensitivity" cannot be interpreted as the
direct impact of atmospheric CO2 on global temperatures, as [some media
outlets](http://www.businessinsider.com/2-million-year-record-earths-climate-2016-9)
are now reporting. In principle, CO2 doesn't have to impact climate at
all in order to see a positive correlation. "Simply correlating the
temperature with the CO2 level would tell you climate sensitivity only
if you knew that CO2 changes explained the vast majority of the
temperature changes," Ken Caldeira, a climatologist at the Carnegie
Institution for Science told Gizmodo. "However, we don't know that. So,
the climate sensitivity numbers reported in this paper should be
regarded as an upper bound on possible 'Earth System' climate
sensitivity. Real 'Earth System' climate sensitivity is likely
substantially lower." In all fairness, Snyder said that it was not her
intention to make a prediction about how human carbon emissions will
impact future climate. "This research cannot and does not provide a
forecast or prediction for future climate change," she said. "All we can
say is, if we take the past relationship \[between temperature and CO2\]
and translate it forward, this is what we get." [Unfortunately, the
nuances and criticisms I've outlined above weren't made clear enough in
the study's abstract, nor did they make it into a Nature [press
release](http://press.nature.com/?post_type=press_release&p=58351)
issued under embargo last week, which repackaged what was a minor point
of the new research into a dramatic punchline]{.underline}. [The planet
is **definitely warming, and human carbon emissions are definitely to
blame. But** ten degrees or more of **guaranteed future heat? We still
have time to prevent that.**]{.underline}

#### Even if [some]{.underline} climate change is locked in, rapid mitigation now [prevents catastrophic impacts]{.underline} -- adaptation alone fails 

**Pancost 16** (Professor Rich Pancost, organic geochemist,
biogeochemist and palaeoclimatologist. Director of the interdisciplinary
University of Bristol Cabot Institute, August 2, 2016. "Climate Change:
Mitigation or adaptation?"
https://preventablesurprises.com/blog/climate-change-mitigation-or-adaptation/)

Now, as then, [the sole focus on **adaptation is deeply
flawed**]{.underline}. [Let's start with those arguing that either the
mitigation opportunity has passed by or that nations will be unwilling
to enact the perceived painful policies necessary to limit
warming]{.underline}. [Aside from the ethical flaws of this
argument]{.underline}, [it would be **naive**]{.underline} for investors
[to assume that an agreement among nearly 200 nations will have no legal
or policy consequences]{.underline}; even the INDCs, though they are
incomplete measures, will require vast social, economic, and political
change. However, [the]{.underline} central [argument that]{.underline}
**[mitigation remains vital and necessary is scientific]{.underline}**.
[Those suggesting that mitigation has failed or will fail tend to fixate
on the 2°C global warming limit at the centre of policy discussions for
the past decade and the acute challenge we face in achieving
it]{.underline}. [There are good reasons to have a 2°C (or lower) limit,
as that is the representative temperature when a number of system
changes begin to occur, very high sea level rise becomes locked in, and
changes in weather, including extreme events, becomes very difficult to
predict, all of which will have dramatic economic and social
impacts]{.underline}. [Climate change]{.underline}, however, **[is not a
binary]{.underline}**. [We are]{.underline} **[already
experiencing]{.underline}** the consequences of
[anthropogenic]{.underline} climate [disruption]{.underline}. [These
will become more pronounced as the planet approaches 2°C of warming. And
they will become even worse at higher CO2 levels and higher global
temperatures]{.underline}. [The Earth system does have some bimodal
features but the tipping points between them occur at a range of
temperatures, with great uncertainty, and in complex ways]{.underline}.
Sea level rise showcases this well. In the Pliocene era, about 3 million
years ago, CO2 levels were 400 to 500 ppm; temperatures were 2°C higher;
and the sea level was 5 to 20 metres higher than today. Such changes
would be devastating in modern times, with huge infrastructure costs,
long-term economic consequences, and unprecedented social displacement.
The last time Earth experienced 500 to 1000 ppm CO2, however,
temperatures were about 4-5°C higher, and sea level was 70-100 metres
higher than today. These represent a long-term Earth system equilibrium
so neither scenario is expected for the next several hundred years or
more; but they are illustrative of the profound differences between a
2°C and 5°C global warming scenario. Crucially,
**[unabated]{.underline}** biomass loss and **[fossil fuel
burning]{.underline}**---especially with new technologies allowing
unconventional shale gas and tar sands to be exploited---could [result
in warming of]{.underline} 5 to **[6°C]{.underline}**, [maybe even more
depending on how effective we are at tapping new reservoirs, whether
climate sensitivity is at the high or low end of our estimates, and
whether positive feedbacks in the Earth system will exacerbate our
fossil fuel impacts]{.underline}. To the best of our understanding, 5 to
6°C global warming will have vast and devastating impacts on our climate
and ecosystems, probably with similarly devastating impacts on society.
In short, [**even if we fail** to sufficiently curtail fossil fuel usage
to limit global warming to 2°C, **we must certainly** do so to prevent
**far more extreme warming**]{.underline}. As long as fossil fuel
resources exist to tempt us, **[mitigation will always be a
priority]{.underline}**. And yet. Even under our most ambitious
mitigation strategies, [climate change will happen and we must adapt to
it.]{.underline} Already, with the Earth having experienced only about
1°C warming, droughts, floods and heat waves---many of which have been
directly attributed to global warming---are occurring. When that warming
has combined with natural climate variability, which happened with the
strong El Niño of this past year, local affects are even more
pronounced, whether it be global coral bleaching or crippling heat waves
in the tropics. These events, in turn, have affected food security,
productivity and global security. They could destroy marine ecosystems
and in turn one of our most important food sources and one of nature's
most beautiful features. And yet, we are committed to further emissions,
further warming, and further climate disruption. It is hoped that **[if
we limit warming]{.underline}** to 1.5°C, [the most severe
aspects]{.underline} of sea level rise, extreme weather and ecosystem
disruption **[will be avoided]{.underline}**---but we do not know that
and some have argued that we have already locked in up to 4 metres of
sea level rise. If we limit warming to 2°C, we will almost certainly
have to adapt to sea level rise, human displacement, infrastructure
devastation; it will also expose us to feedback risks that could add
additional warming beyond our direct influence. **[There is no choice
between avoiding severe climate disruption or adapting to it. We will do
both]{.underline}**. We will leave fossil fuel assets in the ground and
we will adapt to some environmental disruption. [The only choices we
have are]{.underline} how we balance those two needs, how we do so
fairly, and **[how rapidly we make the inevitable
transition]{.underline}**.

### 1AR Renewables Turn -- Warming is Real

#### Warming is [real]{.underline}, [anthropogenic]{.underline}, and [rapidly accelerating]{.underline} towards [extinction]{.underline} -- emission cuts are [crucial]{.underline} 

**Weart 17** (Spencer Weart, Director of the Center for History of
Physics of the American Institute of Physics (AIP) in College, B.A. in

citing data from over 63 independent sources and several decades,
including prominent NASA scientists, January 2017. "The Carbon Dioxide
Greenhouse Effect." http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm)

During the 1990s, further [ice core measurements indicated that at the
end of the last glacial period, the initial rise of temperature in
Antarctica had preceded CO2 changes by several centuries]{.underline}.
Some scientists doubted that dates could be measured so precisely, but
as as better cores were extracted the data increasingly pointed to a
time lag.[(53a\*)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_53a_) This
surprised and confused many people. If changes in CO2 began after
changes in temperature, didn't that contradict the greenhouse theory of
global warming? But in fact the lag was not good news. It seemed that
rises or falls in carbon dioxide levels had not initiated the glacial
cycles. In fact most scientists had long since abandoned that
hypothesis. In the 1960s, painstaking studies had shown that subtle
shifts in our planet\'s orbit around the Sun (called \"Milankovitch
cycles\") matched the timing of ice ages with startling precision. The
amount of sunlight that fell in a given latitude and season varied
predictably over millenia. As some had pointed out ever since the 19th
century, in times when sunlight fell more strongly on northern latitudes
in the spring, snow and sea ice would not linger so long; the dark earth
and seawater would absorb more sunlight, and get warmer. However,
calculations showed that this subtle effect should cause no more than a
small regional warming. How could almost imperceptible changes in the
angle of sunlight cause entire continental ice sheets to build up and
melt away? The **[new ice cores]{.underline}** [suggest]{.underline}ed
that [a **powerful feedback**]{.underline} amplified the changes in
sunlight. The crucial fact was that a **[slight warming]{.underline}**
[would cause]{.underline} the level of
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse
**[g]{.underline}**ase**[s]{.underline}** [to rise]{.underline}
slightly. For one thing, warmer oceans would evaporate out more gas. For
another, as the vast Arctic tundras warmed up, the bogs would emit more
CO2(and another greenhouse gas, methane, also measured in the ice with a
lag behind temperature). The greenhouse effect of these gases would
raise the temperature a little more, which would cause more emission of
gases, which would\... and so forth, hauling the planet step by step
into a warm period. Many thousands of years later, the process would
reverse when the sunlight falling in key latitudes weakened. Bogs and
oceans would absorb greenhouse gases, ice would build up, and the planet
would slide back into an ice age. This finally explained how tiny shifts
in the Earth\'s orbit could set the timing of the enormous swings of
glacial cycles. Or, more ominously, how a change in the gas level
initiated by humanity might be amplified through a temperature feedback
loop. The ancient ice ages were the reverse of our current situation,
where humanity was initiating the change by adding greenhouse gases. As
the gas level rose, temperature would rise with a time lag --- although
only a few decades, not centuries, for the rates of change were now
enormously faster than the orbital shifts that brought ice ages. There
were many ways temperature or other climate features could influence the
carbon dioxide level one way or another. Perhaps variations of
temperature and of weather patterns caused land vegetation to release
extra CO2, or take it up\... perhaps the oceans were involved through
massive changes in their circulation or ice cover\... or through changes
in their CO2-absorbing plankton, which would bloom or decline insofar as
they were fertilized by minerals, which reached them from dusty winds,
rivers, and ocean upwelling, all of which could change with the
climate\... or perhaps there were still more complicated and obscure
effects. Into the 21st century, scientists kept finding new ways that
warming would push more of the gas into the atmosphere. As one of them
remarked, \"it is difficult to explain the demise of the ice sheets
without the added heating from CO2 \... this gas has killed ice sheets
in the past and may do so again.\"(54) **[A key point stood
out]{.underline}**. The cycling of carbon through living systems was not
something to trifle with. In the network of feedbacks that made up the
climate system, [CO2 was a main driving force]{.underline}. This did not
prove by itself that the greenhouse effect was responsible for the
warming seen in the 20th century. And it did not say how much warming
the rise of CO2 might bring in the future. **[What was now beyond
doubt]{.underline}** [was that the greenhouse effect had to be taken
**very seriously**]{.underline}
indeed.[(55)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_55_) The Computer
Models Vindicated (1990s-2000s) By now there were a dozen teams around
the world using computers to integrate every advance in observation or
theory. As the 21st century arrived, the growing agreement among the
rival teams, and the **[consistency]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
their [model]{.underline}s\' [results]{.underline} [with many different
kinds of observations]{.underline}, [became **overwhelmingly
convincing**]{.underline}. [**No model** that could simulate the
Earth\'s climate --- and some of the simulations had become very good
indeed --- **failed to show warming** if its greenhouse gas level was
raised]{.underline}. [Scarcely **any expert**]{.underline} with a record
of contributing to climate science now **[doubted]{.underline}** [that
CO2]{.underline} and other greenhouse gases [were]{.underline} at least
partly [responsible for]{.underline} the **[unprecedented
warming]{.underline}** all around the world since the 1970s. **[A final
nail in the coffin of scientific skepticism]{.underline}** came in 2005,
[when a team compiled]{.underline} **[accurate long-term
measurements]{.underline}** [of temperatures]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} all [the]{.underline} world\'s **[ocean]{.underline}**
basins. It was not in the air but the massive oceans, after all, that
most of any heat added would soon wind up. Indeed natural fluctuations
had kept air temperatures roughly the same since the late 1990s; the
significant question was whether the oceans were continuing to warm.
[The team found that over many decades the planet\'s content of
heat-energy had been rising, and was rising still (this continued
steadily after 2005 as well). There was only one remotely plausible
source of the colossal addition of energy: the Earth must be taking in
more energy from sunlight than it was radiating back into
space]{.underline}. Simple physics calculated that to heat all that sea
water required nearly an extra watt per square meter, averaged over the
planet\'s entire surface, year after year. The number was just what the
elaborate greenhouse effect computations had been predicting for
decades. James **[Hansen]{.underline}**, leader of one of the studies,
[called the **visible increase**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the
planet\'s [heat]{.underline} [content]{.underline} **[a \"smoking gun\"
proof of greenhouse effect warming]{.underline}** (see
[graph](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#oceanheat)below).
[Moreover, in each separate ocean basin there was a close match between
the pattern of rising temperatures measured at each location and depth
and detailed model calculations of where the greenhouse effect warming
should appear]{.underline}. Warming from other sources, for example a
change in the Sun\'s output, could not produce these patterns. Evidently
the modelers were on the right
track.[(56)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_56_) Yet amid all
the uncertainties about how carbon cycles operated, how much could we
trust the computer models to work under circumstances different from the
present? Scientists are more likely to believe something if they can
confirm it with entirely independent lines of evidence, preferably from
somewhere nobody had looked before. Just such new evidence came up in
the 1990s, thanks to an unexpected alliance of paleontology and plant
physiology. Studies of plant species that had changed little since the
rise of the dinosaurs (magnolia for one) showed that if you exposed them
to a higher level of CO2, the structure of their leaves changed. Ancient
fossil leaves showed just such changes. Several kinds of chemical
studies of ancient rocks and soils helped pin down how the level of the
gas had swung widely over geological ages, and the temperature too. [A
**sustained effort**]{.underline} [by many **geochemists** and their
allies managed to get numbers for the \"climate sensitivity\" in past
eras, that is, the response of temperature to a rise in the CO2
level]{.underline}. [Over hundreds of millions of years, a doubled level
of the gas had always gone along with a temperature rise of three
degrees, give or take a degree. That was in **startling agreement** with
the range of numbers coming from **many computer studies**. Evidently
the computer modelers had not missed anything important.]{.underline} It
was reassuring that there seemed scant possibility of a Venus-style
runaway greenhouse apocalypse. It was less reassuring to see what the
climate had looked like in the ancient eras when CO2 had stood at a high
level --- a level that humanity would eventually reach if we went on
burning all available oil and coal. The Earth had been virtually a
different planet, with tropical forests near the poles and sea levels a
hundred meters higher. To be sure, it would take many thousands of years
to melt entire polar ice caps. But in the meantime **[even a modest sea
level rise would disrupt humanity\'s teeming coastal
populations]{.underline}**. And as many scientists pointed out, **[if
humanity\'s emissions continued]{.underline}** [they seem]{.underline}ed
[**bound to bring** not only]{.underline} \"[a]{.underline} **[warming
unprecedented]{.underline}** in the past million years,\"
**[but]{.underline}** changes \"**[much faster]{.underline}** [than
previously experienced by natural
ecosystems]{.underline}\...\"[(57)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_57_)
[By 2010, **new studies** had pinned down some truly disturbing numbers
about eras in the distant past when CO2 levels had been high ---
although no higher than we would reach by the late 21st century if
emissions continued to rise **without restriction**]{.underline}. In
those eras global temperatures had been at least three degrees higher
than at present, and perhaps as much as six degrees higher, that is, in
the upper range of what computer models found plausible, if not higher
still. For the real planet, a rise in temperature had evidently not been
limited by increased cloud reflection or the like. The rise had instead
apparently been **[amplified]{.underline}** by **[positive
feedbacks]{.underline}**, [as ice and oceans and vegetation responded
over centuries to the changing conditions with darker surfaces and their
own gas emissions]{.underline}. The computer models did not take these
slow feedback loops into account. Hansen and others argued that humanity
risked [setting off a]{.underline} chain [reaction that would

strict policies to restrict greenhouse gas emissions.]{.underline}**
(All, that is, except a few self-appointed panels composed primarily of

[were]{.underline} almost **[unanimously in agreement]{.underline}**
with the consensus in its broad outlines --- to be precise, **[97%
agreed with it]{.underline}**. But they continued to argue vehemently

**every apparent discrepancy**]{.underline}. They published long lists
of **[scientists who denied]{.underline}** [there was any
problem]{.underline} --- a[lthough the lists included **hardly any
scientist who had made significant contributions to climate
research**]{.underline}.[(58\*)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_58_)
Debate over policies to restrict emissions grew increasingly intense.
Prospects for the 21st Century Through all these discoveries and
controversies, Keeling and his colleagues had kept on quietly monitoring
and analyzing the ongoing changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. Since the
1980s, a cooperative international program had been measuring the gas at
land stations around the world and along shipping lanes. The baseline
continued to rise ominously, but not smoothly. There had been years when
the world\'s atmosphere had gained one billion metric tonnes of the gas,
while in other years it gained as much as six billion. How much did
changes in the world\'s industries and agricultural practices affect the
rate of the rise? Economic statistics allowed a good reckoning of how
much gas humanity emitted in burning fossil fuels --- and also of some
significance, in the manufacture of cement --- but the effects of
deforestation and other land use changes were not so easy to figure. How
much did changes in the level of CO2 reflect changes in the growth or
decay of plants, perhaps related to climate fluctuations? What could one
learn from the way the curve reacted to temporary climate changes
brought on by volcanic eruptions, by the El Niño events that temporarily
pumped heat in or out of the Pacific Ocean, and so
forth?[(59)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_59_) Further clues
came from world-wide measurements of other biologically active gases,
especially oxygen (the exacting techniques for measuring the tiny
variations were pioneered by Keeling\'s son, Ralph Keeling). Most of the
\"missing\" carbon was finally located, with gradually increasing
precision, in rapidly changing forests and forest soils, along with
other biological
reservoirs.[(59a)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_59a_)
Another marker of biological activity was the rare isotope carbon-13.
Plants take less of it from the atmosphere than the lighter isotope
carbon-12, so the latter is over-represented in coal and oil. The
fraction of the lighter isotope in the air was increasing, proving (to a
lingering band of skeptics) that the rise in CO2 came from humanity\'s
use of fossil fuel, not from a mineral source such as
volcanoes.[(60)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_60_) Meanwhile
the level of CO2 in the air kept rising, indeed faster than anyone had
expected. Over the half-century up to 2010, humanity\'s output of CO2
had quadrupled. The amount taken up by the oceans and land reservoirs
had meanwhile stayed steady at about half (to be exact, 55%) of the
emissions.[(60a)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_60a_) In this
essay we have seen how, ever since the late 1950s, [an increasing number
of experts predicted that effects on climate would become clearly
visible around the year 2000. **They were right**]{.underline}. As the
21st century began, the global temperature was soaring in a way never
seen before. (The surface air temperature rise temporarily paused, but
the oceans, where most of the heat was stored, were rapidly warming.)
Worse, **[field evidence showed]{.underline}** that the expected
[feedbacks were **kicking in**]{.underline}. The world\'s plants were
taking up more CO2, but their capacity to absorb was waning. Warmer
oceans were absorbing less CO2, and gas was seen bubbling from melting
Arctic tundra. In sum, global warming was leading to more greenhouse
emissions, which would lead to more warming\... and so forth. Starting
around 2008 some scientists began to warn that these changes were coming
on faster than the international panels had predicted. \"**[I have yet
to meet a climate scientist,\" one of them remarked in 2012, \"who does
not believe that global warming is a worse problem than they thought a
few]{.underline}** **[years
ago]{.underline}**.\"[(61)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_61_)
Also as predicted only sooner, [the world was beginning to suffer
historically unprecedented heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. The
sea level was rising while mountain glaciers, the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets, and Arctic sea ice melted back, all at
accelerating rates. Important ecosystems from alpine meadows to coral
reefs were showing signs of stress]{.underline}. For the scientists, as
one of them remarked, \"Seeing their own predictions come true has been
a frightening
experience.\"[(62)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_62_) Some
researchers turned from predicting future warming to identifying how far
some of the extreme weather events of the 2000\'s could already be
attributed to human-caused climate change. Still more sobering, people
were scarcely coming to grips with the implications of a fact that
scientists had known for decades --- the climate system has built-in
time lags. The passionate policy controversies and even much of the
scientific research had been preoccupied with the warming of a degree or
two (at a minimum) expected by the end of the 21st century. But already
in the 1970s, climate scientists had understood that even if emissions
could magically be brought immediately to zero, the oceans\' uptake of
CO2 was so slow that the gas already in the air would linger for
centuries, trapping more heat. For example, in a milestone 1977 US
National Academy of Sciences report, Keeling and a colleague had
reported that the decline of the level of CO2 in the atmosphere would
take centuries. But scientists had rarely emphasized this to the public,
and many people thought that if emissions could be reined in the problem
would be solved. The situation turned out to be even worse than
scientists had supposed. A definitive report published in 2005 by the
prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated only
that, \"While more than half of the CO2 emitted is currently removed
from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20%) of
emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere for many millennia.\" That implied
that a large part of global warming would dwindle away within a century
after emissions ceased. Wrong. It turned out that the 21st-century level
of emissions was so massive that it was transforming the entire global
carbon system into a new state. Global temperatures would continue to
creep upward until the ocean depths and their chemistry reached
equilibrium with the heated air, until biological systems finished
adapting to the new conditions, and until Arctic icecaps melted back to
their own equilibrium. Journal articles pointing out this situation
first appeared in 2007-2008. The new understanding was incorporated in
the IPCC\'s 2014 report, which warned, \"Surface temperatures will
remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries
after a complete cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\" Whatever we
did now, humanity was already committed to centuries of violently
changing weather and rising seas, followed by millennia in the new,
heated state.[(63\*)](http://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm#N_63_) The
public was scarcely aware of this. Emissions of greenhouse gases, far
from halting, were soaring at an accelerating rate. The basic physics
and chemistry of the problems raised by Tyndall were now well in hand.
There were reliable calculations of the direct effects of CO2 on
radiation, of how the gas was dissolved in sea water, and other physical
phenomena. Further progress would center on understanding the complex
interactions of the entire planetary system, and especially interactions
with living creatures. The creatures who would count the most were
humans. [The climate]{.underline} a century hence would **[depend
chiefly]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} what they chose to do about
their **[emissions]{.underline}**. If the planet warmed up by several
degrees during the 21st century, as **[paleontologists and computer
modelers agreed]{.underline}** was likely, what would be the
consequences? This became the new center for much of the research.
**[Extensive studies]{.underline}** [showed]{.underline} that [the
consequences of a two degree rise would be **severe**]{.underline} in
many parts of the world --- and such a rise was more likely than not by
the late 21st century, even if governments began to take serious action
to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. And **[if we did not act promptly
and forcefully? It was even odds that by the end of the century we would
face an unprecedented and grievous degradation of many of the ecosystems
on which civilization depends]{.underline}**.

Russia. I believe that [today US-Russian relations are as bad as in the
dark days of the Cold War]{.underline}. How could this have happened?
During the 1990s: · The Soviet Union dissolved. · The US tried to bring
Russia into the western security circle. · We jointly dismantled 8,000
nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and in the United States. ·
We jointly agreed to honor Ukraine's boundaries. · Russia was invited to
and attended NATO meetings and participated in NATO peacekeeping
exercises. · And most significantly, Russia embedded a brigade into an
American division in the Bosnian peace-keeping operation. That was then.
But what about now? [Today the picture is very different:]{.underline} ·
[Russia violated the agreement on Ukraine.]{.underline} · **[Russia has
threatened its neighbors and the US with nuclear weapons]{.underline}**,
[with a statement]{.underline} made by a commentator on
government-controlled television who said: ["Russia is the only country
capable of turning the US into radioactive ash."]{.underline} ·
**[Russia has rejected its former policy of "no first
use,"]{.underline}** [in favor of an aggressive policy that]{.underline}
[proclaims]{.underline} that, if threatened, [nuclear weapons will be
their weapon of choice]{.underline}. · [To back up that threat, Russia
has embarked on a **major buildup of their nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}, [with a whole new generation of
carriers]{.underline}---intercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise
missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear submarines.
We know less about what they are doing on the bombs themselves, but [it
seems likely that they are developing new bombs with new
characteristics]{.underline}. · Their nuclear weapons designers believe
they need a new round of nuclear tests for these new weapons, but we do
not know what Putin's views are on this. · Even though the technical
arguments are strong, he has to consider the political arguments for not
testing, and he has stated privately to a few interlocutors that he felt
the political reasons for not testing were compelling. But in fact we
cannot be sure, and he could decide to test, perhaps as early as next
year, with the excuse that since the US never ratified the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, Russia is relieved of its responsibility to continue
honoring it. · **[Putin has spoken menacingly about their nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**---[especially menacing is the Russian emphasis on
so-called tactical nuclear weapons, i.e., nuclear weapons intended not
for deterrence but for war fighting. I am painting a grim picture, but I
think **it is not overstated.**]{.underline} It is certainly worth
asking how we got into this mess, and how can we get out of it.
Certainly [part of the problem is of Putin's own making]{.underline}, as
a part of his move to consolidate and sustain his power in Russia. But
part of the problem we brought on ourselves: · By a premature expansion
of NATO in the late 1990s, when Russia still saw NATO as a potential
threat. · By then threatening to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO. ·
By a European deployment of a ballistic missile defense system that
Russia saw as threatening its deterrent force. · And by supporting color
revolutions in Russia's neighborhood; most important, Putin seems to
believe that we have been actively seeking to stimulate a color
revolution that would overthrow his regime. [In response to these
perceived threats, **Putin began playing a very aggressive
game**]{.underline}. But [except for his nuclear weapons, he is playing
it from a weak hand.]{.underline} · [Russia is facing a serious
demographic problem]{.underline}, with its population actually
decreasing. · It has a serious problem of alcoholism, contributing to a
remarkably low life expectancy for Russian men. · [Russia is in a
**precarious economic posture**]{.underline}---[it is basically a
**petro state** that failed to diversify during the boom oil years, and
now it is probably too late]{.underline}. [A **large part** of the
Russian government's budget comes from **oil revenues**. When oil drops
**below \$80 a barrel**, they are **in trouble**; **at \$50 a barrel,
they are in BIG trouble**]{.underline}. [They have been **eating into
cash reserves for more than a year**]{.underline}; [another year or
two]{.underline} of \$50 a barrel, [and their reserves will be
**seriously depleted**. These problems, **paradoxically, make Russia
more dangerous, not less dangerous**. Putin's primary **legitimacy** is
based on Russia's **economic wellbeing**.]{.underline} Thus **[a weak
economy threatens his regime]{.underline}**. [If Putin is unable to fix
his economic problems, as seems likely, **he can divert attention by
playing the nationalistic card.**]{.underline} [Judging from the
popularity of his ultra-nationalistic moves, this is all too
successful.]{.underline} But [the **danger** is that he might overplay
his hand and **blunder into a shooting war**]{.underline}, [a shooting
war that **Russia would surely lose unless they used their nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}---that is, [unless they do just what they say
they will do! And that is my nightmare scenario.]{.underline}

### 1AR Russia Turn -- High Oil Prices Key

Some of [the effects of]{.underline} this **[decline]{.underline}** [in
oil prices have been]{.underline} clear and immediate; picture happy
Americans at gas stations and **[frantic]{.underline}** government
officials [in oil-exporting countries]{.underline} forced to cut public

prices have **fallen**]{.underline}, [the Central Bank's reserves are
**shrinking**]{.underline}, [capital is **fleeing** the
country]{.underline}, [export revenues are **down**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [foreign investment has practically **dried
up**]{.underline}. [Russia's sovereign bonds have been **downgraded to
junk status**]{.underline} by credit-rating agencies. [**All** of
this]{.underline} largely [stems from]{.underline}
**[contracting]{.underline}** [**[oil]{.underline}** and gas
**[revenues]{.underline}**](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=17231)
([which account for **68 percent** of Russia's]{.underline} total
[export revenues]{.underline} and **[50 percent]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [its **federal-budget**]{.underline} revenues) and
economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe as a result
of the Kremlin's behavior toward Ukraine. Some fear that [a

#### Lower oil revenue [doesn't]{.underline} cause Russian capitulation -- they'll just intervene [militarily]{.underline} which causes [escalating crisis]{.underline}

**Jaffe** and Elass **16** \[Amy Myers Jaffe and Jareer Elass, Columbia
Journal of International Fails. War and the Oil Price Cycle. January 1,

[While **low oil prices** have forced Moscow to take **draconian
economic steps**]{.underline}, so far [it has **not**]{.underline}
fundamentally [**produced** the desired **diplomatic
capitulation**]{.underline}. As predicted by Robert Blackwill and Meghan
O'Sullivan, "... [a **weaker Russia** will **not** necessarily **mean**
a **less challenging Russia**]{.underline}...[Russia could seek to
**secure** its regional **influence** in **more direct
ways**]{.underline} --even [through the projection of **military
power**]{.underline}."48 Indeed, [U.S.]{.underline} summer [diplomatic
efforts fizzled quickly]{.underline} by autumn, [with Russia changing
the facts on the ground through **direct Russian military
intervention**]{.underline}. Russia's motivations are multifold and
certainly include protecting its substantial interests in Syria
including its preferred outcome that maintains Syria as an Iranian
bulwark against Sunni jihadists.49 Some analysts are suggesting that
Moscow is overly optimistic about defeating Syrian opposition groups.
Instead, it is suggested that Russia's previous difficulties during its
invasion of Afghanistan may prove instructive, with all Syrian
opposition forces still focusing in earnest on the Assad camp, and
saving energies against each other for a later day.50 However, it is
still not clear as this article went to press whether Russia intends to
satisfy the Saudis by participating in peace negotiations, or whether
the Russian engagement on behalf of Assad is meant to hold Iran and
Moscow in a position to use Syria to assert themselves against the
kingdom and restore oil prices. While the outcome in Syria is uncertain,
[the Russian move]{.underline} clearly complicates the landscape in the
region, and [**leaves open** the **possibility** of **escalating
violence**]{.underline}. Pavel Baev and Jeremy Shapiro of Brookings
suggest [Russia's increased intervention may simply be designed to
"**establish** a **position of strength** from which to **bring Moscow
back** into the center]{.underline} of diplomacy over Syria,"51 but they
are skeptical that Russia will be able to manage its participation in
the conflict to reach a desired goal. Russia may also have broader
goals, including intimidating U.S. allies both in the region and in
Europe, to influence oil policy over the longer term, as well as to
weaken strategic alliances that could be used against Russia, its
national interests or the interests of individuals in the current
regime. In recent years, Russia has acted to reassert itself on the
world stage both through military means and by tapping energy as a
weapon for leverage to enhance its geopolitical status.52

[**capitulation** would "**erode** a lot of **his power**]{.underline}."

Russia's currency and economy are crumbling along with oil prices, the
country's main export and revenue source. On Monday, the ruble suffered
its worst one-day decline since 1998, and it looks like Russia's economy
will tip into recession next year.

Russia has had a hard time since the [**collapse** of global **oil
prices**]{.underline} which began in August 2014. This will continue in
2017. The Russian people are starting to feel the effects of prolonged
low oil prices. This was bound to happen. And this [will **shape
Moscow\'s foreign policy**]{.underline} in the year to come.

**[Russia's]{.underline}** money problems start with the economy's
structure. The country's [**budget** **depends** on **income** from
**oil exports**]{.underline}. Low oil prices have had huge effects. And
the country hasn't even recovered from the 2008 decline.

Little to [**no investment** was made in industrial
**alternatives**]{.underline}. And almost [**no money** was used to
increase **efficiency**]{.underline} or to add new technology.

Low oil prices hurt

Signs of bad times started being seen [in]{.underline} late
**[2012]{.underline}**. [Russia's 2016 budget had planned for oil prices
at \$50 per barrel]{.underline}, and the deficit target was set at 3
percent. The [drop in oil prices means **less income**]{.underline}. And
[that means the **budget will not be met**]{.underline}.

[Russia]{.underline} can't control the price of oil. So, it [needs to
find other ways to manage its budget. So far, this includes
**cut**]{.underline}s [in **government spending**]{.underline}
(**[except]{.underline}** in **[defense]{.underline}** and social
services). And there are plans to privatize some state-owned companies.

Prolonged low oil prices have had an impact on Russia\'s economy. GDP
per capita in Russia is down from an all-time high of \$11,615 in 2013
to \$11,038 in 2015. Wages fell by 9 percent in 2015. And more than 2
million people fell into poverty.

In the first three months of 2016, inflation fell from 12.9 percent to
7.4 percent. That is the factor that worries Russia the most. Still, the
central bank refused to cut the interest rate. At the same time, wages
rose more than 5 percent. This is the first time since 2014 they have
surpassed the rate of inflation.

And the people are suffering

[The big danger]{.underline} for Russia, though[, is how the oil price
problem is **affecting people**]{.underline}. **[Wages]{.underline}**
over the last two years [have had **no real growth**]{.underline}. The
**[poverty]{.underline}** level has **[increased]{.underline}**. Now
[there are reports of **food** costing 50 percent or more of a person\'s
income]{.underline}. People are starting to grow some of their own food
so they can still eat some of what they can't afford to buy in stores.

As a result, [**Russians' despair** has grown]{.underline}. A rising
number of small, local [**protests** have occurred]{.underline}. [These
often relate to specific **economic issues**, particularly
pensions]{.underline}. The number of protests in big cities has
declined, but protests in small cities have increased by 40 percent in
the last year---according to the FNPR, the country's largest workers'
association.

Making things worse are [reports of **wage arrears**]{.underline} in
different regions. These reports [are becoming **more
common**]{.underline}. Wage arrears in Russia totaled 3.8 billion rubles
(\$62 million) as of July 1, 2016. About a quarter of these delayed
payments were the past month\'s pay for workers. About 30 percent,
though, dated back to 2014 or 2013.

Reports of **[bankruptcies]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} also [on the
rise]{.underline}. One of the most troubling cases thus far deals with
UralVagonZavod (UVZ). This is a corporation that consists of 40 entities
and is among the world's top 100 largest military-industrial companies.
Three entities---Alfa-Bank, Barnaul Forge and Press Plant, and Central
Boiler and Turbine Institution---have filed bankruptcy petitions in
court against UVZ in the last few months due to unpaid debts.

[So **Putin will strut like a peacock**]{.underline}

[In response to]{.underline} these **[growing domestic
pressures]{.underline}**, President [Putin]{.underline} has [spent 2016
trying to further **consolidate** his **power**]{.underline}. He created
the Council for Strategic Development and Priority Projects. This
council aims to change things in the economy and the social sphere and
to increase economic growth rates.

In an effort to show strength, [Putin]{.underline} also
[revamped]{.underline} some of the branches of **[security
bodies]{.underline}**. [Russia will continue to **legitimize the
regime** in Moscow to those who suffer economically. They will do this
by **showing Russian power worldwide** without really doing
anything]{.underline}.

[The **worse** the **Russian economy gets**, the **bigger** these
**shows of power will have to be**]{.underline}. [Moscow will engage in
**strategic regions of the world**]{.underline} in 2017 [with
**war**like **talk** and]{.underline} potential **[military

#### While previously low prices have stopped Russian aggression, that's no longer true -- our evidence is comparative

**Nelle-Davis 16** (April13th, 2016, Ashley Nelle-Davis is an Operations
Associate at Data Transparency Coalition "Low Oil Prices Won't Deter
Russian Aggression, American Leadership Will,"
https://www.americanactionforum.org/print/?url=https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/low-oil-prices-wont-deter-russian-aggression-american-leadership-will/)

SUMMARY Russia's aggressive behavior has put it at odds with the United
States and the West. [Low oil prices are **unlikely to force a
significant reversal of Russia's sustained increase in military spending
or restrain the country's aggressive behavior**]{.underline}. The United
States should take proactive measures to deter future disruptive actions
from Russia by reassuring European allies, committing to Ukrainian
stability, and restoring U.S. leadership in the world. INTRODUCTION
Russia's recent aggression has put it at odds with the United States and
the international community. On a quest to return to the global stage,
Russia has violated state sovereignty, undermined regional security,
subverted European unity, and reinforced an authoritarian regime in
Syria---all while repressing civil liberties at home. This behavior has
garnered only mediocre responses from the United States and the West.
[With oil prices at historic lows]{.underline} and the partial
withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria, [it is tempting to believe that
the decline in the Russian economy will restrain the country's
disruptive behavior. The United States, however, **should not rely on
the depressed oil market as a substitute for action to deter
Russia.**]{.underline} ECONOMIC ANALYSIS **[Nearly half of Russia's
budget revenues come from oil and gas taxes]{.underline}**, suggesting
that [Russian economic health is directly related to the strength of the
oil market.]{.underline} Recent AAF research shows that the Russian
economy is in poor shape, [but low oil prices have not severely affected
the country's ability to finance government expenditures.]{.underline}
The main reason behind this is that oil is traded in U.S. dollars, which
has worked to Russia's advantage. As an oil exporting country, Russia
has benefited from the relative strength of the dollar, cushioning the
fall of the ruble in the midst of low oil prices. While oil prices in
U.S. dollars fell 70 percent over the past three years, the price in
Russian rubles only fell by 20 to 30 percent. Additionally, Russia's
foreign currency reserves have appreciated with the strength of the
dollar. This fortifies Moscow's ability to fund expenditures, since the
country is able to finance even more of its budget, which is set in
rubles, by drawing from their reserves and converting the currency.
RUSSIA IN CONTEXT [To be sure, the Russian economy has suffered due to
historically low oil prices]{.underline}. In response to the 3.7 percent
contraction in the economy, [Russia adjusted some of the
country's]{.underline} budget, even sacrificing some defense spending.
Late last year, Russia announced that it would cut its 2016 defense
budget by 5 percent. While a surprising move, given the country's
ongoing military modernization project, the 5 percent cut must be read
in context. First, this decrease in spending is less than the
anticipated 10 percent across the board cuts for the rest of the budget.
Second, Russia's defense budget has increased significantly in the past
15 years, as seen in Chart 1, and military modernization remains a
policy priority for the Russian state and its economy. Similarly, it
would be easy to misread Russia's partial withdrawal from Syria. Many
have speculated that a weak economy at home may have motivated Russian
President Vladimir Putin's decision to pull back troops. Reports of
ongoing military shipments to Syria indicate that Putin is not
completely disengaging from the conflict. While any withdrawal will save
Russia some money, it is too simplistic to assert that economic
pressures alone, or even primarily, motivated Russia's decision. Moscow
is in a greater position of power now than it was before Putin led his
country into Syria and reemerged as a power broker. The initial
withdrawal from Syria demonstrates that Putin is close to achieving his
stated goal to stabilize Assad's regime. At the same time, Putin is also
achieving his goals in Ukraine by annexing Crimea, weakening the
national government, and perpetuating the conflict in the country's
east. For all of the international criticism, Putin's foreign aggression
has only boosted his popularity at home and emboldened his commitment to
remain in a position of power. [Expecting the global oil market to force
a reduction in defense expenditures would be an **unreliable and
irresponsible way** to deter Russian aggression]{.underline}. The
Russian economy relies on oil prices for long-term stability, but in the
short-term, foreign currency reserves and a strong U.S. dollar are
saving its economy from a real crisis. The United States must take
significant steps to counter Russian aggression, reassure European
allies, and restore U.S. leadership in the world.

#### Decline in [oil revenue]{.underline} makes Russia [more dangerous]{.underline}, but they [won't decrease defense spending]{.underline} because of lack of revenue, they'll just [deny they're using them]{.underline}

**Elwes 15** \[Jay Elwes, Prospect. Former MI6 head: **[Putin could get
more dangerous]{.underline}**. March 20, 2015.

In contrast, Dearlove said that the declining oil price poses a
substantial threat to Russia. Having peaked at just under \$150 per
barrel, oil now stands at just over \$40. [The **Russian economy** is
**heavily reliant** on **oil revenues**]{.underline}---[almost **half**
of Russian government **revenue** is from natural
resources]{.underline}. The **[fall in price]{.underline}** has
[strained the Russian government's ability to spend]{.underline}, has
[caused the rouble to decline sharply and large amounts of **capital**
has been **taken out of the country**]{.underline}. [This could lead to
**worrying side-effects**]{.underline}.

"If the oil price drops further, the [consequences for the Russian
economy are going got be parlous]{.underline}. [That could **make Russia
behave** **more dangerously**]{.underline}. It could behave worse," said
Dearlove, before adding: "I don't think that we are necessarily in a
very good position at the moment."

Dearlove told Prospect that he was unconvinced by the outcome of the
peace deal brokered between Putin and the Ukrainian government by Angela
Merkel, the German Chancellor and Francois Hollande, the French
President. "The only thing \[the negotiations\] seemed to have delivered
was the ceasefire," said Dearlove, "but it delivered a ceasefire when
Russia had obtained what they wanted."

"[The **Russian technique** in **handling these** sorts of **issues** is
to put **massive** quasi-clandestine **resources** **into the equation**
and then **deny** that **they are using them**]{.underline}," said
Dearlove "\[and\] to make sure that the pegs in the ground that they
have as objectives are driven in and held. And at the moment we seem to
be powerless to shift Russia away from a de facto situation, which they
have largely created.

### 1AR Russia Turn -- AT: Demographics Thumper 

#### Regardless the Russian government will just increase migration and retirement ages -- empirics prove

**Nishiuchi 11** (Toru Nishiuchi and Yulia Mironova (ECSPE Consultants)
under the guidance of Sudharshan Canagarajah (ECSPE Lead Economist).
"Growth and Labor Sufficiency in Russia: Will Russia Face Labor Force
Shortage in the Next 20 Years?".
<http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTECA/Resources/RussiaGrowthAccountingLaborJuly122011).pdf>)

[Russian government fully **recognizes importance of demographic
problems**]{.underline} [and implements combination of **policies aimed
at improving demographic situation**]{.underline}, including complex
measures to improve health (longer life expectancy, higher birth rates,
lower level of diseases, etc.) and education outcomes under the national
programs "Health" and "Education" and to provide better living
conditions under the national program "Affordable and Comfortable
Housing". However these measures will not likely yield quick results,
i.e. improve demographic satiation, in the next 10-20 years.z [Russian
policy makers have various instruments available to address the decline
in the population of working age in **short- and
medium-term**.]{.underline} Increasing labor participation rates,
[postponing retirement ages, stimulating the labor market participation
of women and migration policies are **among those instruments.**
Increased immigration has the advantage of having an **immediate
effect**]{.underline} on the age and composition of the population
because of the younger age structure of net migration. In addition,
fertility rates of immigrant women are often relatively high, which can
boost fertility and hence long-term population growth. The role of
migration policies, however, in addressing demographic challenges can
only be complementary to other policies and is subject to a number of
practical and political constraints. [Russia has been already receiving
**large inflows of labor migrants** which partially offset decline in
total population]{.underline} (see paragraph 1 in section 2). But these
massive migrant inflows featured mostly un-skilled labor which was
attracted by large wage differentials fueled by country's oil wealth.
With envisaged decline of oil and gas sectors output, the needs in this
type of labor will subside. Now the Government may consider setting up
new requirements for recruitment of foreign labor (e.g. education,
skills, age groups, etc.) to be able to attract labor of higher quality
to specific sectors or regions. This will not only help to close the
labor market gap, but contribute to overall labor productivity and
country competitiveness improvement. This will, however, require
substantial preparatory work, including labor needs assessment at
sectoral and regional level. We show that [domestic supply of labor in
Russian Federation under current demographic trends]{.underline} and
maintaining current level of investments **[could be sufficient to
ensure sustainable long-term non-oil-gas growth rate of above 3.0
percent]{.underline}** only if the country is able to sustain strong
productivity growth rates of about 3-4 percent per year in a long-term.

#### Immigration flows are high, especially in the face of xenophobia in Europe and the US

**Ragozin 17** (March 14^th^, 2017, Leonid Ragozin is a freelance
contributor at Bloomberg, "Russia Wants Immigrants the World Doesn't,"
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-14/russia-s-alternative-universe-immigrants-welcome>)

Work sites filled with immigrant laborers aren't particularly novel in
developed countries, and [Russia]{.underline} is no exception.
[According to the UN]{.underline}, the nation [has 11 million
foreigners]{.underline}, many without visas and from largely Muslim,
Central Asian countries. But [as Europe's refugee crisis continues to
fuel a global resurgence of isolationism and xenophobia, **in
Russia---the world's third-biggest destination for international
immigrants---things are being handled a little
differently.**]{.underline} A recent editorial in Nezavisimaya Gazeta
was titled "Trump and Le Pen would be opposition in Russia." Under
President Vladimir Putin, the newspaper argues, being anti-immigration
is the same as being anti-establishment. "Domestic TV blasts Europe for
multiculturalism, for receiving refugees from Mideast and Africa, for
tolerance to migrants," its editors wrote. But [in Russia,
anti-immigrant stances are sometimes "characterized by the authorities
as an unacceptable form of nationalism." The reality in Russia is that
the immigrant economy is **very much part of its recovery from a
prolonged recession. And the government knows it.**]{.underline} "Russia
is experiencing a huge deficit of workforce," explains Andrey Movchan,
director of the economic policy program at the Moscow Carnegie Center.
"We badly need cheap labor that cannot be found inside the country."
[Immigrants]{.underline} clean city streets and maintain huge
residential buildings that dot the skyline. They [play a key role in
manufacturing, retail, and service sectors.]{.underline} In the
restaurant industry, kitchen staff from countries like Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, and Georgia stay for years, sending most of their money
home. "If you take out the [migrants]{.underline}, who **[comprise 15
percent of the Russian workforce]{.underline}**, it will be impossible
to replace them," Movchan says, warning that the higher wages needed to
attract Russian workers to such jobs would raise prices and hurt the
recovery.

### 1AR Russia Turn -- Russia Econ Decline -\> War 

#### Russian economic diversions spark great power war 

**Fisher 14** (December 17^th^, 2014, Max Fisher writes for the New York
Times and Vox, "The worse Russia\'s economy gets, the more dangerous
Putin becomes,"
<https://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7401681/russia-putin-ruble>).

[**The worse Russia\'s economy gets, the more Putin will need to
escalate hostility abroad** As the economy sinks, Putin will only become
more reliant on these sorts of shenanigans he\'s used previously to stay
in power]{.underline}. [He\'s]{.underline} not just worried
[about]{.underline} his popularity, after all, but [his very legitimacy
as the head of state]{.underline}; the 2012 election showed him that
Russians could turn against him. [Putin has little choice, then, but to
seek legitimacy by stirring up more crises abroad, **positioning himself
as a nationalist hero leading the brave Russian state in a hostile
world.**]{.underline} But the only way he can maintain that image at
home is if his soft conflict with the West continues. Putin can\'t
deescalate tensions in Ukraine and more broadly in Europe because those
tensions are just about all he has left. More broadly[, the obvious move
here is for Putin is to blame his country\'s falling economy on American
and European imperialism.]{.underline} By playing up the role of outside
hostility in Russia\'s economic crisis, [Putin would shift the blame
and, just as important, promote the idea that Russians have to come
together and **endure the downturn as a matter of national mission
against a foreign enemy.**]{.underline} This is part of why Putin has
spent much of 2014 comparing the pro-Western Ukrainian government to
Nazis and talking about World War Two. The memory of Nazi Germany\'s
1941 invasion is still palpable in Russia. By hitting on the memory of
those years of hardship and struggle, and raising subtle and
not-so-subtle comparisons to the international tensions today, Putin is
trying to persuade Russians that, the worse things get, the more that
they should support him and his government. [That\'s working, but **the
worse Russia\'s economy gets, the more that Putin will have to
exacerbate tensions with the West in order to justify blaming it all on
foreign conflict and enemies.**]{.underline}

said. "[But pretty soon people are going to start asking questions." If

military industrial complex ---]{.underline} first, [to shore up popular
support by maintaining an artificially high level of employment

the Putin regime both politically and economically," Dr Petrov said.

#### That causes [state collapse]{.underline} and [wildfire prolif]{.underline}

**Rosen 15** \[writer @ Business Insider, Stratfor predicts loose nukes
in Russia will be \'the greatest crisis of the next decade\',

[The most alarming prediction]{.underline} in the Decade Forecast
[from]{.underline} private intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting, or
[Stratfor, involves a **Russian collapse** leading to]{.underline} a
**[nuclear crisis]{.underline}**. The firm believes [the Russian
Federation will not survive the decade]{.underline} in its present form,
[after]{.underline} a combination of international [sanctions, plunging
oil prices, and a suffering ruble trigger]{.underline} a [political and
social crisis. Russia will then **devolve into an archipelago** of
often-impoverished and confrontational local governments under the
Kremlin\'s very loose control. \"We expect Moscow\'s authority to weaken
substantially, leading to]{.underline} the [formal and informal
fragmentation]{.underline} of Russia\" the report states, adding, \"It
is unlikely that the Russian Federation will survive in its current
form.\" If that [upheaval]{.underline} happened, it [could lead
to]{.underline} what Stratfor calls \"[the **greatest crisis of the next
decade**\": Moscow\'s loss of control over the **world\'s biggest
nuclear weapons stockpile**.]{.underline} Russia is the world\'s largest
country and its 8,000 weapons are fairly spread out over its 6.6 million
square miles. According to a Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists study,
Russia has 40 nuclear sites, which is twice as many as the US uses to
house a comparable number of warheads. This policy of
[dispersal]{.underline} makes it difficult for an enemy to disable the
Russian nuclear arsenal in a single attack, but it also [makes the
Russian stockpile difficult to control.]{.underline} The Bulletin report
also found that the Russia was uncertain exactly how many short-range
\"tactical\" or city-busting \"strategic\" nukes it has, nor what the
weapons\' state of assembly or alert status may be. Stratfor fears that
the [dissolution of the Russian Federation could cause an unprecedented
nuclear security crisis. Not only could]{.underline} the
**[c]{.underline}**ommand-**[and]{.underline}**-**[c]{.underline}**ontrol
mechanisms [for Russia\'s massive and highly opaque nuclear arsenal
**completely break down**]{.underline}. [Moscow might lose its physical
control over weapons and launch platforms as well.]{.underline}
\"[Russia is the site of a massive nuclear strike force distributed
throughout the hinterlands]{.underline},\" the Decade Forecast explains.
\"The [decline of Moscow\'s power will open the question of who controls
those missiles and how their non-use can be guaranteed.\"]{.underline}

#### Russian economic decline risks extinction

**Filger 09** (Sheldon Filger, author and blogger for the Huffington
Post, "Russian Economy Faces Disastrous Free Fall Contraction",
<http://www.globaleconomiccrisis.com/blog/archives/356>)

[**In Russia**,]{.underline} historically, **[economic]{.underline}**
health **[and]{.underline}** political [**stability are**
intertwined]{.underline} to a degree that is rarely encountered in other
major industrialized economies. It was the economic stagnation of the
former Soviet Union that led to its political downfall. Similarly,
Medvedev and Putin, both intimately acquainted with their nation\'s
history, are unquestionably alarmed at the prospect that Russia\'s
**[economic crisis will endanger the nation\'s political
stability]{.underline}**, achieved at great cost after years of chaos
following the demise of the Soviet Union. Already, strikes and protests
are occurring among rank and file workers facing unemployment or
non-payment of their salaries. Recent polling demonstrates that the once
supreme popularity ratings of Putin and Medvedev are eroding rapidly.
Beyond the political elites are the financial oligarchs, who have been
forced to deleverage, even unloading their yachts and executive jets in
a desperate attempt to raise cash. [**Should the Russian economy**
deteriorate]{.underline} to the point where economic collapse is not out
of the question, the impact will go far beyond the obvious accelerant
such [an outcome would be]{.underline} for the [Global Economic
Crisis.]{.underline} There is a geopolitical dimension that is even more
relevant then the economic context. Despite its economic vulnerabilities
and perceived decline from superpower status, **[Russia remains one
of]{.underline}** only **[two nations]{.underline}** on earth **[with a
nuclear arsenal of sufficient]{.underline}** scope and **[capability to
destroy the world]{.underline}** as we know it. For that reason, it is
not only President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin who will be lying
awake at nights over the prospect that **[a national economic
crisis]{.underline}** can **[transform itself into]{.underline}** a
virulent and [**destabilizing** social and political
upheaval.]{.underline} It just may be possible that U.S. President
Barack Obama\'s national security team has already briefed him about the
consequences of a major economic meltdown in Russia for the peace of the
world. After all, the most recent national intelligence estimates put
out by the U.S. intelligence community have already concluded that the
Global Economic Crisis represents the greatest national security threat
to the United States, due to its facilitating political instability in
the world. During the years Boris Yeltsin ruled Russia, security forces
responsible for guarding the nation\'s nuclear arsenal went without pay
for months at a time, leading to fears that **[desperate personnel
would]{.underline}** illicitly [sell nuclear weapons to terrorist
organizations. **If the**]{.underline} current **[economic crisis in
Russia were to deteriorate]{.underline}** much further, **[how secure
would the Russian]{.underline}** nuclear **[arsenal
remain?]{.underline}** It may be that **[the financial impact of the
Global Economic Crisis is its least dangerous
consequence.]{.underline}**

### 1AR Russia Turn -- Russia War -\> Extinction 

#### Causes extinction 

**Majumdar 18** (Dave Majumdar, Defense Editor for the National
Interest, Doomsday: Why a War with Russia Would Go Nuclear (And Kill
Billions of People), January 25, 2018,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/doomsday-why-war-russia-would-go-nuclear-kill-billions-24214)

Doomsday: Why **[a War with Russia Would Go Nuclear (And Kill
Billions]{.underline}** of People) While [a recent RAND]{.underline}
Corporation [study concluded that **Russia could overrun NATO's member
states**]{.underline} Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania **[in the Baltics
within sixty hours]{.underline}**, the war games did not simulate the
use of nuclear weapons. [If]{.underline}, however, [a war were to
breakout between NATO and Russia]{.underline}, **[nuclear weapons would
certainly come into play]{.underline}**---[**especially** if the
conflict were **going poorly for Moscow**]{.underline}. **[Unlike the
Soviet Union, which had a]{.underline}** stated "**[no first use"
policy, modern Russia explicitly rejected that pledge]{.underline}** in
1993. [In fact, as Moscow's conventional forces continued to
atrophy]{.underline} during the economic and social meltdown of the
1990s, [Russia developed a doctrine called
**de-escalation**]{.underline} in 2000 . Simply put, [if Russia were
faced with a large-scale attack that could defeat its conventional
forces, Moscow might **resort to nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. In
2010, Russia revised the doctrine somewhat as its conventional forces
started to recover from the aftermath of the Soviet collapse---the
current version states Moscow would use nuclear weapons in situations
"that would put in danger the very existence of the state."
[While]{.underline} the RAND study shows that [Russia would]{.underline}
be able to [take the Baltics]{.underline} fairly [easily, the war game
didn't explore what would happen in the event of a **NATO counter
offensive**]{.underline}. The RAND study simply states: [Such a rapid
defeat would leave NATO]{.underline} [with]{.underline} a
[limited]{.underline} number of [options, all bad: a **bloody
counteroffensive**]{.underline}, **[fraught with escalatory
risk]{.underline}**, [to liberate the Baltics]{.underline}; [to
**escalate itself**, as it threatened to do]{.underline} to avert defeat
during the Cold War; [or]{.underline} to **[concede]{.underline}** at
least temporary **[defeat]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} uncertain
but predictably **[disastrous consequences]{.underline}** [for the
Alliance]{.underline} and, not incidentally, the people of the Baltics.
[A NATO counter-offensive would be]{.underline} bloody and fraught with
escalatory risk---but it's one of the **[probable]{.underline}**
outcomes of a Russian invasion. [In that eventuality, Russian
conventional forces---of which only a portion are well trained
and]{.underline} well [equipped---would likely be]{.underline} severely
damaged or even **[destroyed]{.underline}**. Moreover, if NATO forces
hit targets inside Russia or crossed over into Russian territory, Moscow
might conclude that there is a danger to the existence of the state.
After all, Moscow has expressed concerns in the past that regime change
by the West is an all too real danger. [In that situation, Russia might
**counter**]{.underline} advancing NATO forces [with]{.underline} its
arsenal of **[tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. The Russian
tactical nuclear arsenal is not nearly as large as the Soviet arsenal
had once been, but concrete numbers are hard to come by. The Soviet
Union was thought to have possessed between 15,000 and 25,000 tactical
nuclear weapons of all types ranging from suitcase-sized containers and
nuclear mines to short-range aircraft delivered missiles, nuclear
gravity bombs and artillery shells---as well as short-, medium- and
intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads. While Moscow has been
slowly eliminating its non-strategic arsenal since the end of the Cold
War, Russia many still have as many as 4,000 tactical nuclear weapons ,
according to the Congressional Research Service. However, other analyses
suggest that Russia has as few as 2,000 operational tactical nuclear
weapons. [A]{.underline} more **[recent analysis]{.underline}** by Royal
United Service Institute's Igor Sutyagin [suggests that Russia
has]{.underline} a maximum of **[1,040 non-strategic nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. Of those about 128-210 warheads are assigned to
the Russian ground forces. The Russian navy has about 330 tactical
nuclear weapons, while the Russian air force has 334 non-strategic
weapons. Meanwhile, Russian air defense forces have a further
sixty-eight to 166 tactical nuclear weapons mounted on various
surface-to-air missiles.
