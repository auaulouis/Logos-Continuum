#### US foreign military sales and direct commercial sales of arms are premised on relational ties -- these bonds serve US self interests both economically and geopolitically, and contribute to a geospatial imaginary premised on territorial egoism.

**[Ideas of new beginnings, agendas and [spatial horizons have long been
a feature of]{.mark} the [geopolitical
imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agnew and Corbridge, 1995). Since
the early-1990s, one such imaginary (re-) scripted by Western political
elites is that they have moved away from the state-centric agenda of the
Cold War era, dominated by purely self-interested concerns for domestic
economy, security and power. **[[According to the rhetoric, a more
ethically-grounded foreign policy has taken]{.mark} its [place,
underpinned by universal moral principles]{.mark} and a commitment to
promote the protection of rights and freedoms of extra-territorial
citizens.]{.underline}** **[Critical geographers have been quick to
criticize [these]{.mark} and similar [socio-spatial imaginaries]{.mark}.
Amongst others, they have argued that such scripts [have]{.mark} often
[performed covert, instrumental roles.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[That
is, [rather than marking a more progressive]{.mark} moral [turn]{.mark}
in foreign policy action, [they are]{.mark} part-and-parcel of [a
discursive strategy]{.mark} which seeks [to legitimize existing security
agendas, economic interests and]{.mark} patterns of [domination over
space]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Flint and Falah, 2004; O'Loughlin and
Kolossov, 2002; ÓTuathail, 2000; Power, 2003; Roberts et al., 2003;
Sparke, 2007). In the present paper, we set-out to scrutinize the
alleged gap between political imaginaries and material outcomes, using
the example of Western arms exports to developing countries. **[Our
basic thesis is that [states' official commitment to a value-based arms
controls policy is]{.mark} largely a matter of [symbolic]{.mark}
politics [-- with countries reluctant to sacrifice national interests of
economy and security]{.mark} in name of []{.mark}protecting or advancing
the rights and freedoms of extra-territorial citizens.]{.underline}**
Using quantitative data on large weapons transfers from France, Germany,
the UK and the US over the period 1992--2004, we find evidence to
support our arguments. **[According to our statistical estimations,
[neither human rights abuses nor autocratic polity]{.mark} would appear
to [reduce the likelihood of countries receiving Western arms,]{.mark}
or reduce the relative share of a particular exporter's weapons they
receive. In fact, [human rights abusing countries are]{.mark} actually
[more likely to receive weapons from the US,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
while autocratic regimes emerge as more likely recipients of weaponry
from France and the UK. Reinforcing the impression that
extra-territorial ethical considerations are far from para- mount, **[we
show that [the geography of Western arms exports is]{.mark} closely
[aligned with self-interested, economically and geopolitically-important
relational ties.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Hence developing countries
which are more important trading partners exhibit a greater probability
of qualifying for arms, as generally do countries which fulfill the
domestic interests of the supplying state extra-territorially as
military allies. [Western countries have not]{.mark}, it seems,
systematically [acted counter to]{.mark} more [conventional, materialist
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our statistical estimations say
nothing about underlying causal- ity, but it would be difficult to
square the above findings with behavioural explanations based solely on
hegemony. If power were indeed the decisive variable, then the US should
logically be ex- pected to have shown a greater propensity to defy
international normative roles than the three European states, both in
the case of human rights and democracy. **[For sure, [the US hardly acts
in the spirit of its self-declared ethical
principles]{.mark},]{.underline}** but nor does France or the UK. Both
sets of countries have systematically contravened one principle or
another. Germany fares only slightly better with respect to democracy,
but not human rights protection. What seems to matter more, at least in
defining what states can or cannot get away with, are domestic
institutions (Donnelly and Liang-Fenton, 2004). That the US is more
willing to overtly ignore human rights abuses than autocratic government
is broadly consis- tent with the idea that the country is, first and
foremost, founded on democratic ideals rather than humanitarian ones
(Moss, 1995). Although far from irrelevant, the domestic appropriateness
of defending or promoting democracy in non-domestic spaces would appear
to be less deeply institutionalized in Britain and France than in the
US. **[Instead, [partly as a consequence of their historic role in
colonialism, norms of extra-territorial responsibility are]{.mark}
centrally [defined around human rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}**13 The
idea that domes- tic institutions matter is also supported by the German
case -- the country with the ''least bad" record regarding arms
transfers. Ger- many's foreign policy identity, which was formed in the
shadow of an excessively autocratic, militaristic and human rights
violating past, is one where economic or geostrategic concerns are least
likely to trump the promotion of Western values (Erb, 2003). What are
the implications of our findings? **[Most obviously, by
[exposing]{.mark} the [hypocrisy underlying]{.mark} geopolitical
imaginaries of [ethical foreign policy]{.mark}, they [remind us of the
importance of interrogating]{.mark} the [discursive constructions of
political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Flint and Falah, 2004;
ÓTuathail, 1992; Roberts et al., 2003). **[[While]{.mark} a [more
ethically-grounded foreign policy may script a geopolitics of
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sparke, 2007), **[[underpinned by]{.mark} a
deterritorialised [concern for the well-being of]{.mark} a more
spatially inclusive, [cosmopolitan humanity, our findings suggest
that]{.mark} such [socio-spatial narratives]{.mark} (potentially)
[conceal a geopolitics of territorial egoism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In
an important sense, therefore, our study speaks to wider debates about
the changing boundaries of the modern state. Although it has become
popular to talk about a blurring of domestic and foreign, and the
emergence of a post-sovereign state identity, the findings of the
present study suggest that it is important not to take this argument too
far. Aspirationally and rhetorically, Western countries may subscribe to
a non-territorial conception of rights and duties, and envision a state
whose interests lie in promoting universal values across borders. Yet if
the case of arms control is anything to go by, these universals have not
generally dislodged the primacy of national economic and geopolitical
interests. Far from the borderless world envisaged by hyperglobalists,
territorial borders would appear to continue to enframe economic and
geostrategic interests, and centrally guide Western states' foreign
policy actions (Yeung, 1998).

#### Normative political calls for arms control frequently take for granted the who, why, and how of arms control, securitizing space through an us/them dichotomy that frames the United States as a domestic homeland vulnerable to foreign threats. It is critical that we investigate the representational economy of arms control discourses, as taken for granted presuppositions about the foreign and domestic follow patterns of geopolitical thought that evacuate the global South from both policy and scholarly analysis and form the moral basis of political campaigns for and against arms control.

**[[Who controls which arms and why is essential to the]{.mark} future
[geopolitical order]{.mark} of the planet in so far as the threat of the
use of military force is part of the political calculus in coming
decades.]{.underline}** **[[The question of who controls arms is related
to where]{.mark} that ['who' resides.]{.mark} [The world, and how it
might be changed, does not look the same from Washington as]{.mark} it
does in [Tehran]{.mark}, nor [Cairo]{.mark}, [Moscow or Delhi]{.mark},
and [the]{.mark} common [assumption]{.mark}s [that]{.mark} the [American
dominance]{.mark} in geopolitical matters [is]{.mark} necessarily
[permanent isn't one that can be taken for granted]{.mark} in any
discussion of geopolitics for the 21st century.]{.underline}** A world
of sovereign equals, or one with a multiplicity of great powers would
apparently have a rather different set of arms control priorities than
one dominated by one superpower. The assumptions about a desirable world
order in the 21st century are not universally shared, but they matter
greatly as the premises of political conduct and the rationale for
foreign policy making in particular. The logic of American preeminence
was the key theme in the Bush Doctrine that dominated the first decade
of the century.1 There was a very distinctive notion of controlling arms
in its strategies of preeminence. Crucial in its innovations in American
thinking were the unavoidable necessities of dealing with globalization
and the clear recognition that the geopolitics of the 20th century had
been bypassed by new developments. And yet, despite the explicit
formulation of the geopolitical context as a matter of global war, some
very old-fashioned state rivalries persisted, not least the apparent
attempt to gain some form of nuclear strategic superiority over Russia,
and an explicit containment attempt on Iran ostensibly designed to stop
the regime gaining nuclear weapons. Arms control in that context was
about controlling arms that might challenge American hegemony. From the
beginning of the Obama administration in Washington in 2009 there was a
more obvious inclination to weapons reduction, and non-proliferation and
arms reduction themes reemerged in serious diplomatic discussion. An
ambitious agenda of comprehensive nuclear weapons test ban treaty
ratification in the Senate, a new strategic arms reduction treaty with
Russia, and the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons by strengthening the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty were all spelled out in a speech in
April 2009 in Prague.2 But less clear is how these policies will deal
with the apparently recalcitrant peripheral states in the world system
much less the 'nuclear outlaws' of India, Pakistan and Israel who more
or less operate outside the international regimes on these matters.
**[How all this fits into a reshaped geopolitical order in the longer
term is key to the question of what kind of arms control policies are
sought by whom and where.]{.underline}** Nor is it clear that the locus
of arms control initiatives is necessarily driven only by state
priorities. The most interesting point about President Obama's speech in
Prague is in the part that invoked his own political themes of change,
and change driven by popular demand. Invoking the experiences of both
the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Obama
suggested that popular demand for nuclear disarmament was crucial, that
the refusal to accept nuclear armed rivalries were key to the future of
geopolitics; [**[resistance is not useless]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It
is, he once again argued, essential to political change. **[But [change
to what kind of a world]{.mark} for the 21st century [is the question
that hangs over discussions of the technical practices of arms
control]{.mark} and the finer points of diplomatic
agreements[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[The other point that is [implicit
in calls for arms control]{.mark}, in President Obama's speeches, and in
very many other places, [is the]{.mark} crucial [specification of the
world as a dangerous place,]{.mark} and hence in need of arms
control[.]{.mark} But [precisely who is threatening to whom
where]{.mark} is frequently less clearly specified not least because it
[is]{.mark} frequently [taken for granted in political rhetoric.]{.mark}
But as the rest of this paper suggests, [focussing]{.mark} on those
taken for granted contextualizations, [on the implicit]{.mark}, and
sometimes explicit, [geographical framing of the world]{.mark} as
needing certain forms of arms control, [is a useful analytical way of
clarifying how the politics of arms control
works.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Many of the new innovations in Washington
retain the geopolitical assumptions of American hegemony. In Andrew
Bacevich's terms they follow the longheld foreign policy credo in which
American thinking has 'an abiding conviction that the minimum essentials
of international peace and order require the United States to maintain a
global military presence, to configure its forces for global power
projection, and to counter existing or anticipated threats by relying on
a policy of global interventionism'.3 Nonetheless, and this is the key
point in the rest of this paper, the geography of violence, and the
technological means of its application have changed very substantially
since the Cold War.4 **[Thinking through how these new circumstances,
only loosely caught in the terms 'globalization' on the one hand and
'human security' on the other, are tied into campaigns both by civil
society and states to control arms matters both as a matter of policy
and a matter of scholarly analysis of the new geopolitical circumstances
of the 21st century.]{.underline}** What is clear is that a combination
of the inter-related phenomena of urbanization, climate change,
migration, financial crises, technological innovation and the rapidly
shifting geography of global production is changing how geopolitics
works. The rise of multilateral institutions emphasizes how inadequate
nationalist political visions are in these circumstances, however
tempting they are for politicians mustering domestic support for various
policies. CR IT ICAL GEO POL IT IC S AND THE CONTROL O F ARM S 41

contextualization [is one way into this discussion.]{.mark} [These
are]{.mark} in part [dependent on what are taken to be desirable future
arrangements of global power;]{.mark} after all arms control is
frequently rationalized in terms of its preventing conflict and
facilitating the emergence of a world no longer endangered by large
scale violence in a situation where the technological capabilities of
industrial warfare threaten destruction on a planetary
scale.]{.underline}** Peter Kropotkin's 19th century call for a
geography that dissipates prejudices and promotes peaceful cooperation
is now powerfully reinforced by the growing recognition in many places
that our fates are now much more obviously interconnected in a
globalized world. Arms control during the Cold War was to a very
substantial extent about controlling arms that might destabilize matters
in a crisis situation. Preventing situations where peripheral violence
might escalate to a superpower nuclear war was key to the efforts; so
too were the use of technological modes of verification. This was not
the whole story, but it was a dominant theme. **[After the Cold War this
mode of thinking is much less obviously the necessary framework for arms
control. Now the questions relate to larger questions of world order and
the locus of authority in a rapidly changing situation. But [old
patterns of geopolitical thinking]{.mark} remain, and in Washington in
particular [reproduce]{.mark} the foreign policy credo in the
technological assumptions about verification and [the presuppositions
that American military supremacy is a necessity in a world order
understood in terms of modernity managing the planet.]{.mark} In part
[they do this by perpetuating the]{.mark} powerful geopolitical logics
that specify matters in the [cultural terms of them and us,]{.mark}

critical geopolitics analyses such discourses of danger, the
geographical representations of insecurity and the articulation of
popular identities mobilized in security politics.6 **[[How the world is

policy making, but in doing so dramatically simplify the complex
interconnected geographies of a globalized human world. A key point of
the critical geopolitics literature is to suggest that the geographical
imaginations that structure politics can be different, but it is never a
foregone conclusion that some geographical designations are better than
others; nor that the complexity of global politics is well served by
particular invocations.9 **[[This is the case in international attempts

or]{.mark} the [appropriate categories for scholarly
analysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But the question is implied in
President Obama's Prague speech. States as well as social movements and
political protest organizations are involved in arms control, and there
are many uneasy alliances on these matters, alliances where states
seeking unilateral advantage by the control of arms cooperate uneasily
with social movement campaigners who frequently advocate the total
abolition of whole classes of weapons. Where arms are campaigned against
and why is the obvious first question that arises. Who organizes
protests, and who runs which political organizations is a related
question.11 Which weapons are owned and used by whom where and for what
ostensible reason matters too. Likewise, clearly in the case of land
mines and the recent agreement on cluster bombs, the questions of
victims, and the obvious point that weapons that violate the 'laws of
war' in particular by not discriminating between combatants and
civilians, are especially worthy of condemnation and hence being
controlled. Which states sign on, and which ones don't, and where
matters greatly. Critical geopolitics is about these contextualisations
of security, danger, fear and violence, and as such it should have much
to say because the details of arms control negotiations are so
frequently fraught with the overlapping problems that individual states
see in terms of complex threat perceptions in particular regions, only
most obviously in the case of the Middle East.12 **[This is not only a
matter of challenging the obviously self serving strategies of
attempting to accomplish unilateral disarmament by coercion as in the
cases of Iran and North Korea, but also a matter of the larger
discourses that assume the inevitability of eternal rivalry between
territorial states, part of why arms control appears to be a necessity
in the first place.]{.underline}** **[In quizzing the taken for granted
specifications of violence and its purported
geographies,]{.underline}**13 **[to tackle the implicit geopolitics that
structures the discussion of arms control, and in particular the fears
of proliferation that have preoccupied Washington so intensely in the

[suggest some lines of criticism that unsettle the dominant terms of the
arms control discussion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But, with the notable
exception of Spiegel and Le Billon's recent paper, little has been done
explicitly on arms control.14 The rest of this paper is thus a
preliminary exploration that suggests that explicitly thinking about the
contextual dimensions of arms control adds a critical edge to any
analysis of likely trends by bluntly asking the geographical questions
of precisely whom these policies benefit where. Looking to the
geopolitical contextualizations implicit, and sometimes explicit, in the
contemporary discussions of such things as strategic arms limitation,
the current angst over Tehran and nuclear technology, the question of
nuclear weapons free zones, the South Asia situation, and such things as
the international humanitarian campaigns against land mines and, more
recently, cluster munitions, emphasizes the importance of those
contextualizations in arms control discussions. CR IT ICAL GEO POL IT IC
S AND THE CONTROL O F ARM S 43 Downloaded By: \[Dalby, Simon\] At: 14:51
26 May 2011 Arms Control Clearly arms control is a political process,
and a technical one too. After all it should never be forgotten that
states are very keen to control weapons they don't own or use but which
might be used against them, and not so keen on agreeing to binding
agreements to limit weapons that they obviously gain some perceived
advantage from deploying. Activists campaign for nuclear free zones, and
such things as international bans on the production and deployment of
land mines and cluster bombs, not least because they violate
humanitarian norms and the differentiation between combatants and
civilians. States seek the control of chemical and bacteriological
weapons among other things, but have a decidedly selective attention
span to weapons abolition. Nowhere more so than in the case of nuclear
weapons where comprehensive disarmament is the avowed goal of many
states but not a practical matter for most of those who have the
weapons.15 Geopolitical context explains much but not all of these
matters; threat perceptions and national pride matter too it seems and
as Ken Booth warned long ago, ethnocentrism continues to haunt strategic
matters. 16 **[[How weapons are represented in the discourses of
international politics,]{.mark} [how the contexts in which they are used
are portrayed,]{.mark} both by states using the weapons, and by
campaigners wishing to ban them, [matter in the practical politics of
weapons control.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[So too do the mundane
practicalities of international trade and the logics of states
supporting national industries; where trade trumps humanitarian concern
the logics of protest, and norm construction are made more complex, but
nonetheless they matter in the politics of all this.]{.underline}**17
**[They do so in part because [representational politics is part of the
politics of norm construction]{.mark} and crucially to the norm cascades
[that turn moral concerns into political campaigns]{.mark} that
formulate such things as the treaty to ban
landmines[.]{.mark}]{.underline}**18 **[The politics of this case was
driven by a reframing of landmines from weapons of war to indiscriminate
killers of the innocent.]{.underline}** Once formulated in these terms
their legitimacy was undermined and an international agreement to
prohibit their production and use gathered momentum. Such popular
protests and international campaigns get very difficult where
international campaigns run into the foreign policy priorities of
particular states, and where international campaigns are understood by
particular governments to be the foreign policy of other states by other
means. The classic example from the Cold War was the accusations from
both sides of the divide that peace movements on the other side were
concerned to undermine security.19 Our weapons, being purely defensive,
could never be a cause that sincere campaigners would tackle after all!
Drawing a line around a territorial designation to limit or restrict the
use or transport of particular weapons, usually nuclear ones, is a mode
of arms control. States have attempted to use these international
agreements to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons in many parts of
the world.20 Implicit in the spread of international nuclear weapons
free zones is the failure of the existing non-proliferation regime to
constrain the spread of nuclear weapons.21 In the 1980s the hope of
nuclear weapons free campaigners was that this territorial strategy
would gradually restrict the use and transport of nuclear weapons, and
in the process extend the international norms condemning these devices
in a manner that would bring political pressure to bear on the 44
CONTEMPORARY SECUR ITY POL ICY Downloaded By: \[Dalby, Simon\] At: 14:51
26 May 2011 superpowers to get serious about disarmament. While the
numbers of weapons in Russian and American inventories have decreased
dramatically from their Cold War levels, at least so far, the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty still seems to be more about maintaining the
political status quo than eliminating weapons. [What caused greatest
official concern in the United States in the period of the 1980s wasn't
the spread of nuclear weapons, but concerns that states would follow New
Zealand in declaring themselves nuclear free zones. This might offer
political constraints on the operation of US military forces, and this
mode of arms control was obviously a threat to superpower political
freedom of action in so far as international basing rights and rights of
passage were to be followed.]{.underline} The New Zealand arguments
suggested that the greater danger to New Zealand came from the existence
of these weapons and the potential use of them in major war.22 As such
the anti-nuclear campaign in the 1980s explicitly tackled the implicit
geopolitical rationalizations of nuclear strategy and the assumption
that American extended nuclear deterrence actually provided security.
Thus the clashing geopolitical premises of the debate suggest that the
geographical understandings of security that structure attempts to
control arms are far from innocent in this discussion. Indeed they seem
to be key to understanding which international agreements are negotiated
and why many apparently sensible moves that might reduce the risks of
conflict, or at least limit the casualties and damage should hostilities
occur, aren't made. **[[Such discussions focus attention on]{.mark} the
most obvious and taken for granted [assumptions about the geopolitical
order]{.mark} of our times, about [how the world political map is
structured and]{.mark} about [who is using violence for what
ends.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[In the aftermath of the discussions in
December 2009 in Copenhagen concerning climate change where promises of
a comprehensive agreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases so
spectacularly failed, and the continuous low level violence related to
the military actions of what President Obama refuses to call the War on
Terror, the big questions of the locus of political authority and what
kind of political order is emerging in the 21st century, are the
essential backdrop for any discussion of attempts to limit
arms.]{.underline}** Much of the discussion in the 20th century was
about limiting the proliferation of certain kinds of weapons, only most
obviously nuclear, chemical and biological ones. While there were
obvious humanitarian impulses to reduce the potential for violence there
was an overarching priority on the part of the superpowers to manoeuvre
in such a way that arms control didn't undermine their dominance in
international rivalries. Preventing weapons proliferating meant
maintaining strategic dominance during the Cold War. This crucial theme
has been perpetuated since in the military strategies of the remaining
superpower; the United States spends somewhere close to half of all the
total of the military budgets on the planet, and its military is
designed to be preeminent.

#### The House of International Relations dictates who ought to possess US arms, acquired through the legitimate means of sale, calculating legitimacy through a regime of white racial kinship that requires aspirations to the existing international order in order to become adopted in. Thus the House of IR is the foundation of the topic -- state and non-state actors alike must funnel their limited prescriptions of agency through the proper channels or else risk losing their kin. This process is gendered and racialized through the lens of the Western, white nuclear family.

Indonesia and Indochina under Dutch and French rule, respectively,
tracks the "genealogies of the intimate." She asks: how do racialized

colonial governance? Given the potent politics of categorizing
identities, Stoler examines "the histories of their making, the
exclusions they enabled, and violences they condoned" (Stoler 2002: 8).2
The House of IR exhibits a similar politics of exclusion and
violence.**[3 [It]{.mark} clearly [identiﬁes who's "in," who's "out,"

peculiarly "American social science" (Hoffman 1995), realism claims an
intellectual lineage that dates to ancient Greek history, especially
that recorded by Thucydides (5 bc) (cf. Lebow and Strauss 1991; Garst
1989; Jansson 1997; Monten 2006).5 Subsequently, realists have added
luminaries of power politics like Machiavelli and Hobbes to their
roster. But it was a generation of scholars from post-World War II
Europe, Britain, and the US that gave realism its distinctive voice.
**[Power, they asserted, reﬂects objective laws of calculated (sometimes

Hans J. Morgenthau each saw "political realism" as the cure to what they
considered the fateful cause of war among nations: "legalism,"

existence of an interdependent international political economy in a

anarchy and competition. [Game theoretic models explain]{.mark} such
[cooperation under anarchy as a prisoner's dilemma.]{.mark} Still, these
approaches preserve realism's basic premise in abstract
individualism.]{.underline}** **[[They place outside the realm of
realist inquiry]{.mark} issues like [ideology, the social bases of state
power, its practices, political struggles, and strategies for
reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Rupert 1995). **[Yet [realists
openly accept their origin in the white colonial/imperial
state.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They invoke and canonize Thucydides'
History of the Peloponnesian War as the genealogical text for IR. The
book details Athens' struggle against Sparta for hegemony in the ancient
world, interpreted by realists as a cautionary tale on the uses and
abuses of state power. **[[This teleological]{.mark} and political [move
disciplines IR,]{.mark} in effect, [by deciding who and what counts
in]{.mark} not just [the study of world politics but also its practices
through statecraft.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Accordingly, [some are
included, recognized, and legitimized at the cost of]{.mark} the
[many.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Realists constantly echo what they claim
to be Thucydides' key lesson in power: "The strong do what they can, the
weak suffer what they must." **[In this way, [realists rationalize
empire's brutal legacy, turning it into a]{.mark}n ideological and
[political commitment.]{.mark} Expect [violence and
colonization]{.mark}, some realists trumpet, for it [is integral to
empire.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And empire, they add, is what
international politics is all about. Conveniently silenced is another
reading of this text that tells of empire as a crisis not only for world
politics but the empire itself.6 **[[Realism stems from]{.mark} another
lineage, rarely acknowledged: i.e., the global capitalist economy.
[It]{.mark} accounts for realism's birth into the world and its growth,
sustenance, and eventual dominance in the House of IR.]{.underline}**
**[In turn, realism [generates]{.mark} an ideational [infrastructure for
global capitalism's public, political face: the modern, capitalist
state.]{.mark}]{.underline}** What is all this warring imperialism for
if not more wealth and resources for national elites? **[Global
capitalism delivers what the white colonial/imperial state seeds.
[Liberalism naturally allies with realism. They share]{.mark} common
[roots in the white colonial/imperial state and]{.mark} its relationship
with [global capitalism]{.mark}, albeit with a conceptual division of
labor]{.underline}**. **[Whereas [realism commands the House of IR by
focusing on]{.mark} the [state]{.mark} (["power"]{.mark})[, liberalism
organizes, manages, and reproduces it by emphasizing]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark} (["interest"]{.mark})]{.underline}** (see Gilpin 1987).
Liberalism started out as a proud tradition of deﬁance against
authority, such as Martin Luther's ﬁery repudiation of Catholic Church
hegemony in sixteenth-century Europe. Since then, it has evolved into an
ideological instigator of "free trade," "open markets," "instrumental
rationality," and other pillars of global capitalism (Polanyi 1944;
Hirschman 1977). **[Realism and liberalism work in tandem by drawing on
the mirage of "politics" and "economics."]{.underline}** Publicly, they
convince "contemporary statesmen \[like\] the mercantilists of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries \[that\] power is a necessary
condition for plenty, and vice versa" (Keohane 1984: 22). **[Privately,
[realism--liberalism maintains]{.mark} an infrastructure of [elite,
bourgeois rule by seeming to care about democratic peace, prosperity,
and freedom -- but not really.]{.mark}]{.underline}**7
**[[Realism--liberalism's abstract, ahistorical conceptions of the
state, the market, and the individual are bound by]{.mark} particular
[cultural expressions (Western, white, male) that result from]{.mark}
concrete [political struggles (bourgeois, colonial).]{.mark} [Yet both
the "world" (materiality, structured inequalities) and "politics"
(practices, discourse) disappear from world
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agathangelou 1997). Classical liberals
like Kant, Locke, and Woodrow Wilson, for instance, advocated a
legally-based "perpetual peace," "limited government," and a "league of
nations" to forestall global warfare that, by extension, preserves the
realist--liberal inter-state, commerce based system, in principle, if
not in form. Similarly, contemporary liberals like Hedley Bull (1966)
and David Held (1995) talk of an "international society" or
"cosmopolitan democracy," respectively, but without regard to the
worldviews or participation of Others in these processes. **[Today,
liberalism reinvents itself into a new family of arguments labeled
neoliberalism. Without losing the liberal logic of public vs private,
individual vs collective, Self vs Other, [neoliberalism professes good
intentions for the masses while complying with elite demands for new
ideas for and methods of preserving colonial--patriarchal--capitalist
structures and their necessary subjectivities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[Take the treatment of "third-world" women, for example. Liberal and
standpoint feminists end up colluding morally and politically when they
seek to "protect" brown women from brown men by helping them become more
like "white" women.]{.underline} Still, nothing is what it seems. As we
see below, mater liberalism and daughter neoliberalism each has sought
to convert Others with missionary zeal but ended up, instead, with
hybrid progeny. **[The good daughters of the House of IR exhibit
wonderful caretaking traits. Neoliberals seem to have resolved the
realist dilemma.]{.underline}**8 Economic "interdependence" (Keohane and
Nye 2000) and its institutional preference for negotiation and
continuity, they argue, account for "cooperation under anarchy" (Keohane
1984). **[That is, market relations raise the transaction costs of
conﬂict. Indeed, neoliberalism sets the market as the arbiter of all
social relations. It posits that corporate growth generates wealth,
employment, and prosperity -- all the necessary ingredients for social
order, with limited government interference to boot.]{.underline}** That
these strategies also extend US interests, norms, and practices -- i.e.,
a hegemonic regime (Stein 1984) -- is but a subsidiary consideration.
**[Neoliberalism turns realism's hegemonic stability theory into a
user-friendly manual for happy, consumer-based management. Gender
contestations within global capitalist crises push neoliberalism to
update itself.]{.underline}** For this reason, neoliberals ﬁnd
sister-solidarity with standpoint feminists (Keohane 1989). The latter
propose that "strong" objectivity would pertain when the "standpoints"
of various identities, especially those that have been excluded or
marginalized (e.g., black women), are taken into account (Harding 1991).
Of course, tensions strain any sibling relationship (Tickner 1997). But
neoliberals partner comfortably with standpoint feminists by
appropriating the latter for speciﬁc capitalist institutions and
practices. For instance, neoliberals claim an interest in promoting a
"network view that emphasizes how institutions could promote lateral
co-operation among organized entities, states, or otherwise . . ."
(Keohane 1989: 248). Standpoint feminism, as one neoliberal describes
it, seems the perfect wife/mother/hostess: it offers a "conceptual"
approach to IR that emphasizes "power as the ability to act in concert,"
allowing for "collaborat\[ion\] \[in the face of\] collective problems .
. . \[and\] purposeful human action and subjectivity in creating new
conditions of life . . . stressing connectedness, and obligations to
other inhabitants of planet earth . . ." (Keohane 1989: 245--251).9 But
where is gender analysis itself? Neoliberals and IR standpoint feminists
tend to equate "gender" with "women" (Carpenter 2002). This conﬂation
elides the role of men, masculinity, and patriarchy in the formation of
gender in social relations of power. **[In deﬁning gender normatively
("what is appropriate or useful, what is not"), they grant power to some
agents -- "good girls"]{.underline}** (Weber 1994) **[-- who can police
or mediate capitalist relations for others.]{.underline}** Martha
Nussbaum's "capabilities approach" offers one such example. Her focus on
capabilities shifts governmental action from what individuals should
think or do (which would amount to tyranny) to how they can accomplish a
more fulﬁlling life.10 Once society provides individuals with the basic
infrastructure to make choices, Nussbaum assures us, "the stage is fully
set" for an independent, well-informed, fulﬁlled life; the "choice is up
to them," she asserts (Nussbaum 1999: 45). In particular, she proposes,
the capabilities approach would free "third world" women of the
"shackles" of their thousand-year old traditions and beliefs (Nussbaum
2000), as if these have nothing to do with contemporary relations and
forces of power. Nussbaum's logic echoes an earlier era of missionary
authoritarianism. Insisting on the liberal norms of "personhood,
autonomy, rights, dignity, self-respect" (Nussbaum 1999: 56) as a
universal good, Nussbaum does not consider their interactions with other
norms, values, practices, histories, and institutions. She refers to a
group of feminists in China who reject Confucianism in favor of the
liberal norm of human rights, thereby highlighting liberal feminism's
international signiﬁcance. "What is East and what is West?" she asks
rhetorically (Nussbaum 1999: 9). Not once, though, does Nussbaum
consider the possibility that liberal theorists could beneﬁt from other
philosophical traditions, including Confucianism.11 Nor does Nussbaum
acknowledge her own adherence to a thousand-year-old tradition: i.e.,
what she claims to be Aristotelian logic. **[Because Nussbaum sees
"third-world traditions," particularly in their patriarchal form, as
obstacles to the full realization of personhood through choice, she
implicitly rationalizes their dismissal (to put it mildly) or extinction
(to put it more harshly)]{.underline}**. **[This "civilizing mission,"
Gayatri Spivak reminds us, is an old, colonial tale that does not bear
retelling]{.underline}** (Spivak 1999). [Nussbaum never reﬂects on her
privileged, masculinized position as a highly-educated, highly-paid
white woman from the US talking to "poor women" in India or China
subjected to "outdated patriarchies." Not only does she appropriate the
knowledge of these women, which is passed on at great risk and acquired
through lifetimes of physical, mental, and emotional labor, but she also
makes them the object of her writing and politics. Still, Nussbaum
pities them for not being "free" or "rich" enough to
speak.]{.underline}12 **[Ambivalence bedevils this colonial
logic.]{.underline}** Stoler's tale of white women in the colonies could
well substitute for the liberal, caretaking daughters of the House of
IR: "**[Charged with guarding cultural norms, \[these good daughters\]
were instrumental in promoting \[the House of IR\]. But it was partly at
their own expense, for on this issue they were to be almost as closely
policed as \[the Other\]]{.underline}**" (Stoler 2002: 60). **[For this
reason, while neoliberalism, liberal feminism, and standpoint feminism
may ﬁnd social and political emancipation appealing and a seeming basis
for solidarity with the Other, they are bound, nonetheless, to the
dictates of the House of IR.]{.underline}** [**[In the House of IR, the
Other refers to non-Western, non-white sources of knowledge, traditions,
or worlds.]{.underline}** **[These may be smuggled in as "servants" or
"wards" of the House but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[otherwise [not
recognized as legitimate subjects, knowledges,]{.mark} and/[or worlds in
their own right. Such alienation does not allow the House to formalize
connections between and among different producers of knowledge, although
informal cross-fertilizations ﬂourish even from]{.mark} the most
[unexpected sources]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One "delegitimized ward"
(D-ward), Asian capitalism, results from mater liberalism's consummation
with the Confucian world-order during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. The "delegitimized twins" (D-Twins), peripheral and
transitional economies, come from neoliberalism's contestations and
struggles with socialism in the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst
centuries. The same applies to the "delegitimized terrorist"
(D-Terrorist), al Qaeda, and its relations with neoliberalism,
especially since the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Detailed descriptions of each follow below but we come by way of the
legitimate heirs of the House of IR, beginning with neorealism. **[Son
#1 intrigues the most. Heir apparent to the House of IR, neorealism
springs not from the union of realism and liberalism but an open affair
between realism and its gold-digging neighbor, economics. Mistress of
her own house but impatient with opportunistic ambitions, economics
merges almost giddily with realism to produce neorealism.]{.underline}**
Waltz (1979), for instance, constructs the international system as a
market and states as individual ﬁrms, magically accounting for "order"13
without an "orderer"14 in an international system that is posited, a
priori, as anarchical. On this basis, Waltz infers that only great
powers matter since they alone account for change and consequence in
world politics**[. Similarly, neorealists and their cousins, rational
choicers, have stormed the House of IR.]{.underline}** Like Jimmy
Cagney's dying psycho gangster in White Heat (1949), they crow
manically: "Look, Ma, I made it! Top of the world!" **[They ﬁnd no
contradiction in denying legitimacy and rights to others, be these
involving intellectual debate,]{.underline}**15
**[hiring/promotion/grants,]{.underline}**16 **[or
publications,]{.underline}**17 **[while failing to deliver on their own
golden promises of, among others, "prediction," "law-like" regularities,
and "causal explanations"]{.underline}** (Green and Shapiro 1994). Yet
neorealists remain insecure. **[Their own zero-sum logic induces a
paranoid worldview that treats Others as competition only for legitimacy
and resources -- in this case, in the House of IR.]{.underline}** As
Stoler notes for colonial governance in southeast Asia, "**[it was not
the progeny of \[crosscategory\] unions who were problematic but the
possibility that they might be recognized as heirs to a European
inheritance .]{.underline}** . ." (Stoler 2002: 39). For this reason,
tensions between neorealism and the other progeny of the House of IR
remain severe.

#### The House of IR is premised on the existence of the sovereign subject, thereby reproducing the subject of politics as ontologically European, masculine, and propertied. The existence of this subject demands the construction of colonized zones and zones of gratuitous violence. Because only propertied subjects can come into political being within this House, its internationality presumes a universality that is not truly global in reach. In other words, the House of IR requires a segregated asymmetrical World order, licensing permanent war.

When Foucault began to write and joined the French communist party,
anti-colonial struggles and revolutionary projects were brutally evident
worldwide including Algeria. Fanon's famous book Black Skin, White Masks
(1967a) was published in 1952, two years before Foucault published his
dissertation (1954). But before this, Fanon fought as a Frenchman
against the Nazis. Macey (2000) writes that he was cited for
'distinguished conduct' and awarded the Croix de Guerre with a bronze
star. [Fanon's experience of French republicanism in Martinique, France
and Algeria convinced him that seeking to include/integrate slaves,
blacks, or the colonised within the historical strictures of imperial
political (universal) orders and their contingent humanist projects was
not viable because of their slave-racio-colonial underpinnings, or what
Achille Mbembe]{.underline} (2001: 24) [calls the imperial
commandment.]{.underline} Foucault published Maladie mentale et
personnalite ́ (1954) two years after the two major American political
parties put aside their differing geopolitical interests to support NATO
and other international institutions, recognising that such structures
could link the United States to the prevailing world order and expand
its influence worldwide (Kupchan 2009).3 In this work, Foucault
recognises that modernity (and its liberal humanist foundations) is a
problem. Even so, he is ambivalent about undertaking a genealogy
(Muppidi 2009; Grovogui 2007; Trouillot 2005)4 of the emergence of
liberal sovereignty to demonstrate that, historically, capitalism is a
zero-sum game in the exploitation of territories and peoples.
**[[Critical theorists in]{.mark} International Relations ([IR]{.mark})
such as Ashley (1988) and Weber (1999) recruit Foucault to understand
global power but remain mostly within the deconstruction of the liberal
interstate structure. IR Marxists problematise these analyses and others
that articulate the emerging global sovereignty as 'an international
state dominated by the US', not guided by a single biopolitical 'logic
of rule']{.underline}** (Kiersey 2009: 35). These **[IR Marxist
critiques are, thus, more concerned with the imperial genealogy of
globalisation and the American state's articulation and ordering of the
world.]{.underline}**5 **[While Foucault is critiqued by IR Marxists
regarding his theorisation of the formation of the imperial, he
demonstrated its connections with political economy, biopolitics, and
power in a series of lectures between 1975 and 1979: 'Society Must be
Defended', 'Security, Territory, Population' and 'The Birth of
Biopolitics']{.underline}** (Foucault 2004, 2008). **[Nevertheless, his
theorisations are embedded in the French liberal and a white supremacy
project, so that his analyses [are delimited by a universalisation that
is not truly global]{.mark}]{.underline}**6 **[[because it presumes the
structuring and subject of politics to be ontologically European,
masculine, and propertied.]{.mark} For instance, he does not explicitly
address French colonialism.]{.underline}** How do those who read his
texts today feel this silence? Said, for one, compares him to Fanon to
critique his narrowly French experience: 'Fanon represents the interests
of a double constituency, native and Western, moving from confinement to
liberation; ignoring the imperial context of his own theories, Foucault
seems actually to represent an irresistible colonizing movement that
paradoxically fortifies the prestige of both the lonely individual
scholar and the system that contains him' (Said 1994: 278). In
re-reading Foucault with Fanon,7 Said gestures to the limits of his and
other Western writers' work whose contributions are at once
indispensable and inadequate in their understanding of the realities of
(neo) colonial and global multiple worlds. Why is Fanon 'contestatory',
whereas Foucault is not? How are these contestations crucial for today's
struggles, specifically the crises of governance in the postwar liberal
international order? **[[What if our vantage]{.mark} point [in
critiquing practices, theories, and normative orders began with the
violence of the wretched,]{.mark} 'laying the groundwork for a theory of
antagonism']{.underline}** (Wilderson 2010: 7) **[[where demands and
claims cannot be satisfied by simply transferring ownership]{.mark} of
an organisation [within existing strictures]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Wilderson 2005: 7**[)[?]{.mark} [Fanon]{.mark} scales colonisation to
the level of the slave and colonised body. He illustrates the
incommensurability of the intimate encounter of black flesh with the
body of the coloniser and focuses on the structuring processes required
to make it possible. He [begins his critique with the]{.mark} normative
[imperial order of slavery and colonisation and]{.mark} those [humanist
interventions claiming to protect the sovereign subject.]{.mark} He
tells us that [the constitution of this]{.mark} sovereign [subject
depends on an asymmetrical segregated-order]{.mark}]{.underline}**: This
world divided into compartments, this world cut in two is inhabited by
two different species \... When you examine at close quarters the
colonial context, it is evident that what parcels out the world is to
begin with the fact of belonging to a given race, a given species . . .
The cause is the consequence; you are rich because you are white, you
are white because you are rich. (Fanon 1967d: 39--40, emphasis in
original) Fanon points out that this order's constitution depends on
direct violence that turns a species into slaves, black, and colonised.
**[[This violence makes it possible for zones to become 'civil' spaces
of]{.mark} 'generalized trust' and [security for]{.mark} the
[sovereigns; the species occupying them]{.mark} possess 'generalized
trust' and [are]{.mark} racially [white.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[This
relation ends up being taken for granted: [belonging to a given race of
property relations is the precondition for any 'civil'
encounter.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, as Wilderson argues, 'Fanon
makes clear how some are zoned, a priori, beyond the borders of
generalized trust' (Wilderson 2010: 33). **[[The establishment of
gratuitous violence zones, positions and constitutes simultaneously the
species and the colonised.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Further, 'the
condition of possibility upon which subjectivity' (Fanon 1967d: 39--40)
is based must be recognised and theorised. **[[The creation of colonised
zones, the interstate state system, racialised whiteness, and property
relations require theorising if we are to disrupt]{.mark} those
relations which unify and entify a [normative 'ethical
order']{.mark}.]{.underline}** Fanon, of course, is clear: without the
vertical existence of breath, that is, giving one's breath as
nourishment for blackness, slavery, and colonisation, there is no such
order. **[[This order, even when it claims inclusion, segregates
subjects of recognition from 'species'.]{.mark} [Subjects are positioned
into the interstate structure of worlds with sovereign protection, able
to take by force and accumulate anything, from things to life
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanon seems to have anticipated Foucault
who argues: 'Power is employed and exercised through a net-like
organisation. And not only do individuals circulate between its threads;
they are always in the position of simultaneously undergoing and
exercising power \... The individual \... is not the vis-a\`-vis of
power; it is I believe, one of its prime effects' (Foucault 1980: 98).
However, Fanon does not begin with this prime effect of power, as he
wants us to learn to read social relations, racism, and economies of
violence as if experiencing our own gratuitous violence, in an attempt
to think the impossible place of the slave, the black body, and the
colonised -- in other words, the living being whose existence is already
assumed as structurally impossible and, hence, as breath which can never
be synonymous with life. **[[The basis of the (inter) state
structure]{.mark}, Fanon recognises, [is]{.mark} already [the juristic
sovereign person who]{.mark}se essence, or what Goodrich calls the
sovereign that the state has a right to kill, [is already secured
from]{.mark} the threat of [mutilation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On the
one hand, Foucault (1990: 138) asks this about state power: 'How could
power exercise its highest prerogative by putting people to death, when
its main role was to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this
life in order?' On the other hand, Fanon makes explicit the matrix of
violence which requires and makes sure that species are zoned as black
and colonised: 'Individualism is the first to disappear \... the
colonialist bourgeoisie had hammered into the native's mind the idea of
a society of individuals where each person shuts himself up in his own
subjectivity, and whose only wealth is individual' (Fanon 1967d: 47):
Their first encounter was marked by violence and their existence
together -- that is to say the exploitation of the native by the settler
-- was carried on by a dint of a great array of bayonets and cannons.
**[The settler and the native are old acquaintances. In fact, the
settler is right when he speaks of knowing 'them' well. For it is the
settler who has brought the native into existence and who perpetuates
his existence. The settler owes the fact of his very existence, that is
to say, his property, to the colonial system.]{.underline}** (Fanon
1967d: 36) But why such insistence? What tension does Fanon want to
foreground? Fanon actually has a different 'locus of enunciation' and
insists on a long trajectory of the effects of the imperial, colonial,
and slave order and vertical relations of what he calls 'combat breath'
(Fanon 1967c: 65). **[By drawing out Fanon's idea of 'combat breath' and
articulating it as struggles that disrupt the practices of violence and
the final destruction of countries and people, we see that [enforcing
the right to life of the radical individual]{.mark} (the propertied man
of a structure of white supremacy which depends on slavery and
colonisation) [will authorise thanatopolitics and
necroeconomics,]{.mark} not by suspending a right to life but rather [by
enforcing a right to that 'liberal' life.]{.mark} But [this]{.mark}
minimalist right to life [could preclude crucial relations in the
everyday continuum-spaces of the human and the non- human]{.mark},
including ecologies [and it does by deploying practices of disfigurement
and destruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Fanon exposes the imperial
European re-assemblage of power and demonstrates that [state power
shifts are connected to the emergence of an 'international' order and
apparatuses that make possible a particular sovereign-master-colonising
subject.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In his view, colonial power says: 'Since
you want independence, take it and starve \... A regime of austerity is
imposed on these starving men; a disproportionate amount of work is
required for their atrophied muscles' (Fanon 1967d: 96). **[Fanon notes
the prevalence of suffocation and starvation in world politics, the
devouring of the flesh and the subsequent redistribution of its
existential vital energy that is turned into wealth]{.underline}**.
Amelioration requires more than changing working conditions and setting
up less exploitative structures (such as socialism and communism).
Rather, it requires 'regime\[s\] which \[are\] completely oriented
toward the people as a whole' which prioritise the principle 'that man
is the most precious of all possessions'.8 Such a locus will preclude
'that caricature of society where all economic and political power is
held in the hands of the few who regard the nation as whole with scorn
and contempt' (Fanon 1967d: 98). **[[War]{.mark}, for both Fanon and
Foucault, [is part of the violent process that makes it possible to
'rule over the ordering of the colonial world']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Fanon 1967d: 44). **[Fanon posits that war involves
politico-ontological claims whereas Foucault wonders about the war that
gave birth to the state. For him, '[peace itself is a coded war. We
are]{.mark} therefore [at war with one another; a battlefront runs
through]{.mark} the whole of [society, continuously and permanently,
and]{.mark} it is this battlefront that [puts us all on one side or the
other']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Foucault 2003: 50). He adds, 'war is both
the web and the secret of institutions and systems of powers' (2003:
110--11). For his part, Fanon knows that war's effects on the species
are horrendous. Fanon discusses the case of two Algerian boys, 13 and
14, who stab a European classmate to death, in order to make the point
that, like the European colonialist, the black slave may shirk his/her
humanity by pursuing violence to establish political equality. The
13-year-old describes the dead child as 'our best friend', targeted
simply because he was a friend and thus easily lured to his death. The
pair is remorseless. Fanon speaks of the racial tensions in this case
and recounts 'long conversations' with the 14-year-old, who describes
the murder as an act of revenge: 'I wanted to take to the mountains, but
I'm too young. So \[the other boy\] and I said . . . we would kill a
European'. 'Why'? 'In your opinion, what do you think we should have
done'? 'I don't know. But you are a child and the things that are going
on are for grown-ups'. 'But they kill children, too'. 'But that's no
reason for killing your friend'. 'Well, I killed him. Now you can do
what you like'. 'Did this friend do anything to you'? 'No. He didn't do
anything'. 'Well'? 'That's all there is to it'. (Fanon 1967d: 201) Many
theorists read these passages as confirmation that Fanon is a theorist
who incites violence and proposes it as the only option against
colonisation. Consequently, they underrate the extent to which Fanon, a
'dissident', considers it important to be present completely to the
slave-colonial order and its traumatic effects which are not easily
disentangled, good from bad. For him, this allows a nuanced
understanding of its genesis, violence, and offers the possibility of
transforming systems of valuation ranging from one's breath to universal
orders. In fact, in telling this story, Fanon makes visible the multiple
costs of slavery and colonialism. For him, imperialism is buried in the
bones of the native (Fanon 1967d: 40). He notes the costs of an imperial
and sovereign-democratic form of life, while insisting on the timing and
limitations of alternatives (such as national cultures): 'the violence
which has ruled over the ordering of the colonial world \... will be
claimed and taken over by the native at the moment when, deciding to
embody history in his own person, he surges into the forbidden quarters'
(Fanon 1967d: 40). He says that violence does not necessarily replace a
degraded slave with a self-actualised man. In essence, **[[Fanon invites
us to take a hard look at the myriad ways we avoid the inter-
existentially onto-politically-structured violence in our everyday
lives.]{.mark} Fanon begins his analysis of war by analysing slave and
colonial (structural) violence. For him, war is crucial, but which war?
Is it the distinction between enmity and war between brothers (war
between liberal and democratic states) and war against strangers, the
object of polemos?]{.underline}** **[Or is it the 'rational' war
calculated to enable a 'kind of stabilisation' in the interstate system
(among the colonial sovereign states themselves), thereby evading
questions about the doctrine of imperialism, its forced universal order
(currently led by the US), its reason, and the freedom of the
individual?]{.underline}** **[Fanon unequivocally answers by demanding
an inquiry into a fundamental process of world politics (including
imperial relations, colonial relations, and slave relations) ignored by
those who want to keep this order in place by violence]{.underline}**.
**[For Fanon, [it is not enough to talk of war and the subjects who
fight these wars,]{.mark} as [both war and racial bodies are already
technologies, inscribed in the economy of slave and colonial violence
through which]{.mark} the 'I' ([the subject]{.mark}) [attains
individuality within a politico-juridical order that enforces its
actuality antagonistically]{.mark}; the human body (and not sentient
flesh) and war are already vertically and horizontally positioned as
legitimate forms of human formation.]{.underline}** Fanon concisely
says: '**[Colonialism is not a thinking machine, nor a body endowed with
reasoning faculties. It is violence in its natural state']{.underline}**
(Fanon 1967d: 48). This requires more than biopolitical functions such
as managing bodies and things, life and wealth. Its fundamental grounds
are inter-antagonistically and inter-existentially set up. It is a
relationship that depends on the slave-colonial-racist dynamics that
create and systematically dehumanise and black(en) the person. Fanon
writes: 'the Black man has no ontological resistance in the eyes of the
white man' (Fanon 1952: 33). He adds: Colonialism . . . is violence in
its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater
violence. **[The policeman and the soldier, by their immediate presence
and their frequent and direct action, maintain contact with the native
and advise him by means of rifle butts and napalm not to budge. It is
obvious here that government speaks the language of pure force. The
intermediary does not lighten the oppression nor seek to hide the
domination; he shows them up and puts them into practice with the clear
conscience of an upholder of peace; yet he is the bringer of violence
into the home and into the mind of the native.]{.underline}** (Fanon
1952: 91) Fanon repeatedly articulates this antagonistic relationship as
if he wants to split asunder the dominant and normative belief that
slavery and colonialism consolidate politics to fit all desires and
serve the interests of all.

#### Pro-family discourses deployed by the US against the global South institutionalize colonial rule. The family has been weaponized as an arm in the arsenal of universality, denying the possibility of alternative social arrangements and privileging Western knowledge above all others.

The international pro-family movement

A **[US-driven theo-political]{.underline}** movement calling itself
**[['pro-family' is working to advance policy agendas in Africa, Eastern
Europe, India and Asia]{.mark} through]{.underline}** the establishment
of non-governmental organisations (**[NGOs]{.underline}**)
**[and]{.underline}** increasing advocacy work at **[the]{.underline}**
United Nations (**[UN]{.underline}**). As Croft (2007) and Martin (1999)
have revealed, **[[pro-family foreign policy involves measures
to]{.mark} '[strengthen the family]{.mark}' through opposition to birth
control]{.underline}**, the use of **[condoms]{.underline}** (even in
the fight against HIV/AIDS) **[and denial of]{.underline}** the
**[rights and dignity of sexual minorities.]{.underline}** Furthermore,
'Religious activists have consistently opposed any foreign-policy
initiative that might weaken parental control over children, facilitate
abortion, expand the rights of homosexuals, or devalue the role of the
conventional homemaker and mother' (Martin, 1999:74). The **[growing
influence of an international 'profamily' movement has been noted by
scholars who]{.underline}** have **[studied the [rise of discourses of
the 'natural' or 'traditional' family]{.mark} within domestic contexts
in the West at first]{.underline}**, and more recently their advances
within the UN **[and [across Africa and the Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Buss & Herman, 2003). Drawing on Christian
beliefs about the sanctity of marriage, pro-family organisations work to
actively 'preserve and promote' the nuclear family model, which is
positioned as the ideal kinship structure. For instance, **[the
[US-based]{.mark} organisation [Family Watch International works with
the UN and internationally to]{.mark}:]{.underline}**
**[[Preserve]{.mark} and promote [the family]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[based on marriage]{.mark} between a man and a woman as the societal
unit that provides the best outcome]{.underline}** for men, women and
children.1 Similarly, Focus on the Family -- which is US based but which
has associate offices in 13 other countries across Asia, Latin America,
Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- sets itself out as: a global
Christian ministry dedicated to helping families thrive. We provide help
and resources for couples to build healthy marriages that reflect God's
design, and for parents to raise their children according to morals and
values grounded in biblical principles.2 **[The
[WCF]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[a project of]{.mark} the
[Illinois-based Howard Centre]{.mark}]{.underline}** for Family,
Religion and Society, **[was established]{.underline}** in 1997 as an
initiative **[to consolidate]{.underline}** various **[pro-life and
anti-gay advocacy organisations]{.underline}**, and to bring together
global conservatives (and elites) who can advance 'family values' at the
levels of national and international policy. The **[WCF [gives global
expression to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the notion that **[the [nuclear
family]{.mark}]{.underline}** is **[[universal to all of humanity and
history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[arguing that the family
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** '**[[based on]{.mark} the [marital union of a
man and a woman]{.mark}]{.underline}**, is **[the bedrock of
society]{.underline}**, the **[strength of our nations]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** the **[hope of humanity]{.underline}** ... the
ultimate foundation of every civilization known to history'. 3 In 2016,
the WCF launched the International Organisation for the Family in Cape
Town, South Africa, where delegates signed the Cape Town Declaration,
confirming their efforts to 'firmly resis\[t\] every push to redefine
marriage: to include same-sex or group bonds, or sexually open or
temporary ones'. Prominent African signatories to the declaration
include the head of the African Christian Democratic Party, Kevin
Meshoe, and the Nigerian ambassador to South Africa, Uche Ajulu-Okeke. A
few months prior to this gathering, **[the WCF collaborated with the
Africa Organisation for Families]{.underline}**, the **[Kenya Conference
of Catholic Bishops]{.underline}**, the **[Kenyan Ministry of Labour and
Social Protection]{.underline}**, the **[Catholic Archdiocese of
Nairobi]{.underline}**, the **[Cameroon-based Global Institute for
Family Integrity and]{.underline}** the **[Nigerian-based Foundation for
African Cultural Heritage]{.underline}** (FACH) **[to host the African
Regional Conference on Families.]{.underline}** Anne Kioko, President of
the African Organisation for Families, explained that **[comprehensive
sex education was amongst the concerns of Kenyan pro-family
advocates]{.underline}**, arguing that such 'programs go way beyond
regular sex education and are designed to change all the sexual and
gender norms of society' (Nyambura, 2016). **[['Pro-family' discourses
advocating for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[nuclear family
model]{.mark} to be protected]{.underline}** in national and
international policy **[as the only legally recognised form of family
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[becoming [increasingly
influential]{.mark} with[in international policy debates]{.mark} and
imaginaries.]{.underline}** The growing influence of the pro-family
movement has been enabled not only by advocacy work in civil society and
politics, but also in academia. In the United States, for instance, W.
Bradford Wilcox (cited later in this article) is the Director of the
National Marriage Project, which is based at the highly ranked
University of Virginia. Other pro-family advocates who are based in
academic departments include WCF Founder Allan Carlson (Professor of
History, Hillsdale College), Mark Regnerus (Professor of Sociology,
University of Texas-Austin), Everett Piper (Oklahoma Wesleyan
University) and Monique Chireau (Duke University). Beyond universities,
a number of pro-family advocates work from US-based think tanks that are
notoriously conservative, including the Sutherland Institute, the
Witherspoon Institute, the Population Research Institute and the
Heritage Foundation. Increasingly, popular discourse across the
continent construes people who do not subscribe to the heterosexual
nuclear family model not only as 'unAfrican', but also as socially and
economically threatening to the developing state. **[Within these
discourses]{.underline}**, non-heterosexuals, single mothers and
childfree women, those who engage in pre-marital and extra-marital sex
and reproduction, and **[alternative family forms are
scapegoated]{.underline}** for various social challenges, and therefore
experience forms of oppression, namely marginalisation, victimisation
and exclusion (Young, 2009).

Decolonising the family

As Oyěwùmí (2002:1) writes, the **[enforcement and institutionalisation
of the European concept of the 'family' formed]{.underline}** the
**[ideological basis of gender and race]{.underline}** 'as two
fundamental axes along which people became oppressed' **[in colonised
African societies]{.underline}**. As one of the 'scientific designs' of
modernity, **[the nuclear family ideal was]{.underline}** not created
**[by]{.underline}** Africans but by Western **[Europeans and
Americans]{.underline}**, responding to the needs and visions of these
places, not those of Africa (Mignolo, 2011:130). **[As decolonial
scholars]{.underline}** (Smith, 2006; Lugones, 2007; Quijano, 2007;
Mignolo, 2011) **[reveal]{.underline}**, **[there is scope to decolonise
the family]{.underline}**, **[given that [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Christian and bourgeois **[[kinship model was an instrumental axis
through which colonial power was]{.mark} implemented
[institutionalised.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[control of sexuality
and gender]{.underline}** that this model enabled **[was reinforced by
European control of knowledge]{.underline}** (Quijano, 2007; Grosfoguel,
2013). Within the pro-family movement, the **[['logic of
coloniality']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Quijano, 2007) **[is [reinvigorated
in that]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[normative ways in
which]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[eurocentric nuclear family
model]{.mark} is used [reinforce western
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** while also protecting systems of
domination that can be legitimated through the nuclear family's
modelling of sexed and gendered hierarchies as natural.
Mid-twentieth-century literature on kinship in Africa (Hunter, 1936;
Krige, 1936; Schapera, 1940; Phillips, 1953; Reuter, 1963) largely
offered descriptive accounts that constructed African kinship systems as
located along a linear path of 'progression' towards 'advanced' family
forms associated with modernisation (Siqwana-Ndulo, 1998:408).
**[[Christonormative European thought constructed the gender binary and
hierarchy as]{.mark} evidence of [enlightened
society]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** any
other form of **[[indigenous sex and gender]{.underline}]{.mark}**
practice **[constructed [as 'savage']{.mark} and]{.underline}**,
further, **[as an indication of the need to evangelise and modernise
these societies]{.underline}** (Kitch, 2009). Howard Washington Odum's
1910 publication, Social and Mental Traits of the Negro, illustrates the
ways in which racist ideology drew on patriarchal constructions of
'civilization', reporting that 'in his home life, the Negro is filthy,
careless, and indecent ... as destitute of morals as many of the lower
animals \[and with\] little knowledge of the sanctity of home or marital
relations' (Stacey 1994:66). Such **[sociological and anthropological
scholarship on 'family']{.underline}** and kinship **[in Africa
provided]{.underline}** the **[[epistemic resources used to justify
conquest, colonisation]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}** of the
non-European world. Thus, **[colonised men were constructed as being
unable to govern colonised women]{.underline}**, and therefore unable to
govern themselves (Kitch, 2009). Employing the nuclear family model as a
means of measuring 'savagery' or 'civilization', enlightenment ideology
erected a system of racial classification and ranking through a
gender/sex hierarchical order that positioned male dominance as a signal
of cultural advancement (2009:56). African men, fated to become slaves,
were considered to lack fully formed souls, like women, and the
institution of marriage offered a gendered biblical model that could
justify the capture and enslavement of African people (2009:52). What
**[pro-family accounts of the universality of the 'nuclear
family']{.underline}**, such as those quoted earlier, further
**[obscure]{.underline}** is **[the extent to which African kinship
systems were destroyed throughout]{.underline}** the period of
**[colonial conquest.]{.underline}** At the same time that European
scholars were constructing African kinship structures as inferior
through the normative modern ideal of the nuclear family, they were
actively destroying the kinship systems of colonised people. The
**[[idealised western nuclear family model is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
therefore **[[implicated in economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[knowledge practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** of modernity that have
justified racism and constructed some human lives as inferior and
dispensable (Mignolo, 2011:6). Mignolo reinforces the salience of
heteropatriarchy within a power relations, arguing that a global
gender/sex hierarchy 'privileged males over females and European
patriarchy over other forms of gender configuration and sexual
relations' through the invention and institutionalisation of sex
(heterosexual/homosexual) and gender (male/female) binaries (Mignolo,
2011:18). Thus, 'a global racial/ethnic hierarchy that privileged
European people over non-European people' secured the privileged status
of European men over all men and colonised people, as well as European
women (2011:18). These **[[systems]{.mark} were held [in place by
privileging of western knowledges]{.mark} over non-western
knowledges]{.underline}** (which were often targeted for eradication)
**[[and]{.mark} a [spiritual]{.mark}]{.underline}**/religious
**[[hierarchy]{.mark} that privileged Christianity]{.underline}** over
non-Christianity and other non-western spiritualities (2011: 18).

#### The institution of the family is itself a weapon bought and sold in the project of conquest, antiblackness, heteropatriarchy, imperialism, and capitalism -- the white nuclear family as a dual processes of clearing and accumulation is sustained by the control and state power exercised through the family as a monopoly on the proper forms of kinship. The family must be abolished.

During the 1960s and 70s **[a cadre of Black women

with]{.underline}** a form of **[anti-capitalist, anti-racist,
anti-sexist]{.underline}**, at times **[anti-homophobic and decolonial

in]{.underline}** the anthology **[The Black Woman]{.underline}**
(1970). It is in her contribution to this volume that **[[Lindsey
deconstructs the family]{.mark} as a violent formation [and calls for
its abolition]{.mark}]{.underline}** as an institution. **[[Lindsey's
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the family departed from white
radical and lesbian feminist critiques in the sense that it
**[[linked]{.mark} the [family to antiblackness and
conquest.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It's **[intersectional analysis
reaches]{.underline}** far **[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}** a critique
of **[[patriarchy and capitalism implicating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
family in everyday forms of **[[imperial, genocidal and antiblack
violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Lindsey's **[[abolitionist critique
calls attention to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[ways]{.mark} violent
processes of [property accumulation]{.mark} [give white heteronormative
gender, sexuality and family]{.mark} formations [coherence and]{.mark}
secure [white ascendency through antiblack racism and Native
genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The American family is far from a
benign and innocent site of existence. Lindsey pens, "**[[The family
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[land on which it lived]{.mark} and
cultivated]{.underline}** its **[crops [became the man's
property]{.mark}]{.underline}**, man moved on to the seizure of the land
of others and his prisoners of war became his slaves. Upon this base,
**[the state evolved and empires were created.]{.underline}**"17 For
Lindsey, **[[the family is the core and animating unit of property
creation and]{.mark} of the [imperial state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
the essay, Lindsey connects family, land, slaves, property, state and
empire in order to situate the family within various forms of
historical, state and genocidal violence. Lindsey's indictment of the
family invites a spatial analysis of its power. **[The family as a
social formation can be reconcieved as an amalgamation of land, slaves,
property, conquest and the state.]{.underline}** The family could be
constructed **[as geopolitical unit or assemblage]{.underline}**
(family-land-slaves-property-state-empire) **[that creates the American
frontier]{.underline}**, or the time-space coordinates of the human. The
family as the geopolitical unit of women-children-land-slaves is a form
of property that can be accumulated. Specifically, **[[property is
accumulated through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[conquest]{.mark} of
Native people,]{.underline}** the theft of land **[[and]{.mark} the
[accumulation]{.mark} of slaves as property]{.underline}**. According to
Lindsey, family formation is a Western formation that is anti-Black.
**[[The family]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as a white
institution]{.underline}**, **[[has been held up to Blacks as]{.mark} a
[desirable but somehow unattainable]{.mark} goal]{.underline}**, at
least not in the pure form that whites have created. **[Witness [the
Black middle class]{.mark}]{.underline}** or pseudo-escapees into the
mainstream. **[This group [has]{.mark} assumed many]{.underline}** of
the **[institutional postures]{.underline}** of the oppressor, including
the so-called intact family, but even here we find **[a fantastically
[high divorce rate and frustration]{.mark} on]{.underline}** this
**[domestic level]{.underline}** has **[increased dissension between
individual Black men and women]{.underline}**, when **[it should instead
be a signal that [something is radically wrong with the model
they]{.mark} have chosen to [imitate.]{.mark}]{.underline}**18 For
Lindsey, **[[the family is a white institution.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[The family as a patriarchal unit of property]{.underline}**,
enslavement and conquest is not a priori to Black sociality. In fact,
Black people often fail in their attempts at replicating the formation.
**[[Lindsey calls for the entire model to be destroyed]{.mark} rather
than succumb]{.underline}** to the institution. We have an obligation as
Black women to project ourselves into the revolution to destroy these
institutions which not only oppress Blacks but women as well, for if
these institutions continue to flourish, they will be used against us in
the continuing battle of mind over body.19 **[[The institution of the
family is]{.mark} constructed as [a weapon that will be used in]{.mark}
the "[battle of mind over body]{.mark}."]{.underline}**20 Further,
**[Lindsey theorizes [the family as an organizing logic of]{.mark}
control and [state power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The family is not a
private space or a private matter for Lindsey. In fact, the family is
intimately connected to the state and animates its power. Lindsey
states, "**[The family has been used by]{.underline}** the **[white
agency to perpetuate the state]{.underline}**, **[and Blacks have been
used as extensions]{.underline}** of the white family,
**[as]{.underline}** the **[prisoners of war enslaved to do the dirty
work of the family]{.underline}**, i.e. the state. If the family as an
institution were destroyed, the state would be destroyed."21 As an
activist, Lindsey's work as an advocate for poor single Black mothers
made her acutely aware of the ways that the state constructed the notion
of the Black AFDC 'family'22 as a site of surveillance and intervention.
Lindsey reminds us that **[the [disciplinary power of the welfare state
has access to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[internal domestic space of
Black women]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or the Black matriarch's house). The
increase in state sanctioned surveillance prompted by The Report and
administered through a diffuse network of welfare case managers, monthly
reporting and documentation of sexual behavior, children, income and
daily activity was an issue and concern that weighed heavily on Kay
Lindsey. **[In The Report]{.underline}**, **[[Moynihan is
deploying]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[epistemologies]{.mark} and
tools [of sociological surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in order
**[[to make Black households transparent]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order
**[to assess whether they can be assimilated into]{.underline}** the
**[social and spatial formation of the family.]{.underline}** Patricia
Hill Collins (1989) argues that **[Moynihan erroneously conflates the
Black household with the Black family]{.underline}** when he wrote the
report.23 Hill Collins is making an argument for a more expansive notion
of family in Black life that cannot be contained within or reduced to
the empirical unit or data of the household. On the other hand, Lindsey
and contemporary Afropessimists would argue that it cannot be presumed
that there is such a thing as a 'Black family' in 1965 when the report
is drafted.

#### Thus the method: we demand the end of foreign military sales and direct commercial sales of the colonial household.

#### White racial kinship structures the nation state, white supremacist vigilantism, and liberal safety-pin wearing symbolic gestures of false allyship that refuse to put comfort, families, friends, and least of all lives--- on the line. The only thing that can be done is to remake the world through a refusal of white racial kinship.

"**[[SLAVERY is the ghost in the machine of
kinship]{.underline}]{.mark}**." **[Saidiya Hartman's concise
articulation gets to the heart of the ways that chattel slavery
continues to animate the present: transatlantic [chattel slavery's
constitution of domestic relations made kin in one direction, and in the
other, property]{.mark} that could be [passed between]{.mark} and among
[those kin.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[This is the ghost in the machine
of contemporary U.S. life and politics.]{.underline}** We can trace this
through the examples of U.S. Senator James Henry Hammond (1807-1864) and
U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond (1902-2003) and into the present. Hammond
claimed ownership over other people of what he called that "inferior
race," and Thurmond, a Dixiecrat, declared: "All the laws of Washington
and all the bayonets of the army cannot force \[...\] the southern
people to break down segregation and admit the Negro race into our
theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes, and into our
churches.'' Both were residents of Edgefield, South Carolina and both
"fathers" of Black women, slave and free, whom they never claimed as kin
in the ways that they would claim their white children. **[The laws of
U.S. chattel slavery and Jim Crow made white kinship (legally,
familially, and politically). These modes of [recognizing white kinship
and refusing to recognize Black personhood endure into the present; they
make and unmake persons and families, and assign human beings
value]{.mark} in and of themselves, [or not.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Thurmond's declaration encompasses not only Black people, but Latinx,
Muslim Americans and more. **[White kin in one direction, "property" in
another. [Whiteness]{.mark}, then, [is a political project.]{.mark}
[It]{.mark} is distinct from, but [often acts in concert with, the
political projects of making and sustaining nation, ethnicity, and
ethnic nationalisms.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Whiteness is a political
project and it is also a logic, by which I mean it is a calculus, a way
of sorting oneself and others into categories of those who must be
protected and those who are, or soon will be, expendable.]{.underline}**
**[[It is this calculus that allowed Dylan Roof to sit]{.mark}, for one
hour or more [with the]{.mark} welcoming [members of]{.mark} a Bible
study and prayer group at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal in
South Carolina ([the oldest AME church in the South]{.mark}), [and
then]{.mark} to show them his gun, to rise from his seat, [to slaughter
most of them]{.mark}, and to spare three so that they could "tell
everyone what happened." [It is this logic that allowed Dylan Roof's
friends to say nothing.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Those friends noted that
he seemed changed and "angry" but they asked him no questions when he
repeatedly broadcast his homicidal intentions in the weeks before he
massacred six Black women and three Black men. **[The logics of
[whiteness allowed him to be captured alive (by kin) and then taken to a
Burger King]{.mark} and fed because he said he was tired and hungry.
That whiteness and white supremacy are logics of making the human also
means that it is expected that the survivors of the massacre will offer
Roof their forgiveness. [White supremacists are
angry;]{.mark}]{.underline}** those who claim that title and those who
do not but who act in the interests of white supremacy. Not only are
they angry, but also "we" are told that their anger must be
understood--that "we" must make room for it. This "we" is across race,
sex, class, gender, and geography. **[[This unmoral, unethical anger has
the full support of the state.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[It is the only
anger]{.mark} that the state recognizes; the only anger [not
criminalized or met with deadly brutal force.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It
is the anger of Ryan and Ammon Bundy and the understanding of the jury
of their all-white peers that found them not guilty of the illegal
occupation and armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
**[[It is an unmoral anger that hits]{.mark} in the register and the
grammar of violence, [in the logics of law and order, in electoral
victories and the grammar of reconciliation with kin by any
means.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Many white people are struggling to
figure out if they should speak and what they might say to their white
kin]{.mark} now[,]{.mark} in this moment. (Kin here means, [all of those
recognized by the self--in some fundamental]{.mark}, indelible [way--as
being like the self]{.mark}.)]{.underline}** They are wondering if they
should be silent or if they should broach the election with their
intimates, with the people who are closest to them and who occupy
different points of view, who voted differently, who apprehend the world
in ways they self-report as deeply antithetical or inimical to their
own. **[They acknowledge that [the lives of people, not them, are at
stake.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They take to the streets to protest, and
yet some speak this fear of potential loss of kin into the same ether as
their co-workers, friends, and colleagues who are marked (as
Black/Muslim/refugee/Latinx/immigrant/LGBTQI/differently abled/Asian and
Native American/undocumented) and are in imminent danger. **[[They
equivocate at the thought and reality of losing kin, and at]{.mark}
probable [discomfort and pain;]{.mark} and in that interjacent space of
equivocation, they reconstitute and re-enflesh that ghost of a past that
is not yet past.]{.underline}** White people are searching for ways to
show solidarity to people of color and some have landed on the
performative symbol of wearing a safety pin. Symbols are important and a
safety pin is not enough. A safety pin is a temporary fix for a rend in
the fabric. **[One must be willing to say this is abhorrent. [One must
be willing to be more than uncomfortable. One must be willing to be on
the outside.]{.mark} [One must refuse to repair a familial rift on the
bodies cast out as not kin.]{.mark} Slavery is the ghost in the machine
of kinship. [Kinship relations structure the nation.]{.mark}

enfleshment of that ghost. [Refuse reconciliation to ongoing

visions of]{.mark} and approaches to [the material inequalities that
beset the world]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agathangelou 2004a). Steve Smith
(2004) concurs. Aus- tralia\'s aborigines, he points out, believe that
they \"sing\" their world into existence. In contrast, **[[IR
scholars]{.mark} seem much less wise, \"rarely reflect\[ing\] on who
wrote the words and the music \[of IR\], and virtually never listening
out for, nor recognizing, voices of worlds than our own until they
occasionally force us into silence\"]{.underline}** (Smith 2004: in
press). To begin our awakening, we need to theorize historically.
**[That is, our [analytical categories need to]{.mark} help us
distinguish and [explain]{.mark} particular historical forms of world
politics and social relations. Included must be \"some conception of
[how \[social relations\] might be implicated in the reproduction of
\[global\] systems]{.mark} in particular\"]{.underline}** (Rosenberg
1994:38). [[**For this reason, we turn to Worldism**.]{.mark} It begins
with five epistemological commitments: (1) intersubjectivity, defined as
institutionalized social structures that emerge through the labor of
agents in relation to other agents; (2) agency, which \"reverberates\"
with Others in a constant process of creating, articulating, and be-
coming; (3) identity, whose abstract subjectivity (e.g., notions of
Self) emerges from materiality (e.g., the body) and the social relations
of production that produce it; (4) critical syncretic engagement, which
fosters exploration and experimentation at the interstices of multiple
worlds where conflict and contestation most pressure the need for
negotiation, adaptation, and reformulation; and (5) accountability,
which stems from the Self\'s inescapability from the Other.]{.underline}
[These commitments differ from the House of IR\'s five main principles:
sovereignty, hierarchy, normality, legitimacy, and power.]{.underline}
Worldism does not deny the historical lineages that found the House of
IR. On the contrary, **[[Worldism historicizes the House]{.mark} itself
[as an effect of]{.mark} larger, structural inequalities in [global
capitalist- patriarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[In response, [Worldism
poses open-ended questions]{.mark}, not answers, [that shift IR from an
organizing principle of \"order versus disorder\" to that of
\"negotiation across difference\" to construct a common yet alternative
universe.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Worldism takes seriously Other
worlds by engaging with]{.mark} their [crises and contradictions, not to
convert or conquer them into another version of the
Self.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Worldism relates to the House of IR
accordingly: (1) Intersubjectivity Dissolves Sovereignty. **[Sovereignty
in the House of IR enables the declaration: \"I reside in the center,
you stay at the margins.\" This mode of political organizing silences
the problematic of ideologically territorializing and compart-
mentalizing communities into house versus state versus market versus
order versus disorder, as if these divisions do not sustain structurally
asymmetrical social relations.]{.underline}** \"Cooperation\" and
\"interdependence\" simply delude under these conditions. **[Worldism
asks, instead: \"How can we understand each other, especially our
relationally produced, differentially experienced positions, locations,
interests, and privileges?\" This open-ended query compels us to
recognize and accept multiple sources of knowledge and their worlds. [It
dismantles house boundaries]{.mark} and the constructions [that keep us,
literally and figuratively, in place.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Poetry
offers one means of doing so: Poetry envisions and revisions forms of
political life. Yet its closer emphasis on words sometimes
illuminates-recalls or reinvents-their narrative construction. That is
to say, it can highlight how words are not just narrative material but
\... can themselves have stories to tell \.... \[Poetry\] can help to
expose how the dominant world narratives we are called to accept and act
upon are in turn but a collage of word-stories forgotten, interpreted,
or synchronized to suit the rhe- torical moral of the grand narrative
(Constantinou 2000:287). **[By broadening the routes to voicing and
becoming, Worldism escapes narrow, fixed boundaries and the interests
they sustain. No longer must we tolerate bourgeois, patriarchal
authority passing for \"abstract individualism.\" Instead, [Worldism
foregrounds]{.mark} the fluid, dynamic landscape of mutual
understandings and [constant (re)constructions of who and what we
are.]{.mark} [From intersubjectivity]{.mark}, then, [we may develop
strategies to dissolve the House\'s fixation on and need for
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2) Agency Obsolesces Hierarchy.
**[Hierarchy stabilizes [the House]{.mark} (\"I live upstairs, you work
\[for me\] downstairs\"). It [relies on an epistemic violence that
denigrates Other sources of knowledge, traditions, and worlds even while
exploiting them for sustenance.]{.mark} [Such violence]{.mark} is not
unilateral. It [afflicts, also, those who luxuriate \"
upstairs.\"]{.mark} They must contend with the agony and anger of
disenfranchised progeny while worrying, at the same time, about access
to power and wealth in a constantly changing and contested
context.]{.underline}** Seen from this perspective, hegemonic stability
theory takes on a self-isolating, self-reifying character. In contrast,
**[Worldism asks: \"How do we affect our worlds?\"]{.underline}** It
focuses attention on the empowering, world-making role of all agents as
they reverberate off each other\'s identities and subjectivities,
desires and interests, power and histories. **[Recognizing that
production and reproduction, public and private, masculine and feminine
together contribute to a more integrated social life may, at last, free
us from an internalized oppression that deracinates and depoliticizes
both knowledge and power. [In helping us recognize that difference is
constituted through social relations,]{.mark} Worldism affirms that
identity is not immutable. [We are enabled]{.mark}, then, [to imagine
and develop different]{.mark} yet [interconnected
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Such community-building
disturbs and ultimately obsolesces hierarchy. (3) Identity Relativizes
Normality. **[The House of IR decides the norm (\"I set the standard,
you comply with it\"). It needs to keep in line \"rebel sons\" and
\"fallen daughters,\" not to mention \"bastard sons\" and a roaming
\"love child\" here and there. Like the actual colonial household, the
House of IR resorts to this tactic to deny its intimacies with exotic,
destabilizing Others, even when they produce common
progeny.]{.underline}** **[Worldism removes such alienation and
ambivalence by asking: \"How does my identity or self-understanding
emerge from interactions with others?\"]{.underline}** **[In this way,
we may engage with those intimate parts of ourselves, as individuals and
collectivities. Even during moments of fear and insecurity, we may risk
listening to, communicating with, and learning from those who seem so
different but who are really part of us and just as committed to making
our worlds better.]{.underline}** By sustaining healthy (nonparanoid,
noncovetous) communities that benefit the world\'s majority, Worldism
dynamizes and eventually relativizes the norm. (4) Engagement Supercedes
Legitimacy. **[[The House of IR needs to enforce legitimacy]{.mark} (\"I
am genuine, you are false at worst or an incomplete imitation at best\")
to uphold all its previous properties: [sovereignty, hierarchy, and
normality.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, legitimacy draws clear
boundaries around those who \"belong\" and those who don\'t, separat-
ing \"gentry\" from \"riffraff,\" \"high politics\" from \"low
politics,\" \"concepts\" from \"data,\" \"theorist\" from \"activist.\"
**[[What results]{.mark}, as we have seen, [is a]{.mark} camouflaged
[complex of erasures, violences, and desires]{.mark} that, nonetheless,
percolate to the public, especially when crises break the
routine[.]{.mark} [Relatively easy access to technologies of cruelty
through a globalized and commodified militarization further intensifies
the need for Worldism]{.mark}\'s next pair of questions: \"How can I
engage with Others-and myself-through critique?\"]{.underline}**24 And
equally important, \"how do I re- construct syncretically from this
critical engagement?\" **[[Critical, syncretic engagement across
borders, categories, and generations allows]{.mark} agents from
[multiple worlds]{.mark}-whether marked by tradition, race, class,
gender, or sexuality-[to build communities together.]{.mark} No longer
would we suffer from arbitrary exclusions, such as who needs education
(\"developing world\") and who does not (\"developed world\"). Nor would
we prevent the fruitful syncretism of laws, rules, and ideas from
multiple traditions and worlds. [The sheer joy of creative exploration
and experimentation derived from Worldism\'s critical, syncretic
engagement would help us supercede the banal legitimacy of house
rules.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (5) Accountability Reframes Power.
**[[Power determines the House of IR]{.mark} (\"I impose, you
consent\"). Without power, the house reminds us, we would tremble in a
scary state of nature where there is no shelter, no pater, no mater, and
definitely no servants. [This rationale loses its force when we consider
the insecurity that it produces despite a constant claim to the
opposite]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As the house reinforces its ramparts,
even \"inside\" members like postmodern feminism or
constructivism-pragmatism begin to seem threatening, not to mention
\"wards\" like Asian capitalism and pe- ripheral-transitional economies.
**[Here, [Worldism holds accountable those who erect, maintain, and
insist on such an establishment and]{.mark} ask: \"What are we think-
ing/doing/being, at whose cost, and why?\"]{.underline}** **[We are
moved to [interrogate the meaning and purpose of
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \"Whom does it benefit? Whom does it
sacrifice? Why should we mirror imperialism?\" From these queries, a
more meaningful and sus- tainable democracy may arise. It could involve
another conception of the \"house,\" its role and significance: If I
were to name the chief benefit of the house, I should say: the house
shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows
one to dream in peace \.... We can perhaps tell everything about the
present, but about the past! The first, the oneirically definitive
house, must retain its shadows. (Bachelard 1964:6, 13) Table 3 compares
these differences between the House of IR and Worldism. **[Many may
question our optimism. How could Worldism retain its intellectual and
political integrity given the power politics of the discipline as
outlined above?]{.underline}** Cynthia Weber (1999b:443) has noted that
mainstream IR tends to \"incorporate\" alien theories by turning them
into lesser, domesticated venues for \"enhanc\[ing\] scientific
disciplinary knowledges of IR rather than in any way transform\[ing\]
them.\" **[We cannot predict or control the course of an idea.
Contestations, contradictions, and crises will always follow.
Nonetheless, we suggest that Worldism offers a significant departure
from previous \"alien\" theories explored in IR.]{.underline}** First,
**[[Worldism does not simply talk about including Others but directly
integrates non-Western epistemologies and ontologies into
theory-building and political activism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Else-
where (Agathangelou and Ling 2004b), we discuss how poisies from ancient
Greece resonates with Buddhism\'s pratitya samutpada (co-dependent
arising). **[[When the Other voices itself, neither Self nor
Other]{.mark}, theory-building nor practical politics, [can remain the
same.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Even Osama bin Laden, whose
imperialistic rhetoric mirrors George Bush\'s, has changed IR by his
authorship of another voice, another vision, and another
politics.]{.underline}** **[Furthermore, Worldism aims to redress
structural and material asymmetries. It is not captured by elite
politics whether in the discipline, as a source of knowledge production,
or as a field of practical politics.]{.underline}** **[Rather, [Worldism
\"vivifies\" the perspectives, interests, and actions of those who are
usually marginalized, exploited, or exiled by the House of
IR.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In so doing, Worldism is alert to the
seductive yet ultimately self-delusional \"hyperreal\" politics
identified by some postmodernists (cf. Baudrillard 2002).
**[Furthermore, open-ended queries rather than declarative statements
drive Worldism. This orientation keeps [the House of IR]{.mark} in
perspective. It [becomes one of many sites, not the only one, at which
knowledge or politics is produced.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Lastly, as
shown by our tripartite analysis, IR is not limited to one arena, that
is, the discipline. Although consistencies align IR as a discipline with
its production of knowledge and implementation in practical politics,
change could occur at one site (e.g., knowledge production) with lagged
effects in the other two (e.g., the discipline, practical politics).
Indeed, Weber\'s observation of main- stream IR\'s supposed resilience
may be accurate for now but overly pessimistic in the long run. Our time
frame for making such judgments may be unnecessarily short. **[Worldism,
in brief, unleashes the poisies of IR.]{.underline}** **[[Worldism
openly declares its desire and interest to realize another world where
wealth would not accrue to a privileged few at the expense of the
many]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It would be a world, moreover, that
reflects col- laboration at all levels, \"out there\" and \"in here,\"
to sustain an open, inviting, and profoundly democratic environment that
is free of necessity and rich with poisies \"everywhere.\"

## 1AC -- REFUSE YOUR KIN (BLACK MATRIARCH) 

#### US foreign military sales and direct commercial sales of arms are premised on relational ties -- these bonds serve US self interests both economically and geopolitically, and contribute to a geospatial imaginary premised on territorial egoism.

**Perkins & Neumayer 10** \[R. Perkins & E. Neumayer. "The organized
hypocrisy of ethical foreign policy: Human rights, democracy and Western
arms sales." *Geoforum*, 42(2), 254-256 //tjb\]

**[Ideas of new beginnings, agendas and [spatial horizons have long been
a feature of]{.mark} the [geopolitical
imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agnew and Corbridge, 1995). Since
the early-1990s, one such imaginary (re-) scripted by Western political
elites is that they have moved away from the state-centric agenda of the
Cold War era, dominated by purely self-interested concerns for domestic
economy, security and power. **[[According to the rhetoric, a more
ethically-grounded foreign policy has taken]{.mark} its [place,
underpinned by universal moral principles]{.mark} and a commitment to
promote the protection of rights and freedoms of extra-territorial
citizens.]{.underline}** **[Critical geographers have been quick to
criticize [these]{.mark} and similar [socio-spatial imaginaries]{.mark}.
Amongst others, they have argued that such scripts [have]{.mark} often
[performed covert, instrumental roles.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[That
is, [rather than marking a more progressive]{.mark} moral [turn]{.mark}
in foreign policy action, [they are]{.mark} part-and-parcel of [a
discursive strategy]{.mark} which seeks [to legitimize existing security
agendas, economic interests and]{.mark} patterns of [domination over
space]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Flint and Falah, 2004; O'Loughlin and
Kolossov, 2002; ÓTuathail, 2000; Power, 2003; Roberts et al., 2003;
Sparke, 2007). In the present paper, we set-out to scrutinize the
alleged gap between political imaginaries and material outcomes, using
the example of Western arms exports to developing countries. **[Our
basic thesis is that [states' official commitment to a value-based arms
controls policy is]{.mark} largely a matter of [symbolic]{.mark}
politics [-- with countries reluctant to sacrifice national interests of
economy and security]{.mark} in name of []{.mark}protecting or advancing
the rights and freedoms of extra-territorial citizens.]{.underline}**
Using quantitative data on large weapons transfers from France, Germany,
the UK and the US over the period 1992--2004, we find evidence to
support our arguments. **[According to our statistical estimations,
[neither human rights abuses nor autocratic polity]{.mark} would appear
to [reduce the likelihood of countries receiving Western arms,]{.mark}
or reduce the relative share of a particular exporter's weapons they
receive. In fact, [human rights abusing countries are]{.mark} actually
[more likely to receive weapons from the US,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
while autocratic regimes emerge as more likely recipients of weaponry
from France and the UK. Reinforcing the impression that
extra-territorial ethical considerations are far from para- mount, **[we
show that [the geography of Western arms exports is]{.mark} closely
[aligned with self-interested, economically and geopolitically-important
relational ties.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Hence developing countries
which are more important trading partners exhibit a greater probability
of qualifying for arms, as generally do countries which fulfill the
domestic interests of the supplying state extra-territorially as
military allies. [Western countries have not]{.mark}, it seems,
systematically [acted counter to]{.mark} more [conventional, materialist
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our statistical estimations say
nothing about underlying causal- ity, but it would be difficult to
square the above findings with behavioural explanations based solely on
hegemony. If power were indeed the decisive variable, then the US should
logically be ex- pected to have shown a greater propensity to defy
international normative roles than the three European states, both in
the case of human rights and democracy. **[For sure, [the US hardly acts
in the spirit of its self-declared ethical
principles]{.mark},]{.underline}** but nor does France or the UK. Both
sets of countries have systematically contravened one principle or
another. Germany fares only slightly better with respect to democracy,
but not human rights protection. What seems to matter more, at least in
defining what states can or cannot get away with, are domestic
institutions (Donnelly and Liang-Fenton, 2004). That the US is more
willing to overtly ignore human rights abuses than autocratic government
is broadly consis- tent with the idea that the country is, first and
foremost, founded on democratic ideals rather than humanitarian ones
(Moss, 1995). Although far from irrelevant, the domestic appropriateness
of defending or promoting democracy in non-domestic spaces would appear
to be less deeply institutionalized in Britain and France than in the
US. **[Instead, [partly as a consequence of their historic role in
colonialism, norms of extra-territorial responsibility are]{.mark}
centrally [defined around human rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}**13 The
idea that domes- tic institutions matter is also supported by the German
case -- the country with the ''least bad" record regarding arms
transfers. Ger- many's foreign policy identity, which was formed in the
shadow of an excessively autocratic, militaristic and human rights
violating past, is one where economic or geostrategic concerns are least
likely to trump the promotion of Western values (Erb, 2003). What are
the implications of our findings? **[Most obviously, by
[exposing]{.mark} the [hypocrisy underlying]{.mark} geopolitical
imaginaries of [ethical foreign policy]{.mark}, they [remind us of the
importance of interrogating]{.mark} the [discursive constructions of
political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Flint and Falah, 2004;
ÓTuathail, 1992; Roberts et al., 2003). **[[While]{.mark} a [more
ethically-grounded foreign policy may script a geopolitics of
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sparke, 2007), **[[underpinned by]{.mark} a
deterritorialised [concern for the well-being of]{.mark} a more
spatially inclusive, [cosmopolitan humanity, our findings suggest
that]{.mark} such [socio-spatial narratives]{.mark} (potentially)
[conceal a geopolitics of territorial egoism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In
an important sense, therefore, our study speaks to wider debates about
the changing boundaries of the modern state. Although it has become
popular to talk about a blurring of domestic and foreign, and the
emergence of a post-sovereign state identity, the findings of the
present study suggest that it is important not to take this argument too
far. Aspirationally and rhetorically, Western countries may subscribe to
a non-territorial conception of rights and duties, and envision a state
whose interests lie in promoting universal values across borders. Yet if
the case of arms control is anything to go by, these universals have not
generally dislodged the primacy of national economic and geopolitical
interests. Far from the borderless world envisaged by hyperglobalists,
territorial borders would appear to continue to enframe economic and
geostrategic interests, and centrally guide Western states' foreign
policy actions (Yeung, 1998).

#### Normative political calls for arms control frequently take for granted the who, why, and how of arms control, securitizing space through an us/them dichotomy that frames the United States as a domestic homeland vulnerable to foreign threats. It is critical that we investigate the representational economy of arms control discourses, as taken for granted presuppositions about the foreign and domestic follow patterns of geopolitical thought that evacuate the global South from both policy and scholarly analysis and form the moral basis of political campaigns for and against arms control.

**[[Who controls which arms and why is essential to the]{.mark} future
[geopolitical order]{.mark} of the planet in so far as the threat of the
use of military force is part of the political calculus in coming
decades.]{.underline}** **[[The question of who controls arms is related
to where]{.mark} that ['who' resides.]{.mark} [The world, and how it
might be changed, does not look the same from Washington as]{.mark} it
does in [Tehran]{.mark}, nor [Cairo]{.mark}, [Moscow or Delhi]{.mark},
and [the]{.mark} common [assumption]{.mark}s [that]{.mark} the [American
dominance]{.mark} in geopolitical matters [is]{.mark} necessarily
[permanent isn't one that can be taken for granted]{.mark} in any
discussion of geopolitics for the 21st century.]{.underline}** A world
of sovereign equals, or one with a multiplicity of great powers would
apparently have a rather different set of arms control priorities than
one dominated by one superpower. The assumptions about a desirable world
order in the 21st century are not universally shared, but they matter
greatly as the premises of political conduct and the rationale for
foreign policy making in particular. The logic of American preeminence
was the key theme in the Bush Doctrine that dominated the first decade
of the century.1 There was a very distinctive notion of controlling arms
in its strategies of preeminence. Crucial in its innovations in American
thinking were the unavoidable necessities of dealing with globalization
and the clear recognition that the geopolitics of the 20th century had
been bypassed by new developments. And yet, despite the explicit
formulation of the geopolitical context as a matter of global war, some
very old-fashioned state rivalries persisted, not least the apparent
attempt to gain some form of nuclear strategic superiority over Russia,
and an explicit containment attempt on Iran ostensibly designed to stop
the regime gaining nuclear weapons. Arms control in that context was
about controlling arms that might challenge American hegemony. From the
beginning of the Obama administration in Washington in 2009 there was a
more obvious inclination to weapons reduction, and non-proliferation and
arms reduction themes reemerged in serious diplomatic discussion. An
ambitious agenda of comprehensive nuclear weapons test ban treaty
ratification in the Senate, a new strategic arms reduction treaty with
Russia, and the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons by strengthening the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty were all spelled out in a speech in
April 2009 in Prague.2 But less clear is how these policies will deal
with the apparently recalcitrant peripheral states in the world system
much less the 'nuclear outlaws' of India, Pakistan and Israel who more
or less operate outside the international regimes on these matters.
**[How all this fits into a reshaped geopolitical order in the longer
term is key to the question of what kind of arms control policies are
sought by whom and where.]{.underline}** Nor is it clear that the locus
of arms control initiatives is necessarily driven only by state
priorities. The most interesting point about President Obama's speech in
Prague is in the part that invoked his own political themes of change,
and change driven by popular demand. Invoking the experiences of both
the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Obama
suggested that popular demand for nuclear disarmament was crucial, that
the refusal to accept nuclear armed rivalries were key to the future of
geopolitics; [**[resistance is not useless]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It
is, he once again argued, essential to political change. **[But [change
to what kind of a world]{.mark} for the 21st century [is the question
that hangs over discussions of the technical practices of arms
control]{.mark} and the finer points of diplomatic
agreements[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[The other point that is [implicit
in calls for arms control]{.mark}, in President Obama's speeches, and in
very many other places, [is the]{.mark} crucial [specification of the
world as a dangerous place,]{.mark} and hence in need of arms
control[.]{.mark} But [precisely who is threatening to whom
where]{.mark} is frequently less clearly specified not least because it
[is]{.mark} frequently [taken for granted in political rhetoric.]{.mark}
But as the rest of this paper suggests, [focussing]{.mark} on those
taken for granted contextualizations, [on the implicit]{.mark}, and
sometimes explicit, [geographical framing of the world]{.mark} as
needing certain forms of arms control, [is a useful analytical way of
clarifying how the politics of arms control
works.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Many of the new innovations in Washington
retain the geopolitical assumptions of American hegemony. In Andrew
Bacevich's terms they follow the longheld foreign policy credo in which
American thinking has 'an abiding conviction that the minimum essentials
of international peace and order require the United States to maintain a
global military presence, to configure its forces for global power
projection, and to counter existing or anticipated threats by relying on
a policy of global interventionism'.3 Nonetheless, and this is the key
point in the rest of this paper, the geography of violence, and the
technological means of its application have changed very substantially
since the Cold War.4 **[Thinking through how these new circumstances,
only loosely caught in the terms 'globalization' on the one hand and
'human security' on the other, are tied into campaigns both by civil
society and states to control arms matters both as a matter of policy
and a matter of scholarly analysis of the new geopolitical circumstances
of the 21st century.]{.underline}** What is clear is that a combination
of the inter-related phenomena of urbanization, climate change,
migration, financial crises, technological innovation and the rapidly
shifting geography of global production is changing how geopolitics
works. The rise of multilateral institutions emphasizes how inadequate
nationalist political visions are in these circumstances, however
tempting they are for politicians mustering domestic support for various
policies. CR IT ICAL GEO POL IT IC S AND THE CONTROL O F ARM S 41

industrial warfare threaten destruction on a planetary
scale.]{.underline}** Peter Kropotkin's 19th century call for a
geography that dissipates prejudices and promotes peaceful cooperation
is now powerfully reinforced by the growing recognition in many places
that our fates are now much more obviously interconnected in a
globalized world. Arms control during the Cold War was to a very
substantial extent about controlling arms that might destabilize matters
in a crisis situation. Preventing situations where peripheral violence
might escalate to a superpower nuclear war was key to the efforts; so
too were the use of technological modes of verification. This was not
the whole story, but it was a dominant theme. **[After the Cold War this
mode of thinking is much less obviously the necessary framework for arms
control. Now the questions relate to larger questions of world order and
the locus of authority in a rapidly changing situation. But [old

seeking unilateral advantage by the control of arms cooperate uneasily
with social movement campaigners who frequently advocate the total
abolition of whole classes of weapons. Where arms are campaigned against
and why is the obvious first question that arises. Who organizes
protests, and who runs which political organizations is a related
question.11 Which weapons are owned and used by whom where and for what
ostensible reason matters too. Likewise, clearly in the case of land
mines and the recent agreement on cluster bombs, the questions of
victims, and the obvious point that weapons that violate the 'laws of
war' in particular by not discriminating between combatants and
civilians, are especially worthy of condemnation and hence being
controlled. Which states sign on, and which ones don't, and where
matters greatly. Critical geopolitics is about these contextualisations
of security, danger, fear and violence, and as such it should have much
to say because the details of arms control negotiations are so
frequently fraught with the overlapping problems that individual states
see in terms of complex threat perceptions in particular regions, only
most obviously in the case of the Middle East.12 **[This is not only a
matter of challenging the obviously self serving strategies of
attempting to accomplish unilateral disarmament by coercion as in the
cases of Iran and North Korea, but also a matter of the larger
discourses that assume the inevitability of eternal rivalry between
territorial states, part of why arms control appears to be a necessity
in the first place.]{.underline}** **[In quizzing the taken for granted
specifications of violence and its purported
geographies,]{.underline}**13 **[to tackle the implicit geopolitics that
structures the discussion of arms control, and in particular the fears
of proliferation that have preoccupied Washington so intensely in the
last few years, [a critical geopolitics]{.mark} should be able to
[suggest some lines of criticism that unsettle the dominant terms of the
arms control discussion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But, with the notable
exception of Spiegel and Le Billon's recent paper, little has been done
explicitly on arms control.14 The rest of this paper is thus a
preliminary exploration that suggests that explicitly thinking about the
contextual dimensions of arms control adds a critical edge to any
analysis of likely trends by bluntly asking the geographical questions
of precisely whom these policies benefit where. Looking to the
geopolitical contextualizations implicit, and sometimes explicit, in the
contemporary discussions of such things as strategic arms limitation,
the current angst over Tehran and nuclear technology, the question of
nuclear weapons free zones, the South Asia situation, and such things as
the international humanitarian campaigns against land mines and, more
recently, cluster munitions, emphasizes the importance of those
contextualizations in arms control discussions. CR IT ICAL GEO POL IT IC

26 May 2011 Arms Control Clearly arms control is a political process,
and a technical one too. After all it should never be forgotten that
states are very keen to control weapons they don't own or use but which
might be used against them, and not so keen on agreeing to binding
agreements to limit weapons that they obviously gain some perceived
advantage from deploying. Activists campaign for nuclear free zones, and
such things as international bans on the production and deployment of
land mines and cluster bombs, not least because they violate
humanitarian norms and the differentiation between combatants and
civilians. States seek the control of chemical and bacteriological
weapons among other things, but have a decidedly selective attention
span to weapons abolition. Nowhere more so than in the case of nuclear
weapons where comprehensive disarmament is the avowed goal of many
states but not a practical matter for most of those who have the
weapons.15 Geopolitical context explains much but not all of these
matters; threat perceptions and national pride matter too it seems and
as Ken Booth warned long ago, ethnocentrism continues to haunt strategic
matters. 16 **[[How weapons are represented in the discourses of
international politics,]{.mark} [how the contexts in which they are used
are portrayed,]{.mark} both by states using the weapons, and by
campaigners wishing to ban them, [matter in the practical politics of
weapons control.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[So too do the mundane
practicalities of international trade and the logics of states
supporting national industries; where trade trumps humanitarian concern
the logics of protest, and norm construction are made more complex, but
nonetheless they matter in the politics of all this.]{.underline}**17
**[They do so in part because [representational politics is part of the
politics of norm construction]{.mark} and crucially to the norm cascades
[that turn moral concerns into political campaigns]{.mark} that
formulate such things as the treaty to ban
landmines[.]{.mark}]{.underline}**18 **[The politics of this case was
driven by a reframing of landmines from weapons of war to indiscriminate
killers of the innocent.]{.underline}** Once formulated in these terms
their legitimacy was undermined and an international agreement to
prohibit their production and use gathered momentum. Such popular
protests and international campaigns get very difficult where
international campaigns run into the foreign policy priorities of
particular states, and where international campaigns are understood by
particular governments to be the foreign policy of other states by other
means. The classic example from the Cold War was the accusations from
both sides of the divide that peace movements on the other side were
concerned to undermine security.19 Our weapons, being purely defensive,
could never be a cause that sincere campaigners would tackle after all!
Drawing a line around a territorial designation to limit or restrict the
use or transport of particular weapons, usually nuclear ones, is a mode
of arms control. States have attempted to use these international
agreements to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons in many parts of
the world.20 Implicit in the spread of international nuclear weapons
free zones is the failure of the existing non-proliferation regime to
constrain the spread of nuclear weapons.21 In the 1980s the hope of
nuclear weapons free campaigners was that this territorial strategy
would gradually restrict the use and transport of nuclear weapons, and
in the process extend the international norms condemning these devices
in a manner that would bring political pressure to bear on the 44

26 May 2011 superpowers to get serious about disarmament. While the
numbers of weapons in Russian and American inventories have decreased
dramatically from their Cold War levels, at least so far, the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty still seems to be more about maintaining the
political status quo than eliminating weapons. [What caused greatest
official concern in the United States in the period of the 1980s wasn't
the spread of nuclear weapons, but concerns that states would follow New
Zealand in declaring themselves nuclear free zones. This might offer
political constraints on the operation of US military forces, and this
mode of arms control was obviously a threat to superpower political
freedom of action in so far as international basing rights and rights of
passage were to be followed.]{.underline} The New Zealand arguments
suggested that the greater danger to New Zealand came from the existence
of these weapons and the potential use of them in major war.22 As such
the anti-nuclear campaign in the 1980s explicitly tackled the implicit
geopolitical rationalizations of nuclear strategy and the assumption
that American extended nuclear deterrence actually provided security.
Thus the clashing geopolitical premises of the debate suggest that the
geographical understandings of security that structure attempts to
control arms are far from innocent in this discussion. Indeed they seem
to be key to understanding which international agreements are negotiated
and why many apparently sensible moves that might reduce the risks of
conflict, or at least limit the casualties and damage should hostilities
occur, aren't made. **[[Such discussions focus attention on]{.mark} the
most obvious and taken for granted [assumptions about the geopolitical
order]{.mark} of our times, about [how the world political map is
structured and]{.mark} about [who is using violence for what
ends.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[In the aftermath of the discussions in
December 2009 in Copenhagen concerning climate change where promises of
a comprehensive agreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases so
spectacularly failed, and the continuous low level violence related to
the military actions of what President Obama refuses to call the War on
Terror, the big questions of the locus of political authority and what
kind of political order is emerging in the 21st century, are the
essential backdrop for any discussion of attempts to limit
arms.]{.underline}** Much of the discussion in the 20th century was
about limiting the proliferation of certain kinds of weapons, only most
obviously nuclear, chemical and biological ones. While there were
obvious humanitarian impulses to reduce the potential for violence there
was an overarching priority on the part of the superpowers to manoeuvre
in such a way that arms control didn't undermine their dominance in
international rivalries. Preventing weapons proliferating meant
maintaining strategic dominance during the Cold War. This crucial theme
has been perpetuated since in the military strategies of the remaining
superpower; the United States spends somewhere close to half of all the
total of the military budgets on the planet, and its military is
designed to be preeminent.

#### The House of International Relations dictates who ought to possess US arms, acquired through the legitimate means of sale, calculating legitimacy through a regime of white racial kinship that requires aspirations to the existing international order in order to become adopted in. Thus the House of IR is the foundation of the topic -- state and non-state actors alike must funnel their limited prescriptions of agency through the proper channels or else risk losing their kin. This process is gendered and racialized through the lens of the Western, white nuclear family.

of IR, especially, another practice rules: the treatment of the
academy's institutional power as an extension of political power,
regardless of empire's devastations and/or secret
indulgences.]{.underline}** Our understanding of the colonial household
comes from Ann Laura Stoler (2002). Her study of colonial management in
Indonesia and Indochina under Dutch and French rule, respectively,
tracks the "genealogies of the intimate." She asks: how do racialized
categories of identity emerge and become naturalized into the lexicon of
colonial governance? Given the potent politics of categorizing
identities, Stoler examines "the histories of their making, the
exclusions they enabled, and violences they condoned" (Stoler 2002: 8).2
The House of IR exhibits a similar politics of exclusion and
violence.**[3 [It]{.mark} clearly [identiﬁes who's "in," who's "out,"
and who's precariously "on the border." It]{.mark} also [stratiﬁes who's

[realism heads the House]{.mark} of IR.]{.underline}**4 Though labeled a
peculiarly "American social science" (Hoffman 1995), realism claims an
intellectual lineage that dates to ancient Greek history, especially
that recorded by Thucydides (5 bc) (cf. Lebow and Strauss 1991; Garst
1989; Jansson 1997; Monten 2006).5 Subsequently, realists have added
luminaries of power politics like Machiavelli and Hobbes to their
roster. But it was a generation of scholars from post-World War II
Europe, Britain, and the US that gave realism its distinctive voice.
**[Power, they asserted, reﬂects objective laws of calculated (sometimes
amoral) self-interest for all states across time and
space.]{.underline}** John Herz, George F. Kennan, Walter Lippmann, and
Hans J. Morgenthau each saw "political realism" as the cure to what they
considered the fateful cause of war among nations: "legalism,"
"utopianism," and "idealism" (Keohane 1986: 9). **[[Abstract
individualism pivots realism's understanding of the world.]{.mark}
Primordial individual units ([states]{.mark}) [struggle in eternal
competition over resources]{.mark} that confer power and wealth. [In
this way, realists justify instrumental reasoning and
behavior.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But then how do realists explain the
existence of an interdependent international political economy in a
world of conﬂicting nation-states? Hegemonic stability theory comes to
the rescue (Kindleberger 1973). **[It posits a dominant state or hegemon
that willingly bears the asymmetrical cost of global leadership so the
inter-state system may survive peacefully and prosperously despite
anarchy and competition. [Game theoretic models explain]{.mark} such
[cooperation under anarchy as a prisoner's dilemma.]{.mark} Still, these
approaches preserve realism's basic premise in abstract
individualism.]{.underline}** **[[They place outside the realm of
realist inquiry]{.mark} issues like [ideology, the social bases of state
power, its practices, political struggles, and strategies for
reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Rupert 1995). **[Yet [realists
openly accept their origin in the white colonial/imperial
state.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They invoke and canonize Thucydides'
History of the Peloponnesian War as the genealogical text for IR. The
book details Athens' struggle against Sparta for hegemony in the ancient
world, interpreted by realists as a cautionary tale on the uses and
abuses of state power. **[[This teleological]{.mark} and political [move
disciplines IR,]{.mark} in effect, [by deciding who and what counts
in]{.mark} not just [the study of world politics but also its practices
through statecraft.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Accordingly, [some are
included, recognized, and legitimized at the cost of]{.mark} the
[many.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Realists constantly echo what they claim
to be Thucydides' key lesson in power: "The strong do what they can, the
weak suffer what they must." **[In this way, [realists rationalize
empire's brutal legacy, turning it into a]{.mark}n ideological and
[political commitment.]{.mark} Expect [violence and
colonization]{.mark}, some realists trumpet, for it [is integral to
empire.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And empire, they add, is what
international politics is all about. Conveniently silenced is another
reading of this text that tells of empire as a crisis not only for world
politics but the empire itself.6 **[[Realism stems from]{.mark} another
lineage, rarely acknowledged: i.e., the global capitalist economy.
[It]{.mark} accounts for realism's birth into the world and its growth,
sustenance, and eventual dominance in the House of IR.]{.underline}**
**[In turn, realism [generates]{.mark} an ideational [infrastructure for
global capitalism's public, political face: the modern, capitalist
state.]{.mark}]{.underline}** What is all this warring imperialism for
if not more wealth and resources for national elites? **[Global

[Liberalism naturally allies with realism. They share]{.mark} common
[roots in the white colonial/imperial state and]{.mark} its relationship
with [global capitalism]{.mark}, albeit with a conceptual division of
labor]{.underline}**. **[Whereas [realism commands the House of IR by
focusing on]{.mark} the [state]{.mark} (["power"]{.mark})[, liberalism
organizes, manages, and reproduces it by emphasizing]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark} (["interest"]{.mark})]{.underline}** (see Gilpin 1987).
Liberalism started out as a proud tradition of deﬁance against
authority, such as Martin Luther's ﬁery repudiation of Catholic Church
hegemony in sixteenth-century Europe. Since then, it has evolved into an
ideological instigator of "free trade," "open markets," "instrumental
rationality," and other pillars of global capitalism (Polanyi 1944;
Hirschman 1977). **[Realism and liberalism work in tandem by drawing on
the mirage of "politics" and "economics."]{.underline}** Publicly, they
convince "contemporary statesmen \[like\] the mercantilists of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries \[that\] power is a necessary
condition for plenty, and vice versa" (Keohane 1984: 22). **[Privately,
[realism--liberalism maintains]{.mark} an infrastructure of [elite,
bourgeois rule by seeming to care about democratic peace, prosperity,
and freedom -- but not really.]{.mark}]{.underline}**7
**[[Realism--liberalism's abstract, ahistorical conceptions of the
state, the market, and the individual are bound by]{.mark} particular
[cultural expressions (Western, white, male) that result from]{.mark}
concrete [political struggles (bourgeois, colonial).]{.mark} [Yet both
the "world" (materiality, structured inequalities) and "politics"
(practices, discourse) disappear from world
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agathangelou 1997). Classical liberals
like Kant, Locke, and Woodrow Wilson, for instance, advocated a
legally-based "perpetual peace," "limited government," and a "league of
nations" to forestall global warfare that, by extension, preserves the
realist--liberal inter-state, commerce based system, in principle, if
not in form. Similarly, contemporary liberals like Hedley Bull (1966)
and David Held (1995) talk of an "international society" or
"cosmopolitan democracy," respectively, but without regard to the
worldviews or participation of Others in these processes. **[Today,
liberalism reinvents itself into a new family of arguments labeled
neoliberalism. Without losing the liberal logic of public vs private,
individual vs collective, Self vs Other, [neoliberalism professes good
intentions for the masses while complying with elite demands for new
ideas for and methods of preserving colonial--patriarchal--capitalist
structures and their necessary subjectivities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[Take the treatment of "third-world" women, for example. Liberal and
standpoint feminists end up colluding morally and politically when they
seek to "protect" brown women from brown men by helping them become more
like "white" women.]{.underline} Still, nothing is what it seems. As we
see below, mater liberalism and daughter neoliberalism each has sought
to convert Others with missionary zeal but ended up, instead, with
hybrid progeny. **[The good daughters of the House of IR exhibit
wonderful caretaking traits. Neoliberals seem to have resolved the
realist dilemma.]{.underline}**8 Economic "interdependence" (Keohane and
Nye 2000) and its institutional preference for negotiation and
continuity, they argue, account for "cooperation under anarchy" (Keohane
1984). **[That is, market relations raise the transaction costs of
conﬂict. Indeed, neoliberalism sets the market as the arbiter of all
social relations. It posits that corporate growth generates wealth,
employment, and prosperity -- all the necessary ingredients for social
order, with limited government interference to boot.]{.underline}** That
these strategies also extend US interests, norms, and practices -- i.e.,
a hegemonic regime (Stein 1984) -- is but a subsidiary consideration.
**[Neoliberalism turns realism's hegemonic stability theory into a
user-friendly manual for happy, consumer-based management. Gender
contestations within global capitalist crises push neoliberalism to
update itself.]{.underline}** For this reason, neoliberals ﬁnd
sister-solidarity with standpoint feminists (Keohane 1989). The latter
propose that "strong" objectivity would pertain when the "standpoints"
of various identities, especially those that have been excluded or
marginalized (e.g., black women), are taken into account (Harding 1991).
Of course, tensions strain any sibling relationship (Tickner 1997). But
neoliberals partner comfortably with standpoint feminists by
appropriating the latter for speciﬁc capitalist institutions and
practices. For instance, neoliberals claim an interest in promoting a
"network view that emphasizes how institutions could promote lateral
co-operation among organized entities, states, or otherwise . . ."
(Keohane 1989: 248). Standpoint feminism, as one neoliberal describes
it, seems the perfect wife/mother/hostess: it offers a "conceptual"
approach to IR that emphasizes "power as the ability to act in concert,"
allowing for "collaborat\[ion\] \[in the face of\] collective problems .
. . \[and\] purposeful human action and subjectivity in creating new
conditions of life . . . stressing connectedness, and obligations to
other inhabitants of planet earth . . ." (Keohane 1989: 245--251).9 But
where is gender analysis itself? Neoliberals and IR standpoint feminists
tend to equate "gender" with "women" (Carpenter 2002). This conﬂation
elides the role of men, masculinity, and patriarchy in the formation of
gender in social relations of power. **[In deﬁning gender normatively
("what is appropriate or useful, what is not"), they grant power to some
agents -- "good girls"]{.underline}** (Weber 1994) **[-- who can police
or mediate capitalist relations for others.]{.underline}** Martha
Nussbaum's "capabilities approach" offers one such example. Her focus on
capabilities shifts governmental action from what individuals should
think or do (which would amount to tyranny) to how they can accomplish a
more fulﬁlling life.10 Once society provides individuals with the basic
infrastructure to make choices, Nussbaum assures us, "the stage is fully
set" for an independent, well-informed, fulﬁlled life; the "choice is up
to them," she asserts (Nussbaum 1999: 45). In particular, she proposes,
the capabilities approach would free "third world" women of the
"shackles" of their thousand-year old traditions and beliefs (Nussbaum
2000), as if these have nothing to do with contemporary relations and
forces of power. Nussbaum's logic echoes an earlier era of missionary
authoritarianism. Insisting on the liberal norms of "personhood,
autonomy, rights, dignity, self-respect" (Nussbaum 1999: 56) as a
universal good, Nussbaum does not consider their interactions with other
norms, values, practices, histories, and institutions. She refers to a
group of feminists in China who reject Confucianism in favor of the
liberal norm of human rights, thereby highlighting liberal feminism's
international signiﬁcance. "What is East and what is West?" she asks
rhetorically (Nussbaum 1999: 9). Not once, though, does Nussbaum
consider the possibility that liberal theorists could beneﬁt from other
philosophical traditions, including Confucianism.11 Nor does Nussbaum
acknowledge her own adherence to a thousand-year-old tradition: i.e.,
what she claims to be Aristotelian logic. **[Because Nussbaum sees
"third-world traditions," particularly in their patriarchal form, as
obstacles to the full realization of personhood through choice, she
implicitly rationalizes their dismissal (to put it mildly) or extinction
(to put it more harshly)]{.underline}**. **[This "civilizing mission,"
Gayatri Spivak reminds us, is an old, colonial tale that does not bear
retelling]{.underline}** (Spivak 1999). [Nussbaum never reﬂects on her
privileged, masculinized position as a highly-educated, highly-paid
white woman from the US talking to "poor women" in India or China
subjected to "outdated patriarchies." Not only does she appropriate the
knowledge of these women, which is passed on at great risk and acquired
through lifetimes of physical, mental, and emotional labor, but she also
makes them the object of her writing and politics. Still, Nussbaum
pities them for not being "free" or "rich" enough to
speak.]{.underline}12 **[Ambivalence bedevils this colonial
logic.]{.underline}** Stoler's tale of white women in the colonies could
well substitute for the liberal, caretaking daughters of the House of
IR: "**[Charged with guarding cultural norms, \[these good daughters\]
were instrumental in promoting \[the House of IR\]. But it was partly at
their own expense, for on this issue they were to be almost as closely
policed as \[the Other\]]{.underline}**" (Stoler 2002: 60). **[For this
reason, while neoliberalism, liberal feminism, and standpoint feminism
may ﬁnd social and political emancipation appealing and a seeming basis
for solidarity with the Other, they are bound, nonetheless, to the
dictates of the House of IR.]{.underline}** [**[In the House of IR, the
Other refers to non-Western, non-white sources of knowledge, traditions,
or worlds.]{.underline}** **[These may be smuggled in as "servants" or
"wards" of the House but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[otherwise [not
recognized as legitimate subjects, knowledges,]{.mark} and/[or worlds in
their own right. Such alienation does not allow the House to formalize
connections between and among different producers of knowledge, although
informal cross-fertilizations ﬂourish even from]{.mark} the most
[unexpected sources]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One "delegitimized ward"
(D-ward), Asian capitalism, results from mater liberalism's consummation
with the Confucian world-order during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. The "delegitimized twins" (D-Twins), peripheral and
transitional economies, come from neoliberalism's contestations and
struggles with socialism in the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst
centuries. The same applies to the "delegitimized terrorist"
(D-Terrorist), al Qaeda, and its relations with neoliberalism,
especially since the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Detailed descriptions of each follow below but we come by way of the
legitimate heirs of the House of IR, beginning with neorealism. **[Son
#1 intrigues the most. Heir apparent to the House of IR, neorealism
springs not from the union of realism and liberalism but an open affair
between realism and its gold-digging neighbor, economics. Mistress of
her own house but impatient with opportunistic ambitions, economics
merges almost giddily with realism to produce neorealism.]{.underline}**
Waltz (1979), for instance, constructs the international system as a
market and states as individual ﬁrms, magically accounting for "order"13
without an "orderer"14 in an international system that is posited, a
priori, as anarchical. On this basis, Waltz infers that only great
powers matter since they alone account for change and consequence in
world politics**[. Similarly, neorealists and their cousins, rational
choicers, have stormed the House of IR.]{.underline}** Like Jimmy
Cagney's dying psycho gangster in White Heat (1949), they crow
manically: "Look, Ma, I made it! Top of the world!" **[They ﬁnd no
contradiction in denying legitimacy and rights to others, be these
involving intellectual debate,]{.underline}**15
**[hiring/promotion/grants,]{.underline}**16 **[or
publications,]{.underline}**17 **[while failing to deliver on their own
golden promises of, among others, "prediction," "law-like" regularities,
and "causal explanations"]{.underline}** (Green and Shapiro 1994). Yet
neorealists remain insecure. **[Their own zero-sum logic induces a
paranoid worldview that treats Others as competition only for legitimacy
and resources -- in this case, in the House of IR.]{.underline}** As
Stoler notes for colonial governance in southeast Asia, "**[it was not
the progeny of \[crosscategory\] unions who were problematic but the
possibility that they might be recognized as heirs to a European
inheritance .]{.underline}** . ." (Stoler 2002: 39). For this reason,
tensions between neorealism and the other progeny of the House of IR
remain severe.

#### The House of IR is premised on the existence of the sovereign subject, thereby reproducing the subject of politics as ontologically European, masculine, and propertied. The existence of this subject demands the construction of colonized zones and zones of gratuitous violence. Because only propertied subjects can come into political being within this House, its internationality presumes a universality that is not truly global in reach. In other words, the House of IR requires a segregated asymmetrical World order, licensing permanent war.

When Foucault began to write and joined the French communist party,
anti-colonial struggles and revolutionary projects were brutally evident
worldwide including Algeria. Fanon's famous book Black Skin, White Masks
(1967a) was published in 1952, two years before Foucault published his
dissertation (1954). But before this, Fanon fought as a Frenchman
against the Nazis. Macey (2000) writes that he was cited for
'distinguished conduct' and awarded the Croix de Guerre with a bronze
star. [Fanon's experience of French republicanism in Martinique, France
and Algeria convinced him that seeking to include/integrate slaves,
blacks, or the colonised within the historical strictures of imperial
political (universal) orders and their contingent humanist projects was
not viable because of their slave-racio-colonial underpinnings, or what
Achille Mbembe]{.underline} (2001: 24) [calls the imperial
commandment.]{.underline} Foucault published Maladie mentale et
personnalite ́ (1954) two years after the two major American political
parties put aside their differing geopolitical interests to support NATO
and other international institutions, recognising that such structures
could link the United States to the prevailing world order and expand
its influence worldwide (Kupchan 2009).3 In this work, Foucault
recognises that modernity (and its liberal humanist foundations) is a
problem. Even so, he is ambivalent about undertaking a genealogy
(Muppidi 2009; Grovogui 2007; Trouillot 2005)4 of the emergence of
liberal sovereignty to demonstrate that, historically, capitalism is a
zero-sum game in the exploitation of territories and peoples.
**[[Critical theorists in]{.mark} International Relations ([IR]{.mark})
such as Ashley (1988) and Weber (1999) recruit Foucault to understand
global power but remain mostly within the deconstruction of the liberal
interstate structure. IR Marxists problematise these analyses and others
that articulate the emerging global sovereignty as 'an international
state dominated by the US', not guided by a single biopolitical 'logic
of rule']{.underline}** (Kiersey 2009: 35). These **[IR Marxist
critiques are, thus, more concerned with the imperial genealogy of
globalisation and the American state's articulation and ordering of the
world.]{.underline}**5 **[While Foucault is critiqued by IR Marxists
regarding his theorisation of the formation of the imperial, he
demonstrated its connections with political economy, biopolitics, and
power in a series of lectures between 1975 and 1979: 'Society Must be
Defended', 'Security, Territory, Population' and 'The Birth of
Biopolitics']{.underline}** (Foucault 2004, 2008). **[Nevertheless, his
theorisations are embedded in the French liberal and a white supremacy
project, so that his analyses [are delimited by a universalisation that
is not truly global]{.mark}]{.underline}**6 **[[because it presumes the
structuring and subject of politics to be ontologically European,
masculine, and propertied.]{.mark} For instance, he does not explicitly
address French colonialism.]{.underline}** How do those who read his
texts today feel this silence? Said, for one, compares him to Fanon to
critique his narrowly French experience: 'Fanon represents the interests
of a double constituency, native and Western, moving from confinement to
liberation; ignoring the imperial context of his own theories, Foucault
seems actually to represent an irresistible colonizing movement that
paradoxically fortifies the prestige of both the lonely individual
scholar and the system that contains him' (Said 1994: 278). In
re-reading Foucault with Fanon,7 Said gestures to the limits of his and
other Western writers' work whose contributions are at once
indispensable and inadequate in their understanding of the realities of
(neo) colonial and global multiple worlds. Why is Fanon 'contestatory',
whereas Foucault is not? How are these contestations crucial for today's
struggles, specifically the crises of governance in the postwar liberal
international order? **[[What if our vantage]{.mark} point [in
critiquing practices, theories, and normative orders began with the
violence of the wretched,]{.mark} 'laying the groundwork for a theory of
antagonism']{.underline}** (Wilderson 2010: 7) **[[where demands and
claims cannot be satisfied by simply transferring ownership]{.mark} of
an organisation [within existing strictures]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Wilderson 2005: 7**[)[?]{.mark} [Fanon]{.mark} scales colonisation to
the level of the slave and colonised body. He illustrates the
incommensurability of the intimate encounter of black flesh with the
body of the coloniser and focuses on the structuring processes required
to make it possible. He [begins his critique with the]{.mark} normative
[imperial order of slavery and colonisation and]{.mark} those [humanist
interventions claiming to protect the sovereign subject.]{.mark} He
tells us that [the constitution of this]{.mark} sovereign [subject
depends on an asymmetrical segregated-order]{.mark}]{.underline}**: This
world divided into compartments, this world cut in two is inhabited by
two different species \... When you examine at close quarters the
colonial context, it is evident that what parcels out the world is to
begin with the fact of belonging to a given race, a given species . . .
The cause is the consequence; you are rich because you are white, you
are white because you are rich. (Fanon 1967d: 39--40, emphasis in
original) Fanon points out that this order's constitution depends on
direct violence that turns a species into slaves, black, and colonised.
**[[This violence makes it possible for zones to become 'civil' spaces
of]{.mark} 'generalized trust' and [security for]{.mark} the
[sovereigns; the species occupying them]{.mark} possess 'generalized
trust' and [are]{.mark} racially [white.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[This
relation ends up being taken for granted: [belonging to a given race of
property relations is the precondition for any 'civil'
encounter.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, as Wilderson argues, 'Fanon
makes clear how some are zoned, a priori, beyond the borders of
generalized trust' (Wilderson 2010: 33). **[[The establishment of
gratuitous violence zones, positions and constitutes simultaneously the
species and the colonised.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Further, 'the
condition of possibility upon which subjectivity' (Fanon 1967d: 39--40)
is based must be recognised and theorised. **[[The creation of colonised
zones, the interstate state system, racialised whiteness, and property
relations require theorising if we are to disrupt]{.mark} those
relations which unify and entify a [normative 'ethical
order']{.mark}.]{.underline}** Fanon, of course, is clear: without the
vertical existence of breath, that is, giving one's breath as
nourishment for blackness, slavery, and colonisation, there is no such
order. **[[This order, even when it claims inclusion, segregates
subjects of recognition from 'species'.]{.mark} [Subjects are positioned
into the interstate structure of worlds with sovereign protection, able
to take by force and accumulate anything, from things to life
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanon seems to have anticipated Foucault
who argues: 'Power is employed and exercised through a net-like
organisation. And not only do individuals circulate between its threads;
they are always in the position of simultaneously undergoing and
exercising power \... The individual \... is not the vis-a\`-vis of
power; it is I believe, one of its prime effects' (Foucault 1980: 98).
However, Fanon does not begin with this prime effect of power, as he
wants us to learn to read social relations, racism, and economies of
violence as if experiencing our own gratuitous violence, in an attempt
to think the impossible place of the slave, the black body, and the
colonised -- in other words, the living being whose existence is already
assumed as structurally impossible and, hence, as breath which can never
be synonymous with life. **[[The basis of the (inter) state
structure]{.mark}, Fanon recognises, [is]{.mark} already [the juristic
sovereign person who]{.mark}se essence, or what Goodrich calls the
sovereign that the state has a right to kill, [is already secured
from]{.mark} the threat of [mutilation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On the
one hand, Foucault (1990: 138) asks this about state power: 'How could
power exercise its highest prerogative by putting people to death, when
its main role was to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this
life in order?' On the other hand, Fanon makes explicit the matrix of
violence which requires and makes sure that species are zoned as black
and colonised: 'Individualism is the first to disappear \... the
colonialist bourgeoisie had hammered into the native's mind the idea of
a society of individuals where each person shuts himself up in his own
subjectivity, and whose only wealth is individual' (Fanon 1967d: 47):
Their first encounter was marked by violence and their existence
together -- that is to say the exploitation of the native by the settler
-- was carried on by a dint of a great array of bayonets and cannons.
**[The settler and the native are old acquaintances. In fact, the
settler is right when he speaks of knowing 'them' well. For it is the
settler who has brought the native into existence and who perpetuates
his existence. The settler owes the fact of his very existence, that is
to say, his property, to the colonial system.]{.underline}** (Fanon
1967d: 36) But why such insistence? What tension does Fanon want to
foreground? Fanon actually has a different 'locus of enunciation' and
insists on a long trajectory of the effects of the imperial, colonial,
and slave order and vertical relations of what he calls 'combat breath'
(Fanon 1967c: 65). **[By drawing out Fanon's idea of 'combat breath' and
articulating it as struggles that disrupt the practices of violence and
the final destruction of countries and people, we see that [enforcing
the right to life of the radical individual]{.mark} (the propertied man
of a structure of white supremacy which depends on slavery and
colonisation) [will authorise thanatopolitics and
necroeconomics,]{.mark} not by suspending a right to life but rather [by
enforcing a right to that 'liberal' life.]{.mark} But [this]{.mark}
minimalist right to life [could preclude crucial relations in the
everyday continuum-spaces of the human and the non- human]{.mark},
including ecologies [and it does by deploying practices of disfigurement
and destruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Fanon exposes the imperial
European re-assemblage of power and demonstrates that [state power
shifts are connected to the emergence of an 'international' order and
apparatuses that make possible a particular sovereign-master-colonising
subject.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In his view, colonial power says: 'Since
you want independence, take it and starve \... A regime of austerity is
imposed on these starving men; a disproportionate amount of work is
required for their atrophied muscles' (Fanon 1967d: 96). **[Fanon notes
the prevalence of suffocation and starvation in world politics, the
devouring of the flesh and the subsequent redistribution of its
existential vital energy that is turned into wealth]{.underline}**.
Amelioration requires more than changing working conditions and setting
up less exploitative structures (such as socialism and communism).
Rather, it requires 'regime\[s\] which \[are\] completely oriented
toward the people as a whole' which prioritise the principle 'that man
is the most precious of all possessions'.8 Such a locus will preclude
'that caricature of society where all economic and political power is
held in the hands of the few who regard the nation as whole with scorn
and contempt' (Fanon 1967d: 98). **[[War]{.mark}, for both Fanon and
Foucault, [is part of the violent process that makes it possible to
'rule over the ordering of the colonial world']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Fanon 1967d: 44). **[Fanon posits that war involves
politico-ontological claims whereas Foucault wonders about the war that
gave birth to the state. For him, '[peace itself is a coded war. We
are]{.mark} therefore [at war with one another; a battlefront runs
through]{.mark} the whole of [society, continuously and permanently,
and]{.mark} it is this battlefront that [puts us all on one side or the
other']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Foucault 2003: 50). He adds, 'war is both
the web and the secret of institutions and systems of powers' (2003:
110--11). For his part, Fanon knows that war's effects on the species
are horrendous. Fanon discusses the case of two Algerian boys, 13 and
14, who stab a European classmate to death, in order to make the point
that, like the European colonialist, the black slave may shirk his/her
humanity by pursuing violence to establish political equality. The
13-year-old describes the dead child as 'our best friend', targeted
simply because he was a friend and thus easily lured to his death. The
pair is remorseless. Fanon speaks of the racial tensions in this case
and recounts 'long conversations' with the 14-year-old, who describes
the murder as an act of revenge: 'I wanted to take to the mountains, but
I'm too young. So \[the other boy\] and I said . . . we would kill a
European'. 'Why'? 'In your opinion, what do you think we should have
done'? 'I don't know. But you are a child and the things that are going
on are for grown-ups'. 'But they kill children, too'. 'But that's no
reason for killing your friend'. 'Well, I killed him. Now you can do
what you like'. 'Did this friend do anything to you'? 'No. He didn't do
anything'. 'Well'? 'That's all there is to it'. (Fanon 1967d: 201) Many
theorists read these passages as confirmation that Fanon is a theorist
who incites violence and proposes it as the only option against
colonisation. Consequently, they underrate the extent to which Fanon, a
'dissident', considers it important to be present completely to the
slave-colonial order and its traumatic effects which are not easily
disentangled, good from bad. For him, this allows a nuanced
understanding of its genesis, violence, and offers the possibility of
transforming systems of valuation ranging from one's breath to universal
orders. In fact, in telling this story, Fanon makes visible the multiple
costs of slavery and colonialism. For him, imperialism is buried in the
bones of the native (Fanon 1967d: 40). He notes the costs of an imperial
and sovereign-democratic form of life, while insisting on the timing and
limitations of alternatives (such as national cultures): 'the violence
which has ruled over the ordering of the colonial world \... will be
claimed and taken over by the native at the moment when, deciding to
embody history in his own person, he surges into the forbidden quarters'
(Fanon 1967d: 40). He says that violence does not necessarily replace a
degraded slave with a self-actualised man. In essence, **[[Fanon invites
us to take a hard look at the myriad ways we avoid the inter-
existentially onto-politically-structured violence in our everyday
lives.]{.mark} Fanon begins his analysis of war by analysing slave and
colonial (structural) violence. For him, war is crucial, but which war?
Is it the distinction between enmity and war between brothers (war
between liberal and democratic states) and war against strangers, the
object of polemos?]{.underline}** **[Or is it the 'rational' war
calculated to enable a 'kind of stabilisation' in the interstate system
(among the colonial sovereign states themselves), thereby evading
questions about the doctrine of imperialism, its forced universal order
(currently led by the US), its reason, and the freedom of the
individual?]{.underline}** **[Fanon unequivocally answers by demanding
an inquiry into a fundamental process of world politics (including
imperial relations, colonial relations, and slave relations) ignored by
those who want to keep this order in place by violence]{.underline}**.
**[For Fanon, [it is not enough to talk of war and the subjects who
fight these wars,]{.mark} as [both war and racial bodies are already
technologies, inscribed in the economy of slave and colonial violence
through which]{.mark} the 'I' ([the subject]{.mark}) [attains
individuality within a politico-juridical order that enforces its
actuality antagonistically]{.mark}; the human body (and not sentient
flesh) and war are already vertically and horizontally positioned as
legitimate forms of human formation.]{.underline}** Fanon concisely
says: '**[Colonialism is not a thinking machine, nor a body endowed with
reasoning faculties. It is violence in its natural state']{.underline}**
(Fanon 1967d: 48). This requires more than biopolitical functions such
as managing bodies and things, life and wealth. Its fundamental grounds
are inter-antagonistically and inter-existentially set up. It is a
relationship that depends on the slave-colonial-racist dynamics that
create and systematically dehumanise and black(en) the person. Fanon
writes: 'the Black man has no ontological resistance in the eyes of the
white man' (Fanon 1952: 33). He adds: Colonialism . . . is violence in
its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater
violence. **[The policeman and the soldier, by their immediate presence
and their frequent and direct action, maintain contact with the native
and advise him by means of rifle butts and napalm not to budge. It is
obvious here that government speaks the language of pure force. The
intermediary does not lighten the oppression nor seek to hide the
domination; he shows them up and puts them into practice with the clear
conscience of an upholder of peace; yet he is the bringer of violence
into the home and into the mind of the native.]{.underline}** (Fanon
1952: 91) Fanon repeatedly articulates this antagonistic relationship as
if he wants to split asunder the dominant and normative belief that
slavery and colonialism consolidate politics to fit all desires and
serve the interests of all.

#### Pro-family discourses deployed by the US against the global South institutionalize colonial rule. The family has been weaponized as an arm in the arsenal of universality, denying the possibility of alternative social arrangements and privileging Western knowledge above all others.

The international pro-family movement

A **[US-driven theo-political]{.underline}** movement calling itself
**[['pro-family' is working to advance policy agendas in Africa, Eastern
Europe, India and Asia]{.mark} through]{.underline}** the establishment
of non-governmental organisations (**[NGOs]{.underline}**)
**[and]{.underline}** increasing advocacy work at **[the]{.underline}**
United Nations (**[UN]{.underline}**). As Croft (2007) and Martin (1999)
have revealed, **[[pro-family foreign policy involves measures
to]{.mark} '[strengthen the family]{.mark}' through opposition to birth
control]{.underline}**, the use of **[condoms]{.underline}** (even in
the fight against HIV/AIDS) **[and denial of]{.underline}** the
**[rights and dignity of sexual minorities.]{.underline}** Furthermore,
'Religious activists have consistently opposed any foreign-policy
initiative that might weaken parental control over children, facilitate
abortion, expand the rights of homosexuals, or devalue the role of the
conventional homemaker and mother' (Martin, 1999:74). The **[growing
influence of an international 'profamily' movement has been noted by
scholars who]{.underline}** have **[studied the [rise of discourses of
the 'natural' or 'traditional' family]{.mark} within domestic contexts
in the West at first]{.underline}**, and more recently their advances
within the UN **[and [across Africa and the Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Buss & Herman, 2003). Drawing on Christian
beliefs about the sanctity of marriage, pro-family organisations work to
actively 'preserve and promote' the nuclear family model, which is
positioned as the ideal kinship structure. For instance, **[the
[US-based]{.mark} organisation [Family Watch International works with
the UN and internationally to]{.mark}:]{.underline}**
**[[Preserve]{.mark} and promote [the family]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[based on marriage]{.mark} between a man and a woman as the societal
unit that provides the best outcome]{.underline}** for men, women and
children.1 Similarly, Focus on the Family -- which is US based but which
has associate offices in 13 other countries across Asia, Latin America,
Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- sets itself out as: a global
Christian ministry dedicated to helping families thrive. We provide help
and resources for couples to build healthy marriages that reflect God's
design, and for parents to raise their children according to morals and
values grounded in biblical principles.2 **[The
[WCF]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[a project of]{.mark} the
[Illinois-based Howard Centre]{.mark}]{.underline}** for Family,
Religion and Society, **[was established]{.underline}** in 1997 as an
initiative **[to consolidate]{.underline}** various **[pro-life and
anti-gay advocacy organisations]{.underline}**, and to bring together
global conservatives (and elites) who can advance 'family values' at the
levels of national and international policy. The **[WCF [gives global
expression to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the notion that **[the [nuclear
family]{.mark}]{.underline}** is **[[universal to all of humanity and
history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[arguing that the family
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** '**[[based on]{.mark} the [marital union of a
man and a woman]{.mark}]{.underline}**, is **[the bedrock of
society]{.underline}**, the **[strength of our nations]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** the **[hope of humanity]{.underline}** ... the
ultimate foundation of every civilization known to history'. 3 In 2016,
the WCF launched the International Organisation for the Family in Cape
Town, South Africa, where delegates signed the Cape Town Declaration,
confirming their efforts to 'firmly resis\[t\] every push to redefine
marriage: to include same-sex or group bonds, or sexually open or
temporary ones'. Prominent African signatories to the declaration
include the head of the African Christian Democratic Party, Kevin
Meshoe, and the Nigerian ambassador to South Africa, Uche Ajulu-Okeke. A
few months prior to this gathering, **[the WCF collaborated with the
Africa Organisation for Families]{.underline}**, the **[Kenya Conference
of Catholic Bishops]{.underline}**, the **[Kenyan Ministry of Labour and
Social Protection]{.underline}**, the **[Catholic Archdiocese of
Nairobi]{.underline}**, the **[Cameroon-based Global Institute for
Family Integrity and]{.underline}** the **[Nigerian-based Foundation for
African Cultural Heritage]{.underline}** (FACH) **[to host the African
Regional Conference on Families.]{.underline}** Anne Kioko, President of
the African Organisation for Families, explained that **[comprehensive
sex education was amongst the concerns of Kenyan pro-family
advocates]{.underline}**, arguing that such 'programs go way beyond
regular sex education and are designed to change all the sexual and
gender norms of society' (Nyambura, 2016). **[['Pro-family' discourses
advocating for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[nuclear family
model]{.mark} to be protected]{.underline}** in national and
international policy **[as the only legally recognised form of family
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[becoming [increasingly
influential]{.mark} with[in international policy debates]{.mark} and
imaginaries.]{.underline}** The growing influence of the pro-family
movement has been enabled not only by advocacy work in civil society and
politics, but also in academia. In the United States, for instance, W.
Bradford Wilcox (cited later in this article) is the Director of the
National Marriage Project, which is based at the highly ranked
University of Virginia. Other pro-family advocates who are based in
academic departments include WCF Founder Allan Carlson (Professor of
History, Hillsdale College), Mark Regnerus (Professor of Sociology,
University of Texas-Austin), Everett Piper (Oklahoma Wesleyan
University) and Monique Chireau (Duke University). Beyond universities,
a number of pro-family advocates work from US-based think tanks that are
notoriously conservative, including the Sutherland Institute, the
Witherspoon Institute, the Population Research Institute and the
Heritage Foundation. Increasingly, popular discourse across the
continent construes people who do not subscribe to the heterosexual
nuclear family model not only as 'unAfrican', but also as socially and
economically threatening to the developing state. **[Within these
discourses]{.underline}**, non-heterosexuals, single mothers and
childfree women, those who engage in pre-marital and extra-marital sex
and reproduction, and **[alternative family forms are
scapegoated]{.underline}** for various social challenges, and therefore
experience forms of oppression, namely marginalisation, victimisation
and exclusion (Young, 2009).

Decolonising the family

As Oyěwùmí (2002:1) writes, the **[enforcement and institutionalisation
of the European concept of the 'family' formed]{.underline}** the
**[ideological basis of gender and race]{.underline}** 'as two
fundamental axes along which people became oppressed' **[in colonised
African societies]{.underline}**. As one of the 'scientific designs' of
modernity, **[the nuclear family ideal was]{.underline}** not created
**[by]{.underline}** Africans but by Western **[Europeans and
Americans]{.underline}**, responding to the needs and visions of these
places, not those of Africa (Mignolo, 2011:130). **[As decolonial
scholars]{.underline}** (Smith, 2006; Lugones, 2007; Quijano, 2007;
Mignolo, 2011) **[reveal]{.underline}**, **[there is scope to decolonise
the family]{.underline}**, **[given that [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Christian and bourgeois **[[kinship model was an instrumental axis
through which colonial power was]{.mark} implemented
[institutionalised.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[control of sexuality
and gender]{.underline}** that this model enabled **[was reinforced by
European control of knowledge]{.underline}** (Quijano, 2007; Grosfoguel,
2013). Within the pro-family movement, the **[['logic of
coloniality']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Quijano, 2007) **[is [reinvigorated
in that]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[normative ways in
which]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[eurocentric nuclear family
model]{.mark} is used [reinforce western
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** while also protecting systems of
domination that can be legitimated through the nuclear family's
modelling of sexed and gendered hierarchies as natural.
Mid-twentieth-century literature on kinship in Africa (Hunter, 1936;
Krige, 1936; Schapera, 1940; Phillips, 1953; Reuter, 1963) largely
offered descriptive accounts that constructed African kinship systems as
located along a linear path of 'progression' towards 'advanced' family
forms associated with modernisation (Siqwana-Ndulo, 1998:408).
**[[Christonormative European thought constructed the gender binary and
hierarchy as]{.mark} evidence of [enlightened
society]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** any
other form of **[[indigenous sex and gender]{.underline}]{.mark}**
practice **[constructed [as 'savage']{.mark} and]{.underline}**,
further, **[as an indication of the need to evangelise and modernise
these societies]{.underline}** (Kitch, 2009). Howard Washington Odum's
1910 publication, Social and Mental Traits of the Negro, illustrates the
ways in which racist ideology drew on patriarchal constructions of
'civilization', reporting that 'in his home life, the Negro is filthy,
careless, and indecent ... as destitute of morals as many of the lower
animals \[and with\] little knowledge of the sanctity of home or marital
relations' (Stacey 1994:66). Such **[sociological and anthropological
scholarship on 'family']{.underline}** and kinship **[in Africa
provided]{.underline}** the **[[epistemic resources used to justify
conquest, colonisation]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}** of the
non-European world. Thus, **[colonised men were constructed as being
unable to govern colonised women]{.underline}**, and therefore unable to
govern themselves (Kitch, 2009). Employing the nuclear family model as a
means of measuring 'savagery' or 'civilization', enlightenment ideology
erected a system of racial classification and ranking through a
gender/sex hierarchical order that positioned male dominance as a signal
of cultural advancement (2009:56). African men, fated to become slaves,
were considered to lack fully formed souls, like women, and the
institution of marriage offered a gendered biblical model that could
justify the capture and enslavement of African people (2009:52). What
**[pro-family accounts of the universality of the 'nuclear
family']{.underline}**, such as those quoted earlier, further
**[obscure]{.underline}** is **[the extent to which African kinship
systems were destroyed throughout]{.underline}** the period of
**[colonial conquest.]{.underline}** At the same time that European
scholars were constructing African kinship structures as inferior
through the normative modern ideal of the nuclear family, they were
actively destroying the kinship systems of colonised people. The
**[[idealised western nuclear family model is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
therefore **[[implicated in economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[knowledge practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** of modernity that have
justified racism and constructed some human lives as inferior and
dispensable (Mignolo, 2011:6). Mignolo reinforces the salience of
heteropatriarchy within a power relations, arguing that a global
gender/sex hierarchy 'privileged males over females and European
patriarchy over other forms of gender configuration and sexual
relations' through the invention and institutionalisation of sex
(heterosexual/homosexual) and gender (male/female) binaries (Mignolo,
2011:18). Thus, 'a global racial/ethnic hierarchy that privileged
European people over non-European people' secured the privileged status
of European men over all men and colonised people, as well as European
women (2011:18). These **[[systems]{.mark} were held [in place by
privileging of western knowledges]{.mark} over non-western
knowledges]{.underline}** (which were often targeted for eradication)
**[[and]{.mark} a [spiritual]{.mark}]{.underline}**/religious
**[[hierarchy]{.mark} that privileged Christianity]{.underline}** over
non-Christianity and other non-western spiritualities (2011: 18).

#### The institution of the family is itself a weapon bought and sold in the project of conquest, antiblackness, heteropatriarchy, imperialism, and capitalism -- the white nuclear family as a dual processes of clearing and accumulation is sustained by the control and state power exercised through the family as a monopoly on the proper forms of kinship. The family must be abolished.

**[the state evolved and empires were created.]{.underline}**"17 For
Lindsey, **[[the family is the core and animating unit of property
creation and]{.mark} of the [imperial state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
the essay, Lindsey connects family, land, slaves, property, state and
empire in order to situate the family within various forms of
historical, state and genocidal violence. Lindsey's indictment of the
family invites a spatial analysis of its power. **[The family as a
social formation can be reconcieved as an amalgamation of land, slaves,
property, conquest and the state.]{.underline}** The family could be
constructed **[as geopolitical unit or assemblage]{.underline}**
(family-land-slaves-property-state-empire) **[that creates the American
frontier]{.underline}**, or the time-space coordinates of the human. The
family as the geopolitical unit of women-children-land-slaves is a form
of property that can be accumulated. Specifically, **[[property is
accumulated through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[conquest]{.mark} of
Native people,]{.underline}** the theft of land **[[and]{.mark} the
[accumulation]{.mark} of slaves as property]{.underline}**. According to
Lindsey, family formation is a Western formation that is anti-Black.
**[[The family]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as a white
institution]{.underline}**, **[[has been held up to Blacks as]{.mark} a
[desirable but somehow unattainable]{.mark} goal]{.underline}**, at
least not in the pure form that whites have created. **[Witness [the
Black middle class]{.mark}]{.underline}** or pseudo-escapees into the
mainstream. **[This group [has]{.mark} assumed many]{.underline}** of
the **[institutional postures]{.underline}** of the oppressor, including
the so-called intact family, but even here we find **[a fantastically
[high divorce rate and frustration]{.mark} on]{.underline}** this
**[domestic level]{.underline}** has **[increased dissension between
individual Black men and women]{.underline}**, when **[it should instead
be a signal that [something is radically wrong with the model
they]{.mark} have chosen to [imitate.]{.mark}]{.underline}**18 For
Lindsey, **[[the family is a white institution.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[The family as a patriarchal unit of property]{.underline}**,
enslavement and conquest is not a priori to Black sociality. In fact,
Black people often fail in their attempts at replicating the formation.
**[[Lindsey calls for the entire model to be destroyed]{.mark} rather
than succumb]{.underline}** to the institution. We have an obligation as
Black women to project ourselves into the revolution to destroy these
institutions which not only oppress Blacks but women as well, for if
these institutions continue to flourish, they will be used against us in
the continuing battle of mind over body.19 **[[The institution of the
family is]{.mark} constructed as [a weapon that will be used in]{.mark}
the "[battle of mind over body]{.mark}."]{.underline}**20 Further,
**[Lindsey theorizes [the family as an organizing logic of]{.mark}
control and [state power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The family is not a
private space or a private matter for Lindsey. In fact, the family is
intimately connected to the state and animates its power. Lindsey
states, "**[The family has been used by]{.underline}** the **[white
agency to perpetuate the state]{.underline}**, **[and Blacks have been
used as extensions]{.underline}** of the white family,
**[as]{.underline}** the **[prisoners of war enslaved to do the dirty
work of the family]{.underline}**, i.e. the state. If the family as an
institution were destroyed, the state would be destroyed."21 As an
activist, Lindsey's work as an advocate for poor single Black mothers
made her acutely aware of the ways that the state constructed the notion
of the Black AFDC 'family'22 as a site of surveillance and intervention.
Lindsey reminds us that **[the [disciplinary power of the welfare state
has access to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[internal domestic space of
Black women]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or the Black matriarch's house). The
increase in state sanctioned surveillance prompted by The Report and
administered through a diffuse network of welfare case managers, monthly
reporting and documentation of sexual behavior, children, income and
daily activity was an issue and concern that weighed heavily on Kay
Lindsey. **[In The Report]{.underline}**, **[[Moynihan is
deploying]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[epistemologies]{.mark} and
tools [of sociological surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in order
**[[to make Black households transparent]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order
**[to assess whether they can be assimilated into]{.underline}** the
**[social and spatial formation of the family.]{.underline}** Patricia
Hill Collins (1989) argues that **[Moynihan erroneously conflates the
Black household with the Black family]{.underline}** when he wrote the
report.23 Hill Collins is making an argument for a more expansive notion
of family in Black life that cannot be contained within or reduced to
the empirical unit or data of the household. On the other hand, Lindsey
and contemporary Afropessimists would argue that it cannot be presumed
that there is such a thing as a 'Black family' in 1965 when the report
is drafted.

#### Thus the method: we demand the end of m ni,foreign military sales and direct commercial sales of the colonial household.

#### Black female sexuality, disorganized by the gender of the Black matriarch, refuses the family's assimilation of Black people into property. She refuses the production of the colonial household by refusing the propertied imperative, and therefore she is queer.

[[The Black matriarch head of household confounds and

colonialism. [Black women,]{.mark}]{.underline} no longer the property
of slave owners as technologies of plantation colonial settlement as
land clearers and producers of land clearers[, [become unintelligible to
settler colonial space making]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Post
emancipation, Black women are no longer property that reproduce the
settler colonial landscape[. [Black women must be incorporated into
other social formations]{.mark} off the plantation [that render them
property again. The family is a social formation that turns women into
property.]{.mark} [The Moynihan Report tries to impose the family onto
the Black matriarch's household]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark} render
women property and [produce]{.mark} them as [an intelligible form of
gender]{.mark} for settler colonial spatial practices]{.underline}. The
Black matriarch resists this property making institution[. [The settler
colonial social and spatial order produces genders, sexualities and
family formations that produce property]{.mark}]{.underline}. Normative
gender, [[sexuality and family formations create a heteronormative
social and spatial order that is conducive to the production of
property.]{.mark} [Property is required to]{.mark}]{.underline} occupy
and formally own or [[settle]{.underline}]{.mark} a space according to
the terms of what Carole Pateman calls the settler contract.
Heteronormative gender relations produce and enable property in multiple
forms. [Non heteronormative gender relations confound and prevent the
production and accumulation of property. [Black matriarchs disorganize
and upset the settler colonial and heteronormative thrust toward the
production of property.]{.mark}]{.underline} The unruly female [[gender
of the Black matriarch no longer functions as property or produces more
property]{.underline}.]{.mark} The sexuality of the Black female unwed
matriarch is unrestrained Black female sexuality. Black [female
sexuality that is not restrained [and]{.mark} disciplined [produces an
undisciplined and unruly Black surplus. The children of Black
matriarchs, as surplus populations, no longer function as
property]{.mark} as they did under enslavement.]{.underline} Not only do
[Black women's children not function as or make property (clear
plantation land]{.underline}) they represent the antithesis of property
during the Black Power era. [[Black children of Black matriarchs are
anti-property as they will likely destroy it.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
Kerner Commission as well as other sociological studies produced during
the 1960s hypothesized that urban unrest was due to poor parenting on
the part of Black matriarchs. [Black women's sexuality and reproduction
work outside of the normative linear progression]{.underline} of the
social and spatial orders that are oriented toward producing property. I
contend that the Moynihan Report reads [Black female sexuality as
non-normative and anti-property.]{.underline} I also argue that the
[[Black matriarchs]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Moynihan Report [[are
queered along the lines of the in/ability to create property which is
crucial to the maintenance of the settler colonial]{.mark} social and
spatial [order]{.mark}]{.underline}. Black matriarchs are queer/ed in
this historical moment because [their gender and sexuality work against
the creation of property which I argue is also a function of settler
sexuality]{.underline}. Non-normative or queer gender and sexuality for
the purposes of this project run along the axes of the logics and
production of property. The [[biopolitical management of Black
populations,]{.underline}]{.mark} which should be distinguished from
other racialized populations for analytical precision,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} wholly [[wrapped up in the possibility of
producing property in multiple forms.]{.underline}]{.mark} Queerness or
non normative gender and sexuality within settler colonial states
[should also be analyzed alongside of and within the logics of property.
[Normative settler gender and sexuality make property---as people,
commodities, land, and possession of
land---possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Property should be understood as
material, social, ideological, utopic and a site of desire[. [Property
is as much about the future as it is the pas]{.mark}t.]{.underline} In
fact, property at times conceals the past, particularly the conditions
of possibility that made it possible. Property required the elimination
of the Native people and enslavement of Black people. I want to make
sure that property is not understood as inert in the context of this
project. [Property certainly represents a visible
landscape]{.underline}. However, I would like to take up the landscape
of property as one that is always in, what Richard Schein would say, the
process of becoming. Property as a landscape (including people) also
functions as "discourse materialized."84 According to Nicolas Blomley
who provides a more Marxian account of its existence and purpose,
property is an enactment of power. The specific enactment of power is
the power to exclude.

#### Black feminism is situated at the nexus of blackness and transness -- that mode of living ruptures stable, fixed identities, subverting the humanism underlying the violence of the white propertied familial project.

[Often]{.underline} I think [we use Black feminism to create a politic
around sameness when what was being asked for was the ability
to]{.underline} work with and [mobilize around differences]{.underline}.
Of course, [the challenge being the need to]{.underline} always [defend
oneself]{.underline} or group [from]{.underline} [some other
force]{.underline} or category [that holds the power to deny the needs
of the different]{.underline} to secure the demands of itself. **[[Black
feminism has provided]{.mark} me with [the tools to understand that the
master's house]{.mark} is one that [must be dismantled,]{.mark} but [we
must learn how to use tools differently while also creating new
tools]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} a dynamic maneuvering is required
in order **[[to produce a paradigm shift that liberates
us]{.underline}]{.mark}** from both the freedoms and slaveries of our
current representational binds. **[[A rupture that will call forth new
worlds and new peoples that we do not have names
for]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that we may never have language for,
perhaps they may never be able to be hailed into this world. When you
say Black Feminism what do you mean? What do you think the relationship
between transgender studies and Black feminism as a field of study is?
Is there a relationship between Black cisgender women and transgender
people that you are interested in teasing out? MB: I am deeply
fascinated by your use of darkness here. Something to look forward to in
your forthcoming project, I suppose. And, to echo (with a difference)
your initial sentiment about the seeming circularity of this
conversation, I don't think it's circular but rather productively and
generatively becoming, perhaps un- and rebecoming. And
[this]{.underline}, I think, [is very much how you (and I) may think
**of [transness: continually reworked]{.mark} and reworking, open, [an
analytic that generates]{.mark} not totalizing knowledge but [more
proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** This conversation, this
dialogue, this discursive expression of love is enacting syntactically
and interpersonally what we're also trying to plumb through in its
content. And it's dope. But you ask what I mean by **[[Black
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From my perspective, it [**[is a
modality of thinking-doing-living that escapes fixity, subverts
hegemony, and is always open]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [It is an excessive
force]{.underline} that always overflows attempts to circumscribe it,
[that always is more than the containable]{.underline}. Black feminism
strikes me as, to cite, as you do, L.H. Stallings, [[a practice of
"unnaming]{.mark}": "a process of unranking [and challenging gender
through a manipulation of language]{.mark}]{.underline} to elide the
troubles and violations of language in the West"; [that which
"interrupt\[s\] the intelligible logic of gender, and ... continue \[s\]
to defer."]{.underline} **[[Black feminism]{.underline}]{.mark},** like
unnaming, "hinges on a subject's willful, infinite, multiple, and
continuous process of defying classification/naming."23 It does not
designate movement to somewhere; it is itself movement that perennially
uncovers and unmoors, a "loose \[and loosening\] seam." It **[does not
designate an ontological beingness; it is para-ontological, an agnostic
ontological imagination.]{.underline}** It does not designate anarchy in
search for something better; it is "wild" and "over and between sounds,
words, sentences, and narratives." [Black feminism]{.underline}, which
for me [always [indexes (fugitive) Blackness and
transness]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Saidiya Hartman says of Blackness,
"marks a social relationship of dominance and 450 Souls
October--December 2017 abjection and potentially one of redress and
emancipation; [it is a contested figure at the very center of social
struggle]{.underline}."24 But it is not only contested; it is
contesting, as it bristles, perennially, at all attempts to limn its
contours. Black feminism is a contesting and "contested idea, whose
ultimate destination remains unsettled," and this unsettled destination
is by necessity unknowable, unseen, and other than what is and has
been.25 "What is inadequate to" Black feminism "is already given
ontologies," Fred [Moten writes. "The lived experienced of blackness
\[and]{.underline} of those who engage [[Black feminism\] is ... a
constant demand for an ontology of disorder]{.underline}]{.mark}, an
ontology of dehiscence, [a para-ontology whose comportment will have
been (toward) the ontic]{.underline} or existential field of things and
events."26 I also look to Alexis Pauline Gumbs's conceptual frameworks
such as [[revolutionary mothering, Black feminist fugitivity, and "doing
cartwheels]{.underline}]{.mark} on the blacktop" as ways of
understanding Black feminism. And Gumbs, in fleshing out her own
understanding of it, [[inherits conceptual frameworks integral to Black
queer livability and flourishing]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as "combat
breathing" from Frantz Fanon and Ntozake Shange; or that Black women are
inherently valuable from the Combahee River Collective's Black feminist
statement; or queerness as unlikely, magical, and against the current of
the reproduction of oppression, a definition gleaned from the
interstices of Audre Lorde's intellectual corpus. [[Black
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}, Black feminist theorizing---theorizing,
of course, not in the sense of stodgy elitism but, as Barbara Christian
has said, "more in the form of the hieroglyph"---[seems to be that
force]{.underline}, that analytic[, that mode of inhabiting the world
that [refuses to succumb to hegemony.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is to take
seriously those conversations in the kitchen, those side-eyes saturated
with subversive meaning, those moments of, as Gumbs might say, spillage.
And this is what [Black feminism]{.underline} is and has done: it [is a
kind of living that is so immersed in refusal and subversive
song]{.underline}---different names for love, perhaps---[that it acts as
a potent site for change.]{.underline} Perhaps Black feminism is the
texture of the excess, the quality of the critical overflow that escapes
capture, one that must continually be remapped, undone, redeployed, and
worked, worked, worked. **[In short, [Black
feminism]{.mark},]{.underline}** rather than "is ... ," does, or more
specifically, **[[undoes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I see us dovetailing
here: you seek to decouple politics---a veritable doing---and **[stable,
fixed identities]{.underline}**; **[I seek]{.underline}**, too, **[to
promote a doing, a politics that rests not on an identity but on a
quotidian practice of refusal of fixity]{.underline}**, and on not
(simply) who one is per se but, following Cohen again, one's
relationship to power. I see it as **[a mode of thinking and doing that
troublesomely rests at the nexus of [Blackness and
transness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (because for me, as well as, I think,
for you, Black feminism is always already trans, as Che Gossett says)
**[and [mobilize]{.mark}s [the sites and moments of
rupture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, [those racial and gendered
breakdowns]{.underline}, which [are breakdowns of the category of the
human]{.underline}, or Sylvia Wynter's "Man," are generative sites in
Black feminism, and it is those unknowable, disruptive sites that are
the key to unlocking a capacity for justice. As this dovetails with
trans feminism, there is a necessary self-determination I want to
maintain as well. [The Blackness and transness of feminisms must be a
radical, self-determinative]{.underline} (which is unable to be thought
apart from trans epistemologies of \[un\]gendered self-determination)
[subjective utterance]{.underline} signaling General Articles 451 an
excess of categorization. What if **[[we understand these two modes of
living as]{.mark} gestures productive of [a profound overturning of the
identity category]{.mark} period]{.underline}**, excessive of
identificatory categorization, **[[precipitated by Blackness's
"excess]{.mark}, the power of the unthought]{.underline}**"?27 The zone
of the unthought, **[a Black queer feminist unrepresentability, marks
the limits of representation]{.underline}**. To put as fine a point on
this as I can, the relationship between Black feminism and trans
feminism, and those who do their bidding, is one that seeks to live in
what C. Riley Snorton aptly and lusciously calls "appositional flesh."28
Black feminism and trans feminism overlap referentially; [they index a
disruptive force that manifests]{.underline} and inflects in various
ways [across subjectivities]{.underline}. To aim for life in
appositional flesh might be [to "subjectivate" oneself outside of
power's grasp, despite power being constitutive of
subjectivity]{.underline}. [[It might be to render oneself illegible as
a kind of life]{.underline}]{.mark}, or to mobilize the "impossibility"
of oneself to the end of the world (as we know it). Maybe, just maybe,
**[[to be and become or to do and undo the irruptive nexus of Black
feminism and trans feminism is to live]{.mark} life unbounded by
hegemonic regimes, living [the radical liberation we strive for
now.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Making Sense of Homophobia in Africa Scholarly attention to homophobia
in Africa has largely drawn on intersecting anthropological,
sociological, historical, and political frameworks. These interrogations
have drawn heavily on feminist, gender, and queer theoretical insights
as well as the discourses and logic of human rights and democratic
citizenship. Through these various approaches, scholars have explicitly
located their respective intellectual projects within the struggle for
equal rights and recognition of sexual minorities. In the literature,
the [politics of knowledge and ignorance and the power relations
underlying them have emerged implicitly, but have not yet received
adequate attention.]{.underline} Engagements with knowledge-power and
ignorance in this context have primarily interrogated the increasingly
popular notion that homosexuality is "unAfrican."25 [Acknowledged as a
construction that depends upon the silencing and ignore-ance of the
reality of [same-sex intimacy]{.mark} and [partnerships in African
societies, denial of queer African genders]{.mark} and sexualities are
understood as having a "xenophobic logic"26 that is "[wielded rampantly
as a tactic for]{.mark} [othering]{.mark}]{.underline}."27 As Reddy
shows[,]{.underline} these views have translated into the denial of
citizenship rights on the basis of a particular sexual orientation
through the mobilization of moral panic that has no basis in evidence of
danger or consequence posed to the populace by same-sex practices.28
According to Ndjio, Afrocentric political doctrines "have been
instrumental in the effort of post-colonial nationalist elites to
constitute an exclusive African selfhood."29 [[These constructions have
focused on]{.mark} what he refers to as "[efforts to 'Africanize' the
sexuality]{.mark} of the masses [in a global
context]{.mark}."]{.underline}30 In Cameroon, Ndjio writes that these
discursive efforts have been widely successful in that "both men and
women have come to believe that in order to be 'good' citizens or 'real'
Africans, they have to . . . limit their sexuality solely to
heterosexual desires, but also have a natural aversion to other forms of
sexuality such as same-sex relations."31 [These critiques of [attempts
to essentialize sexualities in Africa]{.mark} provide important insights
into how denial of same-sex practices and partnerships within African
societies and their histories [have been produced **"on a**]{.mark}
**[mass scale for striking enforcements]{.mark},"**32 functioning to
exclude and victimize thousands across the continent. Constituting
sexuality as a structure of exclusion, political [leaders]{.mark}
promoting homophobic attitudes and legislation attempt to permanently
[fasten heteronormative identities to democratic values]{.mark} and
nationhood.]{.underline} These values serve not only heterosexist
privilege, but male privilege as well. According to Pharr, **[homophobia
is fundamentally created by [heterosexism]{.mark} "with its assumption
that the world is and must be heterosexual and its display of power and
privilege as the norm."]{.underline}**33 Heterosexism and homophobia,
she writes, "**[[work]{.mark} together [to enforce]{.mark}
[compulsory]{.mark} heterosexuality and that bastion of patriarchal
power, the [nuclear family," which]{.mark}, in turn, [is used to justify
male dominance]{.mark} over women at all levels of social
organization.3]{.underline}**4 Many African feminist scholars have
documented and theorized **[how heterosexism and patriarchy not only
oppressed women [and]{.mark} sexual minorities in the West, but also
[served as weapons of Western modernizing
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [British colonialism in Nigeria for
instance entrenched a system that explicitly privileged men and
disenfranchised women as "unable others" whose supposed subordinate and
inferior femininity cast male authority as the natural order of
things.]{.underline}35 As Izugbara writes, the colonial government
emphasized "able-bodied men" within criteria for employment as guides,
servants, tax collectors, cleaners, and stewards for the colonizers.36
This system continues in post-independence Nigeria, where
[[heteronormative "forms of]{.mark} sexual identity and [family life
have been]{.mark} discursively [produced as the norm, and]{.mark} made
to function as metanarratives for national identity]{.underline}."37 As
McClintock,38 Tamale,39 and Kitch show,40 heterosexist political values
were also justifications for European conquest. As Jackson demonstrates,
[colonial discourses of racial and gender difference [became fused
within European constructions of sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}.41
**[The ideologies of race, gender, and sexuality intersected in these
discourses, as sexologists of the late nineteenth century "drew on
fantasies of black female embodiment as their model of sexual deviancy
and gender nonconformity" in constructing "healthy" and "pathological"
sexualities:]{.underline}** Racial comparative-anatomy methods were used
to determine sexual definition, with a presumed similitude between
"deviant" white bodies and the black body. The word homosexual itself
seemed to conjure some anxieties about miscegenation, as the
"barbarously hybrid word" was a mix of Latin and Greek, even referring
to "shades of gender" and "sexual half-breeds."42 Here, Jackson makes
apparent the inextricability of raced, gendered, and sexed ideologies of
difference within colonial knowledge systems. In turn, the construction
of sexual deviance among African people became the constitutive "Other"
within middle-class European performances of respectability in the form
of monogamous, heterosexual marriage.**[43 [Within Western nation
building projects, it was believed that homosexuality weakened the
virility of the nation]{.mark}, while lesbianism compromised women's
ability and desire to produce the next generation of patriots who would
expand the empire further into Africa.]{.underline}**44 [Thus,
homosexuality was not only [constructed as "sick" and]{.mark} "sinful,"
but as [politically and economically dangerous]{.mark} too. As current
Western conquests into African sexual politics reveal, the control,
regulation, and reproduction of a nation's population through sexual
regulation endures as a mechanism of reproducing global inequalities of
power.]{.underline}

#### The white settler family exists in a time and spatial category created out of the natal alienation and genocide of Native and Black people that prevents the "Black family's" existence and therefore opens Black socialities to diagnosis, surveillance, and violence.

Due to the way that ethnicity functions in the report and within the
liberal discourse of the times [[there]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [no
discursive opening for an analysis of the ways that the white Settler
family becomes possible]{.mark} only [through the negation of the Black
household and Native peoples.]{.mark} According to Spillers, "Under the
Moynihan rule[, "ethnicity" itself identifies a total objectification of
human and cultural motives]{.mark}]{.underline}."Negro families and
white families function in bounded and hard opposition to one another.
They are also timeless and static and have no relation to one another.
"Apparently spontaneous, these "actants" \[White and Black families\]
are wholly generated, with neither past nor future as tribal currents
moving out of time[. Moynihan's ["Families" are always in a pure present
and always tense.]{.mark} "Ethnicity" in this case freezes in meaning,
takes on constancy, assumes the look and the affect of the Eternal. The
centuries long process of [making the Negro and the Negro family the
negation of the White family is not acknowledged by civil
society]{.mark} or Moynihan[, and]{.mark} therefore [cannot]{.mark} [be
perceived]{.mark} or tracked in the report. [Slavery and]{.mark}
[conquest as dynamic, historical and ongoing process]{.mark}es [of
negation that ethnicize or racialize people are impossible to
register]{.mark} in this report[. Ethnicity is a hard,]{.mark}
uninterruptable [process that cannot be]{.mark} [prevented. Ethnicity is
turned into a "consequence]{.mark}" in the report.]{.underline} As a
consequence it functions as an end point; just an inert sociological
variable to be studied. The [[ethnicity invoked in the Moynihan report,
according to Spillers, is a "powerful stillness" that "embodies nothing
more than a mode of memorial time.]{.mark}"Essential [ethnic difference
is not a social process, it merely exists]{.mark} and shows up [as a
consequence]{.mark}. The historical and [ongoing]{.mark} processes of
[genocide]{.mark} and slavery [that made whites, Blacks and Natives in
relation to one another]{.mark}, specifically the negation of Black and
Native people, is impossible to perceive with Moynihan's epistemic
frame. The [making of the white family through the genocide of the
Native and the enslavement of the Black over the centuries is bracketed
out of the "here"]{.mark} in the report.]{.underline} Within the same
"here," there is no trace of a Native family. That kind of family is an
impossibility[. These [centuries long social processes do not have
spatial coordinates that can be brought into]{.mark} the places and
locations of [the report]{.mark}. [They are]{.mark} flat and
conveniently [lacking in depth, space and]{.mark} measurable
[time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The "here" to which Moynihan
directs his gaze is an interesting discursive construction. Moynihan
encourages white America to look (perceive) here and know. [In my
reading I construe "[Here" as Moynihan's attempt to name, locate and
delimit the site of examination and scrutiny to the non relational and
isolated social unit of the family.]{.mark} Specifically, we are to
direct our attention to [the Negro family as an isolated, dysfunctional
and static consequence]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is here, at the location
of the family as where the true injury has occurred and damage has been
done. [The term damage indicates that we are now in the private realm of
pathology where [the individual and the family unit must be
addressed/fixed]{.mark}. Moynihan named the problems of the Negro family
"the tangle of pathology."By [imposing the measurable unit of the family
onto Black bodies, a pathologized Black private-public space is
constructed for examination.]{.mark} The [Black family]{.mark} as a unit

I am compelled by the way that Susana **[[Morris]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(2014) **[[persuades us to rethink our engagement
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the character **[[Precious and her
mother]{.mark} in]{.underline}** the novel **[Push]{.underline}**
(1996).42 Rather than avert our eyes, or look away shamed by images of
Black pathology depicted by a sadist of Mother (a Moynihanesque
Matriarch)---their family's story of poverty, incest, and
HIV---**[[Morris encourages readers to redirect]{.underline}]{.mark}**
our **[[attention to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the kinds of **[[community
of support and kinship]{.mark} that [Precious was forced to
create]{.mark} due to]{.underline}** her **[mother's, father's and
family's failure to love her.]{.underline}** Morris'
**[[rereading]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Push **[[enables a
reconsideration of]{.mark} the character [Precious as an agent]{.mark}
and [subject of change]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is **[able to work on
and heal herself through reworking]{.underline}** notions of **[kinship
and community.]{.underline}** Further, Precious crafts a Black
subjectivity partly through relinquishing her investments in and claims
to the 'Black family.' The author of Push, Sapphire creates a motherly
or maternal failure so totalizing that it precludes the possibility of
redeeming the Black matriarch or investing the Black family with any
moral authority. Because **[Precious cannot rely on her biological
parents to see]{.underline}** her **[and care for her]{.underline}**;
**[[she cannot turn to the family as an affirming
institution]{.underline}]{.mark}** or recourse **[in the face of a
rapine and cruel world.]{.underline}** Precious has no option but to
**[give up on the notion of the 'Black family' and
envision]{.underline}** and create **[something new]{.underline}** for
herself and her children. Throughout the novel as Precious comes into
literacy and engages various communities committed to healing, she is
also enacting a process of unnaming and renaming. Over the course of her
arc, **[[Precious]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[enacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** a series of **[[purgings]{.mark} and
divestments [from attachments to
heteronormativity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and homophobia). **[[Precious
rethinks]{.mark} her own [investments in Black nationalist]{.mark}
notions of [real 'manhood' and 'womanhood' which]{.mark}]{.underline}**
also **[[adhere themselves to fatherhood and

**[[seductions of romantic]{.mark} and filial
[love.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Having relinquished and unnamed these
models as stable, natural and always true, **[[Precious must insert
something else in]{.mark} their [place.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Toward
the end of the novel while having coffee in the city and in the company
of other women from her incest support group, Precious slowly sips her
hot chocolate and receives the revelation that, I'm alive inside. A bird
is my heart. Mama and Daddy is not win. I'm winning. I'm drinking hot
chocolate in the Village wif girls--- all kind who love me. How that is
so I don't know. **[How Mama and Daddy know me sixteen years
and]{.underline}** hate me, how **[a stranger meet me and love

is a part of **[this community of descendants of the

through jettisoning violent and exclusive humanistic categories of
intelligibility and coherence such as the heteronormative family,

and experiences of]{.underline}** a number of **[Black girls for whom
the promise of safety within]{.underline}** the confines of **[a
respectable and heteronormative family has failed to
materialize.]{.underline}** The courage to create something new through
unnaming something as true and universal in order to call forth another
mode of living and thriving is the story that Precious and other
survivors embody. **[Precious and the girls she makes kin]{.underline}**
with in the Village over hot chocolate **[represent
[their]{.mark}]{.underline}** own **[[community of fugitives]{.mark}
that [transform]{.mark}]{.underline}** themselves **[[from
strangers]{.underline}]{.mark}**---motherless incest survivors without
loving families---**[[to loved ones.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Precious and
her girls who meet each other as strangers and become something more
than that to one another, resemble Hartman's fugitives in flight who
cultivated relationships in another kind of symbolic economy. During
Saidiya **[[Hartman's]{.mark} journey to]{.underline}** into **[the
interior of Ghana]{.underline}** in search of the slave, Hartman
**[stops in the village of Gwolu]{.underline}**. Gwolu is a village
established by fugitives of the African slave trade. At some point
during her day-long visit in the village, **[she reflects upon the
way]{.underline}** that the **[villagers narrate their history of making

fabulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** enables her to create **[a
scene]{.underline}** for the reader of Lose Your Mother **[that [depicts
how fugitives]{.mark} might have attempted to weave relations on the
run.]{.underline}** All they shared was the rift and the danger that had
driven them. To remember what they had lost and what they became, what
had been torn apart and what had come together, the fugitives and the
refugees and multitudes in flight were called the Sisala, which means
"to come together, to become together, to weave together \[...\]
**[They]{.underline}** had **[[fled slave
raiders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[predatory
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[and exhausted land]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and]{.underline}**
they **[desired never to know any of it again]{.underline}** in this
sequestered niche of the savannah.\[...\]For all of this, they were
willing to begin anew. Knowing that you don't ever regain what you've
lost, they embraced becoming something other than who they had been and
naming themselves again. **[[Newcomers were
welcome.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[It did not matter]{.underline}** that
**[[they weren't kin]{.mark} or]{.underline}** that **[they spoke a
different language]{.underline}**, **[because genealogy did not
matter]{.underline}** (most of them could not go back more than three or
four generations, anyway), building community did. 'We' was the
collectivity they built from the ground up, not one they had inherited,
not one that others had imposed.45 Like Precious and the Sisala, the
**[Black fugitive evading capture must become something other than what
lineage, kin and genealogy beget.]{.underline}** To be willing to name
oneself again and again to avoid capture, discursive or otherwise, is
nothing short of an of fugitivity. Flight, becoming and renaming are the
"language" and ritual acts of the fugitive. Family as an everyday mode
of understanding and organizing the way that Black people envision human
social relations is not self-evident or transhistorical. After fifty
years of reflecting on the meaning of The Moynihan Report (1965) for the
'Black family,' **[[another look at the episteme of the 'family']{.mark}
is required]{.underline}**. While **[scholars]{.underline}** in Black
Studies, Sociology and Gender and Sexuality Studies ponder what is next
for the Black family in its multiple forms, they **[[might]{.mark} also
[ask what kind of violence]{.mark} the notion of [the 'family' can

the **[current categories that blunt efforts to re-craft what it means

#### Global settler colonialism and conquest instantiates Western supremacy via the sale of the nuclear family and heteropatriarchy to produce a universal social order -- the nuclear family is a colonial determinant of civility which reduces non-Europeans to a position of inhuman and conditions death-dealing on racial and gendered lines.

Moving from this close reading, [we]{.underline} will [turn
to]{.underline} secondary-source [analysis reflecting the attempted
foreclosure of]{.underline} the myriad of possibilities of [social
relations through the civilizing mission that instituted systemic
heteropatriarchy]{.underline}. The [universal rights of the law of
nations]{.underline}, and specifically the right to preach, [configured
the disciplining of natural law violations through the violent
heteropatriarchal ordering of]{.underline} compulsory dyadic
[heterosexuality, the gender binary, and]{.underline} the attempted
[eradication of]{.underline} all [other]{.underline} possible
socio-political-spiritual-relational [frameworks]{.underline}.
[Implicit]{.underline} in this framing [are]{.underline} the [embedded
dynamics of anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, anti-pagan, and
anti-Muslim]{.underline} [that cohere within the colonizing fervor
of]{.underline} Spain and other [Europe]{.underline}an countries, for
which a wider and deeper analysis than the scope of this article can
provide is necessary. There are many important implications for
Vitoria's construction of universal rights within emergent iterations of
modern systemic power relations. For the purposes of this article, I am
particularly focused on the construction of civility through the
imposition of heteropatriarchy to discipline all societies into the
universal standards of colonial-modernity. [The disciplining and
criminalization of gender nonnormativity]{.underline} [and sexual acts
between people not perceived]{.underline} as [in]{.underline} compliance
with [the]{.underline} dyadic male-female [gender binary]{.underline}
[is well documented throughout the colonial register]{.underline}.\[43\]
In 1519, Hernan Cortez sent a letter to Spanish King Charles V asking
for permission to punish Native peoples on the basis of claiming all
Native peoples as sodomites engaging in "abominable sin."\[44\] The
[Spanish historians]{.underline} [that published the]{.underline}
General History of the [Indies]{.underline} beginning in 1526 [detailed
many firsthand reports claiming homosexuality and gender transgressions
were common in Native societies,]{.underline} [which continued to fuel
justifications for conquest]{.underline} prior to Vitoria's legal
examination.\[45\] People who presented outside the gender binary were
often the first to be targeted for violence and death. Native Studies
Scholar Scott Morgenson argues that as the precursor to establishing
colonial rule, **[people who did not conform to the gender
binary]{.underline}** gender **[were explicitly targeted within
structures of colonial conquest]{.underline}**.\[46\] In "Extermination
of the Joyas," Native Studies Scholar Deborah Miranda demonstrates that
under early Spanish colonial-military rule, Native peoples who presented
outside the gender binary were specifically targeted for violent death
through attack by dogs.\[47\] **[Settler colonialism
functioned]{.underline}** through this dynamic [**to produce a
universally regulated social order that enforced** certain]{.underline}
types of [social relations]{.underline} [as primary and
natural]{.underline}---[namely]{.underline} that of [the male-female
gender binary]{.underline} [and]{.underline} of heterosexual relations
in accordance with [the]{.underline} structures of **[the nuclear
family]{.underline}**.\[48\] [These constructions]{.underline} of gender
and sexual identity formation [then operated to condition the power
relations of settler colonialism.]{.underline}\[49\] The formation of
colonial heteropatriarchy, which secured juridical order based on
natural law precepts, ordered settler colonial structures of governance
and laid the groundwork for establishing new legal systems. Morgenson
argues that **[Western law worked to uphold heteropatriarchy as a social
structure that was "universalized]{.underline}** whenever settler
societies come to be structured by a heteropatriarchal binary sex/gender
system."\[50\] **[This]{.underline}** phenomenon then **[became
normalized]{.underline}** not just to settlers or the Indigenous nations
they occupy, but also applied **[to the whole world]{.underline}**,
**[which attempted to force the totality of all societies to conform to
the Western universal.]{.underline}** [Heteropatriarchy worked to
undergird universal rights]{.underline} as the social and legal
constructs that cohered, as both objective and legal, [the violent
incoherence of settler colonial governance]{.underline}. **[In the
narrative of Western development]{.underline}**, gender is often framed
as a binary that all cultures have, and gender nonconformity is framed
as a new development arising in the West. Colonial Studies scholar Maria
Lugones emphasizes the importance of not naturalizing gender within
critiques of colonialism so as to **[see the imposition of the gender
binary]{.underline}** not just as normative but **[as tied to the
violent domination at work in differentiating notions of freedom through
colonialism]{.underline}**.\[51\] [Different understandings of
gender,]{.underline} sexuality, and socio-political relations [existed
across]{.underline} not only the New World and Europe but also across
[the whole globe]{.underline}. [Some social structures had an
understanding of three genders]{.underline}, more than three genders,
[and some did not determine relations on a gendered relation at
all]{.underline}.\[52\] African Gender Studies scholar Oyéronké Oyewùmí
argues that the construct of gender itself is a colonial imposition,
showing how in Yoruba society, **[gender was not an organizing principle
prior to Western colonization]{.underline}**.\[53\] Native Studies
scholar Qwo-Li Driskill argues that "[Two-Spirit" is a term that
signifies resistance to definitions of sexuality and gender of
colonialism]{.underline}, as reflective of other forms of relationality
outside of heteropatriarchy.\[54\] Native feminist work has articulated
the differing relations of Indigenous kinship as opposed to nuclear
families not dependent on heteropatriarchal formations of power
relations.\[55\] My intent here is not to position all Indigenous
societies as holding the same relationship to gender and sexuality, or
that those varied relations were not without their own complications.
Those are not my stories to tell. I am focused instead on [the
imposition of a singular, universal structure for social
relations]{.underline} that [position the gender binary and
heteropatriarchy as the standard form of relationality within
colonial-modernity.]{.underline} The [construction of the
universal]{.underline} in Vitoria's work is a false one---one that on
its face [is objective and all encompassing]{.underline}, [but
that]{.underline} in effect only operates to bring Indigenous societies
into the universal so as to be disciplined, justifiably killed,
enslaved, and fundamentally constructed as the "other" to the European
settler. Through this framework, [Indigenous]{.underline}
[societies]{.underline} writ large---across the globe---[are legally
differentiated from the European as inferior]{.underline}. **[This
positions non-Europeans, including enslaved Africans, as conscripted to
status of almost human and never achievable human, as]{.underline}**
already **[racialized]{.underline} [in distinction to the superior,
civil European]{.underline}**.\[56\] [This]{.underline} is not to elide
the differentiated treatment and experience of how the racializing
logics of anti-Blackness and Native erasure develop and function
differently within colonial-modernity, alongside other racialized
hierarchies.\[57\] Rather, positioning this relationality under
colonialism demonstrates the fundamental contradistinction of the
(white) European, who is, by virtue of the very construction of the
universal on the standards of European civility, implicitly entitled to
exercising universal rights. Through this reading, we can locate how
**[logics of racialization functioned to construct civility under
colonialism as European supremacy]{.underline}**, and its subsequent
outgrowth of white supremacy. From within the framework of
colonial-modernity then, [white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and
capitalism cohere as foundational systemic power relations]{.underline}
[that condition differentiated racialized and gendered
treatment]{.underline} and access within our present institutions. The
universal is constructed as a space only to be governed by
[Europeans]{.underline}, who [are positioned as superior based on
determinations of civility]{.underline}. [This lays the groundwork for
global Spanish colonialism as well the]{.underline} grounding [framework
for European colonial expansion]{.underline}. This dynamic is one that
from the advent of colonial-modernity will not be fundamentally
challenged by Western powers. The main contestations that develop in the
West concerning the legitimacy of colonialism will center competition
over which European entity will govern the newly-constructed universal,
not the more fundamental question of whether or not colonialism should
exist. [The grounding of Europeans as the civil, superior, and
legitimate governing entity]{.underline}, capable of exercising
universal rights, [is fundamentally determined through this foundational
legal codification of colonialism]{.underline}.

#### Imperial power relations produce the nuclear family in colonial settlements.

**Phillips 9** \[Richard Phillips, Department of Geography, University
of Liverpool, Liverpool, "Settler colonialism and the nuclear family,"
*The Canadian Geographer,* 6/1/2009\] sg

Debates about gender and sexuality have mushroomed in geography and
postcolonial criticism in recent years, but---particularly in
geography--- these debates have concentrated on the margins rather than
the centres of sexual life. Much of great value has been written about
sex workers (Hubbard 1999; after Walkowitz 1980) and same-sex desire
(Castells 1983; Bell and Valentine 1995), for instance, and much less
about those who occupy the moral and sexual centre ground, quietly
conforming to the often unwritten rules of the times and places in which
they find themselves. David Bell and Gill Valentine observed that '[A
big absence from geographies of sexualities is, ironically, the dominant
sexuality within contemporary sexualities---
heterosexuality']{.underline} (Bell and Valentine 1995, p. 12). [This
echoed]{.underline} Julia [Cream's]{.underline} [call]{.underline} for
researchers interested in sexuality and space [to interrogate the often
hidden sexualization of everyday spaces:]{.underline} We need to know
how space is produced as uncontaminated, and shorn of its associations
with sexuality. Sexuality is so often hidden away in the upstairs of
homes, behind closed doors, or in the upper reaches of the disciplinary
house. [We need to expose the ways in which it has been excluded,
obscured and rendered irrelevant.]{.underline} (Cream 1994, p. 122)
[This means interrogating ordinary sexualities, including those rendered
almost invisible by their constructed normality]{.underline} (Phillips
2006b). To see why **[it is important to denaturalize the nuclear
family]{.underline}**---[as a social institution that hinges on a sexual
contract]{.underline}---it is first necessary to understand [Foucault's
analysis]{.underline} of sexuality as 'an especially dense transfer
point for relations of power' (Foucault 1978, p. 103). Ann Laura Stoler,
in a postcolonial critique of Foucault's History of Sexuality and an
archival study of colonial sexual life, [has shown how sexuality was a
dense transfer point for relations of specifically imperial
power]{.underline} (Stoler 1996, 2002). Stoler argues that **[sexual and
other forms of intimacy both reflected and produced colonial social
relations]{.underline}**; her analysis draws upon the memories of
[domestic servants in the Dutch East Indies,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} speaks to those of others affected by colonialism,
such as the former [pupils of residential schools in Canada]{.underline}
(De Leeuw 2007). **[Sexualized imperial power was expressed and produced
in relationships between individuals]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline}
in turn [were shaped by]{.underline} what Lenore Manderson calls [the
'moral logic of colonialism']{.underline} (Manderson 1997, p. 373). As
Sally Engle Merry has shown in her work on Hawai'i, this logic was
complex, contested and differentiated. She contrasts the priorities of
overlapping groups of Christians and capitalists, finding the former
interested in the eating habits, cleanliness, sleep and sexuality of
colonial subjects, the latter with their punctuality and discipline
(Merry 2000, p. 16). The often heated arenas of imperial sexuality
politics suggest that, though academic research on the subject is
relatively new, sensitivity to the issues at stake is not. [It was
widely recognized on the imperial shopfloor and in the imperial
home]{.underline}---tacitly or explicitly, by family members, medical
workers, schoolteachers, owners and employees of plantations or mines,
governments--- [that sex was important]{.underline} not only for the
pleasure (for some) but also [for]{.underline} the
[business]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the fundamental social bonds
and everyday routines of [empire]{.underline}. The importance of the
colonial family is supported in the historical record. There is much
evidence that **[nuclear families were an important presence in many
resettlement societies]{.underline}** and that this was due both to the
relocation of families and to the fact that many men and women travelled
with ideas and expectations about families they would like to form.
[**Social and specifically legal frameworks** were also
relocated]{.underline}, [and this **allowed nuclear families to flourish
in colonial societies**]{.underline}. Legal historian Patrick Brode
shows that a series of laws underpinned the institution of marriage in
early Canada by legislating against breaches of marital conduct (such as
sex outside marriage and failure to keep a promise to marry). These were
both 'a major feature of early Canadian jurisprudence' and 'part of the
inherited English system' (Valverde 1991; Brode 2002, p. vii).
Crucially, he adds that English laws were imported selectively. For
instance, [laws that propped up nuclear families were
adopted]{.underline}, whereas those providing poor relief were not.
Colonial law and the production of the nuclear family [To understand the
difference between the transplantation of nuclear families to colonial
societies]{.underline}, and their production in such societies, [it
helps to review]{.underline} a criticism that has been applied to one of
the more influential (and polemical) interventions in the debate about
[imperialism and sexuality]{.underline}. Ronald Hyam's colourfully
illustrated thesis in Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience is
that their active sex lives helped British men through months and years
in penal colonies and resource frontiers, military camps and farming
settlements, and attracted some of them there in the first place. 'The
expansion of Europe', he argued, 'was not only a matter of Christianity
and commerce, it was also a matter of copulation and concubinage' (Hyam
1990, p. 2). The idea that British men travelled with fully formed if
sometimes repressed sexualities, which were then simply liberated
through the 'essentially harmless pleasures' of empire (Hyam 1990, p.
152), does not survive Foucault's powerful critique of the 'repressive
hypothesis' (the 'repressive hypothesis' regards sexualities as innate,
and as such either repressed or liberated in social contexts; Foucault
argued, on the contrary, that sexualities are socially produced).
Recasting sexualities as contextually and discursively produced, through
reciprocal relationships with powerful social institutions such as
medical, religious and legal establishments, Foucault (1978) showed that
[sexual desires were not so much fulfilled as produced in colonial
contexts and encounters]{.underline} (Stoler 1996). Hyam's (1990)
account in Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience of British men,
travelling overseas with fully formed sexualities, is also disrupted by
the more general postcolonial critique of what James Blaut has called
'the colonizer's model of the world': the Eurocentric assumption that
colonial societies and their components---arguably including nuclear
families---were fundamentally derivative. Blaut contests what he calls
'Eurocentric diffusionism': the assumption that 'culture', 'innovation'
and 'human causality' flow from the European to the non-European world
(Blaut 1993, p. 1). Contesting the worldview that casts Europe as the
eternal inside and asserts that 'Inside innovates, Outside imitates',
Blaut (1993, p. 1) articulates some familiar axioms of postcolonial
criticism---most generally, the critique of colonial binaries---in
specifically geographical terms. Theoretically, these points have been
well taken. The challenge is to translate them into more specific and
concrete terms. One way of doing this is to develop and substantiate
claims that [nuclear families were not simply taken to British colonies
but were to some extent made in them]{.underline}, and that these and
other forms of sexualized social life not only reflected but actively
defined the colonial order. **[The nuclear family was transplanted and
produced in settlement societies]{.underline}**, not only by the
individuals who formed families, but **[by the social and cultural
processes]{.underline}**--- [including]{.underline} the [legal
mechanisms and institutional]{.underline} contexts and
[frameworks]{.underline}---[that encouraged them to do so]{.underline}.
This section acknowledges some of the legal processes, and specifically
the laws governing family life and defining the parameters of family
that underpinned the production of colonial families (Blomley 1994;
Cooper 1998; Blomley et al. 2001). [**This**]{.underline} discussion
**[ranges beyond formal legal systems because]{.underline}**, as
Foucault argued and others have amplified, **[sexuality is regulated and
constructed through a wide variety of institutions]{.underline}**
([including]{.underline} the [religious and medical
establishments]{.underline}) **[and practices]{.underline}**
([including]{.underline} the [regulation]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
other family members and of [the self)]{.underline} (Foucault 1978; Hunt
1999). In the interests of focus, emphasis is placed upon laws that
shaped families in a primary sense rather than those that governed
families and discriminated against individuals on the basis of their
membership of such families. Examples of the latter include the
Homestead Act (1862) and Canadian and other colonial equivalents and
derivatives, which generally allocated land to families and single men:
in the United States and Canada, married couples could claim 160 acres,
unmarried men half that much and unmarried women and children nothing at
all. Profoundly and foundationally important though they were, laws such
as these were ultimately secondary because they worked with ideas of
marriage and family that had already been defined through primary
legislation.

INCARCERATION IS THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE SOCIAL INDIVIDUAL THROUGH WAR
If one were to insist, **[the opposite of professionalization is that
fugitive impulse to rely on the undercommons for
protection]{.underline}**, to rely on the **[honor]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** to insist on **[the honor of the
fugitive]{.underline}** **[community]{.underline}**; if one were to
insist, **[the opposite of professionalization is that criminal impulse
to steal from professions]{.underline}**, **[from the
university]{.underline}**, with neither apologies nor malice, to steal
the enlightenment for others, to steal oneself with a certain blue
music, a certain tragic optimism, to steal away with mass
intellectuality; if one were to do this, would this not be to place
criminality and negligence against each other? Would it not place
professionalization, would it not place the university, against honor?
And what then could be said for criminality? **[Perhaps then it needs to
be said that the crack dealer, terrorist, and political prisoner share a
commitment to war]{.underline}**, and **[society responds in kind with
wars on crime, terror, drugs, communism]{.underline}**. But "this war on
the commitment to war" crusades as a war against the asocial, that is,
those who live "without a concern for sociality." Yet it cannot be such
a thing. After all, **[it is professionalization itself that is devoted
to the asocial]{.underline}**, **[the university itself that
reproduces]{.underline}** the **[knowledge of how to neglect
sociality]{.underline}** in its very concern **[for what it calls
asociality]{.underline}**. No, this war against the commitment to war
responds to this commitment to war as the threat that it is -- not mere
negligence or careless destruction but a commitment against the idea of
society itself, that is, against what Foucault called the conquest, the
unspoken war that founded, and with the force of law, refounds society.
Not asocial but against the social, this is the commitment to war, and
this is what disturbs and at the same time forms the undercommons
against the university. Is this not the way to understand incarceration
in the United States today? And understanding it, **[can we not say that
it is precisely the fear]{.underline}** that the **[criminal will rise
to challenge the negligence that leads to the need]{.underline}**, **[in
the]{.underline}** context of the **[American state and]{.underline}**
its particularly violent **[Universitas]{.underline}** circle, to
concentrate always on conquest denial. THE UNIVERSITY IS THE SITE OF THE
SOCIAL REPRODUCTION OF CONQUEST DENIAL **[Here one comes face to face
with]{.underline}** the roots of professional and critical commitment to
negligence, to the depths of the impulse to deny the thought of the
internal outside among critical intellectuals, and **[the necessity for
professionals to question without question]{.underline}**. Whatever else
they do, **[critical intellectuals who have found space in the
university are]{.underline}** always **[already performing the denial of
the new society when they deny the undercommons]{.underline}**, when
they find that space on the surface of the university, and **[when they
join the conquest denial by improving that space]{.underline}**. Before
they criticise the aesthetic and the Aesthetic, the state and the State,
history and History, they have already practiced the operation of
denying what makes these categories possible in the underlabor of their
social being as critical academics. **[The slogan on the
Left]{.underline}**, then, "**[universities, not jails]{.underline}**,"
**[marks a choice that may not be possible]{.underline}**. In other
words, perhaps more universities promote more jails. **[Perhaps it is
necessary finally to see that the university produces incarceration
as]{.underline}** the **[product of its negligence]{.underline}**.
Perhaps **[there is another relation between the University and the
Prison]{.underline}** -- **[beyond]{.underline}** simple opposition or
**[family resemblance]{.underline}** -- that the undercommons reserves
as the object and inhabitation of another abolitionism. What might
appear as **[the professionalization of the American
university]{.underline}**, our starting point, **[now might better be
understood as a certain intensifcation of method in the
Universitas]{.underline}**, a tightening of the circle.
Professionalization cannot take over the American university -- it is
the critical approach of the university, its Universitas. And indeed, it
appears now that this state with its peculiar violent hegemony must deny
what Foucault called in his 1975-76 lectures the race war. War on the
commitment to war breaks open the memory of the conquest. The new
American studies should do this, too, if it is to be not just a people's
history of the same country but a movement against the possibility of a
country, or any other; not just property justly distributed on the
border but property unknown. And there are other spaces situated between
the Universitas and the undercommons, spaces that are characterized
precisely by not having space. Thus the fire aimed at black studies by
everyone from William Bennett to Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the
proliferation of Centers without affiliation to the memory of the
conquest, to its living guardianship, to the protection of its honor, to
the nights of labor, in the undercommons. The university, then, is not
the opposite of the prison, since they are both involved in their way
with the reduction and command of the social individual. And indeed,
under the circumstances, **[more universities and fewer prisons
would]{.underline}**, it has to be concluded, **[mean the memory of the
war was being further lost]{.underline}**, **[and living
unconquered]{.underline}**, **[conquered labor abandoned to its lowdown
fate]{.underline}**. Instead, **[the undercommons takes the prison as a
secret about the conquest]{.underline}**, but a secret, **[as Sara Ahmed
says]{.underline}**, **[whose growing secrecy is its
power]{.underline}**, its ability to keep a distance between it and its
revelation, a secret that calls into being the prophetic, a secret held
in common, organized as secret, calling into being the prophetic
organization. THE UNDERCOMMONS OF THE UNIVERSITY IS A NONPLACE OF
ABOLITION Ruth Wilson Gilmore: "Racism is the state-sanctioned and/or
extralegal production and exploitation of group diferentiated
vulnerabilities to premature (social, civil and/or corporeal) death."
What is the difference between this and slavery? What is, so to speak,
the object of abolition? Not so much the abolition of prisons but the
abolition of a society that could have prisons, that could have slavery,
that could have the wage, and therefore not abolition as the elimination
of anything but abolition as the founding of a new society. The object
of abolition then would have a resemblance to communism that would be,
to return to Spivak, uncanny. **[The uncanny that disturbs the critical
going on above it]{.underline}**, **[the professional going on without
it]{.underline}**, **[the uncanny that one can sense in
prophecy]{.underline}**, the strangely known moment, the gathering
content, of a cadence, and the uncanny that one can sense in
cooperation, **[the secret once called solidarity.]{.underline}** **[The
uncanny feeling we are left with is]{.underline}** that something else
is there in **[the undercommons]{.underline}**. **[It is the prophetic
organization that works for the red and black abolition!]{.underline}**

The **[principle of equity establishes itself in this place
where]{.underline}** there is, notably, the **[presence of vulnerable
groups]{.underline}** and where vulnerability **[is inscribed from the
place of difference]{.underline}**. The starting point for thinking
about equity, apart from the comprehension of being a principle of
social justice, is to point out that in the field of health inequities
are not limited to the different social positions of people in an
economic hierarchy, reaching determinations of gender, sexuality and
different ethnic groups. **[Gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity
compose]{.underline}** the set of the **[so-called
minorities]{.underline}**, **[that have]{.underline}** in common **[not
the fact of expressing a smaller population contingent]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}**, rather, **[represent values that have been
constructed throughout history]{.underline}**, as **[antagonistic to
values expressed as superiors and desirable.]{.underline}** Like that,
the **[hegemonic construction of the masculine is made in opposition
to]{.underline}** the **[inferior constitution of the
feminine]{.underline}**, the one of the **[white in opposition
to]{.underline}** the one of **[the black]{.underline}**, and the one of
the **[heterosexual in opposition to the]{.underline}** one of the
**[homosexual]{.underline}**. Here, a series of questions that point to
answers that are not easy to find begins to unfold. Here, one can, also,
think of some paradoxes that are, today, in the scenario of the health
processes and in health training itself. One might ask, for example, how
does health, in its dynamic of changing in health practices, consider
minorities as subordinate actors and, therefore, outside the social
order? How do education processes in the scope of health interfere in
the processes of subjectivation, revealing a new individual? On the
other hand, it can be configured as a paradox the fact that **[recent
statements]{.underline}**, inscribed in health policies, **[appeal to
the constitution of a new autonomous individual]{.underline}**, whose
subjectivity is considered in the act of the health production, while
**[the low capacity of these policies is capable of interfering
in]{.underline}** the **[daily lives of the actors that
connect]{.underline}** to each other **[in]{.underline}** the **[social
micro spaces]{.underline}**. These issues, that, **[by
themselves]{.underline}**, are already complex, **[become challenging in
contexts of democratic crisis]{.underline}**, where the places of
interlocution between the State with the civil society become more
nebulous, while at the same time they are precisely the groups less
permeable to the agenda of certain social groups (in particular,
Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals - LGBT, gypsies or
quilombolas) who are considered to be the formulators and implementers
of public policies. The ascension of conservative and neoconservative
groups, in a context of political crisis and fragility of the State,
obscures the possibilities of interlocution. In **[this
essay]{.underline}**, it **[is aimed to understand the possibilities
of]{.underline}** an **[equity]{.underline}** policy for the LGBT
population, **[in the light of a crisis context]{.underline}**, with the
purpose of taking the inputs of the Queer Theory to reveal the
possibilities of a public policy of intervention about the dynamics of
cultural inequalities, when related to the different forms of affection
and homosexual practices. For contexts of crisis, it is proposed that
questions relative to gender and sexuality can be aimed from the
perspective of queer theorists. **[This perspective
adopts]{.underline}** as **[a field of analysis the processes of
normalization of social life]{.underline}**,
**[especially]{.underline}**, **[heteronormativity]{.underline}**,
**[and considers that it is within]{.underline}** the **[scope of
networks of power and resistance that]{.underline}** the
**[possibilities of rupture and transgression of]{.underline}** the
**[heteronormative processes are installed]{.underline}**. Speaking of
difference, inscribing a queer possibility In a first stage, the
reflections around the idea of difference, when reflected from the
brazilian context, refer to the notion of multiculturalism as a
presupposition to think of equity policies. To speak of, however,
multiculturalism is to make explicit an arena of conflicts such as the
words of Gonçalves e Silva indicate: **[To speak of multiculturalism is
to speak of the game of differences]{.underline}**, **[whose rules are
defined in social struggles by actors who]{.underline}**, for one reason
or another, **[experience the bitter taste of discrimination and
prejudice within]{.underline}** the **[societies]{.underline}** in which
they live. (GONÇALVES; SILVA, 2006, P. 9). This game, **[this
construction of identities and differences]{.underline}**, the
possibility of **[considering the other in its different
condition]{.underline}**, **[assuming difference as a value of
positivity]{.underline}** in the spaces of production and reproduction
of knowledge, have to do with the understanding of historical processes
and contexts that have propitiated its construction. One more time, the
mentioned authors remind us that: \[\...\] **[it is]{.underline}** very
difficult, if not **[impossible]{.underline}**, **[to comprehend the
rules of this game without explaining]{.underline}** the
**[socio-historical contexts in which]{.underline}** the **[individuals
act]{.underline}**, in order **[to interfere in]{.underline}** the
**[politics of meanings around which they give intelligibility to their
own experiences]{.underline}**, building themselves as actors.
(GONÇALVES; SILVA, 2006, P. 9). From the idea of diversity and tolerance
to the understanding of language as a system that constructs the other,
the difference is inscribed from the social and historical construction
of the notions of normal, deviation and identity. Thinking about
identity is always thinking about what it is, but what it is only makes
sense when it refers to what it is not. Therefore, identity always
refers to the construction of difference. In this sense, Woodward states
that the **[identity to exist depends on something outside of
it]{.underline}**; that is, of another identity, of an identity that it
is not that it differs from identity, but that, however, provides the
conditions for it to exist. **[Identity is]{.underline}** thus **[marked
by difference]{.underline}** \"\[\...\] **[difference is sustained by
exclusion]{.underline}**\" (WOODWARD, 2010, P. 9-10). Therefore, we can
understand that **[cultural identities are produced in]{.underline}**
the **[social practices]{.underline}**, **[through]{.underline}** a
process of **[production of difference]{.underline}**. The dynamics of
the formation of identity refers to the existence of \'another one\',
what makes identity and otherness inseparable components. Woodward
(2010, P. 11) points out that Identity is marked by difference, but it
seems that some differences \[\...\] are seen as more important than
others, especially in particular places and at particular moments.
**[Treating]{.underline}** the **[different sexualities that escape
from]{.underline}** the **[heterosexual norm as
inferiors]{.underline}**, from some supposed natural or biological
characteristic, **[is not simply an error]{.underline}**, **[but the
demonstration of]{.underline}** the **[imposition of]{.underline}** an
\"**[eloquent cultural grade]{.underline}** upon a nature which, in
itself, is - culturally speaking - silent\" (SILVA, 2011, P. 145). The
biological interpretations are, before being biological,
interpretations, that is, they are no more than the imposition of a
matrix of signification. The marking of difference, which, according to
Foucault (2010), is historically determined through different discursive
productions, will depend on numerous processes of exclusion, border
surveillance, strategies of division that, in the last resort, define
hierarchies, evaluation scales, systems of categorization. (FURLANI,
2007, P. 273). For Hall (2011), an identity has to do not so much with
the issues \'who we are\' or \'where we came from\', but much more with
the questions \'how we can become\' and \'how we have been
represented\'. **[The question that becomes central]{.underline}**,
then, **[is how this representation about ourselves affects our way of
life.]{.underline}** **[Identity and difference cannot be
comprehended]{.underline}**, therefore, **[apart from the systems of
signification in which they acquire meaning.]{.underline}** **[As Silva
affirms]{.underline}** (2011, P. 75), \"**[they are not beings of
nature, but of the culture and symbolic systems that compose
it]{.underline}**\". Saying it does not mean, however, saying that they
are determined, once and for all, by the discursive and symbolic systems
that give them definition. It turns out that language, understood here
more generally as systems of signification is, itself, an unstable
structure. This is exactly what the so-called post-structuralist
theorists, like Derrida, have indicated in their texts. In this sense is
that Derrida will speak of philosophies of the difference. In the
comprehension of Heuser (2005), from a synthesis of the thought of
Derrida: To the philosophies of difference are not about overcoming or
surpassing the metaphysical tradition, since it is impossible to get rid
of it, finally. It is a matter of questioning it; of calling into
question their senses and no senses, their intrinsic paradoxes, their
oppressions; of understanding metaphysics as a great text that is open
to new interpretations. (HEUSER, 2005, P. 73). The reading of Derrida
leads us to understand **[the role of language in the conformation of
difference and]{.underline}** its **[allocation in positions of
subordination and marginality]{.underline}**, but it also makes explicit
the **[human life as an open text]{.underline}**, where it is not
possible to universalize the singular forms of living of the different
groups, in particular, groups that, at different moments and contexts of
history, **[have been defined as aberrations, deviant and
different.]{.underline}** In sum, the constitution of **[difference from
the delimitation of identity creates a permanent zone of tension and
instability]{.underline}**. This **[tension comes from the networks of
power that circulate in the poles of identity and
difference]{.underline}**. **[This can activate practices of
resistance]{.underline}**, which can be thought of as discursive and
non-discursive practices against states of domination and effects of
power.

## 2AC A2 FW -- THE RULES

#### Complicity with quare rhizomes of refusal precedes debate's predetermined protocols -- to refuse the heteronormative temporality of whiteness and look inward and outward into alternative spatio-temporal social registers.

**Johnson 16**. E. Patrick Johnson is the Carlos Montezuma Professor of
Performance Studies and Professor of African-American Studies at
Northwestern University \[\"No Tea, No Shade,\" 2016, New Writings in
Black Queer Studies\]//vikas

Far from a rose garden, this meditation, toward a critical pedagogical
agenda, assays a renarrativization of and **[for Black
studies]{.underline}**---**[finding rhizomes rather than
"roots."]{.underline}** And, indeed, as always,
**[routes]{.underline}**---**[in and out of families]{.underline}**,
discourses, and movements.3 **[Finding nourishment]{.underline}**, **[as
water lilies do]{.underline}**, **[in deep dark muck]{.underline}**.
**[Persistent like bamboo and other creeping grasses]{.underline}**.
Rare and delicate like orchids. Here **[I want to propose a Black/queer
rhizomatic agencement]{.underline}**---**[including literatures,
politics, and methodologies]{.underline}**---a**[s well as demonstrate a
Black/queer rhizomatic way of seeing and saying]{.underline}**.4 In
nature, **[rhizomes arise from underground]{.underline}** or underwater
**[connections]{.underline}**/roots/routes **[that are neither limited
to one place nor destined to go in only one direction.]{.underline}**
The rhizomatic thus represents a queer temporality and sociality that is
processual---not teleological or "narrativized in advance."5 A
rhizomatic conceptualization of relations, space, and time. This
**[temporality is one of time collapsed or at least
reconfigured]{.underline}**---**[not "straight time,"]{.underline}** in
which, for example, **[what is putatively most important happens in the
daytime]{.underline}**, or **[in which one "grows out of " same-sex
"play" or finally "settles down" into heteronormative or homonormative
sociality]{.underline}**. In this time, **[one can project imaginations
into the future and cut into the past]{.underline}**---all in the
pursuit of an elaborated litany for thriving. In this space, **[desires
and socialities claim family and children not merely from biological or
legal]{.underline}** means **[but]{.underline}** also by a process of
**[nurture and nourishment]{.underline}**. In some respects, **[Audre
Lorde has already given us]{.underline}** this **[utopic vision of work,
love, and struggle]{.underline}**:

*looking inward and outward*

*at once before and after*

*seeking a now that can breed*

*futures*

*like bread in our children's mouths*

*so their dreams will not reflect*

*the death of ours*

Here I take inspiration not only from Hughes and Lorde but also from
French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's notion of the
rhizome---including and beyond tradition and history: creative,
promiscuous, underground or underwater, multiple, and sometimes
contradictory---to propose Black/queer rhizomatics. **[The
rhizome]{.underline}** (from the Greek for "mass of roots") **[is the
mode of propagation and sustenance for plants as diverse as the lotus,
bamboo, bunch grasses, ginger, irises, and orchids.]{.underline}**
Digging up a clump of bamboo from its so-called roots will not mean that
the bamboo will not grow at that site. Deracinated never. The lotus
flower seems to appear out of nowhere "without roots" but gains
nutrients and information buried deeply in its dark, watery grove. In A
Thousand Plateaus, **[Deleuze and Guattari encourage us
to]{.underline}** "**[form rhizomes and not roots]{.underline}**,
**[never plant!]{.underline}** **[Don't sow]{.underline}**,
**[forage]{.underline}**! Be neither a One nor a Many, but
multiplicities! Form a line, never a point! . . . and let your loves be
like the wasp and the orchid. As they sing of old man river:

*He don't plant taters*

*Don't plant cotton*

*Them that plants them is soon*

*forgotten*

*But old man river he just keeps rollin'*

*along."*

**[If that ain't "quare," I don't know what is!]{.underline}**8 With
varying intensities, **[Black diaspora scholars have already followed
the seductive pull]{.underline}** of Deleuze and Guattari's nomadic
rhizomatic model of analysis---notably, **[including]{.underline}** Paul
**[Gilroy and]{.underline}** Édouard **[Glissant]{.underline}**. They
were each, of course, **[searching for new ways to engage age-old
experiences of forced, coerced, and free movement]{.underline}**;
connection; and difficult, materially consequential origin stories (if
not "origins") in the context of modernity. Glissant held that
"rhizomatic thought is the principle behind . . . poetics of relations,
in which each and every identity is extended through a relationship with
the other." As J. Lorand Matory reminds us, Gilroy too flirted with the
notion of the rhizome/rhizomatic in Black Atlantic, but does not pursue
this in his search for ways to read intermixture, exchange, hybridity,
and doubleness through chronotypes---famously settling on the figure of
the ship.9 While I am not aware of the particular language of rhizomes
previously being taken up in Black/queer or Black feminist work, the
spirit of this is clearly at work in the ways scholars and artists have
engaged the question of "roots" and routes---not necessarily apropos of
moving place but of reckoning ancestry (in terms of claiming and
recalling early same-genderloving artists and writers) and shifting,
combining, and rethinking aesthetic, intellectual, and political
traditions. You may consider this both on everyday and more rarified
levels. **[Think]{.underline}**, for example, about Cathy **[Cohen's
skillful and timely reversal of strategic early twentieth-century
DuBoisian and Lockean politics of representation and
respectability]{.underline}**, **[to focus]{.underline}** precisely
**[on]{.underline}** "**[punks, bulldaggers, and welfare
queens]{.underline}**" **[toward]{.underline}** finally **[achieving the
ends for which a preceding generation of Black scholars]{.underline}**
had also fought. **[The Black/queer rhizome is
generative]{.underline}**, as **[it inspires connection beyond a staid,
linear genealogy]{.underline}**; **[it rejects]{.underline}** old
**[teleologies of heteronormative natural "progress" from a single
root]{.underline}** or (family) tree. Feel here the ineluctable
association and relatedness with "intersectionality." The ways in which
African (descended) groups (dis)identify as Black (or "black"),
Afro-hyphenated, Kréyol, Creole, mixed, or other ways of naming or
signifying (Black) hybridity do not occur in a vacuum. These choices are
conditioned by particularities of place, as well as other relations that
include and simultaneously surpass the local. This of course includes
Black lgbtq/sgl hybridity which is variously and oftentimes
controversially named today vis-à-vis this clumsy acronym to which we
necessarily continue to add letters. I have already suggested that in
what many of us now call Black queer studies, as "outside children" of
Black studies and queer studies, we claim new ways to queerly trace our
emergences beyond patronymic reconstruction, to do a new
dance---precipitating a shift, structuring a conjuncture. In tracing
intellectual, artistic, and activist rhizomatic formations, we are
compelled to envision and produce work that is deeply humane and
capacious. Our analyses reflect not only "real life" on the ground but
also speculate on liberatory models from the past, and project our
imaginations forward, to possible futures. This call is not to imagine
one single rhizome---of, let's say, bamboo---creeping all over the
world, but rather a historically derived sociocultural system with
political-economic structures in its "dna." For our purposes in this
meditation, the Black/queer rhizomatic agencement is most profitably
thought of as a habit of mind---a way of seeing and saying as much as a
mode of thinking or doing. **[The rhizomatic is beyond tradition and
memory]{.underline}**: **[creative, promiscuous, multiple, and often
contradictory]{.underline}**. Like this essay. The **[generative value
of difference, performativity, and play in the
rhizomatic]{.underline}**, and its **[grounding in a commitment to
address material circumstances and]{.underline}** the **[metaphysical at
once]{.underline}**, **[parallel Black/queer poetic
traditions]{.underline}**. Like Black/queer, the rhizome, Deleuze and
Guattari offer, "doesn't begin and doesn't end, but is always in the
middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo."10 Today, this is where
Black/queer studies finds itself---in medias res. That is, entering into
conversations already begun---not with the intention to falsify, but
rather to more fundamentally reorder, critically retell stories long
told and overlooked, and compose new stories out of our word-rich
grammars. Thus, the analysis offered here emerges from close readings of
important nodes of the present moment and the recent past, to theorize a
"new disagreements around language of "same-gender loving," "lgbt,"
"queer," and "dl" in the United States, and various local names and
concepts used to (self )identify gender nonnormative, "sexual minority,"
or otherwise nonheteronormative individuals of Africa(n descent), in
various parts of the world. **[Looking beyond "survival" that was never
meant for us]{.underline}**, **[toward societal transformation and
thriving]{.underline}**, **[will require shifting the narratives we have
rehearsed]{.underline}**, **[toward a future in which we are indeed
"fluent in each other's histories"]{.underline}** and conversant in each
other's imaginations.12 Scholars have already assayed jeremiads,
corrections, and agendas that were warranted by the moments in which
they were offered, and some of which are essential to return to consider
at this important social-cultural conjuncture. **[While elements of each
find expression here]{.underline}**, **[this is]{.underline}** not
(only) a critique or a genealogy or a lament, but rather **[a meditation
taking a hybrid form]{.underline}** in an attempt **[to]{.underline}**
"**[say some things I think ought to be said]{.underline}**" about Black
(and) queer intellectual traditions and pedagogies.13 After all, this is
an important moment to critically reassess (and celebrate) the project
we have come to know as Black queer studies. Today, the economic outlook
is foggy; the political landscape is stony, contradictory, and riddled
with fissures. There are reminders every day---from the banal to the
spectacular---of the denial of Black beauty, Black dignity, and Black
life. Further, the academic and intellectual foundations on which Black
studies was built seem to shift beneath our feet (still). **[This is a
conjunctural moment]{.underline}**, **[full of complex challenges and
opportunities]{.underline}**---a few which are new (or newly
configured), and others that remind us, plus ça change, plus c'est la
même chose.

**[If only there had been a proper revolution in this country,
where]{.underline}** the **[aristos and landowners had been dispatched
and dispossessed]{.underline}** once and for all. **[Despite the best
efforts of our utopian political ancestors, we are stuck
with]{.underline}** exactly **[same bastards who made everyone's lives a
misery]{.underline}** hundreds of years ago. **[They]{.underline}** have
the same names, own even more of the land, go to the same schools and
universities and believe they have a God-given right to govern,
**[pilfer and demonise everyone else. Their traditions are as nauseating
as they are cruel]{.underline}**: bloodsports, class war, incarcerating
the poor, not to mention polo, finishing schools, up-turned collars and
smashing up restaurants for fun. **[One thing the ruling class loves
above all else is 'debate'. Although]{.underline}** the **[rule of law
came about as a consequence of]{.underline}** the **[bourgeoisie getting
sick of being thrown in jail by whimsical aristos]{.underline}**,
today's **[elites]{.underline}**, all of them, **[know]{.underline}**
that the **[law is]{.underline}** always **[on their
side]{.underline}**, regardless of whether they are really old school
feudal elites or only posh since the last 300 years. Debate is class
war, as determined by them. **['Debate']{.underline}** is what future
arms dealers are taught to engage in, how future prime ministers are
taught to **[eradicate]{.underline}** all **[residual human
feeling,]{.underline}** how **[judges are able to sleep at night and how
the]{.underline}** powerful **[are able to pretend that the normal
running of things is in any way 'fair'.]{.underline}** When the 2011
Eton entrance exam asks 13- year-old boys to hypothesise being Prime
Minister and to defend the shooting dead of protesters, we catch a
glimpse of this taught moral flexibility: The year is 2040. There have
been riots in the streets of London after Britain has run out of petrol
because of an oil crisis in the Middle East. Protesters have attacked
public buildings. Several policemen have died. Consequently, the
Government has deployed the Army to curb the protests. After two days
the protests have stopped but 25 protesters have been killed by the
Army. You are the Prime Minister. Write the script for a speech to be
broadcast to the nation in which you explain why employing the Army
against violent protesters was the only option available to you and one
which was both necessary and moral. But unfortunately for everyone else,
this kind **[of imaginative exercise doesn't remain hypothetical for
very long]{.underline}**. These **[people move from volatile scenario on
page to violent action in real life without]{.underline}** ever
**[encountering people who might have reason to protest, protected as
they are by gated communities, boarding schools, poorly-treated nannies,
private education, money to burn, member's clubs and]{.underline}**,
above all, **[money, assets and private property. Being trained to argue
anything so long as it preserves the existing order is the definition of
law as practiced by the state. The moral flexibility that]{.underline}**
private schools and **[debating societies teach is the rhetorical
lubricant that ensures that the ruling class will always
win.]{.underline}** No one else will ever win 'the debate' **[because
the entire purpose of debate is to prevent anything truly disruptive
from happening, all the while masking real violence]{.underline}** from
being seen. While Britain brutally colonised half the globe, its posh

## Method Extension -- Worldism

#### Worldism intervenes into the propertied formations of classical liberal thought that instrumentalize Others as instruments for colonization, domination, exploitation, and humiliation. Worldism proposes an alternative social ontology elsewhere that attempts to think the House of IR in relation to other traditioins and legacies that the House of IR attempts to erase and make irrelevant.

CONCLUSION: The Other in Alterity The foundational legacies of Hobbes
and Locke work in tandem to secure the Neoliberal world order. [Fear
without property, as institutionalized by law, would manifest in Locke's
warning about unfettered state power]{.underline} ("where law ends,
tyranny begins"). Property without fear, in the form of moral or legal
constraints, would realize Hobbes' nightmare scenario of wanton desire
satiated at will and in anarchy ("warre of all against all"). Indeed,
[Hobbesian fear requires Lockean private property for the Leviathan to
take effect]{.underline} (otherwise, why not stay with the absolute
freedom offered by the State of Nature?), [just as the Lockean right to
property is premised on Hobbesian fear to keep the State of Nature at
bay]{.underline} (otherwise, why suffer a Leviathan?). **[Neoliberalism
updates this classical social ontology to have the Leviathan/world order
safeguard property globally -- redefined as land, labor, and market
shares -- precisely due to fear of the wanton masses
locally.]{.underline}** The Self thus freezes its relations with the
Other[. Hobbes and Locke in the 17th century were articulating a process
already underway a century before, when merchants ships inadvertently
encountered cultures, societies, and peoples previously unknown to the
European Self:]{.underline} 23 When Vespucci speaks of a world he refers
to the old notion of ecumene, of a portion of the Earth fit for human
habitation. If he licitly designates the recently explored countries as
a new world, it is because he intends to announce the effective finding
of one of these other ecumenes (O'Gorman 1961: 34). Vespucci did not
consider the peoples of "the New World" as human; only Europe could
stamp them so. In the 1500s, such anxiety about difference stemmed from
Europe's peripheral location to Islam. In "bursting the bounds within
which Islam had confined it" (O'Gorman 1961: 90), **[Europe pushed its
ontology of fear and property onto Others, transforming them into
objects of and instruments for colonization, domination, exploitation,
and humiliation.]{.underline}** To justify these acts[, Europe had to
produce "texts of reason." Even when these seemed to be about
"dis-covery"]{.underline} (with emphasis on "covering") rather than fear
and domination for profit, [they nonetheless punctuated the terms of
relations between Self and Other as alterity, thereby fixing the
identities of both Self and Other as irreconcilably opposed. These
texts]{.underline}, along with newer ones produced today, [make apparent
that Eurocentrism]{.underline} (Amin 1989) [still undergirds the
Neoliberal approach to world politics.]{.underline} So what's a
postcolonial state to do? Space prohibits a more detailed discussion at
this point. **[Suffice it to say that we propose an alternative social
ontology elsewhere. We call it Worldism]{.underline}** [**It seeks not
to counter or overthrow the Liberal social ontology of fear and property
but rather show how it operates in relation to other traditions and
legacies.** Thus world politics comes from the entwinements between Self
and Other, West and]{.underline} 31 For more on Worldism, see
Agathangelou and Ling (2005). 24 Rest, occupier and occupied, despite
asymmetric capabilities and resources. 32 [In displacing Liberalism as
the only ontological game in town, Worldism moves world politics from a
position of fixed hegemony to one of recognition and engagement that
would lead, eventually, to transformation. This emancipatory
stance]{.underline}, in turn, makes an obligatory demand: in
[acknowledging the multiple agencies that make our world, we must also
accept our collective responsibility and accountability for
it]{.underline}. The "burden" is not the white man's alone.

#### The aff endorses a politics of Worldism that seeks to rupture the hegemonic epistemologies of the west by fore fronting Native epistemologies and social ontologies that begin from multiple ways of being in the world foreclosed by Western liberalism.

*Transforming World Politics: From Empire to Multiple Worlds.*
Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, 2009, pgs 85-92.)//Squirms

[Worldism presents world politics as a site of multiple worlds. These
refer to the various and contending ways of being, knowing, and relating
that have been passed onto us from previous generations.]{.underline}
Histories, languages, myths, and memories institutionalize and embody
multiple worlds through simple daily acts like cooking and eating,
singing and dancing, joking and playing but also through larger events
like trade, development, conﬂict, and war. [Worldism registers not only
the "difference" that comes from multiple worlds (]{.underline}see
Inayatullah and Blaney 2004[) but also their entwinements. Selves and
others reverberate,2 producing multi- and trans-subjectivities that
leave us legacies of reinforcement and conﬂict, reconstruction and
critique, reconciliation and resistance. Such syncretic engagements
belie seeming oppositions and contradictions among multiple worlds to
reveal their underlying connections despite hegemony's violent erasures.
On this basis, communities have opportunities to heal and recuperate so
they can build for another day, for another generation.]{.underline}
Worldism as everyday life enacts self--other reverberations and
syncretic engagements, especially by communities at the margins.
Worldism as an analytical framework theorizes about them. Both types of
worldist activity expose the problematic of empire in practice and
logics. Building on the postcolonial notion that all parties make
history, albeit with unequal access to power, worldism leads to an
undeniable conclusion: our mutual embeddedness makes us mutually
accountable. One cannot escape from the other. Mutual accountability
brings with it duties and responsibilities, to be sure, but also
possibilities: that is, (a) an internal dialectic of constant
questioning to check and problematize hegemony, so that (b) we can
expand our visions, strategies, and approaches beyond the narrow,
hegemonic conﬁnes of realism/liberal internationalism, in order to (c)
arrive at a more inclusive, conciliatory, and democratic world politics.
In brief, [worldism consists of two simultaneous processes: descriptive
and analytical. Worldism-as-description features the following: (a)
multi- and trans-subjectivities that institutionalize the social and
structural reverberations between selves and others; (b) the agency of
all parties, despite inequities and injustices, to create, build, and
articulate multiple worlds; (c) syncretic engagements that consolidate
the entwinements of multiple worlds into concrete strategies for change,
adjustment, adaptation, reformulation, and transformation; and (d)
community-building that integrates and accretes these syncretic
engagements despite denials of such efforts from hegemonic elites and
their ideologies. Worldism-as-analysis draws on the struggles and
learning undertaken in worldist daily life to emphasize: (a)
accountability as a hallmark of worldist inquiry that ensures (b) an
internal criticality to question, contest, and challenge hegemony, so
that we may (c) arrive at emancipatory construction even as we critique
and resist.]{.underline} The critical reader may interject: [Couldn't
"agency" and "accountability" in worldism be taken as a fancy way of
blaming the victim?]{.underline} Are Jews, for example, responsible for
the Holocaust; slaves for their enslavement; or any oppressed people for
their oppression? [Worldism as a politics of multiple relations subsumes
this liberal, individualist understanding of responsibility. Multiple
relations produce a web of effects and consequences to any kind of
decisions and/or set of practices.]{.underline} Accountability in
worldism asks: Who's involved, under what conditions, and through which
processes can we redress or transform the violence? What kinds of
understanding are generated to account for these relations and/or to
make them invisible? [Without the painful concession that all of us,
"abusers," "victims," and "innocent bystanders" alike, contribute to the
production of hegemonic violence, whether it results in domestic abuse
(see Adler and Ling 1995) or state violence (see Ling 1994), we may
never realize how violence is conceived, generated, and sustained. By
extension, we will never understand ways to end it. Instead, in our
injuries and (self) alienation, we may reproduce time and again the same
conditions of violence or hegemony that afﬂicted us in the past and
which seems the only option for the present. Suspended political ideals,
in this case, could also block us from action and change]{.underline}.
Worldist agency and accountability compel us to face the complicities
(including our own) that sustain violence in the making of history, so
that we may, as Marx exhorted, change it. Where do these ideas come
from?, our reader may ask. Let us delineate the intellectual precedents
to worldism. Worldism draws on constructivism and postmodernism but also
differs from them. [Worldism shares with constructivism its emphasis on
intersubjectivity, and with postmodernism its insights on asymmetrical
difference: that is, the norms, institutions, practices, and behaviors
that set up certain subjects and subjectivities as more privileged and
protected than others. Power, then, cannot be reduced to an objectiﬁed,
reiﬁed condition of who's "on top" or who "has more" but instead results
from agents contributing to macro-political structures like ideology,
organization, and capitalist relations. Power redeﬁned in these terms
stems from an intersubjective consensus within a context of material
conditions and relations.]{.underline} The crux here lies in the
framing. Since narration as a process is never complete, the story can
always change.3 However, worldism departs from constructivism by asking:
What kinds of intersubjectivity are constructed, by whom, and for what
purpose, and how do theories of subjectivity restructure the world
"otherwise"? And is this how we want the world to be? Not probing into
the social relations of intersubjectivity, according to worldism,
effectively erases the power politics of meaning, including the
political economy behind such constructions. And unlike postmodernism,
worldism distinguishes power from the resistance it induces. Contra
Foucault (1994), [we differentiate between the colonizer and colonized
in their experiences of colonial power (see Stoler 2002) and the
entwinements that follow, both reinforcing and conﬂicting complicity
(see Ling 2002b). Not doing so implicitly reinforces the imperialist
assertion that "this is the way the world is": that is, it is not open
to alternative concepts, discourses, strategies, or ways of
being.]{.underline} These gaps in constructivism and postmodernism
return us to the conventional treatment of power as domination, pure and
simple. Ronen Palan (2000), for instance, ﬁnds a strain of conservative
realism in Alexander Wendt's "naturalist" version of constructivism,
primarily because he claims to offer a method only, and not an
interpretation, of politics. Wendt (2005) himself admits as much. For
similar reasons, Samir Amin (2004) calls postmodernism an "ideological
accessory" to elite, bourgeois interests just as Aijaz Ahmad (1992)
considers post-structuralist theories serve as alibis for imperialism.
Both postmodernism and poststructuralism value critique and
deconstruction over political action, thereby keeping de facto power
intact. We note that although critical theories like postmodernism and
constructivism open up spaces to think about shifting power politics,
they fall short of transforming the very asymmetries they critique.
Inattention to structural, material interest and lack of integrating the
Other analytically -- that is, as a substantive maker of the world --
undermines their claims of emancipatory social theory. Ultimately, the
Other becomes a repository of raw materials for hegemonic actors and
sites in the North to process. [Worldism acknowledges a deep
intellectual debt to postcolonial studies.]{.underline} Here, race,
gender, sexuality, class, and nationality serve as analytics and
substance in examinations of power relations. Postcolonial studies
demystify empire's boast, like Kipling's "White Man's Burden," that the
imperial Self makes the world for all Others. And that world is
unidimensional (topdown state power), unilateral (center dominates
periphery), and unilinear (past--present--future). [Postcolonial studies
record a more nuanced and multiple history by problematizing the ways
colonial power is imposed on the colonized. That is, colonization
involves more than a unilateral and mechanical domination of the
subjugated by colonizers and their states.]{.underline} As documented by
postcolonial studies, tensions and contradictions emerge from these
relations (Said 1979; Spivak 1999), leading to adaptations and
integrations between hegemonic selves and subaltern others. From this
interaction, "colonizers" and "colonized" produced something together
over the course of time that neither anticipated nor perhaps desired but
which all learned to live with, and eventually called their own. Divides
along lines of property, race, class, language, religion, and ideology
did not disappear. They fused, rather, into hybrid, creole, or mélange
cultures that, nonetheless, contested these categories constantly
(Ashcroft, Grifﬁths, and Tifﬁn 1995; Lewis and Mills 2003). [In
recognizing that colonizer and colonized mutually construct their
subjectivities, postcolonial studies attribute to both the legacies of
power that we face today.]{.underline} Note, for example, Britain's
principal instrument of colonial and imperial power: the East India
Company. Sudipta Sen (1998) shows that, contrary to claims that the
British brought capitalism to India, the East India Company had to
adjust to pre-existing market structures and political relations to gain
access to the thriving trade already in place in northern India.4 Only
through this kind of entry could the East India Company later redirect
the trade to its favor. L.H.M. Ling (2002b) traces how institutional
elites in East Asia learned syncretically and "interstitially" between
two world orders -- the agrarian-based, cosmo-moral universe of
Confucian governance and the Westphalian inter-state system of commerce
and trade -- to cumulate into what we know as Asian capitalism today.
Walter Mignolo (2000) highlights the "gnosis" of thought and action,
Self and Other, that comes from centuries of transgressing and
reformulating the colonial boundaries that comprise Latin America. Of
course, those subjected to hegemony must accommodate others more than
those who perpetrate it. Yet [hegemony's very asymmetry highlights the
resilience and creativity of the marginalized. Ordinary people can
journey across subjectivities to engage syncretically with others, even
under conditions of poverty and inequality, to rebuild, reconstruct, and
reorganize communities.]{.underline} Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua
(1983) characterize their straddling of multiple worlds as life on the
"borderlands." Typically, they point out, women of color from the South
must bear the biggest burden of negotiating the multiple worlds of
language, culture, class, and gender to survive whitemajority society in
the North despite systemic discrimination and obstacles. Still, they are
able to exercise internal reserves of freedom, thought, and action to
sort through hegemony, not simply surrender to it. Similarly, the
indigenous populations of the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand have
entered into treaties with their white majorities to retain aspects of
indigenous ontologies by formalizing them in Western institutions
(Shilliam 2008). Another example comes from Ashis Nandy (1988).
[Gandhi's strategy of nonviolence, Nandy claims, engulfed Britain's
imperial hypermasculinity within a more complex understanding of gender
and power drawn from India's classical mythologies. Gandhi succeeded,
Nandy argues, not by overthrowing the British empire with military might
but by displacing it. A worldist perspective adds that Gandhi's success
also came from ordinary people who were reconstituting their daily lives
already under, in, through, and despite empire's desires and
violences.]{.underline} Indeed, Gandhi himself embodied that
reconstitution despite his call to Indians to return to a more
"authentic" way of life, as exempliﬁed by his use of the spinning wheel.
For this reason, Gandhi could push for the syncretic efforts that seeded
India's revolution and independence. Relational agency extends to a
method of inquiry as well. [Edward Said (1994) initiated a contrapuntal
method to decipher the interplays between center and periphery,
colonizer and colonized, the seen and unseen, in the production of
colonial/imperialist power relations. This contrapuntal approach, Geeta
Chowdhry (2007: 105) elaborates, helps us to historicize "texts,
institutions and practices \[by\] interrogating their sociality and
materiality \[and\] the hierarchies and the power-knowledge nexus
embedded in them." From this basis, in Said's words, we may recuperate a
"non-coercive and non-dominating knowledge"]{.underline} (Said, quoted
in Chowdhry 2007: 105). Postcolonial-feminist studies extend
contrapuntality to recognize the entwinements of gender/sexuality with
race and other aspects of colonial power relations. [These include
"analyses of bio-politics, expansionist capitalism, and questions of
neoliberal political economy \[that\] emphasize the gendered, sexual,
and racial hierarchies/genealogies of colonial and postcolonial
relations, epistemologies, representational techniques, territoriality,
law, and policy-making"]{.underline} (Banerjee and Ling 2006: 13). [Two
common concerns bind these inquiries: (a) How do global structures like
capital, the military-industrial complex, or imperialism integrate with
local patriarchal relations despite seeming conﬂicts and contradictions
between them, and (b) What do the outcomes mean for the marginalized,
the exploited, and the subaltern5]{.underline} (see Shohat and Stam
1994; Alexander and Mohanty 1997; Chowdhry and Nair 2002; Ling 2002b;
Rai 2003; Eisenstein 2004; Agathangelou 2004b, 2006; Alexander 2005;
Franklin 2005; Banerjee 2006)? Not one but multiple worlds inform
postcolonial studies. Some reveal sources and kinds of power previously
hidden, dismissed, or denied. "Subaltern mimicry" for Homi Bhabha
(1994), for example, subverts the hegemonic convention that the
colonizer is always separate from and superior to the colonized.
Mimicry's artiﬁce, he proposes, shocks the colonizer into accepting a
possible parity with the colonized.6 Center-periphery relations thus
become exposed as more complex than mere expressions of power from the
centered Self to the peripheralized Other (see Escobar 1995). Other
studies show that peoples and cultures comply with one another
constantly and intimately in their private lives, even when elites deny
such interactions in their public pronouncements (see Todorov 1984). As
Ann Stoler (2002) demonstrates, the "colonial" Self could not maintain
the ofﬁcial ﬁction of superiority to and exclusion of the "native" Other
as the latter daily serviced "whites" in their barracks, their ofﬁces,
their homes, and their beds. Postcolonial theorizations, however, serve
as a point of departure only. They do not explain, for example, why and
how it is possible to negotiate across multiple worlds but, instead,
only that we do. Evidence ranges from anti-colonial struggles to
revolutionary projects to everyday acts of learning and resistance,
revealing the ontological and epistemological praxes that enable agents
to wrench freedom from violence and liberation from annihilation.
Clearly, different worldviews are involved. But postcolonial
theorizations do not broach the politics of "what is" (i.e.,
socio-ontological visions and the nature of the subject within) or its
interpretations. Relatedly, postcolonial studies do not probe into how
individuals, communities, and societies enact the visions, beliefs,
norms, or theories behind "knowing what is" (epistemology) and the ways
to undertake such inquiry (methodology). These pertain especially when
historical circumstances bring one ontological tradition into contact
with another. Yet these encounters and entanglements fuel the very
hybrid, creole, and mélange practices that postcolonial studies document
so extensively. Worldism makes explicit what postcolonial studies imply.
That is, interactions among worldviews reframe signiﬁcant areas of
thought, action, and being, even when original, deﬁning principles and
concepts are retained. Worldism adds: How do we learn from these
syncretic adaptations so we could devise strategies for less violent
social relations? Worldism as a descriptive process provides clues to
such possibilities. "How" and "why" constitute the central focus of
worldism as an analytical project. [Worldism proposes a relationality of
social ontologies. That is, worldism as everyday practice springs from
the interactions among contending social ontologies and their legacies
of reinforcement and conﬂict]{.underline}. Worldism orients us to the
existence of multiple social ontologies that make possible a condition
of being. [Epistemologically, worldism focuses on the interpretive
processes behind these formations, their interactions with and relations
to one another, and the larger context that sustains them. From this
epistemological orientation comes a relational-materialist methodology:
i.e., social formations reﬂect a dialectics of relations and
structures]{.underline}. For example, [worldism asks: What are the
ontological and epistemological presumptions that keep "desire
industries" separate from considerations of "national security"? What
are the "processes of creation" embedded in these contestations?7 Such
questions lead to others that begin to rupture dominant articulations in
world politics that prohibit such queries in the ﬁrst
place:]{.underline} e.g., how do ruling elites deﬁne "desire industries"
and "national security", and why, and how do these characterizations
differ from or resemble what ordinary people experience in daily life,
and what do the disparities or similarities reveal about power practices
in the world political economy? [Asking these questions foreground how
relevant structures (capitalist/mixed economies), institutions
(neoliberal/authoritarian), practices (hypermasculine/hyperfeminine),
and social relations (race, gender/sexuality, class, nationality) bind
"desire industries" with "national security." From these conjunctions,
we come closer to identifying the material and epistemic productions
that connect "desire industries" with "national security,"]{.underline}
despite public pronouncements to the contrary. [The Greek concept of
poisies characterizes worldism. In poisies, worlds emerge from constant
interplays, both interpretive and material, between selves and others.
They create ceaseless, multiple constructions of being and becoming that
transform familiar boundaries -- material, geographical, capital,
cultural, spiritual -- into unfamiliar reconstructions of
"we]{.underline}." Speciﬁcally, poisies refers to different realms of
existence (social ontologies) as inter-subjectively shared communal
practices and languages. [These mobilize speciﬁc subjectivities to
enable collectively-formed social practices and constructs.]{.underline}
The Greek verb poieo means "to make." It refers to all kinds of
purposive activities. More than the instrumental deﬁnition of "to make"
found in English, poieo connotes the deployment of one's power (ergon)
that stems from the sets of relations and skills needed to realize this
purpose, including the different systems of and contexts for
interpreting those relations and skills. For instance, when Odysseus
sought to escape from the island of Calypso, he "made" a raft. But he
was not just making a particular raft. He was also drawing on a larger
vision, purpose, and path of social relations that motivated the making
of this particular raft for a life journey. The sufﬁx "sis" to poie-sis
always indicates an active, dynamic force or purposive activity that
enables various kinds of social relations, subjectivities, and things.
Poisies, then, not only describes the world; it also articulates the
world. In so doing, poisies shapes the world. As Pindar notes, logos is
"the living word which is the power of life" that is also a "vision of
reason" (Pindar, quoted in Detienne 1996: 48[). Poisies in worldism
draws on this notion of the ergon of articulation to disrupt hegemony
from discursive or epistemic regimes (Parry 1971: 20). In referring to
relations drawn from speech, deliberations, contestations, and
negotiations, poisies delineates (a) the drama of theoretical
imaginations, fantasies, and other kinds of linguistic signiﬁcations and
their social relations, (b) directions of change, but not in
teleological terms, to render the world less violent, (c) the physical/
material embodiments that structure our worlds, and (d) the
possibilities that can emerge from contestations among social ontologies
and their contingent power relations]{.underline} (Agathangelou
forthcoming).

#### Worldism carves a hole into hegemony through OntoPoetics. OntoPoetics allows us to rethink dominant social relations and explore the pain the west has inflicted via the foreclosure of different ways of living and in doing so heal. OntoPoetics enables us to critique liberal and hegemonic worlds through the fiction and poetry and in the process actualize a multiplicity of immanent worlds

\[O\]ur history (or our histories) is not totally accessible to
historians. Their methodology restricts them to the role of colonial
chronicle. Our chronicle is behind the dates, behind known facts: we are
Words behind writing. Only poetic knowledge, ﬁctional knowledge,
literary knowledge, in short, artistic knowledge can discover us,
understand us, and bring us, evanescent, back to the resuscitation of
consciousness. (Jean Bernabé, quoted in Mignolo 2000: 245, original
emphasis) [Art]{.underline} offers one means of countering the "colonial
chronicle." It [can challenge and disrupt the dominant norm that the
world needs incessant capitalist exploitations and violences, that the
state is ﬁrst and foremost sovereign, and that hypermasculine whiteness
must be in charge]{.underline}. In so doing, art shifts the burden of
what needs to be done (e.g., "development") from those at the margins
(e.g., "third-world states") to where it belongs, the imperium. [It is
the center, after all, that secures the proﬁts needed for systemic
reproduction through brutalities likes racism, sexism, heterosexism, and
war.]{.underline} But contrary to what is suggested by the quote above,
art is not pristine. Nor is it ideal or devoid of its own politics. Art
does not simply "discover" or "understand" us, "bringing" us to
"consciousness." Instead, we stress, [art serves as a site of struggle
and labor, like any other productive enterprise. Its value lies in what
artistic knowledge conveys and how. For this reason, juxtaposing
"artistic works" with the "colonial chronicle" highlights the social
relations that make both possible and keep each in asymmetrical
relations with the other.]{.underline} These gaps in power and knowledge
production need to be addressed to stem the historic violence of
hegemonic world politics[.]{.underline} On this basis, we may identify
possibilities for healing and rebuilding. [Poetry-as-method points to
trans-subjective, multiply-produced modes of relating and imagining. We
are asked]{.underline} to refrain, for the moment, from ﬁxing identity
into one thing and not the other: that is, [to suspend the hegemonic
designation of any ontological starting point. Shifting to this
probative space helps us to recognize (a) the multiplicity of worlds,
(b) the processes through which subjects (re)produce themselves and
their]{.underline} worlds in a delicate tapestry of asymmetrical social
relations[, and (c) possible ways of reconﬁguring these processes so
selves and others can forge new, less violent, and transformative
relations.]{.underline} Poetry, according to Gaston Bachelard, is
impudent. It breaks into "the dead formula of a system" with its
"dictatorship of the mind" (Bachelard, quoted in Gaudin 1987: xxi),
jarring the imagination to produce new images, relationships, and
possibilities for action. Bachelard emphasizes that [language acts by
bearing a world within]{.underline}: "For Bachelard," writes Colette
Gaudin (1987: xxi), ["poetic language works, not as a revelation of past
conﬂicts or traumas, but as a reconciling force which at the same time
effectuates and enlarges subjective life." Poetry intrudes upon
perception (the status quo) to "reverse the real and the ﬁgurative
poles" of meaning to open new vistas of thought and vision]{.underline}
(Gaudin 1987: xlii[). In this way, past connects with present, solitude
with communication, "reconciling the world and the subject"]{.underline}
(Gaudin 1987: xxxv). Such reverie comes not easily. It is earned through
disciplined reading, writing, and thinking. There can be no "lazy
dreamer" (Gaudin 1987: xxviii). Imagination frees us of ourselves and
the known so we can enter an experimental, exploratory trip to otherness
(Gaudin 1987: 16). Worldism inverts Bachelard's formulation. From ﬁnding
the material in the poetic[, worldism discovers the poetic in
materiality, particularly divisions of labor conﬁgured by race, gender,
sexuality, class, nation-state, and culture. "]{.underline}These
conditions and dimensions make up the echosmonde," according to Nevzat
Soguk (2006: 385), "the echoes of the world that urgently need to be
'sensed', 'cited', and registered across the world." For example, the
neoliberal world economy does not just structure the world according to
certain interests, products, and markets. It also imagines the world in
particular ways (see Agathangelou and Killian 2006). Marx ﬁrst theorized
about capitalism's imagination as "commodity fetishism" and
"alienation." We emphasize capitalism's overall worldview, particularly
its latest neoliberal variant (see Cameron and Palan 2004[). In exposing
neoliberalism's nightmare scenario of excess built on fear, greed, and
violence, worldism helps us realize that we don't have to accept, share,
or participate in this vision. There's a choice. Through poetic
articulation and practice, worldism registers the variety of visions
that contest this project. And through syncretic negotiations, worldism
signals a multitude of approaches to life, living, and being. From these
processes, we can identify more viable and sustainable relations to deal
with different structural constraints.]{.underline} Roland Bleiker
(2000) and others (Costantinou 2000; Sylvester 2001; Soguk 2006; Rajaram
2006) apply these insights to world politics. [They see poetry
as]{.underline} a source and means of "critical history memory." Like
Glissant, these theorists treat poetry's echos-monde as [a means to
prevent hegemony by "stretching the boundaries of our
minds"]{.underline} (Bleiker 2000: 281). [Worldism adds that this
intervention prohibits hegemony's saturation of multiple
socio-ontologies and the contestations among them.]{.underline} Soguk
elaborates with a reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict:
\[O\]ntopoetics reveals in its imposed tempos, postures, and rhythms the
work of the occupation in Israel--Palestine. The massive interventions
in the land fold into sweeping interventions on bodies, creating unique
ontopoetical conditionality both for the Palestinians and the Israelis.
Visible and invisible conditioners -- from walls, ditches, tunnels, and
barbed wires to checkpoints, lines, work permits (given or denied),
residency documents (issued yet subject to revocation), and bus routes
mapping perfectly to locations of suicide bombings reveal the concurrent
political rhythms and tempos imposed on the land and the bodies. (Soguk
2006: 384) This lineage of violence connects Palestinians and Israelis.
It includes the various conditions that resist and contribute to such
violence at the same time: e.g., "checkpoints," "lines," "work permits,"
"residency documents." Worldism extends this inquiry by recognizing the
contending social ontologies that operate behind these struggles and
their acts of violence, conditioning, and contestations. Still, the
critical reader may ask, how much is our identity dependent on those
stories that we cannot control or change? In response, we paraphrase
Robert Cox (1986): [all stories are "for someone" and "for some
purpose." If these change, so do the stories. But we need more than an
"aesthetic turn" in world politics. Poetry serves as a method or site of
labor for transforming and reconstructing our worlds]{.underline}.
Wait!, our critical reader could interject again, isn't poetry exactly
the opposite of what worldists claim to want, to radically democratize
social relations? Isn't poetry elitist by nature? Wouldn't something
else, like ﬁlm, enable more democratic engagement and participation?
After all, ﬁlm reaches more people than poetry. Film-making requires
technology not yet readily available to the masses.7 Whereas, poetry --
whether in the form of folktales or songs or simple ditties -- has
expressed human needs, goals, aspirations, and desires from ancient to
present times (see Nepali 2003; Arons 2004). Contrary to popular
misimpressions of ﬁction and poetry as an elitist pastime, both can
articulate a demos that is substantively democratic. Unlike a ﬁlmmaker
or even a painter, a poet or singer or storyteller doesn't need a lot of
materials or capital or technology to produce a narrative. The purpose
of using ﬁction/poetry as a method, moreover, is not to reach a common
endgoal -- i.e., a uniﬁed interpretation -- but to engage in a process
of public deliberation where we identify spaces of contestation -- such
as asymmetrical power relations and why these exist -- to forge
connections and solidarities. From this process of speaking with,
listening to, critiquing, and collectively engaging with others, we
begin to account for the multiple worlds that people come from, live by,
and die for. [Fiction and poetry, in short, serve as sites of
contestation over power. Telling stories through narrative or poetic
form not only provides voice but it also demonstrates the variety and
scope of voices that exist, thereby curbing the hegemony of a singular,
"ﬂat" narrative. In the process, we not only alter our original stories
but also produce new ones together with others.]{.underline} No mere
reﬂection of postmodern polyvalence, [this method shows that poetry and
ﬁction can help us critically politicize social ontologies, their
contingent relations, and aesthetic subjectivities.]{.underline} These
bear power implications for the imperium's privileging of Self over all
Others. Excavating the silences, lulls, and gaps between these voices
does not signal an end to understanding but a beginning of negotiations
across them. [We can suspend, if only for the moment, the pressures of
power to foreclose social relations in their multiple registers. In so
doing, we are no longer subject to narrowly-punctuated social relations
that support some interests at the expense of the many due to
presumptions that fear and property dictate human
existence.]{.underline} Let us see, then, how a worldist approach turns
poetry and ﬁction into a daily practice of political critique. The
following excerpts make explicit the contestations, tensions, and
disjunctures that entwine selves with others, loosening the rigid
borders that alienate us from visions of what's possible and
sustainable. For Tsiolis (1997), the critical-political poem offers a
way out of the injustices and inequities that produce the "pained self"
("I did X" or "I thought Y") by generating a transformative vision of
what to strive for in the world ("the world is like Z"). He cites Kiki
Dimoulas's poem, "Unexpectations."8 In it, Dimoulas sees a picture of a
soldier, long dead. Yet she infuses new life into the bereaved by
challenging the ﬁction and practice of erecting boundaries of all sorts
-- physical, emotional, national, cultural, religious. The bereaved thus
ﬁnds a larger, more embracing community than the isolating sovereignty
of grief. It's been years since any thief Set foot in my house Even for
coffee. I deliberately leave the pot unlocked. For Vrasidas Karalis,
Dimoulas's [poetry "transubstantiates": "the universe becomes world once
again, agony becomes longing, absence appears as time redemption."9 We
read Dimoulas's poetry as a deconstruction of dominant narratives of
social relations while simultaneously reconstructing with language
another vision, another sensibility.]{.underline} Her world has
experienced the dissolution of postwar humanity and ﬁnds itself,
literally, at a dead end. [She intervenes in this insecure landscape
with a creative, dynamic re-envisioning of a "new" world: "through
astonishment and surprise . . . her lines suggest the stability of a
world that eyes can't see, but which becomes whole through its imaginary
reconstruction within the poem as an organic whole."]{.underline}10
Neither time nor love nor the dead soldier is lost. Rather, all maintain
"a continuous and active presence. Through her lines, personal time is
born anew and is accomplished forever as collective experience and
prismatic image."11 [In this way, Dimoulas fuses social ontology with
politics and aesthetics]{.underline} (Agathangelou 2004b; Agathangelou
and Killian 2006). [Through poetry, words and memories and whispered
dreams can be recuperated. And this process returns to our collective
consciousness the possibility of change. We can perceive worlds other
than the one espoused by the neoliberal imperium. The pain of death and
absence mobilizes connections previously thought not
possible.]{.underline} Stories of the everyday and ordinary challenge
master fables and mirages, opening another window through which we can
contemplate ourselves as well as others (Darby 2004). [Realization of
pain, injustice, and terror may motivate this way of being but it calls
us, also, to remember humanity's ability to heal and rebuild amidst
chaos, disorder, and insecurity]{.underline}. Such ordinary living may
not promise the perfect dream; it recognizes, instead, the urgency of
being present here, now, in this world, collectively and critically.
[Dimoulas also shows how we can see social relations in a new light. She
compels us to face honestly the material structures that lead to unequal
social relations. In her poem, "A Minute's Licence," she recalls a
burglary at a neighbor's house. She proffers another response to the
sense of threat, fear, and violation that burglaries typically
induce:]{.underline} Love me as long as you don't live. Yes yes the
impossible's enough for me. Once I was loved by that. Love me as long as
you don't live. For I've no news of you. And heaven forbid that the
absurd should show no signs of life. [With the door/pot unlocked,
Dimoulas re-positions Self (homeowner) and Other (thief). The
thief-Other becomes a guest, not an intruder. The terror of boundary
violation transforms, instead, into a social exchange]{.underline} ("for
coffee"). Relatedly, [Dimoulas urges us to shift the faultlines of
hegemonic narratives by inquiring into the thief-Other -- why he robs --
as well as about the homeowner-Self -- why can we afford the luxury of
not locating our lives at the stakes of danger? Even if we do rob, say,
through "innovative" accounting practices, why are we rarely caught,
sentenced, and imprisoned by law and order? These questions highlight
how the Self is not just any "self." It has a proﬁle which is
racialized, gendered, and classed (i.e., this subject can avoid
dangerous methods) and it is always in a relationship with the "other"
who also has a proﬁle that is gendered, raced, and classed.]{.underline}
This relationship depends on practices of violence and complicity to
create and sustain the "self" in asymmetrical relations to the "other."
But the question is: Is this relationship sustainable? Let us now share
another story. It tells of multiple journeys "out there" and "in here,"
for fulﬁllment and against estrangement.

## Method Extension -- Black Matriarch

#### Chaos becomes inscribed in the being of the black matriarch post emancipation because there is a detatchment from the heteronormative state of the white nuclear family which delimits the scope of property obtained through reproduction and denies the sovereignty of black women.

In part one of this dissertation, I established that [[the Black female

space during slavery]{.mark}. Under antebellum slavery the [Black female

roams the earth,]{.mark} [the Black female is a body out of place.
]{.mark}]{.underline}[I]{.mark}n this chapter of my dissertation, I also
focus on the [[chaos that the Black female body and her increase the
"Black family" cause]{.mark} in the Moynihan Report [and for settler
colonial space making practices]{.mark}.I track the figure of [the Black
matriarch]{.mark} as she [is surveilled]{.mark} and regulated
[by]{.mark} the [discursive]{.mark} [power]{.mark} of the Moynihan
Report. [The Black matriarch appears as]{.mark} a [chaos]{.mark}
inducing body [that disrupts the heteronormative institution of the
family]{.mark} and the settler order it helps produce. I contend that
[the]{.mark} report's discursive [construction]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
failed [black female gender and sexuality, failed Black families]{.mark}
and what Lorenzo Veracini would call "non-improvable" people is an
attempt to naturalize the settler colonial order[.The Moynihan Report,
like all projects of settler colonialism]{.mark}, must place Blackness.
Settler colonialism [must manage Black people and Black
spaces]{.mark}.]{.underline} Patrick Wolfe argues that settler
colonialism is a structure that becomes more and more complex over time.
As it adapts it will need to incorporate various modes of power. Wolfe
states that[, When [invasion is recognized as a structure rather than an
event]{.mark}, its [history does not stop when it moves from the era of
frontier homicide]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, narrating that history
involves charting the continuities, discontinuities, adjustments, and
departures whereby a logic that initially informed frontier killing
transmutes into different modalities, discourses and institutional
formations as it undergirds the historical development and
complexification of settler society.Drawing upon Wolfe's work, I argue
that we need [to [theorize when settler colonialism's modalities,
discourses, and institutional formations concern themselves with Black
femaleness]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} concern or [management of Blackness
does not]{.mark} necessarily [happen in a linear
fashio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark} with the first target being Native
bodies and then onward. I intend to sharpen and complicate analyses of
settler [colonialism through an illumination of the anti-Black
modalities through which settler colonial normalizing power works. I
focus specifically on the way [the Black matriarch becomes a site for
rehabilitation.]{.mark} She is [a space to fix and order for the
maintenance of the settler colonial order]{.mark}. Scholars' focus on
the report's [surveillance of Black gender, sexuality, and child rearing
while necessary, conceals the way that the report's productive power is
informed by and also structures settler colonial
power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In order to reveal the ways that
[[the]{.mark} biopolitical [management of Black females, "families" and
ghetto life is constitutive of settler colonial formations,]{.mark} I
draw]{.underline} upon critical geography, settler colonial studies,
Native feminist analyses and Black women's spatial analyses. Drawing
upon Katherine McKittrick, I think of Black women's spatial analyses and
geographies as [[processes of mapping the social order, naming imagined
and real spaces and creating places where Black women's desires can be
pursue]{.underline}d.]{.mark}

#### We must theorize place and landscape through an understanding of the Black matriarch and property in order to think settler colonialism and antiblackness alongside each other.

- Note: this evidence is also a response to settler colonialism.

In order to make spatial and temporal links between the space and time
of genocide (which continues) and the space and time of slavery (and
ongoing anti-Black racism), I employ palimpsestic methods which can
attend to a number of different spaces and different historical moments
at once. I use the work of Jacqui Alexander and the work of cultural
landscape scholar Richard Schein to help guide me through this method of
time and space scrambling[. Schein argues that in order to truly
understand how landscape matters [one must theorize not only the "place
of the cultural landscape in the social relations and spatial
arrangements of daily life" but also "how a particular, identifiable
cultural landscape in this place is related and connected to landscapes
and social processes in other places."]{.mark}]{.underline} This call to
understand how landscapes are connected and related to one another gives
me the confidence that [the theoretical risks I am taking in attempting
to [connect "Black" landscapes like the plantation, the Black matriarch
and the disorganized family to property]{.mark},]{.underline} conquest,
and Native genocide are worthwhile, necessary and politically useful. An
important intervention that Schein makes is the development of a
critique of Pierce Lewis's conceptualization of the landscape as a
"series of sedimentary layers of social accretion", or time periods
layered on top of one another[. This [layering creates the effect of
linear time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Schein argues that it may be
more useful to "begin by viewing the landscape as a palimpsest rather
than a cultural strata" or linear time. By using the palimpsest, [Schein
[enables a conceptualization of landscapes as spaces of "erasure and
overwriting" where different scripts can co-exist.]{.mark} The
palimpsest assumes that there is an intermingling and interplay of
different historical eras as well as historical and contemporary actors.
[The co-existence of settler colonialism and slavery as distinct forms
of productive and repressive power that construct one
anothe]{.mark}]{.underline}[r]{.mark} is what I will attempt to reveal
using counter epistemologies that subvert the linear, positivist and
settler colonial vantage point. [[Settler colonial epistemologies
and]{.mark} vantage point ([sight) separate the time and space of
(ongoing) conquest from the time and space of (ongoing) anti-Black
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Jacqui Alexander's elaboration of
the palimpsest, in Pedagogies of Crossing, as an analytic from with to
think about colonial notions of time and space have been used to close
the chasm created by the ideological notion of distance[[. Distance
functions as a colonial ideology of time and space that makes different
forms of colonial power seem distant, unrelated, and
incommensurable.]{.mark} If the [coloniality of slavery and settler
colonialism are viewed as distant and therefore unrelated, this
viewpoint frustrates efforts to develop frames to analyze them together
and understand their relationship to one another.]{.mark} Alexander has
developed [a decolonial framework]{.mark} which [allows]{.mark} me [to
bring colonial tropes of Black non-normativity like the "matriarch", and
the "disorganized family" into proximity and relationship to settler
colonial tropes of normativity like the "patriarch", the stable "white
family," and property.]{.mark}]{.underline} Alexander's decolonization
of the ordering of time and space compels us to take [seriously [the way
the inscriptions of settler colonialism remain visible within anti-Black
racism and the ways that anti-Black racism's trace can be perceived in
settler colonial discourses]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition to
Alexander's palimpsest, I [[rely on Black feminist analyses that enable
a new way of thinking about notions of female gender, property, family
organization, tropes of disorganization and their relationship to the
settler nation.]{.mark} [My Black feminist analyses will be read]{.mark}
for the ways that [they enable an examination of the production of
space]{.mark}.]{.underline} The sources that I have chosen explicitly
link the Moynihan Report's spatial and social metaphors to conquest,
Native genocide, slavery and various practices of settlement that create
settler space, settler and non-settler subjectivities.

#### Black women as an identity category is most salient when deployed as a refusal of the organizing binary of male and female, and therefore dwells in Black feminism and trans feminism as an undoing of identity categories and opening space for unrepresentable futures.

- Note: this is also an answer to queer theory and trans studies that
  does not account for the unique position of Black women or Black
  feminism.

[How does the category of woman function]{.underline} here? [Who is it
able to hold and how is it able to hold difference]{.underline}? Those
of us who are interested in Black liberation must be weary of the "and"
in "[trans and cis"]{.underline} as it purports to have reckoned with
the real difference and fissures that rest between trans and cis. It is
a question of relationality. How do we/they belong to one another? The
"and" here is not natural as it [seeks to bring transgender women into
the fold of the category women]{.underline} (read cisgender), a category
that has been critiqued by Black and Women of Color feminists as [a
category that continuously fails]{.underline}, fails [to articulate
clearly what it is that makes some women]{.underline}, who are not
white, who are not middle class, [illegible as the imagined
universalized representative subject]{.underline} [of the
category]{.underline}. So we are left asking (1) Are Black women, women?
(When? How?) (2) If not, why do we hold on to that category "woman" at
all? (When? How?) It seems to me that many scholars and organizers
assume the answer to Sojourner Truth's question, "ain't I a woman?" is
"Yes!" But what if we instead took the gift of Truth as a proposition to
dwell in the question? Do **[models of inclusion prohibit us from
thinking about or asking for something else]{.underline}**? Even more
challenging: **[what would something else look like without the
organizing binary of male and female]{.underline}**? And even more
challenging than that: what about all the ways we love gender, being
seen as either this or that? [We work within these limited categorical
identities even though we know]{.underline} their limitations, even when
we see [that they can't account for the nuances of holistic
being.]{.underline} I think **[we fear non-existence without
them]{.underline}** as a sign post to remind us that we are human.
[**The fear** of non-existence **is** a **logical** fear **for Black
people and queer people as our relationship to premature death is**
almost always already **pre-determined**]{.underline} under racial
capitalism and patriarchy. But the non-existence that I want those of us
who are working toward Black liberation and gender liberation or gender
self-determination is the non-existence or erasure that we impose on one
another consciously and unconsciously. As our grammars shift and change
to be more inclusive, particularly when it comes to a Black queer
feminist politic that consciously names "cis and trans" as a modifier of
"woman," we must be careful about what the and then dislodges. [It is
not productive to simply add transgender women to the category of woman
without thinking through the ways]{.underline} that transgender women
force us to consider again how ["woman" as a category is a
failure.]{.underline} [If we simply add "woman(cis and trans)" as the
proper subjects of feminist politics]{.underline}, then [what happens to
men who have lived as women?]{.underline} Are they no longer a part of
the narrative? Are we able to hold the stories of both CeCe McDonald,
Marissa Alexander, and Kye Peterson6 under this inclusive Black Queer
Feminist framing? I seek a Black feminist praxis that can hold all of
these people, but in order for that to be the case we may have to
disentangle ourselves from a reliance on "woman" and instead think
through the ways in which femininity and masculinity are moving in and
across all kinds of bodies. [The category "woman" remains attached to
notions of biological authenticity and realness that inevitably reaches
its limits when trying to capture bodies that shift]{.underline}, trans
bodies. Basically, what I am getting at is that we can and should shift
our grammar and language to be more inclusive, but understand too that
the way we think of women/men, this binary is undone (and sometimes
redone) by transgender and gender-nonconforming people whose gender
journeys aren't always linear. MB: I'm always at a bit of a loss with
respect to the question of whether we should retain "woman" as a
category on a few fronts: first, there is an ethical dimension to the
extent to which I can even enter such a question by virtue of my
identification, which is itself deeply troubled and unsettled.7 Second,
[marginalized folks do often find joy in claiming the category, so the
extermination of it might in fact do a kind of harm]{.underline} (which
is not to the exclusion of the very harm done by the category itself,
known or not). [This is]{.underline} all in part [why I am interested
more in politicized identities,]{.underline} following Cathy Cohen; [why
I am interested in the work that we do as the identities that come to
subjectivate us,]{.underline} rather than presuming that identity is an
immutable possession. The phrase you use, the "place of the demand," is
right where I want to dwell, and it is that demand that I'm interested
in. It seems to me that to do or be a Black or trans feminist, or both,
is to heed that demand. The "identity," of sorts, of one who uptakes the
demand Black feminism and trans feminism bear---and thus the eruptive
volatility and multiplicity simmering beneath and alongside each of
them---concerns less a delimited entity that is a Black and/or trans
feminist and more in the vein of Nathaniel Mackey's "enmity," a
non-substance that describes an "auto-constitutive stress."8 [**The
transness of Black feminism and the Blackness of trans feminism,** as it
were, marks a reverberatory tremor that pervades the rhythm of work done
in service to Black and trans feminism.]{.underline} The vibratory waves
of its stress **[is the fuzzy location in which "identity"
resides]{.underline}**, [unable to be placed or limned and rather **a
haptic disturbance**]{.underline}, a tenor, a worrying, a movement [that
is placed where it cannot be placed]{.underline}. So yes, [the centering
of Black "women"]{.underline} (again, this is a troubled term,
especially rubbing so close to the gender trouble that is Blackness) in
conversations surrounding feminism and the operative gender category of
"woman" [was in many ways meant to critique that very
term]{.underline}---to whom it actually refers in our imaginary, to what
and whose ends is the term deployed, in what situations is the term
deployed. "\[T\]he 'Black woman,'" L.H. Stallings writes in Mutha' Is
Half a Word, a phenomenal examination of the "unnaming" processes of
Black women, radical Black female sexuality, and Black queer desires,
"represents an invented character by cultures not of her own making ...
the term unsuccessfully attempts to join the narratives of woman (white)
with that of Black (man)."9 [In critiquing the notions of "Black" and
specifically]{.underline}, initially ["woman," Black women]{.underline},
in effect, [put a pressure on it that]{.underline} questioned its very
nominal and social status and [sought to alter the very foundations and
assumptions upon which the racially solipsistic category of "woman"
rested]{.underline}. You touch on something really important: [the
simultaneous urge to disrupt and change these limited and limiting
categories we use to identify ourselves, and to hold them close to
us]{.underline} [because it is by virtue of these categories that we
exist as subjects;]{.underline} **[we are subjectivated by these
categories, so to do away with them entirely would be to feel as though
we have lost ourselves.]{.underline}** But I sometimes wonder if this is
the aim, to lose ourselves, to cultivate liveable space in the losing of
ourselves. [Might the nexus of Black feminism and trans feminism be an
enabling provocation for un/racial, un/gendered "thought and existence
otherwise, an otherwise than being,"]{.underline} a shadethrowing
deployable problem for thought that names a force rather than physical
characteristic?10 Could that be a place to live? This is a genuine and
open question that I really want to invite to be interrogated.

#### Black women are ungendering the nexus of Black and woman, meaning that Black woman describes a set of disruptions rather than a bodily occurrence -- thus the aff opens space for new forms of becoming that hold out for impossible possibilities to be and live otherwise.

[[Black women]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[incite the rethinking
of un/gendering through a thoroughgoing interrogation of the processual
becoming (un)human through the subject placed at the nexus of Black and
woman]{.underline}]{.mark}. If "the Black woman" is, contentiously
speaking, an impossible figure, there is a curious kind of
becoming-Black-woman that is not only "read as a twin refusal (of both
purity and subjection)," but more pointedly an evil twin refusal, a
refusal of purification and subjectification.10 Or better yet, a
becoming-[[Blackwoman]{.underline}]{.mark} could be what Spillers has
called, at the literal outset of her seminal text, "a marked woman." The
marked woman: a figure who [[needs no introduction; or, a figure who,
perhaps, cannot be introduced, as the marked woman]{.underline}]{.mark}
is a pervasive, haunting presence of modernity, conditioning modernity's
possibility. Spillers is referencing herself and more broadly the nexus
of Black and woman. I want to maintain the troublesomeness of the
"marked woman," the words serving as indices for the disruption of
un/gendered subjects proximal to Blackness. The "problem for thought,"
the marked woman is a figured figure: not merely, or even at all, a
[[figure that exists as such and unmediated in sociality, but a figure
that is figured]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is to say an assemblage
fashioned to affix to and as subjectivity. To say that the marked woman
is the quintessential "problem for thought" is to think about not
solely, or even primarily, an actually occurring subject. The marked
woman describes not a subject in the world but a disruption that is
corporealized, discursive, and created; [[they]{.underline}]{.mark}11
[[describe a set of disruptions rather than a bodily
occurrence]{.underline}]{.mark} or Ellisonian "matter of a bio-chemical
accident to \[the\] epidermis." Insofar as the marked woman can be
linked to un/gendered fugitivity, they name a deployable disruption of
normativity. They name an inhibition of traniflesh. If the figured
figure of the marked woman is mired in a veritable un/gendered
Blackness, where are we to locate them in the world? [[Black women's
bodies serve]{.underline}]{.mark} here less [[as exemplar
representations of racialized cis womanhood's
discontents]{.underline}]{.mark}---which itself is a troubled and
fractured terminological rendering on the grounds that [[Black women
have long been withheld from "womanhood" and its constitutive
cisness---and instead as an excessive figuration that retains the
possibility of an otherwise ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}, an ontology
[[that refuses the logistical machineries of racial capitalism, gender
normativity, settler colonialism, and other hegemonic
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}. So I will grudgingly concede that "the
Black," inasmuch as such terminology references Blackness (and, to my
mind, that terminology does not capture Blackness, understood in pre
ontological distinction from ontic "Blacks"),12 is non-being, an
ontology. But to put a finer point on this: this non-being is, in fact,
not an incapacity or absolute abjection and subjection to being defined
by legacies of white supremacy; rather, this non-being is a becoming
that torques the very texture of how we come to exist and opens up
existence to the primary avenue of non-recognition. That is, instead of
existence naming a recognition and addressability based on norms imposed
from without, un/gendered fugitivity, traniflesh, gives existence over
to how we relate to one another on self-determinative, opaque, and
otherwise terms. It is a demand to give primacy to an ever-capacious
unfolding will to become something else. To become someone elsewhere,
somewhere else one; to become in and as and through traniflesh,
fugitivity un/gendered. [[To inhabit the fugitive spirit of this
un/gendering is to incite a radically different way of
living]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a secretive and shadowy force that
presents new conditions of possibility for possibility. In this sense it
lays bare Spillers' argument that Blackness comes to be figured "as
subject possibility"; it lays bare, and operationalizes, how [[the
fugitive spirit of un/gendering points primarily to "a place where being
undone is simultaneously a space for new forms of
becoming]{.underline}]{.mark}." 13 As possibility for subjectivity,
[[un/gendered fugitivity's tran flesh holds out for impossible
possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, shadow possibilities, and thus
unanticipated possibilities that do not necessarily rely on normative
frameworks for their somethingness. In differentiating from
somethingness, a somethingness beholden to logics and optics of
legibility, fugitive un/gendering might present that which we dare not
know will come. ∼ On the increasingly intellectual space of Facebook,
one can find, if one knows where to look (or who to subscribe to),
gender gems. Che Gossett, on June 10, 2017, posted as a status: "trans
as being on the run from gender ... trans as gender's undercommons." 14
And my mind set sail. Yes, trans is on the run from gender, [[gender
understood particularly as that material and]{.underline}]{.mark}
(white) [[symbolic regime of binaristic
categorization]{.underline}]{.mark}. If gender is at least one
substantive node of legalizing oneself as a subject, trans articulates a
self-effacement inasmuch as one's "self" operates upon a fundamental
cohesiveness of which an intact/integral gender is constitutive.
Moseying along in the undercommons, [[trans refuses to be known ahead of
itself, slurring subjective embodiment and blurring subjective
transparency.]{.underline}]{.mark} Trans emerges through its otherwise
to be knownness, its runnin' of its mouf, its lay-low dissemblance.
Effacing the subject it is believed to be stemming from is a fugitive
move away from subjectivity toward subjectivity, a beneath, an
underground, a subversive simmering subterrain where we ain't got no
business doing\' none of yo' business. I feelz you, Nate: I, too,
"confess to a weakness for these amphibious, in-between, both/and
advances into a realm which defies categorization, this way of
trespassing, so to speak, the line which otherwise divides ... "15
Amphibiousness is transness, interstitial and defiant of categorization.
Where it goes, it trespasses; where it leaves, it tears ever so
slightly. In the tearing might be where traniflesh emerges. Inasmuch as
traniflesh has been gifted by Green's and Ellison's tranifest---and it
has been gifted a great deal, an insurmountable debt that is not a
debt---it harbors a profound sense of hope fomented by a Black feminist
genealogy. It is life in the "dissonance" [[Black feminism has made a
quotidian practice, making love and queer futures]{.underline}]{.mark},
effusively.16 That quotidian practice looks to worry and trouble the
lines. The traniflesh that un/gendered fugitivity and fugitive
un/gendering reference upsets the end game, as it were, of linear
frameworks that demand answers by partitioning, and instead refuses an
answer, remains open and, perhaps with a little groove and pep, dances
along the edges. Gettin' funky, the movement here challenges foreseeable
loci that attempt to pin down (one cannot say where something dances as
the dancing is always between places) and, in fact, allows insight into
unlocatable movement as a manner of living. But further, this is not a
dancing that is in opposition to stance; it is a dance that does not
know stance, does not register stance as stillness, because its dancing
is where it stands: standing in movement. Unhappy with "positions," the
work done here is unsure of the utility of positionality as
positionality maintains the legitimacy of scripted positions. Positions,
though increasingly useful in times in which one's given position
dictates so much, are nonetheless given by hegemonic powers, powers that
fugitivity and un/gendering ultimately wish to displace. What is
advocated, then, is entering in and out, a maddened stepping that plays
with multiplicity and subversion. In other words, ain't no half-steppin'
here; if you gon' step, then step. The movement is valorized because
[[there is always more room in movement, always more breath space, a
substance vitally needed for those to whom breath is absolutely sacred
due to its scarcity.]{.underline}]{.mark} There must always be a time in
which the instability of structures comes into bold relief, in which
instance they must be parted from. Structures always show their unstable
colors, so it is therefore necessary to demand a kind of living
unstructured, a living on the move as living as such inasmuch as being
structured and fixed disallows life to proliferate. To situate into a
position is to disallow meaning to erupt from the dance, to stultify the
life occurring. But even more, the dancing, the movement of the
un/gendered, is also an invitation to dance differently in apposition
to, say, race and gender as biologically determined. [[I want to claim
fugitive un/ gendering as a means by which we refuse formalized
stability, by which we differ and defer locatedness, and find the shape
of subjectivity in the shake of subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}.17

#### The refusal to be who one is said to be -- to become otherwise -- is mired in the Blackness of transness and the transness of Blackness. Fugitive ungendering violates normative gender regimes and their imposed antiblackness by positing Blackness and transness as on the run from recognition.

Blackness and transness, and their constitutive queerness, as analytic
modalities ---skirting and tangentially related to known congealed
"identities"---are projects for world transformation. These projects
concern [[radical work that interrogates varying
identity]{.underline}]{.mark} vectors and aims not merely for their
hegemonic destruction or a nebulous unspecificity but a kind [[of
sociality in the troublesome terrain of becoming
undone]{.underline}]{.mark} with and through one another. We don't know
where we'll end up, or if we'll end up anywhere, but that
feeling-with---that feeling of dissonance when you're shy about the fact
that now we "goin' together," as my aunties might say---is the onset of
a different way of doing ourselves in coalitional relation. [[We must be
working toward the underthrow of the world, thinking and living in
excess of our present condition because the radical
knows]{.underline}]{.mark}, and must believe, quite sincerely, [[that
things are not wholly contingent upon the context in which they were
sired]{.underline}]{.mark}. The structures under which we live posit
themselves as immutable and unable to be superseded, but if we imbibe
the nutritious nectar of Sweet Honey in the Rock we come to learn that
there is a way to supersede it, to get "outa," not out of, this no
way---and it is through a kind of flesh that we get "outa." This flesh
that has gotten out is what I want to delineate. [[It is the refusal to
be the way we are said to be]{.underline}]{.mark}, a coalitional refusal
marked by "ensemble's para ontological insurgency" [[that does not
straighten, does not disentangle, and does not cohere, all in the name
of an "ungendered plurality.]{.underline}]{.mark}"1 The irruptive work
of Blackness's proximity to trans/gender puts into relief that
[[Blackness and transness are, in the first instance, "political
move\[s\], strategic or tactical move\[s\]]{.underline}]{.mark} ...
movement itself, a displacement between established plateaus ... "2
Black and trans reference movement and cultivate space to live, to
become-as-being, in this movement. [[They reference the process by which
gender is unmoored and unmade as an otherwise way to become a subject in
excess of gender]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we become, both in
unanticipated ways and in ways imposed upon us, [[in addition to ways we
self-determine,]{.underline}]{.mark} there is a displaced and ethereal
movement within us that yearns to breach the bounds of this body that
has been made without our consent. [[Being touched by Blackness and
transness]{.underline}]{.mark} (and they can touch anyone, anywhere,
whenever) [[incites a radically divergent otherwise mode of becoming a
subject, so we come to "be" somewhere different where "being" is
something different.]{.underline}]{.mark} It's the lush fallout of the
touching and being touched: a volatile "viscera that ruptures the
apparent surface," as Rizvana Bradley describes hapticality.3 In this
radical divergence that one, anyone, moves toward ---[[where one
disperses themselves outside the constraints of normative (gendered)
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}---is the processual space in which
gender-that-is-not-gender manifests. A meditation on "ungendering" is of
course indebted to Hortense Spillers, and constituted by an inveterate
Black feminism. [[Gender is that which is made to attach to bodies of a
domesticized space]{.underline}]{.mark}, predicated on the integrity of
an ontology constituted by a white symbolic order. The subjects
contained in the "lab" of the ship's hold, as malleable flesh,
[[ungender subjectivity by way of refusing and being refused by the
necessary symbolic ontology of gender]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
context of Spillers' other remarks, particularly regarding Blackness's
unfixation from physiognomy, [ungendering might be understood usefully
as a refusal of an "identity," and furthermore of a forced
ontology]{.underline}. Ungendering's undercurrent of Blackness, a
radically feminist Blackness, mobilizes the flesh. To live in the flesh
is not, on my reading, to simply occupy an excoriated, captive
abjection; flesh does not strike me as primarily that which is engulfed
in an ontological state of violation, despite its subjection to searing
and being ripped apart, as Spillers notes. Or, at least not the flesh
with which I am concerned in this essay. [[Flesh is advanced here as an
inexhaustible agility that evades capture and in fact names the constant
eradication of oppressive apparatuses.]{.underline}]{.mark} Moving with
flesh is a generative abolition of normative regimes insofar as it, and
more specifically what I call below [[traniflesh, enacts a subjectivity
that definitionally instantiates the impossibility of (gendered)
normativity.]{.underline}]{.mark} And this, reader, might be a fugitive
un/gendering. (Of note: the slash in un/ gendering marks a necessary
slight departure from Spillers by drawing readers' attention to the
liberatory, uncapturable otherwise of flesh, of traniflesh.
[[Un/gendering's fleshiness is an overflow that spills over violent
categorization and]{.underline}]{.mark}, instead of being generated by
whips and frisks, [[is the unwhippable and unfriskable displacement of
normative violence]{.underline}]{.mark}.) A fugitive un/gendering can be
consolidated into what I want to call, bringing together Spillers, Kai
M. Green, and Treva Ellison: traniflesh. Spillers understands [[flesh as
distinct from the body, the body as embedded in captivity]{.mark} and
flesh as an antecedent "liberated subject-position"]{.underline} that
Alexander Weheliye describes as "nothing less than the ethereal social
(after) life of bare existence." Green and Ellison, in turn, describe
"tranifest"---transformative manifesting---as modalities that
"operat\[e\] across normativizing and violative configurations of race,
gender, class, sex, and sexuality," mobilizing across apparatuses
designed by the state.4 The spirit of these two theorizations is what I
want to put forth in traniflesh. Quintessential to traniflesh is an
[immaterial materiality; a kind of material displacement that lingers in
the vastness and fastness of the flesh, in resentful excess of the
"merely" biological.]{.underline} [[There is an urgent need to
conceptualize an alternative and otherwise mode of living grounded in a
non-exclusionary sociality that escapes captive and captivating logics
of subjectivity. A fugitive un/gendering attempts to vitiate the regime
of gender by way of an unyielding, radically opening
ungendering.]{.underline}]{.mark} We do this through the flesh, through
trans flesh---traniflesh, flesh that throws shade on gender, that erupts
into and out of the force of Blackness, the subversive interrogative
force of Black feminism, and the exuberant that-ness of trans. And that,
with all its [[Black and trans impossibility, provides an impossible
route out of the impossibility of routes]{.underline}]{.mark}.5 This
flesh is a kind of being that refuses being in favor of, or in
apposition to, becoming away from being as being. Traniflesh, then, does
not index matter or form but a general sentient sensorium that exceeds
corporeal capture and is the inaugurative muck that produces
unanticipated relational affinities. Traniflesh intensifies the haptic
and tactile---it's hac (k)tile, in all its connotative touch and
subversive infiltration---and challenges grammar through dehiscence and
fission, [[always coming apart in service of coming together
differently]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moving toward an unsettled
inhabitation of traniflesh is an inhibition that would lead to a transed
subjectivity, a non-normative way of living in, or even beside, oneself.
This is flesh that opposes the systematicity of bodies, which renders
subjects subjugable to the violence of the Law. My articulation of
traniflesh denotes a decidedly un/gendered anti-terrain,
"transorient\[ing\] sex and gender," as C. Riley Snorton provocatively
and poignantly maintains.6 Indeed, flesh is the
gendered-sitethat-is-not-a-gendered-site which welcomes those who were
expunged from traditional symbolics of gender, but also, to advance
Spillers a bit, those who move toward and engage the sociality of the
transgressive posture of fleshiness, engendering a different way of
becoming as that which might have come but for Gender. This "moving
toward" traniflesh indexes what Treva Ellison calls flesh "werq." Werqin
is how we move toward traniflesh, a [[werqing that is understood as a
"performance and praxis of existence that exceed\[s\] the commonsense of
normative categories]{.underline}]{.mark} of social being like gender,
race, class, and sexuality," a surplus and repurposing of the nodes of
our subjectivities.7 Moving toward operates through the [[fugitive
un/gendering occurring here via Black female flesh on the run from
gender, on the run from legibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, by way of a
kind of stepping out of a lineage, worrying the line as it were. The
stepping out of line, the getting out of line, that occurs when one
uptakes fleshiness and its fugitivity ruptures captivity and the social
death it purports to make natural---[[Black flesh's fugitivity is the
onset of a livable life beyond what has qualified as
being]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps it might be necessary, with this
theorization, to distinguish ever so nimbly traniflesh from Spillers'
"hieroglyphic" theorization of flesh. Whereas Spillers links flesh's
activation to violence and criminal wounding, traniflesh, as noted at
the outset of this essay, denotes the getting outa, which should be
construed as an circumscribable evasion of the interpellative call to
violated subjectivity. [[Traniflesh is]{.underline}]{.mark} that which
gets outa Spillersian flesh---[[the excess of the violence, the refusal
of being inaugurated via violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is where we
live otherwise outta the necessary violence of eligibilities imposed.
[[Traniflesh emerges as an impossibly possible space where we know not
what will arise because it does not rely on normative
frameworks.]{.underline}]{.mark} As an emergent force and "capacitating
structure for alternative modes of being," traniflesh [[offers different
formations and matterings, different and differing subjectivities, of
material and symbolic life]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 Traniflesh is an
otherwise way of being that exceeds the categorizing logics of race and
gender, that exceeds "identities" and (dis)organizes around subversive
world-building. It is fluid, excessive, a kind of primordial
transitivity that indexes Blackness, Black feminism, and
transness---citing Kimberly Benston's "beginning-as-blackness,"
"primordial blackness";Claire Colebrook's "transitivity"; Kai M. Green's
Blackness in excess of the category of Black; and Spillers' femininity
that evades definition because of its shadowy ubiquity. Traniflesh and
its flitting, flickering inhabitation is a rigorous commitment to
Green's and Ellison's "flexible new collectivities" that, on my reading,
do not conform to the mechanistic templates we understand as legible
identities: race, gender, sex, sexuality. [[It renames and reconfigures
how we become, and continue becoming,]{.underline}]{.mark} subjects that
breach hegemonic logics; traniflesh names that breach, names it as a
place to dwell and, more importantly, fashions another way of
living---indeed, a way that too many of us who are not permitted to live
simply can. [[Gender as a regime cannot do what it purports to do:
control and discipline.]{.underline}]{.mark} The supremacies of
whiteness, cisness, or maleness (and their various imbrications) are
perennially troubled by their leakages. Always is there something that
escapes, something that can't be caught, and these are the instances
that are fertile for making life here. My insistent belief in the impact
of these fleeting instances sometimes presents itself as timid
insecurity, as it seems that such belief is naïve considering the
pervasive oppressiveness that betides Black and trans life. And yet I
still, with the ardor of the Black womenfolk who raised me, believe in
those miniscule moments that give us that sinister grin of persistence.
I love that grin because I see it now as a small flash of being taken
over by the fugitive spirit, of dipping one's toe in traniflesh.
Traniflesh illegible, traniflesh outside this body, traniflesh and lose
yourself beside yourself. Gender won't control you there. [[Traniflesh
is the space that opens up amid gender
disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark}---a habitable space begat by
rupture---and, though difficult to go there for some, stretches out its
arms to let us live finally. I want to get too close to see, so close
you gotta feel through someone elsewhere or somewhere else one has never
one. We arrive together in continuous dislocation. These arrivals
constitute a field---a field of consent---where we consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, and [[consent not to be a single being through
our completely unreasonable entanglement of need and
enjoyment,]{.underline}]{.mark} our joy of missing out, of planning
without splaining. ... What is laid bare in the ungendering of gender
that Hortense Spillers describes is the specifically speculative fiction
and fraction of co-sent---an open field sequestered, a color field
abstracted. To never arrive alone, to render incomplete, to go home, to
never go home, to go back while moving forward in time, is to stick and
move, to strand without landing, in recess doubled down in struggle and
held by all those stranded.9 What if a feeling through another
elsewhere, or Park McArthur's and Constantina Zavitsanos' feeling
through somewhere else one, is a feeling in and as and through
traniflesh? Traniflesh is a visceral vocabulary enlivened through the
fugitive breakdown of gender. Even as one might be enclosed by the
prohibitions of other grammars, [[traniflesh acts as the unpunctuated
and anagrammatical]{.underline}]{.mark} (per Christina Sharpe)
[[subjectivity in which we can escape.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## Method Extension -- Subjugated Knowledges

#### Only through embracing subjugated knowledge and illicit social practices are we able to resist oppressive IR theory and undermine structural violence.

Critical agency and resistance In order not to be seen as an exercise of
disciplinary power---and as more critical theorizing in IR has long
recognized (Cox, 1981; Held, 1980)---[[IR needs a theory of resistance
if it is]{.mark} [to overcome its current]{.mark} methodological and
ethical crisis over its conceptual and epistemic approaches and their
liberal and bureaucratic biases]{.underline}.1 As with the discovery
that anthropology was once a colonially constructed discipline in the
employ of colonial governance (Asad, 1973), [IR is shaped by the power
structures it is embedded in (i.e. the 'international community', the
developed north, [conceptions of the liberal/neoliberal state]{.mark},
international organization, its norms and law, [and the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}). **[So far there has been little space for
an understanding of the potential legitimacy of resistance, which has
troubling implications.]{.underline}** It might be said that variants of
liberalism, pluralism, normative theory and constructivism represent
theoretical resistance to variants of realism. [However, [they]{.mark}
also [accept the inevitability of structural power over discourses,
social practices, norms and contingency]{.mark}. Such theories offer an
immanent critique which may ultimately be compliant with, rather than
resistant to, power, whether power is represented by military force,
material capacity or normative superiority]{.underline}. Critical and
post-structural theories may represent more radical resistance not
merely on theoretical grounds, but also in methodological and epistemic
terms (Agathangelou and Ling, 2004; Foucault 1984 \[1976\]). However,
[the insight that power always entails resistance and such critical
agency can be constructive not just negative and may carry its own
legitimacy has not yet been fully engaged with.]{.underline} The path
these dynamics indicate diverges: to criticize within the mainstream
paradigms in order to renew governmentality via a broader universalism
(or via 'securitization'); or [the discovery and adoption of new sites
of knowledge that are more contextually representative where
agency]{.underline} (or in Foucaultian terms, 'techniques of the self')
[can prosper]{.underline} (Foucault, 1999: 162). Of course these sites
are not new, but merely shielded from mainstream theories' view by the
inherent bias against resistance. Resistance in either framework is not
as a revolutionary or nationalist form of violence against the liberal
good life for all, as Marxists or nationalists of various early
post-colonialist persuasions might have it (Cabral, 1979). [It is also
not about the exertion of power as realists of various persuasions
envisage, or in the gathering of a broad but thin agreement on norms,
values or discourses, as implied by liberalism, constructivism or
critical theory]{.underline} (Richmond, 2008). It may also not represent
public and mass socio-political mobilization, given the obvious danger
of recrimination. Instead it indicates that government or governance,
whether through power/structure, institutions and norm transfer, is a
'... versatile equilibrium, with complementarity and conflicts ...'
(Foucault, 1999: 162). Power shapes, and the subject also acts within
its field---or possibly beyond (Foucault, 1983: 221). Such a Foucaultian
notion of resistance has very significant implications[. Foucault's
early work identified the subtleties of power and the ways in which
governance came to represent governmentality.]{.underline} It was often
criticized for allowing for little resistance, such was the perceived
disciplinary effectiveness and reach of governmentality. It was also
argued that as he had not explained a clear normative project (or
critique) the motivations of resistance where unclear, thus leading
agency into a paralysis. Worse, it is argued that he was complicit with
'dubious' forms of resistance, including revolutionary violence
(Habermas, 1987; Pickett, 1996: 445--7). This is a mistaken view.
[[Foucault's]{.mark} entire [project of resistance]{.mark}]{.underline},
which spanned much of his career, [[sought to identify]{.mark} and
understand [the effects of power]{.mark} and then later [to
prevent]{.mark} contestation, transgression, struggle and [resistance
from being co-opted into power]{.mark} itself.]{.underline} Resistance
is always possible, little understood, and should not result in new
patterns or institutions of exclusion according to this phase (Foucault,
in Pickett, 1996: 450). For this reason, [resistance should be allied to
a desire not to create new orders or metanarratives, but instead aimed
towards local forms of agency and their international
effects.]{.underline} Later Foucault shifted away from discourses of
power towards social practices of resistance that were in some way
related to power[**. He thought that epistemological understandings of
[resistance should arise from]{.mark} an [engagement with social
practices]{.mark} of resistance, meaning [from subjugated
knowledge]{.mark}**[. This uncovers the technologies of power,
including]{.mark} hierarchies and [structural]{.mark} forms of
[violence]{.mark}, which are unfortunately reinstalled in every
institutional evolution of mainstream, problem-solving theory and
policy]{.underline}. Genealogical method and an interrogation of
institutions, the economy, ideology (including Marxism), was in
discursive and practical terms to disrupt or unsettle power through both
agitation and critique (of an ideological nature) (Foucault, 1980:
151--4). However, power itself often becomes hidden in order to avoid
provoking resistance. [Yet inevitably, power fails to hide completely
because it is hierarchical, unequal and requires material mobilization.
**[Subjugated knowledge is diffuse and]{.mark} eventually [leads to a
framework for politics without hierarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
representative of a variety of resistances. It would be egalitarian and
there would be '... a radical pluralism bordering on anarchy' (Pickett,
1996: 456). [Thus, [resistance is not]{.mark} [merely an
antidote]{.mark} to power [but reconstitutes politics]{.mark} according
to those who express agency, however diffuse]{.underline}. **[The point
of resistance is [to elude power]{.mark} [rather than to
confront]{.mark} it head on---a form of 'strategic
knowledge']{.underline}** (Foucault, 1979: 219, 1980: 145, 1984
\[1976\]: 95). Resistance to a theory, state or policy for not meeting
its own normative or technical standards may not necessarily represent
critical agency, in that it merely holds power up to its own standards
which are already biased in favour of the hegemon (Foucault, 1984
\[1976\]: 107--8). [Transformation requires overcoming disciplinary
power rather than accepting its shaping of the subject]{.underline} (a
form of biopower) even if it does so via discourses of rights,
institutions or governance. Such meta-narratives on a global scale
inevitably follow elite consensus or the subtleties of hidden (meaning
subtle) power that the structures which have emerged over history
construct to maintain themselves. As a result, [for Foucault, a 'daily
ethico-political struggle' ensues to create the conditions in which
resistance can emerge in opposition to domination]{.underline}. New
forms of subjectivity can emerge aimed at autonomy and equality (these
are liberal objectives, even though Foucault was critical of
liberalism's attempts at normalizing and domination) (Pickett, 1996:
463). [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} illustrates how Foucault, with his
later reference to agonism as a process whereby new forms of
subjectivity might emerge though a tense struggle with power, [[was
constructing the grounds for a reconceptualization of agency]{.mark},
legitimacy and of peace.]{.underline} This represents a post-liberal
peace, where the local and the liberal interact creating hybrid
processes and outcomes through the social practices and discourses
associated with both compliance with liberal peace frameworks and
resistance, representing a critical agency (Richmond, 2011). [This
argument does not refer to violent resistance]{.underline} (which
Foucault may have indeed tolerated in some instances) [or even
necessarily to notions of civil resistance]{.underline} (which carries a
whole set of implications about how 'civil' is defined by limitations
set by power on acceptable forms of resistance) (Randle, 1994: 198;
Roberts and Ash, 2009). Passive resistance also implies that agency can
only really be exerted politically through public mobilization on a
large scale. **[What is more significant is the [agency that]{.mark}
[emerges from forms of hidden, everyday]{.mark} forms of [resistance,
and their circulation and engagements with power]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
a discussion which has been most recently developed in the work of Scott
(drawing on Foucault) (Foucault, 1997, 2009; Pickett, 1996; Scott, 1990,
2009[). They are hidden because [they operate in a different register to
that which can be seen in]{.mark} [formal theory and methodologies,
representing]{.mark} social, political, economic and cultural
[agency]{.mark} and capacity [of diffuse]{.mark} and disaggregated
[networks of actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (bearing in mind Latour's
critical comments about how power constructs actors and groups in such a
way as to make them malleable to power and its related disciplinary
analysis) (Latour, 2005: 29). Different theoretical and methodological
frameworks---from sociology, anthropology for example---present
different pictures and agency when compared to IR's rejection of
resistance. This agency represents a form of 'dark matter'---a term
describing the 'missing' matter only recently discovered which makes up
a substantial majority of the physical universe. [In the light of
Foucault's contribution, in IR this may indicate grass roots
agency---and the most numerous of actors---disguised from the eyes of
power and its structures, not coordinated or mobilized on a large scale,
nor violent, but aimed at peaceful change and
transformation]{.underline}. Such agency can be seen in a discursive
manner, as a form of critical agency**[. [It acts in a fragmented and
atomized]{.mark}, but [large scale,]{.mark} way [to]{.mark} [disrupt
power where it does not represent current]{.mark} and localized
legitimacy or [consensi]{.mark} and its engagement with, or construction
of, the international.]{.underline}** It is formative of IR yet it has
hardly been addressed by its dominant theories. Since the collapse of
socialism as a theory for human emancipation it has been difficult to
talk about agency, resistance, radical improvements in welfare, because
of its ideological baggage and allusions to national liberation. This
has made it difficult to debate about liberalism and neo-liberalism
without seeming to be retrogressive (especially in North America)
(Rorty, 1998: 228). Social forms of democracy as a legitimate part of IR
and its approach to peace have almost become that 'which dare not speak
its name', in the face of the neo-liberal state and global economy now
so dominant a partner for democracy.2 Rorty's solution to this vacuum of
debate is to shift the discussion from solidarity and emancipation
versus the bourgeoisie to greed and selfishness. This can be juxtaposed
to the conditions of the everyday required for peace in an emancipatory
form, indicating empathy, rights, needs, welfare, culture, custom,
identity and justice (Richmond, 2008). The resistant agencies that have
been directed at the universalizing and reductionist excesses of liberal
internationalism, institutionalism and neo-liberal zeal are often
focused on forms of social democracy, rights, identity, needs and
justice, but with a far broader-reaching inclusiveness of contextual
frameworks and identities than Western rationalism or liberalism allows
for, while borrowing from both. This potentially represents more than
the bourgeoisie social democracies that Rorty regrets may be the
inevitable outcome of this process (2005: 229). It would be hybrid and
far more mixed that the old terminology of a 'mixed mode' (i.e. mainly
economic) suggests. [[It would be]{.mark} politically, socially and
culturally [hybrid]{.mark}, and [in a way that transcends mimicry and
hegemon]{.mark}y. It will not emerge because of only the benevolence of
elites, but because of the capacity of its subjects and their
aspirations]{.underline}. Indeed, such hidden capacity and resistant
agency may well represent the dark matter of IR---a massive percentage
of the scale of all capacity for reform, development, justice,
institutions, civil society, rights, needs, peace and emancipation. [It
represents a silent majority (]{.underline}Baudrillard, 1983; Scott,
1985, 1990). Resistant and critical agencies play a major role in
shaping security, institutions and states, and in innovation for new
forms of peace. [[Resistance is the essence of such critical
agency]{.mark}. This is inconvenient for compliance oriented theory,
methods and praxis]{.underline} (Appadurai, 1996) [because critical
agency is aimed at transformation and emancipation, but maintains
alterity rather than homogeneity]{.underline} (Blaney and Inayatullah,
2002). [[It necessitates an engagement with the very salient
resistances]{.mark} that have been [mounted against IR's mainstream
methods]{.mark} and variety of political and economic debates and
institutions]{.underline} (Randle, 1994; Roberts and Ash, 2009).

## IMPACT -- SETTLER COLONIALISM

#### The concept of a nuclear family is fundamental to the colonial order -- legal, social, and cultural practices conspire to make the family an adaptable and formidable social institution to enhance colonial hegemony

**Phillips 9** \[Richard Phillips, Department of Geography, University
of Liverpool, Liverpool, "Settler colonialism and the nuclear family,"
*The Canadian Geographer,* 6/1/2009\] sg

[**Colonial societies revolved around nuclear families**.]{.underline}
Colonists did not stand equally before the law or the state: [only
certain relationships were recognized as marriage]{.underline}, [only
certain groupings as families]{.underline} and only these [were accorded
the rights and privileges that went with family membership]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} rights and [privileges were fundamental to the
colonial order,]{.underline} [conferring social status and also material
wealth]{.underline}. The hegemony of the heterosexual nuclear family was
most pronounced in agricultural colonies that adopted the family farm as
the building block for settlement (Harris 1977). There, it might have
seemed that colonialism needed families, as its units of production and
consumption. Arguably, however, agricultural settlement needed families
less than families needed farms, and family farms were often poorly
adapted to the new environments. Certainly, the story of the
agricultural colonization of South Australia, presented in Don Meinig's
classic tragedy, The Margins of the Good Earth (1963), is one of
families awkwardly inhabiting and in many cases being defeated by an
area better suited to cowboys, wine growers and Aborigines. [**The
colonial family, though broadly hegemonic, was
differentiated**.]{.underline} The form and importance of families
varied both between and within colonies. This paper has illustrated how
even the most closely related colonies---such as New South Wales and
South Australia or Ontario---regulated marriage and sexuality
differently. Within jurisdictions, the same was true. Informal 'country
marriages', as their name suggests, tended to be tolerated in some areas
more than others, while other regulatory systems such as the Contagious
Diseases Acts and Ordinances had their own intra-colonial geographies.
The differentiated historical geography of colonial families can be
explained, in part, with reference to 'big picture' histories of family,
sexuality and imperialism. The families that resettled in Saskatchewan
or Western Australia in the last decades of the nineteenth century were
different, in degree if not in kind, from their earlier counterparts in
the Cape Colony or New England, and this was because the world had moved
on in the intervening years. The systems that underpinned the family and
regulated non-familial sexualities had changed, with innovations in one
place setting precedents that were followed or adapted, sooner or later,
in others. Taking a longer view of these apparently eclectic
developments, Miles Ogborn (1998) argues that [the changing regulation
of sexuality moved with the unfolding historical]{.underline} [geography
of modernity.]{.underline} [It also moved with the historical geography
of imperialism]{.underline}, which was periodically restructured, for
example, through the introduction of self-government in selected British
colonies and the initiation of mass emigration/immigration schemes
during the middle decades of the nineteenth century. **[The colonial
nuclear family reflected]{.underline} [and adapted to these and other
changes, displaying flexibility that only enhanced its hegemonic
position]{.underline}.** [Differences between colonial family formations
can]{.underline} also [be attributed to more local circumstances and
agency]{.underline}. This paper has illustrated how farming communities
tended to be more family oriented than mining districts, ports, cities
or garrisons, where there were more single people, prostitutes and
same-sex liaisons and partnerships. Families were also more common in
established colonies, where sex ratios were relatively balanced, than
they were in male-dominated settlement frontiers. But colonists also
came to different decisions about the importance of family, and the
kinds of family they valued. This was partly a matter of their
backgrounds: of differences between English settlers in South Australia,
Scots in Ontario and emancipated Africans in Sierra Leone. But it also
reflected the choices they made in the new society. Colonial families
were produced and reproduced by colonists, both institutionally and
physically. Families may have been more portable than communities, but
their portability was complex and contested. As Edward Said argued,
ideas (in the broadest sense) do not travel intact but shift according
to 'conditions of acceptance or, as an inevitable part of acceptance,
resistances--- which then confronts the transplanted theory or idea,
making possible its introduction or toleration, however alien it might
appear to be' (Said 1984, p. 227). So, [while the nuclear family
travelled well]{.underline} [and assumed great significance in most
resettlement colonies]{.underline}, [it was also differentiated,
adaptable and flexible, constantly being reinvented]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} and within [particular colonial circumstances and
unfolding imperial histories]{.underline}. My argument that [colonial
nuclear families were produced in, rather than simply exported
to]{.underline}, [colonies]{.underline} resonates with the postcolonial
critique of what Blaut called the 'colonizer's model of the world': the
ultimate attribution of colonial cultural formations to ideas exported
from Europe, which 'seems like' the 'point of origin' (Said 1984, p.
227). Europe only seems like the origin because ideas are changed as
they travel and by the places they travel to. In Dipesh Chakrabarty's
terms, European ideas are 'provincialized'---their meanings renewed and
changed---in the nonEuropean world. [The nuclear family]{.underline},
[like]{.underline} other, sometimes [grander 'European']{.underline}
ideas and institutions including [conceptions of modernity]{.underline}
(Rabinow 1989, p. 289) and Europeanness itself (Stoler 2002, p. 16),
'[may be renewed from and for the margins']{.underline} (Chakrabarty
2000, p. 16). Ann Laura Stoler argues that broad swathes of ostensibly
European political, social, cultural and economic life were generated in
colonial spheres 'and only then brought "home" ' (Stoler 2002, p. 16).
This challenges us to think differently about colonial societies, but at
the same time it brings us back to Turner's insistence on the generative
possibilities of the frontier, and to Harris's on what might
metaphorically be seen as the unprecedented fertility of colonial soil.

#### Colonial world ordering exists within a frame of white racial kinship that naturalizes racial categories of identity into the lexicon of global governance.

Specifically, **[IR comes to resemble a colonial
household]{.underline}**. [Its singular, oppositional
perspective]{.underline} (\"I versus You\") [stakes out]{.underline} an
establishment of [\"civilization\" in a space that is
already]{.underline} crowded with local traditions of [thinking, doing,
and being]{.underline} [but proclaimed]{.underline}, in willful
arrogance, as [a \"state of nature\" plagued by fearful
\"anarchy\"]{.underline} and its murderous power politics. **[The House
seeks to stave off such \"disorder\" by imposing
\"order.\"]{.underline}** But the House does so by [appropriating the
knowledge, resources, and labor of racialized, sexualized
Others]{.underline} for its own benefit and pleasure [while announcing
itself the sole producer-the father-of our world]{.underline}. [**Others
qualify as \"**innocent\" children]{.underline}, [wards, or **servants
at best, or \"unteachable\" barbarians at worst**]{.underline}. In
either case, **[Others]{.underline} [must wait]{.underline}** faithfully
**[for]{.underline}** their [**admittance**, if ever, into the House of
IR.]{.underline} Directing Others with declarative statements, [the
House assumes that it knows both the problem (\"power\") and its
solution (\"more power\").]{.underline} [Such suffocation]{.underline}
of Self and Other [leaves a multigenerational legacy similar to the
actual colonial household\'s]{.underline}: that is, erasures and
violences that flip the household\'s original intent. [Order turns into
disorder]{.underline}, repulsion into desire, [purity into
hybridity]{.underline}. In [the House of IR,]{.underline} especially,
another practice [rules]{.underline}: [to treat power as
empire,]{.underline} regardless of public devastations or secret
indulgences. Poisies helps us to imagine a future beyond colonial
capitalist-patriarchy. We call our theoretical framework Worldism.2
Instead of detailing it upfront, we would like Worldism to emerge,
poitically, from our critical review of conventional IR. This approach
demonstrates why we need Worldism, where it fits, and how it comes
about. Nonetheless, we offer a preview here to give an idea of its
orientation. Worldism opens with poisies\' collective, relational
premise (\"you and me\"3). [Rooted in structural social
relations]{.underline} of production, [Worldism acknowledges the
existence of multiple worlds while registering]{.underline}, at the same
time, [their constant]{.underline}, mutual
\"[reverberation]{.underline}\" [and (re)construction]{.underline}. [In
contrast to the House of IR\'s obsessive fear of disorder]{.underline},
[Worldism aims to allow negotiation across difference in the building of
communities]{.underline}. Toward this end, Worldism asks: What is the
problem, according to whom, and why? [Only then can a solution arise
that will serve the greatest good]{.underline} for the greatest number.
Not a house but Gandhi\'s \"oceanic circle\" guides Worldism. Its
\"outermost circumference \[does\] not wield power to crush the inner
circle but give\[s\] strength to all within and derive its strength from
it\" (Ghandhi 1990:348). [Realizing our oceanic
connectedness]{.underline}, we may \"wake up from our personal and
collective delusions to realize who we are, where we are going, and how
we are living \[thereby preventing further violence through
reactionary\] crusades to rid the world of evil\" (Pigem 2002:10-11).
Table 1 compares these key features of Worldism with the House of IR.
Our argument proceeds in three parts. Part 1 identifies
[IR\'s]{.underline} foremost problematic: its [constitution of
boundaries]{.underline} that [fence off a majority of the
world]{.underline}. [Identifying IR as a colonial household highlights
its structural intimacy with capitalist-patriarchy]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} recognition [accounts for how this house has emerged
in world politics]{.underline} and what it means for unequal social
relations. Part 2 examines the consequences to colonizing IR as an
academic discipline, a source of knowledge production, and a field of
practical politics. We find that elite gestures toward \"fairness\" and
\"representation\" still collude with power ideologically,
institutionally, and practically. [International relation\'s colonial
desires surface when cracks in the system expose acts of racialized,
sexualized brutality by seemingly normal protectors of the status
quo,]{.underline} as seen recently at Abu Ghraib. Part 3 ends with
suggestions for transforming this outdated, (self-)destructive colonial
set-up for an emancipatory, democratic IR. IR Household Relations: In
and Out, Up and Down Our understanding of the colonial household comes
from Ann Laura Stoler (2002). Her study of colonial management in
Indonesia and Indochina under Dutch and French rule, respectively,
tracks their \"genealogies of the intimate.\" She asks: How do
[racialized categories of identity emerge and become naturalized into
the lexicon of colonial governance]{.underline}? Given the potent
politics of categorizing identities, Stoler (2002:8) examines \"the
histories of their making, the exclusions they enabled, and violences
they condoned\" (2002:8). Stoler notes, for example, a legal case in
French-controlled Indochina where a French father sought clemency for
his halfVietnamese son but was refused on the grounds of the son\'s
insufficient \"Frenchness.\" Yet other mixed-blood progeny were granted
European status if they could demonstrate due \"cultural competence,\"
such as feeling alienated when placed among \"natives.\" [The House of
IR exhibits a]{.underline} similar [politics of exclusion and
violence]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} clearly **[identifies who\'s
\"in,\" who\'s \"out,\" and who\'s precariously \"on the
border.\"]{.underline}** [It]{.underline} also [stratifies who\'s
\"upstairs\" and who\'s \"downstairs.\"]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
hierarchical division of space [reflects the house\'s participation
in]{.underline} and complicity with [material relations of production
and its uneven distribution of social wealth]{.underline}.4

## IMPACT -- PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

#### The landscape of property operates under a logic that incentivizes a constricted black female sexuality because the queerness of the black woman's sexuality produces chaos and dismantles the logic of ownership.

[[The Black matriarch head of household confounds and disorganizes the
gendered landscapes of settler colonialism. Black
women,]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer the property of slave owners as
technologies of plantation colonial settlement as land clearers and
producers of land clearers[[, become unintelligible to settler colonial
space making]{.underline}.]{.mark} Post emancipation, Black women are no
longer property that reproduce the settler colonial landscape[. [Black
women must be incorporated into other social formations off the
plantation that render them property again. The family is a social
formation that turns women into property.]{.mark} [The Moynihan Report
tries to impose the family onto the Black matriarch's household in order
to render women property and produce them as an intelligible form of
gender for settler colonial spatial practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Black matriarch resists this property making institution[. [The settler
colonial social and spatial order produces genders, sexualities and
family formations that produce property]{.mark}]{.underline}. Normative
gender, [[sexuality and family formations create a heteronormative
social and spatial order that is conducive to the production of
property.]{.mark} [Property is required to]{.mark}]{.underline} occupy
and formally own or [[settle]{.underline}]{.mark} a space according to
the terms of what Carole Pateman calls the settler contract.
Heteronormative gender relations produce and enable property in multiple
forms. [[Non heteronormative gender relations confound and prevent the
production and accumulation of property. Black matriarchs disorganize
and upset the settler colonial and heteronormative thrust toward the
production of property.]{.underline}]{.mark} The unruly female [[gender
of the Black matriarch no longer functions as property or produces more
property]{.underline}.]{.mark} The sexuality of the Black female unwed
matriarch is unrestrained Black female sexuality. Black [[female
sexuality that is not restrained and disciplined produces an
undisciplined and unruly Black surplus. The children of Black
matriarchs, as surplus populations, no longer function as property as
they did under enslavement.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not only do [[Black
women's children not function as or make property (clear plantation
lan]{.mark}d]{.underline}) they represent the antithesis of property
during the Black Power era. [[Black children of Black matriarchs are
anti-property as they will likely destroy it.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
Kerner Commission as well as other sociological studies produced during
the 1960s hypothesized that urban unrest was due to poor parenting on
the part of Black matriarchs. [[Black women's sexuality and reproduction
work outside of the normative linear progression]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the social and spatial orders that are oriented toward producing
property. I contend that the Moynihan Report reads [[Black female
sexuality as non-normative and anti-property.]{.underline}]{.mark} I
also argue that the [[Black matriarchs]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
Moynihan Report [[are queered along the lines of the in/ability to
create property which is crucial to the maintenance of the settler
colonial social and spatial order]{.underline}]{.mark}. Black matriarchs
are queer/ed in this historical moment because [[their gender and
sexuality work against the creation of property which I argue is also a
function of settler sexuality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Non-normative or
queer gender and sexuality for the purposes of this project run along
the axes of the logics and production of property. The [[biopolitical
management of Black populations,]{.underline}]{.mark} which should be
distinguished from other racialized populations for analytical
precision, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} wholly [[wrapped up in the
possibility of producing property in multiple
forms.]{.underline}]{.mark} Queerness or non normative gender and
sexuality within settler colonial states [[should also be analyzed
alongside of and within the logics of property. Normative settler gender
and sexuality make property---as people, commodities, land, and
possession of land---possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Property should be
understood as material, social, ideological, utopic and a site of
desire[. [Property is as much about the future as it is the
pas]{.mark}t.]{.underline} In fact, property at times conceals the past,
particularly the conditions of possibility that made it possible.
Property required the elimination of the Native people and enslavement
of Black people. I want to make sure that property is not understood as
inert in the context of this project. [[Property certainly represents a
visible landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, I would like to take up
the landscape of property as one that is always in, what Richard Schein
would say, the process of becoming. Property as a landscape (including
people) also functions as "discourse materialized."84 According to
Nicolas Blomley who provides a more Marxian account of its existence and
purpose, property is an enactment of power. The specific enactment of
power is the power to exclude.

## 2AC -- IR SUX

#### IR theory mystifies the coordinates of identity that shape it by naturalizing power relations. Only a theory of IR that examines imperialist segregation and land re/detetorialization is able to complicate and desegregate patterns of thought that colonize the world.

**Agathangelou and Turcotte 14** (Anna and Heather, PhD in Political
Science and PhD in Feminist Studies. "Postcolonial Theories and
Challenges to 'First World-ism'". Pages 47-55. //lilith)

More than a decade ago several [theorists called for an end to
neglecting imperialism in IR and for recognizing that knowledge and
representation is as important form of a power]{.underline} (Darby and
Paolini 1994) [in understanding world politics]{.underline}. Since then
many scholars have critiqued the provincial and Eurocentric aspects of
the discipline by drawing on postcolonial thinking and practices
(Krishna 1993; Barkawi and Laffey 2001; Ling 2002). This disruption of
the discipline's dominant epistemologies by critical theorists and
feminist scholars, and particularly Marxist and scholars of the Global
South (Chowdhry and Nair 2002) who centralized class-based politics and
regionality, prepared the ground for our critique by expanding the
theoretical and methodological terrains of IR. [These works not only
explore the interconnected relevance of gender, race, ethnicity,
sexuality, class, nationality and regionality but they also engage with
the ways in which knowledge production plays a signifi cant role in
shaping political praxis and the formation of colonial and imperial
projects]{.underline}. These works continue to play an imperative part
in constituting, founding and shaping the conditions of possibility
within global politics, as well as the representations of postcolonial
and Western identities. [Postcolonial critiques highlight that our
understandings of the international and the relations of identity
formations are limited]{.underline} (Rupert 1995; Ling 2002; Inayatullah
and Blaney 2004). Postcolonial theorizations have [highlighted the
signifi cance of international geographies by suggesting that the
constitution of geographical sites as social relations depends on
violence]{.underline} (Mudimbe 1994; Mama 1995; Mamdani 1996; Mbembe
2001). More specifi cally some IR scholars argue that [colonial
globalities' formations]{.underline} (Muppidi 2004) and constitutions,
one of which is the discipline of international relations, [depend on
violently segregating the world as a fundamental process]{.underline}
(Agathangelou 2006, forthcoming; Smith 2006; Rai 2007). [Geopolitical
segregation is a substantive set of imperial strategies that produce
distinct divisions and locales of world politics, including the
discipline and practice of IR (realist, neoliberalism, critical,
feminist, postcolonial). Often times it pits intellectual communities
against one another and locates them asymmetrically to each other within
'their own' cordoned off territory because of a scramble for resources,
claims to expertise and/or to merely legitimize positions of power
within an asymmetrical IR World Order]{.underline}.4 We consider such
segregation frameworks -- though useful maybe on a short-term basis --
as turning into strategies that become complicit with the desires and
even violent fantasies of imperialism (see also, Agathangelou and Ling
2009). Such frameworks feed imperial projects that consolidate global
space, feminist theory and subject formation 'anew' within the borders
of IR, which make capital's crossings and violations possible.
[Segregation is a logic and practice that regulates, elides and
spectacularizes bodies (people, land, knowledge) through gender, racial,
ethnic, sexual, national and global orders within the frameworks of IR,
albeit with many tensions and myriad contradictions]{.underline}.
Geopolitical segregation, then, is a means to solidify the conditions of
power that regulate, control and exploit bodies as central to imperial
reformations of political practice and knowledge formations. [The
subjects of IR and IR subjects themselves are negotiated through their
divided geographies of power within the discipline in the name of
projects that centralize profit and fear as their goals]{.underline}
(Agathangelou and Ling 2009). [The segregation and division of different
sites within IR mystifies their coconstitutive histories, unequal
divisions of labor and makes difficult the raising of questions about
its political praxes through the naturalization -- the canonization --
of IR, feminist theory and postcolonial world politics.]{.underline}
Therefore, [we suggest that it is crucial to consider geopolitical
bodies (the state, the physical bodies of individuals, regions,
knowledges) generally, and the geopolitical bodies of IR (scholars,
researchers, policy makers) more specifically, as constantly forming
through their struggles, flows, movements, migrations and 'transnational
connectivities']{.underline} (Grewal 2005). Through the description of
the multiple worlds that we occupy, the articulation of critical spatial
and temporal frames that make it possible for us to 'see' that the
knowledge and practice of 'global' politics are historically entangled
within an imperial project of geopolitical segregation is crucial. It
allows us to recognize that some are called to be complicit (i.e.
appropriating their struggle for justice to the struggle for more profi
ts and capital formation) and others to actively participate in
protecting the interests of First World-ism and its contingent
identified interests even with a high cost, privileged subjects
consequently impeding possibilities of transformative 'transnational'
and 'global' analyses and practices for a just feminist world. Much
debate and contestations of the approaches of hegemonic Anglo-American
feminist theorizations on the issues of sexual differentiation as
substantive factors of feminist experience, method, knowledge and
practice brought to the fore the significance of theorists' location as
well as the effect of this location on framing and articulating a
politics of disruption against imperial and colonizing practices.5 The
Anglo-American feminist response to such theorizations and critiques
manifested in 'new' modes of global feminism with claims of
attentiveness to different needs of feminism and feminist subjects
around the globe. However, Global Feminists' practices often redraw the
political boundaries of academic knowledge to secure whiteness and First
Worldism as structures of privilege within feminist and IR frameworks;
these feminist subjects were, in fact, feminist objects. Such theories
and practices continue to deepen the polarizations between different
modes and people who embody feminist work; it further generates imperial
feminist praxes that foreclose possibilities of solidarity.6 The
theories and methods of some First World Feminisms, women of color
feminisms, Third World feminisms, feminisms of the Global South and
transnational feminisms from varied geopolitical constituencies
articulate their opposition to gender essentialisms and the racial,
class and heteronormative privileging within international relations
through their own locations and oppositional histories to colonization's
and imperial knowledge formations and practice (see, for example, Spivak
1988; Grewal and Kaplan 1994; Imam 1997; Nnaemeka 2005). Yet, many of
these scholars and the knowledges produced with these critical
frameworks -- both from the Global South and the Global North7 -- are
relegated to the margins and asymmetrically located on the varied
knowledge matrices of the academy (see also Agathangelou and Ling 2002).
Disrupting segregation as a process and productive strategy of violence
that is fundamental to the formation of the international is thus,
crucial. Underlying much of world politics has been the violent division
of the world into domestic and international, the centre and the
periphery, the developed and the underdeveloped worlds, the masculine
from the feminine, the state territorial space from the anarchic and
violent world. Many of these segregations and divisions of the places
that people live and relate with on a daily basis have been detrimental
to our lives. Segregation has extensively contributed to experiences
with violation, and many times death, even when the international
discourses have been about change, development, and peace and world
order. Numerous scholars from the Global South have questioned the
relevance of Anglo-Saxon feminist ideas for women in the Third World
arguing that such theories presume a unified category of a 'poor woman
of the Third World' (Mohanty et al. 1991; Okeke 1996; Chang 2000; Rowley
2003) and argue that feminism itself is a bourgeois ideology of the
First World that privileges gender oppression and struggles against
patriarchy at the expense of many other structural struggles (Shohat
1998; Narayan and Harding 2000; Waller and Rycenga 2000). However, as
feminists from the First and Third World have engaged one another and
tensions have emerged, a move by some to understand gender, racial,
national and class-based violences and oppressions in specific, local
and historical contexts also has emerged in productive and contested
ways. As Mohanty (1991b) explains understanding feminism in only
gendered terms assumes that definitions and practices of identities of
'womanhood' are not connected to racial, class, nation or sexuality;
rather it is precisely these imbrications of identity that form the
ideologies of womanhood. Third World Feminism(s)'s critiques of First
World Feminism(s) embody within them two simultaneous deconstruction
projects: (1) First World feminism(s), while not a unified project, has
been built upon systemic underpinnings of imperialism; (2) Third World
Feminism(s), while not a unified project, has been built upon
anti-imperial connections. Drawing on these contradictions and tensions
in the formations of First and 'Other' Feminisms necessitates an
articulation of feminist projects grounded in the histories, cultures
and experiences of women from different spatial formations. It is not
enough to merely focus on 'gender relations' but for us to understand
how the 'dominant' notions of 'womanhood' and 'manhood' are also
intertwined with multiple scales such as constructions and geographies
of power along racial, ethnic, class, sexual, regional and international
dimensions. Explicit attention to spatially racialized and class
critiques of white First World feminisms by Black feminists, women of
color and African (a) diasporic scholars and feminisms offer invaluable
theoretical insights because such theorizations reveal the
naturalization of spatial whiteness within hegemonic feminisms, as well
as the investments that many feminists have in this neo-imperial project
(Nnaemeka 1998; Magubane 2001). Such theorizations are not a move to
occupy whiteness or First World privileges, nor are they simple
inversions of power (Spivak 1988); rather, they problematize the
trajectories of violence produced through the geographical assumptions
of First World feminisms.8 Such work raises questions about the
representations of localized and globalized geographies through the
attention to global structures of slavery, colonialism, imperialism and
capitalism that challenge First World Feminists' hierarchical and
segregated representations of feminism, gender violence and feminist
justice (Busia 1993; Chukukere 1995; Magubane 2004; Mama 2007). Bringing
together the insights of feminists who are attentive to the complexity
of geopolitics reveals how [the consolidation of Western Identity
formation depends on the division of the world into spaces that seem to
be disconnected from each other]{.underline}. [This makes possible other
violent processes of ontological disengagement with the 'Other' by
focusing on an ontic (i.e. a universalized and unified individual) that
is supposedly insulated and its production independent from social
relations.]{.underline} Feminisms of critical geographies question these
processes of geopolitical segregation by suggesting that feminists: (1)
recognize how significant segregation is of an imperial practice and
technology in the formation and constitution of social relations of
power; (2) form relations (i.e. bringing supposedly dissimilar phenomena
of feminism next to each other); and (3) draw and build upon the
histories of work put forth by women of color, Third World,
postcolonial, transnational, global and First World feminisms to
highlight the complexities and complicities of feminist engagements.
Feminisms of [critical geographies can draw out connectivities, tensions
and productive possibilities of contested-collaborative feminist spatial
praxis.]{.underline} The divisions of the world outlined above became
intensified beginning in the 1970s and the early 1980s. [Much of the
world, and especially under stringent conditions (e.g. militarizations,
forced mobilities, imprisonments, theft of their lands and labor), has
been forced to restructure on multiple scales its socio-economic,
political relations, ecologies and their own bodies. What many have come
to articulate as 'globalization' is really the dramatic demands made by
newer neo-imperial and capitalist regimes desiring the shifts of capital
in the hands of very few in the world by forcing personal, local,
national, regional and transnational restructurings]{.underline} (see
Chapters 15--19). Out of these contestations and restructurings,
dominant institutions like the UN and feminists have carved out space to
critique the privileges and violences of 'globalization' by accounting
for the ways familiar colonial intelligibilities and practices continue
to work (Agathangelou 2004; Conway 2008). [Feminist interventions into
the frameworks of globalization also disrupt new articulations of
imperialism that have been consolidated into a (neo) liberal 'global'
order]{.underline} (Aguilar and Lacsamana 2004). Within these dramatic
restructurings and geopolitical changes much feminist work has focused
on assessing and understanding 'globalization' and its effects on many
peoples and women in particular. [Critics of globalization focus on the
devastating effects of neoliberalism, its contingent projects such as
structural adjustment, the privatization of basic resources, decreased
wages, decreased social resources to support social welfare and the
poor, the militarization of everyday life and the effects of these
policies on the most impoverished populations in the Global
South]{.underline} (see for example, Gibson-Graham 1996; Naples and
Desai 2002; Kuokkanen 2008). However, globalization has also generated
the possibility of 'unintended onsequences' such as the transnational
feminist networks (Alvarez 2000; Moghadam 2005; see also Chapter 22).
Organizing in contexts outside the Global North has enabled feminists in
various spaces to critique the 'imperial march' and the 'Europology' of
Western feminisms and articulate it as 'an elaboration of what is a
distinctly European phenomenon into a human universal' (Oyewumi 2003:
1--3). The 'Europology' critique in Africa and Latin America (see for
instance, Lavrin 1998), emerged out of the experience of women's
revolutionary challenges to colonialism, capitalism, imperialism and the
counter-revolutionary insurgencies that took place from the 1960s to the
1980s and within post-revolutionary transitions to neo-liberalism (Mama
1997, 2007; Alvarez 2000). The spatially gendered, sexualized, classed,
racialized and nationalized divisions of the domestic and international
were challenged through feminists' own participation in revolutionary
organizations of social justice, which allowed engagement with other
women and men in a collective space to share their experiences. Many of
the spaces that such collective solidarities formed and shaped were
ridden with contradictions: societies were decolonized but their workers
were exploited in the social reproduction of their peoples and their
societies. Recognizing contradictions and multiple forms of gender
violence that various communities experienced daily has pushed more and
more intellectual and activist communities to bring a specifically
gendered analysis of women's and feminized labor exploitation into the
revolutionary organizations of different countries. Women's groups
rearticulated existent groups and created new organizations in civil
society during the post-revolutionary periods that promote explicitly
feminist structures, goals and agendas, albeit contradictorily (Mama
1997; Nagar 2002, 2008; Agathangelou and Spira 2007; Sarker 2007). It is
imperative to highlight how the academy is not separate from these
histories of movements and systemic restructurings. As Black and
postcolonial scholars (McKittrick 2006) with substantial histories of
their own enter the metropolitan academy, they too are marked by their
geopolitical origins both in the three-world schema (Wallerstein 1979)
and in their negotiated feminist-Black-postcolonial epistemic structure
within feminism and IR. [Postcolonial scholars arrive in the
metropolitan academy and are expected to enter as 'outsiders' to its
institutional politics as if the organization of the academy is not
already part of a global structure formed through the imbricate power
relationships of the Global North and Global South.]{.underline} Such
processes foster IR and feminism's appropriations of the geopolitical
intellectual labors of postcolonial scholars and spaces of the Global
South. Postcolonial scholars are often left to negotiate between the
colonial erasures of the academy and the politics of survival within an
'insider-outsider' epistemic structure (for example, see Kincaid 1988;
Lorde 2001; Alexander 2005). Many Black and postcolonial feminists are
supposed to be represented through the academy but always as 'contained
units' of social relations and called upon to perform Otherness. In this
sense, [the academy mystifies violence through the conditioning of
scholars as embodiments of their geopolitical 'homes,']{.underline}
(Grewal 2001; Mohanty 2003) [and demarcating which type of body produces
what type of knowledge. In other words, academic geopolitics defines and
legitimizes academic citizenry]{.underline}. The simultaneous
homogenization and segregation of scholars and scholarship within
academia -- either as a feminist of color who is often immediately
marginalized into one universal category of the Third World and/or as a
feminist who embodies a personal experience from Other global
territories considered 'out there' and separate from U.S. political
arrangements -- is a systemic relationship that divides feminists (of
color, postcolonial, white, transnational, global) through multiple
hegemonically defined geopolitical divisions of the international
system. Many times [these divisions do not allow for a reading of the
tensions that exist spatially, and consequently compromise feminist
projects of solidarity.]{.underline} [We propose that this asymmetrical
racial, class and national relation between First Worldism(s) and
postcolonial feminisms must always be located in such a way that takes
account of the intimate connections between those spaces of living (e.g.
physical and affective) and the processes of geopolitical relationality
within and between global inequality.]{.underline} These sets of
entangled social power relations are global, systemic, collective and
personal, and their connections are often elided within IR, which
sustains segregated and hegemonic geopolitical agendas that compete for
legitimacy within IR frameworks. For example, feminist IR focuses on
making women 'visible' and 'equal' within a masculinist geopolitical
Order, while postcolonial IR focuses on the explicit connections of
historical and contemporary racisms and classisms resulting from
imperial and colonial projects. Considering postcolonial and feminist
knowledges in a conjunctive space of feminisms of critical geographies
provides 'new' grammars for political claims that refuse individualized
readings of global politics and offers nuanced frameworks for addressing
international, transnational and global questions. Indeed, the meanings
of local, national, transnational, international and global feminisms
are put into question. Does the signifer 'transnational feminism'
denote, implicitly or explicitly, a specific cluster of practices and
discourses with particular political content, carried by particular
agents, reproduced through particular cultures of politics, and rooted
in particular histories? Does it project itself as universal, a revived
global sisterhood project carried by the high politics of a new, now
multicultural, highly mobile, well-resourced and globally visible
feminist vanguard? We suggest that it is not enough to argue for this
transnational feminist vanguard without putting pressure on its
constitution, formation and indeed the conditions of possibility of a
spatial praxis that is anti-colonial, anti imperial and just for the
majority of peoples in the world. The homogenous and segregated
representations of global inequality through geopolitical hierarchies
necessitate a mobilization of gender and transnational feminism as a
methodological and theoretical framework that is attentive to the types
of geographies we have been discussing here. [A postcolonial gendered
framework of global politics explores global relations of power
transnationally to complicate and desegregate existing taxonomies of
thought within larger structures of historical, political, economic and
social relations;]{.underline} it requires explicit attentiveness to
transnational formulations of race, gender, class and sexuality that can
complicate the 'discursive colonizations' (Mohanty 1991b) of
geopolitical bodies and dismantle segregated frameworks of 'technologies
of Empire' (Agathangelou et al. 2007). In particular, [postcolonial
gendered frameworks reveal how complicities and segregations within
feminism and postcolonial theories continue to deterritorialize and
reterritorialize global bodies within an imperial geopolitical
logic]{.underline} (Grewal 2005). It is our aim here to push the
conceptual and methodological underpinnings of gender and the
postcolonial transnationally, while also attending to the problematic
appropriations of these signifiers of geopolitics. A framework of
feminisms of critical geographies makes two important interventions
within hegemomic feminist and postcolonial approaches within IR. First,
[it problematizes the politics of 'gender mainstreaming' within
academia, activist and policy arenas by asking what are the ways in
which it regulates bodies through discourses of development, security
and rights that often elide how the logics and practices of
mainstreaming reproduce colonial, racist and gender asymmetrical
relations. Second, it challenges masculinist objectives within
postcolonial frameworks that too often center nationalist narratives,
which are 'premised on a rescued masculinity']{.underline} (Morrison
1992 cited in Alexander 1994: 14) [that polices gender, sexuality, race
and ethnicity for national interests]{.underline} (Alexander 1994,
2005). As we have discussed previously, the challenge of feminisms of
critical geographies is to further open up global questions of violence
and justice. What does it mean to think about feminist justice -- a
world where women, queer communities, people of color and the working
class are not marginalized, exploited and killed in the name of a
Feminist Global Order? How do we frame projects of solidarity among
feminists in an imperial context that thrives on segregation? [How do we
transform the politics of geopolitical containment that dictates
(im)possibility through racist heteronormative patriarchies of
representation?]{.underline} What are the ways in which we can
concretize feminisms of critical geographies? Considering the above
questions requires an engagement with geopolitical questions about
feminist epistemologies of spatiality in which the knowledges of
Black-postcolonial-Third World feminisms are already in relationship to
First World feminisms due to the organization and social structures of
the interstate system,9 or what we call here worldism. [If spaces of IR
and feminisms continue to take this interrelationship as mystified
and/or rendered invisible through mainstream epistemologies, then
dominant technologies of imperialism will continue to
prevail]{.underline}. However[, if feminisms and IR draw out the bodily
movements (people, land, knowledge) of postcolonial feminisms and Third
World historically situated subjects and expose these segregations as
part and parcel of larger hegemonic histories and practices of the
political economy of social relations and knowledge, then multiple modes
of solidarity become possible.]{.underline} Feminisms of critical
geographies signal worldism and geopolitical segregation as a way to
disrupt dominant theorizations and methods to world problems and issues
elided within hegemonic interdisciplinary studies and to 'renovate our
engagements' (Alexander 2005) with who we are as subjects and movements
'international,' 'transnational' and 'feminist.' It is our hope that
such renovations work to dismantle structures of apartheidism within
global knowledge movements and relations and create the space for deeper
theorizations of gender justice[. Praxis is crucially shaped and is
shaped by spatialities and the relations peoples have with it. Engaging
the questions of geographies through multiple feminist engagements can
open up the possibilities of how people resist, live and survive in
multiple contexts, and in particular contexts of global
violence.]{.underline} Through the insights of feminisms of critical
geographies, which build explicitly on Third World and transnational
feminist works, we argue that this segregation is more than just a mere
level of interpretation. It is as much about the global divisions of
labor as it is about the global struggles to co-constitute the world in
less violent and less segregationist manners. [Engaging explicitly with
the approaches of Third World and postcolonial feminisms shifts the ways
in which a transnational feminism comes into being and is able to
transform and build feminist solidarities]{.underline}. It is in these
varied and complicated spaces of feminisms (thought and practice), which
are attentive to the historic specificities and systemic connectivities
of geopolitics, that justice and feminist solidarities become a
possibility. The task of feminisms of critical geographies is not to be
responsible for 'solving' the problems of global inequality and gender
violence; rather, it is to open up the theoretical and material frames
of justice that support and build multiple epistemic and ontological
communities of survival and transformation. [It is through the opening
up of commitments to one another and negotiations of our complicities
that we can continue to intervene in geopolitical foreclosures that pit
us against one another in the various power struggles of global
politics.]{.underline}

#### The House of IR maintains itself through the continuous domestication and incorporation of the abject Other and its cognitive labor. Instead, we must learn to thrive outside the House in our own "illicit communities" that deny it a periphery to feed off and give us the tools to collapse the House altogether.

**Agathangelou and Ling 09** (Agathangelou, Anna M., and Ling, L. H. M.

[The House of IR treats those who labor in the ﬁelds of area studies
and/or comparative politics as "servants." These "downstairs" members
gather ethnographic, "thick descriptions" ("low politics") so that the
"upstairs" members may theorize grandly about the world ("high
politics"). Indeed, those upstairs depend on the ethnographic sustenance
and services provided by those downstairs, especially during times of
crisis (e.g., give us information: "who's in power in
China?").]{.underline} Yet the House of IR historically considers
comparative politics (with area studies as one of its components) to
contain a method only (for comparisons) and no substance (see Lijphart
1971). [As in any household, "servants" embody ambivalence. They are,
after all, the domesticated Other. In interviews with former Indonesian
domestics in Dutch colonial households, for example, Stoler (2002) ﬁnds
a distinct lack of sentimentality for their former employers.25 So, too,
do the servants of the House of IR grate at their marginalized,
exploited status. Instead of being treated as scholars and theorists in
their own right, the House of IR treats them as "native informants"
(Narayan 1997). And the minute they refuse to collaborate in such
schemes, these "native informants" are exiled from the House of IR.26
"Upstairs" members of the House welcome this asymmetrical division of
intellectual labor. It allows for so-called autonomous sites where there
is no clear relation between, for example, identiﬁcations of the
"global" and "First-World" either as theoretical frameworks or empirical
cases]{.underline}. Glossed over are the implications of these theories
on social relations. [Reading "native works" tends to reproduce
asymmetrical social relations, without interrogating the practices that
exploit and oppress "natives" like women, people of color, workers,
peasants, the environment. Exploitation and oppression continue through
(a) the constant division of the world into those who are "developed"
and need no more instruction, those who are "developing" and require
further education, and those who are "underdeveloped" and warrant more
external control and management, and (b) the production of ideas which
explain and justify this division through the institutionalization of
(Western, white, colonial) laws, rules, and ideas. Native informants
provide "order" for the House of IR.]{.underline} They discreetly let in
the "illegitimate" offspring produced by House members and "unruly,"
"native" traditions like Confucianism or socialism. [Progeny such as
Asian capitalism and peripheral-transitional economies become household
"wards" and, by extension, service the white colonial/imperial state and
its global capitalist consort. In this way, the House of IR contains the
challenge of these wards within a racialized, sexualized bourgeois
hierarchy.]{.underline} Again, Stoler's (2002) ﬁndings for the colonial
household on the outskirts of empire apply as well for the House of IR:
Métissage represented not the dangers of foreign enemies at national
borders but the more pressing affront for European nation-states, what
the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte so aptly deﬁned as the
essence of the nation, its "interior frontiers" . . . (Stoler 2002: 79)
D-Son Asian capitalism and the D-Twins peripheral and transitional
economies, respectively, exemplify this notion of an "interior
frontier." Their politics may seem conservative, given their attempts to
implement neoliberal economic development, but their epistemologies for
doing so are not. In this sense, these delegitimized wards of the House
of IR have more in common with their rebel brothers, marxism and
postmodernism, than is usually recognized. [Asian capitalism results
from mater liberalism forcing her attentions onto the Confucian
world-order]{.underline} since the nineteenth century (Ling 2002b).
Accordingly[, Asian capitalism exhibits such métis features as: a
Westphalian state grafted onto Confucian patriarchy, capitalist
rationality wrapped in collective institution-building, and market
development ordered through social hierarchy]{.underline} (Ling 2002a).
Yet the House of IR has exiled Asian capitalism as exotica only, not
worthy of theorizing -- until the latter gained enough economic clout to
bribe its admission. In the early 1990s, the Japanese government funded
a World Bank report that lauded Asia's "miracle" economies with their
state-led development as exemplars of liberal capitalism (World Bank
1993; Wade 1996; Berger and Beeson 1998[). Asian capitalism seemed on
its way to household legitimacy -- until a regional ﬁnancial crisis
struck (1997--98).]{.underline} We need not recount the crisis here.
What's noteworthy for our purposes is the vehement denunciation of Asian
Capitalism from the House of IR[. Neorealists and neoliberals trotted
out, without question or reﬂection, all the old colonial, racist
stereotypes about Asian "cronies," "despots," and
"mismanagement"]{.underline} (Ling 2002a). ["The Western form of
free-market capitalism," Alan Greenspan intoned, is the only model for
the world to follow]{.underline} (Greenspan, quoted in Singh and Weisse
1999: 204[). Thus the House of IR justiﬁed a return to the practices of
the white colonial/imperial state with its global capitalist agents
self-righteously "saving" Asian Capitalism by buying its bankrupt
enterprises at ﬁresale prices.]{.underline} As it appropriated major
sections of Asia's markets, so too did the House abscond with regional
ideas like an "Asian Monetary Fund," now re-lingoed into a "new global
ﬁnancial architecture" with a "social safety net" to prevent similar
disasters in the future (Wade 2007). Acceptance into the House of IR,
once so hopeful, is forever dashed. At most, Asian capitalism may enter
the House as a "ward," slipped inside by sympathetic but powerless
native informants. Neoliberalism has been busy with socialism and other
economic systems. With the fall of the Soviet empire and China's change
of economic heart to a limited form of capitalism, neoliberals have
sought to convert socialism and its economic cousins, but ended up
cavorting with them instead, producing the twin progeny of peripheral
and transitional economies. These exhibit an interesting mix of
masculinized realist state politics (e.g., antiterrorist campaigns
through anti-Other, anti-immigrant policies in Russia, the former Soviet
republics, and the Mediterranean states) and feminized neoliberal
developmental policies (e.g., importation of female migrant laborers for
sex and/or domestic work). As Agathangelou (2004b) shows, [peripheral
economies in the Mediterranean and European Union (EU),27 at the behest
of Core Economies in the European Union, have set up "security zones"
against the very population that they import for cheap labor. Yet the
House of IR continues to deny the discursive, normative, and theoretical
distinctiveness of these economies, insisting on characterizing them as
exemplary acolytes under Anglo-American-European
tutelage.]{.underline}28 [Three other "illicit" communities thrive
outside the House of IR: i.e., critics of Orientalism, postcolonial IR,
and worldism. None seeks acceptance into the House of IR.]{.underline}
They are not motivated by an angry sense of robbed entitlement though
each shares a clear lineage with members of the House[. Rather, each
intrinsically challenges, critiques, and engages with the
House]{.underline}, and centralizes conﬁgurations of race, gender,
sexuality, class, and nation. [Together, they constitute successive
generations of intimate alternatives to the House of IR.]{.underline}
The critique of orientalism springs from a union between literary theory
-- true exotica for the House of IR -- and two rebel sons, Marxism and
postmodernism. Edward Said (1979), a scholar of European literature,
drew on Gramsci and Foucault to understand and eventually coin the
term[, orientalism.]{.underline} It [refers to strategies taken by
Western Enlightenment leaders to construct the Self primarily by
negating the Other. In this case, the Other comes from a geographically
and culturally-demarcated "Orient"]{.underline} that ranges from Turkey
to Japan in latitude, and Mongolia to Australia in longitude. Said
analyzed French, German, and British travelogues, speeches, scientiﬁc
tracts, and religious documents, to detail how the "West" saw itself
vis-à-vis the "Oriental Other." He concluded that [a lopsided
logocentrism resulted with the Western Self monopolizing all the terms
of value ("beauty," "truth," "perfection," "progress," "rationality") at
the expense of the Oriental Other ("deformity," "evil," "incompletion,"
'stagnation," "chaos"). More than enslaving the Other, the West
emasculated it through a cultural/civilizational rape. The West
demonizes Islam today, Said charged, precisely because it has refused to
serve as a "civilizational womb." Western renditions of "the Palestinian
problem," for instance, typically dehistoricize and decontextualize the
region's complex history into an essentialized identity politics where
"Palestine" (by extension, "Islam") becomes equated with "terrorism" now
stamped as "evil"]{.underline} (Said 1988). [Israel, for instance, uses
such Orientalist presumptions as a basis for state policy toward the
Palestinians and their government. Orientalism's very raison d'être,
Said emphasized, was to rationalize violence in the colonial order
through the state]{.underline} (see Mitchell 1991). What results, as
demonstrated in Chapter One, is a reactive-parallel strategy of imperial
politics by both colonizer and colonized. Each feels justiﬁed to do onto
the Other what has been done to it in the past without regard to those
who are violated and sacriﬁced in the process. The latest product of
such angry, incestuous mirroring is the D-Terrorist, al Qaeda. al Qaeda
sprouts from the House of IR's preoccupation with Islam since the end of
World War II. Contrary to latter-day Orientalists who like to portray
Islam as congenitally immune to "modernity" (Buruma and Margalit 2002),
[al Qaeda has learned deftly from neorealist--neoliberal practices. Its
ﬁrst training came by crawling through the belly of the "Great Satan's"
beast, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), to oust the Soviets from
Afghanistan in the 1980s. Since then, al Qaeda has taken on neoliberal
corporate strategies to effect a global approach to
terrorism]{.underline} (Weber 2002). Postcolonial IR aims to transform
such rage and violence in world politics. Orientalism cross-fertilized
with the rebel twins, constructivism and pragmatism, has produced a
generation of [postcolonial theorizing]{.underline} applied speciﬁcally
to IR. It [combines the "world-making" and "multiperspectival"
approaches of constructivism--pragmatism with an explicitly postcolonial
agenda of rehistoricizing race, gender, class, and culture as integral
to narrations of Self and Other. Whereas orientalism identiﬁes a
particular social construction of Western Self vis-à-vis its Oriental
Other, postcolonial IR inquires into their structural and cultural
intimacies. Worldism pushes this inquiry even further. It begins by
re-articulating historical contestations, negotiations, conﬂicts,
struggles and violences as social relations. Second, worldism
interrogates the status quo production of subjects via race, class,
sexuality, nationalism, religion, and so on.]{.underline} These are not
simply stereotypes/narratives assigned to Self and Other but moreso
enactments of social power. [Third, worldism takes seriously the
existencre of multiple worlds, economies, and subjectivities. Girded by
Marxist historical materialism inﬂected through postcolonial
sensibilities, worldism constitutes a third alternative to the House of
IR.]{.underline} As Part II of this book details worldism, we refrain
from doing so here. For now, we emphasize that [worldism questions the
House of IR: its foundations ("power and interest"), its borders ("in vs
out"), the presumed identities and claims of its members ("legitimate vs
illegitimate"), their normative values ("good vs bad"), and asymmetrical
positionings ("up vs down").]{.underline} Indeed, [worldism challenges
the very project of constructing IR as a "house" in the ﬁrst place. The
academy rules in a manner similar to the House of IR. It appropriates
the knowledge, resources, and labor of racialized, sexualized Others for
its own beneﬁt and pleasure while billing itself as a "marketplace of
ideas." Others qualify as "innocent" children, wards, or servants at
best, or "unteachable" barbarians at worst.]{.underline} In either case,
[Others must wait faithfully for their admittance, if ever, into both
the academy and the House of IR.]{.underline}

Implications for governance in IR Such views of agency are quite
different to the views represented in [IR theory, where the state,
power, rights, norms, law, markets and civil society are frameworks in
which agency is constrained and systems, interests or norms are
maintained.]{.underline} It is also different to the forms of social
mobilization presented in recent work on global civil society,
transnational networks, norm transfer, which has been developed in the
work of Keane (2003), Kaldor (2003), Sikkink and Keck (1998) and Gill
(2003), among many. Compliance with an underlying meta-narrative means
that agency as expressed in these frameworks is understood as producing
an ideal notion of governance and related large-scale capacities
inherent in a liberal peace (Doyle, 1983), and global governance in the
form of international trade and capitalism (Rosenau, 1999). [[The
state]{.mark} is crucial in these dominant narratives because it [makes
mobilization]{.mark} in a range of areas, including war,
possible]{.underline} (Tilly, 1992: 67--95) [via its concentration [of
power]{.mark} and [resources,]{.mark} its [security]{.mark}
institutions, its ability to mobilize, its [aggregation of
interests,]{.mark} [territorialism and
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} and the weaknesses of its
accountability mechanisms in the face of elite interests and capacities.
States may also make peace and defend rights, but rarely aim at a
positive or emancipatory peace unless their citizens have legal and
political rights, and material leverage sufficient to force the state to
follow their collective wills. [It may protect others but rarely does so
given its simultaneous need to defend territorial
sovereignty]{.underline} (ICISS, 2001). [This is despite the reality of
democracy, rights, norms and redistribution at so many levels. [It is
indebted to]{.mark} the print [capitalism of power]{.mark}--- states,
markets and territorial sovereignty---[and detached from]{.mark} the
sources of legitimacy: [resistant agencies']{.mark} capacities for
peace]{.underline} (Anderson, 1991). Such dynamics are often
conceptualized mainly as problems of compliance from the subjects of IR
with overarching liberal and neo-liberal institutions and states,
whether they act in liberal or realist modes (Moravcsik, 1997[).
Realists engage with the problem of compliance with power between
states, whereas liberals engage with the problem of compliance with
norms among and within states.]{.underline} Whether one begins from the
problem of maintaining power or norms, state or society, or moderating
and negotiating them, **[[such]{.mark} [problem-solving dynamics have
become a disciplinary imperative which runs through realism to Critical
theory.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[More critical positions which engage
with resistance]{.mark}, agency, critique, root causes, inequality and
the infra-political aspects]{.underline} (Scott, 2009: x, 7) [of
sovereignty, power, institutions, identity or structures]{.underline},
offering a more democratic and imminent possibility of representation
and rights in global and local contexts. **[Many such approaches
[utilize the techniques of]{.mark} formal discourse---[institutions,
boundaries, singular]{.mark} [readings of history]{.mark} or of
[identity]{.mark} and state formation---[to construct]{.mark} state and
global [metanarratives of rights]{.mark}, constitutions, law,
[institutions, security]{.mark}, development [and markets]{.mark}. Once
such meta-narratives have formed [they become instruments for]{.mark}
which [compliance]{.mark} must be sought, to which end theory and
methods are then directed.]{.underline}** [[Such depoliticizing
assumptions are inheren]{.mark}t (often unintentionally) [in]{.mark} a
range of [liberal]{.mark} and social constructions of [IR as well
as]{.mark} in [Critical theory, which aspires to]{.mark} a form of
[cosmopolitanism that]{.mark} [rests on assimilation]{.mark} to the
status quo rather than difference and alterity]{.underline} (the fact
that these dynamics are present in realism is now widely accepted)
(Arditi, 2007; Hobson, 2007; Zehfuss, 2002: 195). They also emerge from
methodological approaches that are problemsolving and seek to provide
external explanations of political dynamics in order to reshape or
transform them by external actors according their own knowledge systems.
**[As postcolonial voices and alterity engages with IR, [such]{.mark}
mainstream [theories]{.mark} [adopt a defensive]{.mark}
[position]{.mark} rather than fully engaging with such critiques, often
partly [because of methodological limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Acharya and Buzan, 2007; Bilgin, 2008; Hindess, 2008; Smith, 2000).
**[[IR,]{.mark} like the state, [has failed]{.mark} in mainstream terms
[to offer emancipatory]{.mark} forms of [peace,]{.mark} [except on
neo-liberal and]{.mark} near or actual [neo-colonial terms]{.mark}
favouring key groups]{.underline}**. [[Both are]{.mark} dangerously
[unencumbered by methodological reflectivity, ontological openness or
ethical sensitivity.]{.mark}]{.underline} The best that can be claimed
is a cosmopolitan ethos (thick or thin) (Linklater, 2005), and a
sensibility towards democracy and rights (which of course is very
significant), even when it is clearly less concerned about inequality
and a lack of representation beyond the state, and which is embedded in
relations that have generally favoured the global north[. Pacification
rather than peace has been its aim: thus, it has difficulty in
explaining the resistances that have emerged in practice]{.underline}.
Sovereignty rather than human security and rights rather than needs as
priorities have unbalanced the way that institutions at the
international level, states and their own institutions, reflect autonomy
and human life. Development rather than empathy and recognition has done
likewise. Civil society rather than the actual grass-roots
constituencies of IR has tried to maintain disciplinary legitimacy but
in fact has excluded many. **[Mainstream [IR]{.mark}, and much liberal
peace theory which now draws strength from it, [does not
comprehend]{.mark} any [possibility for legitimate resistance]{.mark}
except through its own predetermined channels, [which]{.mark}
effectively [censor and narrow resistant
agencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thus the key forms of critical agency
which constructs local forms of legitimacy as a start for the
construction of regional and international networks of legitimacy are
blocked at their sources. Indeed, **[[calls for critical
commentaries]{.mark} towards the liberal peace to offer alternatives
[are]{.mark} normally [made through constraining]{.mark} methodological
and epistemological [frameworks]{.mark} (state-building, liberal rights
and institutions, markets, etc.), [which mean that contextual
experience,]{.mark} society, history, human needs [and]{.mark} security,
[identity]{.mark}, a range of non-rational institutions (customary,
religions, labour[), are excluded]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [As
[compliance theories depoliticize the subject rather than empowering
subalterns]{.mark} and resolving conflict and disagreements or enabling
states and international institutions to facilitate this,]{.underline}
such compliance orientations empowers agencies to resist (though they
must also hide their resistance to escape sanction). From here arises a
potential theory of resistance as a fundamental component of
international and social theory. It emerges in hidden and fragmented
ways rather than via the formal institutions of liberal political
mobilization. Where compliance is sought, resistance often emerges. Both
reproduce the crudest of binaries, but **[[compliance]{.mark} theories
often [lose sight of]{.mark} the basis for c[onsen]{.mark}t, legitimacy
and for the democratic impulse towards social justice and emancipation,
especially [in terms of class, gender, identi]{.mark}ty and, to some
extent, custom]{.underline}** (as an expression of shared social and
historical identity). **[Authoritarianism may be the result at the state
level and hegemony at the international level, [particularly where
the]{.mark} liberal [state is exported through
peace-building]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Chandler, 1999; Cooper, 2007;
Doyle and Sambanis, 2006; Duffield, 2001; Jahn, 2007; Krasner, 2004;
MacGinty, 2008; Paris, 2002, 2004; Pugh, 2005; Richmond, 2005; Snyder
2000). Even if the liberal state is the West's most advanced political
configuration, it does not necessarily represent a local or elite
consensus beyond the West. [The dangers of such binary oppositions have
been unintentionally promoted by IR, rather than reduced or
avoided]{.underline}. That this has occurred is not just the result of
problem-solving methodology, [but because of [the depoliticization of
theory, the academic subject and]{.mark} their positionality, the
rejection of [subjectivity]{.mark} which has meant the exclusion of much
of the world's population from the discipline, and from the overriding
goal of peace itself. Civil society [has allowed itself to be
narrowed]{.mark} and constrained]{.underline} by raison d'Etat, as
Foucault might argue (2004: 287). **[[The discipline has been co-opted
into a policy project of peace as a western]{.mark}/northern
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather than in developing an
understanding of the conditions of conflict and peace brought about it
by its participants in a more everyday sense (Richmond, 2009). When this
consensus arises (as the everyday becomes more prominent due to
methodological developments and the rise of postcolonial actors (Nel,
2010), political actors and organizations) it is unlikely to be simply
reflective of political liberalism and the modern state, contrary to
attempts to rescue such a consensus (Ikenberry, 2009; Paris, 2010).
**[[IR has automatically ascribed to resistance an a priori status of
normative and strategic inferiority, irrelevance, illiberalism, spoiling
or injustice]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [These attempts translate into a
paternalistic and authoritarian project when viewed from
below]{.underline}. Power may be more visible because of IR's
problem-solving methodological bias, but resistant, critical agency is
effective and versatile, especially in terms of creating rights, dealing
with needs, accountability and democracy, even if it is invisible
(Eschle and Maiguashca, 2005). Ironically, IR is based on political,
economic, social and cultural models which are supposed to be rights and
needs oriented, representative and just. Ultimately, subjects may have
become complicit in their own depoliticized pacification (Shaull, 1996
\[1970\]: 12), though this realization has sparked the exercise of
discursive resistance and critical agency. The discipline has become
focused on producing compliance with a pre-ordained understanding of
governance. T[hese strategies have historically been constructed by a
northern elite, with some input from global peripheries. Political
subjectivity is therefore shaped by compliance with the world-view of
the main or most visible voices and theories of IR and their sovereignty
(effectively of the few not the many, promoted by problem-solving,
liberal, and capitalist biases in knowledge production, by alliances
with powerful policy-makers and institutions]{.underline}). This tells
only the narrowest story about how peace and conflict arise.
Subjectively, has been affected by resistance and compliance.

Social relations of power underwrite the House of IR. These account for
IR as a discipline, a source of knowledge production, and a ﬁeld of
practical politics. [Though hidden behind public positions, reforms, and
standards that seem internationalist and fair in scope, colonial
erasures, violences, and desires perpetuate parochial and discriminatory
practices. For this reason, the House valorizes IR Cosmo Man.29 He
serves as globalization's most logical and desirable embodiment while
policing patriarchal borderings of race, gender, class, and culture in
IR.]{.underline} Patriarchy's intellectual production is not new, as
indicated by the quote from Hr Xuân Hu'o'ng, an eighteenth-century
feminist poet from Vietnam, at the beginning of this chapter. [What is
new about Cosmo Man in the House of IR, though, is that his version of
world politics is imposed on all Others, regardless of race, gender,
class, sexuality and nationality. In this way, the House of IR elides
its own collusion with power under the guise of "objective" and
"rational" knowledge production. So, too, does the academy. The academy
interacts with power ambivalently. It publicly welcomes "multicultural,"
"international" education while privately making it difﬁcult to tenure
and promote faculty, especially those of color and women, who challenge
capitalist-patriarchy's version of Self and Other. In this way, the
academy re-enacts those desires and abuses that shadow the colonial
household]{.underline}. Yet institutions of higher learning increasingly
clamor for multicultural, international education.30 [Externally, the
academy needs to satisfy globalization's demand for a more cosmopolitan,
educated elite. Internally, the academy also needs to globalize to: (a)
retain an increasingly multi-ethnic student body, especially those who
can pay high tuition fees during times of constricting budget cuts,31
(b) uphold its liberal reputation as a "marketplace of ideas," and (c)
keep apace with managerial, ﬁnancial, and technical trends arising in
various parts of the world.]{.underline} [These apparent contradictions
allow the academy and its elites to use the intellectual labor of Others
while denying them due credit or acknowledgement for it. This
appropriation]{.underline} is not for cultural stakes only. [It provides
an intellectual justiﬁcation for an unequal access to and distribution
of wealth.]{.underline} Not surprisingly, white males dominate our
discipline. A July 2005 report from the American Political Science
Association (APSA) on the advancement of women in the profession found
that: \[d\]espite substantial gains at all academic ranks since the
1970s, women comprise only 24 percent of all full-time faculty in 2001,
an increase of just 6 percent since 1991. The percentage of women
assistant professors has stalled at about 35 percent over the past ﬁve
years. Ironically, the overall increase in women political science
faculty is largely due to steady growth in numbers of women at the full
professor level. More and more women are now hired in part-time or
non-tenure-track positions, while the percentage of men in these
categories is declining. (APSA 2005) Data on postgraduate enrollment in
US academies mirror this initial scenario (NCES 2004). A relatively even
spread of men and women not only enter the classroom but also graduate
with higher degrees. In the social sciences, women accounted for 57
percent of all graduate enrollments in 1997 (Brandes et al. 2001: 325).
As a general category, women received 49 percent of doctorates in the
social sciences in 1993, with a steady increase for women of color.32
The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) projected this trend
to continue until the end of the century (NCES 1997). Yet all male
faculty enjoy an average 10 percent advantage in salary at both public
and private institutions (Bellas 2002) while nearly half of all faculty
appointments made at institutions of higher learning fall in the adjunct
or other part-time category -- with women as the majority recipients
(AAUP 1993).33 A recent study claims that institutions, more than
discrimination, accounts for a gender gap in wages (Glenn 2008). Women
tend to teach more at public, master's level institutions where teaching
overtakes research and its funding possibilities. Still, this study
could not explain why a gap of \$3,200/year between male and female
professors still persists at research universities. Nor do these data
break down according to racial categories. Anecdotal evidence suggests,
however, that the racial and gender disproportion found in the academy's
"formal (tenure-track) sector" would spill over to its "informal
(adjunct)" one. [Another recent study by Monroe, Ozyurt, Wrigley and
Alexander (2008) indicates the entrenched nature of gendered problems in
the academy. The authors argue that the situation of women "within the
Academy, an entity somewhere between a medieval guild, Byzantine ﬁefdom,
and corporate bureaucracy"]{.underline} (Monroe et al. 2008: 230),
[draws on the same political strategies and institutional power regimes
as the neoliberal imperium to secure asymmetries and
inequalities]{.underline}. The authors conclude the following after
analyzing salary data and interviewing 80 female faculty at a large,
research institution: [Overt discrimination has largely given way to
less obvious but still deeply entrenched inequities]{.underline} . . .
Women attributed the persistence of gender inequality not to biology but
to a professional environment in which university administrators care
more about the appearance than the reality of gender equality and a
professional culture based on a traditional, linear male model. (Monroe
et al. 2008: 215) [At root, we argue, are the intersections of race with
gender. These social relations and their problematic discursive frames
remain assumed, rather than examined, in the academy.]{.underline} For
example, one Asian-American female professor observed that, \[i\]f we
act like the \[passive\] Singapore Girl, in the case of some professors,
then they feel "she is \[unequal to me\]." If we don't act like the
Singapore Girl, then \[our\] accomplishments must have derived from "a
relationship with the chair" \[or some other senior male\]. (quoted in
Cho 1997: 209) In either case, Cho concludes, an Asian-American woman --
or any [woman of color -- has difﬁculty obtaining recognition for her
professional achievements. This is so, we add, because she must function
in a context -- an institutional power base -- like the House of IR,
that is deﬁned by similar logics of the white colonial/imperial state
intimately aligned with global capitalism]{.underline}. As Stoler notes,
["sexual control was more than a convenient metaphor for colonial
domination. It was a fundamental class and racial marker implicated in a
wider set of relations of power"]{.underline} (Stoler 2002: 45).
[Similarly, the academy has preserved its privileges with racialized,
sexualized colonial management, buttressed by a process that deracinates
and depoliticizes knowledge. Epistemic erasure]{.underline}, in short[,
is inﬂicted on the Other. In deracinating and depoliticizing knowledge,
epistemic erasure psychologizes systemic pathologies while mystifying
the exploitation and violence committed onto Others. Some Others, in
turn, consent to internalize their own structural oppression in exchange
for admission into the House not as a "servant" or "ward" but as an
"honored guest." At the same time, another desire complex arises in the
House of IR. It publicly seeks to do good ("spreading democracy") while
privately yearning for adoration and respect from the Other, a desire
that can never be satiated ("why do they hate us?").]{.underline} In a
volume self-consciously titled, Global Voices: Dialogues in
International Relations (Rosenau 1993), four IR scholars (2 men, 2
women, all white) critically discuss the ﬁeld. Each scholar deserves due
credit, for his/her insights have contributed to our own understanding
and evaluation of the House of IR. Nonetheless, one chapter by a
postmodern feminist disturbs (Sylvester 1993). She seeks validly to
introduce race and difference into the dialogue on IR but masks her
privilege with a colonizing move. She writes in the name of a Zimbabwean
woman rather than having an actual conversation with one. The chapter is
written creatively in the form of a play with exchanges from various
characters: i.e., Westfem and Tsitsi. Westfem represents a Western
standpoint feminist; Tsitsi, a Zimbabwean woman. Throughout the play,
Tsitsi speaks only in terms of her own particularities whereas Westfem
pronounces on theory, history, and politics in a universal tone. At one
point, Westfem even lectures Tsitsi about Zimbabwean men to which the
latter submissively agrees. Indeed, Westfem speaks for all; Tsitsi only
for herself, and not very well. In fact, Tsitsi admits as much.
Westfem-self, I tell you, we women have been gagged by tradition and
colonialism for so long that now it is difﬁcult for us to insist on our
own voices, ideologies, and statecrafts. (Sylvester 1993: 30) Such
epistemic, political, and personal erasure pervades the House of IR.
[The US academic self-righteously presents the woman of color as a
victim of "third-world" patriarchy in need of "ﬁrst-world" feminist
rescue without questioning either her right or place to do so. No wonder
many women of color, inside and outside the West, react to "feminism" as
another form of "imperialism." The House of IR beneﬁts from such
in-ﬁghting.]{.underline} As noted earlier[, those who live "upstairs" by
theorizing about "high politics" take little account of those who labor
"downstairs" with their data collecting for "low politics" -- until some
crisis in world politics demands speciﬁc, local knowledge.]{.underline}
At that point, [ethnographic "servants" must produce the information
necessary for House members to plug into their established theories.
They treat this information as data only, not subject to theorization or
capable of overhauling existing frameworks]{.underline}. Note, for
example, recent revelations of torture and sexual abuse by American
soldiers against Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib[. Mainstream attention
has localized the relations between US soldiers and Iraqi prisoners.
Media pundits, military leaders, and psychological experts explain away
the abuse as a psychological distortion rather than expressions of a
larger socio-economic and political pathology]{.underline}: i.e., abuse
of US power to secure hegemony for global capitalist-patriarchy. [No one
asks]{.underline}, for example, [why certain identities ("minority,"
"them," "queer") are always the target of abuse, while others
("majority," "us," "heterosexual") perpetrate it?]{.underline} As
Sherene Razack (2000, 2004) demonstrates in her analysis of similar
abuses by and among Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia[, colonial legacies
of race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation spare no one -- not even
those ﬁghting for "peace," "democracy," and "justice." Scholars from
outside the West sometimes internalize this epistemic erasure. The
"insecurity" of states in the South, writes Mohammed Ayoob (1992), stems
from internal, not external, sources. Their lack of "maturity" in state
development renders them "weak, intruder, have-nots," eternally
dependent on the North for economic and military assistance, producing a
sense of "impotence" and "deprivation" that leads to a "perpetual state
of schizophrenia"]{.underline} (1992: 71--91). In contrast, [Ayoob
characterizes states in the North as "developed," "mature," "rich,"
"powerful," "the center"; they are,]{.underline} in short[, the
"managers of the international system"]{.underline} (1992: 71--91).
Ambivalence suffuses such scholarship[. Though motivated to "brea\[k\]
the \[knowledge\] monopoly that control\[s\]" the international
system]{.underline} (Ayoob 2002: 27)[, scholars like Ayoob nonetheless
reproduce it. He proposes a "subaltern realism" to "supplement" or, at
most "dent," IR. Yet]{.underline} this [resorts to similar conventions
of "timeless" and "universal" maxims by explaining "third-world states"
in terms of their "essential" and "fundamental" nature.]{.underline}
Ayoob aims to broaden IR with alternative perspectives, [yet he remains
lodged in classical, Western theoretical frames]{.underline} and
supports his arguments with references to conventional readings of
Hobbes. Most troubling is Ayoob's failure to address how
imperial/colonial capitalism draws asymmetrically on mediations of
"ﬁrst-" and "third-world" states to achieve its vision and mission. Nor
does he recognize the existence of each world within the other leading
to a similar outcome for all. One could argue that collective
schizophrenia afﬂicts states in the "North" as much as those in the
"South." David Held, for instance, asserts that democracy is not a "ﬁxed
notion." It could be "re-invented" and "cosmopolitanized" by "deepening
democracy within nation-states and extending it across political
borders," thereby better serving our globalized, contemporary world
order.34 Held's proposition seems reasonable until we remember
capitalism's role in producing the nation-state. Among other things, the
nation-state "uniﬁed \[a\] legal code that protected private property .
. . This economic act was, of course, represented as the creation of a
harmonious community of people with a common language and a coherent
culture and worldview" (Ebert 1999: 393). Held seeks to reform
globalization's new transnational institutions but neglects to query:
why would the capitalist state and its advocates want to "deepen"
democracy when they beneﬁt daily from the exploitation of labor and
other structural inequalities? Globalization may open new opportunities
for some but it also entails for most a "struggle over structured
inequality in the world economy" (Ebert 1999: 5).35 Cosmopolitan
democracy may aim for more equality and justice but it conveys, instead,
an elite class position replete with bourgeois, patriarchal interests.
Consequently, cosmopolitan democracy cannot recognize and support those
that it claims to. The concept remains an elegant, if remote, ideal with
which to tantalize the world but which never ﬁnds concrete expression.
Still, many at the pinnacle of the capitalist world economy ask: why do
they hate us? [With Cosmo Man in charge of IR both as a discipline and
as a source of knowledge production, we return to]{.underline} the theme
of Chapter One: i.e., [contending bouts of hypermasculinity in world
politics]{.underline}. Ostensibly, [world politics involves
hypermasculine jousts in politics]{.underline} (e.g., "terrorists" vs
"inﬁdels," "democratic regime change" vs "occupation"),
[economics]{.underline} (e.g., "developed" vs "developing," "structural
adjustment reforms" vs "neocolonialism"), [and culture]{.underline}
(e.g., "civilization" vs "hegemony"). In actuality, [practices of
masculinity erase historical alternatives to "democracy" or "Islam" or
"development.]{.underline}" These denials manifest themselves most
glaringly in the current transnationalization of militarization.
[Alternative movements for "democracy" (e.g., indigenous movements,
Zapatistas), "Islam" (e.g., secular governance in Arab states), or
"development" (e.g., World Social Forum) lose out in this masculinity
game. They do not comply with the abstract individualism and
self-aggrandizing power mongering that militarization and marketization
demand.]{.underline} Similarly, global practices of masculinity ignore
women's groups, peace organizations, labor unions, and other entities
even though these daily impact world politics through conﬂict
resolution, crisis prevention, food distribution, and other forms of
collective action. [Technology becomes the only ﬁxation in town, and
cynicism pervades all. Perpetrators claim that they resort to violence
on behalf of democracy and freedom but they kill, violate, and torture
their own as much as the enemy]{.underline}. Razack dissects one hazing
ritual among Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia, videotaped and later
broadcast on Canadian television. "A black corporal had 'KKK' written on
\[his\] shoulder . . . \[while being\] tied to a tree," sprinkled with
ﬂour, referred to as Michael Jackson's "secret," symbolically anally
raped, and required to crawl on all fours (2000: 139). White soldiers
torture their black brothers-in-arms by re-enacting colonial racism's
iconic images of the Other. They brand the black recruit instead of
lynching him, taunt him for not being white, feminize him as a sex toy,
and compare him to an animal. Such acts of racialized, sexualized
torture are neither new nor limited to institutions of incarceration
"out there." Domestic prisons in the US exhibit similar abuses
(Surkiewicz 2004; Agathangelou, Bassichis and Spira 2008).
Militarization has arrived "in here." [The academy must recognize -- and
redress -- its complicity in world politics. IR as taught in the academy
reﬂects and validates the voices, visions, and actions of such elite
"world-makers" as representatives of the state, civil society, the
media, the corporate sector, and those in non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) who support the neoliberal imperium]{.underline}, not to mention
the academy itself. But there's another category of "world-makers" --
and their contestations and struggles already affect the academy. These
world-makers are not-so recognized, often illegalized and/or at the
margins, and rarely heard from or seen as actors in world politics, such
as the stateless (e.g., displaced persons, illegal migrants, refugees),
the illicit (e.g., smugglers, prostitutes, drug trafﬁckers, maﬁa gangs),
and the informalized (e.g., the young, the poor, the illiterate, the
feminized, and the "non-Westernized"). These groups affect world
politics as much as, and sometimes more so than, their elite
counterparts. Yet IR as a discipline -- the academy as a whole --
remains ﬁxated on the former to the exclusion of the latter. 9/11 has
demonstrated clearly that world politics cannot continue with "business
as usual." It must come to a more worldly sense of world politics[. This
means engaging seriously with the idea that the world is multiple and
that those "at the margins" directly relate with those "at the center of
power." Linking world politics as a realm of practical politics with
sources of knowledge production and a ﬁeld of academic training and
education demands that we begin with this recognition of the academy's
complicity.]{.underline}

here not to one particular author or theory but rather [\"a family of
arguments related by a common set of fundamental, if often unspoken,
commitments\"]{.underline} (Rupert 1995:3). Though labeled a peculiarly
\"American social science\" (Hoffmann 1995), realism claims an
intellectual lineage that dates to ancient Greek history, especially
that recorded by Thucydides in 5 BC. Subsequently, realists have added
luminaries of power politics like Machiavelli and Hobbes to their
roster. But it was a generation of scholars from post-World War II
Europe, Britain, and the United States that gave realism its distinctive
voice. [Power, they asserted, reflects objective laws of
calculated]{.underline} (sometimes amoral) [selfinterest for all states
across time and space]{.underline}. John Herz, George F. Kennan, Walter
Lippmann, and Hans J. Morgenthau each saw \"political realism\" as the
cure to what they considered the fateful causes of war among nations:
\"legalism,\" \"utopianism,\" and \"idealism\" (Keohane 1986:9).
Abstract individualism pivots realism\'s understanding of the world.

over resources that confer power and wealth. In this way, realists
justify instrumental reasoning and behavior. But then how do realists
explain the existence of an interdependent international political
economy in at world of conflicting nation-states? Hegemonic stability
theory comes to the rescue (Kindleberger 1973). It posits a dominant
state or hegemon that willingly bears the asymmetrical costs of global
leadership so the interstate system may survive peacefully and
prosperously despite anarchy and competition. Game theoretic models
explain such cooperation under anarchy as a prisoner\'s dilemma. Still,
these approaches preserve realism\'s basic premise in abstract
individualism. It places outside the realm of realist inquiry issues
like ideology, the social bases of state power, its practices, political
struggles, and strategies for reproduction (Rupert 1995). Yet [realists
openly accept their origin in the white colonial/imperial
state.]{.underline} They read the History of the Peloponnesian War as
Athens\' struggle against Sparta for hegemony in the ancient world.
Realists perpetually emphasize what they claim to be Thucydides\' key
lesson in power: \"The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what
they must.\" In this way, [realists rationalize empire\'s brutal legacy,
turning it into an ideological and political commitment.]{.underline}
[Expect violence and colonization]{.underline}, realists trumpet, [for
it is integral to empire]{.underline}. And [empire]{.underline}, they
add, [is what international politics is all about]{.underline}. That
realists ignore Athens\' demise due to ambition and greed conveniently
silences another reading of this text, such as the crisis of empire and
its implications not only for world politics but the empire itself (see
Ling 2002, 2002b: 106-108 for alternative readings of Thucydides).
[Realism stems from another lineage, rarely acknowledged: the global
capitalist economy]{.underline}. It accounts for realism\'s birth into
the world and its growth, sustenance, and eventual dominance in the
House of IR. In turn, **[realism theorizes an ideational infrastructure
for global capitalism\'s public, political face: the modern, capitalist
state]{.underline}** (Agathangelou 1997). [What is]{.underline} all this
warring [imperialism for if not more wealth and resources for national
elites?]{.underline} Lenin attributed World War I to intra-elite
scrambles for capitalist market shares, but these started when Europe\'s
merchant ships first set sail for Asia and Africa in the fifteenth
century, seeking lucrative trades in silks and spices. Global capitalism
delivers what the white colonial/imperial state seeds. Mater Liberalism.
[Liberalism naturally allies with realism]{.underline}. [It shares
common roots in the white colonial/imperial state and its relationship
with global capitalism, albeit with a conceptual division of
labor]{.underline} (Agathangelou 1997). [Whereas realism
commands]{.underline} the House of [IR by focusing on the
state]{.underline} (\"power\"), [liberalism organizes, manages, and
reproduces it by emphasizing the market]{.underline} (\"interest\") (cf.
Gilpin 1987). [Liberalism]{.underline} started out as a proud tradition
of defiance against authority, such as Martin Luther\'s fiery
repudiation of Catholic Church hegemony in sixteenth century Europe.
Since then, it [has evolved into an ideological instigator of \"free
trade,\" \"open markets,\" \"instrumental rationality,\" and other
pillars of global capitalism]{.underline} (Polanyi 1944; Hirschman
1977). [Realism and liberalism work in tandem]{.underline} by drawing on
the mirage of \"politics\" [and]{.underline} \"economics.\" Publicly,
they [convince \"contemporary statesmen]{.underline} \[like\] the
mercantilists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
\[[that]{.underline}\] [power]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a
[necessary]{.underline} condition for plenty, and vice versa\" (Keohane
1984: 22). Privately, [realism-liberalism maintains an infrastructure of
elite, bourgeois rule]{.underline} by seeming to care about democratic
peace, prosperity, and freedom-but not really.\" Realism-liberalism\'s
abstract, ahistorical conceptions of the state, the market, and the
individual are bound by particular cultural expressions (Western, white,
male) that result from concrete political struggles (bourgeois,
colonial). Yet [both \"world\"]{.underline} (materiality, structured
inequalities) [and \"politics\"]{.underline} (practices, discourse)
[disappear from world politics]{.underline} (Agathangelou 1997).
Classical liberals like Kant, Locke, and Woodrow Wilson, for instance,
advocated a legally based \"perpetual peace,\" \"limited government,\"
and a \"league of nations\" to forestall global warfare that, by
extension, preserve the realist-liberal interstate, commerce-based
system, in principle if not in form. Similarly, contemporary liberals
like Hedley Bull (1966) and David Held (1995) talk of an \"international
society\" or \"cosmopolitan democracy,\" respectively, but without
regard to the worldviews or participation of Others in these processes.
A [second generation of liberalism]{.underline}, [most prominently
neoliberalism]{.underline}, continues this tradition. It [professes good
intentions for the masses while complying with elite demands for new
ideas for and methods of preserving colonial-patriarchalcapitalist
structures and their necessary subjectivities]{.underline}. Liberal and
standpoint feminism cheerlead from the rear as they seek to liberate
\"Third-World\" women to become more like their \"First-World\" sisters.
Still, nothing is what it seems. As we will see below, mater liberalism
and daughter neoliberalism each have sought to convert others with
missionary zeal but have ended up, instead, with hybrid progeny.

## 2AC -- SECURITY LOGIC IS BAD

#### Security has become hypermasculinized. In the wake of 9/11 the state looms like a patriarchal household that hyperfeminizes women, reducing them to damsels in distress in need of liberation. This necessitates the militarization of the white male body as an expendable weapon of Empire.

**Agathangelou and Ling 09** (Agathangelou, Anna M., and Ling, L. H. M.
*Transforming World Politics: From Empire to Multiple Worlds.*
Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, 2009, pgs 32-35.)//Squirms

Transnationalizing insecurity militarizes daily life. [The state or
community looms large like a garrisoned, patriarchal household that
claims to protect women, children, and other subjugated ("weak")
subjects from rapacious "outsiders." Yet it is precisely the silent,
hyperfeminized labor and surplus resources of women and subjugated
subjects that enable such hypermasculinized security in the ﬁrst place.
Racializing and gendering labor further contains dissent by shackling
men and women, physically and ideologically, to imperial
rule]{.underline}. Since 9/11, Bush and bin Ladin have deployed this
kind of empire-building in parallel ways: i.e., the former in neoliberal
terms; the latter, in fundamentalist, religious ones. As mentioned in
Chapter One[, Bush invoked eight guidelines for the American people to
remain "normal." These recall traditional maxims to the law-abiding
housewife, concubine, or mistress. Her mission in life: to maintain a
happy home for husband and children.]{.underline} Who could disparage
such a cozy scenario? Other politicians jumped onto the same thematic
bandwagon: "go shopping" (former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani),
"buy that car" (Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle), or "take that trip"
(US Senator John Kerry). A television commercial shown shortly after
9/11, sponsored by the Travel Industry Association of America,
superimposed images of "ordinary folks" from hotels, restaurants,
airlines -- all the tourism industries that suffered from the attacks --
repeating Bush's line that economic consumption "takes care" of the
national family. [The national-security state thus pushes and lulls
citizens into sacriﬁcing for it. They are asked to spend scarce
resources despite increased income disparities and rising unemployment
in the face of unprecedented corporate proﬁts, especially in the oil
industry. And these trends have continued, if not deepened.]{.underline}
The New York Times reported on 29 March 2007 that "income inequality
\[in the US\] grew signiﬁcantly in 2005, with the top 1 percent of
Americans -- those with incomes that year of more than \$348,000 --
receiving their largest share of national income since 1928" (Johnston
2007), one year before the stock market crash that triggered the Great
Depression. Similarly, The Guardian noted on 3 July 2008 that US
unemployment was at its worst since 2002 (Seager 2008). Yet proﬁts for
oil industry giants like Exxon Mobil soared to \$40.6 billion in 2007,
according to the 1 February 2008 issue of US News & World Report
(Lavelle 2008). Likewise, bin Ladin claims to preserve the "true"
Islamic nation. His sovereign homeland comes from a way of life guided
by conservative Islam. But nowhere in his speeches, interviews,
videotapes, nor pronouncements does he offer an alternative to
oppression, exploitation, hierarchy, intolerance, or poverty. Nor does
he articulate an Islamic path to economic development that will improve
people's lives. He suggests only an other-worldly vision of Islamic
"paradise" attained through "jihad." For this earthly domain, he seeks a
modern, technically-sophisticated economy (especially drawn from the
global arms trade) but delinked from the West. Both camps brand their
agendas of hypermasculine/hyperfeminine competition on the bodies of men
and women. [The battleﬁeld affects men's bodies most directly but ﬁrst
come notions of masculinity. Since 9/11, America's newfound concern for
Afghan women has been accompanied by a swelling re-appreciation,
announced in the New York Times, for "\[b\]rawny, heroic, manly
men]{.underline}" (Brown 2001: 5). These are exempliﬁed by ". . . stoic,
muscle-bound \[ﬁreﬁghters and police ofﬁcers\] . . . exuding competence
from every pore . . ." (Brown 2001: 5).3 The venerable newspaper quoted
what seemed to be a growing, national sentiment: ["\[T\]here's a longing
for manliness. People want to regain what we had in World War II. They
want to believe in big, strapping American boys"]{.underline} (Brown
2001: 5). [Given the military's racial segregation during World War II
and mainstream America's general neglect of heroic duty undertaken by
its "colored troops," both African and Asian-American, these images
implicitly evoke "big, \[white\] strapping American boys."4 bin Ladin's
call for "martyrdom" makes a parallel historical erasure. Men contribute
their physical lives to reorder the chaos wreaked by centuries of
imperial desires from the West. Simultaneously, bin Ladin wants to
reclaim Islam's injured masculinity from the West:]{.underline} \[O\]ur
brothers who fought in Somalia\...saw wonders about the weakness,
feebleness, and cowardliness of the US soldier \...They want to deprive
us of our manhood. We believe that we are men, Muslim men who must
defend the greatest place in existence, the Holy Ka'ab. We want to have
the honour of defending it. We do not want American women soldiers . . .
defending the grandchildren of \[Muslim leaders\] . . . The rulers in
that region have been deprived of their manhood. And they think that the
people are women. By God, Muslim women refuse to be defended by these
American and Jewish prostitutes. (Ramazani 2001) [bin Ladin decries the
West as "depriving" Islam of its manhood. At the same time, he
hypersexualizes American and Jewish women soldiers by concocting them
into "prostitutes."]{.underline} bin Ladin shifts from his seeming
concern for Islamic manhood to assigning women to serve his version of
the greater Islamic good, rather than their empowerment or welfare.
[\[Death\] takes on a meaning suffused with "masculinity" because death,
power, and political representation are closely intertwined. While death
has always been an important motif, in the context of political
oppression it becomes a dramatized scene of subjectivity and
empowerment. . . It is through the "otherness" of femininity and its
domestication that men gain subjectivity and agency in the scene of
martyrdom . . .]{.underline} Women enter the fundamentalist
reconstruction of the past always in the form of wives, mothers,
daughters, not as individuals. (Moallem 1999: 336--337) Women's bodies
are used, additionally, to mystify elite privilege. [Bush appropriated a
liberal feminist understanding of woman to bolster his case against the
woman-hating bin Ladin/al Qaeda/Taliban]{.underline} (Bumiller 2001b:
B2).5 [Yet no such commitment preoccupied the Administration before
9/11, despite mounting evidence of Taliban misogyny.]{.underline}6
Afghanistan's underground women's organization, the Revolutionary
Association of Afghan Women (RAWA), charged the US government with
turning a blind eye to the Taliban's fundamentalism and misogyny,
perhaps even abetted it, to expel the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan
and secure an oil pipeline through Central Asia (RAWA 2001).7 The Bush
Administration itself admitted that women comprised 50 percent of
government workers, 70 percent of school teachers, and 40 percent of
doctors in pre-Taliban Afghanistan (Bumiller 2001a: B2). Despite all
this liberating, [the female Other remains a silent, inscrutable object
of desire. Notwithstanding the Bush administration's promises, no women
were represented at the post-Taliban, nation-building talks held in
Bonn, Germany, in November--December 2001, although two women were
appointed to a post-Taliban government.]{.underline}8 Indeed[,
contemporary media outlets]{.underline} like National Geographic [have
popularized an image of the Muslim woman as a half-veiled, muted waif,
eyeing the white-male world beseechingly and remotely. This motif
reﬂects a longstanding, Orientalist tradition of treating the female
Other as young (underdeveloped), appreciative (subordinate), and
tantalizingly mysterious (inscrutable)]{.underline} (see Ling 1999[). al
Qaeda exploits a more particular form of femininity: i.e., woman as
reproductive machine.]{.underline} bin Ladin and his cohorts assume
without question that committed women of Islam would supply human fodder
for their cause. Note this quote from a 35-year-old conservative Muslim
mother, speaking deﬁantly to a US journalist shortly after the 9/11
attacks: In the name of God, I will sacriﬁce my son, and I don't care if
he is my most beloved thing. For all of my six sons, I wanted them to be
mujahedeen. If they get killed it is nothing. This world is very short.
I myself want to be a mujahid. What will I do in this world? I could be
in heaven, have a weekly meeting with God. (Addario 2001: 38) One
wonders, after the journalist leaves, what this mother really thinks and
feels[. Hypermasculine certainty masks an underlying insecurity. Muslim
women's very status as objects of desire -- that is, as mothers who
reproduce sons -- renders them vulnerable to rape by
"inﬁdels."]{.underline} As Patricia Molloy (1999: 306) has noted, ["it
is through desire, \[understood as\] the self's relation with the Other,
that security is lived . . . \[W\]arfare functions as not only a
gendered, but a racialized practice of securing desire."]{.underline} An
unspoken logic ensues. [The more radical conservatives like bin Ladin
and the Taliban reduce women to little more than baby-breeders, the more
they need to war against a mythologized, rapist white-male West/
America.]{.underline}9 So much for bin Ladin's terrorism campaign veiled
as the path to "paradise." [A reverse logic operates as well. The more
the West and America demonize radical Islam as full of mythical
misogynists, the more they ﬁnd themselves compelled to "liberate" not
just women but whole societies. So much for Western/American colonialism
reframed as "secularization," "democratization," "regime change," and
"nation building."]{.underline}

#### Ontological security is a colonialist globalizing tactic, silencing other understandings of security, safety, and freedom which intervene into Western discourses.

Security as ontological security: a post-colonial approach,"

From human to ontological security? Richmond instead advocates [a
post-liberal human security which would build on existing institutional
capacities and processes but would be sensitised to 'local alterity,
resistance and accommodation, norms, customs, culture and identity, and
an international social contract as the basis for Human Security and
peacebuilding'.]{.underline} 48 Human Security, [thus, becomes a site of
contestation between the 'local' and the 'liberal'. This opens up the
possibility of the emergence of a 'post-colonial' from of Human Security
'capable of organizing hybrid understandings of security in relation to
the human subjects they produce and are constituted by rather than
falling back on the often empty securitization of western forms of
liberalism and realism'.]{.underline} However, Richmond appears to reify
the 'local' without taking into account how processes of [neo-colonial
governmentality construct the local as a space distinct from the
'global' or 'international'.]{.underline} [This makes a distinction
between the 'local' and the 'liberal' problematic. Indeed, 'liberal'
Human Security itself may be understood as a 'local' form of secularised
ethics particular to Western Europe]{.underline}. [By engaging with
other culturally embedded notions of security, 'liberal' Human Security
may allow us to engage with other forms of the 'local'.]{.underline}
**[But once its aspirations are universalised through the language of
protection and empowerment by the 'international community', it silences
other culturally mediated understandings of Human Security which are no
less 'universal' and resonate with 'everyday life', particularly in the
global South]{.underline}**. Instead, it is suggested here that a
'post-colonial' approach to Human Security may benefit from dialogic
engagement with post-secular thought, notwithstanding the Eurocentric
assumptions upon which conventional understandings of post-secularism
are based. For Jürgen Habermas, the term 'post-secular' refers to
societies where the continued existence of religious communities in an
increasingly secularised environment necessitates, on the one hand, the
inclusion of religious-based world views into the public sphere, and, on
the other, the translation of religious-based claims into secular terms
in order to guarantee the neutrality of the public sphere. Since [the
constitutional state is only able to guarantee its citizens equal
freedom on the basis of mutual recognition as members of a single
political community, all norms that can be legally implemented must be
formulated and publicly justified in a language that all the citizens
understand.]{.underline} Religious claims should, according to Habermas,
be permissible in the public sphere but barred entry into the
'institutionalized decision-making process' in order to guarantee the
principle of neutrality of the state towards competing worldviews.
Political decisions, therefore, need to be formulated and be justifiable
in a language intelligible to all citizens.50 [However, the translation
of faith-based claims into secular terms requires not only that they be
'privatised' but rendered intelligible to a specific 'religious'
tradition.]{.underline} As Talal Asad has persuasively argued, there can
be no transhistorical understanding of religion.51 [Asad sees the
emergence of 'religion' as inextricably linked to developments within
Christianity and particularly its relationship with political
power.]{.underline} Its genealogy in the Judaeo-Christian tradition
poses problems for the entry of minority religious and/or cultural
traditions into the public sphere, blurring the distinction between
'religious' and 'secular' claims. Secularism, as Asad52 and José
Casanova,53 among others, have pointed out, can only be understood with
reference to 'religion'. The 'secular' at one time was 'part of a
theological discourse (saeculum)' denoting the transition from a
monastic life to the life of canons. After the Reformation, it signified
the 'privatisation' of Church property, that is, its transfer to
laypersons and entry into market circulation. Finally, in the 'discourse
of modernity, the "secular" presents itself as the ground from which
theological discourse was generated ... and from which it gradually
emancipated itself in the mark to freedom'. 54 Consequently, the
secularisation of religious claims may require their insertion into an
ontotheological framework which may be alien to the adherents of a
particular 'faith'. It is suggested here that, instead of translating
faith-based claims into a secular language, an attempt should be made to
understand these claims in their own terms. Sensitised to cultural
difference, a post-secular understanding of human security should permit
the articulation of multiple claims deriving from different
religio-cultural traditions without prioritising any one 'tradition' as
having a monopoly over defining security.55 Implicit in this argument is
the assumption that culture and religion may act as important forms of
ontological security for the individual. This is not to suggest that
culture and religion can automatically provide security for individuals
through mere adherence to religious doctrine or routinised practices
which may correspond to 'tradition' 56 but that they are resources that
individuals can draw upon in times of rapid social and economic change.
If, to paraphrase Marx,57 individuals make their own identities but not
under conditions of their own choosing, culture and religion may act as
both preconditions for, and constraints on, the exercise of agency. They
can act as preconditions for the exercise of agency by providing a
stable cognitive environment for the individual to interact with others
and establish relations based on shared values or an ethical code which
may transcend what Charles Taylor refers to as the 'immanent frame'. 58
**[Equally, culture and religion can act as constraints on the exercise
of agency by restricting the scope for interaction with others whose
values are articulated in different conceptual languages.]{.underline}**
This restricts the range of resources which individuals can draw upon
when confronted by challenges which threaten established patterns of
behaviour or even the existence of the self. [Ontological security may
be understood, following Jennifer Mitzen, as 'the security of the self'.
59 A psychoanalytic term, the concept was introduced by R D Laing in his
book The Divided Self (1960). For Laing, to be ontologically secure is
to 'have a sense of ... presence in the world as a real, alive, whole,
and, in a temporal sense, a continuous person'.]{.underline} 60
Ontological security allows the individual to 'encounter all the hazards
of life' from a 'centrally firm sense' of his or her 'own and other
people's reality and identity'. [Without ontological security, the
individual will be overwhelmed by anxieties that reach to the very roots
of the individual's coherent sense of 'being in the world'.]{.underline}
61 [Laing identifies three forms of anxiety that threaten ontological
security: engulfment, implosion and petrification.62 Engulfment refers
to the sense of the loss of identity and autonomy which an ontologically
insecure individual experiences relating to others. Isolation is the
preferred strategy used to preserve the individual's identity from
engulfment.63 Implosion, on the other hand, refers to the 'terror' felt
by the individual as she/he experiences 'the world as liable at any
moment to crash in and obliterate all identity, as a gas will rush in
and obliterate a vacuum'.]{.underline} 64 [The individual is defined by
the emptiness she/he feels and 'reality' is experienced as implosive.
Finally, petrification refers to a particular form of terror experienced
whereby the individual is 'petrified', in the sense of being rendered an
'it without subjectivity'.]{.underline} 65 **[Depersonalisation is the
common strategy used to deal with the 'intrusive' other. The act of
turning the other into a 'thing' is, for the self,
petrifying.]{.underline}** Any other is a threat to the self by their
very existence, rather than what they may or may not do.66 [An
ontologically secure individual is able to act autonomously because s/he
has a stable sense of self and a 'biographical continuity' 67 which
allows her or him to act consistently with regard to future
relationships and experiences.]{.underline} Ontologically secure
individuals are able to exercise agency because of the existence of a
'protective cocoon' which shields them from the many threats to their
physical or psychological integrity.68 Giddens had argued that basic
trust is a 'protective cocoon which all normal individuals carry around
with them as the means whereby they are able to get on with the affairs
of day-to-day life' (emphasis in the original).69 [This protective
cocoon is a precondition for 'creativity': 'the capability to act or
think innovatively in relation to pre-established modes of
activity'.]{.underline} 70 Ontological security, for Giddens, resides in
the possession of '"answers" to fundamental existential questions which
all human life in some way addresses'. 71 [These existential questions
'concern the basic parameters of human life' and presume the following
ontological and epistemological elements:]{.underline} . Existence and
being: the nature of existence, the identity of objects and events. .
Finitude and human life: the existential contradiction by means of which
human beings are of nature yet set apart from it as sentient and
reflexive creatures. . The experience of others: how individuals
interpret the traits and actions of other individuals. . The continuity
of self-identity: the persistence of feelings of personhood in a
continuous self and body.72 Religious cosmologies, Giddens acknowledges,
may provide answers to these questions by providing the biographical
continuity necessary for the development of a stable self-identity. They
provide us with a sense of who we are, who we have become and where we
are going by developing conceptions of the afterlife or cycles of
rebirth which allow us to cope with the spectre of our own finitude.
Giddens argues that 'in virtually all rationalised religious systems,
explicit ontological conceptions are found'. 73 However, [the colonial
legacy continues to cast a shadow on the quest for ontological security
in the post-colonial world as will be discussed below with reference to
South Asia. Colonisation re-articulated local cosmological identities
into 'global' narratives of 'religion' and 'nation' which became
resources upon which post-colonial peoples could draw in their search
for ontological security.]{.underline} Identities, following the
Lacanian psychoanalytical tradition, come from the outside through a
process of identification. Jacques Lacan (1977) argued that they are
inherently 'fictional' constructs: [all identities are 'imaginary' based
on the fundamental misrecognition (méconnaisance) of the child with its
imago.]{.underline} 74 **[The ontological insecurity felt by many
post-colonial subjects results from this misrecognition with Eurocentric
categories causing a split in the 'self'.]{.underline}** This is best
illustrated in the work of Frantz Fanon, a contemporary of Lacan. In
Black Skins, White Masks (1952), [Fanon, accounted for the fragmentation
experienced by racialised, colonial subjects forced to put on 'white
masks' in order to integrate into a world not of their making**. The
promise of acceptance into white, colonial society elicits a desire to
assimilate but is continually deferred leading to a profound sense of
humiliation, anxiety and (ontological) insecurity. '**]{.underline}The
colonized', in Fanon's words, is 'elevated above his jungle status in
proportion to his adoption of the mother country's cultural standards'
yet is unable to be accepted due to her/his 'black skins'. 75
Consequently, the racialised (post) colonial subject is, in Homi
Bhabha's words, 'almost the same but not quite'. 76 [However, in many
parts of the post-colonial world, this fragmentation of the 'self' is
not necessarily expressed in terms of inferiority but difference from
the West.]{.underline}77 [The West, however, continues to profoundly
influence the psychic structures of post-colonial subjectivity even when
it appears absent, representing an idealised 'mirror' through which
post-colonial subjectivity is (mistakenly) constituted.]{.underline}

#### The House of IR collapses ontology with geography through marking certain areas as "spaces of death" that become justifyiable for killing. This occurs through a risk management that uses the protection of human rights in order to destroy anticipation anticipated threats to preserve a flourishing white community

University. "From Threat To Walking Corpse: Spatial Disruption and the
Phenomonology of 'Living Under Drones'". Theory and Event, Volume 21,
Number 2. //lilith)

[Affect---in the form of fear]{.underline}---here plays a double
function: it [both anticipates future threats and produces the very
threat that triggers this fearful anticipation.]{.underline} [By
reorienting the political, pragmatist use of fear]{.underline}
characteristic of Hobbesian or Machiavellian sovereignty [toward the
production of an indefinite field of virtual threat]{.underline} as
such, [the US has adopted an affective geopolitics which works to
actively produce objects of threat while still maintaining the concept
of 'terror' as an indeterminately possible and thus]{.underline},
[inexhaustible space of threat]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
indeterminacy [engender]{.underline}s what Louis Amoore terms a
"[politics of possibility" wherein risk management comes to define state
governance, both domestic and international, and concomitantly generates
secure and unsecure 'spaces'---those which mark future safety and future
threat, respectively---neither of which, crucially, exist in the
present]{.underline}. Much like Brian Massumi does, however, Amoore
argues that [the performance of risk management itself "produces the
effects that it names"5 and thus allows the State to address, manage, or
exterminate them as required]{.underline}. [Under the logic of risk
management]{.underline}, the production of secure and unsecure spaces
both anticipates and necessitates [a new military approach to fighting
the 'War on Terror]{.underline}.' The emergent, [preventive military
paradigm works by ontologizing all persons in spaces of threat as
targets that can be justifiably eliminated in the name of national
security]{.underline}. Within this schema of risk production and
prevention, [the subjects living]{.underline} under and within the space
of death---exemplified, as we will see, by the 'drone zone'---[become
reduced to the status of 'walking corpses.']{.underline} It is this
ontologization that I am concerned with here, not only because it
profoundly undermines the strike zone inhabitants' beings-in-the-world,
but more importantly because it is often overlooked and, indeed,
neglected in increasingly quantified and apodictic discourses on ethics
and war. Indeed, as put by Sam Opondo and Michael Shapiro, "[the modern
discourse on war seeks to efface the suffering it brings about by
focusing more on the forces of war---its objectives, images of
weapons]{.underline} [(and uniformed soldiers) and logistical
issues---rather than the flex and the spaces that disintegrate in their
encounter with these forces]{.underline}."6 I begin by rearticulating
the notion of being-in-the-world as one of situational spatiality before
introducing a "phenomenology of space" as that which constitutes one's
body schema and concomitant lived experience. This is made evident, I
suggest, in the racialized ontology forced upon and unwittingly adopted
by subjects occupying certain spaces. As such, I reorient 'race' as a
signifier applied not to bodies per se, but to spaces from which certain
bodies are presumed to have emerged, a data point among an assemblage of
characteristics used to locate and identify supposed 'threats.' By
conceptualizing race in this way, we can account for the tactical shift
from bodies of threat to spaces of threat and the concomitant
ontologization of bodies both in and from these spaces as targets. This
tactical shift, I show, is both produced by and a feature of US
self-preservation in the face of spatial disruption. In accordance with
this shift, [armed drones have been developed to intercept
threat-producing spaces rather than discrete bodies such that potential,
future agents of threat can be preventively eliminated.]{.underline}
However, the result of this military paradigm paradoxically [requires
that those living under 'drone zones' experience their own unique and
undertheorized spatial disruption]{.underline}. It is the standpoint of
these supposed 'targets' with which I conclude this analysis, exposing
how they have been reduced to the status of 'walking corpses' [whose
disrupted relations to space acutely compromise their phenomenological
and existential beings-in-the-world]{.underline}. Maurice Merleau-Ponty
lays the foundation for this analysis, not only because his theories of
perception and experience have found renewed application in contemporary
issues of race, recognition theory, and politics, but also for the
implicit rejection of the Enlightenment conceptualization of liberal man
as the rational, self-contained animal embedded therein. In his
phenomenological assessment of space, David Morris criticizes this
limitizing ontology by reframing man as a process, "a moving being who
crosses limits" and "signals something that is there before us that can
be neither encompassed nor sealed off."7 Objective space---the
antithesis to the phenomenological 'horizon' that Merleau-Ponty develops
in The Phenomenology of Perception and which is taken for granted in the
Enlightenment schema---"abstracts from all places and things by claiming
space as something present all at once without movement in it"8 and
thereby erases experiential differences accompanying alterations in or
variances between agents' relations to space. For Morris and others,
Merleau-Ponty's project both stresses "the irreducibility of lived
experience to the acts of a constituting consciousness"9 and offers an
ontology by which we may reintegrate figures who have historically been
excluded from philosophical scholarship and which, in fact, can
centralize them as subjects of experience in their own right. As such,
though I utilize a phenomenological framework in order to establish the
'drone zone' as a 'space of death,' this article is in many ways an
appraisal of and meditation on political ontology more broadly. Finally,
I in no way mean to speak on behalf of those persons living in the
'death spaces' laid out in this analysis---least of all ontologize them
as passive objects of suffering, as so much literature on ethics and war
often do---but rather reorient scholarship on targets of US state
violence from quantified units or "collateral damage" to agents who
themselves wield tools of political, ethical, and philosophical
critique. This is a strategy which has already been taken up in earnest
by contemporary critical race theorists, post-colonial theorists, and
queer and feminist theorists through such methodologies as standpoint
theory, existential phenomenology, and social epistemology, but it is
still lacking in much of the growing scholarship on war, statelessness,
and sovereign violence which continues to rely on abstract theories of
ethics, relationality, and hospitality. To this end, I draw on
testimonies of drone strike survivors and 'drone zone' inhabitants as a
means of exploring the reciprocity of the phenomenology of the 'death
space' and the lived experiences of those who dwell therein, with the
aim of re-humanizing the drone project and opening pathways for new
analyses and problematizations of drone warfare. Constitution of Space,
Constitution by Space Challenging the intellectualist and physicalist
conceptualizations of man, Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological
project reframes the "I" as, not consciousness simplicter, but
consciousness that is always already embodied: I live in a reciprocal
relation with the world wherein it presses upon me and I in turn imbue
it with meaning. My body, in other words, is me as I exist in the world,
insofar as I am a beingin-the-world who lives through a body which is
intentional, oriented toward, and interacting with the external.
Existence itself "designates the movement by which the body" gives and
makes sense, grasped, according to Renaud Barbaras, as the very
"facticity" of man.10 The 386 Theory & Event world in which my body is
animate, then, is not a world void of meaning or content, but rather a
world which I perceive and constantly reproduce in particular ways,
distinct from the perceived worlds of others. For the embodied
being-in-the-world, Merleau-Ponty defines the body schema as that which
produces a posture within the "inter-sensory world" (what I am calling
the 'perceived world') wherein the spatiality of my body---its "posture
toward a certain task"---is always a situational spatiality.11 "The body
schema is not merely an experience of my body," Merleau-Ponty writes,
"but rather an experience of my body in the world."12 Against the
Cartesian understanding of space as objective, isotropic extension,
Merleau-Ponty rearticulates bodily movement and intentional action
within space as a "practical system" that is mutually constituting of
body and space. In other words, I am both constituted by the world and
constitute the world---I am not a body in space and time, but a body of
space and time13---and just as I live through the body, the space which
I inhabit is a lived space. The body schema is the constellation of
bodily and behavioral habits that expresses "the power we have of
dilating our being in the world"14 and allows us to navigate different
spaces in ways that reflect our unique (and often socially-constructed)
positionalities. It is not mere motricity that shapes and is shaped by
our lived worlds, however, but our entire consciousness within them,
including intentional interactions with objects therein. Crucial to
Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological system is the existence of other
bodies---other embodied consciousnesses---as fundamental components of
an agent's perceived world. Indeed, it is due precisely to the existence
of others that my perceived world is always being challenged and
reshaped. According to Barbaras, "the other from the start informs the
prescription of the perceived world"15 such that it "manifests itself to
me as what is immediately accessible to others."16 However, our
comportments in these perceived worlds are not identical with others',
even if inescapably affected or guided by them. Unlike the external
viewpoint framing behaviorist theories of action, there exists "an
internal viewpoint, that of the observer who lives and understands the
behavior."17 David Morris, for whom confrontation with others cannot be
divorced from the spaces in which those confrontations take place,
characterizes perception as "inherently situational and active," wherein
"perceiver and perceived cross and infiltrate each other, and this
crossing already constitutes a field of perception in which the
perceived already has a meaning for the perceiver."18 Building on the
above conceptualizations, I want to suggest that what can be said of
intersubjective interactions can also be said of our interactions with
spaces themselves. For phenomenologist Matthew Ratcliff, "interaction
with \[a\] person makes one feel a certain way,"19 indicating that our
intersubjective experiences with others shape the modal possibilities we
perceive in these interpersonal contexts: the way I interact with an
employer (formal, polite), for example, is likely distinct from the way
I interact with my sister (casual, unselfconscious). Similarly, our
interactions with particular spatiotemporal situations can and do shape
our psychophysical comportments within these spaces: as a female, the
manner in which I walk downtown during a busy day (headphones in, paying
little mind to my surroundings), will likely be different from the
manner in which I walk downtown at night (more alert, shoulders squared,
attuned to sudden motions and sounds), even if no other bodies occupy by
perceptual field. The spaces in which I live and move, in other words,
are spaces that are already overlain with existential meanings with
which I (and others) constitute them, and my intentional actions and
habits in these spaces are implicit responses and adaptations to these
meanings. Accordingly, my perceptual field---or the indeterminate
horizon which allows objects to come into focus---encompasses a set of
background assumptions that make these objects intelligible in ways
particular to me, reflected in my experiences of and behaviors within
them. Liu Shengli, drawing from the Phenomenology of Perception,
reframes 'space' as the foundation upon which Merleau-Ponty's entire
phenomenological project rests. The "primordial" world, on this account,
is the pre-cognitive, pre-reflective world upon which we have a
'natural' perceptual grasp. We can interpret the 'primordial' world as
the emergent spatial context of Edmund Husserl's epoché---
phenomenological reduction---or that which stands once we bracket all
background assumptions and judgments from embodied experience.20 It is
this primordial world which grounds the unity of lived, human
experiences, insofar as this primordial spatiality "originates from the
pre-conscious hold of our body as a natural subject on a natural
world."21 [Primordial spatiality accordingly underlies individuated,
embodied experiences of inhabited space, and the primordial field we
might understand as the absolute indeterminacy of possibility at the
background of all of our (specific) interactions with and within the
worlds of our lived experience]{.underline}. The lived world,
however---that which Merleau-Ponty sometimes calls (and which I have
been calling) the "perceived world"---brings with it its own range of
existential possibilities, and these are the possibilities that
constitute my being-in-theworld and are concomitantly constituted by it.
As Shengli notes, [the communicative relation between the lived body as
consciousness and the perceived world is not an external relation, but
an internal relation of reciprocal constitution]{.underline}. In other
words, this relation should inhere in the essential nature of the two
related terms so that they are essentially defined in its correlation.22
388 Theory & Event In the same vein, Merleau-Ponty credits the "double
function" of the body for generating the dual manifestations of the
world as primordial (or natural) and as perceived (or lived): Knowledge
and communication sublimate rather than suppress our incarnation, and
the characteristic operation of the mind is in the movement by which we
recapture our corporeal existence and use it to symbolize instead of
merely to co-exist. This metamorphosis lies in the double function of
our body. Through its 'sensory fields' and its whole organization the
body is, so to speak, predestined to model itself on the natural aspects
of the world. But as an active body capable of gestures, of expression,
and finally of language, it turns back on the world to signify it.23
Taking together both Mearleau-Ponty's and Shengli's accounts, I offer a
conceptualization of the body-world relationship as the following:
insofar as I live in the primordial world, I inhabit an existential
world characterized by an "internal relation" of existential reciprocity
that shapes my motricity and experiences therein. Just as there exists a
primordial field that frames my inhabited world, so too does there
exist, then, an existential field from which emerges possibilities of
action that are particular to me. We might consider Matthew Ratcliffe's
characterization of the horizon---as that which "incorporates a
harmonious web of salient possibilities for perception and
action"24---in this regard. My existential horizon, as such, constitutes
background assumptions adopted through my lived experiences and
generates a collection of possibilities for meaningful interpretation
and action unique to my lived world. Crucially, it is this field of
possibilities and my capacity to bring them into actualization that
constitutes my freedom. As Merleau-Ponty states, "freedom must have a
field: that is, it must have some privileged possibilities or realities
that tend to be preserved in being."25 Under this schema, one's degree
of freedom is constituted by the scope of one's existential horizon of
possibility, and likewise, one's existential horizon also indicates
one's level of unfreedom. When framed in the context of concreate
intercorporeal interactions, existentiality may be understood more
determinately as sociopoliticality, with degrees of freedom and
unfreedom predicated on the material possibilities for action available
to different subjects. These, of course, are products of social
construction, normalization, and objectivation---what Peter Berger and
Thomas Luckmann would call 'reification' through which "the world of
institutions appears to merge with the world of nature"26 and in which
'legitimation' "justifies the institutional order by giving a normative
dignity to its practical imperatives"27---and hence variable across time
and space. For example, although I---a South Asian woman---and my
colleague---a Caucasian man---inhabit the same academic space, the
existential horizon of my unique being-in-the-academic-world is
radically distinct from his once we take into account the historic,
sociopolitical elements of the American academy that epistemically and
professionally privilege certain bodies over and against others. We
cannot speak and move in the same ways precisely because we do not
inhabit the same sociopolitical world. We are, as Merleau-Ponty
describes the intercorporeal encounter with the Other, "like two nearly
concentric circles which can be distinguished only by a slight and
mysterious slippage."28 It is through our bodies that "we belong to
relatively different worlds, with different forms of visibility and
invisibility,"29 and the differences between us lies in the differences
of live possibilities that exist in our specific, but interlocking and
sometimes overlapping, sociopolitical horizons. In the phenomenology of
space that I am laying out, [economies of fear work to preserve spaces
as belonging to certain bodies rather than others by creating
determinate threats that must then be contained or eliminated. Objects
of fear---that which I call 'threats'---are intimately connected to the
possibility of spatial disruption insofar as those objects press upon us
"an anticipated pain in the future]{.underline}."30 In the context of
the United States, this future pain can most simply be characterized by
the shattered stability of the white world, insofar as this is a
stability predicated upon a hyperprotected and policed space for the
(white) bodies that fear.31 Just as communities require strangers to
establish their borders, Sara Ahmed notes that [fear concomitantly
"makes these borders by establishing objects from which the subject, in
fearing, can flee]{.underline}."32 Drawing on Ahmed's account, Jasbir
Puar observes how "[the materialization of the feared body occurs
through a visual racial regime as well as the impossibility of the
containment of feared bodies,"33 which in the United States has
historically been applied to the black body and has cultivated a
widespread culture of policing, incarceration, and, increasingly, murder
in the name of 'law enforcement.]{.underline}' However, the terrorist
attacks of September 11 generated a new class of 'threat,' "a new
identity category that groups together persons who appear 'Middle
Eastern, Arab, or Muslim'"34 that has been seamlessly incorporated into
already-existing institutions of racialized subjugation. Here, "Muslim"
is used as a racial signifier rather than one of religious affiliation,
and together with 'Middle Eastern' and 'Arab' reflects what Leti Volpp
calls "a racialization wherein members of this group are identified as
terrorists, and disidentified as citizens."35 **[By invoking the
'terrorist]{.underline}**,' in other words[**, the State is able to
identify which bodies are threats to be surveilled, deported, and/or
interned to ensure the flourishing of the 'white'
community**.]{.underline} 390 The operative value of race in Ahmed's,
Puar's, and Volpp's writings clearly reflect Michel Foucault's
characterization of biopolitics as a structure "bound up with the
workings of a State that is obliged to use race, the elimination of race
and the purification of race, to exercise its sovereign power."36
However, for Foucault race operates not in terms of the "racial
epidermal schema" of Frantz Fanon's writings,37 but instead as a tool by
which the State demarcates certain populations socio-spatially, wherein
technologies of discipline function as "a type of location of bodies in
space, of distribution of individuals in relation to one another, of
hierarchical organization, of disposition of centers and channels of
power, of definition of the instruments and modes of intervention of
power."38 This characterization reappears in Security, Territory,
Population where Foucault writes that discipline structures a space and
addresses the essential problem of a hierarchical and functional
distribution of elements, and security will try to plan a milieu in
terms of events or series of events or possible elements, of series that
will have to be regulated within a multivalent and transformable
framework.39 [The sovereign thus holds "the capacity to define who
matters and who does not, who is disposable and who is
not]{.underline},"40 in way that racializes both bodies and spaces such
that fear itself becomes structurally linked to both bodies and spaces.
In the case of blackness, we find that this is manifested both in terms
of the black body---insofar as, for example, black men are
disproportionately subject to police violence---as well as what are
often interpreted as 'black' spaces---such as institutionally
impoverished urban areas where pervasive police presence is viewed as a
public safety necessity. In this theory of racialized spaces, Frantz
Fanon's analysis remains useful insofar as it dispels the myth of
classical phenomenology's conceptualization of the 'body schema' by
exposing its inability to account for the comportment of the black body
in the 'white world.' Under the sociopolitical and economic dominance of
the white man who "unmercifully imprison\[s\]" him, Fanon observes that
[the sedimentation of racial hierarchy leads to a self-objectification,
a development of his own body schema under the authority of the other:
the existential horizon of the black body, according to Fanon, is
situated in a space of white authority that limits the black subject's
existential possibilities and subsequent degree of freedom.]{.underline}
Amidst the interplay between bodies and spaces, Fanon shows us how
bodies are used to demarcate spaces in such a way that different
existential horizons are generated for different 'types' of bodies. Sara
Ahmed articulates this phenomenon of spaces for bodies by contrasting
the inhabitant (of a space) with the stranger (who is out-of-place in
that space): "[Others are recognized as strangers by those who inhabit a
given space,]{.underline}" Ahmed writes, and "who 'make it' their
own."41 If we take 'space' as a field through which we constitute
ourselves psychologically as well as phenomenologically, then
[disturbances of space directly affect our conscious movements within
them while demarcated spaces produce different horizons of possibility
for different bodies therein.]{.underline} The duality of the body/space
nexus is historically rooted in what Sam Opondo and Michael Shapiro call
"institutionalized or power-invested cartographic practices" which
present regulative ideals predicated on notions of the 'right'
relationships between bodies, spaces and times. They also 'police' and
reproduce regimes for the 'distribution of bodies into functions' and
determine what bodies are recognizable and what they can and cannot do
within the spaces and times they occupy.42 From these cartographic
practices emerged certain moral, economic, and political logics that
historically guided imperialism and colonialism, but which have over
time transformed with the advent of advanced cartographic technologies
(among which the drone, as we will see, is crucial), geopolitical
developments, and changing state interests. On a contemporary global
scale---in a world where the individual sovereignty of nation-states is
protected above all else---the perception of bodies as objects of fear
generates 'threats' which "align bodies with and against others"43 and
simultaneously reinforces what Jürgen Habermas calls the
"ethnonationalist" essence of the nationstate (or the notion of a
perceived 'ethnic community' for whom the State is intended).44 Jasbir
Puar reframes this idea as political exceptionalism reinforced through
the production of certain narratives: [in the United
States,]{.underline} she writes, "[exceptionalism gestures to narratives
of excellence, excellent nationalism, a process whereby a national
population comes to believe in its own superiority and its own
singularity,]{.underline} 'stuck,' as Sara Ahmed would say[, to various
subjects."]{.underline}45 On Ahmed's own account, [the 'nation' is
interpreted as an 'imagined community' which must be "constantly
renegotiated, and that negotiation is crucially dependent on
encountering those who are recognizable as strangers, and who demand a
response from the citizen]{.underline}."46 The negotiations that sustain
the national imaginary often operate in response to cross-cultural or
transnational events---such as war or immigration--- and are, as such,
contingently structured. Post-9/11, a new vision of "America" emerged
which synonymized 'Americanness' with liberal values such as,
principally, 'freedom,' which could operate politically and militarily
only by offering 'terrorism' as its antagonist: '[We' Americans are
defined by our freedom, and terrorism is that which aims to destroy what
'we' are. But just as the 'nation' is contingent upon social and
political developments, so, too, is the body that constitutes the 'we'
of the nation:]{.underline} the production of nations constitutes
individuals as belonging to the nation: the work of 'the nation' is done
as much through the everyday encounters in public life, as it is done
through the political machinery of the nation-state. But [the production
of the nation also involves imagining the nation space]{.underline}...
The construction of the nation space takes place alongside the
production of national character as instances in which 'the nation'
itself is fleshed out as place and person. [47 **Once there exists a
global currency of fear**]{.underline}---such as the one we see
today---**[the biopolitical jurisdiction of the State extends beyond its
own borders: because threats to the 'home' can emerge from afar, the
logic of risk management justifies the State's power to racialize,
categorize, and demarcate the bodies in these faraway spaces of
threat.]{.underline}** As Louis Amoore writes, The question of the
designation of categories of citizen, alien, asylum seeker, refugee,
legal or illegal migrant worker, for example, is not a matter of
excluding what is supposedly alien, illegal, illegitimate per se but of
taking them outside, rendering them as other so that their lives and
bodies can be included within governable space.4 [In the United States'
growing]{.underline} [global, biopolitical regime, the value of
bodies]{.underline} (whether they exist or not)
[is]{.underline}---following [a complex history of indigenous genocide,
slavery, racialized socioeconomic practices, and totalizing
globalization---preemptively determined by their perceived spaces of
origin]{.underline}, reflected by such identifying markers as skin
color, religious affiliation, and even name. It is within the framework
of spatial compartmentalization that the 'space of death' emerges. For
Sam Opondo, "[spaces of death" designate spaces "imbued with moral
values that manifest themselves in the incongruous treatment of
violence"---often grounded in "Christian, colonial, nation-statist or
neo-liberal" logics of statecraft---that concomitantly legitimize
certain uses of force as strategically or ethically
"necessary]{.underline}."49 Under this framework, [the geopolitical
compartmentalization of threatening spatial 'units' serves to justify
violent actions committed therein, deployed in the service of a
"biopolitics of humanity]{.underline}"50 [that aims to 'secure' the
health and safety of non-threatening bodies]{.underline}.51 Opondo
characterizes the "space of death" as the nexus which cultivates and is
[cultivated by a "humanitarian ethos"---disallowing life for some as a
means of preserving life for others, framed always through a discourse
of ethics of global humanity rather than one of onto-theologized
capitalist practices---wherein "some of the 'live-saving' measures
deployed in spaces of death are in themselves imbued with 'forces of
death.]{.underline}'"52 We might [think]{.underline} of the United
States' rationalization of the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan as a
campaign to 'liberate' women oppressed under Taliban rule as an example
of the humanitarian ethos at work, utilizing a narrative which was
distributed with great optimism in the early years of the War on Terror
and helped to [legitimize America's promise "to stay in Afghanistan and
foster security, economic development, and human rights for
all]{.underline}."53 Just as the reification of affect into bodies of
threat is guided by narratives of US exceptionalism, [liberal values are
invoked as a justifying force in military intervention; the pure and
democratic veneer, as always, masks the exploitative and imperialist
reality.]{.underline} For Opondo, the notion of the 'space of death'
helps us to problematize one of the many logics of statecraft that the
US has employed in its imperial project of 'global policing.' His
cartographic analysis wonderfully captures the evolution of Foucauldian
biopolitics---[that which constantly seeks to compartmentalize,
discipline, manage, and control---from a statist technique of governance
to one that disregards traditional geopolitical borders, while still
remaining sensitive to the affective forces of this global biopolitical
logic]{.underline}. Nonetheless, its perspective is predominantly
Western and paints the US as the ontologizing author of geopolitics---
["administering death or life by 'collapsing ontology with
geography'"]{.underline}54---without engaging with particular
technologies of identification and categorization (what Foucault might
call disciplinary technologies) that themselves make possible this
biopolitical management of bodies in space. Such an exploration,
however, is necessary if we are to expand the scope of analysis to these
spatio-situated bodies themselves, and it is to this task that we now
turn.

## 2AC A2 (classical) LIBERALISM -- DEFINITIONS OF WAR

#### Liberal definitions of warfare allow for civilian slaughter. The US creates classifications like "enemy combatant: and "militants" in order to mark groups for death. Only the critical geopolitics of the aff is capable of intervening into these violent imaginaries.

**Ahmed 18** (Sabeen, not Sarah. PhD in Philosophy from Vanderbilt
University. "From Threat To Walking Corpse: Spatial Disruption and the
Phenomonology of 'Living Under Drones'". Theory and Event, Volume 21,
Number 2. //lilith)

[Although Pakistan has been the site of most drone strikes]{.underline},
[Yemen and Somalia]{.underline} have also come under the jurisdiction of
American militarism, and [inhabitants thereof have "become part of a
targeted class simply because they live and move in areas in which
terror suspects may operate,]{.underline}" in line with [the United
States' liberal identification of 'militants' and 'insurgents' in its
self-titled "non-international armed conflict]{.underline}": "the US
counts all killed adult males as 'combatants,' absent exonerating
evidence. In other words, [claims that drones have killed hundreds of
low-level fighters may well mask the deaths of civilians]{.underline}."
[The spatial indeterminacy of the very zone of conflict has thus allowed
for the utilization of subject ambiguity as a means of producing
threatening figures]{.underline}---a rather perverse take on the
'sovereign decision'--- and thereby [fulfilling]{.underline} Amoore's
[criteria for risk management as well as providing subjects upon which
this new biopolitics of war can operate]{.underline}. Much can be said
about the newfound ethical, legal, and political complexities generated
by drone warfare, in light of the topic becoming increasingly relevant
for just war theorists, political philosophers, and ethicists.84 [Even
prior to the use of the drone]{.underline}, however, Sam Opondo notes
that "[humanistic discourse and changing definitions of warfare are
predicated on cultural and geographical assumptions]{.underline}" [that
privilege Western notions of the ethical and unethical, just and unjust,
and secure and insecure.]{.underline}85 **[Space itself has become a
tool for legitimizing State violence, and the visual indeterminacy of
subjects only amplifies the biopolitical logic of risk management by
abstracting the subject from her very body]{.underline}**: all persons
living in drone zones become potential conduits of threat, while their
(blurred) bodies have been transformed into imminent targets, red dots
trapped in the crosshairs. Grégoire Chamayou elegantly chronicles the
history of the drone as one of "an eye turned into a weapon,"86 an
airborne panopticon that has drastically redefined not only military
relation to space, but also the very contours of warfare from a clash
between combatants to "a campaign of what is, quite simply,
slaughter."87 [Accompanying this redefinition is the shattering of
once-traditional norms of warfare]{.underline} (particularly that of
mutual risk) and its subsequent transformation into a new norm of
profound asymmetry which falls both outside of the morality of warfare
and inside the paradigm of policing in which "[the distinction between
combatants and noncombatants loses its value for moral
discrimination]{.underline}."88 The hostile zone, under the model of
policing, "remains a space that is left derelict but which, as a
potentially threatening area, definitely needs to be kept under
surveillance"89---much like the United [States' policing of 'urban'
populations as a means of surveilling black bodies and preserving the
security of the white hegemony.]{.underline}90 The consequence of this
topographic categorization on those living in drone zones, as we will
now see, is that [these subjects become]{.underline}, in the words of
Frantz Fanon, "[overdetermined from without," slaves "not of the 'idea'
that others have of \[them\] but of \[their\] own appearance,"91 and
brings with it a new phenomenology of the walking corpse.]{.underline}

## 2AC -- INTERNATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY BAD

#### Transnational governments function through de/reterritorializing space and capturing thought in order to maintain the monopoly on the proper use of violence. This process is replicated in "petty sovereigns" through American and liberal institutional support.

"PEACEKEEPING" AS OCCUPATION: MANAGING THE MARKET FOR VIOLENT LABOR IN
SOMALIA. //lilith)

[To understand the nature of transnational governance, we need to study
the daily micropractices of its]{.underline} political, military,
corporate, and administrative [actors]{.underline}---who Butler (2006)
might refer to [as "petty sovereigns."]{.underline} [The United Nations
and regional bodies]{.underline} like the African Union, among others,
[sit at the heart of these practices: the actors employed by these
institutions work to produce information, law, and procedure to channel
attention to particular issues in particular ways, while crafting
imaginaries of global governance as a moral and democratic
sphere]{.underline} (Clarke 2009; Malkki 1994). From security sector
reform trainings, to "standard operating procedures" about the treatment
of detainees, to "civilian casualty tracking and analysis," I suggest
that [the peacekeeping operation in Somalia offers initial insights into
the relationship between transnational governance and the making of
security states]{.underline}. THE MARKET FOR VIOLENCE In The War
Machines: Young Men and Violence in Sierra Leone and Liberia (2011),
Danny Hoffman suggests that [we think of violence as a mode of
work]{.underline}. As he explores the conscription of urban youth into
disposable reserve armies in West Africa, Hoffman turns to Mbembe's
(2003) notion of "necropolitics": [sovereign authority in Africa today
consists of the instrumentalization and material destruction of human
bodies and in the exercise of power outside the law]{.underline}.
[Violent authority on the continent rests not with states alone but with
a range of actors: from transnational mining companies, to private
security, to rag-tag militias, and at times, the state
itself]{.underline}. Military manpower is bought and sold in an
increasingly competitive market permeated by fear and insecurity, both
real and perceived. In this context, politics in Africa today is,
according to Hoffman, "not the rational exercise of collective decision
making through institutions in the public sphere" (Hoffman 2011), but
the power and means to determine who may live or die (Agamben 1998).
Yet[, building on Deleuze and Guattari]{.underline}, Hoffman also points
to the fact that[, as states work to retain sovereignty in the face of
deterritorialized acts of violence, they necessarily draw upon not only
other deterritorializing forces but also upon territorialized actors
like NGOs and international organizations]{.underline} (Deleuze and
Guattari 1987; see also Reid 2005; Duffield 2007). As the "[war on
terror" expands across the African continent, these institutions are
assuming key roles in legitimizing the deployment of newly militarized
sociopolitical formations in the name of peace and
security]{.underline}. A closer look at [the relationship between the
"who" and the "how" of brokering certain forms of violent labor can
therefore shed light on the entanglement of rule of law, state building,
and security sector reform projects in transnational economies of
violence and militarization]{.underline}. The parliamentarian I spoke to
may not have had many details on his military's role in Somalia, but he
was fully aware of the ways in which a range of elite interests worked
to represent their presence as vital to national, regional, and
international security, making possible the movement of troops, arms,
and capital to occupy designated "security vacuums" inside Somalia.
AMISOM In December 2006, 50,000 U.S.-backed Ethiopian troops invaded
Somalia with the declared intention of unseating the Islamic Courts
Union---the first stable government Somalia had seen in years (Hagmann
and Hoehne 2009; Lindley 2010; Williams 2013; Scahill 2013). Despite the
illegality of the Ethiopian intervention and the ensuing loss of life,
the UN Security Council discouraged their immediate withdrawal, amending
a 1992 arms embargo to allow the supply of arms, training, and military
assistance for a planned African-led peacekeeping mission to Somalia.4
In just one document, (Security Council Resolution 1744), the UN
simultaneously affirmed its respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Somalia and rendered legal the illegal presence of foreign
troops.5 Formally operated by the African Union, AMISOM was launched in
January 2007 and mandated to support dialog and reconciliation; to
protect the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and assist in the
re-establishment of the national Somali security forces; to provide
security for key infrastructure, the repatriation of refugees and IDPs,
and the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Noticeably absent was a
mandate to protect civilians (Williams 2013). AMISOM is now staffed by
22,000 armed personnel (roughly equal in number to the UN peacekeeping
mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo), but its physical presence
is limited mainly to urban areas. Because the troops come entirely from
African states (Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sierra Leone,
Uganda), the UN and African Union tout the operation as an example of
enhanced governing capacities on the continent. Yet, the involvement of
a range of external actors complicates this projected imagery to reflect
what is referred to as "international hybridity par excellence." With an
approximate annual budget of \$700 million, the United States, UN,
European Union, NATO, China, Turkey, Qatar, and Pakistan provide funds
for arms, "logistical" materials, trainings, maritime security, and
salaries for troops.6 It is the injection of transnational funds that
makes this market for violent labor especially attractive for African
nationals, as troops are promised monthly wages that dwarf the salaries
of most national armies---including that of Somalia itself.7
Transnational funds also pay the salaries of governance professionals
who remain relatively invisible in contrast to the African troops that
constitute the operation's public face. These petty sovereigns
constitute a class of elite cosmopolitan actors whose liberal
sensibilities ensure continued mobility and access to institutions of
power and capital (Clarke 2009; Englund 2006; Ferguson 2006; Galtung
1986). Operating in securitized enclaves in Mogadishu, Nairobi, and New
York, they are employed by the UN Support Office for AMISOM, the Joint
Security Committee, the Joint Financial Management Board, the Technical
Selection Committee, the National Security and Stabilization Plan, the
Somali Reconstruction and Development Plan, the International Contact
Group on Somalia, the UN Trust Fund for AMISOM, the African Peace
Support Operations, the AU commission for African Peace Facility, the UN
Monitoring Group on Somalia, and the Restructuring and Rebuilding Fund
for Somali Security Sector Reform. The list is endless, but significant:
it is [this dizzying web of committees, commissions, and support offices
that connects the "who" with the "how" of transnational governance and
violent labor, as dozens of bureaucrats work to codify and legitimize
the movement of money, arms, and troops into specific
spaces]{.underline}. BUILDING CAPACITIES, BUILDING STATES One aspect of
this work includes the rationalization and funding of "capacity
building" programs to strengthen and reform the Somali national security
forces. With contracts from troop-contributing states (who obtain the
necessary funds from donor governments), [U.S. military officers and the
private security firm Dyncorp train Ugandan troops in Kampala prior to
their deployment to Somalia]{.underline}; Bancroft Global conducts
further trainings of the Ugandan and Burundian troops in Somalia.
Ugandan troops then train Somalis, but the Somalis also fly to Kigali
and Djibouti City for (re)-training by Rwandan and Djiboutian forces,
who themselves are trained by U.S. or private security actors. [Between
the U.S. State Department's ACOTA program and the Defense Department's
Africa Command (AFIRCOM), the United States has been a key player,
providing over \$355 million in "specialized counterterrorism training
and equipment," including unmanned drones.]{.underline}8 **[Inherent in
the liberal commitment to "strengthen" states is an investment in
building their capacity for violence.]{.underline}** As Ralph (N.d.)
observes, the graduation ceremonies for security actors constitute
ritual acts that "confer privileged moral standing in a Christian
genealogy of sanction" (Ralph, N.d. 204). AMISOM celebrates the
graduates of its training programs accordingly: The 1071 men and women
of the SPF (Somali Police Force) successfully finished the course which
was conducted by AMISOM Police Trainers. The training included Rescue
Operations and dealing with kidnappings, VIP protection exercise, riot
and crowd control, handcuffing, and the use of tear gas. The acquired
training will help fill a key gap in the Somali Police Force
capabilities, after years of civil war and armed conflict, while at the
same time, increase the SPF's ability to enforce the rule of law and
protect the communities they serve.9 With new trainees now back in
Mogadishu and widely deployed across the capital, the Somali Police
Force focus highly on maintaining security and building law and order
building law and order throughout Mogadishu. Night and day police
patrols as well as vigorous stop and search procedures in many parts of
the fragile city have changed the lives of local citizens, letting
people walk freely at night without fear of crime.10 These captions are
[the product of the daily work of bureaucratic officials whose
portfolios require that they articulate a symbiotic relationship between
freedom and the policing of the everyday: they are tasked with crafting
particular understandings of law and order]{.underline} (that it
requires a large police presence), [of security]{.underline} (that it
requires "crowd control" and stop and search procedures), [and of the
Somali people]{.underline} (that they require external tutelage to live
"freely"). At the same time, [these materials illustrate the role of
petty sovereigns in the]{.underline} (often farcical) [production of
state sovereignty, as the Somali Police Force performs for the camera
its budding authority over the use of force]{.underline} (Allen
2013:152). It is to this bureaucratic aspect of the market for violent
labor that we now turn. BUREAUCRACY AND THE MANAGEMENT OF VIOLENCE [As
peacekeepers move from one site to another for trainings and frontline
operations]{.underline}, AMISOM [professionals produce and manage
information about violence, engaging in what Talal Asad (2007) refers to
as "the etiquette of death dealing]{.underline}." A recent job
advertisement offers insights into death dealing as an informational
practice. Posted by an organization called Civilians in Conflict, the
terms of reference outline the responsibilities for a "Civilian Casualty
Tracking, Analysis, and Response Cell" (CCTARC) senior advisor, to be
posted with AMISOM in Mogadishu.11 The incumbent's primary duty would be
to establish a Civilian Casualty Tracking, Analysis, and Response Cell.
For this position, building relationships with "relevant stakeholders"
is key: included in this category are the Somali government, bilateral
and multilateral aid institutions, NGOs, and the UN. The incumbent would
draft "legally compliant" civilian casualty standard operating
procedures; he or she would utilize web-based and traditional media "to
ensure that AMISOM can publicize its response to civilian harm and
counter misinformation or deliberate propaganda." The candidate is
expected to possess expertise "in all aspects of civilian casualty
issues; including investigation and/or response," and to have experience
"with or in a military organization."12 At least four things are
striking about this job description, each of which highlights the
convergence between transnational governance and the making of security
states. First, the prospective employee learns at the outset who he or
she is accountable to ("relevant stakeholders" rather than the Somali
people) and, relatedly, that legitimate political actors operate only in
the realm of bureaucratic institutions, in what Arendt terms
"respectable society" (Arendt 2006).13 Second is the stated preference
for someone with experience in or with a military entity, suggesting
that AMISOM seeks someone capable of prioritizing institutional
directives over political or ethical considerations.14 Third is the
reference to misinformation and "deliberate propaganda," pointing to a
mode of governing in which knowledge is rendered suspect and in which
petty sovereigns are tasked with regulating its consumption (Masco
2010). Finally, the employee will be enmeshed in the disciplinary realm
of biopolitics, tasked with managing understandings of life/death and
civilian/terrorist. While there appear to be no existing procedures for
"handling" the loss of life, the employee will be tasked with producing
them. The broad objective, reflective of AMISOM's overall mission, is
the management of violence not its elimination. In this vein, for
transnational governing organs like AMISOM and the institutions it
cultivates, violence is not an exception but a key organizing principle
of governance. This is evident in a November 2013 UN Security Council
Resolution (2124) requesting that AMISOM establish standard operating
procedures for the handover of detainees who come into its custody
during military operations. [Aware of the use of secret prisons and
black sites by some of its most powerful member states,15 the UN and its
partners are compelled to bureaucratize the use of force through the
production of rules, laws, and procedures, and where necessary, to
replace legal procedures with administrative ones]{.underline} (Agamben
1998, Hussain 2003; Johns 2005; Butler 2006; Goede 2012; Khalili 2012).
[Petty sovereigns are thus tasked with glossing over the uneven power
relationships and political wrangling that animate the crafting and
implementing of policies]{.underline}16 (Clarke 2009; Li 2007;
Subramanian 2009), catering to the desires of AMISOM's state and
intergovernmental backers who expect scrupulous financial reports and
esthetically pleasing images of grateful Somalis. [The information they
produce]{.underline}---and the very process of producing it--- [works to
simplify complexity and to cultivate particular
dispositions]{.underline} (Clarke 2009; Feldman 2012) [that
simultaneously dull the senses to violence while creating the
technological and administrative architectures for its replication
elsewhere]{.underline} (Benjamin 2009 (1936), Arendt 1969; Masco 2006).
To produce a more complex narrative is to risk one's job or, more
likely, to invite more work. As Feldman illustrates in his ethnography
of the European Union's migration apparatus, the mundane rituals of
report, speech, and guideline writing become an "agreed upon set of
lenses" (Feldman 2012) designed to "make everything palatable," (Arendt
2006) in much the same way Adolf Eichmann characterized his profession
in WWII Germany. CONCLUSION While the machinations of transnational
governance work to legitimate the movement of bureaucrats, troops and
arms into Somalia in the name of security and the rule of law, competing
interests and actors make for a messy reality. According to the UN
Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea, some of the private security
contractors tasked with training the Somali security forces are not
registered as legal businesses in Somalia and regularly flaunt UN
requests for cargo manifests. Others, like the Dubai-based Australian
private security company Tacforce International, offer their protection
to UN, AU, and Somali officials while violating the terms of the arms
embargo.17 Among troop-contributing states, the Kenyan Defense Forces
(KDF) have reportedly struck deals with local militias to circumvent the
UN banned lucrative export of charcoal from the port of Kismayo: "with
the changeover of power in Kismayo, the shareholding of the charcoal
trade at the port was divided into three between Al-Shabaab, Ras Kamboni
and Somali Kenyan businessmen cooperating with the KDF."18 Fellow troops
from Uganda have protested delayed payments of their salaries, in some
cases by selling their arms to militias and private buyers. Their
commanders, just slightly higher up the food chain, have exercised what
leverage they have to restrict the use of armored vehicles, knowing that
the less frequently they are driven, the more fuel is available to
siphon off and sell.19 In 2008, the UN Monitoring Group estimated that
as much as 80% of the arms, ammunition, and other material supplied to
support the TFG had been diverted for private purposes, to the Somali
arms market, or to opposition groups, including Al-Shabaab (Wezeman
2010). Human Rights Watch reports of indiscriminate mortar and rocket
attacks by AMISOM in civilian areas, leading not only to loss of life
but also repeated displacement.20 [If and when these cracks are exposed,
it is the job of petty sovereigns to frame them as evidence of the need
for more trainings, more arms, and more troops]{.underline}. [In sum,
their job is to ensure that violence, in the public imaginary, occupies
a realm distinct from that of politics]{.underline} (Asad 2007; Clarke
2009; Mamdani 2009; Mullin 2014). To understand the dynamics as they are
unfolding requires consideration of the political economy of state
building, the histories of intervention in Somalia, and the politics
generated by the influx of a range of external actors with competing
political and economic interests. Further still, it requires attention
to, and analysis of, the ways in which the troops negotiate the
uncertainties and vulnerabilities created by their location in this
particular market for violent labor. [The entanglement of state-building
projects in counterterrorism strategies across the continent ensures
that multilateral governing bodies like the UN and AMISOM assume a
prominent role not only in the temporary contracting of violence but
also in building the infrastructure of security states, all the while
reaffirming their right "to grant or deny formal sovereignty," and to
"expand the informal zone where their own sovereign powers can be
exercised"]{.underline} (Cubukc u 2013: 49). As the transnational elites
who manage these operations are more often the beneficiaries (Pingeot
2012) [rather than the targets of securitized spaces and policies, they
become invested in particular understandings of law, peace, and
security]{.underline}. Indeed, the rationalization of AMISOM's work
seems to serve not only the purpose of public legitimation but also a
kind of self-hypnosis though which transnationally mobile elites
persuade themselves of their high moral purpose (Scott 1992). In this
sense, [the contracting and management of violent labor is as much about
crafting the sensibilities of petty sovereigns as it is about the armed
occupation of a given territory.]{.underline} [While it is on the
streets of Kismayo that violence is made real, it is in the bureaucratic
offices of Mogadishu, Nairobi, and New York that it is imagined---as
necessary, as legal, as civilizing, and as peace keeping.]{.underline}

#### The colonial logics of sovereignty and racism are mimicked within anti-racist and independence struggles---forms of colonial mimicry merely reproduce the same violences through which order and being are currently hegemonically overwritten. The desire for recognition motivates mimicking the terms of power, which only extends colonial violence. 

**Agathangelou 15** (Maya, Fanon on Decolonization and Revolution:
Bodies and Dialectics. You already know who she is. //lilith)

[Even as African countries gained 'independence' or 'nominal
independence']{.underline} (Nkrumah, 1965; Ce´saire, 1956) 2 [and
secured greater access to resources and civil rights, they continued to
turn to Europe.]{.underline} In the Wretched of the Earth, Fanon
[challenges mimicry of the European model: European achievements,
European techniques, and the European style ought no longer to tempt us
.]{.underline}.. When I search for Man in the technique and the style of
Europe, I see only a succession of negations of man, and an avalanche of
murders[. The human condition plans for mankind, and collaboration
between men in those tasks, which increase the sum total of humanity,
are new problems, which demand true inventions]{.underline}. (1961, p.
12) For Fanon, [racism and colonialism, and imperialism and slavery, are
contemporary problems, demanding contemporary (non-European)
approaches]{.underline}. [Modern practice of politics and
theorizing,]{.underline} Fanon argues, [presupposes a reconfiguration of
African sites as anarchical and African bodies into black flesh, or the
slave's 'fungibility', before any political or economic contracts can
begin.]{.underline} Though a fiction, these dichotomies of flesh/body
and body/mind still play a role in the disorder of the world[. Slavery
is a 'condition that anyone can be subjected to, to a world which
reconfigures the African body into Black flesh as the African's access
to (or, more correctly banishment, from) ontology']{.underline}
(Wilderson, 2011, p. 18). While Fanon would be the first to admit that
the slave 'body' as sentient flesh is not the only locus of imagining
and materializing global politics, it seems that such an engagement
though is crucial for him for a politics otherwise. An analytical
reading exposes how the slave has accumulated as an 'unacknowledged
debt' in political theory's repertoire since the late fifteenth century
despite our claims to civilization and modernity. Africana and
postcolonial theorists have acknowledged that much 'advancing' the
debate. However, Fanon's problematization of the human from the locus of
the species allows us to go further analytically by providing us the
conceptual repertoire to engage the 'frictions' within the binaries
mind/body, the human and the non-human all the while problematizing the
co-production of history and sovereign law. For a 'fiction,' of more
importantly, that presumes the material life of (the African or the
'Negro') or a 'destiny' which 'is not itself historical' a story about a
site and a body that 'fall\[s\] outside of time' (Marriott, 2012, p. 51)
there seems to be no place. For Fanon, this 'history' and its
naturalization is the problem. It masks its social production as well as
the life that goes into making possible the 'body' and the 'order' anew
with the (white) subject and his/her social contract a reality. [Theft
and property accumulation turn into productive technologies of a
'global' through which social distribution and order are being imagined:
']{.underline}Below the corporeal schema I had sketched [a
historico-social schema]{.underline} \... \[it was\] [the other, the
white man, who had woven me out of a thousand details, anecdotes,
stories']{.underline} (Fanon, 1961, p. 111). Conventional [theories that
argue in support of structures and anti-human projects are]{.underline}
either [unwilling or unable to grasp disciplinary representation of the
origins and evolution of the international order as constituted and
constitutive of the darker side of modernity]{.underline} (Mignolo,
2000) [and imperial adventures past and present.]{.underline} Fanon
problematizes the explanatory power of dialectics and political
philosophy whose dominant understandings feature the possibility of a
transformative human nature, as bankrupt in the face of the black and
the colonized subject. Following Fanon, at [the 'crux of modernity's
crisis is the dilemma of 'how to represent the Negro as being
demonstrably human within the terms of the law']{.underline} and the
dilemma of how to articulate that body' (Agathangelou, 2012, p. 452;
Wilderson, 2011, p. 45) as bodies, selves, and structures mutually
constitute one another, albeit in a disjunctive manner. Fanon states:
'[If we want humanity to advance a step further, if we want to bring it
up to a different level than that which Europe has shown it, then we
must invent and we must make discoveries]{.underline}' (1961, p. 136).
In the Wretched of the Earth, [Fanon contrasts Europe and history to the
invention of nature and the creation anew of 'all corners of the
globe']{.underline} (Fanon, 1961, p. 311). In short, he moves away from
a geometric or mere empirical understanding of the world. [Instead of
merely presuming what this global world means and what kind of
institutional arrangements and practices it might refer to, he asks what
kind of world is constituted, and what kind of ideas, institutions,
practices, and relations are made possible]{.underline}. This is what I
do here as well. In asking what work is being done with dialectics, by
dialectics in the co-production of the international structures
(contingent civil society and secular state) and subjects
(species/body/mind), I highlight the ways Fanon calls attention to 'real
leaps' to invent the new 'man' itself a (socio-technical imaginary), and
the new earth by focusing on the black--white relation/Master--Slave
Dialectic. Engaging simultaneously two important thematics central to
any conversation of dialectics today on the black and white
relationship, Fanon pushes for [articulating invention as a conceptual
resource that can contribute to the rupture of history and
politics]{.underline} (Marriott, 2011). He argues that for invention to
generate a humanity that is not degraded 'either in the face of its
finitude or against the backdrop of the great outdoors' (Negarestani,
2014, p. 1), suffering and resistance are not enough. For him,
[invention that has as its premise a creative leap without
self-destruction is a rupture irreducible to capture or
valuation]{.underline} (Marriott, 2011). Fanon begins by engaging with
the structure of this commitment; specifically, practicing these
relations may entail a violence that cannot be removed by sublation,
thus, demanding that we read critical works and their notions with
attention to their effects on and production of bodies. In Black Skin
White Masks, he considers whether the relationship of violence between
blacks and whites can be reversed. In 'The Negro and Language,' he
writes: 'On the philosophical level---that is, the plane of the basic
needs of human reality---I am willing to work on the psychoanalytical
level---in other words, the level of the 'failures,' in the sense in
which one speaks of engine failures' (Fanon, 1967, p. 23). For him,
failures are a result of the privileging of ontogenetic and phylogenetic
analyses of the black experience, recentralizing the need for the black
person to look to white people for recognition (Fanon, 1967, p. 1).
While he acknowledges that not all blacks will 'find themselves in what
follows,' he also says: 'This book is a clinical study. Those who
recognize themselves in it, I think, will have made a step forward. I
seriously hope to persuade my brother, whether black or white, to tear
off with all of his strength the shameful livery put together by
centuries of incomprehension' (Fanon, 1967, p. 12). For Fanon, '[To
speak, means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the
morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a
culture, to support the weight of a civilization]{.underline}' (1967,
pp. 17--18). [Many black men are learning to speak the language of the
master to be recognized and to move up socio-economically and
politically]{.underline}: 'The black man is supposed to be a good
nigger' (1967, p. 35). Yet 'when a Negro talks of Marx, the first
reaction is always the same: "We have brought you up to our level and
now you turn against your benefactors. Ingrates!"' (1967, p. 35). For
Fanon, [learning the language of the master to sublate the negativity
that the black body is inscribed with in the black-white relationship,
this mediation is a fiction.]{.underline} Learning [the language of the
master presupposes and reasserts the hegemony of whiteness, whereby
white decision-makers are already legitimate and do not require
approval; doing so presupposes the humanity of whites and the
fundamental inferiority and even non-existence of blacks]{.underline}.
Fanon elaborates another aspect of the colonial relation, the erotic,
foregrounding that the black--white relationship is also about sexual
power. The alternatives supplied under the rubric of freedom re-orient
one to believe love as a form of recognition able to sublate the
master/black violence. Yet, those blacks attempting to gain white
recognition by pursuing erotic love are participating in a neurotic
phenomenon. Fanon writes, describing Capecia: Mayotte loves a white man
to whom she submits in everything. He is her lord. All I know is that he
had blue eyes, blond hair, and a light skin, and that I loved him. It is
not difficult to see that a rearrangement of these elements in their
proper hierarchy would produce something of this order: 'I loved him
because he had blue eyes, blond hair, and a light skin'. (1967, pp.
42--43) 'What Mayotte wants,' he explains later, 'is a kind of
lactification. For, in a word, the race must be whitened' (1967, p. 47).
For Fanon, pursuing erotic love as a form of recognition is bound to
fail. Through an analysis of Mennoni's work on Caliban and Prospero, he
argues that [the psychology of colonization is equally problematic in
the ways it explains the 'dependency complex' and is not going to
transform and change the relation even if it is sexual and
intimate.]{.underline} He cites Mennoni as saying 'Not all peoples can
be colonized; only those who experience this need' (1967, pp. 88--89).
Fanon rejects this and asks: Why \... does he try to make the
inferiority complex something that antedates colonization? \... The
appearance of varicose veins in a patient does not arise out of him
being compelled to spend ten hours a day on his feet, but rather out of
the constitutional weakness of his vein walls; his working conditions
are only a complicating factor. And the insurance compensation expert to
whom the case is submitted. (1967, p. 393) If the architecture of the
body politic is unstable, with a weak somatic constitution, Fanon
argues, institutions, authority, and legitimacy are already weakened,
questioning whether intimacy and universality can be thought within
these historically given frames, let alone attained. In the final
chapter of Black Skin White Masks where he engages psychoanalysis as an
approach to disalienation, dehumanization, and repression and as an
effort to develop an understanding of the black--white relationship as
one of disorder, Fanon says, 'In response to the requirements of
dialectic one should investigate the extent to which the conclusions of
Freud or of Adler can be applied to the effort to understand the man of
color's view of the world' (1967, p. 141). These tools are not useful to
explain the experience of black people, many of whom become neurotic,
not because of 'certain infantile elements' (1967, p. 141) but because
of anti-black racism, white supremacy, sadistic and fascistic
institutions, all of which are the everyday of the modern world disorder
(1967, p. 149). Many psychological phenomena, according to Fanon, can be
traced to anti-black racism, white supremacy, and the profound fictions
that characterize them, but not in the abstract. This is true for black
people, whose existence and humanity are produced as structurally
impossible (Agathangelou, 2010, 2011; Wilderson, 2011) and it is true
for white people, many of whom suffer from negrophobia and
negrophilia---an ironic psychosexual phenomenon that cannot, Fanon
argues, be understood without appealing to sociogenesis: 'For the
majority of white men \... .the Negro represents the sexual instinct (in
its raw state). The Negro is the incarnation of a genital potency beyond
all moralities and prohibitions \... We have shown that reality destroys
all these beliefs' (Fanon, 1967, p. 177). In this final chapter, Fanon
argues that [the psychoanalytic approach does not 'dialectically' lead
to the disalienation and humanization of the human in
general]{.underline}. He [exposes the limits of classical
psychoanalysis; its ontogenetic and phylogenetic tools are
constitutionally incapable of understanding the effects of
socio-political structures on the individual psyche, especially the
psyche of a subject not constituted as human but as mere
flesh]{.underline}: 'The Negro problem \... does not resolve itself into
the problem of Negroes living among white men but rather of Negroes
being exploited, enslaved, \[and\] despised by a colonialist, capitalist
society that is only accidentally white' (1967, p. 202). [The Negro
'problem' cannot be resolved by having Negroes live with white men. It
is a question of recognizing, first, the problem]{.underline}. The
Negroes are 'exploited, enslaved and despised by a colonialist and
capitalist society that is accidentally white' (1967, p. 202). If this
is the Negro 'problem,' [it suggests the soma (body politic) itself is
in question; in other words, how do society and subjects come to
co-imagine themselves as 'white', propertied, and 'global' and with what
implications on the production of bodies?]{.underline}

## 2AC -- NATION STATE SUX

#### Nations are constructed through our affective investment into the logic of the strange and familial. Through the creation of "strangers" domestically the nation is able to mark others as "strangers" globally in order to preserve its coherence

**Ahmed 2k** (Sara, "Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in
Post-coloniality" pages 97-102. Former Professor of Race and Culural
Studies at Lancaster University and quit to protest. We stan. //lilith)

[How are nations invented and imagined]{.underline}? The work of
Benedict Anderson is crucial for an understanding of how 'the nation' is
imaginary or fantastic. According to Anderson, [both nationalism and
nationhood are 'cultural artefacts' (1983: 13), with their own
particular 'style in which they are imagined']{.underline} (1983: 15).
Such an approach allows us to recognise that [the boundaries of nations
are not simply geographical or geopolitical]{.underline} (though they
take both these forms), [but also discursive. The nation does not refer
to something that simply exists: nations are produced and constructed as
places and communities in which 'a people' might belong]{.underline}. Of
course, to say that nations are imagined is not to say that they are not
real. The question of nationhood cannot be properly addressed without a
recognition of the political economy of modern nation-states. An entity
can be imagined and real at the same time: in some sense, the opposition
between imaginary and real must be suspended if we are to understand how
the nation comes to be lived as an 'organic community'[. The imagining
of the nation as a space in which 'we' belong is not independent of the
material deployment of force, and the forms of governmentality which
control, not only the boundaries between nation states, and the
movements of citizens and aliens within the state, but also the
repertoire of images which allows the concept of the nation to come into
being in the first place.]{.underline} To think of the nation as
simultaneously imaginary and real (the nation as both fantasy and
material effect) is [also to think of the processes of identification
which allow the nation to be secured as one of the organising
assumptions of 'public life']{.underline} (Goffman 1972: ix). [What
forms of identification are produced with the nation? How does 'the
nation' come to be produced as a form of identification?]{.underline} In
other words, we need to examine how the invention of the nation as a
bounded space requires the production of a national identity which can
be claimed by the individual ('I am ... ') through reference to the
apparent transparency and coherence of the nation itself. [The
investment of the individual in being or having a nation suggests that
the discourse of nationhood operates at both a psychic and social level.
The individual]{.underline}, who encounters others in daily life, [comes
to identify as not only having but being a nationality,]{.underline}
through referring to public symbols and expressions which themselves
tell stories of what it means to be that nationality (the fleshing out
of the 'national character'), [and also through identifying with other
individuals with whom such stories can be shared]{.underline}. The
production of the nation involves not only image and myth-making -- the
telling of 'official' stories of origin -- but also the everyday
negotiations of what it means 'to be' that nation(ality). [The
production of the nation involves processes of self-identification in
which the nation comes to be realised as belonging to the
individual]{.underline} (the construction of the 'we' as utterable by
the individual). Crucially, then, [the production of nations constitutes
individuals as belonging to the nation: the work of 'the nation' is done
as much through the everyday encounters in public life, as it is done
through the political machinery of the nation-state]{.underline}. But
the production of the nation also involves imagining the nation space:
[it involves the projection of boundaries]{.underline} (nationhood as
cartography), [and the telling of stories about the authentic
landscape]{.underline} (for example, in travel writing and tourism), and
the production of interiority (imagining 'the heart of the nation').
[The construction of the nation space takes place alongside the
production of national character as instances in which 'the nation'
itself is fleshed out as place and person]{.underline}. The nation
becomes imagined as a body in which personhood and place are
precariously collapsed. [Through a metonymic elision, the individual can
claim to embody a nation, or the nation can take the shape of the body
of an individual ('bodyscape').]{.underline} But how do [the complex and
multiple sites of the production of nation- hood involve the reification
of the figure of the stranger]{.underline}? As I pointed out in my
introduction[, the formation of a dwelling or place of residence
involves a definition of who or what does not belong]{.underline}
(estrangement). At one level, such [distinctions between the familiar
and the strange take place in everyday encounters]{.underline}. [The
self-identification with the nation also involves the recognition of
others as belonging to the 'same' community]{.underline}. If we return
to my discussion of recognition in Chapter 1, we can consider how the
act of hailing or recognising some-body as a shared member of a
community serves to produce or flesh out that community through or
against the bodies of strangers. For example, [the recognition of
another as belonging to the same nation when travelling abroad relies on
techniques for reading and telling the difference between that which is
familiar and strange]{.underline}. The recognition of the other as from
a shared nation requires a rehearsal of a public discourse of nationhood
(shared memories of the nation space, the use of jokes, reference to
sporting events or national achievements). The recognition of others as
being from the same nation, or as sharing a nationality, hence involves
an everyday and much rehearsed distinction between who does and does not
belong within the nation space. [The production of the
nation]{.underline}, in such a model[, requires some-body or some-where
to not-be in order for it to be. This demarcation of spaces of belonging
through estrangement is central to Said's now classical theory of
Orientalism: the Occident comes into being as a material place through
the creation of an ontological distinction between it and the
Orient.]{.underline} [The Orient comes to embody that which the Occident
is not.]{.underline} That is, the Orient creates Europe (or the
Occident) as a bounded space in the very event of being positioned as
its Other. The fascination with the Orient within Western imperial
culture is a fascination which, in Said's terms, creates an idea of
Europe, 'a notion collectively identifying "us against the
non-Europeans" ' (1978: 7). [Orientalism creates an imaginary
geographical divide based on the binarism of
Occident/Orient]{.underline}. In this sense, [the creation of a space of
belonging]{.underline} (the 'we' that remains unspoken, or is spoken
only through the claiming of the right to speak) [requires that which is
strange in order to be. The nation is one such space of
belonging.]{.underline} Robin Cohen's reflection on the discourse of
nationhood emphasises how national identity is produced through the
differentiation between familiar and strange: 'a [complex national and
social identity is continuously constructed and reshaped in
its]{.underline} (often antipathetic) [interaction with outsiders,
strangers, foreigners and the "others]{.underline}". [You know who you
are, only by knowing who you are not]{.underline}' (1994: 1). In Cohen's
model, strangers are not external to the formation of national identity:
the nation requires strangers in order to exist. Despite this, the
formation of identity is defined in terms of frontiers: strangers are
the ones who are encountered at the border, and whose proximity
threatens the coherence of national identity. Féher and Heller's
consideration of nations poses an analogy between 'the nation' and the
'house': 'a country has a certain number of inhabitants who are supposed
to close the doors behind them, not to let in any casual stranger
without a preliminary agreement; however it can also open its doors'
(1994: 143). Here, the question of the stranger in the nation is a
question of opening or closing the doors: the stranger can either be let
in or kept out. What I want to suggest in contrast is that [the
definition of the nation as a space, body, or house requires the
proximity of 'strangers' within that space, whether or not that
proximity is deemed threatening]{.underline} (monoculturalism) [or is
welcomed]{.underline} (multiculturalism). A key problem in this
literature on nationhood is the use of the model of 'generalisable
other', in which national identity is simply defined through and against
an other, as such (Cohen 1994: 1). What is demanded is a much more
contextual and nuanced understanding of the role of differentiated
others in the demarcation of national identity. In Chapter 2, I examined
how bodily integrity is produced, not simply through or against a
generalisable other, but by differentiating between others, who have a
different function in establishing the permeability of bodily space.
[The very habits and gestures of marking out bodily space involve
differentiating 'others' into familiar]{.underline} (assimilable,
touchable) [and strange]{.underline} (unassimilable, untouchable). While
I would not want to imply that we can make a simple analogy between
bodies and nations, I think we can understand how [bodily and social
spaces leak into each other, or inhabit each other]{.underline} (see
also Chapter 4). The nation becomes imagined and embodied as a space,
not simply by being defined against other spaces, but by being defined
as close to some others (friends), and further away from other others
(strangers). In this sense, only some others are read as strangers
within the nation space. [The proximity of strangers within the nation
space]{.underline} -- that is, the proximity of that which cannot be
assimilated into a national body -- [is a mechanism for the demarcation
of the national body, a way of defining borders within it, rather than
just between it and an imagined and exterior other]{.underline}. As
Christine Inglis demonstrates, [the encountering of cultural difference
within the fantastic nation space allows the work of nation formation to
be sustained: strangers, those who are not recognised as 'typical' of a
nation, might allow the question of what it means to be a nation to be
posed (again and again).]{.underline} Inglis argues that, 'Many nations
are having to confront the issue of how they respond to these
"strangers" in their midst and how they incorporate them within their
existing society and institutions. In so doing, the issue of national
identity as a symbolic and legal issue inevitably comes to the fore'
(1997: 204). The proximity of strangers requires the nation to respond:
there is a constant process of adjustment and transformation. The nation
is not secured in the process of keeping strangers out: the stranger's
proximity is required if the stranger is to be known as the limit of
'the nation'. National identity emerges as a site of social conflict:
there is a constant redefinition of who 'we' are through the very
necessity of encoun- tering strangers within the nation space. As
Zygmunt Bauman puts it, the question is not, 'how to get rid of
strangers and the strange, but how to live with them -- daily and
permanently' (1997: 55). [National identity is unstable, and emerges
through multiple encounters between those who assume themselves to be
natives and those recognised as strangers, as out of place, in
this]{.underline} place. The response to strangerness in the discourse
of nationhood is hence built around the question of what it means to be
'in place'. The assumption that strangers only populate the borders of
the nation is in danger of reifying those borders: rather we need to
understand the process of negotiation between identity and strangerness
as ongoing, and as moving across different spatial formations (the body,
home, the neighbourhood, the city, the country, the region, the nation,
the globe). Immigration policy and border controls are not the only
places in which the question of 'the stranger' is posed for and by the
nation. National identity is metonymically related to other sites of
identity formation: [through marking out spaces of dwelling, spaces
which are familiar and inhabitable, subjects are interpellated into
multiple regimes. Like other forms of identity, nationhood is constantly
renegotiated, and that negotiation is crucially dependent on
encountering those who are recognisable as strangers, and who demand a
response from the citizen:]{.underline} who are they? do they belong
here? who am I? who are we? The distinction between native and stranger
within a nation is not simply enforced at the border: rather, that
distinction determines different ways in which subjects inhabit -- which
involves both dwelling and movement (see Chapter 1) -- the space of the
nation. [The figure of the stranger is also constructed at the level of
governmentality as the 'origin' of the very question of national
identity:]{.underline} how do we live together, as one or many (= the
strategic question of monocultural or multicultural government policy)?
Or even, who is the 'we' of the nation if 'they' are here to stay?
[Thinking about multiculturalism must begin, therefore, with an under-
standing that the coherence of the 'we' of the nation is always
imaginary and that, given this, such a 'we' does not abolish cultural
difference, but emerges through it]{.underline}. Multiculturalism is
always contested, whether at the level of government policy, or whether
in critical scholarship and resistant political activity.
Multiculturalism is one of many historically specific negotiations of
'the nation'. There are key national and regional differences in how a
discourse of multiculturalism emerges and is contested (see Rystad
1997). As Theo Goldberg argues, 'Multiculturalism and commitments to
cultural diversity emerged out of the conflictual history of resistance,
accommodation, integration and transformation' (1994: 7).
Multiculturalism can name a range of activities in education, as well as
in grass roots political campaigns, which are based on the revaluing of
minority cultures, and hence on the promotion of differences that are
not accommodated within the official discourses of nationhood (Gunew
1994: 5). But, in other instances, [multiculturalism works as an
'official' discourse: that is, it involves the setting of governmental
agendas on what it should mean to be 'a nation]{.underline}'.

#### The nation is made into a place where 'a people' and 'a family' may belong. This process intertwines our affective investment into the nation state -- therefore the nation-state is not an inherent fact of belonging but is reproduced on a social level.

[How are nations invented and imagined]{.underline}? The work of
Benedict Anderson is crucial for an understanding of how 'the nation' is
imaginary or fantastic. According to Anderson, [both nationalism and
nationhood are 'cultural artefacts' (1983: 13), with their own
particular 'style in which they are imagined']{.underline} (1983: 15).
Such an approach allows us to recognise that [the boundaries of nations
are not simply geographical or geopolitical]{.underline} (though they
take both these forms), [but also discursive. The nation does not refer
to something that simply exists: nations are produced and constructed as
places and communities in which 'a people' might belong]{.underline}. Of
course, to say that nations are imagined is not to say that they are not
real. The question of nationhood cannot be properly addressed without a
recognition of the political economy of modern nation-states. An entity
can be imagined and real at the same time: in some sense, the opposition
between imaginary and real must be suspended if we are to understand how
the nation comes to be lived as an 'organic community'[. The imagining
of the nation as a space in which 'we' belong is not independent of the
material deployment of force, and the forms of governmentality which
control, not only the boundaries between nation states, and the
movements of citizens and aliens within the state, but also the
repertoire of images which allows the concept of the nation to come into
being in the first place.]{.underline} To think of the nation as
simultaneously imaginary and real (the nation as both fantasy and
material effect) is [also to think of the processes of identification
which allow the nation to be secured as one of the organising
assumptions of 'public life']{.underline} (Goffman 1972: ix). [What
forms of identification are produced with the nation? How does 'the
nation' come to be produced as a form of identification?]{.underline} In
other words, we need to examine how the invention of the nation as a
bounded space requires the production of a national identity which can
be claimed by the individual ('I am ... ') through reference to the
apparent transparency and coherence of the nation itself. [The
investment of the individual in being or having a nation suggests that
the discourse of nationhood operates at both a psychic and social level.
The individual]{.underline}, who encounters others in daily life, [comes
to identify as not only having but being a nationality,]{.underline}
through referring to public symbols and expressions which themselves
tell stories of what it means to be that nationality (the fleshing out
of the 'national character'), [and also through identifying with other
individuals with whom such stories can be shared]{.underline}. The
production of the nation involves not only image and myth-making -- the
telling of 'official' stories of origin -- but also the everyday
negotiations of what it means 'to be' that nation(ality). [The
production of the nation involves processes of self-identification in
which the nation comes to be realised as belonging to the
individual]{.underline} (the construction of the 'we' as utterable by
the individual). Crucially, then, [the production of nations constitutes
individuals as belonging to the nation: the work of 'the nation' is done
as much through the everyday encounters in public life, as it is done
through the political machinery of the nation-state]{.underline}. But
the production of the nation also involves imagining the nation space:
[it involves the projection of boundaries]{.underline} (nationhood as
cartography), [and the telling of stories about the authentic
landscape]{.underline} (for example, in travel writing and tourism), and
the production of interiority (imagining 'the heart of the nation').
[The construction of the nation space takes place alongside the
production of national character as instances in which 'the nation'
itself is fleshed out as place and person]{.underline}. The nation
becomes imagined as a body in which personhood and place are
precariously collapsed. [Through a metonymic elision, the individual can
claim to embody a nation, or the nation can take the shape of the body

#### State theory formulates infrastructures of tolerance that suggest that there must be an original understanding of the other while forefronting the ideology that inclusion is both necessary and possible by prescribing a belief of what progress appears.

grounds of [Mankind's global integrity as such---[becomes the subject of
a creative disintegration (some will call this terrorism, others call it

dominance from a changing circuit of abstraction and embodiment: [[there
is a template for humanity's progress]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are
terms (scientific, Biblical, politico-economic, or otherwise) through
which the most evolved, blessed, modern, and autonomous of [[the human

tied to notions of manifest personhood]{.underline}]{.mark}, including
but not limited to genes, spirit, blood, epidermis, and cranial capacity
(such is the rough description of humanity's speciation---a narrative of
differentiation within the category of human being that militarizes the
terms of the ascendant species-group[[).]{.mark} **These are the
premises of White Being[. Apprehend the United States, in]{.mark} the

is [[the position that offers humanitarian favors against the wish and
urge to violently decline them.]{.underline}]{.mark} There is a claim
that persists beneath the din of civil accommodations, that changes in
tenor but not in premise. Accusations of [[backwardness, savagery,
tribalism, and even fundamentalism become self-replicating when such
humanitarianism is rejected by the ungrateful, suspicious antagonists of
white humanity's creeping universals. The language of urban-to-rural
insurrection]{.underline}]{.mark}---when the people "riot," "loot,"
burn, and destroy---moves from a vocabulary of anti-humanitarianism
(which, in this sense, is also a recalibration of the world to mirror
the evil) to insist that it is [[in the moment when the representatives
of white humanity extend the helping hand that there must be a state of
militant opposition;]{.underline}]{.mark} a tensing against the insult.
It is in times like this that the white human creates the groundwork of
its forcible universality. This is the other side of the aforementioned
redemption: a rejection of the invitation to thrill in the absolute
violence of a charity. There are different versions of the
gesture---modernization, independence, full citizenship, franchise,
rights. [[Appendages of another body, an alien body. Rejection
comes]{.mark} later[, when the charity is experienced as redemption in

condescension in the first place]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is part of the
generalized fact that the white human condition---the condition of
Mankind's restoration, remaking, and periodic reconstruction---is
already steeped in an edifice of accessibility (the common sense of
humanism rests on the myth of access[[). This human]{.mark} in the seat
of humanism [calls on other species to feed, to shit, to vote, to work,

#### In order to disengage with violent relations of power we must refuse the call to be included within the universal of the state. Only then can we find new ways to relate and be in the world.

The concept of the universal is one borne out of inherently limited
access---of those who are considered civil within a system that
predetermines which bodies will have an easier time accessing the
protections, privileges, and benefits of the state. I have argued that
**[the concept of inclusion into the universal is always already limited
by its colonial construction---its framework is conditioned by white
supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and capitalism]{.underline}**. This affects
all people, but queer and trans people of color occupy a pronounced
positionality within the intersectional spaces between these three
systems of power. [If the goal of resistance work is to abolish systems
of power, and in turn to abolish colonialism, then as long as
colonialism and its ongoing instantiations of settler colonialism and
neocolonialism continue]{.underline}, [rights will never bring about the
change queer and trans people are seeking]{.underline}. So we must ask
ourselves, when we seek justice, is it rights that we seek? Or is it the
"something more" we have always already inhabited? Mainstream [LGBT
people, white people, and **people** with]{.underline} access to [wealth
**must all disengage from the benefits of these systemic power relations
to consider something different**]{.underline}**,** something that will
not bring more people further up in the hierarchy so that the structure
grows, but rather **[something that will seek to dismantle it
altogether]{.underline}**. For, in the words of Audre Lorde, **[the
master's tools will never dismantle the master's
house.\[]{.underline}**68\] [We already practice this critical work
within our everyday lives]{.underline}. **[Our communities are invested
in practices of care;]{.underline}** **[in resisting the confines of
"expected" behavior; questioning]{.underline}** [logics of
heteropatriarchy in our lives; working through our own understandings of
gender]{.underline} outside a strict gender binary; [offering support,
healing, and harm reduction practices outside what the state
condones;]{.underline} [working through]{.underline} our own
constructions of [conflict resolution and community
accountability]{.underline}; creating chosen families, practicing
polyamorous relations, engaging in friendships that center love, and
working beyond heteronormative constructions of jealousy and
property-based relations that found heteronormative dyadic expectations.
[From the moment colonialism extended its]{.underline} violent
[reaches]{.underline} [through]{.underline} projects of
[Western]{.underline} [imperial expansion]{.underline}, Indigenous
people and people living under colonialism worldwide have been resisting
colonial heteropatriarchy. W[e are engaging in everyday practices of
building and rebuilding, practicing, learning, and relearning how to
live and love in the face of these systems]{.underline}, resisting calls
for conscription into the interrelated and violent disciplinary projects
of heteropatriarchy, capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. This
work demonstrates that [**in these practices, we are already something
more than what we are told the universal space of inclusion will
offer.** Ongoing histories]{.underline} and practices of struggle and
resistance [have demonstrated what is at stake when our focus is solely
on inclusion into the universal]{.underline}. [Moving from a space that
questions universal inclusion while fighting for a redistribution of
resources through many tactics allows for a consideration of what
possibilities for relationality are foreclosed when engaging primarily
in rights-based redress,]{.underline} [as well as what other
possibilities exist for offering other ways of being in the
world]{.underline}. In order to fully account for the realm of the
universal, framing the development of universality as occurring within
the rise of colonial-modernity can expose the dynamic between rights and
the legitimations for colonialism as based on heteropatriarchy. [To see
these power relations not as separate, but in fact as constitutive of
the formation of the "universal" of modernity, exposes the limitations
of rights-based incorporation as a fundamental reaffirmation of
settler-colonial state power]{.underline} used to negotiate the freedom
and legitimacy for some as constantly conditioned on the unfreedom and
illegitimacy of others. As critical queer and trans movement work has
articulated, [resistance to these power relations is the work that
involves everyone]{.underline}, [which must comprise leaving behind our
investments in inclusion]{.underline} under the façade of universal
equality [and open our eyes to the ongoing work that is already
happening]{.underline} through engaging with communities in resistance.
[The lives we live are complicated lives]{.underline}, with complex and
intertwined relationships to colonial heteropatriarchal logics. Our
histories are multifaceted, and live through us in our ongoing
struggles. Let us remember to tell these histories as they are---in
their complications, in their difficulties, and in the hope of what it
means when we work through and against them in building together. And in
holding this, [we must also hold the awareness that the institutions and
projects of the universal]{.underline} [will always seek to co-opt
us]{.underline}, to bring us in so that we may have the privileges [to
fight their wars and marry in their churches and extract their profits
and expand their diversity;]{.underline} [so that we might
have]{.underline} a coveted set of rights promised to all deserving
citizenry, [the right to carry on the neocolonial and imperial violence
that is the project of the United States]{.underline}, [the right to
settle and perpetuate investment in this stolen land, the right to the
pursuit of multicultural white supremacist happiness.]{.underline} And
so **[we must]{.underline} also [carry]{.underline} with us [the
knowledge that their prisons will never make us safer]{.underline},
[that their laws will never fully include all of us, and that the
ability for only some to climb over that wall and blend into
cookie-cutter streets at the expense of those continually pushed out,
murdered, and ignored will never be enough.]{.underline}** Part of
[**this ongoing work**, built]{.underline} through the resistance and
struggle [over the past five hundred years as methodologies of
abolitionism]{.underline}, **[is to look]{.underline}** for those
convergences, to seek the layers upon layers of consolidation, the
concentric genealogies, not necessarily as purely linear or
chronological but **[through a framework that can support the move to
resist inclusion into a universal that has always maintained a limited
access into its exclusive realm]{.underline}**. We may hold within us
the understanding that these logics run deep, but so too, do we. [In
this we work, learn, love and fight toward something more]{.underline}.
We move toward a sense, deep and across many realms, that there is
always something more, and in our resistance, in our survival, and in
our remembered names, [we are already something more.]{.underline}

#### Gender is not a product of production, but is production. The organization of kinship sets the stage for capitalist and desire production -- the aff link turns the criticism.

**baedan 14** (a queer journal of heresy, "Against the Gendered
Nightmare". capital letters are so passé. //lilith)

This limit---[[the conflation of the exploitation]{.mark} of subjects
[by capitalism with evidence that capitalism is the origin]{.mark} of
those subjects---[is a flaw of all]{.mark} self-proclaimed ['scientific'
disciplines which]{.mark} aim to [generalize one story into a
materialist theory that locates economics as the cause of all
woes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Following from this, she identifies a wide
range of non-capitalist cultures which are vehemently patriarchal,
including pre-capitalist feudal Europe. She then details several
practices of gender domination (foot binding, chastity belts, and other
fetishized indignities) which cannot be accounted for by a Marxist
analysis of the reproduction of labor power. She argues that at most,
Marxist Feminism can explain the way capitalism seized upon and tinkered
with already existing forces of social control. '[The analysis of the
reproduction of labor power does not even explain why it is usually
women rather than men who do domestic work in the home]{.underline}.'
She argues that [[economics cannot account for the moral element which
determines that a wife is among the commodities needed by a man]{.mark},
that only men can talk to God, and that women are the ones who perform
domestic labor]{.underline}. To her, [[this]{.mark} moral element [is
the]{.mark} massive and [unexplored terrain from which gendered violence
emerges]{.mark} and [that it is the basis of the femininity]{.mark} and
masculinity [that capitalism]{.mark} later
[inherited]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is into this element that she'll
direct the rest of her study. She concludes her critique of [Marxist
feminism by illustrating the silliness of reducing the vastness of the
sex/gender system to being simply 'the reproductive' sphere. For her,
[there is]{.mark} far [too much excess]{.mark} in that system [to be
solely the reproductive aspect of industrial production]{.mark}. Not to
mention that it is also productive in its own way: producing gendered
subjects, for example. [The origins of gender domination]{.mark}, she
claims, [must be located outside the 'mode of
production]{.mark}.']{.underline} Her attempt to find this outside is to
first look at the writings of Levi-Strauss in his explorations of early
kinship structures. His writing places gender and sexuality at the
center of these structures; he develops a theory that links their
essence to the exchange of women between men of various social groups.
In doing so, Rubin believes he has sketched an implicit theory of
gendered oppression. He primarily comes to this conclusion after
studying the role of gift exchange in pre-state arrangements. He finds
that the exchange of gifts was the first measure taken in the long road
toward the development of 'civil society' and the state. For him,
marriage is one of the most significant forms of gift exchange, with
women themselves being the gifts given from one man to another. From
here, he analyzes the incest taboo as a means of policing and enforcing
this exchange of women as gifts. The taboo is less about preventing
endogamous sexual relations, and much more about obliging the exchange
of sisters and daughters into exogamous relations; it is an early
expression of commodity society. [The exchange of human beings is more
powerful than other gifts because it is not simply an arrangement of
reciprocity, but one of kinship. This results in a more long-lasting and
expansive relationship which orders all other types of exchange through
the established kinship network.]{.underline} The marriage ceremonies
recorded in the ethnographic literature are moments in a ceaseless and
ordered procession in which women, children, shells, words, cattle,
names, fish, ancestors, whale's teeth, pigs, yams, spells, dances, mats
and so on, pass from hand to hand, leaving as their tracks the ties that
bind[. [Kinship is organization]{.mark}, and organization gives power.
Organization, then, is [an original structure of power between those who
exchange others]{.mark}. This difference between the exchanged and the
exchangers is a primary split in the system we'll call
gender.]{.underline} For Rubin, the split is between men as organizers,
and women as conduits to organization; men as exchange partners and
women as gifts. The circulation of women provides the mystical powers of
kinship to the men who exchange them; the men benefit from the
subsequent social organization. [The vast permutations of gendered
organization today will not deviate from this unending exchange of
bodies.]{.underline} Women are given in marriage, taken in battle,
exchanged for favors, sent as tribute, traded, bought, and sold. Far
from being confined to the "primitive world," these practices seem only
to become more pronounced and commercialized in more "civilized"
societies. Rubin finds [this concept useful because it locates gender's
emergence in social structures, rather than in biology. Further, it
understands [gender domination to be more rooted in the exchange of
bodies than in the exchange of merchandise.]{.mark} Here, [gender is
not]{.mark} explained away as [a function of reproduction, but is
production itself.]{.mark}]{.underline} [It is an entire system where
individual bodies are produced as gendered subjects and exchanged in the
production of kinship structures]{.underline}. [This system does not
just exchange women, but ancestry, lineage names, social power,
children. [The inauguration of gender violence emerges from this system
within which]{.mark} sex and [gender are organized; the economic
exploitation]{.mark} of this or that gender [is secondary]{.mark} to
this.]{.underline} This story is relevant to the larger one we're trying
to weave because it features gender as inextricably bound to a monster
which is Rubin euphemistically calls social organization. We would call
the monster [domestication, and from this story we can determine a lot
about its character and tendencies]{.underline}. Rubin of course, in
typical academic fashion, shies away from the totality of these
conclusions. She says that, since Levi-Strauss located this exchange as
the beginning of the culture of civilization ("his analysis implies that
the world-historical defeat of women occurred with the origin of
culture, and is a prerequisite of culture"), holding to a firm
interpretation of the theory would also imply that her "feminist task"
would require the destruction of that culture. This destruction remains
unthinkable in her system of thought. Again, we'll choose to go where
others will not. That an argument points to a necessary destruction of
everything is precisely why we'd follow it. The second story that Gayle
Rubin recites is one more common: psychoanalysis and its Oedipus
complex. [Rubin correctly berates psychoanalysis for its tendency to
become more than a theory of the mechanisms which reproduces gender and
sexuality; she argues it has largely become one of those
mechanisms]{.underline}. She follows that a revolt against the
mechanisms of gender must then also be a critique of psychoanalysis.
This critique isn't new for us; Hocquenghem's [queer refusal of
civilization is predicated on this very refusal of
psychoanalysis.]{.underline} Rubin looks at the same concepts as
Hocquenghem in an attempt to flesh out her theory of gender's emergence.
Primarily, she concerns herself with how [psychoanalysis can hint toward
the way children are forced into the categories of boys and
girls]{.underline}. Her exegesis of psychoanalysis mostly centers around
Lacan, who views his efforts as an attempt to identify the traces left
in the individual's psyche by their conscription into kinship
structures, as well as the transformation of their sexuality as they are
integrated into civilized culture. For Rubin this is a nice complement
to Levi-Strauss; whereas the she had already examined the exchange of
individuals within a gender system, she now turns to the interior
realities of those exchanged. She begins from Oedipus: Oedipal crisis
occurs when a child learns of the sexual rules embedded in the terms for
family and relatives. [The crisis begins when the child comprehends the
system and his or her place in it; Before the Oedipal phase, the
sexuality of the child is\... unstructured.]{.underline} Each child
contains all the sexual possibilities available to human expression. But
in any given society, [only some of these possibilities will be
expressed, while others will be constrained]{.underline}. Upon leaving
the Oedipal phase, the child's libido and [gender identity have been
organized in conformity with the rules of the culture which is
domesticating it]{.underline}\... Oedipal complex is an apparatus for
the production of sexual personality. Societies will inculcate in their
young the character traits appropriate to carry on the business of
society\... such as the transformation of the working class into good
industrial workers. [Just as the social forms of labor demand certain
kinds of personality, the social forms of sex and gender demand certain
kinds of people.]{.underline} In the most general terms, the Oedipal
complex is a machine which fashions the appropriate forms of sexual
individuals. Psychoanalysis largely concerns itself with how a child can
properly adapt to this machine. Rubin would say that the machine needs
to be changed. [We'll assert that the machine must be
destroyed.]{.underline} Rubin details how the machine functions along
with an equally familiar concept, the phallus. She emphasizes that
rather than being a biological object, the phallus is primarily a symbol
of belonging to a gendered social order. The father possesses it, and so
he can exchange it for a woman; if a boy behaves and is properly
domesticated, he can one day have the phallus too. The girl is denied
it, and thus has nothing with which to bargain for it. The phallus is
transmitted through particularly gendered bodies and rests upon others.
In the same way as the kinship system detailed by Levi-Strauss [gives
certain people the ability to exchange others as a commodity, the
phallus is the mystical dimension of belonging which is traded for these
bodies in turn.]{.underline} For Rubin, [these systems cohere into a
mutually reinforcing dynamic where women are dispossessed of their very
being, and are possessed and exchanged by men. The linkage of these men
through their exchange of the woman and phallus creates the social bonds
upon which organized civilization is based]{.underline}.

HAPTICALITY, OR LOVE

**[Never being on the right side]{.underline}** of the Atlantic **[is an
unsettled feeling]{.underline}**, **[the feeling of a thing that
unsettles with others]{.underline}**. It's a feeling, if you ride with
it, **[that produces a certain distance from the settled]{.underline}**,
from those who determine themselves in space and time, who locate
themselves in a determined history. To have been shipped is to have been
moved by others, with others. It is to feel at home with the homeless,
at ease with the fugitive, at peace with the pursued, at rest with the
ones who consent not to be one. Outlawed, interdicted, intimate things
of the hold, containerized contagion, logistics externalises logic
itself to reach you, **[but this is not enough to get at the social
logics]{.underline}**, **[the social poesis]{.underline}**, **[running
through logisticality]{.underline}**. Because while certain abilities --
to connect, to translate, to adapt, to travel -- were forged in the
experiment of hold, they were not the point. As David Rudder sings,
"**[how we vote is not how we party]{.underline}**." Te hold's
**[terrible gift was to gather dispossessed feelings in
common]{.underline}**, **[to create a new feel in the
undercommons]{.underline}**. Previously, this kind of feel was only an
exception, an aberration, a shaman, a witch, a seer, a poet amongst
others, who felt through others, through other things. Previously,
except in these instances, feeling was mine or it was ours. But in the
hold, in the undercommons of a new feel, another kind of feeling became
common. **[This form of feeling was not collective]{.underline}**,
**[not given to decision]{.underline}**, **[not adhering or reattaching
to settlement]{.underline}**, **[nation]{.underline}**,
**[state]{.underline}**, **[territory or historical]{.underline}**
**[story]{.underline}**; **[nor was it repossessed by the
group,]{.underline}** which could not now feel as one, **[reunifed in
time and space]{.underline}**. No, **[when Black Shadow sings "are you
feelin' the feelin?'' he is asking about something else]{.underline}**.
**[He is asking about a way of feeling through others]{.underline}**,
**[a feel for feeling others feeling you]{.underline}**. **[This is
modernity's insurgent feel]{.underline}**, its inherited caress, its
skin talk, tongue touch, breath speech, hand laugh. Tis is the feel that
no individual can stand, and no state abide. **[This is the feel we
might call hapticality]{.underline}**. **[Hapticality]{.underline}**,
the touch of the undercommons, **[the interiority of
sentiment]{.underline}**, the feel that what is to come is here.
Hapticality, **[the capacity to feel though others]{.underline}**,
**[for others to feel through you]{.underline}**, for you to feel them
feeling you, this feel of the shipped is not regulated, at least not
successfully, by a state, a religion, a people, an empire, a piece of
land, a totem. Or perhaps we could say these are now recomposed in the
wake of the shipped. To feel others is unmediated, immediately social,
amongst us, our thing, and even when we recompose religion, it comes
from us, and even when we recompose race, we do it as race women and
men. **[Refused these things,]{.underline}** **[we first refuse
them]{.underline}**, **[in the contained]{.underline}**, **[amongst the
contained]{.underline}**, **[lying together in the ship]{.underline}**,
**[the boxcar]{.underline}**, **[the prison]{.underline}**, **[the
hostel]{.underline}**. **[Skin]{.underline}**, against epidermalisation,
**[senses touching]{.underline}**. Trown together touching each other we
were denied all sentiment, denied all the things that were supposed to
produce sentiment, family, nation, language, religion, place, home.
Tough forced to touch and be touched, to sense and be sensed in that
space of no space, though refused sentiment, history and home, we feel
(for) each other. A feel, a sentiment with its own interiority, there on
skin, soul no longer inside but there for all to hear, for all to move.
Soul music is a medium of this interiority on the skin, its regret the
lament for broken hapticality, its self-regulatory powers the invitation
to build sentimentality together again, feeling each other again, how we
party. Tis is our hapticality, our love. Tis is love for the shipped,
love as the shipped. Tere's a touch, a feel you want more of, which
releases you. **[The closest Marx ever got to the general antagonism was
when he said "from each according to his ability, to each according to
his need" but we have read this as the possession of ability and the
possession of need]{.underline}**. **[What if we thought of the
experiment of the hold as the absolute fluidity]{.underline}**, **[the
informality]{.underline}**, **[of this condition of need and
ability?]{.underline}** **[What if ability and need were in constant
play and we found someone who dispossessed us so that this movement was
our inheritance]{.underline}**. **[Your love makes me strong, your love
makes me weak]{.underline}**. What if "the between the two," the lost
desire, the articulation, was this rhythm, this inherited experiment of
the shipped in the churning waters of fesh and expression that could
grasp by letting go ability and need in constant recombination. If he
moves me, sends me, sets me adrift in this way, amongst us in the
undercommons. So long as she does this, she does not have to be. **[Who
knows where Marx got this inheritance of the hold]{.underline}**,
**[from Aristotle denying his slave world or Kant talking to sailors or
Hegel's weird auto-eroticism or just being ugly and dark and
fugitive.]{.underline}** Like Zimmy says, precious angel, **[you know
both our forefathers were slaves]{.underline}**, which is not something
to be ironic about. This feel is the hold that lets go (let's go) again
and again to dispossess us of ability, fll us with need, give us ability
to fll need, this feel. We hear the godfather and the old mole calling
us to become, in whatever years we have, philosophers of the feel.

#### Permutation do both -- refuse the alternative's attempt to disrupt the multitudinous potential of our politics -- "to know the end is to think one knows the totality of the landscape"

\| CRITICAL PRAXIS TOWARD NO "END," Febuary 2019, *Critique and Praxis
13/13*\]//vikas

**[Fundamental here is both the critical and the praxis]{.underline}**.
If critical, which is to say an adjectival critique, **[is a ruthless
interrogation of the established and
institutionalized]{.underline}**---and this, of course, **[is in the
vein of Marx]{.underline}**'s 1843 letter to Arnold Ruge, **[in which he
urges the undertaking of]{.underline}** "die rücksichtlose Kritik alles
Bestehenden"---**[an interrogation of that which settles into a
normative hold circumscribing salvific excesses]{.underline}**; **[and
if praxis is a doing]{.underline}**, **[an agential enactment that bears
on sociality]{.underline}**, **[then a critical praxis marks an
interrogative social enactment]{.underline}**. What kind of politics
might this lead to? **[What kind of sociality might this
engender]{.underline}**, and who might show up to this coalitional
gathering? **[Those maroons, subversive intellectuals, fugitives,
queers, black feminists, and rebellious workers meet to conspire
together]{.underline}** in the undercommons: a non-place where everyone
is black, queer, insurgent, because **[one is changed by entrance into
the undercommons inasmuch as the undercommons is not a place you enter
but a groove that enters you]{.underline}**. Critical praxis becomes a
radical invitation to not only do but to be done by the undercommon
insurgency that places a demand. And such an interrogation must suspend
the presumption of the end goal. We know from Moten and Harney, and Jack
Halberstam, that what we think we want before the crucial point of
crisis that precipitates our insurgency will necessarily shift after
we've attained the limits of what our coalitional knowledge could
compile. **[It is not because we are insufficient]{.underline}**, **[as
if insufficiency is a deficiency rather than a willingness to risk
getting at the outer limits]{.underline}** of where we dared to think;
it is because we cannot, and must not, assume that the logics and
rubrics---radically altered as they may be---**[we have when moving
within the maelstrom of the hegemonic in order to exceed that maelstrom
can operate to our benefit]{.underline}** when we've breached the
hegemon. We will need new rubrics and metrics, unrubrics and unmetrics,
because a radically other-world requires radically other means to love
it, to caress it, to be all the way in it So why is there no "end"?
**[To assert this might seem to sidestep what Foucault claims in the
Preface of Anti-Oedipus]{.underline}**: **[to be]{.underline}** "less
**[concerned with why this or that than with how to
proceed]{.underline}**." Refusing to bank on the "end" is, at least in
part, how to proceed. "**[An abdication of political
responsibility?"]{.underline}** Moten and Harney write, anticipating the
accusation. **["OK. Whatever]{.underline}**. **[We're just
anti-politically romantic about actually existing social
life]{.underline}**." **[One's concern must be an ethical one
that]{.underline}**, I want to submit, **[perhaps in supplementation to
an oversight in Moten and Harney]{.underline}**, not only sets its
sights on social life that "actually" (I shiver at the implicit hubris
of this word, its presumptive facticity) exists but, more substantively,
fertilizes the conditions of possibility for otherwise and unsung and
unknown emergence. **[There is no "end" because to know the end is to
think one knows the totality of the landscape]{.underline}**, **[a line
of thinking that in fact cannot account for that which falls outside of
the dictates of existential]{.underline}** and ontological
**[legibility]{.underline}**. **[There might always be something else
just outside]{.underline}**, **[and we cannot foreclose the
discussion]{.underline}** when we think it is over. Fugitive planning
plans for what it cannot plan for by refusing to plan for it. So there
is no end in sight because sight is not the only sense available to us.
(But there is also no end in touch, smell, feel, or taste---or any other
proprioceptive sensibilities.) There is no end in sight because our end
may only be someone else's beginning, another's middle. Thus, our
**[critical praxis]{.underline}**, our **[interrogative social
enactment]{.underline}**, **[does something precisely when it commits to
a political endeavor that is not in its own interest or]{.underline}**
the interest of the **[purportedly most marginalized]{.underline}**;
**[it is doing something when it commits to proliferating
life]{.underline}** where no life is said to be found.

Constructing the passionate Other, then, serves a vital function for the
Liberal Self. [The Other provides an easy target not just for Europe's
guns, ships, and trade but also a moral and physical landscape on which
to project all those passions and desires not allowed at home by the
dour Protestantism.]{.underline} The Other has none of what Europeans
could identify as "civilization": a Leviathan-like state ("this land is
free!"), religious virtue through self-denial ("they have no morals"),
codified laws to establish order ("they cannot govern themselves"), and
most importantly, repression of "the passions" ("they're animals").
[With Liberal and Neoliberal modernization as doctrine for economic
development since the late 19th century, the Other is seen to lack all
those qualities assigned to the Western, capitalist Self: "rationality,"
"impersonal decision-making," "specialization"]{.underline} (cf. Banuri
1990). [Liberals extend Hobbes' State of Nature to the
world.]{.underline} Since no global Leviathan exists, a "warre of all
against all" must prevail in world politics. [Accordingly, fear and
insecurity of theft, murder, or domination by Others requires a strong,
domestic Leviathan.]{.underline} The Liberal state thus takes on the
autonomous, singular, and self-defined "sovereignty" of the individual
in the State of Nature who, as Hobbes put it, springs forth "like
mushrooms after a rain." This Liberal presumption runs deep. **[Even
those who identify themselves by another theoretical tradition, like
Alexander Wendt (2005) with constructivism, reveal their Liberal stripes
by stipulating that the state must take on the "sovereign" attributes of
a "person" to be held accountable for its actions.]{.underline}**
Counter-intuitively, [Liberals claim to herald an era of "democratic
peace."6 Liberal capitalism's emphasis on uninterrupted transactions,
they contend, maintain mutually-beneficial returns on investment that
raises the stakes for war thereby discouraging it]{.underline}; indeed,
capitalism actually effects the opposite by encouraging cooperation even
under conditions of international anarchy (Keohane 1984). Both
domestically and internationally, capitalist market practices produce
all the fundaments of a democratic society: e.g., a "revolutionary"
middle class, an active civil society, rational pursuit of individual
interest that leads to self-censoring collective action, rule of law,
and so on (Olson 1993; Held 1995). Globalization, as another venue for
Liberal capitalism, embeds democracy "in the depths of people's hearts
and minds" (Sakamoto 1991: 122). Liberals are able to do so only through
its Other. By mystifying or denying its own desires and passions
(Crawford 2000), [Liberals can claim that their states are ruled by
"rational," "objective" interests that promote "democracy" and
"rule]{.underline} of law." Indeed, the Liberal inter-state system can
be understood formally, mathematically, and impartially (cf. King,
Keohane, and Verba 1994).7 In fencing off "passion" for the cultural,
historical, colonized Other, Liberals fold colonial power relations
conveniently into a capitalist world order run by rational elites.
Indeed, for Uday Mehta (1997), [Liberalism has always utilized
"strategies of exclusion" to sustain the bourgeois order. Now the same
logic and practice, he suggests, are applied to world
politics]{.underline}. **[Where previously Liberals subordinated and
exploited domesticated identities in term of gender (e.g., women) and
class (e.g., workers),8 Liberalism exported to the world at large now
takes on racial, sexual, and cultural characteristics.]{.underline}**
[It targets externalized Others like India, for instance, by labeling it
"inscrutable," "child-like," or "barbaric]{.underline}." Accordingly,
the Indian Other needs to be defined and educated by the all-knowing,
worldly, civilized West. [Neoliberalism jazzes up dour, penny-pinching
**Protestant capitalism to emphasize its multicultural, youthful, and
trendy pleasures. Note how the Coca Cola Company, one of capitalism's
enduring icons, captures this Neoliberal appeal with effective
advertising**]{.underline} slogans over the years. A sample from the end
of the Cold War in 1989 to the present indicates the easy, everyday
allure promised by and associated with a bottle of Coke: 1990: You Can't
Beat the Real Thing 2001: Life Tastes Good 2005: Make it Real9 2006:
Welcome to the Coke Side of Life [**Under Neoliberal globalization,
"difference" is marketed into "sameness."** Much like the Benetton ads
featuring good-looking youths from different races, ethnicities, and
cultures but all, nonetheless, wearing the latest Italian
fashions,]{.underline} **[Neoliberals wipe out the violent history that
produced our differentiations of "race/ethnicity" in the first
place]{.underline}** or the fact that the Italian clothing industry
enjoys far greater profits and standing in the global marketplace than,
say, an Ethiopian one. [In this way, Neoliberalism manages difference
into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western-capitalist, consumer-based
"goodness."]{.underline} Another example comes from the United Nations
Development Programme's (UNDP) 2004 Human Development Report, Cultural
Liberty in Today's Diverse World. [It calls for valuing "cultural
diversity" in all its "vitality" but defeats the UNDP's own purpose by
defining identity in Neoliberal terms only: e.g., "\[c\]ultural liberty
is a vital part of human development because being able to choose one's
identity -- who one is -- without losing the respect of others or being
excluded from other choices is important in leading a full
life]{.underline}" (emphases added, p. 1). [**Identity here becomes a
singular, self-enclosed** social signifier with a right to
representation]{.underline} -- much like the right to consume goods --
in order to lead a "full" life, thereby requiring state-protected
tolerance and other virtues of Liberal pluralism. [We define identity as
a collective legacy, not individual choice]{.underline}. This legacy,
moreover, results from interactions among and within multiple legacies
which themselves are products of such interactions in the past.
[Tolerance in this case is nice but]{.underline} problematic. [It
renders invisible the power plays necessary for "tolerance" to take hold
in the first place. What we need is a concrete working-through of
contending terms of being so that we may sustain and generate
connections for generations to come. **Simply negotiating "turf rights"
between majorities and minorities misses the point and merely postpones
the struggles to come.**]{.underline}

#### Our model of debate resists capitalism and neoliberalism through the attentiveness of care -- our affirmative prefigures counter-capitalist cultures of care that resist the family as the only organizing principle of capitalist social life.

Introduction [The social and cultural reproduction of neoliberalism is
in crisis. [The labour required to reproduce neoliberalism's 'conditions
of possibility' is increasingly onerou]{.mark}s]{.underline} (see Fisher
2009; 17; Lazzarato 2009) [[and]{.mark} [responsibility for]{.mark}
managing [this workload continues to be
individualized]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Berlant 2011[),
[feminized]{.mark}]{.underline} (Federici 2006) [[and
outsourced]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nguyen, Zavoretti, and Tronto 2017,
200). Neoliberal [[systems rely on increasingly violent extractive
practices to cultivate new markets]{.mark}, [with disastrous
environmental, cultural and social impacts]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
Lyons, Tager, and Sales 2016). The capitalist futures that once seemed
stable and inevitable (though always already exclusive and illusory)2
are now firmly in crisis (see Berlant 2011; 2; Fisher 2009; 2--3). In
this article, members of the Brisbane Free University (BFU) and Queering
Health Hobart (QHH) explore the [[contradictions of this messy present
through feminist theories of care]{.mark}.]{.underline} In particular,
we draw on our own experiences as participants in these 'alternative
spaces of teaching and learning' (Thompsett 2017, 25) [[to think about
the **labour of social reproduction and the contradictions of caring
under, against and beyond capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fraser
2016, 99; Bellacasa 2017, 1). We draw out three key values of
prefigurative, counter-capitalist care: attentiveness, locatedness and
relationality. We explore those values in relation to the looming crises
of capitalism. [[In small and quiet ways,]{.mark} these [values
reproduce subjects and cultures that disrupt the reproduction of
neoliberal logics]{.mark}. By [attending to one another **in the
specific conditions of the 'here and now', we begin to prefigure
counter-capitalist cultures of care**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Accidental)
autoethnography: research as care labour in the 'here and now' This
article draws on rich traditions of queer, feminist and anti-colonial
autoethnographic research (Butz 2010; Mountz et al. 2015).
[[Autoethnography]{.mark} is a method of [self observation, looking at
our everyday practices to develop social and political
theory]{.mark}]{.underline} (Osborne and Grant-Smith 2017). It is [[a
fluid kind of inquiry]{.mark}, focused on the everyday ways communities
figure out how to act in the present.]{.underline} In our case, this
article represents our attempts to explore 6 years of accidental
autoethnographic research (see Poulos 2010; Fujii 2015) in prefigurative
free education projects. Our reflections here are inseparable from years
of conversation and shared theorizing in these spaces.4 These ideas have
been produced collectively, and our fellow participants are actively
engaged in 'theorising their own experiences' (Macoun and Miller 2014,
287). While we remain responsible for the specific content of this
article, we acknowledge that this work is entirely contingent on these
ongoing community discussions.5 We delivered a version of this article
at the CSAA6 Cultures of Capitalism conference in Aotearoa in December
2017. In the discussion that followed our presentation, another
conference participant asked us to expand on how care operated in these
projects. This article is a longer response to that generous
questioner[. [We hope that this response]{.mark} also [serves as a
prompt]{.mark} for those of us engaged in prefigurative7 political
projects, [to acknowledge care as political practice]{.mark}, and to
[think about its role in building viable communities in the
ecologically, economically and ethically precarious present. Learning to
care]{.mark}:]{.underline} thinking free education practices through
ethics of care [[Social reproductive labour]{.mark} historically
[includes things like 'caring for friends and family members,
maintaining households and broader communities, and sustaining
connections more generally']{.mark}]{.underline} (Fraser 2016, 99[).
[Under neolib]{.underline}]{.mark}[eralism, [this labour has expanded to
include the ephemeral work of individual
'brand-building']{.mark}]{.underline} (Fisher 2009),
[['self-care',]{.underline}]{.mark} (Bakker 2007, 542) [[and digital
social labour]{.underline}]{.mark} (Dyer-Witheford 2015). [[This]{.mark}
predominantly [un- or underpaid, feminized]{.mark} and [globalized
work]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bellacasa 2017) is [[central to the operation
and reproduction of neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Fraser
(2016) theorizing, [this work is [thus significant because it reveals a
crisis tendency in capitalist social reproduction:]{.mark} a 'crisis of
care' with overlapping 'economic, ecological and political strands, all
of which intersect with and exacerbate one another']{.underline} (Fraser
2016, 99). In this section, we use our experiences as participants in
free education projects to ask how forms and practices of care can build
the conditions of possibility for alternative, counter-capitalist
cultural and political systems. [[Conceptions and cultures of care are
'deeply implicated in existing structures of power and
inequality']{.underline}]{.mark} (Robinson 2011, 3), [[and care has been
a focal point of feminist]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fraser 2016),
[[queer]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bellacasa 2017) [[and critical race
theory]{.underline}]{.mark} (Collins 2000) [[and feminist urban
justice]{.mark}]{.underline} (Williams 2017, 821). How care is used in
prefigurative political spaces makes visible both the values and norms
that these spaces foster, as well as their contradictions. Do our
practices of care simply facilitate neoliberal cultural expansion? Can
they disrupt neoliberal logics even as they are absorbed or surrounded
by them? And [in the face of a 'crisis of care']{.underline} (Fraser
2016, 99), [[how do we practice militant forms of
care]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fraser 2013) [[that make visible alternative
social relations, rather than simply 'plugging the leaks' in
neoliberalism?]{.underline}]{.mark} BFU and QHH Both BFU and QHH are
'permanent experiments' (Thompsett 2016, 62), growing from complex
relationships to institutions of health and education. BFU began in
November 2012 in the 'empty concrete box' (Sri 2013) of a car park
underneath a bank, in Brisbane's inner-city suburb West End. It hatched
slowly, through long conversations and shared wonder. We hoped that BFU
might be a space in which we could 'reimagine education (. . .)
challenge the divide between the academic sphere and the public forum,
between the sandstone and the street corner' (BFU 2012).8 Over the past
6 years, BFU has hosted numerous free lectures, workshops and public
discussions in public spaces, often in collaboration with other
community organizations. We have also facilitated a weekly radical
reading group and an activist research collective (BFU 2012). QHH is a
reading group consisting of health(care) workers, university students
from diverse disciplines and members of Hobart's LGBTQIA + community.
Together, this deeply cross-disciplinary collective is interrogating the
pressures of institutional 'efficiency' on the goals of patient-centred
care, seeking to explore and pursue approaches to healthcare that centre
difference. QHH arises first from an interest in 'queer health', that
is, the health and well-being of people of non-normative sexualities
and/or genders. However, the group is also driven by a desire to queer
health: to think through contemporary health practices and industries
and the concept of health through queer theory, with an eye on 'the
normative, alienating, even damaging and iatrogenic9 assumptions that
are perpetuated in modern healthcare' (Brendelow 2014, viii). QHH stands
in critique of the lack of meaningful diversity training (Ahmed and Swan
2006, 96) and the limitations of efficiency-driven public institutions,
such as universities and hospitals, to respond with care to the situated
and variable needs of communities and individuals. In its early days,
the reading group met fortnightly in an empty classroom at the
university. The reading group was therefore subject to the limits of
scavenged institutional space, including hasty last-minute rescheduling
and the possibility of late-comers being accidentally locked out of the
building if they arrived after the campus was 'secured' for the night.
Seeking a location that might feel more welcoming to people from outside
of the academy, the group currently meets in borrowed space above a
local pub. Both of these projects have tapped into a resurgence in
prefigurative political organizing, particularly free universities,
radical reading groups and creative urban relocations and occupations
(Graeber 2009, 84; Davis et al. 2011, 76; Avrich and Pateman 1995; Bey
2003). So while [[these]{.underline} [projects]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[linked]{.mark} [in some ways to]{.mark} energetic processes of
n[eoliberal enclosure within the university]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Osborne and Grant-Smith 2017, 60--61; Lyons, Tager, and Sales 2016) and
the health system (McGregor 2001, 82), they [[do not exist wholly in
opposition to these formal sites. Rather, they gather material, strength
and inspiration from other prefigurative and anti-oppressive political
structures, including worldwide Occupy movement]{.mark}s[, free
universities, prison abolition organizing and Indigenous
activism]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as that of the Brisbane Aboriginal
Sovereign Embassy and the Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance). QHH
also draws from a depth of history and activism around gender and sexual
diversity (along with other bodily differences), including the Gay
Liberation movement and its contemporary permutations, fat activism and
the Disability Rights Movement. [[These inheritances orient
us]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ahmed 2006, 545) [[toward]{.mark} political
[action situated in the material conditions of the present, unwilling to
separate the political 'ends' from means]{.mark}. They [remind us to
think about how to produce alternative 'sites of possibility' to disrupt
or undermine neoliberal hegemony]{.mark}. We now investigate these
'sites of possibility' [through the interrelated practices of
relationality, attentiveness and locatedness.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Relationality A [[feminist 'ethics of care']{.underline}]{.mark}
(Robinson 2011, 3) [[encourages us to take relational motivations
seriously as crucial features of ethical decision-making]{.mark}. An
ethics of care [describes a way of asking questions about justice
through relationships and responsibilities]{.mark}. This reflects
[conceptions of ethical agency that see all of us as 'interdependent and
as having the potential and responsibility to be caring and cared
for']{.mark}]{.underline} (Williams 2001, 478). In comparison, [l[iberal
(and neoliberal) models]{.underline}]{.mark} [of justice [are]{.mark}
often [framed around 'legalistic principles that assume individuals are
independent and atomistic beings']{.mark}]{.underline} (Williams 2001,
478) [who [focus on abstract rights and rules in making ethical
decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[values and norms associated with
and reflected in feminist ethics of care also valorize
specificity]{.mark}:]{.underline} as Featherstone and Morris (2012, 341)
point out, [feminist ethics of care [develop theories of value that are
'tied to concrete circumstances rather than philosophical
abstractions']{.mark}.]{.underline} In BFU and QHH, feminist ethics of
care manifest in our [[explicit acknowledgment that]{.mark} the
organizer is more important than the organizing, [the activist valuable
beyond their capacity for activism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Organizers and
participants of BFU and QHH have always maintained that these projects
will not continue if they become unduly burdensome or stressful, or if
they put a strain on the relationships that underpin them. As
organizers, we have each gone through periods of little or no
involvement with these projects, and periods of intensive engagement.
[[By thinking about free education projects as complex webs of
intertwining and overlapping relationships of care, we see a telos that
is relational rather than abstract.]{.underline} BFU]{.mark} and QHH
also resist neoliberal logics of success by refusing to identify key
outcomes or performance indicators (Brown 2015, 2). Both spaces push
against progress narratives that require expansion or 'scaling up'
(Srnicek and Williams 2016). Many of the early conversations within the
BFU included discussions of how to expand the project into the outer
suburbs, or to other cities, and many participants were eager to see the
project grow and take root in other places. These expansions never
really happened, despite the enthusiasm of some participants.10 In
thinking about BFU through the lens of care, we suggest that these
anti-expansionist decisions might be understood both as a result of
pragmatic factors (that the main organizers simply did not have the
energy to set up in communities where we knew no one and had no existing
relationships) as well as an important expression of the values of
relationality and locatedness. [Commonly [under capitalism,]{.mark} and
increasingly with the rise of precarious labour]{.underline} (Lazzarato
2009, 110), [[people are regarded as replaceable or interchangeable
units]{.mark}, 'human resources'. [Place and environment are]{.mark}
also [marketized: where we live and organize is simply the 'blank
slate']{.mark} [on which new markets might take form. We]{.mark}
strongly [desire not to replicate these careless neoliberal dynamics
within these projects.]{.mark}]{.underline} Through organizing free
education projects, we have experienced beyond refute that those we care
about are not interchangeable or reducible to resources. We have learnt
that [[the places in which we live and organize are made up of complex
webs of unpredictable human and more]{.mark}-than-human
[relationships,]{.mark} and that sometimes those relationships intersect
with organizing practices.]{.underline}11 These experiences have made
visible to us the messy histories of ideas and environments and bodies,
lineages that intersect with colonial and capitalist trajectories
(Moreton-Robinson 2012; Behrendt 2008; Todd 2016) and resistances to
them. In learning to learn with these histories, we have experienced
alternative, careful relationships to place and people. Attentiveness
[[The desire to care for each other also leads us to pay attention to
the specific conditions of the 'here and now']{.underline}.]{.mark} For
feminist ethicist Joan Tronto, '[[the first moral aspect of
caring]{.mark} [is attentiveness. . .]{.mark} \[a\]ttentiveness, simply
[recognizing the needs of those around us,]{.mark} is [a difficult
task,]{.mark} and indeed, a moral achievement']{.underline} (Tronto
1993, 127). To recognize the need for care takes time to focus and
engage. To act on this recognition asks more time again. [[Attentiveness
is slow]{.mark}. It [cuts against]{.mark} the grain of [capitalist
temporalities,]{.mark} timelines which are so often driven by efficiency
and progress (Brown 2015, 10) and [characterized by anxiousness,
restlessness and carelessness]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fisher 2009, 7). As
participants in and organizers of free universities and radical reading
groups, we learn to pay attention to (and thus value) practices and
knowledges that directly oppose and actively undermine forms of
colonial, racial and capitalist violence (MoretonRobinson 2012; Martin
Nakata et al. 2012). [But [we also learn for the sake of
learning]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} for [its capacity to bring joy and
meaning to our relationships in the present.]{.mark} It is [through our
experiences of learning to be attentive]{.mark} to different things that
[we open up space for 'other possibilities']{.mark}]{.underline} (New
York based activist Joe Kay, interviewed in Thompsett 2017). In a
practical sense, [these 'other possibilities' are [made visible in the
fundamentally different material and affective experiences of learning
that take place in free education spaces.]{.mark}]{.underline} Learning
at BFU or QHH looks, feels, even smells different from other kinds of
learning. In part, this is because the lines between 'teachers' and
'learners' are blurred by the relationships that underpin these
projects. It is also, we suggest, because we are called upon in these
spaces to pay attention to different things, and acknowledge different
agencies. As one participant, Jonathan, wrote in a submission to a zine
produced by BFU (Sri 2013): the line between organisers and audience
members had been attacked with bleach and a scrubbing brush. I think if
someone had marched in and yelled out: "Who's in charge here?" there
would've been an awkward pause where no one moved, and then suddenly
absolutely everybody would have thrown up their hands and claimed
responsibility' Attentiveness in free education spaces also means paying
attention to the dynamics operating within the space; the 'background'
(Ahmed 2006) affective and material labour that makes learning possible
(Thompsett 2017). In a comment on an earlier draft of this article, one
BFU reading group participant commented on a practice of one of the
other long-term participants, who arrives every week with a stack of
beautiful porcelain tea cups and saucers, a large metal teapot, tea
leaves and fresh milk, often in addition to a home-made cake or
biscuits. The participant wrote that 'his quiet attentiveness to making
sure that people's cups are filled, and how he remembers how everyone
takes their tea, is this incredible and lovely recognition of learning
as embodied, learners-as-bodies'. Another (anonymous) submission to the
earlier BFU zine reminded us of 'some things. . .we could ask ourselves
when embarking on free university adventures' (Brisbane Free University
Participants 2013). These included the provocation to check whether
'hearts and heads' were staying in 'close communication'; and whether
our 'classroom' reflected the kind of world we were imagining (Brisbane
Free University Participants 2013). [The significance of attentiveness,
and therefore of slowness, relates also to the theoretical engagements
taking place within these projects**. [In resistance to the hurried
scholarship of profit-oriented universities, we strive to hold open
spaces in which to experiment with thinking and learning without the
pressure to rush to conclusions or justify time
spent]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Michelle Boulous Walker (2017, xiv), in
her vital engagement with questions of slowness and scholarship,
explains: '\[u\]nder situations of high time pressure, it becomes more
and more difficult to engage with the complex and difficult in
substantial and intense ways'. In embracing slowness and rejecting
notions of linear progress, free universities and radical reading groups
resist the commodification of processes of learning[. While [capitalist
temporalities continue to haunt our lives and projects, these forms of
attentiveness foster small alternatives, cracks in the concrete of
neoliberalization ]{.mark}]{.underline}[(]{.mark}see Fisher 2009[).
[They lead us away from logics of efficiency]{.mark} [and productivity
toward relationships of care]{.mark} and carefulness.]{.underline} In
thinking about these practices of attentiveness (slowness, wonder,
curiosity, care), we see different ways of thinking and working
together. [These [glimpses provide sustenance for our
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} (within and outside conventional
universities) [[and glimmers of hope for our collective futures]{.mark}.
Locatedness Space and place have risen as major forces within the
projects, initially through practical challenges.]{.underline} For BFU,
the desire to avoid buying time in commercial meeting places has
oriented us towards public spaces, and failing that, borrowed spaces.
This early [interest [in **'reclaiming' or 're-occupying' the public
realm**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Davis et al. 2011) oriented us toward
engaging with the specificity of Brisbane's urban realm. The particular
difficulty we experienced (and continue to experience) in trying to find
free, public spaces in which we can meet spoke to the rapid enclosure of
the urban public realm through neoliberal processes of gentrification
and privatization (Harvey 2008, 3). These practical difficulties lead us
to ask deeper questions about the political and economic governance of
Brisbane public spaces, and to engage with the historical (and ongoing)
dynamics that shape this settler colonial city (Strakosch 2015; Brand,
Bond, and Shannon 2016). As white settler women in urban Australia,
organizing free education projects in Brisbane's public realm has meant
thinking about colonialism, enclosure and boundaries (see Meyerhoff and
Thompsett 2017). Since it started in 2012, BFU has occupied a series of
spaces along West End's 'Boundary Street'. This street is so-named
because it represents the historical boundary line between the colonial
city and the Aboriginal encampment: the heavily surveilled, policed and
regulated 'boundary' of the city (Brand, Bond, and Shannon 2016; Birch
2010). Brisbane has more Boundary Streets than any other city in
Australia, many of which still bear their historical name, and many of
which continue to be sites of surveillance and over-policing of
Indigenous people (Brand, Bond, and Shannon 2016). These 'boundaries'
encircle the inner city, demarcating and commemorating colonial
histories of (attempted) enclosure, containment and dispossession (M.
Mitropoulos, personal communication, March 28, 2017) . They remind us,
as Povinelli (2017, 31) writes, that boundaries, like frontiers,
'operate as a way of imagining space so that various things can be done
there'. Of course, Boundary Streets are also a key sites of Indigenous
resistance, and West End's Boundary Street has an active and thriving
Indigenous presence (Brand, Bond, and Shannon 2016). The area around
Boundary Street, the Kurilpa peninsula, also has deep (pre-colonial and
continuing) significance for Jagera and Turrbal people as a traditional
meeting point, ceremonial ground and area of trade (Connors 2015). One
of the spaces that BFU regularly uses is called 'People's Park', a small
park close to the centre of Boundary Street. The park was the site of an
art project by local Aboriginal community members, as a stand against
processes of gentrification that saw 'minority groups, Indigenous
groups, the homeless community and low income earners. . .moved out of
the local area' (State Library of Queensland 2018). With support from
the local councillor, community members painted a large mural in the
park, to serve as a reminder that the area is 'steeped in Aboriginal
history, even though the demographics and aesthetics have changed
dramatically over the past few years' (State Library of Queensland
2018). [In [thinking about the significance of place to
counter-capitalist cultures of care,]{.mark} we take up Ahmed's (2006)
suggestion that [the background]{.mark} -- the histories -- is 'what
[allows what comes into view to be viewed']{.mark}.]{.underline} Martin
Nakata et al. (2012, 123--124) also emphasize the importance of the
'field of vision', calling on a radical practice of historicization to
explore the possibilities of 'decolonial knowledge-making' in which 'the
Western' is able to be 'made sense of' as a specific cultural and
political project. This focus on the specificity of place and knowledge,
and their co-constitution and co-production, enables us, as Stephen
Muecke (2012) describes it, to 'keep things alive in their place'. In
learning to pay close attention to place and space, we learn -- as
anthropologist Jeffrey Juris notes -- 'a kind of self-reflexivity, to
think about who we are, and how we relate and interact with the world'
(interviewed in Thompsett 2017, 28). This reflexivity has taken varied
forms. In June 2016, for example, we set up in a small park in the
middle of Boundary Street in Brisbane's West End for a talk called
Decolonising the City, with several Indigenous activists, writers and
artists. We set up, as we usually did, with chairs in loose rows, facing
forward towards a speaker. When the speakers and participants arrived,
they immediately set about moving the chairs into a circle, and they
opened the conversation by asking each of the 50 or so participants to
locate themselves in relation to one another and the place, by way of a
'where is home for you' introduction. In the informal conversation that
followed the discussion, several participants drew attention to the
spatial transformation that had happened within the free university
during that session. Many of us reflected on how different it had felt
in comparison to other free university talks; how transformative it was
to be asked this question in this space, to be reminded of our own
(varied) 'inheritances' (Ahmed 2006, 545) as we gathered to think about
urban decolonization. Locating ourselves in the 'here and now' has been
vital to these projects. For BFU participants and organizers --
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, white settler and migrant Australians,
folks of colour, homeless folks and refugee communities -- 'learning' on
Boundary Street requires us to see these violent histories of the urban
realm as alwaysalready in conversation with academic work and theory. No
matter how varied the topics covered by BFU talks (from moral philosophy
or feminist aesthetics to political economics and harmony-singing
workshops), they are always grounded in the material
interpersonal/relational conditions of the 'here and now'. Given that
neoliberal expansion so often functions through particular spatial
imaginaries of placelessness, hypermobility and globalization (Giles and
Carlson 2017, 8), this ethic of groundedness compels us to 'stay with
the trouble' (Haraway 2016) of our violent and messy present. For QHH,
the spatial relationship to both the university campus and broader
LGBTQIA + communities is significant. As the last state in Australia to
decriminalize homosexuality, Tasmania has a powerfully homophobic
history. The presence of a vigorous LGBTQIA + community and the positive
state-level outcome of the 2017 Same Sex Marriage (SSM) Survey suggests
that Tasmanian activists have been successful in generating cultural
change. However, decisions made by the University of Tasmania (UTas) in
the run-up to the SSM survey (the time period in which QHH arose)
suggests that it might be too soon to relegate Tasmanian homophobia to
the history books. Having at no stage voiced specific support for
LGBTQIA + staff and students, UTas rented campus space to an anti-SSM
campaign group (Ferwerda et al. 2017). These events damaged the sense of
belonging on campus for queer staff and students. This is deeply
significant for QHH, as a free education project already questioning the
capacity of both the university and healthcare systems to care for and
about the full range of human difference. Under these conditions,
choosing initially to meet on campus was imbued with a sense of
significance, even resistance. However, the desire that all members of
the diverse communities the group seeks to centre should feel equally
comfortable in our meeting spaces has since taken the group off campus.
QHH are now growing community and knowledges together in a borrowed
space above a pub. You can imagine how we laughed when we first saw it
and realised we\'d booked a board room. The lessons of space and place
that QHH negotiate do not end there. Attentiveness to place also guides
us toward intersectional thinking. In learning to care for one another
in the here and now, we inevitably meet at intersections (Collins 2000).
The land on which we meet and learn is nipaluna (Tasmanian Aboriginal
Centre 2018). In all we do, we stand in commitment to this place, and to
the unceded sovereignty of the muwinina people. We acknowledge the
custodial rights and responsibilities of the palawa peoples (Riawunna
Centre for Aboriginal Education, 2018), and Elders past, present and
future. Tasmania is a place with its own distinct and devastating
colonial history of attempted genocide of the Indigenous population,
followed by erasure, both of the attempted genocide itself and of the
enduring resilience and resistance of survivors and descendants (Lehman
2018; Sculthorpe and Mansell 2008).Our location on this unceded land, as
well as our engagements with Indigenous participants, communities and
theorists, reminds us that the question of what meaningfully queering
health might look like inHobart must engage with our colonial contexts
and complicities. Otherwise, we risk reinforcing some oppressions even
while pursuing the alleviation of others (see Morgensen 2011). In order
to stand within the tensions and potentialities of thinking with and
through queerness in this place, we read and listen to the words of
those who live at the intersections of queerness and Indigeneity (Baylis
2014; Clark 2015). Of course, these projects are permanent experiments,
and we are always still learning how to engage ethically in this place.
But it is through organizing in these places and communities at we learn
the importance of grounding and locating ourselves in the material
conditions of the present, and taking seriously the challenges and
contradictions that presents. Conclusions [[In thinking about practices
of free education through feminist theories of care, we are learning
what care is and how we might create and sustain
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} As we experiment with prefigurative political
projects, we are experimenting in our own becoming, and that of our
communities. We have found ourselves, and each other, striving in small
and intimate ways to live and learn together. We find moments beyond the
brutal carelessness of neoliberalism, small tastes of something better.
[In [thinking about how we care for one another in these spaces, we
reject political projects that separate means from ends, treating the
'here and now' as simply a testing ground for future expansion.]{.mark}
As capitalist social reproduction falters and corresponding future
imaginaries buckle under the weight of grief and precarity, we stop
where and when we are, and turn towards each other.]{.underline} We have
found in free education projects small and everyday opportunities to
(re)produce counter-capitalist cultures of care. Increasingly, we take
up these opportunities where we find them. Following Paulo Freire, great
figure of emancipatory pedagogies, we work in the present for 'the
creation of a world in which it will be easier to love' (1970).

Fortier presents the work of Ruben
**[Gaztambide-Fernandez]{.underline}** who **[reminds us
that]{.underline}** \"**[individual subjects do not enter]{.underline}**
into **[relationships]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** rather
**[subjects are made in and through relationships]{.underline}**\" (47).
**[It\'s this \'double bind\' that we struggle with when working
against]{.underline}** and **[beyond systems of
injustice]{.underline}**, **[while also being within
them]{.underline}**. For me, **[the stress with these relationships is
to]{.underline}** critically **[examine how our national, consumer,
citizen, neighbor, and]{.underline}** even **[activist identities are
constructed through ongoing political forces.]{.underline}** What
languages hold in our work? Do we use American or Canadian english
spelling? What kind of national currency do we use and what value is
this money based in? Do we honour political boundaries more than
ecological ones? Do we consider how our actions impact non-human life
and the lives of future generations? What do we really know (when it
comes to Indigenous identity and authority) about the lands and waters
we call home? **[These are just some]{.underline}** the **[relationships
that shape us and maintain]{.underline}** (or possibly resist)
**[colonization]{.underline}**. Appropriating practices are also common
between progressive movements and Indigenous ways of knowing and being.
Environmental ethics, participatory democracy, gender equity, and
inter-national mutualism are the core of left-ist ideals. Because
**[western culture]{.underline}** has lost its cultural roots, it
**[absorbs foreign practices and]{.underline}** then **[claims them as
its own]{.underline}**. **[How many examples do we have of white
men]{.underline}** **[\'discovering\' something or someone that already
exists]{.underline}**? Even if the practice of sharing and sustaining a
commons was rooted in indigenous European life, what parts can and
cannot be transplanted? GLC\'s Charter Declaration starts with \"We, the
People of the Great Lakes\" which mimics parts of the U.S. Constitution.
This Charter was a collaborative effort between native and non-native
water protectors and the language (while created and shared only in
English for many years) reflects Indigenous and commons ethics and
desires. While the Charter is now in 5 Great Lakes languages, how might
it appropriate Indigenous teachings or even evade or naturalize them? Or
does it honor these teachings, value the spirit of collaboration, and
start to unsettle Great Lakes governance? Let us know in the comments
section. Fortier and **[several]{.underline}** other
**[activists]{.underline}** in the book **[want us to focus on
the]{.underline}** types of respectful **[relationship-building that is
needed]{.underline}** when adapting Indigenous nation-making into their
struggles. Fortier offers 3 ways we can re-imagine \'the commons\': as a
practice, a place, and as a relationship. When speaking to Essex Lordes
and Li Morales (organizers within queer POC struggles in the Bay area)
the tendency to homogenize practices of commoning should be questioned.
Instead, practices that are both caring and destabilizing give us a way
forward (60). Unsettling water governance, for example, insists on the
contingency of the settler state and its powers and projections into the
future. Compared to the unity of coalition politics, this
**[destabilization aligns with]{.underline}** Eva Tuck and K. Wayne
Yang\'s **[call for \'uncommonality\']{.underline}** (61). In order to
decolonize, the political paths of Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
can diverge. Comparing the practices of allies versus accomplices,
Fortier and others highlight the need for settlers to \'unmake\' those
relationships that maintain colonial power. Using **[the example of the
Tar Sands Healing Walks]{.underline}**, Fortier **[shows us an
Indigenous/Settler fight against fossil fuels that is led by Indigenous
women and reconnects]{.underline}** everyone **[to land]{.underline}**
and water **[through ceremony]{.underline}**. **[This walk was not a
protest]{.underline}**. **[This was not a reclaiming of the
commons.]{.underline}** This was not asking for settler permission or
recognition. Being an accomplice in decolonization should expose the
normalized, violent, and ongoing erasure of Indigenous futures. The
settler\'s positionality within this crime should be a practice of both
refusal and realignment. Looking beyond the book, the Great Lakes have
Sacred Water Walks led by women, Great Lakes gatherings, and decolonial
water projects that are continental and local. There are Treaty
Workshops and decolonial maps being made. There are decolonial legal
challenges and legal knowledges centering Indigenous power and there are
toxic walking tours close to Indigenous reserves/reservations. The list
goes on but the point is the same. When it comes to water protection and
authority, what practices unsettle the colonial processes? So the
**[practices of commoning need to destabilize settler
relationships]{.underline}**, but what about how commoning relates to
place? Much of GLC\'s work is reframing water governance from \'resource
management\' to \'life source reciprocity\' \-- to put it most simply.
The commons framework creates opportunities beyond public or private
ownership and celebrates the unifying thread between past, present and
future generations. Over the years GLC has shifted from a more secular
understanding (perhaps a European bias) of the commons to a commons that
is both shared and sacred. We are not \'reclaiming a commons\' but
making one within the context of \'the\' waters \-- not \'our\' water.
We support, design, and collaborate on projects that enter grateful and
reciprocal kinship with water, rather than the stewardship, management,
and conservation of water (that stress only human agency). We seek and
value learning \'from\' water, rather than just \'about\' water. Like
all water groups (mostly) lead by non-Indigenous people, we need to be
accountable to the Treaties and our positions here on Turtle island. We
welcome ideas on how to do a better job. Fortier\'s analysis uses a
\'within\', \'against\', and \'beyond\' settler-colonialism framing to
include multiple layers of political theory and action. **[Commoning in
a particular place]{.underline}** (such as the Great Lakes) **[has
taught]{.underline}** GLC **[a lot about
\'uncommonality\']{.underline}** even **[as we try and build unity and
seed disruption into]{.underline}** colonial Great Lakes
**[governance]{.underline}**. In 2017 we created a Charter Toolkit to
animate parts of our Commons Charter. Resources within, against, and
beyond the current set of relationships were made to unpack how place
matters when building a commons (rather than re-claiming one). These are
3 of 10 questions from a resource about bottled water that try to bring
theory and action together (ie, campaigns to reduce and stop the
commercialization of water). The GLC Charter includes a set of First
Principles that honor the ongoing relationships and agreements
communities (primarily Indigenous communities) have with the Great
Lakes. **[Along with commoning with a critical understanding of practice
and place]{.underline}**, Fortier explains why **[relationships are
central in the struggle]{.underline}**. **[Because settler-colonialism
is more of an ongoing current relationship rather than historical
events]{.underline}** it\'s important to name the default and desired

#### The conflicts between the US, Iran, and Israel are best explained by critical geopolitics and the logics of the family that subtend the desire to punish Iran through constructing the country as a recalcitrant child. These geopolitical representations are of more import than the 1nc's internal link chain -- in other words, we are straight turning the disad.

Arms in the 21^st^ Century," *Contemporary Security Policy,* 32:1, 24

**[In so far as Iran is building weapons and making bellicose statements
in recent years, it too may be practicing deterrence in the face of
numerous threats from Jerusalem and Washington.]{.underline}** **[The
geopolitics here is much more important than the technical matters of
precisely which historical documents the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) sees or whether the nuclear weapons program was terminated
in 2003 or not.]{.underline}** Iranians are well aware of the logic of
regime change, and the will- ingness of Americans to try this; most
Iranians remember what happened the last time it happened in Tehran when
the Shah was installed to rule after an American and British engineered
coup in the early 1950s. **[So long as the current regime isn't
recognized then tensions persist.]{.underline}** **[The Iranian view of
arms control is very different; it's based on a very different set of
geopolitical premises, and it's a geographical one preeminently, as
President Ahmadinejad makes clear in press appearances periodically.
That circular gesture of his hand, used to emphasize his points about
America staying home and not interfering in political matters on the
other side of the world, suggests very clearly a geographical mode of
'arms control'!]{.underline}** **[Viewed from Tehran the proliferation
of American weapons in the region is precisely the problem that needs to
be addressed.]{.underline}** 'The arrogant and occupying powers have
made use of all their forces, distortion, and violence for the last
decades in order to establish their control. They tried to make the
Middle East as a platform for their expansionist policies on other
regions of the world. They are satisfied to nothing but bending the
region to their will.' 30 **[In Iranian terms states should stick to
their own geographical spheres! 'Non- regional powers' are the problem,
from the occupation of Palestine to the persistence of terrorism on
Iranian soil.]{.underline}** 'My country has long been a target of
terrorism supported and encouraged by certain foreign powers. They
regard terrorism as one of the tools at their disposal to exert pressure
on countries like Iran. . . . These terrorist activities are, in part,
the result of the prevailing disorder and violence caused by foreign
invasion and interference in the region.'31 **[Indeed the logic of the
Iranian position is that the world should be a matter of sovereign
states not interfering with other states in other parts of the globe. In
this geopolitical logic, given their isolation the support of Hezbollah
as a counterweight to American containment efforts and potential Israeli
military action is a simple matter of deterrence.]{.underline}** **[If
one ignores the overblown rhetoric of President Ahmadinejad, the
geography of all this is quite simple and explains much more than the
endless arguments about the technicalities of Iranian compliance with
the IAEA.]{.underline}** **[Looking at American political relations with
Tehran, it appears that this is a narrative of the authoritarian
pedagogue. It's a matter of discipline and punishment, an insistence
that Tehran submit to American dictates on nuclear matters; the
recalcitrant child, banished to the corner of the classroom, is
repeatedly being admonished to admit the error of his ways, and renounce
his attempts to challenge the teacher's authority.]{.underline}**
**[Banishment, shame and shunning, the sanctions regime, is backed by
repeated threats to use force to make the errant child abandon its
stubborn refusal to adjust its behaviour and submit to American
authority.]{.underline}** The cane has not (yet?) been administered, but
**[clearly this coercive mode of biopolitics is about punishment, and
about what is known in the strange world of international politics as
'credibility'. Recalcitrant children are of course not to be trusted
with canes at all. At the root of the arguments about nuclear technology
is a clash of geopolitical claims; the technical questions of arms
control are secondary to this point.]{.underline}** **[But the point is
so obvious that it frequently is simply accepted as the given context

Critical geopolitics is precisely about repoliticizing the apparently

## 2AC A2 BLACK ANARCHISM

**Permutation do the aff as an instance of the neg. Refusal of the
family, interrogating us/them dichotomies and abolishing punitive logics
as a site of violence is part of the Black anarchist project.**

**Ervin 16** \[Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, "Anarchism and the Black
Revolution," *The Black Anarchism: A Reader by Black Rose Anarchist
Foundation*, February 26, 2016 //tjb\]

**[Anarchists should begin to have community forums on the cause and
manifestations of crime in the Black community.]{.underline}** **[We
have to seriously examine the social institutions: family, schools,
prisons, jobs, etc. that cause us to fuss, fight, rob and kill each
other, rather than the enemy who is causing all our
misery.]{.underline}** **[While we should mobilise to restrain
offenders, we must begin to realise that only the community will
effectively deal with the mater. Not the racist Capitalist system, with
its repressive police, courts and prisons. Only we have psychology and
understanding to deal with it; now we must develop the will. No one else
cares. Instead of eye-for eye punishment, there should be restitution to
the victims, their families or society.]{.underline}** No revenge, such
as the death penalty will bring a murder victim back, nor will long-term
imprison- ment serve either justice or the protection of society. After
all, prisons are only human trashcans for those that society has
discarded as worthless. No sane and just society would adopt such a
course. **[Society makes criminals and must be responsible for their
treatment.]{.underline}** White capitalist society is itself a crime,
and is the greatest teacher of corruption and violence. In an Anarchist
society, prisons would be done away with, along with courts and police
(except for the exceptions I have alluded to), and be replaced with
community-run programs and centres interested solely with human
regeneration and social training, rather than custodial supervision in a
inhuman lockup. The fact is that if a person is so violent or dangerous,
he is probably mentally warped or has some physical defect anyway, which
causes him to commit violent acts after social justice has been won. If
such people are mentally defective, then they should be placed in a
mental health facility, rather than a prison. Human rights should never
be stripped and he should not be punished. Schools, hospitals, doctors
and above all social equality, public welfare and liberty might prove
the safest means to get rid of crimes and criminals together. **[If a
special category such as \"criminal\" or \"enemy\" is created, then
these persons may forever feel an outcast and never
change.]{.underline}** Even if he or she is a class enemy, they should
retain all civil and human rights in society, even though they of course
would be restrained if they led a counter-revolution; the difference is
we want to defeat them ideologically, not militarily or by consigning
them to a so-called re-education camp or to be shot like the Bolsheviks
did when assuming power in Russia in 1917.

## \-\--NEG\-\--

## NEG ANSWERS -- THE FAMILY IS GOOD

#### The Black family can be reclaimed -- it can potentially serve to challenge the very hierarchies the aff critiques through opening a starting point for resistive praxis, bringing people together in a communal relationship. Reclamation of the family solves the entire aff.

**Collins '11** (Patricia Hill Collins, American academic specialising
in race, class and gender,2011,It's All in the Family:Intersection of
Gender, Race, and
Nation,[[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.66]{.underline}](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.66)
52&rep=rep1&type=p df)

Family occupies such a prominent place in the language of public
discourse in the United States that rejecting it outright might be
counterproductive for groups aiming to challenge hierarchies. Because
[[the family functions as a privileged exemplar of intersectionality in
structuring hierarchy, it potentially can serve a similar function in
challenging that hierarchy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Just as the traditional
family ideal provides a rich site for understanding intersectional
inequalities, r[[eclaiming notions of family that reject hierarchical
thinking may provide an intriguing and important site of resistance.
Many groups aim to dismantle social hierarchy, yet use unexamined ideas
about family in crafting their political programs]{.mark}. Consider how
Black nationalist-influenced projects within African-American civil
society invoke family rhetoric]{.underline}. Sociologist Paul Gilroy
(1993) notes that the \"trope of kinship\" permeates Black
understandings of culture and community to the point that
[[African-Americans largely accept the notion of race as family and work
within it.]{.underline}]{.mark} In [[Black-influenced projects, families
are seen as building blocks of the nation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
Afrocentric yearning for a homeland for the Black racial family and the
construction of a mythical Africa to serve this purpose speaks to the
use of this construct. [[Family language also shapes everyday
interactions: African-American strangers often refer to one another as
\"brother\" and \"sister\";]{.underline}]{.mark} some Black men refer to
each other as \"bloods.\" In hip-hop culture, \"homies\" are Black males
from one\'s neighborhood, or home community. [[Within this political
framework, Whites remain the strangers, the outsiders who are castigated
in Black political thought.]{.underline}]{.mark} Ironically, though the
popular press often associates the traditional family ideal with
conservative political projects, this rhetoric finds a home in what many
African-Americans consider to be the most radical of Black political
theories (Appiah 1992; Gilroy 1993). Feminist politics can contain
similar contradictions regarding family. U.S. feminists have made
important contributions in analyzing how the traditional family ideal
harms women. However, feminism\'s longing for a sisterhood among women
has proved difficult to sustain in the context of U.S. race and class
politics. Assumptions of an idealized sisterhood floundered because
women of color, among others, questioned their place in the feminist
family. Even more significant is the U.S. media\'s routine
characterization of feminism as anti-family. Although much of the
backlash against feminism claims that U.S. feminists are anti-family,
many women who are not part of this backlash probably remain suspicious
of any political movement that questions such an important social
institution by appearing to dismiss it. This is unfortunate, [[because
family rhetoric often forms a powerful language to organize people for a
variety of ends]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given the power of family as
ideological construction and principle of social organization, [[Black
nationalist, feminist, and other political movements in the United
States dedicated to challenging social inequality might consider
recasting intersectional understandings of family in ways that do not
reproduce inequality.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead of engaging in
endless criticism, reclaiming the language of family for democratic ends
and transforming the very conception of family itself might provide a
more useful approach.

#### Family is the key to the survivability of its members -- people need places to feel secure, at ease, and to be accountable to one another as a community.

**Collins '11** (Patricia Hill Collins,[American academic specialising
in race, class and gender,]{.mark} 2011,It's All in the Family:
Intersection of Gender, Race, and Nation,
[[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.6652&rep=rep1&type=p
df]{.underline}](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.6652&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

The multiple meanings attached to the concept of \"home\"-home as family
household, home as neighborhood, home as native country-speak to its
significance within family as a privileged exemplar of
intersectionality. In the United States, the traditional family ideal\'s
ideas about place, space, and territory suggest that families, racial
groups, and nation-states require their own unique places or \"homes.\"
Because [[\"homes\" provide spaces of privacy and security for families,
races, and nation-states, they serve as sanctuaries for group
members]{.underline}]{.mark}. Surrounded by individuals [[who seemingly
share similar objectives, these homes represent idealized, privatized
spaces where members can feel at ease]{.underline}]{.mark}. This view of
home requires certain gendered ideas about private and public space.
Because women are so often associated with family, home space becomes
seen as a private, feminized space that is distinct from the public,
masculinized space that lies outside its borders. [[Family space is for
members only-outsiders can be invited in only by family members or else
they are intruders]{.underline}]{.mark}. Within these gendered spheres
of private and public space, women and men again assume distinctive
roles. Women are expected to remain in their home \"place.\" Avoiding
the dangerous space of public streets allows women to care for children,
the sick, and the elderly, and other dependent family members. Men are
expected to support and defend the private, feminized space that houses
their families. Actual U.S. families rarely meet this ideal. For
example, despite 67 Hypatia feminist analyses that discredit the home as
a safe place for women, this myth seems deeply entrenched in U.S.
culture (Coontz 1992). A similar logic concerning place, space, and
territory constructs racialized space in the United States.5 Just as the
value attached to actual families reflects their placement in racial and
social class hierarchies, the neighborhoods housing these families
demonstrate comparable inequalities. Assumptions of race- and
class-segregated space mandate that U.S. families and the neighborhoods
where they reside be kept separate. Just as crafting a family from
individuals from diverse racial, ethnic, religious or class backgrounds
is discouraged, mixing different races within one neighborhood is
frowned upon. As mini-nation-states, neighborhoods allegedly operate
best when racial and/or class homogeneity prevails. [[Assigning Whites,
Blacks, and Latinos their own separate spaces reflects efforts to
maintain a geographic, racial purity]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the
dominant group, Whites continue to support legal and extra-legal
measures that segregate African-Americans, Native Americans,
Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other similar groups, thereby
perpetuating cultural norms about desirability of racial purity in
schools, neighborhoods, and public facilities. For example, tactics such
as the continual White flight out of inner cities, deploying restrictive
zoning in suburban communities in order to restrict low-income housing,
and shifting White children into private institutions in the face of
increasingly colored schools effectively maintain racially segregated
home spaces for White men, women, and children. This belief in
segregated physical spaces also has parallels to ideas about segregated
social and symbolic spaces. For example, lucrative professional
categories remain largely White and male, in part, because people of
color are seen as less capable of entering these spaces. Similarly,
keeping school curricula focused on the exploits of Whites represents
another example of ideas about segregated spaces mapped on symbolic
space. Overall, racial segregation of actual physical space fosters
multiple forms of political, economic, and social segregation (Massey
and Denton 1993). [[Securing a people\'s \"homeland\" or national
territory has long been important to nationalist
aspirations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Anthias and Yuval-Davis 1992; Calhoun
1993). After its successful anticolonial struggle against England and
its formation as a nation-state, the United States pursued a sustained
imperialist policy in order to acquire much of the land that defines its
current borders. This history of conquest illustrates the significance
of property in relations of space, place, and territory. Moreover, just
as households and neighborhoods are seen as needing protection from
outsiders, maintaining the integrity of national borders has long formed
a pillar of U.S. foreign policy. Because the United States has operated
as a dominant world power since World War II, shielding its own home
\"soil\" from warfare has been a minor theme. Instead, protecting
so-called American interests has been more prominent. Individuals and
busi68 Patricia Hill Collins nesses who occupy foreign soil represent
extensions of U.S. territory, citizens of the national family who must
be defended at all costs. Overall, by relying on the belief that
[[families have assigned places where they truly belong, images of
place, space, and territory]{.underline}]{.mark} link gendered notions
of family with constructs of race and nation (Jackson and Penrose 1993).
In this logic that everything has its place, maintaining borders of all
sorts becomes vitally important. Preserving the logic of segregated home
spaces requires strict rules that distinguish insiders from outsiders.
Unfortunately, far too often, these boundaries continue to be drawn
along the color line.

By suggesting an ideal relationship between the rights and
responsibilities of family membership, the traditional family ideal
operates as a privileged exemplar of intersectionality in yet another
way. In a situation in which notions of [[belonging to a family remain
important to issues of responsibility and
accountability]{.underline}]{.mark}, individuals feel that they \"owe\"
something to, and are responsible for, members of their families. For
example, [[people within family units routinely help their family
members by babysitting, lending money, helping relatives find employment
and housing, or caring for the elderly]{.underline}]{.mark}. Family
members linked by blood are entitled to these benefits merely by
belonging. Even when family members lack merit, they are entitled to
benefits simply because they belong. Beyond this issue of access to
entitlements, individuals incur differential responsibilities that
depend on their placement in family hierarchies. For example, women are
expected to perform much of the domestic labor that keeps the family
going, whereas men\'s duties lie in providing financial support. In a
similar fashion, U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization acquire
certain rights and responsibilities that accrue from membership.
Citizens are promised entitlements such as equal protection under the
law, access to unemployment insurance, old age pensions, free public
education, and other social welfare benefits. Citizens are also expected
to fulfill certain obligations to one another. U.S. citizens are
expected to pay taxes, observe the law, and engage in military service
when required. In contrast to the rights and responsibilities provided
71 Hypatia insiders, [[outsiders lack both the entitlements provided
group members and the obligations attached to
belonging.]{.underline}]{.mark} Similar to non-family members, non-U.S.
citizens are neither entitled to citizenship benefits nor responsible
for national duties. In the United States where race is constructed via
assumed blood ties, race influences the differential distribution of
citizenship rights and responsibilities. Taxation policies illustrate
how ideas about family and race reinforce differences in entitlements
and obligations. Despite the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision
outlawing racial segregation in public schools, large numbers of
[[African-American children remain warehoused in poorly funded,
deteriorating, racially segregated inner city schools. These children
are seen as lacking merit and therefore unworthy of public
support]{.underline}]{.mark}. Contrasting their lot with the often
lavish school facilities and services provided to children attending
overwhelmingly White suburban schools, especially in affluent districts,
reveals substantial racial differences. Even though many of these
suburban children lack merit, the location of their homes entitles them
to superior public services. It is important to remember that these
patterns of racial segregation and differential obligations and
entitlements experienced by all U.S. children are far from random.
Governmental policies helped create these patterns of racially
segregated spaces that reproduce social inequalities (Massey and Denton
1993; Oliver and Shapiro 1995). In a situation of naturalized hierarchy,
conceptualizing U.S. national identity as composed of racial groups that
collectively comprise a U.S. national family fosters differential
patterns of enforcement of the rights and obligations of citizenship.
Members of some racial families receive full benefits of membership
while others encounter inferior treatment. Gender hierarchies add
additional complexity. African-American women\'s experiences with
entitlement criteria for 1930s Social Security programs, for example,
illustrate how institutionalized racism and gender-specific ideology
public policies shaped national public policy. Race was a factor in
deciding which occupations would be covered by Social Security. Two
occupational categories were expressly excluded from coverage:
agricultural and domestic workers, the two categories that included most
African-American women. Also, by providing differential benefits to men
and women through worker\'s compensation (for which Black women did not
qualify) and mother\'s aid, from its inception, Social Security
encompassed ideas about gender. Eligibility rules rewarded women who
remained in marriages and were supported by their husbands but penalized
women who became separated or divorced or who remained single and earned
their own way. Black women who were not in stable marriages lacked
access to spousal and widows benefits that routinely subsidized White
women. In this case, the combination of race-targeted policies
concerning occupational category and gender-targeted policies concerning
applicants\' marital status worked to exclude Black women from benefits
(Gordon 1994). On paper, Black 72 Patricia Hill Collins women may have
been first-class U.S. citizens, but their experiences reveal their
second-class treatment. Naturalized hierarchies embedded in the
traditional family ideal articulate not only with hierarchies of race
and nation but also with hierarchies of economic or social class
(Collins 1998, chapter 6). The traditional family ideal may be more
heavily implicated in social class organization in the United States
than previously imagined. Using the individual as the unit of analysis,
social class analyses have traditionally examined men\'s incomes as
central to family organization. However, moving from individuals to
families as the basic unit of social class analysis, and from income to
wealth as a measure of class, illustrate yet another way that [[family
serves as a privileged exemplar for
intersectionality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Shifting to wealth as a measure
of social class status suggests that families serve as important social
units for wealth\'s intergenerational transmission. As Oliver and
Shapiro observe, \"private wealth thus captures inequality that is the
product of the past, often passed down from generation to generation\"
(Oliver and Shapiro 1995, 2). Focusing on wealth not only references
contemporary economic inequality but also incorporates the historical
origins and reproduction of class differences over time. Despite ideas
that social mobility is widespread, U.S. children routinely enjoy or
suffer the economic status of their parents. [[Families constitute
important sites for inheritance, not solely of cultural values, but of
property. Families use wealth to create opportunities, secure a desired
standard of living, and pass their social class status to their
children.]{.underline}]{.mark} In this process, the family home becomes
more than a private respite from the demands of the public sphere. When
\"family values\" and \"property values\" become intertwined, homes in
racially segregated neighborhoods become important investments. The
traditional family ideal shows the family not only occupying a home, but
owning it. Ensconced in tax policies that provide lucrative benefits for
homeowners, for many Americans, the single-family home as a tangible
symbol of wealth remains central to the American dream (Coontz 1992).
Wealth matters because, if one adheres to rules of marriage and
childbearing, it is directly transferable from generation to generation.
It would be a mistake to view the intergenerational transmission of
property as primarily a phenomenon affecting middle-class and affluent
families.

#### Maintaining families along the border is key to child health outcomes -- the aff directly trades off with the family as an important site of political contestation.

**NICHQ 19** the National Institute for Children's Health Quality is a
mission-driven nonprofit dedicated to driving dramatic and sustainable
improvements in the complex issues facing children\'s health. \["Keeping

"Every day, [children across the country suffer from adverse childhood
experiences that will change how their brain develops, shape their
futures and threaten their health,"]{.underline} says Coté. "[And many
of these experiences are preventable.]{.underline} That's the motivating
part. That's why I joined NICHQ---because NICHQ looks at children's
health in the context of their experiences and the environments they
need to thrive." \"And that's why I want to talk about the recent crisis
at the border. [This crisis changed the course of thousands of
children\'s lives, touched many of us, and brought us together as a
nation around a fundamental belief that unnecessary separation from
parents is incredibly injurious for children, regardless of place, time
or circumstance."]{.underline} To illustrate her point, Coté takes a
step back, to January 14, 2010, two days after one of the most
devastating earthquakes in decades struck the country of Haiti, killing
over 300,000 victims and leaving millions more homeless. On that day,
Coté got off a plane in the Dominican Republic and traveled to
devastated Haiti, joining countless other aid workers trying to support
the desolated population. "It was absolute chaos," says Coté. "So much
destruction. I arrived at a rehabilitation camp as part of the
organizing team and I looked around as busloads of the injured arrived
and makeshift clinical shelters started taking shape. I asked myself a
question I'd learned to trust in chaotic situations in the operating
room: '[what is the most important thing to do right now?' I had to
identify what action I could take at that moment that would minimize
future harm and set us up for success down the]{.underline} line.'' For
Coté, that change focused on the Haitian children. After the earthquake,
victims were sent to triage centers and then rehabilitation centers that
corresponded with their needs. And in this impossibly hectic process,
**[children were getting separated from their families, often undergoing
traumatic treatments, even amputations, on their own. As a result, their
health was deteriorating]{.underline}**. This unintended consequence of
the care system, [separating children from their primary caregivers, was
making them vulnerable to even more atrocious harms---permanent family
loss and abduction.]{.underline} Coté, fellow aid workers and other
partners took action, developing a mobile records system to track and
manage family care. [In addition to treating the individual injury in
front of them, they included the family in care, comfort and
decisions.]{.underline} It was a small change but a significant one. The
UN and UNICEF child protection agencies came on board. Because of that
systems change---instituting a record system---[more children received
treatment alongside their families, the people most invested in their
health.]{.underline} "[Children's survival and well-being is incredibly
dependent on others because they are uniquely vulnerable to stressors in
their environmen]{.underline}t," says Coté. ["But they\'re also born
with the most powerful protective factor: their parents. **Taking a long
step back from any human turmoil---war, natural disaster, political
change, social unrest, disease---shows that keeping children with their
caregivers whenever possible is critical for both their immediate
survival and long-term health.**]{.underline} Keeping them together is
the most basic step for doing no harm, the first pledge we make as
health caregivers." Remembering this principle is how Coté and her team
improved the systems in Haiti. And it's the same principle that grounds
NICHQ's work optimizing children's health. Coté's story is an invitation
for others to pause, take a step back, and ask the same question she
asked in Haiti about children's health in the United States: What is the
most important thing we can do right now? [Right now, there are
thousands of children who were separated from their families at the
border. And in the U.S., millions of children live in poverty and remain
uninsured.]{.underline} These seemingly disparate realities are
intertwined, says Coté, because [the outcomes for the children affected
by each would be improved by solutions that acknowledge the power of
family-based supports.]{.underline} Solutions that recognize children's
inherent vulnerability and the caregiver's critical role in protecting
and providing for them. We see this in our improvement work every day.
[As infants, children gain critical health benefits from continuous
skin-to-skin contact with their mothers]{.underline}. During early
childhood, [when children's brains are developing at their most rapid
rate, caregivers are children's number one advocate, their first line of
developmental support and their biggest defender against adverse
experiences]{.underline}. Because of these and many other instances,
**[children's health cannot be isolated from their families' health and
wellbeing.]{.underline}** "That's what happened in Haiti eight years
ago," Coté continues. "It's what happened on our border in Texas. And
it's a central element to NICHQ's approach to systems improvement: [we
strive to support the health of families, the health of the
caregiver-child dyad, because we know their health is inextricably
connected]{.underline}. Supporting family health holistically proves
time and time again to be the best thing for children for their short
and long-term health outcomes." Coté, who has seen the lasting effects
of parent-child separation on the Micmac tribe in rural Maine, knows
this firsthand. In the late 19th and 20th century, [the children of the
Micmac tribe, along with other indigenous groups across the country,
were systematically separated from their parents and sent away to
schools, purportedly for assimilation purposes.]{.underline} Generations
later, Coté witnessed the physical and psychological devastation that
lived on in the families she served. **[The violence of the past invaded
the families' present, through cycles of domestic violence, poverty,
untreated mental illness and substance abuse. "What we do right now will
affect generations to come,"]{.underline}** says Coté. "**[It's why we
always need to look at the child's health in the context of their
family's health]{.underline}**. For our borders, that means continuing
to support actions that keep children with their caregivers because,
[without their first protective factor, children's health is at
incredible risk.]{.underline} For our health systems, that means
continuing to carry that same principle of family centered-support into
all aspects of our work---from helping healthy mothers breastfeed their
babies to giving families the tools to support their child's
developmental health." [If we do this, if we keep families together, we
give kids their best chance for a healthy future]{.underline}. And by
focusing our efforts on supporting families, we will improve children's
outcomes in communities across our nation.

family]{.underline}** and matriarch, yet do so **[in a way that
interrogates]{.underline}** the very **[violence required to ensure
family life.]{.underline}** Neither Lindsey nor Spillers offer reformed
versions---matriarchal or queer---of the family as viable options for
Black sociality. Due to Lindsey's **[[refusal to
redeem]{.underline}]{.mark}**---she **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
fact **[[intent on destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[the
institution of the family for Black social life]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and Spillers' indifference to the category as a viable or meaningful way
of signifying Black life within the symbolic economy of slavery, I argue
that **[Lindsey and Spillers enable a horizon where even the family is
beyond redemption within an antiblack world.]{.underline}** While
Lindsey calls for a destruction of the institution of the family and
Spillers questions this viability of the violent formation for Black
life; I contend that both **[Lindsey and Spillers]{.underline}** utter
(and **[make conceivable]{.underline}**) the possibility of the
abolition of the family and its attendant violence in the wake of
slavery's and The Moynihan Report's modes of surveillance.15 More
importantly, **[[Lindsey's and Spiller's
abolitionist]{.underline}]{.mark}** position aligns and **[[conspires
with]{.mark} the]{.underline}** various **[[anti-geneological fugitive
formations that]{.underline}]{.mark}** Saidiya
**[[Hartman's]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2007) **[[motherless and stateless
tribes take up]{.mark} during slavery and its afterlife.]{.underline}**
Lindsey's charge to destroy the institution of the family and Spillers'
profound sense of doubt in the promise of the family contribute to a
generative form a pessimism that forces one to seek out the elswhere of
something better. First, I examine the ways that **[[Lindsey
tethers]{.mark} the violence of [conquest, slavery
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[ongoing [surveillance of Black life to
the institution]{.mark}]{.underline}** and episteme of the family.
Secondly, **[I interpret Spillers as assuming]{.underline}** a position
of **[agnosticism about]{.underline}** the pot**[ential of scholarly
efforts to recuperate the 'slave family.']{.underline}** I also read
Spillers as **[gesturing toward a new or otherwise economy of naming
free]{.underline}** of the **[entanglements of the filial]{.underline}**
and the violence of the human in "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe." Further,
my own rereadings of the trope of the Black matriarch through these
Lindsean and Spillerian lenses compel me to consider the Black matriarch
anew. **[My first reading of the Black matriarch takes her up as an
unassimilable figure of destruction of the family and]{.underline}** the
**[nation]{.underline}** during the urban rebellions of the 1960s. **[My
second reading]{.underline}** of the matriarch **[configures her as a
subject bound to failure and beyond redemption]{.underline}** in the
novel Push. **[As I plumb]{.underline}** the Black matriarch's negative
or **[pessimistic aspects]{.underline}** in ways that foreclose her
reclamation, **[[I find a way forward]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a mode
of Black social life **[[through]{.mark} figuring
Precious]{.underline}**, the Black girl protagonist of Push, **[as one
of]{.underline}** Saidiya **[[Hartman's motherless slaves and fugitives
without genealogy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or biological family---
**[[who]{.mark} have to [recreate Black sociality on new
terms.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## NEG ANSWERS -- TVA 

#### The TVA is to ban all US FMS and DHS weapons. This supports an arms control regime and solves the entirety of the aff by holding the rich and powerful accountable for their participation in regional destabilization and global violence.

**Dalby 11** \[Simon Dalby, "Critical Geopolitics and the Control of
Arms in the 21^st^ Century," *Contemporary Security Policy,* 32:1, 24
May 2011 //tjb\]

Implicitly this point also challenges the geopolitical assumption of
state rivalry as the most important matter to be dealt with by global
politics. **[Here, arms control regimes actually may have their most
important contribution to make.]{.underline}** Who are any of these arms
control regimes actually for? **[The assumption that they only work when
the rich and powerful actually want them to misses the point that the
more general shift to illegality of many weapons is precisely the
political effect of moral sanction; calling weapons illegal may make
states pause, and when equipping forces, pay some attention to
international opinion.]{.underline}** **[In a crunch, if a state thinks
that its survival is at stake this may not matter much, but insofar as
it acts to prevent the preparation of such weapons in the first place it
may actually be quite useful.]{.underline}**38 **[Above all the purpose
of norms and international agreements remains to a substantial extent a
matter of the politics of shaming the rich and powerful into acting more
reasonably, and here arms controls matter in terms of providing norms to
which state elites can be held at least partly
accountable.]{.underline}** This too is, of course, subject to political
struggle, as David Capie suggests in the case of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), where norms concerning small arms
proliferation were reframed to make them consistent with the larger
policies of non-interference in internal affairs that is key to the
ASEAN arrangement.39

## BLACKNESS AS A WEAPON

#### The Black body lives to die, and its specter structures the White symbolic and the nation state. Black death serves as the matrix and grammar of possibility that whiteness uses to articulate its futurity. This futurity entails the destruction of immigrant communities, native land, natural resources, and privatizations of non-white forms of life. But what would occur if Black death were to strike back? In the face of state violence and nuclear evisceration we must terrorize the White symbolic and wage death as a weapon.

**Gillspie 17** (John, "On the Prospect of Weaponized Death". Propter
Nos, Volume 2: Issue 1. PhD student at UC Irvine, Comparative
Literature. //lilith)

[If we are engaging in a war in which the symbolic value]{.underline},
the semiotics of this World itself, [positions "the Black as death
personified, the White as personification of diversity, of life
itself,"18 then resistance needs an "unspoken dynamic." It needs a space
where "words don't go"---a form of guerrilla linguistics, a submarined
syntax, an undercommon communication.]{.underline} [Perhaps,
here]{.underline}, where the conversation is blackened, and the theory
is phobogenic, and the journal is Propter Nos, [we can allow ourselves
to excavate insurgent dictions still lost in the lingua franca of White
Being, but full of the specter of black terror, black disorientation.
**If the Black is death personified, then what might happen if we
weaponized our death? What might happen if we recognized the
inevitability of that death? What if we began to think that the
non-uniqueness of that death was an opening towards the "end of
Humanity?"**]{.underline} In The Spirit of Terrorism, Jean Baudrillard
writes, ["When global power monopolizes the situation to this extent,
when there is such a formidable condensation of all functions in the
technocratic machinery, and when no alternative form of thinking is
allowed, what other way is there but a terroristic situational
transfer?"]{.underline}19 [Terrorism consists of the militaristic
tactics used by those who are facing globalized White Being with
asymmetrical technologies of terror, violence, intimidation and war. A
terrorist is any armed vigilante willing to rupture the system of
semiotics through an equally cofounding semiotic.]{.underline} A
semiotic that returns one to the "desert of the \[Black\] Real"---where
[a "project of total disorder"]{.underline} is unleashed upon the
semiotic system.20 [Black terrorism is a violence that re-appropriates
the death embedded in the Black's ontological incapacity in order to
enable the possibility of a radical capacity---gratuitous
freedom]{.underline}. White Being itself is a decentralized
ontoepistemic deployment of violence, and [if violent insurgency is
necessary, then the decentralized approach of the black terrorist is
necessary to counter the terror of White Being]{.underline}. This being
said, black terrorism is perhaps better understood as counter-terror
terrorism. **[We do not have the power to end the World with life. We
only have the power to end the World through death]{.underline}**. As
Baudrillard writes, "The radical difference is that [the terrorist,
while they have at their disposal weapons that are the system's own,
possess a further lethal weapon: their own deaths]{.underline}."21 [The
United States has an international military force, a storehouse of
nuclear arms, and the capacity, within their police state alone, to
"terrorize" not just one block in Baltimore, but the whole entire world.
Black terrorism is what happens when we heed the Afro-Pessimist call
that "A living death is as much a death as it is a
living]{.underline},"22 it is what happens when we take seriously the
unsayable in Afro-Pessimism. [Black Terrorism is (non)ontological
fugitivity that disavows any need to focus on social life---black
terrorism steals black death itself from White Being]{.underline}. It is
for this reason that Baudrillard speaks to his own White Being and the
specter of terror when he says: [When Western culture sees all of its
values extinguished one by one, it turns inward on itself in the very
worst way.]{.underline} Our death is an extinction, an annihilation.
Herein lies our poverty. [When a singularity throws its own death into
the ring, it escapes this slow extermination, its dies its own natural
death.]{.underline} This is an immense game of double or quits. [In
committing suicide, the singularity suicides the other at the same
time--- we might say that the terrorist acts literally 'suicided' the
West]{.underline}. A death for a death, then, but transfigured by the
symbolic stakes. 'We have already devastated our world, what more do you
want?' says Muray. But precisely, [we have devastated this world, it
still has to be destroyed. Destroyed symbolically]{.underline}. This is
not at all the same undertaking. And though we did the first part, only
others are going to be able to do the second.23 We are the others.
[Tasked with the (un)fortunate task of ending White hyper-realism, the
White World, and White Being. Well aware that if White Fascism continues
the project of black annihilation, the only choice we will have is to
fight.]{.underline} Not because we want to, but because we have to. But,
ultimately, we must remember the words of Huey Newton: ["\[T\]he first
lesson a revolutionary must learn is that he is a doomed
man]{.underline}."24 In the age of Trump, [the perfection of slavery
reaches its horizon]{.underline}.25 [The disavowal of the lives of
refugees is White Being attempting to reconcile the "Nation State"
simulation with the free track and flow of bodies it's been attempting
to murder; the deportation of undocumented immigrants in conjunction
with the materialization of borders is White Being attempting to secure
its linguistic and economic integrity; the rise of the private prison
and the militarization of the police force is White Being attempting to
innovate the system of enslavement and necropolitics for the 21st
Century; the plundering of indigenous land and bodies is White Being
attempting to finish off the project of genocide; the disregard for the
Earth is White Being ensuring the Anthropocene will also be the
Apocalypse]{.underline}. [Trump is a reinvigoration, a call to arms, for
White Being, and White Being can only be "destroyed
symbolically]{.underline}." Black terrorism transfigures the symbolic
stakes because it steals away that condition of White Being's
possibility in a kind of fugitivity that is a zero-transformation into
Blackness. This being said, we all know that the only thing that follows
the absolute loss of hope is this Black Spring, this Neo-Fanonian
violence, this blackened terroristic situational transfer. In
Baudrillard's words, in the Age of Trump, let us remember the gift of
immorality, "[Terrorism is immoral]{.underline}. The World Trade Center
event, that symbolic challenge, is immoral, and it is a response to a
globalization which is itself immoral. [So, let us be
immoral]{.underline}..."26

#### Blackness is already weaponized because of the afterlife of slavery -- this weaponization is precisely what calls violence into being against Black people.

[[Living in/the wake of slavery is living "the afterlife of
property"]{.mark} and living the afterlife of partus sequitur ventrem
([that which is brought forth follows the womb),]{.mark}]{.underline} in
which [[the Black child inherits the non/ status, the non/being of the
mother]{.mark}. That inheritance of a non/status is [everywhere apparent
now in the ongoing criminalization of Black women and children.]{.mark}
[Living]{.mark} [in the wake on a global level means]{.mark} [living the
disastrous time and effects of continued marked migrations]{.mark},
[Mediterranean and Caribbean]{.mark} [disasters, trans-American and
-African migration, structural adjustment imposed by the International
Monetary Fund that continues imperialisms/colonialisms, and
more.]{.mark}]{.underline} And here, in the United States, it means
living and dying through the policies of the first US Black president;
it means the gratuitous violence of stopand-frisk and Operation Clean
Halls; rates of Black incarceration that boggle the mind (Black people
represent 60 percent of the imprisoned population); the immanence of
death as "a predictable and constitutive aspect of this democracy"
(James and Costa Vargas 2012, 193, emphasis mine). [L[iving in the wake
means living]{.mark} the history and present of [terror, from slavery to
the present, as the ground of]{.mark} our [everyday Black
existence]{.mark}; living [the historically and geographically
dis/continuous but always present and endlessly reinvigorated brutality
in, and on, our bodies while even as that terror is visited on our
bodies the realities of that terror are erased.]{.mark} Put another way,
[living in the wake means living in and with terror in that in much of
what passes for public discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} about terror we,
[[Black people, become the carriers of terror]{.mark}, terror's
embodiment, [and not the primary objects of terror's multiple
enactments; the ground of terror's possibility
globall]{.mark}y[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This is]{.mark} everywhere
[clear]{.mark} [as we think about]{.mark} those [Black people in the
United States who can "weaponize sidewalks" (Trayvon Martin)]{.mark} and
s[hoot themselves while handcuffed (Victor White III, Chavis Carter,
Jesus Huerta, and more)]{.mark}, [those Black people
transmigrating]{.mark}]{.underline}[21]{.mark} [the African continent
toward the Mediterranean and then to Europe [who are imagined as
insects, swarms, vectors of disease; familiar narratives of danger and
disaster]{.mark} that [attach to our always already weaponized Black
bodies (the weapon is blackness).]{.mark}]{.underline} We must also, for
example, think of President Obama's former press secretary Robert Gibbs,
who said, commenting on the drone murder of sixteen-year-old US citizen
Abdulrahman AlAlwaki, "I would suggest that you should have a far more
responsible father if you are truly concerned about the well being
\[sic\] of your children" (Grim 2012).22 We must consider this alongside
the tracking of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent without
papers by drones in the midst of the ongoing ethnic cleansing in the
Dominican Republic.23 [We must [consider Gibbs's statement alongside
Barack Obama's reprimands of Black men in the United States, his
admonishing them to be responsible fathers.]{.mark} Consider, too, [the
resurgence of narratives that Black people were better off in chattel
slavery.]{.mark} [This is Black life in the wake; this is the flesh,
these are bodies, to which anything and everything can be and is
done.]{.mark} In the immediate aftermath of the [June 17, 2015, murders
of six Black women and three Black men in the Emanuel African Methodist
Episcopal (ame) Church in South Carolina i]{.mark}n the United States,
the poet [Claudia Rankine published a New York Times op-ed piece titled
"The Condition of Black Life Is One of Mourning."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Rankine writes, ["Though [the white liberal imagination likes to feel
temporarily bad about black suffering]{.mark}, [there really is no mode
of empathy that can replicate the daily strain of knowing that as a
black person you can be killed for simply being black: no hands in your
pockets, no playing music, no sudden movements, no driving your car, no
walking at night, no walking in the day, no turning onto this street, no
entering this building, no standing your ground, no standing here, no
standing there, no talking back, no playing with toy guns, no living
while black"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rankine 2015). To be in the wake is
to live in those no's, to live in the no-space that the law is not bound
to respect, to live in no citizenship, to live in the long time of Dred
and Harriet Scott; and it is more than that. To be/in the wake is to
occupy that time/space/place/construction (being in the wake) in all of
the meanings I referenced. To be in the wake is to recognize the
categories I theorize in this text as the ongoing locations of Black
being: the wake, the ship, the hold, and the weather. To be in the wake
is also to recognize the ways that we are constituted through and by
continued vulnerability to overwhelming force though not only known to
ourselves and to each other by that force.24 The Wake 17 In the midst of
so much death and the fact of Black life as proximate to death, how do
we attend to physical, social, and figurative death and also to the
largeness that is Black life, Black life insisted from death? I want to
suggest that that might look something like wake work.

## THE US IS WAR

#### America is in a state of war -- violence [exported globally]{.underline} through the American war machine is an extension of the war that we've [always]{.underline} been in the midst of: the war against [insurgent black social life]{.underline}. Darren Wilson, Justin Volpe, and Stacey Koon are the same [state sanctioned drones]{.underline} deployed during the War on Terror and surveillance mechanisms are the [same guns]{.underline} exported to black communities.

**Moten 15**. Fred Moten is an American poet and scholar whose work
explores critical theory, black studies, and performance studies. Moten
is professor of performance studies at New York University and has
taught previously at University of California, Riverside \["Do Black
Lives Matter?: Robin D.G. Kelley and Fred Moten in Conversation," 2015,
URL: <https://vimeo.com/116111740>, Modified\]//vikas

I'm just gonna start off very briefly. First of all, what Robin Kelley
in that piece that Rachel just quoted from seems to be absolutely true,
so true, and sometimes so obscure it needs to be repeated again and
again. Which is that **[we're in a state of war]{.underline}**. You
know, **[[George W. Bush declared a War on Terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and **[[that War on Terror]{.mark} quickly [came to be]{.mark}
understood as [a permanent war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** War on Terror that was a **[[permanent
war was an extension of the war we've always been
in.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And I think that in fact **[[insurgent social
life]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[black social life]{.underline}** --
**[[has always been as terrible]{.mark} to]{.underline}** the likes of
George W. **[Bush [as anything that]{.mark}]{.underline}** Osama **[[Bin
Laden]{.mark} ever [did or thought]{.mark} about]{.underline}** doing.
It's important to understand that the **[[drones are sent into]{.mark}
our [communities]{.mark} that go by]{.underline}** the name of **[Darren
Wilson]{.underline}**, or ... **[Justin Volpe]{.underline}**, **[or
Stacey Koon.]{.underline}** **[[They represent]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
long standing tradition of **[[brutal and violent technological
innovation]{.mark} visited upon us in]{.underline}** the most
**[horrific ways]{.underline}**. And I think it's important to
understand that this state of war has existed -- and that in a weird way
-- the **[[drones]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[are sent into our
community]{.mark} imagine themselves to be
self-defensive]{.underline}**. **[[Settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
always **[[think they're defending themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
That's why **[they built forts on other peoples' land]{.underline}**.
And they freak out over the fact that they're surrounded. And they're
still surrounded. It's important to understand **[this doesn't
constitute justification for the violence they commit]{.underline}**.
But it's an important thing for us to remember because it gives us some
indication of the forces that we actually represent. And we need to know
something about who we are and what we are. And with that in mind I
think **[[it's]{.mark} really [important to understand]{.mark} not only
these]{.underline}** sort of **[[intense]{.mark}
continuous]{.underline}**, **[which is]{.underline}** what we've seen in
the last few weeks and months is **[an [extension of]{.mark} what Wells
called [lynch law.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When I was in college, I had
these friends and we were naïve enough to think that -- and I don't even
know if it was that, I don't know if we were naïve -- but we certainly
believed that: that some historical force has sent us to Harvard to plot
revolution. And we would walk around -- you know -- with that in mind.
And I remember we used to talk about the fact that during ... the period
immediately after Reconstruction **[[from 1880 to
1920]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[someone black was lynched]{.mark} at
a rate of [one in every 48 hours]{.mark} in a 40 year
period]{.underline}**. And **[we used to recite that statistic all the
time]{.underline}**. And I think **[what was native]{.underline}** about
what we were doing **[was that [we]{.mark}]{.underline}** had
**[[thought that]{.mark} that [statistic had]{.mark}]{.underline}**
waned or that it had somehow been **[[eclipsed]{.mark} after
1920]{.underline}**. And I think the rate has probably increased since
then. **[Which is once against indicative of the fact that [we are at a
state of war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But it's not enough to say that or
understand that because we need to understand what it actually is that
the state is defending itself from. And I think in this respect, the
particular instances of Michael Brown's murder and Eric Garner's murder
are worth paying attention to. Because, **[what [the drone]{.mark}
Darren [Wilson shot into was insurgent black life]{.mark} walking down
the street]{.underline}**. I don't think he meant to violate the
individual personhood of Michael Brown. He was shooting at mobile black
sociality walking down the street that he understood implicitly
constituted a threat to the order he swore to protect. **[Eric
Garner]{.underline}**, on an everyday basis, **[initiated a new
alternative kind of marketplace]{.underline}**. **[[Another mode of
social life]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[That's what they
killed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Okay? So when we say black lives matter,
what we obscure sometimes is the fact that it is black life that
matters. That **[insurgent [black social life]{.mark} still [constitutes
a profound threat to the order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[a reason
it constitutes such a threat is because of its openness]{.underline}**.
**[[It's unfixity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The fact that anyone can claim
it and the fact that it can claim anybody. It seems to me that -- and
I'll close with this -- I was thinking of a couple things on the plane
coming up here today. Clearly, you know, both in the instance of Michael
Brown and of Eric Garner. **[These are manifestations of broken windows
policing]{.underline}**. And what they made clear is that **[we are the
broken windows]{.underline}**. **[We constitute this threat to an
already existing normative order]{.underline}**. And I think that the
police have this regulatory function that is designed to destroy broken
windows. Even in a weird way to fix them by destroying them. I study
literature or philosophy. And I guess about **[10 or 12 years
ago]{.underline}**, **[I became obsessed with this passage in a book
that sorted the culmination of]{.underline}** the philosophical work of
a figure who most folks claim to be the most important modern
philosopher in the Western tradition: Emmanuel **[Kant]{.underline}**.
And the book is called critique of judgement. And in that book, **[Kant
writes the imagination in its lawless freedom produces nothing but
nonsense]{.underline}**. It must have its wings severally clipped by the
understanding. **[[He opposes]{.mark} the [lawlessness
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[imagination with]{.mark} the
[regulatory police function of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And there's a whole
complicated, but not very surprising, way in which imagination is both
racialized and gendered and sexualized and all these profound ways
throughout the Western philosophical tradition. Kant's interesting
because he understands that you can't do without imagination. **[But
[he]{.mark} definitely [wants its wings clipped]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[He demands its be regulated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the history
of English poetry, the window has often been conceived of as a figure
for imagination, as a kind of lens through which we see and through
which we envision. **[And part of [what's at stake is]{.mark} that I
think is]{.underline}** that **[to fix [a broken window is to fix
another way of imaging the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It's [to
literally fix it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[To destroy
it]{.underline}**. **[To regulate it]{.underline}**. **[To exclude to
it]{.underline}**. [**[To incarcerate it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} But
also, also at the same time, to incorporate it, to capitalize on it, to
exploit it, to accumulate it. **[This state can't live with us and they
can't live without us.]{.underline}** It's not so much about...it's
important to recognize that **[the broken window]{.underline}** -- the
alternative unfixed window through which we see the world -- **[is not
just the way in which we see something that doesn't
exist]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** it's also the way in which
**[we see and imagine that which does exist]{.underline}**. It's
important to imagine how things might be otherwise, but it's also
important to really, really see who and what we are right now. Because,
I think they see who and what we are right now. **[[They see who and
what we are through]{.mark} the sights of their
[guns]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Through]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[surveillance mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Sometimes we know
more about what we are and what we can do than we do. Emancipation
produced two problems, or kind of extended a problem: the enslaved
persons were protected property and at the same time they constituted a
threat in their conscious activity, every minute of the day to the very
idea of property. So that **[in the aftermath of
emancipation]{.underline}** when that property was no longer protected,
**[a new set of innovation and regulation had to emerge under the rubric
of policing]{.underline}**. **[That's lynch law.]{.underline}** Broken
windows are an extension of that. So, I think
**[[it's]{.underline}]{.mark}** really **[[important to
understand]{.mark} just [enough about what they do]{.mark} so that it
can give us]{.underline}** a little more **[clear understanding
of]{.underline}** what we do and what we are. How we need to act. How we
need to behave. Not in response to them, but in **[[the deepest and most
radical extension of]{.mark} the [historical tendency of black social
life to]{.mark}]{.underline}** constantly both **[[imagine and enact
another way of living]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Earth. So I'm very happy
to be here to talk with you about a little bit about that.

## MILITARIZATION OF POLICE AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE

#### The Ops are the frontline defenders of racial capitalism that perceives blackness as a threat that needs constant repression. From the War on Drugs to the shooting of Michael Brown, liberal governance has sought out the militarization of the police as the newest form of lynching. Our response can't be some pitiful protest or call for reform, but a militant struggle aiming for complete emancipation

[The image on the cover of Time magazine of a single protester---on her

times, with the final fatal bullet entering the top of his head,
suggesting he was going down or on his knees. The gesture of surrender,
then, failed to do its work, exacerbating the outrage at the killing of
an unarmed black teenager by making it seem even more vicious and
gratuitous.]{.underline} But [the summary execution of a black man by
the police is a common occurrence in America. The cops routinely suffer
no consequences]{.underline} or else get a slap on the wrist. Yet
opinion about Brown's death is widely divergent. Although blacks and
anti-racist whites see the killing as an outrage, more money has been
raised in support of the killer police officer, Darren Wilson, than for
the family of Michael Brown. There are those who describe the black
protesters as "troublemakers"---meaning those who fight back against the
police by throwing rocks or bottles, engage in looting, or simply voice
their outrage by protesting peacefully, by protesting at all, even with
their hands raised in surrender. For the racist whites who support the
police, protesters and looters are all the same. For those who support
the protesters, looting is a diversion from the main story of racist
murder. Even news crews, reporters and bystanders in Ferguson, regarded
as sympathetic to the protesters, have been attacked or arrested by the
police. Black protest, it would seem, is regarded by many not as a
constitutional right in a democracy but as a form of "violence," a
public assertion of rights that cannot or should not be tolerated. [If
the shooting of Michael Brown is considered by many to be
justified]{.underline}, and protest, no matter how supplicating, is
regarded as infuriating and intolerable, [then [we must see]{.mark} such
[cop killings]{.mark}]{.underline} of unarmed black men [[as a form of
modern legalized lynching.]{.underline}]{.mark} [At the height
of]{.underline} private and spectacle [lynchings]{.underline} from the
1890s to the 1930s[, if black people were not sufficiently deferential
and submissive, then they were considered "uppity," which could be
grounds for lethal action. Not much has changed in decades since
then]{.underline} for cops and racist whites. A Huffington Post/YouGov
poll finds that 76 percent of black respondents say the shooting is part
of a broader pattern in the way police treat black men, nearly double
the number of whites who agree (40
percent).[2](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f2) Similarly, a Pew
Research Center poll finds that 80 percent of blacks favor the statement
that Brown's shooting "raises important issues about race that need to
be discussed" while only 18 percent of whites favor this statement over
another that says "the issue of race is getting more attention than it
deserves."[3](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f3) While the
performance of non-resistance expressed by the "hands up, don't shoot"
gesture of defenseless surrender is meant to advance black interests by
exposing the violation of basic civil rights and due process, it also is
meant to pressure and shame the racist establishment into effective
reform. But for the racists in charge, the cops are just "doing their
job" when they humiliate, brutalize, and kill black people on the
street. [[The cops have always been the front-line defenders of a racist
capitalist system that is built on the repression of poor, black, Latino
and working people in the service of a tiny wealthy elite]{.mark}, the
ones to whom the cops are accountable. As if demonstrating their power
to kill with impunity, despite this recent round of protests, two days
later in Los Angeles cops killed Ezell Ford, another unarmed black man;
eight days later and less than four miles away from where Brown was
killed, police in St. Louis shot to death Kajieme Powell, an agitated
black man on the street holding a knife. The submissive hands up gesture
of black protesters facing a militarized police force is meant to appeal
to liberal sympathies by showing that they are "respectful" and
law-abiding, suggesting the opposite of "uppity." Yet the deference of
the act has the paradoxical effect of reinforcing white stereotypes
about black people]{.underline}. As Martin Berger demonstrates in his
revisionist study of iconic civil rights photos, Seeing through Race,
[white-run newspapers selected civil rights photos showing black
passivity in the face of police violence while black-run newspapers
selected photos that showed both protesters and police as active
agents.]{.underline} Berger suggests that images of blacks offering no
resistance to police violence were selected by white editors because it
was easier to gain white liberal sympathy by visually defining racism as
excessive acts of brutality, from which moderate and liberal whites
could distance themselves, while at the same time their racial anxiety
could be quelled by the picturing of black non-resistance, which meant
that whites were still in
charge.[4](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f4) Black editors, on the
other hand, often preferred to show black agency. Similar juxtapositions
are established by the visual record of Ferguson. [[The
hyper-militarized police deploy tanks and automatic assault rifles,
flash bombs, tear gas and rubber bullets, weapons that recall the water
cannons and dogs of the civil rights era.]{.mark} Both then and now,
[photos of]{.mark} the [militarized police facing black protesters who
are non-resistant perform reassuring symbolic work that manages white
anxieties about race. Whites are still in control and racism is
understood as brutal acts of violence, not as part of the insidious
indignities and brutalization of everyday life.]{.mark} Picturing blacks
as non-threatening and non-resistant effectively places them in a role
of limited power; it does not fundamentally threaten white racial
power.]{.underline} As Berger observes of civil rights photos, "The
photographs presented story lines that allowed magnanimous and
sympathetic whites to imagine themselves bestowing rights on blacks,
given that the dignified and suffering blacks of the photographic record
appeared in no position to take anything from white
America."[5](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f5) [Whether
progressive or reactionary, [whites]{.mark}, not blacks, [are
constructed as the agents of change while normalizing black passivity
and]{.mark} even subtly promoting [ongoing black humiliation.]{.mark} It
must be understood that equating racism only with acts of police
brutality obscures the values of whiteness that are foundational to the
racial hierarchy and that repress black
agency.]{.underline}[6](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f6)
[Demonstrating their control of the black body even after death, the
police left Michael Brown's body in the street for more than four hours,
lying face down with blood streaming from his head in broad daylight in
the summer sun.]{.underline} Although officers quickly secured the area
with yellow tape, they stood at a distance while horrified neighbors
called news stations, shielded their children and took shaky cellphone
videos that have found their way into the national media. Although
Brown's body was covered after a brief period with a sheet by a passing
paramedic, his feet were left exposed and his blood was visible. More
cops were called to the scene as the tension levels mounted among
shocked residents. [The Ferguson police defended the long delay by
asserting that "the time that elapsed in getting detectives to the scene
was not out of the ordinary, and that conditions made it unusually
difficult to do all that they
needed]{.underline}."[7](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f7) The
former New York City chief medical examiner, Dr. Michael M. Baden, who
was hired by the Brown family's lawyers to do an autopsy, observed that
there was "no forensic reason" for leaving the body in view for so
long.[8](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f8) At best, [allowing
Brown's body to remain in public view in the presence of distressed
family members suggests gross incompetence and insensitivity. At worst,
it continues the legacy of American lynching in which white supremacists
left murdered black bodies exposed as warnings to members of the black
community to "stay in their place."]{.underline} Images of non-resistant
protesters are not the only photos available, however[. Another iconic
image taken in Ferguson is that of a young black man wearing an American
flag t-shirt and hurling a tear-gas canister back at the police with one
hand while casually holding a bag of potato chips in the
other]{.underline} ([Figure
3](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#fig03)). [This is an act of
self-defense against the perpetrators of violence. For blacks,
confronting the police and throwing back a tear gas canister that had
been flung at them became a badge of
honor.]{.underline}[9](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f9) For
racist whites who are predisposed to see images of blacks as active
agents in their own defense as a form of "violence," such an image may
validate what they believe about the proper hierarchy of racial power.
[The real fear of seeing blacks as more than passive and non-resistant,
that is, as active agents in defense of their rights, is the specter it
raises of more organized social and political struggle, in concert with
allied whites, against the racist capitalist system of injustice that
allows the criminalization of blackness and the wanton killing of black
people. [The police have become]{.mark} so [militarized]{.mark} in great
part [as a response to the threat of social struggle. Military grade
hardware found its way into the hands of local police forces]{.mark}
around the country [long before]{.mark} the attacks [of
9/11]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1990, [[the National Defense Authorization
Act empowered the Pentagon to transfer to federal and state agencies
Department of Defense equipment "suitable for use]{.mark} by such
agencies [in counter-drug
activities."]{.mark}]{.underline}[[10](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f10)
[Thus the "war on drugs," which targeted black men]{.mark}
disproportionately[,]{.mark} greatly [furthered the militarization
of]{.mark} the [police and stockpiling of hardware]{.mark} that we see
[in towns and cities such as Ferguson]{.mark} today. [SWAT teams, in
which helmeted and masked police enter homes with guns drawn, knocking
down the door with a battering ram and rushing inside,]{.mark} were
originally formed to deal with "civil unrest" as well as
life-threatening situations. Today they [are routinely deployed to serve
drug-related warrants in private
homes.]{.mark}]{.underline}[[11](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f11)
As economic inequality continues to grow exponentially, the state
invests in ever more security, surveillance and weaponry.]{.underline}
Far more money is spent on policing and government efforts to counteract
protest movements than on rebuilding our declining cities by creating
jobs, renewing infrastructure, providing adequate housing, city
services, or access to health care and education. While it is more
difficult to photograph the complex social dynamics of poverty and
economic decline in hundreds of cities across the nation and the
criminalization of black people, another Ferguson image alludes to the
larger racial dynamic in America[. A young black protester holds a sign
written on cardboard that says, "My blackness is not a
weapon"]{.underline} [This assertion recognizes that in a country where
racial equality has yet to be achieved, blackness itself is regarded as
a threat, especially if you are young and male. As conservative pundit
Ben Stein openly said of Michael Brown on Newsmax, "He wasn\'t unarmed.
He was armed with his incredibly strong, scary
self."]{.underline}[[12](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/559367#f12)
[Blackness itself evokes white racial anxiety and the need to contain
and control that anxiety through racist repression.]{.mark} Such
repression can only be countered by organized social struggle with clear
emancipatory goals. [Moral appeals through passive non-resistance, or
other symbolic gestures]{.mark}, while courageous and useful in raising
the visibility of injustice, [will not be enough.]{.mark}]{.underline}
