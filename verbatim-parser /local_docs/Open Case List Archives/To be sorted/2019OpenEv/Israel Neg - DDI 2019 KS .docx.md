#### Israel is in the top 10 arms exporters in the world -- can produce own weapons

**[Haas 18]{.underline}** Saar Haas, 3-17-2018, \"Israel is 7th largest
arms exporter in the world,\" Ynetnews citing SIPRI,

**[Israel is the 7th largest exporter of weapons in the world, according
to the SIPRI report. Over the past five years, the export of Israeli
weapons systems climbed by 55 percent compared to the five years that
preceded it, which is the biggest increase among the top 10 arms
exporters.]{.underline}** Almost half (49%) of Israeli weapons exported
from 2013 to 2017 went to India, 13% to Azerbaijan and 6.3% to Vietnam.
Over the past year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Israel,
while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently made a reciprocal visit
to India. During both visits, the two nations put an emphasis on massive
sales of arms from Israel to India, including Barak aerial defense
missiles, IAI Eitan (Heron TP) drones, airborne targeting and navigation
pods, and several deals-in-the-making for IAI EL/M-2075 Phalcon, an
early warning systems for aircraft, and Spike anti-tank missiles. Indian
imports from Israel increased by 285% over the past five years, compared
to 2008-2012, the report found. [**According to the SIPRI report, Israel
provided India and Azerbaijan with, inter alia, loitering munitions
(known as a suicide drone).** There have been reports the Israeli IAI
Harop drone, which is said to be a suicide drone, was seen in battles
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Video footage published by the
Washington Post in 2016 purports to show an IAI Harop drone crashing
onto targets in Armenia.]{.underline} Israel\'s arms sale to Azerbaijan
also led to a scandal. Israeli company Aeronautics reportedly carried
out a \"live demonstration\" of an attack of one its suicide drones on a
military post in Armenia at the request of Azerbaijan\'s military. The
Israel Police\'s Lahav 433 unit, in conjunction with the Defense
Ministry, launched an investigation against the company \"about a deal
with a significant client.\" A gag order has been placed on all details
of the investigation and the names of the suspects. **[Israel is also
the third-largest arms provider for South Korea, Italy and
Britain.]{.underline}** In arms imports, Israel is 17th in the world,
according to the report. Israel has increased its import of arms by 125%
over the past five years. Sixty percent of this weapon came from the
United States, including 50 F-35 fighter jets, only nine of which has so
far been delivered. Germany was responsible for 30% of Israel\'s arms
imports, including two submarines, but excluding three additional
submarines that are at the center of a police corruption investigation.
Italy, which provides the Israeli Air Force with its training planes, is
responsible for 10% of Israel\'s arms imports. In total, there has been
a 10% increase in international arms sales, with 32% of the weapons
going to the Middle East. The arms import in the region has doubled over
the past five years, continuing a similar trend in the five years that
preceded it. The United States, Britain and France are the largest arms
suppliers to the Middle East, while Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United
Arab Emirates are the largest buyers. Britain, for example, sold almost
half of its exported weapons to Saudi Arabia.

#### UK will fill-in -- did so during Gaza protests -- will do so in any other situation

Akkad 6/24 (Dania, Staff Writer, "REVEALED: UK approved £14m in arms
sales to Israel during Gaza protests",
<https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/revealed-uk-approved-ps14mn-arm-sales-israel-during-gaza-protests>,
NR)

**[The British government licensed arms deals worth over
£14m]{.underline}** (\$17.8m) **[to Israel last year even as Israeli
soldiers]{.underline}** were accused of **[intentionally firing on
Palestinian protesters at the Gaza border]{.underline}** in what the UN
says may be potential war crimes.

**[Weapons]{.underline}** approved for **[sale]{.underline}**
**[included ammunition, components for assault rifles,]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** other types of **[arms which could be used for
repression]{.underline}**, according to newly released details from the
Department of International Trade (DIT), compiled by the Campaign
Against the Arms Trade (CAAT).

Revelations of the sales to Israel come after a UK court ordered the
British government last week to stop approving arms sales to Saudi
Arabia because it failed to fully assess whether the equipment might be
used in breach of international humanitarian law in the war in Yemen.

**[One sale]{.underline}** for more than \$125,000-worth of military
training equipment was **[approved]{.underline}** on 18 May last year,
**[four days after 68 Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops on the
most deadly day in Gaza since the 2014 Israeli offensive]{.underline}**.

The DIT declined to give MEE more details about the equipment and how it
could be used.

The sale was approved the same week Prime Minister Theresa May called
the Palestinian killings \"extremely concerning,\" and said there was an
urgent need to find out why Israeli forces had used live fire.

\"While we do not question the right of Israel to defend its borders,
the use of live fire and the resulting loss of life is deeply
troubling,\" May [said in a 15 May press
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n54uR_vs1E). \"We urge
Israel to show restraint.\"

**[The violence at the border was debated in parliament]{.underline}**
on the same day, with [seven MPs
calling](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-05-15/debates/D6170F50-D03A-40D8-B257-5C2A55493561/GazaBorderViolence) for
greater scrutiny of arms sales to Israel and some calling for an
outright ban.

**[But the approval of licences continued,]{.underline}** including
military radar equipment, missile technology and night-vision gear,
totalling about \$18m between 30 March until the end of the year.

That figure **[does not include sales that were approved
through]{.underline}** what are called **[open licences]{.underline}**,
**[where]{.underline}**by UK **[firms are not required to publicly
disclose the values of arms]{.underline}** or quantities sold.

#### Arms Sales aren't enough -- Trump's outward support and visit thumps

**[Keinon 17]{.underline}** (Herb, BA in Political Science from the
University of Colorado, "Trump, Israel, and the Importance of Symbols",
<https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Trump-Israel-and-the-importance-of-symbols-493578>,
NR)

There will be those who will be embarrassed to hear Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu tell the president that "there is no city on earth
where you are more welcome, than right here with us in Jerusalem."\
\
Why, they ask, is Israel pulling out all the stops to welcome a man who
is boorish, unpredictable, and -- the hyperbolic among them will argue
-- a threat to America's democracy? Why? Because **[he is the elected
leader of Israel's most important ally]{.underline}** in the world, and
a man whom with this **[visit is sending a strong signal to Israel's
enemies]{.underline}** that the US stands full-square behind it.

**[This is what Israel cares about]{.underline}**, far more than Trump's
firing of former FBI chief James Comey, or his reportedly telling Comey
to "go easy" on ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\
\
Comey, Flynn, the appointment of a new special prosecutor to investigate
ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and charges of Trump
possibly "obstructing justice" are the stories making the headlines in
the US. But while those stories may be bringing him down a peg in the
eyes of some Americans, for most Israelis they matter not a whit: what
matters is his support, and this trip -- both its choreography and his
public statements -- underscore that support.\
\
First there is the very fact of the trip itself.

**[Israelis yearn for a hearty embrace from US
presidents]{.underline}**. A handshake, a peck on the cheek is not
enough for the country's insecure psyche. Israel needs a full bodied hug
to feel secure. **[It is also important for Israel that its enemies see
that embrace]{.underline}**.\
\
This is one of the problems the country had with former President Barack
Obama. It took Obama more than four years to make his first presidential
visit to Israel, even though it took him less than six months to visit
other countries in the region: Turkey in April of 2009, and Saudi Arabia
and Egypt in June of that year. That was noticed in Jerusalem, and
elsewhere, and set the US-Israeli relationship off on the wrong foot.\
\
Obama came to Israel on the first leg of his first visit abroad in his
second term.\
\
**[Trump]{.underline}**, in marked contrast, has come on the second leg
of his first trip abroad in his first term. And he **[stressed
that]{.underline}** fact in public statements.\
\
**["We love Israel, we respect Israel]{.underline}**," he said upon
landing. **["And I send your people the warmest greetings from your
friend and ally]{.underline}**, all of the people in the United States
of America." That is a message Israel is very keen on the world hearing.

By its nature, a **[28-hour visit is going to be more symbolic than
substantive, so the symbols themselves take on greater
meaning]{.underline}**.\
\
His **[visiting Israel on his first trip was only one
symbol]{.underline}**. There was **[also the symbolism of]{.underline}**
his **[flying directly from Riyadh to Tel Aviv]{.underline}**, believed
to **[the first time this has been done,]{.underline}** with the Saudis
up until now forbidding any such flights **[because it might perceived
as direct public ties with a country]{.underline}** with whom it is
**[still in]{.underline}** a state of **[war]{.underline}**.\
\
Trump said in the afternoon the Saudis have a "very positive" view of
Israel, and this direct flight was a small symbol of changing
attitudes.\
\
But the **[most powerful symbol was Trump's visit to the Western Wall,
the first sitting US president to touch the wall's ancient
stones]{.underline}**. And although that visit may not have been
everything Israel wanted, since Netanyahu was not allowed to accompany
him, Trump was met there by the rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel
Rabinowitz, and was photographed with a kippa on his head, touching the
wall and putting in a note.

#### US will still embolden the Israeli extremist right -- Christian Zionism in politics and society

**[Fink 14]{.underline}** (Steven, University of Wisconsin Eau-Claire,
leading expert in crisis management and communications, "Fear Under
Construction: Islamophobia Within American Christian Zionism",
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13169/islastudj.2.1.0026#metadata_info_tab_contents>,
NR)

This statement by Walid Shoebat (2010: 137) encapsulates a **[view of
Islam which is commonly presented by leaders of American Christian
Zionism]{.underline}**, a subsection of American evangelical
Christianity which **[emphasizes unwavering support for the nation of
Israel]{.underline}**. Reflecting the Orientalist tendency of
constructing degrading monolithic caricatures of Islam and Muslims,
**[these leaders construct essentialist depictions which play a powerful
role in shaping Christian Zionist laypeople's conceptions of Muslims in
general and Palestinian Muslims in particular]{.underline}**. Seeking to
gauge Christian Zionism's place within the landscape of American
evangelical Christianity, it is **[difficult to determine the actual
number of Christian Zionists in the United States]{.underline}**.
Shortly before his death in 2007, Christian Zionist pastor Jerry Falwell
claimed that this figure exceeded 100 million, but Norton Mezvinsky
claims that the number in 2009 was probably in the range of 50-60
million (2010: 41-42). Although Falwell's amount was most likely
exaggerated, Mezvinsky's estimate demonstrates a significant Christian
Zionist presence in the United States, and therefore a **[large number
of Americans who are regularly exposed to anti-Islamic discourse which
can strongly affect their views about Palestinians.]{.underline}**

A major emphasis in Christian Zionist teaching is eschatological,
focusing on future events. Despite variations in the specific details of
what exactly will transpire, a **[fundamental Christian Zionist belief
is that Jesus will take his true believers into heaven during the
rapture and will subsequently return to earth, but only after
Israe]{.underline}**l, especially Jerusalem, is completely under Jewish
control and contains a majority Jewish population. **[Palestinians are
the adversary, since their presence and influence in the region must be
greatly diminished, if not obliterated, for the desired eschatological
events to occur. Presenting this apocalyptic view, Christian Zionist
leaders provide their congregations and readers with a sense of personal
purpose, as their choice to support Israel rather than Palestinians
takes on cosmic importance, advancing these eschatological events.
Moreover, negative portrayals of Palestinians function importantly
within Christian Zionist eschatology in order to uphold foundational
tenets regarding the justice of God. Constructing Palestinians as
irremediably prone to violence and other forms of evil, Christian
Zionist leaders suggest there would be no reason to question the belief
that God will destroy them in the end times. Albeit directly responsible
for the annihilation of a multitude of Palestinians, God is exonerated
in Christian Zionist eyes.]{.underline}**
