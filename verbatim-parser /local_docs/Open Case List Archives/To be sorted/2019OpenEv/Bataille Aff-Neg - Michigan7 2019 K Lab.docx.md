#### War is ontologically constitutive, an immanent condition of life as such. Only by ignoring this fact and renouncing sovereign, mystical experiences does a militaristic vision of total warfare possible. 

**Wilson 05.** Julie, "Unproductive expenditure and the spatial ground
of the earth: Bataille on the other side of Deleuze and Guattari" - EE -
Sep 26, 2005 <http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpbataille6.htm>

Both [Bataille and Deleuze & Guattari's ontological projects are fueled
by attempts to understand the most radical of human movements through a
conceptualization of war and its different forms]{.underline}. These
[[different forms of war are absolutely fundamental for grasping the
political]{.mark} claims of each project, not to mention the stakes that
surround the category of unproductive expenditure]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} the thought of [**Bataille two different forms of war
emerge: [war as mystical or inner experience, and war in the more
conventional sense as death and destruction on the
battlefiel]{.mark}**[d]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of Bataille's wartime
writings can be read as attempts to see an equivalence between actual
war and mystical experience. In his book Saints of the Impossible:
Bataille, Weil, and the Politics of the Sacred, Alexander Irwin
references Bataille's own words in "The Practice of Joy before Death:"
"'I want to show that [[an equivalence exists between war, ritual
sacrifice, and the mystical life.' All these forms of behavior reflect
'the same play of 'ecstasies' and 'terrors']{.mark} in which man joins
in the games of heaven']{.underline}"(136).
**[[Bataille]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus **[[sees a fundamental
similarity between the violence of the battlefield and mysticism in the
ecstasy and terror that characterize both
experiences]{.mark};]{.underline}** his insistence on the equivalence
stems from both his energetic framework\-- better known as general
economy\-- and the latter's commitment to [thinking through the category
of unproductive expenditure, or the moment when production]{.underline}
(and/or growth) [has reached its terrestrial limits and must turn
unproductive, or rather, destructive of energetic
resources.]{.underline} For Bataille, [the emergence of war in both
instances is intimately bound up in the category of unproductive
expenditure]{.underline}; in fact, **[[war is the moment and movement of
unproductive expenditure, or profitless
expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the energeticist ontology of
Bataille, [[**unproductive expenditure---consumptions and
dissipations---are linked to the realm of the necessary; thus, so is
war**.]{.mark} In "The Practice of Joy before Death," Bataille writes[:
"'I MYSELF AM WAR.']{.mark}]{.underline} [[I imagine human movement and
excitation, whose possibilities are limitless: this movement and
excitation can only be appeased by war]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Visions of
Excess, 239). [**[War]{.underline}**,]{.mark} for Bataille, **[[is the
necessary and universal response to expansive and growth-seeking
being;]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this sense, [war as profitless
expenditure is fundamental to maintaining the balance of forces on
Earth.]{.underline} **[[War (and thus unproductive expenditure) engender
destructions of forces and energies,]{.mark}]{.underline}** but what
[Bataille desperately wants us to understand]{.underline} is [that
[**although war in-itself is immanent to and necessary for life, the
form it will take is not an a priori**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In Volume
One of The Accursed Share, Bataille clarifies the central claims of his
ontological project: [[The living organism]{.mark},]{.underline} in a
situation **[[determined by the play of energy on the surface of the
globe, ordinarily receives more energy than is necessary for maintaining
life; the excess energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (wealth) [[can be used
for the growth of the system]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., an organism);
[[if the system can no longer grow, or if the excess cannot be
completely absorbed in growth, it must necessarily be lost without
profit; it must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or
catastrophically]{.underline}]{.mark} (21). [**[We can ignore or forget
the fact that the ground we live on is little other than a field of
multiple destructions]{.mark}.** Our ignorance only has this
incontestable effect: It causes us to undergo what we could bring about
in our own way]{.underline}, if we understood (23). Here we see clearly
[**[the two faces of war or unproductive expenditure]{.underline}**:
[the catastrophic war that destroys life through violence turned against
peoples/ war experienced as undergone; and the glorious inner experience
of the mystic/ war brought about in one's own way]{.underline}. [In the
case of actual war, unproductive expenditure is the privilege of the
ruling classes; in inner experience, unproductive expenditure is a
sovereign moment or movement of desiring
subjects]{.underline}.]{.mark}Deleuze & Guattari's work follows a
similar structure evidenced in the concept of the war machine. In the
nomadology plateau of A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,
Deleuze & Guattari differentiate between the war machine that takes war
for its object and the war machine that draws a creative line of flight.
They write:The war machine is not uniformly defined, we have tried to
define [the two poles of]{.underline} the [war]{.underline} machine[: at
one pole, [it takes war for its object and forms a line of destruction
prolongable to the limits of the universe]{.mark}]{.underline}[. But [in
all of the shapes it assumes here---**limited war, total war, worldwide
organization**]{.underline}---[war represents not]{.underline}]{.mark}
at all [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} supposed [[essence of]{.mark} the
[war]{.mark} machine [but]{.mark}]{.underline} [only]{.mark}, whatever
the machine's power, either [[the set of conditions under which the
States appropriate the machine...or the dominant order of which the
States themselves are now only parts]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The other
pole]{.underline} seemed to be the essence: it [is when the war
machine...has as its object not war but the drawing of a creative line
of flight, the composition of smooth space and the movement of a people
in that space]{.underline}...(422).

#### The ontological condition of warfare is expressed throughout history -- violence and aggression are essential traits of culture and society. Sure, we try to hide this fact from ourselves, we try to neglect the way we are seduced by conflict -- but this neglect is what makes more insidious and horrific forms of violence possible.

Robertson Jeffers, "Skunks") Nobody remembers the Armenians In the
"second talk on Poland" in Obersaltzberg, August 22, 1939, speaking to
Reichmarshal Hermann Goering and the other commanding generals, Hitler
advised brutality and mercilessness in their assault on Poland, for the
sake of "a quick victory" that would begin his "new distribution of the
world" (New York Times, November 24, 1945, Vol LCV, No 32, p 081).
Successful state-building is for great men. Mercy and compassion are for
weaklings, he argued. The world only remembers the strong and history
records the most brutal tyrants as "successful state-builders." History
purifies, asserted Hitler, and it purifies universally. He illustrated
this by asking the arresting question: "Who still talks nowadays of the
extermination of the Armenians?" Louis Lochner reported on the speech.
Lochner tells: "Goering jumped on the table. Blood-thirsty thanks and
bloody promises. He danced around like a savage. The few doubtful ones
remained silent." Lochner, a top rate reporter, more than two decades
chief of the Berlin Bureau of the Associated Press, demonstrates how the
purifying sleight of hand functions so effectively to isolate the evil
monstrous at a safe distance from the "human" site of responsibility. In
this report, Lochner succumbs to the very "logic of purification" that

reporter coolly recording the facts that will become history. When
Hitler notes that none of us remembers the Armenians, he underscores an
almost universal "human" feature: **[none of us remembers the victims of
past spectacular human crimes any more than we give but passing notice
to the ongoing holocausts that, daily, snuff out lives around the globe.
We are all highly accomplished at forgetting the worst human crimes,
and, most significantly, of forgetting our own complicity in the
greatest---because daily---violences]{.underline}**. So [easily we
forget our personal failings, our culture's depraved roots, our species'
primal violence]{.underline}s. So conveniently [we distance ourselves
from responsibility and from remorse]{.underline}. Hitler, the madman,
the "monster," knew human beings better than we know ourselves.
[**[Hitler was right about all of us!]{.underline}** **[We are all
innocent in our culpability.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The worst crimes
fall into oblivion for very comprehensible reasons. In an important
article, "Penser les Massacres," Belgian political scientist Jacques

**[problems]{.underline}**]{.mark} that **[[turn]{.mark} even
[researchers away from]{.mark} consideration of [the]{.mark} worst
[human violences]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Semelin, 2001, p 1). The [first
is [psychological]{.mark}]{.underline} in nature: [[avoiding]{.mark} a
[research]{.mark} topic that [triggers]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[horror]{.underline}]{.mark} and repulsion [is
understandable]{.underline}. The second is [[moral: faced
with]{.underline}]{.mark} acts of pure [[savagery, how is it possible to
prove]{.mark} "scientific [neutrality]{.mark}]{.underline}"? The
[compassion]{.underline} felt for the victims [leads]{.underline}
spontaneously [to]{.underline} the [condemnation]{.underline} of their
torturers. The third obstacle is more specifically of an intellectual
nature: [the phenomenon of [massacre defies
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It appears to have no
"sense,"]{.mark} nor to "serve" any purpose.]{.underline} We tend to
write it off as man's "folly." It is easy to understand the why of our
forgetting. In this paper, I shall propose an explanation of how we
accomplish that expiatory feat. I shall seek to define [the "logic of
[purification]{.mark}]{.underline}" that Hitler claimed [guides the
crafting of history and [sanitizes our collective
consciences]{.mark}]{.underline}, by exposing **[a purification
[mechanism]{.mark} that has been "[ritualized]{.mark}" [into our
very]{.mark} ways of [being]{.mark}, [into]{.mark} the parameters of
[the lifeworld,]{.mark} and perhaps [even]{.mark} into [our
flesh]{.mark}, by obsessive repetition]{.underline}** in the early
millennia of human time. Arguing from the theories of prominent
anthropologists, I shall propose the development and persistence of a
certain conceptual and linguistic mechanisms that removes past horrors
from their discomfiting proximity and especially from the scope of
personal and cultural responsibility by displacing evil onto alien
others in proximity to our "sacred" home space. My claim is that [[human
beings]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the dawn of human time, [[developed
a]{.mark} concealing and [sorting]{.mark} [mechanism that
permitted]{.mark} the easy [forgetting of their own murderous ways of
being-together]{.mark}]{.underline}---[ways that]{.underline}, as Konrad
Lorenz, Rene´ Girard, Walter Burkert, Paul Radin and other
[anthropologists have shown, are fundamentally murderous.]{.underline}
[We witness the persistence of this purifying mechanism]{.underline} in
the very ways in which we make moral judgments, [in the way
we]{.underline}, still today, [isolate]{.underline} and illuminate as
"[evil]{.underline}" the unsettling [forces at work around

reconstructive maneuver to its primal formulations, looking back to the
time our earliest ancestors crawled down from their arboreal paradises
and stood upright on the savannah. By a consideration of the primal
violences from which we, as human beings (and our systems and
institutions), have sprung, I will attempt to expose the origins of the
modes of moral thinking that underpin the sanctity of our home spaces,
while yet disposing us toward certain violent modes of
being-in-the-world. Then I shall mark out traces of a [post-holocaust
philosophical insight]{.underline} that [threatens to collapse the
ritualized logic and its concomitant distancing]{.underline} maneuver,
first by following Primo Levi into the death camps of Buna and
Auschwitz, and finally, by embarking **[[on a disturbing hypothetical
journey into the netherworld of human "nature" exposed by]{.mark}
Georges [Bataille in his disturbing account of human being as the
"enraged torturer]{.mark}.]{.underline}**" From purification rituals
Walter Burkert, anthropologist and classical philologist at the
University of Zurich, takes up the project of understanding human
violence by wedding historical and philological research to biological
anthropology. In a most impressive corpus (Homo Necans, Structure and
History in Greek Mythology, Greek Tragedy and Sacrificial Ritual, The
Creation of the Sacred, Ancient Mystery Cults, Greek Religion), Burkert
traces the origin of human "civilizing" processes into the distant past
of human existence. Burkert originally assigned to the classical
tradition profound importance for Western intellectual and cultural
beginnings. But, in the course of his research, his investigations led
him to a remarkable discovery. The classical tradition was itself
permeated with symbols persisting from much earlier epochs of human
time. Burkert came to see that, even in the highest period of classical
culture, patterns of thought and activity, "ritualized" in pre-Greek
cultures and perhaps even prehistoric in origin, continued to exercise
an unshakeable hold over the fifth century Greeks, even though cultural
and religious "meanings" of these rituals had long fallen from the
conscious memory of the practitioners. The bloody sacrifice ritual is
one such pervasive anomaly that continued to accompany festivals, seats
of oracles, cult gatherings, mystery ceremonies, athletic games, Greek
theater, state ceremonies and funeral services long after that ritual
had any meaningful resonances with the events or with the beliefs of the
participants of those events. Burkert's inquiry into the uncanny
endurance of such rituals eventually led him to another astounding
insight: [rituals function in such a manner that they do not require
either conscious belief or even understanding in order to remain
functionally operative and ideologically persistent. That is to say,
even where their story (logos) has been lost or seemingly disconnected
from the cultural context, their]{.underline} [ideology]{.underline}
(the eidoi of their logos---the form and symbols of their story)
[remains enduringly persistent and functional]{.underline}. To discover
what the archaic logoi might be communicating to those later
generations, Burkert looks back to the rituals performed pervasively in
the early millennia of the Western tradition. Anthropologists like
Konrad Lorenz had carved out this intellectual territory. Lorenz,
writing in the 1960s, had shocked the anthropological world with the
disturbing revelation that **[[murderousness is]{.mark} the human
being's [primal state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In his Nobel prize winning
On Aggression, Lorenz had unfolded the tale of human beginnings as the
"grotesque perversion" of a natural selective process. In a particularly
disturbing passage, Lorenz states: [There is evidence that the first
[inventors of pebble tools]{.mark},]{.underline} the African
[Australopithecines]{.underline}, [promptly [used]{.mark} their new
weapon [to kill]{.mark} not only game but fellow members of their
species as well.]{.underline} [[Peking Man]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
Prometheus]{.underline} who learned [to preserve]{.underline} fire[,
[used it to roast his brothers]{.mark}:]{.underline} [beside the first
traces of]{.underline} the regular use of [fire lie the]{.underline}
mutilated and [roasted bones]{.underline} of sinanthropos pekinensis
himself. (Lorenz, 1966, p 239) Perhaps Lorenz's most troubling discovery
was that **[the [first men were murderous]{.mark}, [not because they
lacked the "civilizing effects" of cultural development, but precisely
because of their cultural proficiencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark}, beginning with the mastery of fire,
[[evolved]{.mark} quickly from beings tyrannized by economic insecurity
[into beings who controlled]{.mark} and created their
[environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[From that point]{.mark}
onward]{.underline}, explains Lorenz, the natural selective tendencies
that, in animals and earlier humans, served important [evolutionary
purposes]{.underline} (maintaining an even spatial distribution of
groups within the species and favoring species continuance by selecting
the hardier to excel both territorially and sexually), [began to go
astray.]{.underline} **[[Aggressive tendencies]{.mark}, when
uninfluenced by environmental exigencies, can [run amuck in
directions]{.mark} that are [maladaptive to the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This is what happened to
humans]{.underline}, Lorenz explains. Their **[[aggressive behaviors
became "exaggerated to the point of the]{.mark} [grotesque]{.mark} and
the inexpedient"]{.underline}**(Lorenz, 1966, p 42). At a very early
stage in human development, intra-specific aggression was already
replacing species defense with species offence in the form of brutal
wars waged against neighboring tribes, and even between brothers,
fathers and sons within the social group. [Selective processes, gone
astray, expressed themselves in elaborate rituals of aggressive prowess
aimed at human others]{.underline}. Lorenz is convinced that **[we are
fundamentally prone toward intra-specific aggression]{.underline}**. In
fact, **[it is only through further perversions of our "grotesque and
inexpedient" perversions that we learn to love and nurture at
all.]{.underline}** [**[Rituals of love]{.mark} and friendship
[emerged]{.mark} for human communities [as]{.mark} reformulations of
[displays of]{.mark} redirected [aggression]{.mark} and ceremonies of
appeasement.** [Aggression is thousands of years older, more
time-honored in our ritual heritage, more deeply embedded in our being,
than love or friendship or nurturance]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to
Lorenz, **[[violent urges are fundamental to]{.mark} the way of
[being]{.mark} of humankind.]{.underline}** He states:
"**[[intra-specific aggression can]{.mark} certainly [exist without its
counterpart]{.mark}, love, [but]{.mark} conversely [there is no love
without aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Lorenz, 1966, p 214).
Lorenz's insights informed the anthropological community that the rich
palette of ritual WENDY C. HAMBLETT 132 Downloaded by \[University of
Michigan\] at 01:02 29 October 2015 [practices evidenced in early
hominoids were fundamentally of a single kind--- murderous rituals aimed
at other human beings.]{.underline} Walter Burkert takes up the task of
tracing the murderous rituals into early human communities centered
about life's most significant functions---hunting, warfare, and mating.
Though he resists the full endorsement of the thesis that founds
sociobiology (the co-evolution of genes and culture), Burkert does posit
in the distant past of human existence the advent of a "common mental
world" whose symbolic content and tenor of seriousness he believes to
have been transmitted through the ages and into modernity through an
uninterrupted chain of tradition. That chain of tradition is the ritual
history of human culture, with its systems, its institutions, its social
and economic practices, and, above all, the conceptual and linguistic
systems (the symbols and the logic connecting those symbols) that
configure these ways of being-in-the-world. [We only need look around us
to see those "perverted elaborations"]{.underline} of which Lorenz
speaks [still at work in the world today]{.underline}: in the
[swaggering machismo of males in many patriarchal societies across the
globe; in the overblown bravado of Western cinema and television heroes;
in [the "warrior virtues" displayed on the hockey rinks and football
fields, in the rhetoric of gun lobbyist groups; in the way young boys
thrash each other in the schoolyards and young men brawl in barrooms; in
the rhetoric of Western news media that name "terrorist" all opponents
of Western values and actions and Western terrorisms as legitimate
battles fought "for freedom and democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}."
**[[Successful "state-building"]{.mark} has always been [accomplished
in]{.mark} the ways of [Genghis]{.mark} [and Hitler.]{.mark} But [since
this]{.mark} fact [makes for bad conscience we reconfigure]{.mark} our
enemies as demons, our [home spaces as sacre]{.mark}d and pure [and our
violent histories]{.mark} (the rape of the Americas, the slave trade,
civil wars, current social and political oppression) [as occasions for
celebration]{.mark} (Columbus Day, Independence Day).]{.underline}** How
is this reinterpretive maneuver accomplished, then? Burkert contends
that the creative confusion began in the early days of the Paleolithic
hunt. In the hunt, the intense collective energies of anxiety and terror
that had to be focused upon large carnivores by human beings armed only
with fire-hardened weapons heightened the significance of the event far
beyond the mere gathering of food. A full range of survival strategies
had to be summoned in order for the hunt to prove successful. This meant
that patterns of behavior within the group (those regulating feeding
habits, pairing, sexuality, reproduction, care of weaker members,
territory, leadership, allegiances and other methodologies of
cooperation) had to be realigned and concretized. **[[Behavior
codes]{.mark} ("rituals" in ethological parlance) resulted [to
sublimate]{.mark} and rechannel the old [intra-specific
aggressions]{.mark} to accomplish the cooperative solidarity that [would
ensure the success of the hunt]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The first rituals
probably circumscribed pre-hunt ceremonies that called forth the power
of the ancestors, charmed the prey into the territory and contracted its
"consent" to the immanent killing. Eventually, explains Burkert, [the
ritual field would have expanded to embrace all aspects of the
hunt---the murder and the post-murder festivities.]{.underline} **[[This
led]{.mark}, eventually, [to]{.mark} the articulation of every manner of
social code---[prohibitions and prescriptions]{.mark}]{.underline}**

inverted into festivity in the celebration of the living death and the
beneficence of the self-sacrificial victim/prey monster/god who blesses
the community with harmony and full stomachs.]{.underline}** [Thus the
animal, while remaining animal, became anthropomorphized and
divinized]{.underline}. It assumed **[[contrasting

[**[predator]{.underline}**/**[friend]{.underline}**]{.mark} of man,
**[evil/beneficent]{.underline}**, lifegiving/death-giving,
**[demon/god]{.underline}**. In time the polar symbols of these rituals
developed into a full cosmos-embracing hierarchy that comprised the
"common mental world" shared by the group. Burkert explains how this
"common mental world" functions. [All tradition consists of condensed,
systematized information that keep conceptual systems
finite]{.underline}. **[[Ritual traditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
communicate strategies of negation and mechanisms of class/ gender
inclusion and exclusion. That is, they **[[convey]{.mark} a "logic of
[domination"]{.mark} that [reasserts]{.mark} the [s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark} of socioeconomic and political [realities]{.mark} by
supplying constitutive patterns and analogies [that structure thought
and action]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bloch, 1992, p 7). Through these
strategies, **[[a "reduction of complexity" is achieved]{.mark} that
[sorts the confusing chaos of sense data into a simplified system
of]{.mark} [meanings to orient human]{.mark} being[s]{.mark} who,
[otherwise]{.mark}, would feel [helpless]{.mark}, engulfed and
overwhelmed [by]{.mark} the infinite [complexity]{.mark} of their
environment]{.underline}**. One essential way this reduction of
complexity is achieved, explains Burkert, is through the positing of
"dual containers," the legacy of the polarized logic of the hunt.
Phenomena are, by virtue of these "containers," sorted into meaningful
events: good--bad, sacred--profane, pure--impure, friend--enemy,
god--demon, beneficent--demonic. From these dualities, **[[hierarchies
are constructed]{.mark} and links of causality forged [so]{.mark} that
[reality can be reduced to simple]{.mark} and general
[concepts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A radically simplified, polarized
worldview can be most useful as an orienting system. Add to this an
ultimate signifier (god, king, president, pope, chief, father) and even
the conflicting equations of life can be easily resolved, as matters to
be left to a higher wisdom. [[Through]{.mark} such [ritual]{.mark}ized
[orderings]{.mark}, then, [a culture's]{.mark} collective
[representations are]{.mark} constructed and [communicated to]{.mark}
the young of [each]{.mark} [successive generation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Rituals comprise, for Burkert, "the very epitome of cultural learning"
(Burkert, 1996, pp 28--29). It is not merely that the violent rituals
practiced throughout human history were self-reinforcing by the power of
resonance (though it is that WENDY C. HAMBLETT 134 Downloaded by
\[University of Michigan\] at 01:02 29 October 2015 too), it was how
they were made to resonate in the bodies of the participants. Ritual
learning, historically, took harsh, intimidating forms. [Learning is
most indelible where memories are painful, humiliating, or
anxiety-ridden, behaviorists assure us]{.underline}. Ancient ritual
practices centered about animal and human sacrifices, painful
purgatorial purifications and excruciating physical mutilations. Terror
and pain leave indelible scars. Thus Burkert concludes that the
horrifying, agonizing rituals etched into the flesh of each subsequent
generation a radically over-simpli- fied polarized worldview and a logic
of domination that reasserted as "legitimate" the historical order,
precisely by carving out clear boundaries between sacred community and
demonic alien forces. Thus was a culture marked self-identical across
the flux of time and re-legitimized by connection with the changeless
eternality of the ancestors and the gods.

#### The modern nation state is the institutionalization of war throughout society, the subordination of all to principles of rational utility. The perfection of such a reactive nihilism is life-denying fascism. The affirmative's attempt to flee all violence or to sublimate it into purified forms results in ever-increasing cycles of violence, met with ever more profound boredom. You must respect the sovereignty of others by dissolving into a genuine ecstasy and delight before violence.

Eli Sagan's At the Dawn of Tyranny posits the advent of civilization as
coincidental with the dawn of tyranny and oppression. [[War]{.mark}, one
of the oldest human institutions, [has proven invaluable to
states]{.mark} in [establishing]{.mark} their [power]{.mark} over
subgroups within the system, as well as in acquiring territories from
neighboring peoples to permit their expansion in space and power.
Because of war's great functionality to the state, there remains little
mystery to the long-term success of war as a state institution over the
formative millennia of civilization]{.underline}. The continuing
popularity of war among modern states ostensibly dedicated to democracy,
freedom, and the dignity of human beings, remains baffling to violence
scholars. Karl von Clausewitz's On War, considered by many scholars to
be the canonical treatment of the war philosophy, attributes to war a
logic all its own: war composes a compulsion, a dynamic that aims at
excessive overflow, absolute expenditure of the energies of the state.
[[War]{.mark} seeks absolutization as it [feeds]{.mark} and fires [the
population's]{.mark} martial [enthusiasm]{.mark}; [if unchecked]{.mark}
by political goals, [war will fulfill itself in]{.mark} the maximum
exertion of self-expenditure---[self-annihilation**. War
composes**]{.mark} **a potlatch of [state resources]{.mark}, [a]{.mark}
useless [splurge of]{.mark} the nation's human and economic [wealth
for]{.mark} no better reason than [wanton]{.mark} celebration of [state
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The language of absolute expenditure
resonates with the philosophy of Georges Bataille. His philosophy
explains **[two [principles of expenditure]{.mark}--- the principle of
[classical utility]{.mark} defined by utilitarian goals serving current
power relations, [and]{.mark} that of [nonproductive
expenditure]{.mark}---that is, [orgiastic outflow]{.mark} or ek-stasis
that [escapes mundane servitude to reason]{.mark} [and
utility]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Political implications of the two
economies are exposed in Bataille's "Propositions on Fascism." There,
[the two dialectical opposites represent extreme possibilities for the
state structures.]{.underline} [The first model aspires to perfect
order, like the timeless realm of the gods, a frozen homogeneous
perfection that is monocephalic (single-headed). Like the god, the
monocephalic state becomes self-identified as a sacred
entity---changeless, eternal, and perfect, its laws and customs fixed
and imperative.]{.underline}

[[At the other end]{.underline}]{.mark} of the structural spectrum
[[resides the]{.underline}]{.mark} second form of state---the
[[acephalic state]{.mark}---[disordered]{.mark}, anarchic, and
volatile]{.underline}. [[This state is]{.mark} seen by ordered states as
a [terrifying]{.mark}, heterogeneous primitive [lifeform]{.mark} where
[uncivilized tribes practice **mystical** **thinking**]{.mark},
incommensurable truths, and **[mad]{.mark} affective
[experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Unreasonable. Useless.
Mad.]{.underline} **[[People within]{.mark} the [acephalic social
structure enjoy]{.mark} abundant [ritual lives that offer escape from
the mundane]{.mark} [in orgiastic festivals]{.mark} involving
drunkenness, dancing, blood rites, wanton tortures, [self-mutilation,
and]{.mark} even [murder]{.mark} in the name of dark monster
gods.]{.underline}** [The monocephalic state, on the other hand, has
overcome all death.]{.underline} [The civilized state boasts an
enlightened stable form that promotes reason, life, and progress,
whereas]{.underline} [the primitive society is referred to chaos,
madness, and death]{.underline}. **[Bataille's dichotomy provides a
valuable framework for analyzing global realities, even in the modern
world]{.underline}**. Because Bataille insists the models represent dual
extreme possibilities in the cyclical evolution of all states, then a[ll
states seek timeless stability, secured against time with absolute truth
claims, infallible social codes, and enduring legislation.]{.underline}
**[[States are]{.mark} duly [secured by]{.mark} the legalized violence
of police and [military]{.mark} that appropriate the illegal
[violence]{.mark} of the people and ultimately [suppress]{.mark} all
[transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Intricate [unyielding]{.mark}
[systems of rules]{.mark} and regulations---passports, licenses,
[identity cards]{.mark}, forms completed in triplicate, travel
[restrictions]{.mark}, immigration regulations, police interrogations,
surveillance of social and financial transactions among subgroups,
security checkpoints, departments of homeland security---**[weed
out]{.mark} the [deviant lifeforms until]{.mark} ultimately all
countervoices have been silenced, all [rebellion]{.mark} quite
[obliterated]{.mark}, all evolutionary movement logically
contradictory**]{.underline}. But, at this evolutionary apex, **[a
problem arises in paradise. As [the]{.mark} monocephalic [state]{.mark}
increasingly closes itself off, it [stifles social existence]{.mark},
[smothers creative]{.mark} [energies]{.mark}, chokes the passion from
its citizen-devotees, [suffocates]{.mark} their [spiritual urges, and
reduces all]{.mark} sacrifices [to mundane utility]{.mark}. When
[the]{.mark} [perfect]{.mark} eternality of the [structure is
complete]{.mark} and the nation duly deified, all [labors have
become]{.mark} co-opted in utter [servitude]{.mark}. [Bataille names
this culminating stage of development, the peaceful, stable end sought
by all states, in its most excessive
extrapolation]{.mark}---[fascism]{.mark}. Ultimately, however, [life and
time must break free and move forward]{.mark} into futures. [This most
solid state holds firm for a short while only; then there begins a
condensation of forces. Life rises up and explodes the suffocating
stasis, disintegrating the solid, erect whole. Existence and liberty
flow forth in rage, blood, tears, and passion. The death of God is
complete]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Bataille, [these endless cycles
describe the movement of history]{.underline}: [the erection of unitary
gods of knowledge and power that ultimately ossify into totalities, and
then explode in hysterical, raging catastrophes, releasing the explosive
liberty of life from mundane servitude.]{.underline} [The acephalic
chaos will eventually recompose, slowly heaving up an ugly divine head
once again]{.underline}. **[[Life turns back on its chaotic
freedom]{.mark} [and develops]{.mark} what Bataille calls [an aversion
to]{.mark} the initial [decomposition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
chaotic structure moves from the ek-stasis bliss of wanton pleasures and
pains toward the stasis of the deity once again. **[[Time,]{.mark}
[states, and]{.mark} human [individuals]{.mark}, for Bataille, [move
between]{.mark} the two [contradictory forms]{.mark}: stasis and
ek-stasis]{.underline}**. **[Time demands both forms in the world---the
eternal return of an imperative object, and the explosive, creative,
destructive rage of the liberty of life.]{.underline}** [Bataille's
analysis of state evolution offers resolution to the mystery of the
frequency of wars in the modern civilized era]{.underline}: **[It
suggests that [war]{.mark} [composes]{.mark} a "[potlatch]{.mark}"---[a
manic ecstasy of useless]{.mark} self-[expenditure that permits a
breakout from mundane servitude]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

We may not readily recognize, in our states, the extreme forms that
Bataille describes---fascist stasis or chaotic ecstasy. [We believe
that, although chaos is unquestionably undesirable, fascism is promoted
only by madmen---Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin**. [We may be
convinced]{.mark} that [fascist urges fade with global]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark} where all people will, eventually, know the order and
security of the first world**]{.underline}. Modern Western states, we
may object, compose a golden mean between Bataille's two economies,
aspiring neither to fascism nor to a manic primitivism, but to the
reasonable metron of golden rules[. **[But the
roots]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the Western world [are]{.mark} well
[planted in the fascist drive for hyper-order]{.mark} and changeless
eternality]{.underline}**. Hesiod and the [PreSocratics]{.underline}, as
much as Jewish and Christian myth, [cite a common arche of the universe
in the good works of a god that renders order (cosmos) out of chaos
(kaos]{.underline}). For the ancients, one head (cephalus) is far
superior to many; simplicity is beauty, whereas the many compose hoi
poloi, an embarrassment of riches. **[[The]{.mark} foundational [logic
that posits]{.mark} monocephalic [order as ontologically]{.mark} and
morally [superior to]{.mark} acephalic [multivocity remains]{.mark} an
[unquestioned]{.mark} assumption [embedded in]{.mark} the [Western
life]{.mark}world]{.underline}**. [A single well-ordered edifice,
stretching high into the sky---erect, rigid, unyielding---is preferable,
in the Western mind, to the broadest playing field studded with
incongruous heroics]{.underline}. **[[Bataille's meditations]{.mark} on
the dark underside of reason's projects and triumphs, [on]{.mark} such
[prohibited subjects]{.mark} [as monstrous tortures, illicit sexual
excesses, and the colorful anuses of apes,]{.mark} [provide a theater of
cruelty]{.mark} and death that is [designed to challenge]{.mark} the
polite threshold of [civilized culture]{.mark}, [to shock and
interrupt]{.mark} the [philosophical tradition]{.mark} it invades, [and
to subvert]{.mark} the pretenses of [refined]{.mark}
[sophistication]{.mark} thought definitive of civilized society.
Bataille shows that [people are torn by conflicting drives]{.mark}, [by
lofty ideals, and by the dark concealed forces they suppress and
deny.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Lorenz states that [Bataille's treatment of the dark, concealed urges in
human nature offer resolution to the paradox of the simultaneous lofty
goals of modern states and the frequency of **brutal aggressions** by
those very states naming themselves the most civilized.]{.underline}
Perhaps **[the popularity and frequency of war even in the civilized
modern era represents the release of suppressed subterranean drives
within industrialized, rationalist, rigidly hierarchically ordered
populations enslaved to reason and utility.The [violence that floods the
globe]{.mark} in modernity, [that claims to be serving]{.mark}
reasonable projects of global [freedom and democracy]{.mark}, [may
represent]{.mark} [new forms expressing old desires]{.mark}, [the
projects of]{.mark} monocephalic [statehood aspiring to
deification]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Bataille recognizes chthonic forces
as instrumental in the modern world:]{.underline} "[The economic history
of modern times is dominated by the epic but disappointing effort of
fierce men to plunder the riches of the Earth \[and turn its fire and
metal into weapons\] \... . \[M\]an \[lives\] an existence at the mercy
of the merchandise he produces, the largest part of which is devoted to
death]{.underline}." [The fierce men of modernity]{.underline}---gods,
kings, and their modern sequels (presidents, popes, corporate
rulers)---[extend their control to the ends of the planet.]{.underline}
**[Fierce men disembowel the Earth and turn on their own kind the
products of molten metal torn from her bowels to ensure the permanence
of their nations.]{.underline}** **[[War]{.underline}]{.mark}**, states
Bataille, "**[[represents]{.mark} the [desperate obstinacy]{.mark} of
man [opposing]{.mark} the exuberant power of [time]{.mark} [and finding
security in]{.mark} an immobile and almost [somnolent
erection]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Bataille believes that primitive urges
are still at work in the projects of modernity. [Human beings, as much
as superstructures of power, must satisfy their dark urges for the good
of their communities.]{.underline} **[[They must release their death
drives if they are to gather together]{.mark} in heartfelt
communities]{.underline}**. **[[Human beings crave mystical, passionate,
frenzied escape from]{.mark} the rigorous projects of [their ordered
systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If Bataille is correct, [people must
ultimately break free from the mundane enterprises of their everyday
lives. Their inner demons will beckon them from their ordered worlds to
revel in orgiastic festival]{.underline}. Surely Bataille's claim---that
[life's erotic drives will out and fulfill themselves in deathly
destructiveness and wanton joy]{.underline}---[should trouble us
greatly, given the leveling effects of modern industrial society, its
will to mediocrity, utility, and conformity]{.underline}. But is
Bataille correct in his attribution of a measureless and rending
character to modern war? Is modern warfare the aimless catastrophe that
Bataille claims it to be? If so, then **[[modern wars can be
explained]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Bataille, **[[as ecstatic
release from the fascist orientation of modern]{.mark} ordered [states
and]{.mark} from [people's imprisonment]{.mark} within the
[merchandise]{.mark} they produce. [Modern war, with]{.mark} its [Shock
and Awe]{.mark} techno-[theatrics]{.mark}, [should provide a wondrous
release from]{.mark} mundane [servitude]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 42 WENDY
C. HAMBLET [War could be said to satisfy collective fantasies of manic
omnipotence and the drive for self-sacrifice for sacred
values]{.underline}. **[[Perhaps the wars of modernity]{.mark} [occur
with such]{.mark} rabid [frequency because people must satisfy
their]{.mark} suppressed [lust for a sexual]{.mark}ized [release from
the cold reality of state projects]{.mark}, the utilitarian reasons of
state]{.underline}**. This resonates with Clausewitz's claim that
**[people's martial [enthusiasm must find release in politically
restrained wars]{.mark} [or fulfill]{.mark} itself in [the maximum
exertion of self-expenditure]{.mark}, [that is,
self-annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For Clausewitz, **[[modernity
represents]{.mark} that unfettered stage [when war has escaped all
political bounds and]{.mark} reasonable
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although ostensibly a world driven by
the lofty goals, **[[modernity]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for
Clausewitz---**[[composes an era of absolute war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[The democratic revolution may have embraced other goals---citizen
welfare and the grandeur of their rulers---but democracy]{.underline},
for Clausewitz, [composes merely one of a number of crucial
forces]{.underline} (the scientific revolution that provides the
technology, the industrial revolution that provides mass production of
weaponry, and the imperialism that draws the entire globe into the war
system) [that have been successfully harnessed to the powerprojects of
the mightiest nations]{.underline}. **[[The goods of the]{.mark} modern
[West]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the good of [democracy]{.mark}, [exist
to extend Western hegemony]{.mark} globally [in the marketplace of
military power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [But]{.underline} Bataille claims
that **[[war is useless expenditure]{.mark}---[a release of the primal
urges]{.mark} of a community [toward excessive
overflow]{.mark}.]{.underline}** He states: "[Military existence is
based on a brutal negation of any profound meaning of death]{.underline}
and, if it uses cadavers, it is only to make the living march in a
straighter line." But, [if war is to be posited as an ecstatic release,
it must compose orgiastic overflow, an entirely useless and pointless
expenditure of the nation's finest goods.]{.underline} **[Excessive
[expenditure is defeated the moment]{.mark} the [violent
explosion]{.mark} of forces [serves mundane projects of]{.mark}
servitude and [utility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[When war
serves]{.mark} the purposes of [the state, it loses its]{.mark} manic
and [ecstatic character and ceases to fulfill]{.mark} the people's
[deep]{.mark}est [needs for release]{.mark} from servitude and
instrumentality]{.underline}**. But Bataille is mistaken; the apparent
uselessness of modern warfare is a deception, an illusion. War is one of
the oldest traditions of our species. It has become a timeworn vehicle
precisely because it serves a great many functions in states. Clausewitz
names the institution of war a form of communication between nations.
Franco Fornari states: "War is a multifunctional institution. \... It is
extremely difficult to find a substitute that would perform all of its
functions." One of the most crucial functions that war provides in
service of the state is the crystallization of its monopoly on violence.
War is a crucial aspect of the centralizing, evolutionary process that
culminates, ultimately, in fascist stability. [The establishment of a
massive and robust military is]{.underline} THE MANIC ECSTASY OF WAR 43
[utterly necessary to the deification of the structure and the raising
of a sturdy cephalus]{.underline}, because, [along with the creation of
strong policing and military forces, war serves to alienate the private
violence of the citizens and place their collective aggressive energies
into the hands of the cephalus. War serves the collective illusion of
eternality.]{.underline} [War]{.underline} serves other crucial
functions in the state: it [confirms the values, virtues, and meanings
of one's own cultural group. Sacred symbols]{.underline}---flags,
national anthems, tales of past heroes, fallen ancestors---[are put to
work in luring the best of the nation]{.underline}---its strong and
courageous youths---to [the extreme patriotism required to maintain
order in fascist regimes.]{.underline} The seduction of the nation's
best to its wars includes their provision of an international stage to
display the collective prowess of the nation, a point of pride for all
citizens, even the most oppressed of the society, and it allows for the
individual display of the soldiers' manly character---the valor, the
selflessness, the loyalty. [The wars of modern super-states continue in
the tradition of imperialist projects of old.]{.underline} Posited as
serving the most selfless values---the advancement of freedom,
democracy, and the spread of civilization---**[[today's wars clearly
bring]{.mark} too [massive]{.mark} a booty to be named [selfless]{.mark}
[expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, [**[for]{.mark} the past
[fifty years, wars have]{.mark} increasingly [become shameless lootings
of helpless peoples]{.mark}---the projects of [economists]{.mark} and
accountants and big businessmen [purified by political
propaganda]{.mark} and [backed by an arsenal of modern
tech]{.mark}no-weaponry.** War serves the needs of the cephalus; [it
serves]{.mark} the [personal narcissism]{.mark} of the leaders, and the
collective narcissism of the combatants and civilians.]{.underline}
Above all, **[[modern wars serve]{.mark} [economic goals]{.mark}; their
booty is prodigious.]{.underline}** They may cost the sacred love-object
(the nation) massive capital, human and monetary, but the generals, [the
political leaders, and their corporate cronies profit handsomely from
the hostilities]{.underline}. **[[War]{.mark} also [serves the fantasy
that]{.mark} the sacred love-object ([the nation]{.mark}) [is the
savior]{.mark} and benefactor of the globe; [war serves the
paranoid]{.mark} collective [delusion that the cephalus is
infallible]{.mark} and indestructible, unlimited as the god in its
strength and in its moral substance.]{.underline}** [Killing the
enemies, propagandized as evil, the collective illusion is fed that evil
is overthrown]{.underline}: thus the sanctity of the loveobject is
preserved. **[[Sacred values are recomposed]{.mark}; the cephalus stands
taller, more erect, more firm than ever in the wake of a good
war]{.underline}**. But for all the benefits served by the institution
of war, [**[modern wars are]{.mark} deeply [tragic]{.mark};
[they]{.mark} do waste millions of innocent lives; they tear apart
societies and disburse homeless families across the globe. One in nine
of the earth's seven billion now lives a miserable, wandering, hopeless
existence on parched lands where even the earth mother is
barren**.]{.underline} 44 WENDY C. HAMBLET **[Ultimately the greatest
tragedy of modern war lies in its stark utility to the few at the
extreme expenditure of its many. [The utility of war defeats]{.mark} the
purposes of [war by frustrating the]{.mark} [deepest needs of the
society]{.mark}---[the people's need to build]{.mark} heartfelt
[communities]{.mark}, [a need that can only be served by]{.mark}
[expressing]{.mark} the [collective aggressive]{.mark} [energies of the
society beyond utility]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Bataille states that:
["Since \[war\] is essentially constituted by armed force, it can give
to those who submit to its force of attraction nothing that satisfies
the great human hungers, because it subordinates **everything to a
particular utility** \... it must force its half-seduced lovers to enter
the inhuman and totally alienated world of barracks, military prisons,
and military administrations."]{.underline} In fact, **[[it may well be
the non-release of ecstatic urges that explains a state's return, year
after year and decade after decade, to that old
institution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It may be that [**[the deepest
paradox of modern war is that, in its usefulness to the cephalus and in
its service to the fascist drives of the state, war proves utterly
useless in dispensing its most fundamental function; it ceases to
discharge the most vicious and cruel needs of the people, their deepest
primitive motivations, whose collective release makes possible the
formation of a heartfelt community]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Bataille
counts this failure as the most tragic of the multiple tragedies of
modern war. **[The sacred values of community---life, freedom, festival,
and the joy of communal fraternity---are rendered meaningful only in
juxtaposition to their opposites.]{.underline}** Bataille states:
**["The emotional element that gives an obsessive value to communal life
is death."]{.underline}** But, ultimately, insists Bataille, the
sacrifice will be celebrated beyond the reasonable purposes of the
cephalus. If Bataille is correct, then **[we can be certain that, for
those states whose wars are utterly utilitarian, self-annihilation is
imminent.]{.underline}**

#### Rather than thinking of violence as something external to, or apart from, the thinking-subject, we must recognize violence as an irreducible condition of subjectivity. Only in this way can we come to terms with the traumatic conditions of subjectification and thereby transvalue violence into an overcoming of distinctions between subjects and objects, the self and others.

and Transcendent Violence" Bulletin de la Societe Amencaine de

In the archaic world of paganism, immanence acquires a sacred and divine
character as soon as [the profane world of work and action begins to
separate itself from the intimacy of all beings]{.underline}. In
describing that moment, **[[Bataille qualifies immanence explictly as
\"continuous,\" \"impersonal\" and \"without distinction,\" and
qualifies intimacy as \"profound subjectivity]{.mark}\"]{.underline}**
(TR 301/33). In The Accursed Share, he interprets [**[that ground in
terms of the dynamic and fluid life energy that is always in
excess]{.underline}**. **[Life is always already excessive because every
living organism receives more energy from the cosmos than the amount
sufficient for its self-preservation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In contrast
to the limited problems of classical economy, \"in the general problem
there always reappears [the essence of the biomass]{.underline}, which
[must constantly destroy (consume) a surplus of energy]{.underline}.\"2
**[[Immanence]{.underline}]{.mark}** can never be articulated in terms
of the opposition between subject and object, which characterizes
experience in the profane world of work, action and project. 30 BATAILLE
ON VIOLENCE However, it **[[is the place of a deep subjectivity, a
confused, non-reflective consciousness of the self that is not limited
by the I or other I\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** (fR 300/31). I believe
that [Bataille is a radical thinker of subjectivity]{.underline}, and
his attempt to go beyond the classical notion of the subject can be
related to Merleau-Ponty\'s thinking of subjectivity as incarnated in
The Phenomenology of Perception. 3What Merleau Ponty calls \"the
ante-predicative life of consciousness\" or \"the silence of primary
consciousness\" is the natural perceptive involvement of incarnated
existence with the world. 4 In that involvement, the relation with the
other is not based on absolute separation, but on the fact that [bodily
operative intentions read, understand, constantly connect, and
affectively communicate with each other]{.underline}. Merleau-Ponty
writes that [operative intentionality \"produces the natural and
ante-predicative unity of the world and of our life\"; it furnishes
\"the text which our knowledge tries to translate into precise
language.]{.underline}\"s For both Merleau-Ponty and Bataille,
[[**subjectivity as the immanent unity of the world and life can never
become the object of knowledge, although it can be \"experienced.\"**
Such an experience, which implies the loss of a subject as clear
consciousness of objects is]{.mark}, in Bataille\'s economical terms,
nothing but [an unlimited expenditure of energy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Bataille thinks that [the subject, as an individual and separate being,
belongs to transcendence, for it has always already transcended the
natural environment and is in a position to know objects from the
outside]{.underline}. [**[Knowledge is a possibility of transcendence,
going outside of oneself to an impenetrable
other]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Moreover, [that transcendence is related
to violence not only because representation is violent but also because
the subject in the world of work is subordinated and
servile.]{.underline} **[[The violence to which animals are exposed in
nature is very different than the violence to which we are exposed, and
which reproduces us in the world of work as knowing, acting, speaking
subjects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [In the technological era, man lives
under the domination of anonymous powers and experiences.]{.underline}
He is [subject to both oppression and the empty promises of
transcendence]{.underline}. According to Bataille, [**[the deep truth of
subjectivity is never revealed by transcendence]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
[Although]{.underline} he believes that the expenditure [of the forces
of the body]{.underline}-for example, [erotic experience and
laughter-may open a way for the realm of immanence in which we
re-establish our continuity with all living and non-living
being]{.underline}s, this feeling of continuity is for him nothing n10re
than abrief touching of the untouchable. The fact that he talks about
\"**[[the lost intimacy\" in our bein]{.mark}g]{.underline}** even in
the context of his historical discourse on the displacement of the
borders between the sacred and the profane in successive historical
worlds may give rise to [the impression]{.underline} that [Bataille is
giving expression to a desire to go back]{.underline} to our archaie,
immediate animal existence by transgressing our subjectivist and
objectivist modern cultures. That way of reading Bataille can make his
thought look like some sort of metaphysical nostalgia. However, this
interpretation [becomes suspect if we emphasize that the loss here [is
not the absence of something that was previously present, but the
absence of something that is still present in our lived
experience]{.mark}-even though it is erased, forgotten, and constantly
ignored by the ways in which we schematize our experience]{.underline}.
**[[Our lost intimacy with other living
beings]{.underline}]{.mark}**-from which immanent violence is never
missing-**[[is animal as well as divine, life as much as
death.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Perhaps we **[[need to treat \"immanent
violence\" as an ontological concept that may call for interpretation on
the basis of an ontology of life.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Obviously,
[this constitutes the ontological foundation of Bataille\'s further
distinction between interior and exterior violence]{.underline}, in
terms of which he reads destruction in societies. **[The distinction
between immanent and transcendent violence I find in Bataille has an
explanatory value as an analytical tool]{.underline}**. At the final
analysis, [it will be]{.underline} especially useful in understanding
[why Bataille refrains from condemning violence in purely ethical or
political terms.]{.underline} How does Bataille draw the species barrier
between non-human animals and human animals? He believes, with
Nietzsche, that the world of things, inclividuals, work, utility and
action transcends immanent life. In a sense, only when we were not yet
\"human\" were we completely immanent to nature. In Theory of Religion,
he conceives oE non-human animality in terms oE \"immanence\" and
\"immecliacy\" (TR 291/17). The emphasis on \"immecliacy\" marks a liEe
limited to the realm oE the sensible. A non-human animal is deprived of
universal concepts and ideas that serve as schemes for constructing a
world out of life. Immanence is determined by an inability to overcome
the environment in which a living being spends its life. Transcendence
is the overcoming oE the sensible toward the cancept that Erames nature,
whereas immanence is being imprisoned in the environing sensible
element. We should note that this use oE the couple
\"transcendence-immanence\" singles out man among other species as a
builder oE the world, failing to emphasize that as humans we inhabit the
earth along with other species. The definition oE man as a \"thinking
animaI\" immecliately gives way to a discourse articulating what
thinking may mean as a specific diEEerence, and usually not to what we
may share with other animal species. But Eor Bataille, what is leEt
unthought in this definition is precisely our being inside animality as
weIl as outside it. As an animal species on earth, we have ventured
outside the immanent continuity oE being by a movement oE transcendence.
[Because our intelligence originates in an interruption of immanence, it
is bound to remain ignorant of its source. Intellegence can never return
to immanence without losing itself in it,]{.underline} and in the realm
of transcendence it Eails ta attain consciousness of the fact that the
kernel of Ollr being still belangs to immanence. Nevertheless, Bataille
does not merely affirm that we can swim upstream, against intelligence,
using intelligence against itself to create an opportunity to find an
exit to a conscious experience of the internal relation of all living
beings. [**[Only the violence which I exert, or to which I am exposed,
can tear apart the constructed structures of the world of subjects and
objects in which life is suffocated, and can give us access to sovereign
experiences of immanence]{.mark}.** Selfconsciousness]{.underline} in
Bataille\'s sense, [which is not-knowing, is only possible through such
experiences.]{.underline} [Intelligence is bound to remain foreign to
the life that gave rise to it: it can only enframe, intervene and know
nature from the outside; it will always fail to communicate with life
from within.]{.underline} However, **[[mental life consists not only of
rational thinking. The immanent flow of our incarnated consciousness,
which is essentially an internal relation of communication with others
in unceasing differentiation, is not constituted or controlled by a
knowing subject.]{.underline}]{.mark}** By \"incarnated existence,\" [we
here need to understand impersonal existence, the way in which life
communicates with itself**. [We gain access to that immanence and
experience it only through the interruption of the world of utility and
work, and the dissolution of the individuality that makes possible the
overcoming of the separation of beings from each
other]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In our contact with the elements, in
nutrition, in the satisfaction of our needs, in desire and erotic
experience, we take part in the rhythm of communication of life with
itself, even though cultural forces persuade us to control that contact
with animal existence within us to tame it and forget it. \"Immanence\"
for Bataille does not mean immanence to an object or a subject but to a
total Being or \"One.\" An animal\'s lack of access to transcendence
does not imply that it is a being closed in its inner world, for it does
not have an inner world in which to enclose itself. Animal is immanent
to the environment in which it lives and does not have the capacity to
transcend it. But how is this milieu, this \"One\", described? Bataille
depicts it by invoking the type of certainty that manifests itself
\"when an animal eats another one\" (TR 291/1 7). When an animal eats
another one, the meaning of the situation in which the former finds
itself is clearly similar to that of the latter. The similarity between
the meanings of those two situations cannot be found in the sensations
that the animals have, for one is being torn to pieces by the other.
Nevertheless, both animals are immanent to one and the same medium,
which does not make the one who is active in eating \"transcendent\"
with respect to the other who is eaten. In some kinds of animals, during
the period of copulation males fight for females and those males who
prove to be stronger chase away the others. **[[There is a difference
between the victorious animal and the defeated one. However the victory,
if it is not by chance, proves nothing else than a quantitative
difference of strength]{.underline}]{.mark}** (TR 292/18). The
establishment of such a difference does not make the victorious male
transcend the others. **[[The acts of killing, winning, and copulating
give rise to a feeling of \"transcendence\" only in the human
world]{.mark}, due to the \"objectification\" of the other as
passive.]{.underline}** [In opposition to the immanent violence in
nature, violence is seen as a mark of transcendence in the human
world]{.underline}. It bears in itself the promise of elevating man to
God, enabling him to incorporate an image of Him. Revealed religions
bal\~ homicide and human sacrifice. In the Muslim religion, to take away
someone\'s life, given to him/her by God, is to transgress the limits of
the realm in which human beings can legitimately use their power. [To
kill someone is to usurp God\'s authority over life and death and thus
to set one\'s self as an equal to God. This is why]{.underline} **[only
wars fought in the name of God can legitimate the killing of human
beings]{.underline}**. [The idea that, in killing, the murderer
substitutes himself for God, bears in itself the implicit tendency to
trunk that violence can deify a human being. Physically abusive
husbands, parents, torturers and rapists take themselves to be
transcending their victims.]{.underline} **[[This sense of transcendence
is accompanied by a pleasure stemming from their perception of physical
superiority as constituting an ontological, epistemological, and even a
moral difference]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In Theory of Religion, Bataille
writes, \"[[The lion is not the king of the animals. In the movement of
waters, he is only a higher tide that can reverse the weaker ones. That
an animal eats another does not change a fundamental situation: every
animal is in the world like water in water\']{.underline}]{.mark} (fR
292/18-19).6 [By contrast, man is not in the world like water in
water]{.underline}. Even [a]{.underline} superficial [glimpse of
\"social status\" in the human world will show that factors such as
\"education,\" \"gender,\" \"ethnicity,\" \"race,\" and \"class\"
intersect to constitute quite incomparable situations. **[The power of
transcendence in the world of work, utility and action rests on
situational differences, and the subject who assumes a
status]{.mark}**]{.underline} that such crisscrossing of differences may
assign to it pays for this by losing his/her own sovereign selE7 **[[To
the genealogy of the transcendence of the subject belong the experiences
of fear, submission, guilt, self-contempt, self-hatred, imitation of the
desire of the other, and the illusion of self-sufficiency,
self-coincidence and independence.]{.mark} [Being before the law and
entering it, the fundamental experience of the symbolic order is a
trauma]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In the world of work, in order to
become a subject, one needs to sacrifice one\'s self in the face of
power, repress one\'s immediate desires, reconcile oneself with the
authority, accept being rewarded and punished by it and delay free
self-expression until one has nothing left to
express]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Bataille seeks ways of transgressing
the limits of a life of submission to the world of power
relations]{.underline}, but he is skeptical about the \"warrior of
freedom\" as well. Both the submissive self and the revolutionary self
become subjects by being exposed to transcendent violence, and they are
produced by their opposite reactions to it. Oppressive systems of power
do change by sacrificing or marginalizing those who fight for freedom,
yet their challenge and resistance open the path of communication for
those who keep silent out of fear of persecution as surrogate victims.
Freedom fighters become surrogate victims. However, it is also true
that, even when they cannot make a difference that directly changes the
oppressive systems, they open the way for the discourse that paves the
way for transformation. The fighter for freedom may be saving the
dignity of the environment, but helshe cannot attain his/her self
consciousness in so far as helshe is committed to action and work for
the common utility. An interior outlet to immanence is neither possible
for those who wait for their turn to be in charge of power nor for the
marginalized revolutionary. In short, [struggle for power, no matter
what the consequences are, takes one away from the direction of the
immanence in which Bataille sees \"the sovereign good\" and the ultimate
possibility of our existence]{.underline}. [**[Neither submission to law
and authority nor revolt may lead to immanence.]{.underline}**
**[Occupying a position of power within a system licenses the subject to
use violence]{.underline}**. **[The feeling of transcendence experienced
as the possessor of that power is in fact illusory, for the truth is
that one is temporarily possessed by that power]{.underline}**.
**[Because one is only the surrogate subject, the transient host of
power, the truth of the appearance of subjective potency is nothing but
impotence]{.underline}**. **[Immanent violence targets this illusory
sense of transcendence]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** For
example, Fight Club, one of the cult movies of recent years, lends
itself to being read in terms of the question of the unleashing of
immanent violence against the nluch greater violence errlbedded in a
society organized by advanced capitalist relations of production. 8 The
anti-heros of this movie exert immanent violence to destroy the ways in
which life is possessed by the desire to possess. They find relief in a
play of violence among friends which makes winning and losing
insignificant and yet their immanent violence risks being lost in
revolutionary terrorism. Fight Club seems to begin in Bataillean fashion
as a \"project against the project\" and ends up as a struggle to
prevent the other\'s death to which it leads. This struggle is not the
result of a conflict between the return to immanence and morality or
religion. It is a struggle between transcendent and immanent violence.
The argument that a living being\'s life can be sacrificed for higher
ends is a mark of transcendent violence, for there are no such ends in
immanence. Of course, this is not to say that immanence has no risk or
no danger. [A plane of immanence on which no concern for transcendence
can have a hold manifests itself with an unthinkable power to
emancipate.]{.underline} A globalizing world promises no history that
would make mankind even more transcendent. **[Technology tolerates only
the accumulation of information which supplies no critical
resources]{.underline}**. Given this present state of affairs, violence
seems to have already lost the promise of transcendence. However, one
may ask about the victims of immanent violence too. For example, what
about the pornographic snuff movies which cause the deaths of thousands
of women in the world? Would that be a phenomenon of immanent violence?
Let us turn to Theory of Religion before we speculate about how Bataille
might answer that question. [The violence that makes transcendence
possible presupposes an act of objectification.]{.underline} **[[Unlike
human consciousness which distinguishes itself from its objects, an
eagle that attacks a lamb does not distinguish it from
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An object is by definition that which is
thrown in front of an onlooker, and thus something I can set up over
against myself. Unlike the hammer I use or the other whose hand I hold,
an object can never be an extension of my living body. The eagle does
not perceive the lamb as an object. Animals do not have an \"outside
world\" that consists of objects. Given that objects are temporal
syntheses, and presupposing with Bataille that the dimension of future
that marks intelligence is not open to animals, an animal cannot see its
prey as an object. According to Bataille, [the eating of one animal by
another is consumption, an extermination that has no duration and occurs
in an actual time in which nothing is objectified]{.underline}. 9
Neither can we say that an animal that eats another one is using it. The
eagle is immersed in the nutritive \"element\" in the act of emptying
the intestines of the other that it lays open. [In contrast to the
relation with an object, the immanent relation with the other does not
involve a separation, a distinction between me and the
other]{.underline}. **[According to Bataille such an internal relation
with the other has no duration, that is, it is always in the present.
This is not to say that it is closed to the future. However, the future
here is not the time of projects but a time that can never be
anticipated.]{.underline}** When Bataille writes that \"[**[intimacy is
violence,]{.underline}**\"]{.mark} [we should perhaps understand
this]{.underline} in terms of the fragilities of inter-corporeality as
much [as the exposure by the present to a future that is to come,
without any possibility of anticipation.]{.underline} Bataille
emphasizes that **[duration belongs to the world of
objects.]{.underline}** [Objects are spatial and temporal
syntheses]{.underline}. It is important to ren1ember that Merleau-Ponty
explains the illusion of transcendence by taking his departure precisely
from that synthetic nature of perception. As is well-known, for
Merleau-Ponty an object that appears in its thickness is spatial as well
as temporal, and is never given to my perception from all the points of
view at once. 10 That the gaze is always bound to a certain perspective
implies that the object will always absolutely be partially closed.
**[Our classic and ordinary fiction of an \"object\" owes its being
to]{.underline}** the attribution of the primacy of vision over all the
other senses, and to **[the presupposition that there can be an
all-encompassing gaze.]{.underline}** In Merleau-Ponty\'s terms, [this
illusion rests on our forgetting the role played by the spatiality of
the living body in vision.]{.underline} We may say that [our
tendency,]{.underline} in our imagination, **[to separate the gaze from
the living body to which it belongs is one of the conditions of
transcendence that can make even the world itself an
object]{.underline}**. \"It is the ex-stase of perception which causes
all perception to be perception of something.\"ll [When we conceive the
world as a big object, we forget that we inhabit the earth with our
fellow creatures]{.underline}. Now, **[[immanent violence is an attempt
to overcome the separation between the I and the other that gave rise to
subjects and objects. If, in the age of technology, one can talk about
violence on a plane of immanence which does not bring about or reproduce
transcendence by becoming internal to the subject, history, God, and so
on, then such violence may attest to the experience of the living body
through pain, or through an experience of remembering that
heals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The violence that results in transcendence
objectifies-the female body killed by snuff is set on the screen as the
ultimate object in which life is destroyed. On the other hand, in the
lived experience of immanent violence, the desire is to destroy the
object that is the human body, the human body as an object. [Bataille
knows well that our civilization treats the female body as an object of
a male gaze; however, erotic experience as a sovereign experience cannot
have anything to do with objectification, except to overcome
it]{.underline}. In so far as the erotic is a touching of lost intimacy,
it is the [dissolution of both object and subject]{.underline}

### **[Achievement]{.underline}** 

#### The 1AC's presentation of a more "educated" and "better" world order post the plan falls in line with the necropoltiical desire for ordering and consumption. This works under the myth of Narissus, where the 1AC would prefer to watch a puddle showing their own reflection of grandeur and achievement rather than the outside world of their domination and imposition of will. This works not only through educational achievement and the desire to be the best but also through a desire for even the over-spectacularization of death itself.

**Mbembe'01 --** Achille Mbembe -- Professor Achille Mbembe, born in
Cameroon, obtained his Ph.D in History at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1989
and a D.E.A. in Political Science at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques
(Paris). He was Assistant Professor of History at Columbia University,
New York, from 1988-1991, a Senior Research Fellow at the Brookings
Institute in Washington, D.C., from 1991 to 1992, Associate Professor of
History at the University of Pennsylvania from 1992 to 1996, Executive
Director of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research
in Africa (Codesria) in Dakar, Senegal, from 1996 to 2000. Achille was
also a visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in
2001, and a visiting Professor at Yale University in 2003. He has
written extensively in African history and politics, including La
naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun (Paris, Karthala, 1996). On the
Postcolony was published in Paris in 2000 in French and the English
translation was published by the University of California Press,
Berkeley, in 2001. In 2015, Wits University Press published a new,
African edition. He has an A1 rating from the National Research
Foundation. -- "On the Postcolony" pg 130-133- KZaidi

Such attention to detail should not come as a surprise; it is part of
the system of "distinction."98 The [enumeration of the slightest
educational achievement is one of the postcolonial codes of
prestige,]{.underline} with [special attention to distinctions attained
in Europe]{.underline}. Thus, for example, [citizens cite their diplomas
with great care, they show off their titles---doctor, chief, president,
and so on---with great affectation, as a way of claim- ing honor, glory,
attention. Displays of this kind have an effect beyond their
contribution to state ritual. Such a display is
transformative]{.underline}; by casting its rays on the person
installed, it bestows upon him a new ra- diance. In the hierarchy of
mock honors, the [description of scholarly achievements constitutes a
marker of rank and status as well as of qualification.99]{.underline}

Another [example of "distinction" is the ceremony where decorations and
medals are awarded.]{.underline} During the 20 May 1989 ceremonies
alone, more than 3,000 people were decorated with 481 gold medals, 1,000
dark red medals, and 1,682 silver medals. [The medals]{.underline},
obtained from the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, cos[t CFA 11,500
each for the gold, CFA 10,500 for the dark red, and CFA 8,500 for the
silver vari- eties. Additionally, businesses gave "contributions" to the
recipients to help with family festivities.100 These family celebrations
included "liba- tions, feasting and various extravagances \[which\] are
the norm in such circumstances."101 One could indeed be disturbed by the
lavishness of the expenditure]{.underline}, since it is rare to find a
recipient of a medal who is not heavily in debt after the celebrations,
but the primary point is that, in this context, [the granting of a medal
is a political act through which bu- reaucratic relations are
transformed into clientelist networks where pleasures, privileges, and
resources are distributed for political compli- ance.102 The lavish
distribution of food and other marks of generosity are of interest only
to the extent that they make relations of superiority manifest; what
circulates are not just gifts but tokens creating networks of
indebtedness and subordination.103]{.underline}

The day they told me that I was to be decorated, my wife and I were so
ex- cited that we stayed up all night talking about the event. Until
then we had only taken part in celebrations when others had been
decorated. This time we would be celebrating our own medal . . . On the
day I received the medal my wife had prepared a pretty bouquet of
flowers which she presented to me on the ceremonial stand to the sound
of public applause.104

[In the postcolony, magnificence and the desire to shine are not the
pre- rogative only of those who command. The people also want to be
"hon- ored," to "shine," and to take part in celebrations.]{.underline}

Last Saturday the Muslim community of Cameroon celebrated the end of Ra-
madan. For thirty days members of the community had been deprived of
many things from dawn till dusk. They refrained from drinking, eating,
smoking, sexual relations and saying anything that goes against the
Muslim faith and the law. Last Saturday marked the end of these
privations for the whole Mus- lim community of Cameroon.105

It is clear that the [obscenity of power in the postcolony is also fed
by a desire for majesty on the part of the people]{.underline}. Because
the [postcolony is characterized above all by scarcity, the metaphor of
food "lends itself to the wide-angle lens of both imagery and
efficacy]{.underline}."106 [Food and tips]{.underline} (pour- boire)
[are political]{.underline},107 "[food," like "scarcity," cannot be
dissociated from particular regimes of "death," from specific modalities
of enjoyment or from therapeutic quests]{.underline}.108 This is why
"[the night"109 and "witch- craft,"110 the "invisible,"111 the "belly,"
the "mouth,"112 and the "penis" are historical phenomena in their own
right. They are institutions and sites of power, in the same way as
pleasure or fashion:]{.underline}

Cameroonians love slick gaberdine suits, Christian Dior outfits,
Yamamoto blouses, shoes of crocodile skin . . . .113

The [label is the true sign of "class." . . . There are certain names
that stand out. They are the ones that should be worn on a jacket, a
shirt, a skirt, a scarf, or a pair of shoes if you want to win
respect.114]{.underline}

[Do not be surprised if one day when you enter an office unannounced you
discover piles of clothing on the desks]{.underline}. The hallways of
Ministries and other public or private offices have become the market
place par excellence. [Market conditions are so flexible that
everyone---from the director to the messenger--- finds what they want.
Indeed, owing to the current crisis, sellers give big re- ductions and
offer long-term credit]{.underline} . . . .

[Business is so good that many people throw themselves into it head
down]{.underline}. A veritable waterhole, it's where sophisticated
ladies rub shoulders with all kinds of ruffians and layabouts. The
[basis of the entire "network" is travel.]{.underline} It is no secret
that most of the clothes on the market come from the West. Those who
have the "chance" to go there regularly are quick to notice that they
can reap great benefits from frequent trips. A few "agreements" made
with customs officials, and the game is on.115

[Even death does not escape this desire to "shine" and to be "honored."
The rulers and the ruled want more than ceremonies and celebrations to
show off their splendor]{.underline}. Those who have accumulated goods,
prestige, and influence are not only tied to the "constraints of
giving."116 They are also [taken by the desire to "die well" and to be
buried with pomp.]{.underline}117 Funerals constitute one of the
occasions where those who [command gaze at themselves, much like
Narcissus.]{.underline}118 Thus, when Joseph Awunti, the presidential
minister in charge of relations with parliament, died on 4 November
1987, his body was received at Bamenda airport by the gov- ernor of what
was then the Northwestern Province, Wabon Ntuba Mboe, himself
accompanied by the Grand Chancellor, the first vice-president of the
party, and a variety of administrative, political, and "traditional" au-
thorities. Several personalities and members of the government were also
present, including the "personal" representative of the head of state,
Joseph Charles Dumba, Minister to the Presidency. The Economic and
Social Council was represented by its president, Ayang Luc, the National
Assembly by the president of the parliamentary group, and the Central
Committee of the Party by its treasurer.119 [Power's sanction thus pene-
trated to the very manner the dead man was buried. It appears that those
who command seek to familiarize themselves with death, paving the way
for their burial to take on a certain quality of pleasure and
expenditure.]{.underline}

During the funeral of Thomas Ebongalame, former Secretary of the
National Assembly, Member of the Upper Council of the Magistracy, Ad-
ministrative Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, board mem-
ber of many parastatals, and "[initiated member of the secret society of
his tribe," the procession left Yaoundé by road. Huge crowds had come
from throughout Southwestern Province to pay their last
respects.]{.underline}

At Muyuka, Ebonji, Tombel, and Nyasoso, [primary and secondary school
students formed human hedges several hundred metres long. When the body
arrived in Kumba, the main town of Meme, the entire place turned itself
into a procession]{.underline}. At the head was the ENI--ENIA fanfare
playing a mournful tune. [People wept profusely. . . . In this town with
a population of over 120,000 all socio-economic activity had been put on
ice since 30 April, when the tragic news was heard. People awaited
instructions from Yaoundé. No fewer than ten meetings were held to
organise the funeral programme.]{.underline}120

As we have seen, [obscenity---regarded as more than a moral category---
constitutes one modality of power in the postcolony. But it is also one
of the arenas in which subordinates reaffirm or subvert that
power.]{.underline} Bakhtin's error was to attribute these practices to
the dominated. But the [production of burlesque is not specific to this
group]{.underline}. The real inversion takes place when, in their desire
for a certain majesty, the [masses join in the madness and clothe
themselves in cheap imitations of power to re- produce its
epistemology,]{.underline} and when power, in its own vi[olent quest for
grandeur, makes vulgarity and wrongdoing its main mode of existence. It
is here, within the confines of this intimacy, that the forces of
tyranny in Africa must be studied]{.underline}. Such [research must go
beyond institutions]{.underline}, be- yond formal positions of power,
[and beyond the written rules, and ex- amine how the implicit and
explicit are interwoven, and how the prac- tices of those who command
and those who are assumed to obey are so entangled as to render both
powerless. For it is precisely the situations of powerlessness that are
the situations of violence par excellence.]{.underline}

### Anti-Blackness

#### The real Other is the white man who dismembers the black man -- the 1AC actor is absolved of responsibility by the "code of honor," a privilege afforded by a sadistic Will-to-Enjoy -- instead, we must contemplate the unknowable power of violence without cowardly fear nor sadistic fascination

**Stabler 2016** (Albert, PhD student in Art Education at the University
of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and Chicago Public Schools Teacher**.**
"Punishment in Effigy: An aesthetics of torment versus a pedagogy of
pain in Georges Bataille and Eric Garner." *Photographies*. 9:3,
322-323, accessed 7/10/17, EHL)

[The only thing protecting us from this gaze is accumulated imagery, the
misperceptions which form our subjectivity, the shadow of ourselves that
blocks the light; Lacan calls this the "screen]{.underline}." "\[I\]f I
am anything in the picture," he says, "it is always in the form of the
screen, which I earlier called the stain, the spot" (97). **[Racism is
anchored in these unconscious images]{.underline}**. "When one has
grasped the mechanism described by Lacan," says Frantz Fanon, "[one can
have no further doubt that **the real Other for the white man is** and
will continue to be **the black man**]{.underline}. And conversely.
[Only for the white man The Other is perceived on the level of the body
image, absolutely as the not-self--- that is, the unidentifiable, the
unassimilable.]{.underline}" (161) Fanon here identifies the black man
with this distorted image, this "stain" itself. And for Fanon, this
psychological fact is, as seen with the sentence of sedition shared by
Sade, Roman slaves, and Chinese prisoners, a political fact. [For many a
white American, Deleuze and Guattari's Euro-Christian "faciality
machine" could represent this protective screen, while Garner's
eyes]{.underline}, disinterred from Emmanuel Levinas' unassimilable
"face of the Other," [might haunt whites like the "evil eye" that does
not reside in but stares through the image.]{.underline} "The evil eye
is the fascinum (spell)," Lacan says, "it is that which has the effect
of arresting movement and, literally, of killing life . . . It is
precisely one of the dimensions in which the power of the gaze is
exercised directly" (Lacan Four Fundamental Concepts 118). But
"[dismantling" the face]{.underline} for Deleuze and Guattari is itself
blissful; it [means to "no longer look into the eyes,]{.underline} but
to swim through them, [to close your eyes, to close your own eyes, and
make your body a beam of light moving at ever-increasing
speed"]{.underline} (187). JR's rendering of Garner's eyes, more [than a
tuxedo-clad high school photo of Garner that was widely shared, or even
the unforgettable image from Orta's video of his dying moments on the
sidewalk under a pile of white police officers, carry a hint of what
Joseph Lo Duca called, in ecstatic italics, "the last
instant"]{.underline} (6). As [Bataille illustrates through his sensual
reflections on dismemberment, **the use of force has a sublime
dimension**]{.underline}. What responsibility does this voyeuristic
rapture entail? [Ultimately, Lacan sees]{.underline} [the perverse Sade
both as a teacher and a victim of the law]{.underline}--- as does
Bataille, as does Sade himself. Sade is reminiscent of the snake that
D.H. Lawrence takes pity on, describing it as "like a king in exile," as
well as the snake that Jacques Derrida describes as the true victim in
Eden, another pedagogical "Garden of the Laws" (79--80). [Sade's
purportedly uninhibited pleasure-seeking, what Bataille calls his
"**sovereignty**" and what Lacan refers to as his "**Will-to-Enjoy**,"
is merely obedience disguised as a fantasy that]{.underline}, according
to Slavoj Žižek[, has come to characterize the ideology of capitalist
ethics]{.underline}. The imaginary "discourse of mastery" that Lacan
identifies in [Sade's writing can be recognized as a perverse reaction
to a yet more perverse Law that pursued and constrained Sade throughout
his lifetime]{.underline}, and whose brutal excesses authored his
fanciful inventions--- inventions which, in turn, created a precedent
for the detached bliss Bataille recorded upon viewing the mangled corpse
and beatific countenance of a Chinese prisoner. [Žižek pictures Sade as
"an object upon which state agencies lived out their moralistic sadism."
"The real Will-to-Enjoy," he elaborates, "is in the state bureaucratic
apparatus which handles the subject" as well as in the pleasurable
excesses of punishment tolerated by state authorities as a brutal form
of education]{.underline} (36). Where we might think of a killer cop,
Žižek calls to mind a typical Southern small town of the 1920s, in which
"the official public Law \... is accompanied by the lynchings of
powerless blacks." Žižek continues, "[**A white man is easily forgiven**
at least minor infringements of the Law, especially **when they can be
justified by a 'code of honor'**" (37). In the case of many police
officers, this sovereign "code" entails absolute authority over
faceless, stateless black bodie]{.underline}s. Like Bataille, [white
viewers can take pleasure in viewing the misery of others by identifying
with an omniscient gaze that Lacan termed, "**the big
Other**."]{.underline} Through this gaze, be it that of a smart phone or
dashboard camera, [whites imagine ourselves inflicting pain on those we
consider criminal and less than human, while also experien- cing that
pain as euphoria, seeing our spectatorship reflected back to us through
witnesses]{.underline}. It is then not enough to pedagogically demand
visibility and punishment, since [punishment and vision are already
bound up with pleasure]{.underline}. [Bataille says of the Chinese
convict's face, "it was precisely that which I was seeking, not so as to
take pleasure in it, but to ruin in me that which is opposed to
him."]{.underline} In the empathy and solidarity Bataille expresses, on
behalf of the Marquis de Sade as well as himself, **[the witnessing of
horror can produce revolutionary impulses.]{.underline}** **[Our first
task when faced by a scene of violence is to be overcome by neither fear
nor fascination, but to contemplate the unknowable power located in the
gaze beyond the image.]{.underline}**

### Arms Sales Reduction

**Arms sales are an instance of weaponized excess to increase the Global
power regime of the US -- the plan is not a negative state action but
rather it replicates the same charity used to behind the gates
foundation -- cleansing the slave mining in the congo -- not part of the
peace process but a covert expansion of political capital and control --
we should say fuck it and do random shit as a glorious expenditure that
refuses to partake in this silly spoondockle.**

**Hutnyk 4** (John Hutnyk, "Bad Marxism" 177-182, 2004)

Have I not led my readers astray? (Bataille 1991:430)Bataille cannot be
left to rot in the library. How useful an experiment would it be to try
to 'apply' Bataille's notion of expenditure to politics today?
Klaus-Peter Köpping asks questions about 'modernity' that arise
explicitly from his reading of Bataille as a theorist of transgression,
addressing political examples such as Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia and
Indonesia (2002:243). [A more extravagant general economy framework for
such questions might take up the massive accumulation that is the excess
of an arms trade promoting regional conflicts as integral to sales
figures on the one side, with the performative futility of massed
anti-capitalism rallies and May Day marches that fall on the nearest
Sunday so as not to disrupt the city on the other]{.underline}.
[Expenditure and squandering today]{.underline}, in Bataille's sense,
might be seen in both the planned obsolescence of cars, computers and
nearly all merchandise, as well as in the waste production and fast-food
service industry cults and fashionista style wars, tamogotchi and
Beckham haircuts that currently sweep the planet[.]{.underline} No doubt
it would be too mechanical to rest with such applications, too
utilitarian, but the relevance is clear. The use-value of Georges
Bataille is somewhat eccentric and the deployment of preSecond World War
circumstances as a comparative register for today is of course merely
speculative. No return to the 1930s (colourise films now). Yet, taking
account of a long list of circumstantial differences -- no Hitler, no
Moscow, no Trotskyite opposition -- is also unnecessary since it is only
in the interests of thinking through the current conjuncture so as to
understand it, and change it, that any return should ever be
contemplated. The importance of French anthropology -- Mauss -- as well
as psychoanalysis and phenomenology, cannot be underestimated and all
are crucial in Bataille's comprehension of the rise of fascism. 177
Hutn_ch12.qxd 5/8/04 10:52 PM Page 177 Can these matters help us to make
sense of political debates in the midst of a new world war today? That
the intellectual currents that shaped Bataille's analysis were
post-Marxist did not, then, replace the importance of Marx. Today the
comprehension of [Bush's planetary terror machine still requires such an
analysis, but one that can also be informed by the reading of Bataille's
thought as shaped by the intellectual currents mentioned above. In a
period of capitalist slump, crisis of credit, overextended market,
defaulted debt and threatening collapse, the strategy of war looms
large.]{.underline} Even before the events of [11 September 2001 in New
York, Bush was clearly on the warpath with missile defence systems,
withdrawal from various international treaties and covenants, and
massive appropriations for military and surveillance
systems.]{.underline} **[The imperialist element is clear and
sustained]{.underline}** -- the aggression against the Palestinians, the
adventure in Afghanistan and the war on Iraq (to defend papa Bush's
legacy) obviously have roots in the imperialist mercantile tradition But
it is a matter of record that, under the Bush family regime, [the
US--Europe alliance has not been interested in pursuing any programme of
reduction of disparity, a few suspensions of Third World debt and UN
summits notwithstanding]{.underline}. When Bataille searches for [an
alternative to war in some 'vast economic competition' through which
costly sacrifices, comparable to war, would yet give the competitor with
initiative the advantage]{.underline} (1949/1988:172), **[he holds out
hope for a kind of gift without return]{.underline}**. That he showed
some enthusiasm for the Marshall Plan after the Second World War as a
possible model for this might need to be ascribed to the exhausted
condition of post-war France, but he soon revised his assessment. [The
Marshall Plan was not as disinterested as Bataille implied; it
facilitated circulation and recoupment of surplus value as profit. The
Cold War and nuclear proliferation turned out to be the preferred
examples of reckless waste in actuality -- as recognised in volume two
of The Accursed Share]{.underline} (Bataille 1991:188). [Today,
redistribution is not considered an option, and -- after the slaughter
of millions -- the threat of Asian communisms]{.underline} (China,
Korea, Vietnam) [can be ignored. The war on Islam (known variously as
the Gulf War, Zionism and the War on Terror) appears now as the primary
strategy]{.underline} (combined with a war on South America, mistakenly
named as a war on drugs, and a war on immigration disguised as a
security concern). **[The secondary strategy is a newly hollowed out
version of liberal welfare]{.underline}**. In 1933 Bataille had written
of **[the bourgeois tendency to declare 'equality' and make it their
watchword, all the time showing they do not share the lot of the
workers]{.underline}** (Bataille 1997:177). In the twenty-first century,
[Prime Minister Blair]{.underline} of England has made some gestures
towards a similar pseudo-alternative. [At a Labour Party congress in the
millennium year he spoke of the need to address poverty and famine in
Africa]{.underline}, [and no doubt in quiet moments still congratulates
himself on his pursuit of this happy agenda]{.underline}; [a little over
a year later]{.underline} a large entourage of delegates and diplomats
flew to Johannesburg for another conference junket -- [the World Summit
on Sustainable Development (for sustainable profit).]{.underline} [The
party accompanying Blair and Deputy Prescott included multinational
mining corporation Rio Tinto Executive Director Sir Richard
Wilson]{.underline} (The Guardian 12 August 2002). [Rio Tinto is hardly
well known for its desire to redistribute the global share of surplus
expenditure for the welfare of all]{.underline}.1 [If there are no
gifts, only competitions of expenditure, what then of the effort of
Bataille to oppose fascism?]{.underline} [It is not altruistic, and yet
it is the most necessary and urgent aspect of his work that is given to
us to read for today]{.underline}. Is **[fascism a charity-type
trick]{.underline}**? [A deceit of double dealing which offers the
illusion of more while giving less]{.underline}? Something like this
psycho-social structure of fascism appears to be enacted in the potlatch
appeasements of the propaganda spinsters surrounding
Blair[.]{.underline} [The New Labour and Third Way public offering is
ostentatiously to be about more health care, more police, more schools,
but Blair spins and rules over a deception that demands allegiance to a
privatisation programme that cares only about reducing the costs (fixed
capital costs) of providing healthy, orderly, trained employees for
industry, of short-term profit and arms sales to Israel, of racist
scare-mongering and scapegoating of asylum seekers, refugees and
migrants, of opportunist short-term gain and head-in-the-sand
business-as-usual]{.underline}. Similarly, the gestures of
[multimillionaires]{.underline} like George Soros and Bill Gates in
establishing charity 'foundations' to [ease their guilt is not just a
matter of philanthropy, it is a necessary gambit of
containment]{.underline} (and these two in particular bringing their
cyber-evangelism to the markets of Eastern Europe, South and South-East
Asia). **[The liberal rhetoric of charity and the militant drums of war
are the two strategies of the same rampant Provocateur restrictive
economy]{.underline}**. [Carrot and stick. Team A and team B of
capitalist hegemony -- the critique of the gift is clear, a gift is not
a gift but a debt of time -- and this is not really generosity or
hospitality]{.underline}. The same can be said perhaps of war -- it is
not war but profit, just as **[the gift reassures the giver of their
superior status, the war on terror unleashes a terror of its own; war
does not produce victories but rather defeat for all]{.underline}**.
Bataille shows us a world in ruins. 11 September 2001 has been made into
the kind of event that transforms an unpopular (even unelected) figure
into a leader under whom the nation coheres in a new unity -- much as
Bataille saw Nuremburg achieve for the National Socialists. Of course I
am not suggesting Bush is a Nazi -- he hasn't got the dress sense -- but
**[people are betrayed by the trick of a 'democracy' that offers
pseudo-participation once every four years, and this time in a way that
has consequences leading inexorably to a massive fight]{.underline}**.
[The kowtowing to big business with a rhetoric of social security has
been heard before]{.underline} -- it was called [the New
Deal]{.underline} (or welfare state) and [was a deception almost from
the start]{.underline}. Where there was perhaps some contractual
obligation of aid in the earlier forms, today the trick of the buy-off
bribery of service provision is contingent and calculated according only
to corporate strategic gain. [While we lurch towards endless war,
governments reassure us with the watchwords of security that really mean
death and despair to those on the wrong side of the wire. The largest
prison population ever]{.underline} (under democracy or any other form
of government), [mass confinement for minor offences (]{.underline}three
strikes[), colour overcoded death row]{.underline} (Mumia Abu-Jamal
etc.),2 [arrest and detention without trial or charge, celebratory
executionism and worse]{.underline}. The incarcerated souls in the
concentration camps of Sangatte,3 Woomera,4 Kamunting5 or Guantanamo6
are wired in and offered up as sacrificial gifts to the rule of new
judicial-administrative fascism. [A toothy-smiling Christian cult of
death and technology, spun carefully via press conferences and TV
sitcoms -- television has given up any pretence of journalism in favour
of infotainment.]{.underline} Does the US administration dream of a new
post-war era where, once again like Marshall, they could come with a
plan to rebuild upon ruins? This would indicate [the exhaustion of the
current mode of production, which, with an 'information' revolution
promised renewal, but was quickly stalled.]{.underline} Whatever the
case, the enclosure of the US and Europe behind fortress walls does not
-- experience now shows -- ensure prophylactic protection, and ruin may
be visited upon all. It was Bataille who said perhaps only the 'methods
of the USSR would ... be equal to a ruined immensity'
(1949/1988:167--8). Polite critiques and protest have no purchase --
orderly rallies against the aggression in Afghanistan, against asylum
and immigration law, against the destruction of Palestine, etc., get no
'airtime' (instead, 'political' soap opera like The West Wing is the
current equivalent in ideological terms to the Cold War's Bomber
Command). Every leader that accedes to [the 'War on Terror' programme
and its excesses (civilian deaths, curtailment of civil liberty, global
bombing) is an appeaser]{.underline}. This is akin to the dithering of
Chamberlain in 1938, only this time the opposition activists are
fighting in a 'post-national' arena and Stalin's slumber will not be
broken, the Red Army cannot run interference, there is no [Churchill
rumbling in the wings, the fascist empire will prevail without militant
mobilisation across the board.]{.underline} This is the appeaser's gift
-- betrayal into the 'ranks assigned to us by generals and industrial
magnates' (Bataille, 1985:164). The unravelling of the [tricks of social
welfare, of 'asylum' and 'aid' programmes, of 'interest'
even]{.underline} (the narrowing of news broadcasts to domestic
affairs), of tolerance, the hypocrisy of prejudice -- [all this prepares
us for a war manufactured elsewhere. After the breakdown of the gift's
tricks, fascism is the strategy, the obverse side of capital's coin. In
this context, the geopolitics that enables, or demands, appeasement of
the imperious corporate/US power is the restricted destruction we should
fear, and we should fight in a struggle that goes beyond national
defence, wage claims or solidarity.]{.underline} The discipline of the
Soviets and of Bataille could be our tools. Bataille reads on in his
library. [We are left speculating with him, rashly charging in with
ideas that a less excessive, less exuberant, moderation might withhold.
But there is no more important time to consider the efforts in the arts
to fight militarism out of control]{.underline}, and, as Bush drags the
world into permanent war, it is worth asking why Bataille's surrealistic
opposition to Hitler was inadequate. Is it because there are no more
thinkers in the party? Is it that subversion is uninformed and its
spirit quiet? Chained to the shelves, it is not enough to know that
appeasement of the military-industrial machine is the obverse side of
liberal charity. Why are we still unable to acknowledge this is the path
to devastation? What would be adequate to move away from appeasement to
containment and more? What kind of sovereign wastage would Bataille
enact today? [Against the 'immense hypocrisy of the world of
accumulation']{.underline} (Bataille 1991:424), the answer is clear: [we
should 'condemn this Provocateur mouldy society to revolutionary
destruction']{.underline} (Bataille 1997:175). The Bataille of La
Critique Sociale might argue [for a glorious expenditure as that which
connects people together in the social and recognises their joint labour
to produce themselves, and this must be redeemed from the restricted
economy that insists on expenditure for the maintenance of hierarchy. If
he were leaving the library today, the Bataille of anti-war Surrealism
might say it is time for a wake-up knock-down critique of the barking
dogs. The castrating lions of appeasement must be hounded out of
town]{.underline}. Back in your kennels, yelping pups of doom. Fair
call, Georges Bataille

### Being

#### Someone dead once said that "there was only one debate to be had, that of being vs becoming". Our argument is that the world is always in a state of becoming -- through the blade of the knife being replaced through the cellular components of our own bodies -- becoming structures the world itself. The 1ac's assumption that there is being in the world is naïve in that it ignores the way that being is nowhere

**Bataille'85.** Georges Bataille. French intellectual and literary
figure working in literature, philosophy, anthropology, economics,
sociology and history of art.\"The labyrinth.\" trans. Allan Stoekl.

\[[Humans\] act in order to be.]{.underline} This must [not]{.underline}
be understood [in the negative sense of conservation]{.underline}
(conserving in order not to be thrown out of existence by death), but
[in the positive sense of a tragic and incessant combat for a
satisfaction that is almost beyond reach.]{.underline} From incoherent
agitation to crushing sleep, from chatter to turning inward, from
overwhelming love to hardening hate, [existence sometimes weakens and
sometimes accomplishes \"being\". And not only do states have a variable
intensity, but different beings \"are\" unequally. A dog that runs and
barks seems \"to be\" more than a mute and clinging sponge, the sponge
more than the water in which it lives, an influential \[human\] more
than a vacant passerby.]{.underline}

In the first movement, where the force that the master has at \[their\]
disposal puts the slave at \[their\] mercy, [the master deprives the
slave of a part of \[their\] being.]{.underline} Much later, in return,
[the \"existence\" of the master is impoverished to such an extent that
it distances itself from the material elements of life]{.underline}. The
[slave enriches \[their\] being to the extent that \[they\] enslaves
these elements by the work to which \[their\] impotence condemns
him.]{.underline}

The [contradictory movements of degradation and growth
attain]{.underline}, in the diffuse development of human existence, [a
bewildering complexity.]{.underline} The fundamental [separation of
\[humans\] into masters and slaves is only the crossed
threshold]{.underline}, the [entry into the world of specialized
functions where personal \"existence\" empties itself of its
contents]{.underline}; a \[[human\] is no longer anything but a part of
being]{.underline}, and \[their\] [life, engaged in the game of creation
and destruction that goes beyond it, appears as a degraded particle
lacking reality.]{.underline} The very [fact of assuming that knowledge
is a function throws the philosopher back]{.underline} into the world of
petty inconsistencies and [dissections of lifeless organs]{.underline}.
Isolated as much from action as from the dreams that turn action away
and echo it in the strange depths of animated life, \[they\] le[d astray
the very being that \[they\] chose as the object of \[their\] uneasy
comprehension. \"Being\" increases in the tumultuous agitation of a life
that knows no limits;]{.underline} it [wastes away and
disappears]{.underline} if \[they\] [who is at the same \"being\" and
knowledge mutilates himself by reducing himself to
knowledge.]{.underline} This deficie[ncy can grow even greater if the
object of knowledge is no longer being in general but a narrow
domain]{.underline}, such as an organ, a mathematical question, a
juridical form. [Action and dreams do not escape this
poverty]{.underline} (each time they are confused with the totality of
being), [and, in the multicolored immensity of human lives, a limitless
insufficiency is revealed; life,]{.underline} finding its endpoint in
the happiness of a bugle blower or the snickering of a village
chair-renter, [is no longer the fulfillment of itself, but is its own
ludicrous degradation - its fall is comparable to that of a king onto
the floor.]{.underline}

[At the basis of human life there exists a principle of
insufficiency.]{.underline} In isolation, [each \[human\] sees the
majority of others as incapable or unworthy of \"being\".]{.underline}
There is fou[nd, in all free and slanderous conversation, as an
animating theme, the awareness of the vanity]{.underline} and the
emptiness of our fellowmen; an apparent [stagnant conversation betrays
the blind]{.underline} and [impotent flight of all life]{.underline}
toward an indefinable summit.

The [sufficiency of each being is endlessly contested by every
other]{.underline}. Even the [look that expresses love and admiration
comes to me as a doubt concerning my reality.]{.underline} A burst of
[laughter or the expression of repugnance greets each
gesture]{.underline}, each sentence or each oversight through which my
profound insufficiency is betrayed - j[ust as sobs would be the response
to my sudden death, to a total and irremediable omission.]{.underline}

This [uneasiness on the part of everyone grows and
reverberates]{.underline}, since at each detour, [with a kind of
nausea]{.underline}, \[humans\] [discover their solitude in empty
night]{.underline}. The universal [night in which everything finds
itself]{.underline} - and soon loses itself - [would appear to be the
existence for nothing]{.underline}, without influence, equivalent to the
absence of being, wer[e it not for human nature that emerges within it
to give a dramatic importance to being and life]{.underline}. But this
[absurd night manages to empty itself of \"being\" and meaning each time
a \[human\] discovers within it human destiny, itself locked in turn in
a comic impasse]{.underline}, like a hideous and discordant trumpet
blast. That which, in me, [demands that there be \"being\" in the world,
\"being\" and not just the manifest insufficiency of human or nonhuman
nature, necessarily projects]{.underline} (at one time or another and in
reply to human chatter) divine [sufficiency across space,]{.underline}
like the reflection of an impotence, of a servilely accepted malady of
being.

II\. THE COMPOSITE CHARACTER OF BEINGS AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF FIXING
EXISTENCE IN ANY GIVEN Ipse

[Being in the world is so uncertain that I can project it where I
want]{.underline} - outside of me. [It is a clumsy man]{.underline},
still incapable of eluding the intrigues of nature, [who locks being in
the me. Being in fact is found NOWHERE]{.underline} and it was an easy
game for a sickly malice to discover it to be divine, at the summit of a
pyramid formed by the multitude of beings, which has at its base the
immensity of the simplest matter.

[Being could be confined to the electron]{.underline} if ipseity were
precisely not lacking in this simple element. [The atom itself has a
complexity that is too elementary to be determined ipsely]{.underline}.
The [number of particles that make up a being intervene in a
sufficiently heavy and clear way in the constitution of its ipseity; if
a knife has its handle and blade indefinitely replaced, it loses even
the shadow of its ipseity;]{.underline} it is not the same for a machine
which, after six or five years, [loses each of the numerous elements
that constituted it when new]{.underline}. But the ipseity that is
finally apprehended with difficulty in the machine is still only
shadowlike.

Starting from an extreme complexity, [being imposes on reflection more
than the precariousness of a fugitive appearance]{.underline}, but [this
complexity - displaced little by little becomes in turn the labyrinth
where what had suddenly come forward strangely loses its
way.]{.underline}

A [sponge is reduced by pounding to a dust of cells]{.underline}; this
living [dust is formed by a multitude of isolated beings,]{.underline}
and is lost in the new sponge that it reconstitutes. [A siphonophore
fragment is by itself an autonomous being, yet the whole siphonophore,
to which this fragment belongs, is itself hardly different from a being
possessing unity. Only with linear animals]{.underline} (worms, insects,
fish, reptiles, birds and mammals) [do the living individual forms
definitively lose the faculty of constituting aggregates bound together
in a single body]{.underline}. But while societies of nonlinear animals
do not exist, superior animals form aggregates without ever giving rise
to corporeal links; \[humans\] a[s well as beavers or ants form
societies of individuals whose bodies are autonomous. But in regard to
being, is this autonomy the final appearance, or is it simply
error?]{.underline}

### Capitalism

#### The reading of the 1NC is a form of artistic poetics that creates a new definition of sovereignty 

**Hegarty, 2k (Paul Hegarty, author and lecturer in aesthetics at
University College Cork,  Georges Bataille: Core Cultural Theorist, pg
)/RF**

From the earliest writings, **[Bataille\'s texts are driven by antipathy
to modern, Western, capitalist society.]{.underline}** If anything,
politics is where Bataille is at his most consistent, even if, as usual,
there are shifts in emphasis and counter-intuitive moves on his part.
WTien we look to assess his political position (s), we have to cover two
distinct aspects: his stated positions, whether to do with the political
position of others, his own, or his view on politics as a category of
activity; and the political implications of his writings. The first set
of aspects is the one that I will deal with directly here, and from
these I will draw out some of the political implications. [The principal
period in which Bataille is most like the figure of the engage, or
committed, writer is the late 1930s. In the articles of this time, he
moves from an emphasis on the valorization of practices from outside
modern society to a more overt criticism of capitalism as an essential
part of the problem that is modern society.]{.underline} The obvious
inference is that the rise of Fascism drove this interest. Similarly,
not only was the Soviet Union\'s alternative significant at the time in
its own right, it too was heading in a very similar direction to
Fascism, and taking on a new significance. During and after the war,
[Bataille becomes much more of a commentator on politics as such, as an
area of human existence, arguing against the apparent need for praxis to
be realized in the figure of the committed writer, who should advocate
action.]{.underline} Politics, for Bataille himself, suffers the same
fate as economics within the general economy: with perfect consistency,
politics cannot be seen as an autonomous realm, except in the
reductionism of restricted economies. With The Accursed Share,
[**Bataille shifts to rethinking what others call politics as movement
within general economy and across to restricted economy**. Everything is
either accumulation and utility or waste and sacrifice.]{.underline}
Despite, or perhaps because of this, he advocates the continued
existence of Stalinism - not because it is the only hope, but because it
performs a specific function, even in its cruelty, in diminishing the
bourgeois, capitalist, Christian individual he considers essentially
limited. [Late texts such as Eroticism might suggest a politics of
sexual liberation, and later essays firmly suggest revolt, refusal, as a
means of subversion. Above all, there is a strong sense of continuity in
Bataille\'s views on politics, but in looking at this continuity we
should not lose sight of the paradoxes or difficulties in these
positions.]{.underline} This chapter focuses on essays from throughout
his oeuvre, and largely leaves the political implications of the major
works to the discussions in earlier chapters. [Capitalism and Marxist,
or bourgeois, society (Bataille tends to blur the cultural and economic)
is a reduction of man\'s potential in an existence of homogeneity.
\'Homogeneous society is productive society, namely useful
society]{.underline} (The Psychological Structure of Fascism\', 138; OC
I, 340), [and **homogeneous society is one of rules,** of exclusion of
what is not the norm, of what is other (heterogeneous).]{.underline}
Such a society leads us to where \'the human masses are at the
disposition of blind forces which condemn them to inexplicable
hecatombs, and which, while making them wait, give them a morally empty
and materially miserable life (\'Popular Front in the Street\', 161; OC
I, 402). [**Within capitalism all of us live miserable lives,** but the
**bourgeois class at least benefits materially**, and is the homogeneous
element of capitalist society - it is the norm, the owner of the system
and consists of those for whom the rules are made. Capitalist society
reduces or eliminates the most important part]{.underline} [of an
individual - the possibility of sovereign existence away from
calculations of utility]{.underline} (this is Bataille\'s line from the
mid-1930s in essays such as [The Psychological Structure of Fascism
right through to the texts explicitly on sovereignty in the late 1950s,
including The Accursed Share,]{.underline} vol. ///: Sovereignty).
[Capitalism removes the artisanal link to the thing made, and make s us
all producers, means instead of ends, making means instead of being
ends.]{.underline} Bataille\'s story is very similar to that told by
Marx, but we can see in Bataille\'s texts so many elements of discord
with Marx that we might wonder what is left of the latter in the former
(who whilst not avowing himself a communist, due to his distrust of
political parties, certainly saw himself as being more or less of a
Marxist). He writes that [Marxism is right about the Infrastructure of
modern society (]{.underline}Th e Psychological Structure of Fascism\',
137; OC I, 339), **[but that it neglects the relevance \'of the
modalities peculiar to the formation of religious and political
society]{.underline}** (137; 339). **[Marxists would of course argue
that they have thought about these aspects]{.underline}**, and that all
the effects are at least linked, if not determined, **[by the economic
base .]{.underline}** It is notable that by \'infrastructure her e
Bataille means \'base structure\', but his term should be read as an
indication of the distance of Bataille\'s text (and in the wider sense,
his oeuvre), **[within which economics is not a means to other ends,
from Marxism.]{.underline}** 1 Bataille argues that religion is
significant in that, in the form of Christianity, it works with
capitalist society to dispose of the sacred. **[What distinguishes this
from Mar x and Marxism is that for them, ther e is nothing beyond the
material.]{.underline}** An even earlier essay notes this problem, in a
way that is only implicit in the essays of the period after 1933: Most
materialists, even though they may have wanted to do away with all
spiritual entities, ended up positing an order of things whose
hierarchical relations mark it as specifically idealist. [They situated
dead matter at the summit of a conventional hierarchy of diverse facts,
without perceiving that in this way they gave in to an obsession with
the ideal form of matter.]{.underline} (\'Materialism\', 15; OC 1,179)
So materialism cannot be the only answer, and in the light of these
comments, which are perfectly consistent with all the political writings
of the 1930s and the postwar texts, we can make the case Politics 149
that Marxism is no mor e than a version of restricted economy. T h e
sacred would be that which exceeds such a concept, and is communal in
that it is the loss of self in a greater whole (even if this whole is
nothing). [Religion Is the source of social authority,]{.underline} (Th
e Psychological Structure of Fascism\', 152; OC I, 360), [on the basis
that its authority does not come from personal value, as is the case
with military authority]{.underline}. Neither does the authority that
come s with religion just represent one form of misleading \'the people
in order to attain power. **[Religion is a particular process within the
development of society: \'the supreme being of theologians and
philosophers represents the most profound introjection of the structur e
characteristic of homogeneity into heterogeneous
existence]{.underline}** (153; 361). So the invention of God both reduce
s the sacred and make s God sovereign in the Bataillean sense, as h e is
beyond the everyday. His place then gets taken by the Idea, the ideal.
Th e arrival of gods, particularly a single god, provides the ground for
the creation of temporal power, and indicates that the question of
general economy precede s that of economics as a version of the
master/slave dialectic (remembering that Bataille\'s own \'version\' of
the dialectic also undoe s dialectical logic). [The creation of social
authority leads us into the realm of political authority, a further
homogenization. From here, Bataille goes direct to the State, missing
out the Marxist link to an economic base. But once we arrive in the
State, modern society is structured in a way that emphasizes the
economic, and creates new forms of poverty and oppression. Th e
combination of deprivations]{.underline} (in terms of power, economics,
lack of community, lack of the sacred) [leads the lower classes,
including the workers, to desire the downfall of the State]{.underline}.
As Stoekl notes, one way or another Bataille has \'an assumption that
democracy in the West is doomed; the choice is between some form of
communism and Fascism (Visions of Excess, 261n.). **[A revolution will
occur - it is just a question of making sure Fascism is not the outcome.
The problem is that Marxism has lost its edge: Lenin is no use any
more]{.underline}** (\'Le probleme de l\'Etaf, OC 1,336), **[and the
Soviet Union has fallen to Stalinism]{.underline}** (333). The workers,
however, still have a faith characteristic of mid-nineteenth-century
radicals (334). Caught between these difficulties, the lower classes no
longer have sufficient force to dislodge 150 Georges Bataille a liberal
State, none of which, Bataille notes, has ever been altered through
revolution into a communist society OVers la revolution reelle\*
\[Towards Real Revolution\'\], OCI, 417). 2 But **[Bataille is far from
rejecting the possibility of revolution, or t he revolutionary potential
of the working class. In a way that is perhaps closer to anarchism, he
emphasizes the need for, or even the inevitability of, the rising of the
wretched in general - and there is no reason why this could not later
include the bourgeois themselves.]{.underline}** It is not economic
necessity alone that will drive the revolution. It will come as the
result of the \'anguish provoked among the working classes by the birth
of the three all-powerful States\* (\'Le probleme de l\'Etat\', 336)
(these being Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union). Fascism has come from
the problems of liberal societies (it is not, for Bataille, simply an
outgrowth of the capitalist system), but needs to be fought by Organic
movements\*, and not via dated communist conceptions of the Party
leading the industrial working class, leading everyone else (\'Vers la
revolution reelle\*, 420). \'Organic movements\* come about at specific
times, in response to events (422), and are able to attack the multiple
targets presented by \'democratic or Fascist society. **[We might,
however, wonder whether this organic movement is not too close to
Fascism. Fascism Ther e might be mor e than a suggestion that Bataille
ha s gone too far, and, given the climate of the 1930s, is heading
towards Fascism. Above all what we see in the often implicit rejection
of central elements of Marxism is an attempt to deal with why Fascism
was happening, and this attempt does lead to moments of ambiguity. This
does not prevent Bataille from continually stating his opposition to
Fascism and nationalism]{.underline}** (Th e Psychological Structur e of
Fascism\'; the articles defending Nietzsche; the \'Contre-attaque
\[Counter-attack\] movement), 3 but the ambiguity is present especially
when he writes on \'heterogeneity\'. According to Bataille, the
heterogeneous realm is all that is outside norms, the controls of modern
society. Fascism exceeds and challenges liberal society, and is
heterogeneous becaus e it Politics 151 aims above and beyond the
utilitarian concerns of capitalism. It appeals to what is \'noble\* (The
Psychological Structure of Fascism\', 145; OC 1,350), [and its cruelty
and purity elevate it above homogeneity]{.underline} (146; 351).
[Fascism exceeds class boundaries, creating an organic social
movement]{.underline} (154; 363). **[Thus far, it might be construed
that maybe Fascism does have something to offer, and although he does
not state it as such, for Bataille it does match some aspiration
neglected by utilitarian society. However, as well as the overt
renunciations of Fascism, he has specific theoretical points to make
which disqualify it. Firstly, Fascism\'s use of the nation as organizing
concept reintroduces homogeneity]{.underline}** (154-5; 363-4), **[and
this homogeneity is solidified in the concentration of power that is the
totalitarian State.]{.underline}** In a later article, he writes [that
Nazism is nowhere near as grand as it thinks it is.]{.underline} Whilst
it could have been an \'epic force, it is nothing more than a
simplistic, militaristic form of nationalism (\'Nietzsche est-il
fasciste? \[\'Is Nietzsche a Fascist?\'\], OC XI, 9). This
authoritarianism renders Fascism \'a servile discipline
(\'Contre-attaque: Appel a faction\' \[\'Counter-attack: Call to
Action\'\], OC I, 396). [Bataille\'s attack on Fascism is closely tied
to his defence of Nietzsche\'s writings, which he argues are
incompatible with Nazism. He writes that Nietzsche\'s writing is way
beyond Nazism, and that \'the distance between Hitler and Nietzsche is
that of a police room compared to the heights of the Alps]{.underline}
(\'Nietzsche est-il fasciste?\', OC XI, 11). Furthermore, he is beyond
all use - he is simply not reducible: \'NIETZSCHE\'S DOCTRINE CANNOT BE
ENSLAVED (\'Nietzsche and the Fascists\', 184: OC I, 450). 4 All of
these statements predate the end of the war, which would reveal the full
horror of Nazism. Bataille condemns the Holocaust as the death of reason
(\'Du rapport entre le divin et le mal \[The Link Between Good and
Evil\'\], OCXI, 206; \'Sartre\', OCXI, 226-8), but has the more
ambiguous response that we also find in Lyotard, whereby the Holocaust
comes to stand as both the ultimate (as in final) human experience and
the experience which cannot be processed, understood (\'Reflexion sur le
bourreau et la victime \[\'Reflections on the Torturer and the
Victim\'\]; OCXI, 262-7). 5 These are both ethically acceptable
positions, but neither really matches the rest of his theory - why
should the gratuitous murder of millions fall outside 152 Georges
Bataille t he general economy? The short answer seems to be there is
good and bad expenditure. How then can h e be sanguine about the
\'becoming object that Stalinism was still inflicting on its population?
He certainly musters what could be seen as a chilling response to
Hiroshima, arguing that we only want to believe it exceptional because
then we can continue ignoring the fact that millions of deaths will
always occur anyway \'Concerning the Accounts Given by t he Residents of
Hiroshima, 221-35; OCXI, 172-87). I am not at all rejecting his position
on the Holocaust, rather observing that it seems significant that he is
unable to place it anywhere in his various systems (unlike Hiroshima).
This might be to do with the enormity of the event, the impossibility of
incorporating it. But Bataille ha s a \'system that can account for
this, so it is particularly interesting that it is further removed from
discourse by not being included. Another statement worth pausing on is
about the \'sovereign sacrifice that Hitler makes in pursuing the battle
of Stalingrad long after it is lost (recalling that a sovereign
sacrifice is not heroism, b ut pointless destruction or loss). [One of
the reasons Nazism haunts us, remaining our heterogeneous other, is that
it is both at t he height of reason, with its efficiency, and at the
height of monstrosity, again due to its efficiency. Bataille\'s way of
raising this is in t he rejection of utilitarianism that is the disaster
of Stalingrad]{.underline} (\'Caprice et machinerie d\'Etat a Stalingrad
\[Whim and State Machine at Stalingrad\'\], OCXI, 472-9). T h e period
after the war sees Bataille treating ideologies from a theoretical
perspective that differs from his earlier approach. **[Fascism is now
seen only in its results, its destruction and murder. Liberal society is
not let off the hook, and communism is rethought - or, more accurately,
its relevance is restated, with the peculiar valorization of the
Stalinist Soviet Union (see Chapter 4 above).]{.underline}** The last
decisive shift to note concerns the base of politics: action.
Revolution, Violence, Action Bataille\'s notion of political action
alters significantly after the war. Before the war, he has a notion of
the possibility of positive political action. Conceivably, the simple
reason for this is the context of the Politics 153 threat of various
nationalist, Fascist and right-wing organizations (France had monarchist
as well as nationalist elements in its right wing). The deeper reason is
perhaps to do with the stage **[Bataille]{.underline}** had reached in
his philosophy: he **[had gone far enough to wish to see the overthrow
of the capitalist system, but not as far as to disbelieve in the
possibility of any alternative.]{.underline}** He did, for example,
believe that surrealism opened up possibilities, but that it was doomed
by the fact that logically it could not succeed. [**Possibly the
defining political paradox in Bataille is the necessity to do something,
and that this something will fail. Surrealism, however, rejects
sovereign failure in favour of aesthetic success and limits. Bataille\'s
notion of action alters, and before the war, moves gradually toward an
anarchist perspective.** Whilst he accepts Marx\'s critique of
capitalism, Bataille is suspicious of the methods of communism and its
results.]{.underline} This is not just to do with an awareness of the
problems of Stalinism, but is also an increasingly critical view of the
Popular Front alliance of communists and socialists that effectively
ended up defending the capitalist system CA ceux qui n\'ont pas oublie
la guerre du droit et de la liberte \[To those who have not forgotten
the just war for freedom\'\], OC 1,399-401). AVhilst the defence against
Fascism is the essential point of the Popular Front, Bataille and
Contre-attaque regarded it as equally important that it attack
capitalism, and attack Fascism (\'Popular Front in the Street\', 165; OC
I, 401). The Popular Front is close to his conception of an Organic
movement\', representing an outbreak of discontent, but it needs to keep
the \'contagion of popular movement going. Here we begin to get the
flavour of what we might categorize as Bataille\'s ultra-leftism:
**[beyond the machinations of communist organizations lies the mass, the
masses - the truly revolutionary, heterogeneous force: What drives the
crowds to the street is the emotion directly aroused by striking events
in the atmosphere of a storm, it is the contagious emotion that from
house to house, from suburb to suburb, turns a hesitating man into a
frenzied being.]{.underline}** It is evident that if, in general,
[insurrections had to wait for learned disputes between committees and
the political offices of parties, then there never would have been an
insurrection]{.underline}. (162; 403) He goes on to note that
[revolutionaries mistake their notions of revolution for the actual
revolution, which is far less susceptible to control]{.underline}. The
revolution can only be \'effervescence\* (\'En attendant la greve
generale \[Waiting for the General Strike\'\], OC II, 254), and this
brings in a sacrificial notion of politics. The question is, [what
exactly is being sacrificed? Capitalism is to be attacked, but t he
problem is that the revolution, in Bataille\'s terms, cannot really
serve a purpose, as it would then have a us e value.]{.underline} Like
Bakunin, Bataille seems to suggest that **[violence itself can bring
about a change, without bringing a particular change: it is the violence
that is creative.]{.underline}** 6 He writes that we attribute us e
value to revolution, but destruction is the real core of such action (Th
e U se Value of DA E de Sade\', 100; OC II, 67). **[This mirrors the
potlatch,]{.underline}** where **[sacrifice does lead to acquisition of
rank, even if the activity is essentially against all ends other than
sacrifice.]{.underline}** Also, [\'it is obvious that all destruction
that is neither useful nor inevitable can only be the achievement of an
exploiter]{.underline} (100; 67). Here, the reference is to the
destruction of something in particular, as in \'imperial war (102n.;
67n.), becaus e the essay then goe s on to specify the \'purest form of
destruction: **[Without a profound complicity with natural forces such
as violent death, gushing blood, sudden catastrophes and the horrible
cries of pain that accompany them, terrifying ruptures of what had
seemed to be immutable, the fall into stinking filth of what had been
elevated - without a sadistic understanding of an incontestably
thundering and torrential nature, there could be no revolutionaries,
there could only be a revolting Utopian sentimentality.]{.underline}**
(101; 67) To return to the question of the Holocaust - because it served
a purpose, however mindless and dreadful, it does not count as
revolutionary action. A mor e troubling case (with regard to the above
logic) could perhaps be seen in the Serbia/Kosovo situation. NATO fought
a war at a distance, unwilling to suffer any loss - is this \'revolting
Utopian sentimentality compared to Serbia\'s continual brutality? In
practice, NATO\'s hands are far from clean, but their way of fighting
war (\'surgical strikes against Iraq) could conceivably be seen as worse
than the cruel abandon of genocide in t he course of war. I [am not
suggesting Bataille believes this to be t he case, but the implication
of his mor e Sadean statements is that excessive destruction will
happen, come what may, and we have to understand this.]{.underline} The
worst, or the least aware, position is the one that replaces war with a
process of \'hygiene\* - the \'grounds for many genocides - and, of
course, the \'reason\* for the gratuitous violence in the former
Yugoslavia. Bataille\*s position is troubling, and mor e so when we
think of t he political implications of what h e says when he is not
discussing politics as such. Nonetheless, he does believe something new
can emerge from violence and sacrifice, but that this cannot be
predicted, controlled in advance. [For this reason, he is mor e in the
anarchist tradition than the nihilistic one, and mor e aware of our
existence as something communa l than Hobbes, Sade or Nietzsche, even if
these are his most obvious precursors. Nowhere is ther e a
recommendation that all life should be about destruction - it is to be
violent at certain instants, but these moments take their force from
being exceptional, and he even writes at one point that the revolution
should aim to abolish both violence and property]{.underline} (\'\[Note
sur le Systeme actuel de repression\]\*, \'\[Note on the Existing System
of Repression\]\* OC II, 134). Bataille\'s view on politics hardens
after the war, in that politics is no longer to be seen as a sphere
worthy of intervention. Even in The Accursed Share, wher e h e advocates
a widening of the Marshall Plan as a form of gift economy, and maintains
the need for t he existence of the Soviet Union as part of a dialectic
of economies, politics is not the site of importance. **[Th e general
economy subsume s all \'spheres\* of moder n society. Society is still
something that could do with changing, but it seems that it can be left
to its own devices, even if mor e expenditure, in whatever form, would
be a good thing.]{.underline}** More specifically, he continually
attacks the notion that a writer must be politically committed. [An
authentic writer, if such a thing is possible, can only be free through
not aspiring for an end beyond the art]{.underline} (\'La litterature
est-elle utile?\* \[ \'Is Literature Useful?\*\], OC XI, 13). **[Art, or
writing, cannot serve another purpose, such as a specific political end,
without losing any chance of being sovereign. This is not to say that
art and writing should aspire to be autonomous, but they should not aim
at anothe r end. Paradoxically, this is the only way art can have a
political impact, and Bataille offers the example of
Picasso]{.underline}** (\'Les peintures politiques de Picasso\*, OCXI,
24). 156 Georges Bataille T h e most obvious target of the critique of
committed writing is existentialism, and Sartre in particular.
[Existentialism must be lived, and not written, or else it is
inauthentic]{.underline}, notes Bataille wryly (\'De l\'existentialisme
au primat de l\'economie \[\'From Existentialism to the Height of
Economy\'\], OC XI, 284). As Bataille\'s own logic implies he should not
write, [he seems to take great pleasure in existentialism\'s constant
assertion of authenticity just wher e it cannot take place.]{.underline}
Similarly, he writes, with reference to Sartre, that surely the worst of
all is to speak of action, while not doing it (\'Lettre a
Merleau-Ponty\', OCXI, 252). 7 As it is not enough, as a response, or as
an alternative, to say that true action is impossible to do or recommend
(\'Le mensonge politique\'\[The Lie of Polities\'\], OCXI, 335),
**[perhaps it is the advocacy of action, it is the bringing into
discourse of commitment, that is the problem. Politics can still play a
role as a \'negative politics of refusal, of revolt]{.underline}** (and
Bataille is positive about Camus on this point). **[This negative
politics is still defined through \'the free spirit \[. . .\] who stays
at a distance from judges and torturers]{.underline}** (\'Nietzsche -
William Blake\', OC XI, 425), but negative it remains, as \'of all
absolute judgements, the most consequential - and the most debatable -
is the political one. It can no longer be a case of positively taking
sides (ibid.). So where does this leave us? It is very difficult to see
what Bataille offers in terms of politics, at least when he deals
explicitly with it. Arguably, [his writings provide the basis for many
political approaches or strategies, particularly those of new forms of
politics,]{.underline} away from the totalizations of traditional
political movements. Equally, he might be suggesting **[\'do nothing\',
or \'make Fascism better\', or \'sacrifice mor e
people\'.]{.underline}** As with Nietzsche, evidence can be found for
many positions and uses, but it is this multiplicity that we should
perhaps take from Bataille\'s texts: **[there can be no one
politics.]{.underline}** Furthermore , given his critiques of use value,
how can we put his writing to use, and be faithful to it? **[How can we
be faithful to it without attributing truth, and therefore an internal
utility.]{.underline}**

### Christian Ethics

#### "Complete self-consciousness" is a totalizing worldview that presupposes religious intimacy and spiritual expression -- the Christian savior ethics within the 1AC \[flesh out per round\] creates social divisions \-- the forbidden Other, the impure bodies, the taboo communities are all marked as a threat to purity of the sacred

**Winters 2017** (Joseph, Winters is an Assistant Professor of Religious
Studies at Duke University. "RAC(E)ING FROM DEATH: Baldwin, Bataille,
and the Anguish of the (Racialized) Human." *Journal of Religious
Ethics*. Volume 2, issue 45, page 380-405, accessed 7/11/17)

In the same manner that Baldwin pulls ethical resources from black
aesthetic and religious traditions, Bataille reinterprets [the writings
and discourses of medieval Christian mystics]{.underline}. As Amy
Hollywood has so powerfully demonstrated, Bataille is one of many
twentieth-century French thinkers attracted to mystical experience [as a
site where certain kinds of constraints and divisions (self/other,
human/god) are both illuminated and transgressed]{.underline} (Hollywood
2002). Drawing from, and re-imagining the tradition of mysticism,
Bataille suggests that religion tells us something about the broader
human condition; or to put it differently, that **[the gen- eral human
condition is itself a religious conundrum]{.underline}**. For Bataille,
[reli- gion indicates our "search for lost intimacy]{.underline}"
(Bataille 2006, 57; Bataille 1991, 57), a quest to be at home in the
world, [a persistent desire to "return" to some undifferentiated
state.]{.underline} But for Bataille, [this quest is both emboldened and
hindered by our investment in being coherent selves, or what Bataille
calls **a "complete self-consciousness,"**]{.underline} **[that views
itself and the world with clarity]{.underline}** (Bataille 2006, 57).
[Our investment in this kind of self keeps us alienated]{.underline}
from others [without extinguishing the desire for home and intimacy;
therefore, this quest often plays itself out by
subordinating]{.underline} experiences, encounters, and [others to
the]{.underline} projects, aims, and [fantasies of the self or
community.]{.underline} For Bataille, **[authentic reli- gious
intimacy]{.underline}**---which can range from pre-modern sacrifice to
mysticism and erotic experience---**[is ec-static, briefly taking the
individual outside of herself, and rendering her vulnerable to the
murky, opaque quality of life's flows and rhythms]{.underline}**. Being
at home is ironically a feeling of being uprooted and unsettled. As an
interruption into the self's projects and schemes, **[religious intimacy
is marked by a range of affects---anguish and joy, pleasure and pain.
This resembles Baldwin's understanding of the blues and spirituals as
expressions of an anguish-filled joy.]{.underline}** Even though
[Bataille]{.underline} is influenced by certain elements of the Chris-
tian tradition---negative theology, mysticism, the wounded, torn nature
of Christ's flesh, the agony of God on the cross---he [refuses the logic
of redemption]{.underline}. [He affirms the Passion, the suffering and
death of Christ, without the promise of victory and restoration
signified by Easter Sun- day.]{.underline} For Bataille, [the logic of
redemption]{.underline}, which [places]{.underline} God's [agony and
suffering into a compensatory telos]{.underline}, entices us [to
associate the sacred with wholeness]{.underline}, t[he divine with
purity, and transcendence with ultimate- ly rising above earthly
contingency.]{.underline} He writes, for instance, "For the Christian
apparently, sacred things are necessarily pure and impurity is profane"
(Bataille 1986, 223). Here we can see another convergence with Baldwin
as Bataille suggests that **[the imaginary distinction between the pure
and impure, and the taboos that regulate the separation, can be
disastrous for bodies and communities that are marked as impure, as a
threat to the purity of the sacred.]{.underline}** At the same time,
Bataille claims that "the fear and trembling . . . \[associated with\]
things sacred . . . are always bound up with horror inspired by a
forbidden object" (Bataille 1986, 223). [There is]{.underline} always
[something other and foreign about the sacred,]{.underline} even [as
we]{.underline} try to [domesticate and tame the discomfiting qualities
of sacred objects and attribute these qualities to the realm of the
profane and obscene]{.underline}. Whereas [the sacred is]{.underline}
typically [imagined as that which needs to be protected from
obscenity]{.underline} and degradation, Bataille suggests that
[religious experience happens when taboos get transgressed, when the
self crosses its limit, or when the imagined border between protected
self and forbidden]{.underline} [Other is shattered]{.underline}. The
sacred is a site of impurity and ambivalence. Or as he puts it,
[religious experience involves a com- munication with the Other marked
by "laughter, dizziness, nausea, loss of self to the point of
death]{.underline}" (Bataille 2014, 42).

### Communication

#### A collapse or failure in the structures of language is necessary for communication to occur. We are a production of difference within communication to be able to realize the very futility of debates own mode of communication.

**Lerman'15 --** Lindsay Lerman -- University of Guelph Philosophy
Department, Graduate Student. Studies Epistemology, Georges Bataille --
"Georges Bataille's "Nonknowledge" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open
Economy of Knowledge" pg 40-43

"Socratic College" also contains multiple [claims that some kind of
**failure is necessarily part of communication.**]{.underline} In this
sense, [what is "fragile" is not just a potential connection because
full or "perfect" connection is simply not possible]{.underline}: what
is "[fragile" in this sense is the content of
communication]{.underline}. Without clearly marking the fact that he is
doing so, [Bataille is slipping from making claims about modes of
communication into making claims about the content of
communication]{.underline}. Bataille is claiming here that [something
will always go unsaid or be unclear in communication]{.underline}.
Similarly, that **[indeterminacy is a permanent feature of attempts at
conceptualization]{.underline}**---that is, [the move from our inner
workings to our reports on those inner workings.]{.underline} This
particular [kind of failure is necessary and unavoidable]{.underline},
and [Bataille advocates allowing]{.underline} and---stronger
yet---[protecting it]{.underline}29: "\[\...\] it is not too much to ask
anyone who persists in wanting to live completely not to put on too many
airs and, as there is always filth where there is life, to get used to
filth" (USN 5).

[This failure is part and parcel of the **impossibility of Bataille's
notion of communication**]{.underline}. Denis Hollier writes:

The [matrix of communication is the principle of inadequacy that
Bataille formulated in this terms: 'Man is what he lacks]{.underline}.'
Consequently, it is the [production of this lack]{.underline} (not its
suppression) [that is the issue]{.underline}. If a being exists only
through communication, then [communication itself is nothing if not the
sacrifice of a being]{.underline}: 'I propose to acknowledge as law that
[human beings are never united with each other except through tears or
wounds']{.underline} \["The College of Sociology" Oeuvres Complétes
2:370\].

In Politics, Writing, Mutilation, Allan Stoekl [claims that Bataille
advocates **embracing "impossible difference**]{.underline}" and
"duplicity" [**in communication**30]{.underline} (99). I intend to push
this claim a bit, however, to say that what [Bataille is encouraging us
to embrace is the very incommensurability of the co-occuring,
simultaneous possibility and impossibility of communication.
Understanding the necessary **failure** of communication is **essential
to understanding what communication is**]{.underline}. This must be
done, according to Bataille, not to shirk the responsibilities
communication saddles us with, but [in order to get to the bottom of the
difficulty---the tension---that is a necessary part of all
communication.]{.underline} In "Socratic College" [Bataille insists that
he is not drawing attention to the insufficiency of human communication
in order to sidestep the challenge of explaining communication
altogether but in order to "get to the bottom of this
difficulty]{.underline}" (USN 6) [which is communicating and explaining
communication.]{.underline}

What is the "[impossible difference" between the possibility and the
impossibility of communication]{.underline}? What is the "[difficulty"
Bataille needs to "get to the bottom of"?]{.underline} It is a
[**failure in communication**]{.underline} that [**has to do with an
inconsistency communication** necessarily requires:]{.underline} "Only
[propositions reduced to a clear form]{.underline}---stripped of poetic
artifice as much as possible---can truly engage consciousness and
connect experiences" (USN 9). And yet (here is the trouble): "A portion
of the [expression of inner experience is necessarily poetic and cannot
be translated into clear propositions]{.underline}, though I can clearly
say that this is so" (ibid; emphasis mine). This particular [failure of
communication is an elaboration on the impossibility]{.underline} that
also [constitutes Bataille's notion of communication]{.underline}. This
[failure--- propositions must be clear in order that experience be
communicable]{.underline}, yet some experiences ([inner experience)
cannot be clearly or fully communicated, especially in propositional
form---is the "impossible difference]{.underline}" Stoekl identifies as
that which Bataille recommends. It is what Bataille strives to
"protect."

And so, Bataille's notion of communication is tense. It is always
animated by a tension between two conflicting facts: communication
fails; communication succeeds. Communication is impossible,
communication is possible. Stoekl interprets this tension thusly:
"[**language is not unitary or simple,**" but this is not the full
story]{.underline} (Politics, Writing, Mutilation 92). [To communicate
adequately, attentively, is an impossible task, but nevertheless, we do
it, Bataille does it, it happens]{.underline}. In "Socratic College,"
[this is an ontological claim]{.underline}. According to Bataille, [it
is a necessary fact of our existence as communicators.]{.underline}

[What does it mean to say that communication can and does
"fail"]{.underline}? For Bataille (in 1942), this [means three
things: 1) Something that is meant to be communicated is not
communicated. When something meant to be communicated is not, Bataille
says that this can be chalked up to (2) a failure of
"authenticity]{.underline}" (USN 5). Bataille states that the "[question
of authenticity"]{.underline} (ibid.) is [always present in
communication]{.underline}. A [failure of authenticity can be the result
of many things]{.underline}: [distraction during
communication]{.underline}, embarrassment or shyness to say what is
meant, lacking an ability to immediately arrive at the "right words,"
[having a weak or insufficient grasp on what a conversational partner
means with her words, not taking the time to determine what the partner
means to say.]{.underline} Bataille's recommendation of not "putting on
too many airs" in communication locates the hub of his notion of
authenticity, and the site of another significant kind of failure in
communication: payin[g greater attention to how one sounds, seems, or
comes across than to the communication with another being: listening,
hearing, responding]{.underline}. The remaining eleven pages of
"Socratic College" suggest that [Bataille wants to endorse a particular
orientation toward communication that is focused on the ability to
listen, hear, and then respond.]{.underline} This new [orientation
toward communication strives for not being too proud or embarrassed to
say what one intends to say.]{.underline} It strives also to [pay
attention to the fragility of communication]{.underline} and the person
with whom one communicates. Indeed, [another "failure" of communication
named in 1942 is (3) pushing that fragile something in communication too
far, **pushing it until it dies.**]{.underline}

### Critical Praxis

#### Their critical praxis attempts to mobilize western hegemony in the postcolonial space allowing violence to manifest itself

**Thobani, 14,** (Sunera, Associate Professor at the Institute for
Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice at the University of British
Columbia, Queer Necropolitics, Pg. XVI, 2014)//Cummings

[Western militarized states]{.underline}, [their nationals and private
mercenaries now form willing coalitions as readily as they organize
death squads]{.underline}; [Western feminists recalibrate their
alignments with their states as they set out to rescue Muslim women or
to protect themselves from their narcissistically construed forms of
precariousnesses]{.underline}; [and Muslim women and men supplicants to
the West speak in the name of feminism and liberal democracy to indict
Islam]{.underline}, [along with their families and
communities]{.underline}, [providing vital alibis for torture and
collective punishment]{.underline}. [All the while]{.underline}, [Muslim
men around the world are demonized as misogynist homophobes even as they
are incarcerated]{.underline}, deported, raped, tortured and targeted
for assassination; Muslim women and queers are raped, killed, [bombed
and compelled to surrender unconditionally to Western gender regimes if
they are to survive]{.underline}. [As for the Muslims killed in the
hundreds of thousands by bombs]{.underline}, drones and militias, [they
do not even appear as human in the register of the war]{.underline},
featuring only as collateral damage -- if at all. [Islamophobia has thus
become the lingua franca that enables trans/national allegiances to be
remade]{.underline}, [international accords to be signed]{.underline},
[aid negotiations to be consolidated]{.underline}, intelligence,
[security and border control agreements to be implemented]{.underline},
[and assassination squads to be deployed across the planet]{.underline}.
[Such is the moment that marks the (re)birth of the West as the singular
model for futurity after the age of independence]{.underline}. What
avenues, then, [for contestation? How to strengthen the forces committed
to ending the violence that characterizes the contemporary geopolitical
moment? What possibilities for the politics of radical transformation?
For justice? Queer Necropolitics makes a particularly timely and
critically engaged intervention]{.underline}. [Mapping out how
deployments of sexuality, gender, race and desire inform the
self-constituting practices of unlikely imperialist
subjects]{.underline} -- queer, feminist, left, and yes, [even critical
theorists and philosophers -- as they simultaneously advance the reach
of the Western empire]{.underline}, the authors of this book highlight
how these practices also mark out entire 'queerly racialized
populations' for occupation, subjugation or elimination ([Puar 2007).
Examining the particularities of the instances where 'queer vitalities
become cannibalistic on the disposing and abandonment of
others']{.underline}, [the authors help to disrupt a critical axis on

### Death

#### Humanity is scared of death, but we must embrace it to form ideologies 

**Hegarty, 2k (Paul Hegarty, author and lecturer in aesthetics at
University College Cork,  Georges Bataille: Core Cultural Theorist, pg
)/RF**

**[Death is]{.underline}** a continual concern for Bataille, from the
earliest writings, to the last fizzles in and around The Tears of Eros,
and arguably sits **[at the centre of the general economy, as death can
be seen as \'the ultimate term of possible expenditure]{.underline}**
(\'Attraction and Repulsion IF, 123; OC II, 332 trans, mod.).
Bataille\'s notion of [death is]{.underline} an empty version of
Hegel\'s: it is [negativity, but one that cannot be
recuperated]{.underline}, even if all our actions can be seen as
attempts at such a recuperation. [Death is the loss that defines our
existence as individuals, since sexual reproduction is absolutely caught
up with the death of the individual]{.underline}; unlike amoebae, there
is no continuity of Being from one organism to the next (The Accursed
Share, 32; OC VII, 39. See also Eroticism, 12-15; OCX, 17-21). Death,
then, is as much part of the inherent wastefulness in nature as life.
**[Death seems to us like the most wasteful form, but for Bataille, such
a conception is to be left behind]{.underline}** (not ignored or
overcome): \'the **[luxury of death is regarded by us in the same way as
that of sexuality,]{.underline}** first as a negation of ourselves,
then - in a sudden reversal - **[as the profound truth of that movement
of which life is the manifestation]{.underline}** (The Accursed Share,
34-5; OC VII, 41). Is death then in some way the truth of Bataille\'s
system? At points it recalls Heidegger\'s notion of \'Being toward
death\', but as with many of Bataille\'s notions, **[the whole issue of
centrality is open to question even as it is posed.]{.underline}**
Bataille argues that [it will always be possible to show that whichever
primordial fact gets priority presuppose s the existence of anothe r
one]{.underline} (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 82; OC VIII, 71). 1 Death
features in early writings - \'beings only die to be born\', \'Solar
Anus\', 7; OC I, 84), and become s something that does not transcend the
individual so much as lose the individual in a generalized excess.
Instead of Hegel\'s mastery of death, [we see that in the fact that life
and death are passionately devoted to the subsidence of the void, the
relation of master/slave subordination is no longer revealed, but life
and void are confused and mingled like lovers, in the convulsive moments
of the end.]{.underline} (\'Sacrifices\', 133; OC I, 93 trans, mod.)
**[Instead of giving in to death, accepting it at a distance, as the
distancing that structure s Being (Heidegger), death is to be embraced,
as \'it appears that no less a loss than death is needed for t he
brilliance of life to traverse and transfigure dull
existence]{.underline}** (Th e Practice of Joy Before Death\', 239; OC
I, 557). This is not because death is so marvellous, but because it is
everywhere, linking the individual to everything else (what Bataille
will go on to call the general economy): [I can only perceive a
succession of cruel splendours whose very movement requires that I die:
this death is only the exploding consumption of all that was, the joy of
existence of all that comes into the world; even my own life demands
that everything that exists, everywhere, ceaselessly give itself and be
annihilated.]{.underline} (The Practice of Joy Before Death\', 239; OCI,
557) Bataille is not arguing from the perspective whereby the universe
only exists in one\'s own mind, but that even we, pathetic individuals
that we are, feature in the ceaseless process of death and destruction.
This linkage of the individual, throug h death, to others, to the
general economy, is what is pursued in Bataille\'s connecting of the
erotic with death, which is a development of the linkage between sex and
death. [In Eroticism he uses the term \'continuity to designate both the
state of shared existence of asexual reproduction and what lies beyond
individuality when individuals lose themselves in sacrifice, erotic
activity, laughter, drunkenness and so on (Eroticism, 11-25; OCX,
17-30). These attempts interest him because \'eroticism opens the way to
death. Death opens the way to the denial of our individual selves (24;
29). Death 57 The second volume of The Accursed Share, subtitled The
History of Eroticism, is often seen as being little more than a draft
version of Eroticism, but there are crucial differences in emphasis. The
History of Eroticism really is a genuine part of the work on \'the
accursed share\', whereas such an economy is only implicit in
Eroticism.]{.underline} More importantly still, the former seeks to link
sexuality to death, and the latter attempts the opposite movement (both
movements, for no clear theoretically necessary reason, lead Bataille to
associate Woman with death). The second volume of The Accursed Share
even starts by stating that it is not really about eroticism, but is
instead \'a thinking that does not fall apart in the face of horror\',
emerging from \'a system of thought exhausting the totality of the
possible (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 14; OC VIII, 10). In writing
about death as part of the general economy, it also emerges that death
is not necessarily literal death. But we should on no account take it as
simply a metaphor, as metaphors imply a reality to be represented, and
Bataille offers no such real world, existing to be represented in
mimesis, metaphor or metonymy. **[Death and Fear Hegel sees death as the
origin of humanity\'s self-consciousness]{.underline}** (this being,
initially, consciousness of death), **[and the rest of time consists of
the struggle to master death.]{.underline}** Communal existence is also
centred around death, and the two combine in the form of architecture.
According to Hollier, for Hegel[, \'architecture is something appearing
in the place of death, to point out its presence and to cover it up: the
victory of death and the victory over death\']{.underline} (Against
Architecture, 6). For Bataille, however, this is precisely the problem:
our society is this fearful covering up of death (whereas the Aztecs,
for example, exposed death in the sacrifice - at the top of, rather than
inside, the pyramid). 2 In The Accursed Share, vol. II, he argues that
**[all society, all individual existence]{.underline}** (as opposed to
the restricted economy of modern individualism) **[emerges from this
fear of death - and this fear is at its most creative when it approaches
death.]{.underline}** 58 Georges Bataille At the same time as [humanity
is drawn toward death,]{.underline} it pushes it away - [this repulsion
is what defines humanity.]{.underline} Repulsion is the key word, as
**[death is not simply a negativity, something that happens to the
subject, but something that, even when it happens to someone else,
provokes disgust. Humanity is defined by its \'repugnance for
death]{.underline}**/ (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 61; OC VIII, 51).
This is hardly a novel or shocking statement, but [death is specifically
part of what repels us because we repel it, and arguably the
(primordial) object of disgust (and only in becoming human does death
constitute something disgusting).]{.underline} Humans have a horror of
all that threatens their unitary existence: excretions, filth, loss of
control through drunkenness, eroticism (61-2; 51-2). More than this, we
also have a horror of life, as at some level we are aware of life as a
by-product of death, so much so that \'we might think, if need be, that
[living matter on the very level we separate ourselves from it is the
privileged object of our disgust]{.underline} (63; 52). All such
disgusts are caught up within taboos, in a relation where it is
impossible to ascertain whether the taboo created the disgust, or
responds to it. For Bataille, however, [**death really is at the heart
of the existence of taboo, but is not the exclusive centre: since it
goes without saying, I will not linger over the possible anteriority of
the horror of death**. This horror is perhaps at the root of our
repugnance]{.underline} (the loathing of nothingness would then be at
the origin of the loathing of decay, which is not physical since it is
not shared by animals) [. It is clear, in any event, that the nature of
excrement is analogous to that of corpses and that the places of its
emission are close to the sexual parts; more often than not, this
complex of prohibitions appears inextricable.]{.underline} (79; 68) This
complex marks the line of demarcation between human and other and
proximity to these phenomena constitutes the crossing of this line. This
crossing and the fear of crossing gives the \'universally human
character of the problem of obscenity (54; 45), even if contra Freud and
Levi-Strauss, for example, there is no particular taboo that is
universal.3 **[Death is also \'at the beginning insofar as its
appearance coincides with labour and utility - this is what makes death
a problem for the individual, as the individual conceives of his or her
self as something to be maintained, preserved and
developed]{.underline}** (82; 70) .**[Death very rapidly becomes the
site of prohibition, and takes two principal forms: both murder and
\'contact with corpses are forbidden]{.underline}** (79; 68). It is not
the metaphysical difficulty of impending death that creates this fear,
since this arises from an awareness that life is an accident between
waste and decay, with only waste and decay in between. As Bataille
notes, life is a luxury of which death is the highest degree (85-6; 74)
and \'moreover, life is a product of putrefaction (80; 69), so [death
and decay are linked to conceptions of our birth and origin]{.underline}
(for him, this accounts for \'our fear of menstrual blood, for example).
Here, as elsewhere, [it is striking how far Bataille goes down a road
attacking preconceptions only to launch into a restatement of tired
cliches about \'woman as other, as death. He simply does not question
the taboos around \'woman\', and this is why Kristeva\'s gloss on
Bataille]{.underline} (Powers of Horror) [and Mary Douglas\'s Purity and
Danger is so successfu]{.underline}l - it completes the logic already
under way. The all-pervasive absence, or denial, of death, through
prohibition, is why death is to be approached, and also why we have an
attraction to as well as repulsion from death and all that threatens our
identity, so that for example, \'eroticism, it may be said, is assenting
to life up to the point of death (Eroticism, 11; OCX, 17). Death and
eroticism remain charged with danger, and create anguish in individuals
as their individuality falls away (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 101; OC
VIII, 88) . 5 But as with Hegel\'s \'facing up to death\', Bataille does
not limit the notion of death to actual biological death - it comes to
include all that undoes the individual, such that the introduction, or
irruption, of death into life makes life become exuberant (99; 86).
**[Erotic activity, for example, must be carried out intensely
(otherwise it is just sex), for \'if the sensations do not have their
greatest intensity, it is possible for us to isolate objects on the
field of the totality (118-19; 102).]{.underline}** By totality,
**[Bataille does not mean the kinds of ideology that account for
everything, but the amorphous sphere beyond subjects, and beyond a
simple subject/object divide. Even if death is not real, there is no
reduction of the experience of approaching death]{.underline}** (we can
never attain death - in this Bataille is with Heidegger). If [we are
instructed that to \'live life to the full we must \'embrace death\',
what do we gain? Nothing muc]{.underline}h, except the awareness of an
impossibility (we do not even gain nothing, as asceticism would aspire
to), but what will have happened is the following: the embrace restores
us, not to nature (which is itself, if it is not reintegrated, only a
detached part), but rather to the totality in which man has his share by
losing himself. For an embrace is not just a fall into the animal muck,
but the anticipation of death, and the putrefaction that follows it.
(119; 103) There is no why, however, and there can only be Virtuar
replies to \'why? - i.e. [there can be the project of approaching
death,]{.underline} as it enhances subjectivity[, but this project is
lost at the moment it is attained, whether in actual death or in
death-like experience (nonexperience).]{.underline} Note also that the
only \'return is to something that is necessarily lost, again and again.
Eroticism, then, is one direction waste or excess can take that involves
death (itself waste, excess), but **[Bataille also hints at another
level at which death can be approached - a level that really is
metaphorical.]{.underline}**

#### The denial of death results in a thanatophobic obsession within the spectacle of destruction. This destroys the ability to create new narratives and create new pedagogies

**Lewis'12 --** Tyson Lewis \-- Tyson E. Lewis is Associate Professor in
the Department of Art History and Art Education at the College of Visual
Arts and Design, University of North Texas. -- "The Aesthetics of
Education" pg 178-181

It is [this accounting for death through new narratives that in turn
must be accounted for. While death might introduce an excess between
word and flesh,]{.underline} Rancière points out that [death is also
what sets in motion explication]{.underline}. In relation to
Rossellini's film Europa 51, Rancière argues, "There is never a lack of
deaths or explanations" (2003c, 111). In the film, [the suicide of a
young boy sends the mother, Irene, searching for answers]{.underline}.
Her question was not "Why did he kill himself" (which conjures up
psychological or socio-economic explanations) but rather "What did he
say" right before he died. Although psychiatrists and socialists attempt
to carve up her question, there is something in her original phrasing
that remains impossible to answer completely. Drawing on Rancière's
reading of this lm, Mark Robson makes the following observation:

[Death is enough to set explanation going, but the explanation that
answers one question may itself be a way of avoiding the posing of
another, more disturbing question]{.underline}. The obscene question
disappears from the scene. Or rather, it disappeared in the act of
explanation, and this is attributable to 'the politicians.' So, then,
th[ere is a politics of the question, a politics of explanation, and, of
course, a politics of death\.... In particular, the explanations that
are all too readily at hand---the usual thanatological suspects---are
rounded up with such ease that they fail to explain
anything.]{.underline} (2011, 185)

In this sense, [death opens up to a flurry of explanations that erase
the event of death]{.underline}---the [introduction of a void into the
order of things that cannot be explained away using the formulas and
predictive theories of politicians]{.underline}, philosophers, or
sociologists. As such, two alternatives must be avoided. [First, denial
of death leaves no room for historical difference to appear. Memory and
recollection of "how Freire was" replace the void that attracts and
stimulates curiosity. Here memory becomes a kind of self-reassurance
that nothing has been lost, that the spirit of Freire remains as it
always was, that he is "right here with us" and thus we do not have to
act on our own within our speci c context without his
guarantee.]{.underline} Second, the quick [procla- mation of death in
order to pass judgment on history equally dispenses with the pensiveness
of death and thus the space of curiosity]{.underline}. The death of man,
the death of history, the death of modernism, the death of politics, the
death of Freire all become foundations for the emergence of a new
explanatory paradigm, a new [cultural logic that appears on the horizon
through a series of "posts]{.underline}" (posthumanism, postmodernism,
postcritical discourse, etc.) [that claim the right to pass judgment
over the dead and thus subsume the past within a totalized horizon of
understanding. What is therefore missed in both cases is a sustained
relation to death as a void in the partitioning of the sensible, a
certain pensive detail that resists death in its dying and in turn
resists giving life to yet another master discourse or explicating
order.]{.underline}

Thus [death is a dangerous figure that dialectically seems to oscillate
in Rancière's work]{.underline}. As Michael Dillon argues (2005), [death
is essential for understanding Rancière's kairological understanding of
emancipatio]{.underline}n. In this argument, death is [neither a
comforting memory nor simply a past needing to be explained
away]{.underline} (thus denying the events of historical change).
Instead, [death becomes a type of messianic mise-en-scene]{.underline},
a staging for the event of translation that simultaneously destroys and
creates. In Dillon's messianic reading, the messianic in Rancière's work
has its own "sacri cial violence" where "any actualized possibility of
egalitarian contin- gency is always the death of some other equality"
(2005, 447). In other words[, for equality to be veri ed, there must be
a "making room"]{.underline} (2005, 447) [through a
sacrifice.]{.underline} Joseph Jacotot's teaching as not teaching is one
prime example of this sacrificial logic at work in Rancière's writings.
This is a [pedagogy that exists in the kairos of emancipation where
dis-identi cation with both the master and the slave is a certain form
of existential death. Thus death is an essential component of both the
arrival of history and the arrival of emancipation]{.underline}.

#### The 1AC's desire to flee death necessitates the subordination of others -- the continuation of life, i.e. the avoidance of \[aff impact, e.g. nuk war\], guards against death, its implications, and the communities that are marked as a threat to reproductive life -- duration also implies racism

**Winters 2017** (Joseph, Winters is an Assistant Professor of Religious
Studies at Duke University. "RAC(E)ING FROM DEATH: Baldwin, Bataille,
and the Anguish of the (Racialized) Human." *Journal of Religious
Ethics*. Volume 2, issue 45, page 380-405, accessed 7/11/17)

For Baldwin, [anti-black racism]{.underline}, while containing its own
particular logics and dynamics, [remains emblematic of a collective will
to innocence,]{.underline} which in turn reveals something fundamental
about the self/other relationship. [Our attachment to being coherent,
durable selves places severe constraints on our capacity to give,
receive, and be open to qualities and circumstances that threaten to
unravel]{.underline} (or dirty) [the self and the imagined order that it
clings to.]{.underline} These ethical themes in Baldwin resonate with
the arguments advanced by literary critic and philosopher, George
Bataille. According to Bataille, the very qualities that make us
human---[our investment in duration, in meaning, and in being
distinguishable from other beings---necessarily **requires us to
subordinate others to our desires and projects**]{.underline} (Bataille
2006, 29). To live in [the "order of things]{.underline}," according to
Bataille, [is to]{.underline} inhabit a world in which beings are
primarily the occasion to [accumulate value, power, and
meaning]{.underline}; beings are subordinated to the logic of
instrumentality and accumu- lation. Consequently, [the continuation of
any individual or collective life require]{.underline}s
[mechanisms]{.underline} that discipline, contain, or exclude that
[which might impede the preservation of that life]{.underline}. As
Bataille writes: [The objective and]{.underline} in a sense
[transcendent]{.underline} (relative to the subject)
[positing]{.underline} [of the world]{.underline} of things [has
duration as its foundation]{.underline}: no thing in fact has a separate
existence, has a meaning, unless a subsequent time is posited, in view
of which it is constituted as an object. [The object is]{.underline}
defined as [an operative power]{.underline} only [if its duration
is]{.underline} implicitly [understood]{.underline}. . . . [Future time
constitutes]{.underline} this real world to such a degree
[that]{.underline} [death no longer has a place]{.underline} in it. But
it is for this very reason that death means everything to it. (Bataille
2006, 46). To some extent, death and its intimations---loss, suffering,
shame, ecsta- sy, vulnerability---cannot have a place in a world defined
by duration and preservation. In other words, [even though death is a
permanent feature of human life, the order of things must cultivate and
imagine ways to diminish, mitigate, and deflect its effects and
implications.]{.underline} We feel this pressure in moments when
instances of [suffering and loss are expected to produce or express some
reassuring meaning]{.underline} (everything happens for a reason; that
person got what he deserved). This mitigating process typically happens
[when individuals and communities locate death, suffering, and excessive
violence elsewhere,]{.underline} in another place and community---[a
strategy that often **justifies**]{.underline} and makes acceptable
[**violent projects** to fix or restore that other
community]{.underline}. Therefore, when Bataille says that "**[death
means everything" to the world of accumulation and
duration]{.underline}**, he is thinking about how the anxiety and horror
around [death is related to our commitment to preserving ourselves in
the future, a commitment that involves various forms of displacement and
deferral.]{.underline} In other words, [the will to futurity intensifies
the anxiety and anguish that accompany thoughts and images of death,
mortality, and vulnerability.]{.underline} Of course, [humans
are]{.underline} also [fascinated with images, and practices, of
violence and death,]{.underline} but only [if they can
experience]{.underline} and view [these images from a comfortable
distance or]{.underline} participate in these practices in a manner that
[reduce]{.underline}s [the risks to the self's coherence and
duration]{.underline}.9 On the duplicity of the self's relationship to
violence, Bataille writes, "[Violence, and death signifying violence,
have a double meaning]{.underline}. On the one hand the horror of death
drives us off, for we prefer life; on the other an ele- ment at once
solemn and terrifying fascinates us and disturbs us profoundly"
(Bataille 1986, 45). What is crucial here is that the order of things,
the order of life preservation, is defined over and against death and
loss---death means everything to this order. Yet I also take Bataille to
be suggesting that [everyday projects and strategies of self-
preservation are **implicated in the**]{.underline} mundane, often
undetected, **ex[ploitation and suffering of others;]{.underline}**
again, death means everything to the real world. Therefore, the human
self is a site of a paradox: the world of proj- ects, goals, and
accumulation "imparts an unreal character to death even though man's
membership in this world is tied to the positing of the body as a thing
insofar as it is mortal" (Bataille 2006, 46). According to Bataille,
[our general commitment to duration]{.underline}, to repro- ducing life,
[will always mean that some being]{.underline}, force, or desire [will
be marked as a threat]{.underline} or danger [to that
reproduction]{.underline}. And [those threats]{.underline} will [have to
be managed, assimilated, disciplined, or subordinated in some
manner]{.underline}. [One's ability to endure in this
world]{.underline}, to accumulate recog- nition, prestige, and various
kinds of capital [means that one must separate oneself]{.underline}, to
some extent, [from those qualities and characteristics that endanger
self or communal projects and aspirations]{.underline}. To put it
differently, life needs to be cordoned off from death and those beings
associated with death (even as we know that life and death are always
intertwined and that certain kinds of subjects and communities are made
more vulnera- ble to death and its intimations). Here Bataille's line of
thought con- verges with Baldwin's point about [social life
provid]{.underline}ing [a]{.underline} kind of [barrier to
"menacing"]{.underline} forces, to [beings]{.underline} and desires
th[at signify chaos and disorder.]{.underline} If Baldwin and Bataille
are right, then **[racism]{.underline}**, which **[is always about
marking, disciplining, and managing "dangerous" bodies and com-
munities,]{.underline}** must be confronted alongside fundamental social
and human limitations.

#### Death structures the ideas of sovereignty, the subject, and the political, death and sovereignty serve as paroxysm of excess all are linked with a correlation to sexuality and violence

**Mbembe, 03,** (Achill senior researcher at the Institute of Social and
Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, Necropolitics,
Pgs. 15-16, 2003)//Cummings

[Georges Bataille also offers critical insights into how death
structures the idea of sovereignty, the political, and the
subject.]{.underline} Bataille displaces Hegel's conception of the
linkages between death, sovereignty, and the subject in at least three
ways. First, [he interprets death and sovereignty as the paroxysm of
exchange and superabundance---or, to use his own terminology: excess.
For Bataille, life is defective only when death has taken it hostage.
Life itself exists only in bursts and in exchange with
death.]{.underline} He argues that death is the putrefaction of life,
the stench that is at once the source and the repulsive condition of
life. [Therefore, although it destroys what was to be, obliterates what
was supposed to continue being, and reduces to nothing the individual
who takes it, death does not come down to the pure annihilation of
being. Rather, it is essentially self-consciousness; moreover, it is the
most luxurious form of life, that is, of effusion and exuberance: a
power of proliferation]{.underline}. Even more radically, Bataille
withdraws death from the horizon of meaning. This is in contrast to
Hegel, for whom nothing is definitively lost in death; indeed, death is
seen as holding great signification as a means to truth. Second,
[Bataille firmly anchors death in the realm of absolute
expenditure]{.underline} (the other characteristic of sovereignty),
whereas Hegel tries to keep death within the economy of absolute
knowledge and meaning. [Life beyond utility, says Bataille, is the
domain of sovereignty. This being the case, death is therefore the point
at which destruction, suppression, and sacrifice constitute so
irreversible and radical an expenditure---an expenditure without
reserve---that they can no longer be determined as negativity. Death is
therefore the very principle of excess---an anti-economy]{.underline}.
Hence the metaphor of luxury and of the luxurious character of death.
Third, [Bataille establishes a correlation among death, sovereignty, and
sexuality. Sexuality is inextricably linked to violence and to the
dissolution of the boundaries of the body and self by way of orgiastic
and excremental impulses. As such, sexuality concerns two major forms of
polarized human impulses---excretion and appropriation---as well as the
regime of the taboos surrounding them]{.underline}. The truth of sex and
its deadly attributes reside in the experience of loss of the boundaries
separating reality, events, and fantasized objects. [For Bataille,
sovereignty therefore has many forms. But ultimately it is the refusal
to accept the limits that the fear of death would have the subject
respect. The sovereign world, Bataille argues, "is the world in which
the limit of death is done away with. Death is present in it, its
presence defines that world of violence, but while death is present it
is always there only to be negated, never for anything but
that.]{.underline} The sovereign," he concludes, "is he who is, as if
death were not. . . . He has no more regard for the limits of identity
than he does for limits of death, or rather these limits are the same;
he is the transgression of all such limits." Since the natural domain of
prohibitions includes death, among others (e.g., sexuality, fi lth,
excrement), sovereignty requires "the strength to violate the
prohibition against killing, although it's true this will be under the
conditions that customs de fi ne." And contrary to subordination that is
always rooted in necessity and the alleged need to avoid death,
sovereignty definitely calls for the risk of death. By treating
sovereignty as the violation of prohibitions, Bataille reopens the
question of the limits of the political. Politics, in this case, is not
the forward dialectical movement of reason[. Politics can only be traced
as a spiral transgression, as that difference that disorients the very
idea of the limit. More specifically, politics is the difference put
into play by the violation of a taboo.]{.underline}

#### All organisms and system are left with a surplus of energy, which we should squander endlessly. Death is the ultimate form of this unproductive expenditure -- an ecological gift to new life. 

**Rowe 17.** James, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at the
University of Victoria. "Georges Bataille, Chögyam Trungpa, and Radical
Transformation: Theorizing the Political Value of Mindfulness", The
Arrow: A Journal of Wakeful Society, Culture, and Politics, 4(2) \|

The sun is a central force in the philosophies of both Trungpa and
Bataille. For Trungpa, the sun is a symbol of basic goodness, and the
human capacity to awaken to it, to become enlightened. For Bataille, the
sun is the material starting point for earthly life, and thus his phi-
losophy. ["Solar energy," writes Bataille, "is the source of life's
exuber- ant development. e origin and essence of our wealth are given in
the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy---wealth---without any
return."65 The sun offers our planet enough energy in one hour to meet
contemporary civilizational needs for an entire year]{.underline}.66
Harnessing this energy, to be sure, is a massive technological
challenge. Moreover, biological life only has limited access to the
superabundance of solar energy that hits the planet every day. But the
amount of energy we can access enables an energetically rich life.
[Bataille's materialist anal- ysis of solar lavishness helpfully
concretizes Trungpa's account of basic goodness, what he also referred
to as "basic richness."]{.underline}67 While Trungpa o ers practices for
people to feel their inherent goodness and richness, actually
experiencing this goodness takes time.68 Without spending hours
meditating, and slowly uncovering a tender and radiating heart,
Trungpa's teachings on basic goodness and richness can appear ideal-
istic. [Bataille's materialist account of solar generosity further
evidences Trungpa's philosophy; it offers strong conceptual proof that
can height- en commitment to the experiential practice of meditation. "
The sun gives without ever receiving," argues Bataille.]{.underline}
"\[Humans\] were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured
that ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they
associated its splen- dor with the act of someone who gives without
receiving."69At a basic biological level, the sun's exuberance means
that "on the surface of the globe, for living matter in general, energy
is always in excess, the ques- tion is always posed in terms of
extravagance."70 Put more succinctly: "[We receive more energy than we
can use."]{.underline}71 e basic planetary con- dition is wealth more
than poverty. [The essential meaning of Bataille's claim that
luxury---not necessity---organizes life on earth is that all organisms
have access to more energy than required for subsistence, thanks to the
sun's exuberance. is excess is often invested in biolog- ical growth (at
the level of an organism, species, or ecosystem). But growth can never
fully exhaust the energy available to an individual organism or
biological system. All organisms and systems are left with a surplus to
spend "willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically."]{.underline}72
Evidence of earthly richness includes the ornate colors and plumage of
the animal kingdom that seemingly exceed evolutionary use-value.
Similarly, consider the capacity for pleasure su using animal life,
espe- cially all the sexualized pleasures apparently unrelated to
procreation. Even when a sensory pleasure is associated with basic
functioning like a good sneeze, excretion, or stretch, there can still
be sumptuousness to the sensation (need it feel so good?). A sneeze is
arguably basic good- ness at work, a ash of solar exuberance amidst our
everyday lives. Consider, also, the ubiquity of queerness across the
animal king- dom. According to Bruce Bagemihl, author of Biological
Exuberance (a book that draws heavily from Bataille), "homosexuality is
found in virtually all animal groups, in virtually all geographic areas
and time periods, and in a wide variety of forms."73 But why, asks
Bagemihl, "does same-sex activity persist---reappearing in species after
species, generation after generation, individual after individual---when
it is not useful" from a strictly evolutionary perspective?74 Bagemihl's
answer is that use and necessity are not life's sole organizing
principles: "Natural systems are driven as much by abundance and excess
as they are by limitation and practicality. Seen in this light,
homosexuality and non- reproductive heterosexuality are 'expected'
occurrences---they are one manifestation of an overall 'extravagance' of
biological systems that has many expressions."75 [For Bataille, our
primordial condition is marked by richness thanks to the lavishness of
the sun. And then, of course, we die. Death can easily appear as proof
of our ultimate poverty; it seemingly mocks attempts to assert the basic
richness or goodness of life. But Bataille reads mortality as another
marker of life's luxuriousness.]{.underline} Large mam- mals like us are
impressive condensations of energy (we are ourselves only possible given
energetic wealth). is [energy is then extravagantly squandered upon our
necessary deaths. "When we curse death," argues Bataille, "we only fear
ourselves\... We lie to ourselves when we dream of escaping the movement
of luxurious exuberance of which we are only the most intense form."76
Death's energetic squandering is also an ecological gift for the new
life arising from decay: "\[Humankind\] conspires to ignore the fact
that death is also the youth of things."77]{.underline} Bataille's
reading of death as exemplary of basic goodness supports Trungpa's
encouragement to ["make friends with our death," and to not resentfully
cast it as "a defeat and as an insult."78 Tibetan culture, according to
Bataille, is more successful than Eu- ro-American ones at affirming the
totality of life.]{.underline} For Bataille, cultur- al forms that
communicate this a rmation are glorious expenditures of basic energetic
wealth. e resentment that animates so many Eu- ro-American cultural
forms is itself enabled by energetic exuberance, a "catastrophic" use of
our basic richness.79 And the Euro-American desire to escape our
corporeality only intensi es feelings of lack and malaise by
disconnecting us from the earthly exuberance alive in our changeful
bodies. For Bataille: [Anguish arises when the anxious individual is not
himself stretched tight by the feeling of superabundance]{.underline}.
is is precisely what evinces the isolated, individual character of
anguish. ere can be anguish only from a personal, par- ticular point of
view that is radically opposed to the general point of view based on the
exuberance of living matter as a whole. Anguish is meaningless for
someone who over ows with life, and for life as a whole, which is an
over owing by its very nature.80 Energetic poverty and lack are
realities for life on earth. But they are always felt by particular
beings at particular times; energetic lack is not our general or basic
condition. And yet the more we separate ourselves from exuberant life
energies in attempts to gain dominion over them, the more liable we are
to experience lack; we progressively remove our- selves from nature's
over ow. Bataille was interested in nurturing a sovereign---rather than
ser- vile---human encounter with existence: " e sovereignty I speak of
has little to do with the sovereignty of states\... I speak in general
of an aspect that is opposed to the servile and the subordinate."81
Viewing humans as agents of life's exuberance, Bataille saw sovereignty
as hu- manity's "primordial condition."82 [We are regal and rich from
birth. But this sovereignty is tarnished when we cower before ourselves
and the teeming life energies we issue from, return to, and are animated
by.]{.underline}

### Debate 

#### The academic bickering of debate cannot be separated from warfare. The intellectual efforts of debate are nothing more than a phenomenalized expression of militaristic thought. The form of the 1AC is a double turn with its content. Vote negative. 

**Mann 96** (Paul, emeritis professor of English at Pomona College, PhD
in English from University of Santa Cruz, MA in English from the
University of Chicago, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare," in
Postmodern Culture, Johns Hopkins University Press, 6.2)

**[We are about to witness a rise of \"war studies\"]{.underline}** in
the humanities. On your next plane trip the person beside you dozing
over a copy of Sun Tzu\'s Art of War might not be a corporate CEO but a
professor of philosophy. **[There will soon be whole conferences on
warfare; more courses in liberal arts curricula on the theory and
literature of warfare; special issues of journals on war studies
published not by historians or social scientists but by literary
critics]{.underline}**; new studies of the culture of the Kriegsspiel;
new readings of Homer, Kleist, Crane**[. Books of gender criticism on
the subject of war are already appearing]{.underline}**, and essays on
Clausewitz are now liable to turn up in literary journals and books of
critical theory. And **[we will hear more and more of the sort of moral
outrage critics exercised during the Gulf War over the way the
video-game imagery of computer simulations displaced grievous bodily
harm.]{.underline}** Perhaps this imminent frenzy of production will
open another front in the current campaign against the aesthetics of
ideology. **[To the extent that modern warfare depends on the eclipse of
the real by images, cultural critics would seem especially qualified to
analyze it.]{.underline}** Elaine Scarry: \"it is when a country has
become to its citizens a fiction that wars begin.\" If this is the case,
**[if war arises from an investment in certain fictions, then critics of
fiction ought to be able to teach us to read war critically \-- and,
along the way, to establish the moral and political gravity of their own
work. What is at issue here, however, are not only analyses of war but
also analogies of it. We will burrow into the archives of warfare
because we will see, or at least want to see, criticism itself as a form
of warfare. We will project an image of ourselves onto a field of study
and recognize our reflection in it. Gender critics already study war
discourse in order both to attack its violent phallicism and to conceive
gender struggle itself along strategic lines. We have theory wars, PC
wars, linguistics wars, Gerald Graff\'s culture wars, Avital Ronell
appropriating the war on drugs for a theory of reading. Vast energies
will be expended not only on the archives and rhetoric of warfare but on
the warcraft of rhetoric and critical inquiry, on the \"violence\" of
the question, on the \"mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and
anthropomorphisms\" that, for Nietzsche, make up what is called
truth.]{.underline}** We will pursue the subject of warfare because
**[we will increasingly see a relationship between our own activity and
warfare.]{.underline}** Let me articulate the law that governs this
movement: **[Critical discourse always tends toward the eventual
phenomenalization, as objects of study, of the devices that structure
it. War becomes a field of critical study when critics come to believe,
however obliquely, that criticism has always been a field of warfare.
And warfare not only in the narrow terms of intellectual difference, but
in the most material terms as well]{.underline}**. If, for Clausewitz,
**[war is an extension of policy]{.underline}**, for Paul Virilio the
reverse is true: **[politics and culture are, from the outset,
extensions of warfare, of a logistical economy that encompasses and
ultimately exhausts all of society. Standard critiques of the
coordination of scientific research with the \"military-industrial
complex\" are already being extended to include the ideological state
apparatus;]{.underline}** for Virilio, **[technology as such is a
logistical invention and in one way or another always answers logistical
demands, and the same point will be made about technologies of
representation.]{.underline}** The humanities are in a mood to see the
complicity of what Enzensberger called **[the \"consciousness industry\"
in the military-industrial-knowledge complex, to see themselves at one
and the same time as ideological agents of the state\'s \"war machine\"
and as warriors against the state]{.underline}**. I will have more to
say about this contradiction. To repeat: **[The object of criticism is
always a symptom, if you will, of the structure of critical discourse
itself, always a phenomenalization of the device. But this device tends
to appear in a surrogate form, still dissimulated and displaced; it
appears and does not appear, makes itself known in ways that further
conceal its stakes. And it always appears too late, at the very moment
it ceases to function: a kind of theory-death, a death that is not a
termination but a particular sort of elaboration.]{.underline}** **[Now,
everywhere we look, critics will be casting off their clerical mantles
and rhetorical labcoats for suits of discursive armor; the slightest
critical aggression or ressentiment will be inflated with theoretical
war-machines and territorial metaphorics.]{.underline}** At the same
time, **[the very rise of war discourse among us will signal the end of
intellectual warfare for us, its general recuperation by the economics
of intellectual production and exchange. It might therefore be
delusional]{.underline}** \-- even, as some would argue, obscene, given
the horrible damage of real war \-- **[to think of this academic
bickering as warfare, and yet it remains a trace of war, and perhaps the
sign of a potential combat some critical force could still
fight.]{.underline}** It would be a mistake to assume that this
metamorphosis of discourse as war into discourse on war has occurred
because criticism has become more political. On the contrary,
**[criticism has never been more than a political effect \-- \"policy\"
carried out, and in our case dissipated, by other means. The long
process of seizing politics as the proper object of criticism is one
more tardy phenomenalization of the device.]{.underline}** What we
witness \-- and what difference would it make even if I were right? \--
is not proof of the politicization of criticism but **[an after-image of
its quite peripheral integration with forms of geopolitical conflict
that are, in fact, already being dismantled and remodeled in war rooms,
defense institutes, and multinational corporate headquarters. War talk,
like politics talk, like ethics talk, like all critical talk, is
nostalgic from the start. While we babble about territories and borders,
really still caught up in nothing more than a habitual attachment to
disciplinary \"space\" and anxious dreams of \"agency,\" the technocrats
of warfare are developing strategies that no longer depend on any such
topography, strategies far more sophisticated than anything we have
imagined. And we congratulate ourselves for condemning them, and for our
facile analogies between video games and smart bombs.]{.underline}** I
would propose two distinct diagnoses of the rise of war talk. On one
hand, **[war talk is merely another exercise in rhetorical inflation,
intended to shore up the fading value of a dubious product, another
symptom of the imaginary politics one witnesses everywhere in critical
discourse, another appearance of a structural device at the very moment
it ceases to operate. On the other hand, war talk might still indicate
the possibility of actually becoming a war machine, of pursuing a
military equivalent of thought beyond all these petty contentions, of
realizing the truth of discourse as warfare and finally beginning to
fight.]{.underline}** **[It will be crucial here not to choose between
these diagnoses. In the domain of criticism they function
simultaneously, in a perpetual mutual interference; there is no hope of
extricating one from the other, no hope of either becoming critical
warriors or being relieved of the demand that we do so.]{.underline}**
The real task of this prediction is thus not to make any claim on the
future, but rather to pursue a sort of genealogy, in Nietzsche\'s or
Foucault\'s sense, in reverse: a projective genealogy, so to speak: an
account not so much of the future as of the present, of the order of
knowledge at this very moment. **[War here is a way to theorize
discourse as collective behavior, to reconceive shifting positions,
alliances, defenses, attacks, casualties and losses, logistical
strengths and weaknesses, the friction and fog of discursive
conflict.]{.underline}** I will sketch out nine grounds of intellectual
warfare: Logistics, Logomachia, Fortification, the Desert, the Screen,
Number, High Ground, Chaos, and the Cemetery. These grounds are not
exhaustive and do not constitute a singular field; they are not arranged
in a logical sequence and do not amount to a single argument moving
toward a single conclusion. War looks different from the vantage of each
ground. During a given campaign an army or a writing might find itself,
at different times, in different tactical situations and encounters,
occupying several or all of these grounds, and deploying its forces in
different arrangements. In this essay, the nine grounds do not amount to
any telos, any whole, nor even an intellectual position, but in my
movement among them I hope to indicate, in the most preliminary and
doubtless futile manner, strategies for a critical writing that might
actually learn from the war machines it studies.

### Education

#### The university's barbaric practices perpetuate societal inequality through the adoption of empiricism and double objectification of the self.

**O'Sullivan 16.** Michael, Convenor of Research Committee at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong. "Academic Barbarism, Universities and
Inequalities" \|

Henry refers to the methodologies of the disciplines that follow this
version of scientism as "ideologies of barbarism.\" He argues that [many
university disciplines today "thematise nature\" or "pretend to speak of
man\"]{.underline} (la barbaric, 2004, 131). [The "objective body,\" or
the "empirical individual posited\" is, for Henry, the product of "a
double objectification\"]{.underline} (Ia barbaric, 2004, 143).
[This]{.underline} "double objectiﬁcation" [takes on a whole new meaning
in the age of the social network]{.underline} and the online avatar. The
objectivity that is suggested here is double in the sense that [what is
objectiﬁed is not life itself according to the \"phenomenological
actuality of its auto-affection," but the "self- objectification of life
under the form of an unreal signiﬁcation"]{.underline} (la barbaric,
2004, 139). In other words, [university disciplines posit "empirical
individuals\" or ﬂawed descriptions of subjects as objects for
investigation.]{.underline} Henry argues that [the "self-objectification
of life\" that "is posited and presented before us is never life itself,
\[\...\] but its empty representation\"]{.underline} (la barbaric, 2004,
138)! The "human being" of the "human sciences" is itself an
objectiﬁcation, categorization, or representation. Henry argues that the
"objectivism of the Galilean project," (la barbaric, 2004, 143) that has
inaugurated for him an ideo- logy of science or barbarism, \"inevitably
presupposes in the human sciences both this given precondition of the
empirical individual and therefore the double objectification that has
come into question\" (Ia barbaric, 2004, 143). [This double
objectification affects all aspects of life, including sexuality, which
is \"examined\" solely in terms of "a certain number of
behaviours\"]{.underline} (la barbaric, 2004, 144) and a rep- ertoire of
functions such as "age, sex, class, type of society, and the enumeration
of the circumstances in which it is accomplished" (la barbaric, 2004,
144). Henry\'s work here echoes many of the themes elaborated in Michel
Foucault\'s work on sexuality.' The second essential component of every
discipline of this genre is the development of "the proiect of
knowledge" (la barbaric, 2004, 148). [Academic industries and research
bodies must decide what criteria must be retained as "essential deﬁning
characteristics of the object of research\"]{.underline} (la barbaric,
2004, 148) for it is only when \"these characteristics have been
circumscribed and situated in a relation of unity that one is able to
undertake the construction of laws" (la barbaric, 2004, 148) for the
promotion of a particular science. This recalls Jacques Derrida\'s
description of the "new censorship\"8 in the university. Henry argues
that both of these processes have important repercussions when they
become implicated in our understanding of ethics. He argues that
[sciences of "this genre\" invest in a "pure objec- tivism\" that is
irrelevant to every instance of moral choice. Society, in its rush to
embrace new technologies or new forms of research, rarely considers how
they bring new ethics with them]{.underline}; Nicholas Carr argues that
"the intellectual ethic of a technology is rarely recognized by its
inventors\" (45). As Walter J. Ong reminds us, "technologies are not
mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness\"
(in Carr 2010, 51). For Henry, it is only a phenomenological descrip-
tion of \"real life\" that is capable of providing the "moral" ground
for any new "intellectual ethic\" and it can never be a consideration
for a science that regards the "empirical individual\" as its
precondition.9 Henry also deﬁnes barbarism as "an unemployed energy
\[Henry's emphasis\]\" (la barbaric, 2004, 177) and "energy," for him,
is "the irrepressible test of that which fulﬁlls itself and ﬁlls itself
with itself to the point of excess \[\...\] every culture is the
liberation of an energy, the forms of this culture are the concrete
modes of this liberation\" (la barbaric, 2004, 174). [This recalls
Georges Bataille\'s sense of "unemployed negativity,\" a notion that
takes on new meaning for today's "Europe of Knowledge\"]{.underline}
where in some southern European countries there is 50 percent youth
unemployment.lo [Bataille devises the notion of "unemployed
negativity]{.underline}\" for his end-of-history perspective in his
famous letter to Alexandre Koieve from December 1937. He surmises: \"I
can assume (as a likely hypothesis) that from that this point on history
has been completed (with the exception of its outcome). \[\...\] lf
action ('doing') is---as Hegel says---negativity, the question then
arises as to knowing if the negativity of one who 'no longer has any-
thing to do\' disappears or remains in the state of \'unemployed nega-
tivity\' \[\...\]." (in Corn, 84---5) Bataille argues, for his own time,
that: [In effect, since the man of "unemployed negativity\" does not
find in art an answer to the question that he himself is, he can only
become the man of "recognized negativity.\"]{.underline} He has
understood that his need to act no longer had a use. But since this need
could no longer be duped by the enticements of art, one day or another
it is recognized for what it is: as negativity empty of content He
stands before his own negativity as before a wall. (in Corn, 86) In an
era when "unemployed negativity" has taken on a whole new meaning for
the continent that gave us our traditional notion of the university, [it
is timely to consider how the university with its "practices of
barbarism" has contributed to heightened levels of unemployment and
inequality in our societies]{.underline}. As educators do we want to see
students on our four-year BA courses or on our lengthy PhD courses
witness this \"contravention\" of their potential and energy where "a
stagnation, \[a\] regression\" leads to the "self-negation of life" (Ia
barbaric, 2004, 178)? For, in regression, as Henry explains, "neither
the energy nor the affect disappear, on the contrary they serve to bring
being through itself to a heightened degree of tension" (la barbaric,
2004, 185). Paul Verhaeghe has observed how society's promotion of our
academic industry's notion of meritocracy has exac- erbated this
heightened state of unemployed energy, tension, and risk in young
people. I examine this in more detail in the next chapter. For Henry, it
produces ennui and ennui is "precisely the affective dis- position in
which unemployed energy reveals itself to itself" (Ia bar- baric, 2004,
191). We are witnessing the trickle-down effects of these educational
philosophies. [These states of tension, anxiety, and ennui are integral
to what Zygmunt Bauman calls our society's transforma- tion of identity
into a "task"]{.underline} and to the risk that is ever-present in our
promotion of individualization. However, [the academic industry may
indeed be so caught up in the financing of its corporate model of
education! management that it has lost sight of how it is enforcing and
developing these "practices of barbarism\".]{.underline}

#### Education is rooted in the necropolitical state and is responsible for the instruction of the sovereign

**Gržinić, 10**, (Marina, Philosopher employed at the Institute for
philosophy at the Slovenian institute for science and arts,
Necrocapitalist education, market freedom, de-sustainability, pg. 1,
published in the fall of 2010)//Cummings

Further, two processes of necropolitics are put forward today in the
global capitalist world. [One is necropolitics as a process of a simple,
clear, direct destruction of life that, as stated by Achille Mbembe
presents the exposure of life only to the power of death, mostly seen in
all the so called third worlds]{.underline}, Haiti is one of the last
examples. The second is a process in the First Capitalist world where
life is a life of subjugation and re-contextualisation only and solely
to the needs of the capitalist market. In both cases [it is possible to
state that not one aspect of life, work, education, communication,
culture, politics, economy can be seen as being outside the forms of
capital exploitation, though the capitalist system claims completely the
opposite.]{.underline} 3. [Education in such capitalist mode of
production that is in the present case necrocapitalism, necropolitics
and necropower]{.underline} (therefore we claim that capitalism has
history and biopolitics should be historized) [can be termed accordingly
as necrocapitalist global education. It presents education only fberal
human capital. Circulation of capital is the condition of constructing
the social onto and as the logic of the market]{.underline}. Circulation
of capital is the only terrain for any institutional, cultural,
ideological, epistemological connection and development of these
spheres. Therefore we have as well a persistent colonization inside and
outside as a measure for over passing (natural) borders when capital
spreads. Global knowledge is nothing more than the minimum of knowledge
for maximum of skills in order to prove a proper humanity. To say this
differently, the global knowledge and knowledge circulation seen from
the present educational view is in the last instance the repressive and
formative force in the context of necropolitics.

### Environment

#### **Heliocentrism sustains itself through the obsession with organic systems of thought and consumption -- this is enhanced by the technocratic managing of society -- this form of new capitalism masqurades itself as "saving the planet" yet is invested in the sustainment of itself rather than staring into the abyss that is death. Affirm the cosmic abyss**

**Negarestani'10 --** Reza Negarestani Iranian philosopher, artist, and
writer; contributes to Collapse and CTheory regularly (Solar Inferno and
the Earthbound Abyss) KZaidi

Like all modes of slavery, [heliocentrism has its own market strategy;
it is called base-capitalism]{.underline}. For schizophrenic
[capitalism, whilst everything should be accelerated towards a
techno-economic meltdown along paths of expenditure entrenched in solar
economy, modes of life as ever more con- voluting circuitous paths
towards death must not only be embraced but also emphatically
affirmed.]{.underline} The seemingly [paradoxical proclivity of capital-
ism]{.underline} -- that is to say, its [concomitant dynamism towards
thanatropic meltdown]{.underline} and its advocation of lifestyles --
amounts to the very simple fact that [for the Sun the phenomenon of life
on the planet is but a modal range of energy dissipation prescribed by
the solar economy and afforded by organic systems.]{.underline} This
does not merely suggest that [death]{.underline} -- especially for
planetary entities -- [is inevitable but that such death or vector of
exteriorization is exclusively restricted to modes of energetic dis-
sipation]{.underline} (modes of life) [that the Sun imposes on the
planet]{.underline}. Yet these mod[es of energetic dissipa- tion which
exteriorize Earth are themselves part of the economy of the Sun which
also mark its economic restrictions and limits of affordability against
its abyssal and exterior cosmic backdrop. Capitalism]{.underline}, in
this sense, [conceals its restricted economy in regard to the cosmic
exteriority]{.underline} (or death) [by overproducing modes or styles of
life]{.underline} which are in fact different rates of energetic dis-
sipation or circuitous paths of expenditure. To put it differently,
[capitalism]{.underline} which terrestrially [envelops the restricted
economy of the Sun in re- gard to death and exteriority masquerades as
the so-called general and free economy]{.underline} in regard to life
and the problem of consumption.

The [interiority of life on Earth rests on the thermo-nuclear
interiority of the Sun which]{.underline} itself is [contingent upon its
exterior cosmic backdrop. Solar capitalism is only a market for
representing the Sun as both an inevitable and unfathomably rich
exteriority for the planet]{.underline} and terrestrial life,
[marketing]{.underline} the energetic model of the [Sun as the only way
to the great outdoors of the abyss]{.underline}. Yet it is precisely the
Sun that circumscribes the image of such outdoors and narrows the
speculative op- portunities ensued by thought's binding of radical
exteriority. [In line with the vitalistically pluralist and
thanatropically monist regime of solar econo- my, Earth can be
reinvented and recomposed only as a new planet or slave of the
Sun]{.underline} whose life and death are emphatically determined by its
star or exorbitant source of energy. [On such a planet, the ventures of
thought and art are burdened by a nar- row scope in regard to cosmic
exteriority imposed by the Sun]{.underline} as well as the axiomatic
submission of terrestrial life to the empire of the Sun.

Just as the pluralist regime of life inherent to solar economy is
parasitically hydrophilic, the [in- dulgence of capitalism in lifestyles
and vitalistic detours also has an intimate af nity with terres- trial
juices]{.underline}. The [solar]{.underline} model of [consumption can
duplicate itself as the dominant energetic model wherever life
emerges,]{.underline} that is to say, [wherever water exists. Water can
implement the energetic peculiarities of the solar climate]{.underline}
in quite a vitalis- tic fashion and thus, [re-enact the Sun's model of
energy expenditure within manifestations of life]{.underline}.
[Capitalism]{.underline}, in a similar manner, [sniffs out plan- etary
waters so as to employ its models of accu- mulation and
consumption]{.underline} through their chemical potencies. This is [not
only to use the hydraulic ef- ciency of terrestrial waters in order to
propagate its markets and carry out its trades, but more im- portantly
to overlap and associate its indulgences]{.underline} with the very de
nitions and foundations of life. Since terrestrial [waters]{.underline}
(or liquid forms in gen- eral) are [closely associated with the formula
of life, by investing in them and operating through them capitalism can
also give a biopolitical sense of inevitability]{.underline} (in terms
of growth and vitality) to its rules and activities. In dissolving into
ter- restrial waters, [capitalism like solar energy can create climates
or contingencies of its own on the planet,]{.underline} triggering the
rise of new territories, lines of migrations and reformations. Yet
[water is an open receiver of chemistry as the applied dynam- ics of
contingencies]{.underline}. As previously mentioned, [if terrestrial
waters are attractors of contingencies or chemistry, then they do not
merely imple- ment solar climates but also energetic models of
dynamism]{.underline} associated with other contingencies or cosmic
climates. Accordingly, [terrestrial waters develop into sites for the
irruption of contingen- cies]{.underline} into the already established
and interioriz[ed contingency which in the case of the planet Earth is
solar economy]{.underline} of the Sun and its restricted climates.
Therefore, [terrestrial waters are agents of complicity]{.underline}
whereby [cosmic climates irrupt into the interiority of terrestrial life
itself]{.underline}. It is [this irruption of cosmic climates that draws
a line of exteriorization or loosening into the abyss]{.underline}
forboth the terrestrial life and the climates generated by the Sun.
However, the [complicity between the water of life and cosmic climates
or what we call chemistry is endowed with a chemical slant; it gives the
death of life and water weirdly produc- tive aspects]{.underline}. The
irruption of cosmic climates into the terrestrial biosphere [generates a
dynamics of death or line of exteriorization]{.underline} whose
expression and dynamism are chemical rather than [spectral, ghostly or
hauntological]{.underline}. The dying water is blackened into heaps of
slime and the biosphere feeding on such water respectively dies or
chemi- cally loosens into the cosmic exteriority. As [these
deaths]{.underline} have chemical slants, they [spawn more contingencies
or lines of chemical dynamisms which render the universe climatically
weird. This]{.underline} climatic [relationship]{.underline} between a
dying Sun and a dying Earth [as chemically projected in water has been
intriguingly portrayed]{.underline} by the artist Pamela Rosenkranz.
What Rosenkranz artistically pro- poses is that water -- despite its
apparent loyalty to terrestrial life -- chemically unbinds the potencies
of cosmic contingencies whose inevitable irrup- tion into our super
cially solar world necessitates a chasmic terrestrial ecology.

Cosmic Ecology or the Order of the Weird

[Life]{.underline} ecologically [extinguishes as its waters
die,]{.underline} or more accurately, as they chemically react with
other cosmic contingencies whose climates are exterior to that of
terrestrial life and its solar bonds. Since th[e expression of dying
water signifies nothing but a chemical marriage between water and cosmic
contingencies, ecological death means nothing but to perish via a
blackening water]{.underline} which is too chemically potent to support
the vitality of life or endurance of survival. Eco- logical [death
becomes a form of descent into the cosmic abyss]{.underline} which is
chemically too productive to be considered either misanthropically
gloomy or post-humanistically promising. [This ecological death of Earth
is strongly reminiscent of]{.underline} Victor Hugo's [description of
the appalling slime pools of Paris]{.underline}: "\[I\]n a pit of slime
\[\...\] the dying man does not know whether he has become a ghost or a
toad. [Everywhere else the grave is sinister, here it is
shapeless."]{.underline} (Victor Hugo, Les Misérables)

In the slimy grips of a universal nature whose contingencies have
chemically irrupted into the water of life, [the ecological death of
Earth is a weird chemical reaction from which no ghost emerges to either
haunt the universe or demand an appropriate mourn.]{.underline}

[Being truly terrestrial is not the same as be- ing
superficial,]{.underline} that is to say, it is [not the same as
considering Earth as a planetary surface-bio- sphere]{.underline} (slave
of the Sun) [or exalting the planet to the position of the
Sun]{.underline} (solar hegemony). [Being genuinely terrestrial demands
presupposing the death and pure contingency]{.underline} of the Earth
[in each and every equation]{.underline}, thought, feat of creativity
and political intervention[. Earthly thought em- braces
perishability]{.underline} (i.e. cosmic contingency) as its immanent
core. [If the embracing of Earth's perishability should be posited as
the hallmark of earthly thought, it is because such perishabil-
ity]{.underline} -- as argued earlier -- [grasps the openness of Earth
towards the cosmic exteriority]{.underline} not in terms of
concomitantly vitalistic / [necrocratic correla- tions]{.underline} (as
the Earth's relationship with the Sun) [but alternative ways of dying
and loosening into the cosmic abyss]{.underline}. By the word
'alternative', we mean those [ways of exteriorization and loosening
which are not dictated by the economical correlation between Earth and
Sun. These alternative ways of binding cosmic exteriority or loosening
into the abyss entail, firstly, a terrestrial ecology]{.underline} for
which both Earth and Sun are bound or grasped as merely contingent and
[hence, necessarily per- ishable entities]{.underline}. The [only true
terrestrial ecology, for this reason, is the one founded on the unilat-
eral nature of cosmic contingency against which there is no chance of
resistance --]{.underline} there are [only opportunities for drawing
schemes of complicity.]{.underline} To this extent, [terrestrial thought
and creativ- ity must essentially be associated with
ecology]{.underline}, but an [ecology which is based on the unilateral
powers of cosmic contingencies]{.underline} such as climate changes,
singularity drives, chemical eruptions and material disintegration. [Any
other mode of thought basking in the visual effects of Earth as a blue
marble or the Sun as the exorbitant flame is but submission to
heliocentric slavery.]{.underline}

### Econ

#### The affirmative's economic foundations are mistaken -- they rely on the concept of the restricted economy and efficiency, when instead we should prefer the general economy and waste.

"Georges Bataille: On His Shoulders (And Other Parts of the Body of
Knowledge", "On the Shoulders of Giants" \| rpadhi

The key argument of this first volume is that all dynamic, developing
systems have two aspects to them, one limited and one general. Even
though Bataille was primarily interested in systems of human action,
here he ventures much further and includes both cosmological and
biological systems in his sweeping analysis of the logic of systems.
[Discussing economy (broadly understood), he begins by pointing out that
most studies have completely misunderstood the foundational aspect of
this system. Most theorists of economy start from the assumption that
its key logic is one of efficiency. One thus assumes that things such as
the conservation of energy, the parsimonious use of resources and
savings -- things we often state as positive and "economic" things to do
-- are natural and basic for economic functioning. Bataille disagrees in
the most violent manner possible.]{.underline} Presaging modern economic
anthropology, he instead turns the entire question on its head. [If we
look back to the very birth of the economy, the moment in which society
started forming around productive functions, what actually
occurred?]{.underline} As Marshall Sahlins later showed to great e ect
in his Stone Age Economics (1972), the state of primitive man was not
one of dearth. [Instead it seems that our ancestors lived fairly
pleasant lives, with limited time spent on anything like work due to
their very limited needs. With few people in the world, and food thus
being plentiful and relatively easy to gather or hunt, work and means
were minimized as there were no real ends to pursue.]{.underline} It is
here that Bataille enters the picture. How did we develop culture and
economy? Not because we had to, as we might well have opted to live in a
pre-historical bliss. [No, we developed because we desired something
more -- something that Bataille calls the accursed share. We desired
feasts, fetish-objects, larger huts, bigger prey, rituals and
merrymaking. For some this seems normal, as we're programmed to
understand progress and development as something natural and necessary.
But Bataille points out that this is a very peculiar assumption, and
that all these things can in fact be understood more analytically as
"waste". Looking to a wide range of anthropological evidence, Bataille
argues that progress isn't driven by some natural necessity, but rather
by the tendency of all systems to create great eruptions of energy,
magnificent waste and sacred excess.]{.underline} I will simply state,
without waiting further, that [**the extension of economic growth itself
requires the overturning of economic principles--the overturning of the
ethics that ground them.** Changing from the perspectives of restrictive
economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican
transformation: a reversal of thinking -- and of ethics]{.underline}.
From e Accursed Share, Vol. 1 (1949/1988: 25) [We didn't need to start
storing grain, but did so because we wanted to organize huge drunken
feasts in which our saved surplus could be gloriously wasted (and during
which we ourselves could get wasted]{.underline} -- as archaeological
research has convincingly shown [that the first instances of farming
were not for the production of necessities but for producing beer and
thus drunkenness).]{.underline} We developed complex logistics in order
to lay our hands on trinkets and frivolities such as gold and spices.
[We built societies in order to arrange huge events -- such as wars,
huge art galleries or the Olympics -- without apparent purpose. Waste,
nothing but glorious waste! e problem, maintains Bataille, is that we've
assumed that the limited system of economy,]{.underline} the part of it
that strives for effciency and order, is the whole story. No, he
continues, the [general economy is the correct unit of analysis, and
here **effciency and parsimony only exist in order to enable waste and
expenditure**.]{.underline}

#### We must rethink social wealth in terms of intentionally unproductive use -- productive expenditure dominates social life by desacralizing human labor in terms of utility -- an unprecedented break frees us from the oppressive principles of economy

La Part maudite, [Bataille\'s most systematic and long-considered work,
provokes in the reader an inescapable feeling of mingled enthusiasm and
disappointment.]{.underline} There is something striking and gran- diose
about Bataille\'s attempt to subvert existing political economy, caught
within the limits of a utilitarian or calculating rationality, in order
to replace it with a \"general economics\" that would make of
unproductive expenditure (sacrifice, luxury, war, games, sumptuary
monuments) the most determinant phenomenon of social life. [At last a
critique of political economy which, while remaining on the decisive
terrain of the social circulation of wealth, escapes the confined
atmosphere of the bourgeois ethic-so often caricatured-, the cramped and
grayish world of petty calculation, quantifiable profit and industrious
activity! It is the most extravagant waste-gratuitous, careening
consumption, where accumulated wealth is set ablaze and disappears in an
instant, wreathing in ephemeral glory him who makes the offering of this
blaze which becomes the central phenomenon, the one through which a
society discovers itself and celebrates the deepest values that animate
it:]{.underline} its religion, its meta- physics, its sense of the
sacred. Bataille\'s \"Copernican reversal\" of political economy is a
remark- able and dazzling operation of ethnological decentering. [It is
not the store and the workshop, the bank and the factory, that hold the
key from which the principles of the economy can be
deduced.]{.underline} In the blood that spurts from the open chest of
victims sacrificed to the sun in an Aztec ritual, in the sumptuous and
ruinous feasts offered to the courtiers of Versailles by the monarch of
divine right, in all these mad from dissipations is found a secret that
our restricted economics has covered up and caused to be forgotten. [We
must rethink social wealth not from the parsimonious perspective of an
ascetic bourgeoisie that only consents to spend when it expects a
return, but from the point of view]{.underline} (nearly delirious to our
mind) of the erection of the pyramids or the cathedrals[, or of the
sacrifice of thousands of herd animals in archaic holocausts. It is in
this intentionally unproductive use, in this un- limited expenditure,
and not in utilitarian consumption that a secret lies hidden, the
\"general law of the economy\": \"a society always produces on the whole
more than is necessary to its subsistance,]{.underline} it disposes of a
surplus[. It is precisely the use made of this excess that determines
it: the surplus is the cause of disturbances, changes of structure, and
of its entire history.\"\' A thesis that is radically opposed to the
rationalist, productivist and utilitarian vision. It is the mode of
expenditure of the excess, the consumption of the superfluous, this
accursed share, that determines a society\'s form.]{.underline} The
dominant prosaic vision may be only a recently formed prejudice
contemporaneous with the reign of the bourgeoisie, ushered in by the
Reformation, and unable to account for the real and ineluctable movement
of wealth in a society, a movement that sovereignly engages human
beings: their relationship to the sacred through religion, mysticism,
art, eroticism. One cannot deny that this \"general economics\" has a
great force of conviction, the strength of a new critique of political
economy which instead of accepting the notions of this discipline
(market exchange, need, scarcity, work-value) as Marx did, contests the
very meta- physical ground of a utilitarian and productivist rationality
whose limitation becomes evident in the anthropology of archaic
societies. Better still, far from retreating beyond an economic
explanation, as do the spiritualist critiques, this vision generalizes
the economic approach, directly placing in its conceptual field notions
that do not seem to belong there: religion, art, eroticism. [At the
heart of Bataille\'s thought lies the troubling postulate that the
distinction between the profane and the sacred-a fundamental distinction
of all human society-merges in a broad sense from the economic. Whereas
the pro- fane is the domain of utilitarian consumption, the sacred is
the do- main of experience opened by the unproductive consumption of
what is sacrificed. Henceforth the position of religion or art with
respect to the \"economic base\" as formulated by Marx is completely
transformed. The religious or artistic domain is not a simple
superstructure of vague whims built on the economic
infrastructure:]{.underline} it is itself economic, in the sense of a
general economics founded on the expenditure of the excess, on the
unproductive and ecstatic consumption of the surplus, through which the
human being experiences the ultimate meaning of existence. [General
economics, unlike restricted economics, encompasses obliquely the entire
domain of human activities, extending the \"economic\" intelligence to
highly symbolic practices where formidable energies are consumed for the
celebration of the gods, the glory of the great or the dionysiac
pleasure of the humble. What becomes apparent then is the genealogy of
our economic thought.]{.underline} A complete desacralization of life
(inaugurated by Calvinism and carried to its limit by Marxism) was
necessary for the world of production and exchange to become autonomous
according to the principle of restricted utility. The profane and
prosaic reality thought by contemporary economics can be constituted
only by excluding outside the field of human activity-through the total
secu- larization of ethical values-any impulse toward sacrifice, toward
consumption as pure loss. [Bataille is thus proposing a veritable
anthropology of history whose guiding thread would be the accursed share
and which would achieve a unification of the two forces that have been
considered individually the motors of human societies (religion and
economics). But this history is marked by a break. Until the birth of
capitalism every society is one of sacrificial expenditure.]{.underline}
Whether in the potlatch of primitive tribes described by Mauss in The
Gift, the bloody sacrifices of the Aztecs, the building of the Egyptian
pyramids, or even the opposing paths of peaceful Tibetan lamaism and
warlike Islamic conquest, the expenditure of excess is always inscribed
within a principle of the sacred. [With the birth of the bourgeois world
a radical change takes place. Productive expenditure now entirely
dominates social life. In a desacralized world, where human labor is
guided in the short or long term by the imperative of utility, the
surplus has lost its meaning of glorious consumption and becomes capital
to be reinvested productively, a constantly multiplying
surplus-value.]{.underline} In my view it is in this historical outcome
that the most serious difficulty lies. This is also undoubtedly
Bataille\'s view: he always wanted to continue his first sketch but this
continuation exists only in fragments. On the one hand, there is hardly
any doubt that Bataille always harbored a will to subvert contemporary
society, a will that was heightened by his searing contact with
surrealism and politically engaged groups. On the other hand, it is
clear that the discussions in La Part maudite concerning \"the present
facts\" of the world situation in terms of general economics are more
than disappointing. Every- thing suggests that Bataille was unable to
articulate his mysticism of expenditure, of sovereignty, of major
communication-expressed so flamboyantly in La Somme Atheologique,
L\'Erotisme or La Litterature et le mal-in terms of contemporary general
economics. Where do we situate Bataille\'s claim? What happens to the
demand of the sacred in capitalist society? [How do we reconcile the
affirmation that capitalism represents an unprecedented break with all
archaic (precapitalist) forms of expenditure and the postulate of the
necessary universality of spending as pure loss? This is the
difficulty.]{.underline} Bataille wants to maintain as a general
anthropological principle the necessity of unproductive expenditure
while simultaneously upholding the historic singularity of capitalism
with regard to this expenditure. Bourgeois society corresponds to a
\"general atrophy of former sumptuary processes\" (41). An anomaly
whereby loss is not absent (which would contradict the general
principle) but virtually unreadable: [\"Today, the great and free social
forms of unproductive expenditure have disappeared. Nevertheless, we
should not conclude from this that the very principle of expenditure is
no longer situated at the end of economic activity\" (37). So what
happens to ostentatious expenditure in capitalism]{.underline}? And can
we really believe, furthermore, that the even more radical
desacralization effected by communism could become a libertarian
affirmation of sovereignty-the feast of self-consciousness, without
divinities and myths?

#### General economies suppress energy by expending and erupting it into uncontrolled explosions, e.g. war -- instead, social consumption resuscitates nonproductive expenditures, creating a modern ritual potlatch

**Yang, 2k** (Yang, Mayfair Mei‐hui, Professor of Religious Studies and

Barbara, and Professor and Director of Asian Studies at the University
of Sydney, Australia, "Putting Global Capitalism in Its Place: Economic

[Bataille's project called for widening the frame of our economic
inquiry to what he called a general economy, which
accounted]{.underline} not only [for]{.underline} such things as
production, trade, and finance but also for **[social
consumption]{.underline}**, of which ritual and religious sacrifice,
feasting, and festival were important components in precapitalist
economies. [In Bataille's approach, religion was not an epiphenomenal
derivative of the infrastructures of production but an economic activity
in itself. A general economy treats economic wealth and growth as part
of the operations of the law of physics governing the global field of
energy for all organic phenomena, so that, when any organism accumulates
energy in excess of that needed for its subsistence, this energy must be
expended and dissipated in some way.]{.underline} What he proposed in
his enigmatic and mesmerizing book The Accursed Share was that, in our
modern capitalist productivism, we have lost sight of this fundamental
law of physics and material existence: that the surplus energy and
wealth left over after the basic conditions for subsistence,
reproduction, and growth have been satisfied must be expended. [If this
energy is not destroyed, **it will erupt of its own in an uncontrolled
explosion such as war.** Given the tremendous productive power of modern
industrial society and the fact that its productivist ethos has cut off
virtually all traditional avenues of ritual and festive expenditures,
energy surpluses have been redirected to military expenditures for
modern warfare on a scale unknown in traditional societies. Bataille
thought that the incessant growth machine that is the post-World War II
U.S. economy could be deflected from a catastrophic expenditure on
violent warfare only **by potlatching the entire national
economy.**]{.underline} In giving away its excess wealth to poorer
nations, as in the Marshall Plan to rebuild war-torn Europe, the United
States could engage in a nonmilitary rivalry for prestige and influence
with the Soviet Union, that other center of industrial modernity's
radical reduction of nonproductive expenditure.14 **[Thus, Bataille
wished to resuscitate an important dimension of the economy,
nonproductive expenditure, that has all but disappeared in both
capitalist and state socialist modernity.]{.underline}** Scholars such
as Jean-Joseph Goux (1998) have pointed to a troubling overlap between
Bataille's views on luxury and sacrificial expenditure and postmodern
consumer capitalism. [Consumer capitalism is also predicated on massive
consumption and waste rather than on the thrift, asceticism, and
accumulation against which Ba- 14. It is estimated that the Marshall
Plan cost 2% of the U.S. gross national product annually from 1947 to
1951 (\$160 billion a year in today's terms), in comparison with which
the tiny amounts proposed today to forgive Third World debt (\$600
million) and rebuild Kosovo and Albania (\$5 billion) seem laughable
(Sanger 1999). It exhibits potlatch features in the tendency for
businesses to give goods away in the hope that "supply creates its own
demand"; it collapses the distinction between luxury and useful goods
and between need and desire (Goux 1998).]{.underline} Unlike modernist
capitalism, postmodern consumer capitalism is driven by consumption
rather than production. Thus, Bataille's vision of the ritual
destruction of wealth as defying the principles of accumulative and
productive capitalism does not address this different phase of consumer
capitalism, whose contours have only become clear since his death in
1962. It seems to me that despite their overt similarities, the
principles of ritual consumption and those of consumer capitalism are
basically incompatible. [If Bataille had addressed our consumer society
today, he would have said that this sort of consumption is still in the
service of production and productive accumulation, since every act of
consumption in the world of leisure,]{.underline} entertainment, media,
fashion, and home de´cor merely [feeds back into the growth of the
economy rather than leading to the finality and loss of truly
nonproductive expenditure.]{.underline} Even much of modern warfare is
no longer truly destructive but tied into the furthering of
military-industrial production. Nor, despite its economic excesses, does
our consumer culture today challenge the basic economic logic of
rational private accumulation as a self-depleting archaic sacrificial
economy does.15 Furthermore[, capitalist consumption is very much an
individual consumption rather than one involving the whole community or
social order.]{.underline}

#### We must confront the fissures of capitalist consumption -- by doing so we will reevaluate our orientation towards expenditure 

**Yang, 2k** (Yang, Mayfair Mei‐hui, Professor of Religious Studies and
East Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, and Professor and Director of Asian Studies at the University
of Sydney, Australia, "Putting Global Capitalism in Its Place: Economic

Here [a consumer economy has been incorporated into ritual exuberance
and generosity but in a way which undercuts the private accumulation of
capitalist consumerism with the ethics of a relational kinship order of
reciprocity and obligation linking different communities together across
space.]{.underline} In this meshing of ritual and consumer economies,
the question arises whether this is an example of the latter's
colonizing and penetrating the former. Since this is still a Third World
society not fully extricated from the economic privations and emphasis
on asceticism, discipline, and production that were the hallmarks of a
modernist state socialism, [more features of modernist capitalist
culture are found alongside consumer culture in Wenzhou than in the
modern West today.]{.underline} In other words, modernist features of
the Maoist era have combined with the structural emphasis on capital
accumulation and investment as rural Wenzhou enters a new phase of
constructing factories and infrastructure. In this situation, **[a more
likely scenario than consumer capitalism's hijacking ritual consumption
is the revived ritual economy's taking advantage of the opening
introduced by postmodernist consumer capitalism to make inroads against
the combined modernist forces of state socialist]{.underline}** and
early capitalist productivism and desacralization. **[Here the
postmodern consumer economy,]{.underline}** which requires the free flow
of commerce, **[is enlisted as an ally by the ritual economy in its
eluding of state control.]{.underline}** This is a parallel movement to
Arturo Escobar's (1999:14) suggestion that [the "organic regime of
nature"]{.underline} (small-scale preindustrial cultivation which avoids
a nature/culture opposition) [can join forces with the postmodern
capitalist "technonature regime"]{.underline} (whose stance toward
nature is one of conservation and promotion of biodiversity) [in an
alliance to counter the ravages of a modernist capitalism which treats
nature as a commodified object and resource. In this consumer-ritual
economy hybrid, the ritual economy continues to present the danger of
breaking out fully and realizing its deep destructive force, of which
the burning of real money and paper replicas of goods at funerals
provides just a hint.]{.underline} Should the state further relax its
vigilance over ritual and productive accumulation reach a certain point
of saturation, an outbreak of ritual expenditure and material waste and
destruction such as a bonfire of real consumer appliances at an
extravagant funeral is not inconceivable. Once unleashed, [the internal
principles of rural Wenzhou's economy of kinship and expenditure could
challenge and subvert the principles of rational productivism and
private accumulation of global capitalism. As capital and capitalist
practices expand across the globe, our theoretical tools seem inadequate
to capture the full complexity of these processes, especially for rural
areas.]{.underline} Rather than assuming that capitalism immediately
transforms and converts everything it encounters, [**it is necessary to
consider the different modes and logics that it must incorporate and the
fissures and tensions between them.** A notion of economic hybridity is
conducive to the genealogical task of tracing the historical process of
cross-fertilization and fusion that has brought different economic
practices and logics together into a multiplex form.]{.underline} We
must not presume that capitalism is everywhere so impregnable that it is
not altered in its forays around the world.28 By taking into account the
continued operation of precapitalist logics of expenditure within modern
hybrid economies, rather than reducing the contradictions of capitalism
to a mechanism internal to the structures of capitalist production, we
open the way to addressing an issue that Marx's concern with
reorganizing production neglected**[: the horror of endless material
accumulation and productivism.]{.underline}** It is true that
[capitalism has its own mechanisms of periodic self-destruction of its
accumulation]{.underline}, a sort of "clearing of inventory" [such as
the military's expenditure of its stockpiles of weapons in warfare and
the stock market crashes which wipe out accumulated wealth in a matter
of seconds. **Bataille's point is that there are better ways of
consuming wealth so as to restrain the insane expansion of the system
and live more lightly on the earth---giving out rather than raking in.
What principles of ritual expenditure can do at the local level is to
redistribute wealth between families through an ethic of competition in
generosity, build up the cohesiveness of local communities and give them
more autonomy against the centralized state and transnational
capitalism, and prevent the reduction of existence to a utilitarian
definition.**]{.underline} At the global level, a ritual economic logic
may help deflect capitalist accumulation into a rivalry between
transnational corporations and states over which of them dares to
sacrifice a greater proportion of its annual profits or GNP by giving it
away to causes that do not feed back into production.

### Educational Competitiveness

#### Their investment in meritocracy instills a binary between what is useful and useless. This lens of productivity necessitates the devaluation of individuals 

**Sennett 06 (Richard, Centennial Professor of Sociology at the London
School of Economics and University Professor of the Humanities at New
York University. "The Culture of New Capitalism", Chapter 2: Talent and
the Specter of Uselessness, p 122-125, 2006) // IES**

[The formulation of potential ability leads back to the relation between
talent and the specter of uselessness]{.underline}, a relationship which
looks different once [we have described the kind of knowledge which is
now useful, particularly at the cutting edge of the
economy]{.underline}. The French philosopher Michel Foucault was the
modern era's great analyst of the ways [knowledge enables certain forms
of power.]{.underline} He had in view the development of [increasingly
elaborated, dense knowledge which would serve the purpose of ever more
complete control over individuals and groups; for instance, the
development of psychiatry was in his view intimately linked to the
spread of institutions of incarceration]{.underline}.13 [The Foucaultian
scheme does not envisage superficial knowledge as a tool of power, and
in this way does not quite describe the way potential ability is sought
and practiced in modern meritocracy]{.underline}. But he illuminated an
all-important fact about [meritocracy]{.underline}: it [disempowers the
larger majority of those who fall under its rule]{.underline}. When
Michel Young coined the term [meritocracy]{.underline} he
[meant]{.underline} to dramatize, painting crudely, [a society in which
a small number of skilled people can control an entire
society.]{.underline} Foucault made a more detailed picture of this
domination; [the elite would get under the skin of the masses by making
them feel that they did not understand themselves, that they were
inadequate interpreters of their own experience of life. Tests of
potential ability show just how deeply under the skin a knowledge system
can cut.]{.underline} [Judgments about potential ability are much more
personal in character than judgments of achievement]{.underline}. An
achievement compounds social and economic circumstances, fortune and
chance, with self. [Potential ability focuses only on the
self.]{.underline} The statement "you lack potential" is much more
devastating than "you messed up." [It makes a more fundamental claim
about who you are. It conveys uselessness in a more profound
sense]{.underline}. Just because the statement is devastating,
organizations engaged in continual internal talent searches tend to
avoid saying it outright. Personnel managers often soften the blow by
talking about the varied abilities in every human being which may pass
through the net of examinations, etc. etc. More finely, as in some
finance firms in London, judgments of potential ability tend to be
informal, senior management acting on gut feeling about their juniors'
potential as much as on the objective trading record; year-end bonuses
may be awarded in ways which resemble the ancient Roman practice of
divining the future from the entrails of dead animals. The sting of
being left behind, of being unrewarded, is stronger in these firms than
in investment banks, where either the bonus or [future prospects are
simply calculated]{.underline} by the trading record. [**The untalented
become invisible**, they simply drop from view in institutions covertly
judging ability rather than achievement.]{.underline} Here again
**[organizations mirror what people]{.underline}** may have
**[experience]{.underline}**d earlier in life [**at school**. Youngsters
judged to be without talent do not stand out as distinctive individuals,
they become a collective body, a mass. **Meritocracy**]{.underline}, as
Young understood, [**is a system as well as an idea, a system based on
institutional indifference** once a person is judged]{.underline}.14 The
problem is compounded, as Gardner has shown, just because the talent
searches do not try to cast a wide net, paralleling the diverse kinds of
abilities diverse individuals may possess; [the search for potential
ability is narrow-focus]{.underline}. School and work differ in one
crucial way about the process. Though in principle there should be
nothing a student could do about his or her innate ability, in
well-known fact it is possible with sufficient tutoring to raise scores
significantly in retaking the tests. In the work world, on the contrary,
there are seldom second chances. In flexible organizations, employee
records constitute the one hard possession of the firm. In studying one
set of such records, I was struck by how little revision the personnel
manager had made over time to individual case files; the first judgments
instead set the standard, later entries sought for consistency;
translation of the records into numeric form usable by core managers
only made the documents more rigid in content. The belief of many
workers let go or held back in work that they have been judged unfairly
illustrates another dimension of judgmental power, one which again does
not fit into Foucault's scheme. Those who are discarded are often
correct interpreters of their experience: they have not indeed been
judged fairly, on the basis of their achievements. The sense of being
unfairly judged comes from the ways in which firms themselves are run.
To understand why, we might recall some of the idealized traits of a
worker in the cuttingedge institution. An organization in which the
contents are constantly shifting requires the mobile capacity to solve
problems; getting deeply involved in any one problem would be
dysfunctional, since projects end as abruptly as they begin. [The
problem analyzer who can move on, whose product is possibility, seems
more attuned to the instabilities which rule the global
marketplace.]{.underline} The social skill required by a flexible
organization is the ability to work well with others in short-lived
teams, others you won't have the time to know well. Whenever the team
dissolves and you enter a new group, the problem you have to solve is
getting down to business as quickly as possible with these new
teammates. "I can work with anyone" is the social formula for potential
ability. It won't matter who the other person is; in fast-changing firms
it can't matter. Your skill lies in cooperating, whatever the
circumstances. [These qualities of the ideal self are a source of
anxiety because disempowering to the mass of workers.]{.underline} As we
have seen, in the workplace they produce social deficits of loyalty and
informal trust, they erode the value of accumulated experience. To which
we should now add the hollowing out of ability. A key aspect of
craftsmanship is learning how to get something right. Trial and error
occurs in improving even seemingly routine tasks; the worker has to be
free to make mistakes, then go over the work again and again. Whatever a
person's innate abilities, that is, skill develops only in stages, in
fits and starts---in music, for instance, even the child prodigy will
become a mature artist only by occasionally getting things wrong and
learning from mistakes. In a speeded-up institution, however,
time-intensive learning becomes difficult. The pressures to produce
results quickly are too intense; as in educational testing, so in the
workplace time-anxiety causes people to skim rather than to dwell. Such
hollowing out of ability compounds the organizations' tendency to
discount past achievement in looking toward the future. When people have
spoken to me about not being able to show what they can do, I've sensed
they are referring to just this sense of being prevented from developing
their skills. When I interviewed back-office workers in a health
maintenance organization, for instance, they complained that the time
pressures meant they did a "middling" job of making sense of the
accounts; people who worked quickly were rewarded with promotion, but
the bills they processed proved frequently a muddle on closer
inspection. In call centers, management similarly frowns on employees
who spend too much time on the telephone---too responsive, for instance,
to fuddled customers who can't express themselves clearly. Anyone who
has spent time at a budgetairline ticket counter knows the problem:
impatience is institutionalized. In principle, any well-run firm should
want its employees to learn from their mistakes and admit a certain
degree of trial-and-error learning. In practice, such big firms do not.
The size of the firm indeed makes the greatest difference in this
regard: in small service firms (under a hundred or so employees) care of
customers is more directly connected to the firms' survival. But in the
large medical insurance company superficiality proved functional; taking
too much time to straighten things out earned no rewards. The result,
within the firms I and my colleagues studied---perhaps invisible to a
frustrated customer---was a fair number of employees who also feel
frustrated. In sum, [**the material specter of uselessness lifts the
curtain on a fraught cultural drama**. How can one become valuable and
useful in the eyes of others? The classic way in which people do so is
the craftsman's way, by developing some special talent, some particular
skill. The claims of craftsmanship are challenged in modern culture by
an alternative formula of value. In its origin, meritocracy sought to
offer opportunity to individuals with exceptional
ability]{.underline}---Jefferson's "[natural aristocracy]{.underline}."
It took on an ethical cast in arguing that such people deserved
opportunity; it was a matter of justice that society provide for them.
In the beginning, this search pitted one elite against another, the
natural aristocracy against inherited privilege. In the course of time
society has refined the technology of searching for unusual talent. In
prospecting for the potential to grow rather than for past achievement,
[the search for talent well suits the peculiar conditions of flexible
organizations. These organizations use the same instruments for a larger
purpose: **to eliminate as well as promote**
**individuals**.]{.underline} The invidious comparisons between people
become deeply personal. In this talent cull, [those judged without inner
resources are left in limbo. They can be judged no longer useful or
valuable]{.underline}, despite what they have accomplished.

### Health 

#### The world, people, information, and our biological makeup are all inextricably intertwined with the production of excess value. Rather than unproductively expend that excess, moves towards cartographic sanitization such as the AFF are only a futile attempt to manage it, reign it in, and deny the chaotic forces of life itself

New York City, with research interests in pessimism, nihilism,
continental philosophy, and antihumanism. "The Global Genome:
Biotechnology, Politics, and Culture", Chapter 3: A Political Economy of
the Genomic Body, p 122-130, 2005) //**

Thus far, I have noted how [contemporary genomics undertakes a
particular organization of the bioinformatics body, through the
incorporation of informatic tropes]{.underline} and in the design of
"wet" and "dry" databases.54 If [such practices dictate what will be
designed into a genome database]{.underline}, then **[we can ask how the
political economy of genetic bodies in genomic mapping is also a set of
organizational technologies based on the management of elements of
excess]{.underline}**. Georges [Bataille's concept of general economy
provides a helpful way of considering genomics not just as a political
economy, but as a general economy in which excess, not scarcity, is the
rule]{.underline}. For Bataille, writing during the same period in which
the structure of DNA was elucidated, [traditional political economy
represented a narrow mode of social analysis that often reduced the
range of activity within the social field to utility, production,
accumulation, and conservation]{.underline}.55 Stemming from a long
history of dissatisfaction with Marxism and Hegelianism, [Bataille's
thought outlines a trajectory that explores]{.underline}---in
philosophy, in poetry, in political activism, in occultism, in
pornography, in anthropology---[the "negative" ways in which given
social formations articulate themselves as productive, homogeneous
structures]{.underline}. Bataille's almost obsessive interest in the
visceral, abject body, what he often termed "base materialism," has to
do with the various means by which a tension-filled relationship was
established between a potentially threatening, transgressive body
(obscene, grotesque, unstable, dysfunctional) and the particular mode of
social organization within which such bodies were found.56 In other
words, [Bataille's base materialism is not about positing the
transgressive body at a position of absolute exteriority to the social,
but neither does its complex contingency simply predetermine it to a
recuperation by discourse. The social formation does not simply repress
or forbid the transgressive body; but neither does this body form the
core of social hegemony. The social must---reluctantly, frustratedly,
and even hesitantly---engage with this difficult, "dirty" body through a
variety of means. It]{.underline} [was central to Bataille's
project]{.underline}, then, [to consider the types of relationships
between the productive dynamics of "homogeneous" society and the
troubling excesses of "heterogeneous" bodies]{.underline}: "The very
term [**heterogeneous indicates that it concerns elements that are
impossible to assimilate; this impossibility**, which has a fundamental
impact on social assimilation, likewise has an impact on scientific
assimilation]{.underline} . . . as a rule**, [science cannot know
heterogeneous elements]{.underline}** as such . . [. the heterogeneous
world includes everything resulting from unproductive
expenditure]{.underline}."57 A key methodological move in this
consideration was a reconfiguration of the field of political economy.
Rather than considering the social from perspectives privileging
utility, production, and conservation, [Bataille attempts to analyze the
social body as a kind of sociological metabolism, or as a
wastemanagement system]{.underline}. That is, [rather than consider
political economy from the vantage point of utility, Bataille instead
begins from the vantage point of uselessness and excess]{.underline}.
For this reason, commodities do not form the center of modes of exchange
for Bataille; instead, [objects and instances form a unique mode of
exchange based not on conservation or agglomeration, but on expenditure:
jewels, poetry, festivals, war, eroticism, sacrifice, flowers. Abundance
comes first, not scarcity]{.underline}. Only in the specific historical
instance of capitalism are abundance and exuberance turned back on
themselves. Noting this shift in perspective in Bataille's thought,
Steven Shaviro suggests that "what needs to be explained is no longer
the fact that spontaneous acts of expenditure, like sacrifices or gifts,
also turn out to serve useful purposes for the people who perform them,
but rather the fact that an economy entirely given over to utilitarian
calculation, or to 'rational choice,' still continues to express . . .
the delirious logic of unproductive expenditure."58 [Such a theory must
take into account the languages, structures, and sociohistorical
contingencies of the organizational tactics of modes of social
organization themselves. This perspective---that of a "general
economy"---would work within but pass between the interstices of a
"restricted economy," disallowing internal critical
perspective.]{.underline}59 [Bataille's premise is at once biological,
ontological, and economic: "The living organism, in a situation
determined by the play of energy on the surface of the globe, ordinarily
receives more energy than is necessary for maintaining life; the excess
energy (wealth) can be used for the growth of the system (e.g., an
organism); **if the system can no longer grow, or if the excess cannot
be completely absorbed in its growth, it must necessarily be lost
without profit; it must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or
catastrophically**."]{.underline} 60 If a restricted economy---the
political economy of Mill, Ricardo, and Smith---is primarily concerned
with the state's use of its resources, then a general economy would
begin from the opposite position and consider social activity that
implicitly challenges and goes outside of the state. [This general
economy thus asks two primary questions: How does a particular social
formation interact with its "accursed share" (those elements that do not
stand in a direct, productive relation to the social formation), and, To
what degree are those elements of excess contingent upon their being
situated within the social formation in which they are
found]{.underline} (is there an element or dynamic to them that is not
simply recuperated into production or affirmation)? The general
trajectory of such an approach would be to question the ways in which
both the inclusive and the exclusive are constitutive of the social
formation. What does Bataille's general economy mean for contemporary
biotech fields such as genomics? [If we approach genomics as an activity
that rearticulates the body at the genetic and informatic levels, then
it would seem that **genomics is as much about the management of
excess**]{.underline} [("junk" or noncoding DNA) as it is about the
organization of scarcity (coding DNA).]{.underline} In one sense, it
goes without saying that [the centrality of the mapping of the human
genome constitutes one of the foundational fields within genetics and
biotech research.]{.underline} Gene therapy, new reproductive
technologies (NRTs), **[pharmacogenomics, medical technology, pathology,
immunology, and a host of related fields are to varying degrees
dependent on the promises, claims, and current implementations of the
research performed in genomics]{.underline}**. [Part of this dependency
requires that basic research produce as much data as possible to ensure
accurate results]{.underline} (in the case of genome mapping) [and to
ensure application (in the case of drug development or preclinical
trials).]{.underline} In a sense, [the excess of genomic
data]{.underline}---SNPs, introns, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and
so on--- [does not simply exist, but is actually produced by genomics
technologies]{.underline}. [If we look at current genomics]{.underline},
not in terms of official science (e.g., the progressive march toward the
complete cataloging of the human genome), but rather [in terms of
Bataille's excess]{.underline}, then our examples demonstrate the degree
to which **[the political economy of genomics is primarily concerned
with the production and subsequent technical management of
excess]{.underline}**. But an excess of what exactly? If [both the
technology of genomics and its preliminary findings are considered, it
is clear that the excess that is managed is an excess of biological
information]{.underline}---though, note, not necessarily an excess of
biological "life itself." As we have seen, examples of genomics
technologies of excess include the statistical management of
polymorphisms, or SNPs; the overproduction of DNA in tools such as
oligonucleotide synthesizers; the study of junk DNA, or intron regions
in the genome; and, finally, the challenges of establishing computer
database ontology standards in XML. [As a general economy---that is, as
a political economy based on excess---genomics becomes defined according
to a range of practices that involve the ongoing production and
management of the inclusive and exclusive elements in the genomic
body.]{.underline}The Insubordination of Matter This chapter has
considered the ways in which [genomics forms a flexible management of
excess DNA (or information]{.underline}) from the perspective of Marx's
critiques of political economy and [from the perspective of Bataille's
notion of a general economy. Genomics and its related fields perform
this management]{.underline} not only through positive means
(textualizing, universalizing, creating causality, constructing), but
also **[through negative means (individualizing and grouping; managing
excess) that define further data for genomic analysis.]{.underline}**
Both Marx and Bataille pose a set of challenges to the conceptual
underpinning of political economy. If we consider political economy in
this way (that is, philosophically), then it is not difficult to
understand how [the **particular modes of production, distribution, and
consumption help to define what is or is not valuable or useful** in
biotechnology fields such as genomics.]{.underline} As Lev Manovich
states with regard to the role of the database in new media, What we
encounter here is an example of the general principle of new media: the
projection of the ontology of a computer onto culture itself. If in
physics the world is made of atoms and in genetics it is made of genes,
computer programming encapsulates the world according to its own logic.
The world is reduced to two kinds of software objects which are
complementary to each other: data structures and algorithms. . . .
\[A\]ny object in the world---be it the population of a city, or the
weather over the course of a century, a chair, a human brain---is
modeled as a data structure, i.e. data organized in a particular way for
efficient search and retrieval. Fields such as genomics are unique,
however, because they do not simply reiterate the abstraction of the
material world into an immaterial data structure. In genomics, as noted,
a database logic pervades both the wet-lab maintenance of BAC libraries
and the more familiar construction of computer databases such as
GenBank. In other words, an informatic mode of organization---an
informatic mode of "banking"---spans both the material and immaterial
aspects of biology. This dual aspect of genomics, of being at once
material and informatic, is key for an understanding of how [the
characteristics of a genetic reductionism defines the molecular-genetic
understanding of "life itself." The artifacts of the
database]{.underline}, the BAC library, the intron, and GEML [contribute
to this general notion that biological "life itself" is in some way
identical to "information."]{.underline} And yet, as a number of authors
have pointed out, this equivalence is always inexact, for the genetic
"code" is not a language---it has no grammar, it contains no
information, and it transfers no message separate from a medium.
Something always seems to escape: on the one hand, there is the
precision of sequences and structures, where a single base-pair
polymorphism can result in a disease, yet, on the other hand, there is a
high degree of "redundancy" in the sequence and a panoply of
"error-correcting" mechanisms in the genetic code. [Whereas
Marx,]{.underline} in the Grundrisse[, points to the central tension
between labor and capital as the motor of industrial capitalism,
**Bataille translates this tension into one between expenditure and
accumulation**]{.underline}. For Marx, it is "living labor" that always
provides the challenge to capital and to which capital responds either
through technological advances in production (e.g., the fixed capital of
machinery) or through redefining the relationship between labor and
machinery. Regarding this "appropriation of living labor by objectified
labor,"62 Marx points to the transformation of living labor into a
technology of living labor, a transformation of nature into a technology
of nature: "Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways,
electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human
industry."63 Yet---and this point is the key to understanding the
uniqueness of biotechnology today--- [capitalism's revolutions of
production are able to reconceive of biology and of nature itself as a
technology]{.underline}: "In machinery, the appropriation of living
labor by capital achieves a direct reality in this respect as well: It
is, firstly, the analysis and application of mechanical and chemical
laws, arising directly out of science, which enables the machine to
perform the same labor as that previously performed by the worker."64
Although Marx is speaking here of industrial manufacturing, [it is not
difficult to expand his comments to the biotech industry, in which we
see the routine manufacture of molecules, enzymes, and
cells]{.underline}. What has changed in the jump from industrial
capitalism to the biotech industry is the role that modern notions of
"information" play in relation to the biological domain. "[Living labor"
is no longer just the labor appropriated by workers, but the uncanny
biomaterial labor of immortalized cell lines, cultured stem cells, DNA
synthesizers, and even transgenic organisms. M]{.underline}arx had
already begun to see this integration of living labor and the "dead
labor" of machinery in biological terms ("the metabolism of capital"),
and in the biotech industry this integration is pushed further still.
However, for Bataille, even Marx's critique of political economy had not
gone far enough. Marx was able to critique the universalist
presuppositions of political economy, but, [for Bataille, political
economy had erred in its understanding of the true nature of the
processes of production, distribution, and consumption]{.underline}.
[Bataille's emphasis on a "general economy" based on excess,
expenditure, and luxury is an attempt to invert further the categories
of traditional political economic thought]{.underline}. From this
perspective, [Marx's tension between labor and capital is converted into
a tension between expenditure and accumulation in capitalist societies.
Instead of Marx's living labor in production, Bataille gives us the
intensive production of a loss in expenditure; instead of Marx's general
formula for capital, in which commodities are always transformed into
money, Bataille gives us a general economy in which the drive for
accumulation takes the form of a reinvestment in production with
profit]{.underline}. [The challenge for an economic system is thus not
how to produce efficiently in order to accrue a surplus value, but
rather how to spend or expend effectively in order to maintain the
dynamic stability of a system. For Bataille, **excess is the problem,
not scarcity**]{.underline} (and in this he gives us a position
diametrically opposed to Malthus and classical political economy). Put
another way, we might say that [for capital the problem is the ongoing
management of excess (pushes toward consumption of immaterial goods and
services; conspicuous consumption; consumption of affects)]{.underline}.
It is tempting to push this idea even further and to suggest that [from
Bataille's perspective of expenditure, **the problem for capital is not
only managing excess, but taking over the production of excess in
itself.**]{.underline} In the biotech industry, genomics and
bioinformatics illustrate this tendency, for in them we see a twofold
tendency. On the one hand, [there is a push toward generating an
incredible amount of information, a "tsunami of data" related to
genomes, proteomes, SNPs, spliceosomes, transcriptomes, biopathways, and
so forth. The first phase of the effort to map the human
genome]{.underline} (by both Celera and the IHGSC) [is the most well
known of such productions of excess.]{.underline} On the other hand,
[the production of such excess has as its primary aim the subsequent
development of mostly computational tools for analyzing and "making
sense" of all this information. The proliferation of bioinformatics
software]{.underline}, DBMSs, genome sequencing computers, [and other
technologies has largely followed upon "Big Science" efforts such as the
HGP]{.underline}. [We have a]{.underline} kind of [pushpull
relationship]{.underline} between these tendencies: [the tendency toward
an excess of data and a tendency toward the management of that excess
(at which time it no longer becomes excess as such).]{.underline} Using
Marx's terms, we can say that [in fields such as genomics and
bioinformatics, information technology subsumes the excess information
(which it has produced)]{.underline}. There is no such thing as "too
much information" for genomics, bioinformatics, or related fields such
as pharmacogenomics. **[There is never too much data, only the
production of an excess that serves to trigger further development of
tools for the management of this excess.]{.underline}** The productive
capacity of this excess can be seen in recent patenting activity
surrounding genetic material: up until 2001, patent applications for
genetic material were being granted without a full knowledge of the
function or specific application of the molecule in question. Genes (or
rather gene derivatives) could theoretically be patented without an
understanding of what the genes did. Only in the U.S. PTO's 2001 Federal
Register Report was it finally specified that patent applicants must
demonstrate "both utility and application" in their files. Yet an
ambiguity still remains concerning knowledge of the function of any
patented compound: "The utility of a claimed DNA sequence does not
necessarily depend on the function of the encoded gene product." In the
network between a laboratory BAC culture, a file in a genome database,
and, perhaps, an application to the U.S. PTO, there is both an effort to
regulate the relationship between labor (or biomaterial labor) and
capital, as well as an effort to manage excess information. [We can ask
Bataille's question of the biotech industry: Is there unproductive
expenditure in biotechnology? In one way, the answer is yes, for the
production or even overproduction of information is increasingly being
seen as one of the major obstacles for bioscience research. In a
different light, the answer is no, for any excess in biotechnology is
not only a production of excess (as in genomics), but an eventually
useful or valuable excess.]{.underline} If this is the case, then [the
general economy of genomics is one in which excess biological "noise" is
constantly managed and transformed into useful or valuable biological
information.]{.underline} The tension between labor and capital in the
biotech industry is therefore a tension between the biomaterial labor of
genes, enzymes, and cells, on the one hand, and the economic imperatives
behind those instances of biotechnology research, on the other hand,
where profit is the primary motivating force. Clearly, this is not the
case with each and every instance of research in fields such as
genomics, proteomics, or bioinformatics. And just as the mere existence
of private-sector funding for research does not immediately imply a
problematic relation between labor and capital, the mere existence of
public or federal funding also does not immediately absolve those
funding bodies of economic imperatives. The difficulty is initially in
understanding how the tension between labor and capital (or between
biomaterial labor and the biotech industry) takes formation in the
so-called biotech century. From this understanding, the next step is to
identify those elements that tip the delicate, fragile balance between
medical and economic interests to one side or the other. These tensions
are often played out at the technical level of BAC libraries,
gene-finding algorithms, and XML standards. Sometimes the prioritization
of economic interests create blockages in bioscience research, as in the
case of proprietary data formats, databases, and software tools in
bioinformatics. At other times, efforts toward the creation of flexible
standards and open source environments can effectively aid in the
research process. We might wonder whether in this biomaterial labor that
is transformed into capital there is still something that escapes,
evades, or bypasses altogether the political economy of genomics. [If
fields such as genomics and bioinformatics are involved in the
production of an excess, that excess is in turn transformed into useful
information, and that information is also valuable information that can
be exchanged. Use and exchange values are coordinated at this level, but
**use values also diverge into the potential medical benefits of drugs
or therapies**. Yet even drugs and therapies require further information
and the development of technologies for diagnostics.]{.underline} As
discussed in chapter 2, this vision of a future, genomics-based medicine
means that the body of the patient is touched only minimally, configured
in a way commensurate with the informatic systems that sample, scan, and
profile. To be fair, however, this overview is far from being the whole
of genomics and bioinformatics research. A number of so-called
alternative approaches have been pursuing the distributed, networked
properties of gene expression, protein-protein interactions, cellular
signaling, and metabolic pathways. This "systems biology" also shows
some overlap in spirit with research in biocomplexity at the Santa Fe
Institute, for instance.65 Although the technologies and methodologies
are new, the basic idea is not: as Evelyn Fox Keller reminds us, the
history of molecular biology and biochemistry already pointed to the
inherently "complex" and networked property of "life itself" at the
molecular and genetic levels.66 Alternative approaches merely remind us
of what is implicit in the history of biological thought itself:
relationality, flexibility, robustness, adaptation. Even the "official"
HGP cannot help but to acknowledge certain excessive elements in the
genome: a relatively modest number of genes (some 3 percent of the
genome), an extremely small difference between the genomes of one
individual and another (approximately 0.1 percent), an incredibly large
number of "short tandem repeat" sequences, and entire "continents" that
seem to have no known function at all (more than 50 percent of the total
genome). In a sense, [despite the biotech industry's efforts to manage
the genome, **the genome itself (like "life itself") appears to be
nothing but excess information**, with all the contradictions that the
phrase implies. Bataille proposes that an organism always produces more
than it needs and that, from a systemswide ecological perspective,
abundance, not scarcity, is the rule of life. With regard to fields such
as genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics, it is not difficult to
begin to wonder whether **the human genome is a noneconomic relation
between labor and capital, between expenditure and
accumulation.**]{.underline}

#### The disease crisis rhetoric of the AFF is the perfection of the project of securitization, a preservation of the body politic against the threatening biological death they claim looms on the horizon. Vaccines are the new weapons of the state of emergency - entire populations are subjected to control and surveillance in the name of the Good.

Within such a context, in what ways [are the biopolitical concerns
expressed by government agencies]{.underline} (such as the BWC) over a
"genetic bomb" [themselves weapons, under the guise of "national
security"?]{.underline} A more cynical rephrasing of this question might
suggest that we will never, in fact, see the kind of biological weapons
of which the BWC speaks. Instead, [what we will see is the use of **this
rhetoric of crisis, the political structure of the exception, and a
biopolitical targeting of the body to gain an unprecedented control over
the nation's population on the medical and genetic levels**. What might
such a near future look like]{.underline}? I conclude this chapter with
three theses, followed by three scenarios. Three Theses Thesis One [The
discourse of biowar is one in which war is biology, and biology is war.
War is biology in the sense that the constitution of the body politic is
as much a concern of national security as the attack on the body politic
from outside forces. The militaristic function of eugenics is to be
found here]{.underline}, but, arguably, it is present in Plato's
Republic, which authorizes selective breeding for the ruling classes.93
But [biology is also war, and there is an equally long tradition of
regarding the medical fight against disease as a war carried out on the
level of cells, germs, and microbes]{.underline}. In modern times,
[anthropologists]{.underline} such as Emily Martin [have analyzed modern
immunology's]{.underline} predilection for [war metaphors in describing
the antibody-antigen response]{.underline}, a metaphor that,
interestingly enough, breaks down in the face of autoimmune diseases
such as those caused by HIV.94 The questions that remain open is how to
do away with the hegemony of war metaphors in relation to biology and
medicine, and whether alternative models---symbiosis, autopoiesis,
network science---can offer a way of doing this. Thesis Two In the
twenty-first century, [national security is increasingly expressed as
the implosion of emerging infectious disease and]{.underline}
[bioterrorism]{.underline}. As noted several times in this chapter, a
defining characteristic of the twenty- first-century response to biowar
has been the nondistinction in policy and legislation between naturally
occurring and artificially occurring instances of biowar. [The operative
term]{.underline} in the plans for Project BioShield in the United
States [is]{.underline} or: [**emerging infectious diseases or
bioterrorism. It matters not which, for the end results are seen to be
the same: the infection and degeneration of the body
politic**.]{.underline} Of course, from the perspective of their causes,
they are very different: whereas emerging infectious diseases ask us to
consider our actions within a network of relations with the environment
globally, bioterrorism challenges us with a fundamentalist view of
biology. Thesis Three [The integration of biotechnology and informatics
in national security concerns culminates in a more general, pervasive
biological security]{.underline}. The 2003 RAND report The Global Threat
of New and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases specifically notes [how
globalization has transformed both biological boundaries and national
boundaries, rendering them vulnerable in terms of infectious
disease.]{.underline}95 [This transformation has prompted the authors to
suggest a shift in policy outlook, from national security
to]{.underline} what they call "[human security]{.underline}." [Whereas
national security places its emphasis on the national population, human
security would place its emphasis on the individual (but the individual
as a participant in an ideal global citizenship). **What seems to be
replacing national security in such examples is a form of biological
security, or a security so pervasive that there is no outside; it is
simply a security against biology, against biological "death itself"**
(the conceptual inverse of biological "life itself"). This biological
security is **the use of biotechnology to defend against biology
itself**, in a kind of surreal war against biology.]{.underline} Genetic
screening, **[preemptive vaccination, new medical
countermeasures]{.underline}**, Web sites posting [disease alerts: the
body is under attack on all fronts,]{.underline} and [in the
confrontation of biology against biology]{.underline} we see the
spectrum of responses, from antibiotics to cosmetic surgery. These three
points---[the discourse of war and biology, the implosion of epidemic
and war, and the notion of biological security---can serve as conceptual
tools for the further analysis of]{.underline} biowar as it exists
alongside [governmental national security, the biotech and
pharmaceutical industries,]{.underline} and the presence of nonstate
terrorist actors. [It is thus not difficult to imagine several possible
scenarios]{.underline}---not doomsday scenarios, but rather scenarios
**[involving an increasing naturalization of the state of emergency that
biowar elicits.]{.underline}** Three Scenarios SimSARS The popular
SimCity games allow players to oversee, manage, and regulate a virtual
city. Using unique algorithms, the player sets certain parameters and
then watches as the complex of events---urban development, financial
transactions, health, crime, education, and so forth---unfold before the
player's eyes. SimCity is predicated on the idea of a complex system:
multiple agencies, multiple factors, and multiple demands, all acting
simultaneously over time (a user can "speed up" time, in which a SimCity
day equals a realtime second). The aim of SimCity is to know how to set
the best starting conditions for the growth of a city, and how and when
to intervene in times of crisis (financial crisis, natural disasters,
rising crime rates, poverty in neighborhoods). Although the player is in
the position of sovereign with respect to the city ([a "God
mode"]{.underline} allows a player to inflict natural disaster, thereby
destroying the city), what SimCity [teaches]{.underline}, above all, is
[a mode of regulation, monitoring, and surveillance]{.underline}. In
fact, formally, SimCity is [very much like the field of epidemiology,
which involves the tracking of, monitoring of, and intervening in the
spread of a particular infectious disease. It is not difficult to
imagine a version]{.underline} of SimCity [based on the control of an
outbreak]{.underline}: SimSARS (SimAIDS would, presumably, be too
complex for most computers). [The player acts as a "virus hunter," or,
better, as the head of a team at the CDC attempting to handle a
potential outbreak]{.underline} of anthrax or Ebola. [In the tradition
of military-training simulations]{.underline}, such a game might be
useful for training personnel at agencies such as the CDC or WHO. But
[in its civilian use it would serve to **normalize further the
heightened level of monitoring and regulation** that the current
"disease surveillance networks" operated by U.S. government agencies
already demonstrate.]{.underline} PGP-DNA If DNA is a code, and if the
encryption and decryption of codes are a key aspect of any military
conflict, then it follows that the most perfect combination of soldier,
weapon, and secret message would be encryption using DNA---in the living
body. Most modern encryption systems involve three basic elements: a
message text (or plaintext), a method of encrypting the plaintext
(cipher), and a means of decrypting the ciphertext (the key). Might it
be possible to encrypt a message into an actual DNA sequence? DNA, being
both remarkably simple (a mere four base pairs) and admirably complex
(endless combinatorics), would serve as an ideal medium for encryption.
With the basic tools of restriction enzymes, plasmids, and gene therapy,
this is not outside the realm of possibility. When the message exists in
the living body, an in vivo ciphertext, it will be indistinguishable
from any other sequence of DNA in the body. A horrific scenario comes to
mind: the ideal suicide bomber is one who is not recognized as such, but
who is carrying a lethal, highly infectious virus during its incubation
period. In the 2001 anthrax attacks, the message and weapon were
delivered together; here, the weapon and the message collapse into one.
"Good" Virus In 2003, the infamous "Blaster" virus worked its way
through the Internet, infecting an estimated 400,000 operating systems
running Microsoft Windows.96 During the attack, [an attempt was made to
construct a countermeasure, a "good" virus, which would, like a computer
virus, propagate itself through the Internet]{.underline}, but instead
of bringing down the computer, it would automatically download a
"Blaster fix" from Microsoft's Web site. Dubbed "Naachi" or "Welchia,"
[this good virus itself ended up causing a fair amount of
damage]{.underline}, affecting the systems of the Air Canada offices and
the U.S. Navy's computer cluster. But the logic of Naachi is
interesting: [fight networks with networks, viruses with viruses. In a
sense, this may be the analogue to the development of inoculation and
vaccination in the nineteenth century]{.underline}. Or, perhaps, we have
not yet seen the biomedical equivalent of Naachi. But it is not
difficult to imagine. [During an outbreak of an infectious disease, what
would be the quickest, most efficient way to administer a vaccine or a
treatment? Hospitals are jammed, doctor's offices overbooked with
appointments, the local drug store out of their supplies. A vaccine can
be inserted into a "disabled" airborne pathogen, thereby spreading its
anecdote against the epidemic. This is, basically, the logic behind gene
therapy. Perhaps a "good" virus is in the making here, using the
networks of infection to spread a vaccine rather than a virus. A kind of
invisible, molecular war would take place in the very air we breathe.
**A decidedly yet ambiguously nonhuman form of medicine under the aegis
of national security.**]{.underline}

### Humanism

#### The aff's project to return to an ethical axiom of humanity will always fail -- humanity is based on the suppression of nature, and it is a justification for domination against communities deemed "animal"

**Rowe 2017** (James, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies and
Cultural, Social, and Political Thought at the University of Victoria.
"Georges Bataille, Chögyam Trungpa, and Radical Transformation:
Theorizing the Political Value of Mindfulness." *The Arrow*. Volume 4,
Issue 2, published April. Accessed 7/13/17, EHL)

Bataille's analysis of domination is rooted in his study of the body,
and the terror and shame human animals can feel before it. e body is
unpredictable: It leaks, expels, hungers, fails, and ultimately dies.
[Our bodies are our opening to life, but also to death. And
this]{.underline} inevitable death se[ems to suggest insignificance
before the putrefaction from which we come and will one day
return]{.underline}. **[Humans]{.underline}**, Bataille writes in his
masterwork the Accursed Share, **["\[appear\] to be the only animal to
be ashamed of that nature whence he comes, and from which he does not
cease to have departed]{.underline}**."24 [We feel primal
shame,]{.underline} according to Bataille, [because the decay we are
conscious of suggests servility and baseness]{.underline}.25 i[s primary
disdain for animal nature]{.underline}, and our dependence upon [it,
spurs fantastical **efforts to dominate our bodies**, each other, and
the more-than-human-world in attempts to o set felt servility with felt
dominance]{.underline}. For Bataille, much of **[human history can be
read as a permanent struggle against animality.]{.underline}**26 In e
Accursed Share he observes that humanity "resembles those parvenus who
are ashamed of their humble origin. Thy rid themselves of anything
suggesting it. What are the 'noble' and 'good' families," he writes of
upper class morality, "if not those in which their wealthy birth is the
most carefully concealed?"27 One of the crucial rationales for
accumulating wealth, according to Bataille, is that ma**[terial riches
help us distinguish ourselves not only from animality, but also from
those we take to be nature's proxies in our fantastical e orts to
dominate the nature we fear]{.underline}**. [Proxies]{.underline}, in
the Euro-American context, [have included Indigenous peoples, women,
people of color, and workers. ese proxies have been discursively linked
to animal nature and then materially controlled in efforts to provide
compensatory hits of dominion.]{.underline} For Bataille, "\[i\]t is not
so much wealth\... that distinguishes, that qualities socially, as it is
the greatest distance from animality."28 [We dominate our bodies and
each other in efforts to surpass and ultimately control our animality,
our impermanence. is desire to "destroy the animal nature within
us]{.underline}," he suggests, lurks behind many of our most vexing
political and ecological problems.29 In Bataille's view, the pull of
**[existential resentment is universal]{.underline}**; **[it is a human
struggle]{.underline}**.30 He is attuned, however, to the important
mediating role played by culture. Individuals and cultures relate to
existential realities like impermanence in multiple ways. Tibetan
Buddhism, for example, offers meditative practices for befriending the
reality of death. We are not destined to resentfully interpret death as
domineering, or to flee from felt servility with fantasies of mastery.

### Knowledge

#### The status quo educational apparatus functions according to the desire for utility and knowledge, or virtue economy. This process creates a complete universalization of all bodies according to a system of calculability. This process assumes that knowledge itself must exist within the realm of the encodable, the possible. Our argument is that this very desire for "utility" in education destroys the possibility for knowledge to exist beyond spatiality -- into the realm of the unknown. We say that this form of politics is cowardice in that it observes the shore of the ocean but doesn't dare to take the dive, thereby destroying the ability to achieve the "extreme limit" of life itself. The impact to this is the reduction of life to nothing but a cog in the western machine of values and productivity.

We will focus on a conversation in virtue epistemology because [virtue
epistemology is not only concerned with the norms that govern truth- and
knowledge-production; but]{.underline} it is also, and primarily,
[**concerned with the intellectual character of knowers**. Virtue
epistemology is]{.underline} thus uniquely [suited to highlight the
demands epistemology places on producers of truth]{.underline} [and
knowledge in]{.underline} two registers: [the quality of belief and
truth and the cognitive character of the believer or knower as
well]{.underline}. Virtue epistemology's [focus on intellectual
character is an amplification of philosophy and epistemology's
**emphasis on utility**.]{.underline} The fo[cus on intellectual virtue
is]{.underline} ultimately [a focus on utility, but in virtue
epistemology it is not enough that one's knowledge may be useful; the
way in which one's knowledge is sought]{.underline}, produced,
communicated, and acquired [must also serve utility,]{.underline} and it
must be done by making use of one's intellectual virtues. [Virtue
epistemology has thus strayed a bit from its Aristotelian
roots]{.underline}, where **[knowledge was conceived of as valuable for
its own sake,]{.underline}** and virtue(s) [associated with living a
life that allowed one to acquire knowledge were conceived of as ends in
themselves, insofar as they were constitutive of the good
life.]{.underline} In this sense, [this thesis offers a corrective. If
virtue epistemology]{.underline} (Greco and Sosa in particular) [employ
an Aristotelian notion of virtue, they ought to acknowledge that their
notions of intellectual virtue are in fact only partially Aristotelian,
as they argue for the necessity of knowledge that is not merely valuable
in and of itself. The acquisitive possibilities of knowledge have been
overstressed by the virtue epistemology conversation, and the
**non-acquisitive possibilities have been ignored.**]{.underline}

But [virtue epistemology is a sub-disciplinary expression of the
principles and presumptions of epistemology in general, and thus of
philosophy in general]{.underline}. In order to highlight this, we will
move back-and-forth between a wider focus on epistemology and philosophy
in general, and our particular conversation in virtue epistemology.

I will begin by offering a sketch of the argument to be made in the
document. The work of Linda Zagzebski, John Greco, and Ernest Sosa forms
a cluster of ideas in virtue epistemology---the cluster on which we will
focus3. I will claim that [the conversation we see them having---about
the value of knowledge]{.underline} (and consequently, the nature of
knowledge)---[exhibits]{.underline} and relies upon certain
[characteristic features of what I will call "**classical epistemology"
or "classical knowing."**]{.underline} It will come as no surprise that
a particular conversation in [mainstream virtue epistemology exhibits
and relies on features of classical epistemology.]{.underline} I draw
our attention to these features so that we remember them as we begin the
discussion of nonknowledge.

The concept of [nonknowledge contains elements and approaches to the
acts of thinking and communicating that I will call an "alternate
epistemology]{.underline}." These elements are neither a-philosophical
nor a- or anti-epistemological, but [**they do not fit easily into the
virtue epistemology**]{.underline} we will examine. And yet, [if we find
them philosophically compelling and sound, we are required to
re-evaluate the virtue epistemology explanations for the
value]{.underline}--- and nature---[of knowledge]{.underline}. Doing
[this re-evaluation will require]{.underline}, as I have suggested,
[looking at more than just the virtue epistemology
conversation]{.underline}. And it will require [looking at the virtue
epistemology conversation as a sub-disciplinary expression of
epistemology generally, and even more generally, of philosophy
itself.]{.underline}

The argument will have four parts. In the first part (this chapter) I
will introduce the virtue epistemology conversation and the features of
classical epistemology we see at work in it. In the second chapter I
will introduce and explain two important elements of nonknowledge,
returning to the virtue epistemology conversation from time to time. The
third chapter has two goals: (1) to introduce and explain the most
significant element of nonknowledge alongside (2) my claim that
nonknowledge is "epistemic expenditure." In the fourth chapter I will
return to our virtue epistemology cluster in order to claim that if we
think nonknowledge has got something right, we have committed ourselves
to a position that is at odds with what some in virtue
epistemology---under the umbrella of classical epistemology and
classical knowing---have said about the nature of knowledge and its
relationship to utility, acquisition, teleology, communicability, and
productivity. The fourth chapter is where I hone in on the central
positive argument that nonknowledge can in fact be a feature of
knowledge-creation. This is in line with a pre-existing claim (from
Bataille and Bataille scholars like Ladelle McWhorter4) that
nonknowledge is already occurring within knowledge.

Part 1: Virtue Epistemology, Subset of Epistemology

In this introductory chapter, I identify [eight presumptions in the
sampling of one particular conversation in virtue
epistemology]{.underline}. We will discuss these presumptions briefly
but in some detail (before returning to the cluster after the
explanation of nonknowledge), in order to do justice to the conversation
taking place in our cluster. Rather than artificially separate the
virtue epistemology conversation into eight sections that match the
following eight points, we will follow the conversation as it unfolds,
pausing at times to reflect on how we see the presumptions at work in
the conversation. Because [the presumptions are persistent qualities, we
cannot simply point to each moment they arise and leave it at that. We
have to follow the conversation to see their persistence.]{.underline}

Here are the presumptions of classical epistemology we can see at work
in the virtue epistemology cluster:

**[1. That knowledge is communicable, especially in the form of clear
propositions.]{.underline}**

**[2. That knowledge can be continuously acquired, as though it were a
good.]{.underline}**

**[3. That the acquisition of knowledge has an aim---that it is a
teleological pursuit.]{.underline}**

**[4. That knowledge is valuable.]{.underline}**

**[5. That knowledge is useful.]{.underline}**

**[6. That what counts as knowledge can be objectively determined (and
relatedly, that it is measurable as a system of debit and
credit.)]{.underline}**

**[7. That virtue epistemology is a distinct community which forms the
authority on matters of knowledge (why knowledge is valuable, who gets
to be a knower, etc.)]{.underline}**

**[8. That the intellectual character of the knower plays an important
role in how and why knowledge is acquired5.]{.underline}**

These [presumptions demonstrate what]{.underline} I will identify as the
"[**closed" or "restricted" nature of this particular economy** of
knowledge.]{.underline} What this means is that as an [expression of
philosophy]{.underline} (more generally), epistemology (more
specifically), [and the virtue epistemology conversation]{.underline}
(even more specifically), [that they are limiting]{.underline}. The
[presumptions patrol the borders of knowledge in a way that is
detrimental to the discovery of new knowledge;]{.underline} namely,
[they cannot see the "waste" that ought to play an integral part in the
creation of knowledge]{.underline}. In this particular virtue
epistemology conversation, [we see this limiting and patrolling happen
via a focus on teleology]{.underline}, acquisition, and
utility/production. In order to demonstrate that this focus on
utility/production, acquisition, and [teleology is not unique to our
virtue epistemology conversation, we have to move outward,]{.underline}
and backward. We can begin by looking to Aristotle, as Zagzebski, Greco,
and Sosa all happen to employ some version of an Aristotelian notion of
virtue in their respective versions of a proper virtue epistemology.

In Book VI of the Nicomachean Ethics, [Aristotle determines that
knowledge must be demonstrable]{.underline}, first and foremost:
"Knowledge, then, is the state of capacity to demonstrate \[\...\] for
it is when a man believes in a certain way and the principles are known
to him that he has knowledge, since if they are not better known to him
than the conclusion, he will have his knowledge only incidentally"
(1139b 31-5). [Aristotelian knowledge]{.underline} (not to be confused
with phronesis, or practical wisdom6) thus [requires accountability and
reliability of the knower, and communicability of the knowledge
itself.]{.underline} In the Aristotelian [tradition of
defining]{.underline}, separating, and categorizing, [we can see the
history of knowledge in philosophy as a kind of entomology of thought
and language]{.underline} (from the Greek entomos, "that which is cut in
pieces or segmented7"): [a dissecting, labeling, storing,
displaying]{.underline}, and careful [considering of both the workings
of the intellect and our ways of communicating the workings of the
intellect8]{.underline}. And as the descendant of Aristotle, philosophy
has [held tight to the Aristotelian notion that knowledge requires
demonstrability]{.underline}. [Demonstrability includes
communicability]{.underline}; we see this reflected, for example, in the
large body of epistemological literature devoted to testimony9.
[**Demonstrability includes utility**, as it is through demonstrability
that utility can be determined]{.underline}. We will [see this reflected
in the virtue epistemology]{.underline} conversation, but we see it
reflected more generally in the history of philosophy. Shannon [Winnubst
expresses concern that in epistemology and philosophy we see knowledge
being "ordered sequentially]{.underline} as the progressive development
of clearer and more useful endpoints," such that **[utility becomes the
primary interest]{.underline}**. Philosophy's [accounts of knowledge
have thus required an increased focus on utility, such that utility may
be "our highest value":]{.underline}

This [teleological order narrows in scope in later modern
thought,]{.underline} exemplified perhaps in the [texts of John Locke,
where utility **becomes the singular criterion** to determine the
satisfaction of desire's demands]{.underline}: we know who/what we are
through the usefulness that our lives/actions achieve. [Across both of
these schemas of broad teleology and more narrow utility, knowledge is
ordered sequentially as the progressive development of clearer and more
useful endpoints]{.underline}. The demarcation of each segment of
thinking---of each [concept---thereby becomes critical to the forward
march of knowledge's ordering of experience]{.underline} and the world.
\[\...\] [If this construction of meaning through the delimitation of
concepts is the necessary structure of knowledge, then we find
**ourselves embedded not only in a limited economy of the psychosocial
world**]{.underline} through desire-prohibition-identity, but [**also in
a limited economy of epistemology**: our very impulses to find
meaning]{.underline} (through teleology broadly, and utility
specifically) [and the way that we undertake this process]{.underline}
(through the delimitation of concepts) [may already enact a normative
order of knowledge]{.underline} that sufficiently conditions the
emergence of utility as our highest value ("Bataille's Queer Pleasures,"
RBN 85-6).

Winnubst's concern is pertinent. In the introduction to The Web of
Belief, for example, Quine and Ullian dismiss any line of thought that
does not clearly contribute to "acquiring and sustaining right beliefs,"
because acquiring right beliefs is useful:

A current Continuing Education catalogue offers a course description,
under the heading "Philosophy", that typifies the dark view at its
darkest: "[Children of science that we are, we have based our cultural
patterns on logic, **on the cognitive, on the verifiable**]{.underline}.
But more and more [there has crept into current research and study the
haunting suggestion that there are other kinds of knowledge unfathomable
by our cognition,]{.underline} [other ways of knowing]{.underline}
beyond the limits of our logic, [which are deserving of our serious
attention]{.underline}." Now "[knowledge unfathomable by our cognition"
is simply incoherent]{.underline}, as attention to the words makes
clear. Moreover, [all that creeps is not gold. One wonders how many
students enrolled. Not that soberly seeking to learn is all there should
be; let there be fun and games as well]{.underline}. But let it also be
clear where the boundaries are. [A person might have a moderately
amusing time playing with a Ouija board, but if he drifts into the
belief that it is a bona fide avenue to discovery then something has
gone amiss.]{.underline} We will not pursue the possible socio-benefits
of anti-rational doctrines; i[n our eyes, much better escapes from
reality are available, if that's what's wanted]{.underline}. In the
chapters ahead we will be interested in the ways of acquiring and
sustaining right beliefs, be they pleasant or painful (The Web of Belief
5).

This example is a bit comical, but [notice the **dismissal of anything
that might be conceived of as "anti-rational**"---a dismissal so
complete it reduces any "anti-rational" thought to playing with a Ouija
board.]{.underline} Quine and Ullian imply that "[anti-rationality"
ought to be dismissed precisely because it cannot assist with
acquisition]{.underline}---"acquiring and sustaining right beliefs"
(ibid). [In more contemporary mainstream epistemology, Timothy
Williamson expresses the same necessity for utility and teleology:
"Desire aspires to action; belief aspires to knowledge. The point of
desire is action; the point of belief is knowledge]{.underline}"
(Knowledge and its Limits 1). Or within mainstream feminist
epistemology, Linda Alcoff and Elizabeth Potter stress the **[importance
of granting epistemic authority to women and other historically excluded
groups in order to expand and increase the production of knowledge. This
is ultimately a concern with utility]{.underline}**: "For feminists, the
[purpose of epistemology is not only to satisfy intellectual curiosity,
but also to contribute to an emancipatory goal: the expansion of
democracy in the production of knowledge]{.underline}" (Feminist
Epistemologies 13).

More generally, Michel [Foucault identifies this **utility-orienting
movement as an "epistemologization**" of all branches of
thought]{.underline} and knowledge, beginning with John Locke10 and (the
economist) Richard Cantillon11, and eventually becoming "the analysis of
the episteme" (The Archaeology of Knowledge 187-191). [Foucault's
immediate concern is not the ways in which episteme requires utility,
but the ways in which it requires formalization and
legislation]{.underline} (and then, secondarily or tertiarily, utility):

[This episteme may be suspected of being something like a world-view, a
slice of history common to all branches of knowledge, which imposes on
each one the same norms and postulates, a general stage of reason, a
certain structure of thought]{.underline} that the men of a particular
period cannot escape---a great body of legislation written once and for
all by some anonymous hand. By episteme, we mean, in fact, the total set
of relations that unite, at a given period, [the **discursive practices
that give rise to epistemological figures, sciences, and possibly
formalized systems**]{.underline}; \[\...\] The episteme is not a form
of knowledge (connaissance) or type of rationality which, crossing the
boundaries of the most varied sciences, manifests the sovereign unity of
a subject, a spirit, or a period; [it is the totality of relations that
can be discovered, for a given period, between the sciences when one
analyses them at the level of discursive regularities]{.underline} (ibid
191).

Thus the [examples of philosophy's utility-focus in this document cannot
possibly be a comprehensive list of all the utility-focused moments in
philosophy]{.underline}. But they can [illustrate the discursive
regularities of justifying the pursuit of knowledge via
utility]{.underline}, and they can illustrate that this
utility-orientation is not limited to the virtue epistemology
conversation. We cannot present here "the total set of relations" that
unite the discursive practice of epistemology, or virtue epistemology,
but we can examine the [discursive practices in one particular
conversation, understanding that the smaller conversation is a
representative of the dominant, formalized discourse.]{.underline} What
we find is a distinct emphasis on utility and teleology. I will claim
that this [focus on utility and teleology is part of what **makes for a
"closed" economy of knowledge**]{.underline}. And we will see,
especially, that [virtue epistemology's focus on intellectual character
is a doubling-down on the importance of utility]{.underline}: the
[concern with intellectual virtue is ultimately a concern with
utility]{.underline}, but it [is not enough that one's knowledge may be
useful; the way in which one's knowledge is sought, produced,
communicated, and acquired must also serve utility,]{.underline} and it
must be done by making use of one's suite of intellectual virtues.

We can move further outward in scope to see [Bataille's ultimate example
of the closed system of knowledge: the Hegelian dialectic]{.underline}.
The Hegelian dialectic is "[closed" because it offers the promise of
completion, finality, "salvation"---that is, the objectivity of absolute
knowledge:]{.underline}

A comic little summary. Hegel, I imagine, touched upon the extreme
limit. He was still young and believed himself to be going mad. I even
imagine that [he worked out the system in order to escape]{.underline}
(each type of conquest is, no doubt, the deed of a man fleeing a
threat). To conclude, [**Hegel attains satisfaction, turns his back on
the extreme limit.** Supplication is dead within him]{.underline}.
Whether or not one seeks salvation, in any case, one continues to live,
one can't be sure, one must continue to supplicate. While yet alive,
[Hegel won salvation, killed supplication, mutilated himself. Of him,
only the handle of a shovel remained, a modern man. But before
mutilating himself, no doubt he touched upon the extreme limit, knew
supplication: his memory brought him back to the perceived abyss, in
order to annul it! The system is the annulment]{.underline} (IE 43;
emphases Bataille's).

For Bataille, [the problem with Hegel's system is that it is "unable to
sustain the unknowability of the unknown and the
unknowable]{.underline}" (Boldt-Irons, On Bataille 5). **[When Hegel
encountered the unknowable---the "extreme limit"---he receded and found
the solid ground of a system]{.underline}**, of **[the known and the
knowable]{.underline}**. [Bataille accuses Hegel of using "system" to
annul the "extreme limit" of unknowability]{.underline}. Hegel's system
is [thus "closed"; there is no opening into the unknowable. But Bataille
believed and found multiple ways to claim that a "closed" system need
not be closed]{.underline}: "I think of my life---or better yet, its
abortive condition, the open wound that my life is---as itself
constituting a refutation of Hegel's closed system" (Guilty 12412). In
relation to knowledge and nonknowledge specifically, **[Bataille claims
that outside the closed system of Hegelian knowledge is
nonknowledge]{.underline}**: "Beyond all knowledge there is
non-knowledge and he who would become absorbed in the thought that
beyond his knowledge he knows nothing---even were he to have within him
Hegel's inexorable lucidity---would no longer be Hegel, but a painful
tooth in Hegel's mouth" (IE 169).

[Bataille seeks to find a way of knowing and a way of expressing such
knowing that is free from "method,"]{.underline} "discourse," "project,"
"system," [or any other stricture philosophy has placed on thinking,
reasoning]{.underline}, wondering, and all other mental activity, [and
the ways we report on such mental activity. For Bataille the problem
with "method" or "project" or whatever else we might call it, as we will
see, is that it is **yoked to utility,**]{.underline} teleology,
production, acquisition, and thus [to **a system of limiting** what we
think and what we imagine it is possible to think]{.underline}. Jacques
Derrida writes, "philosophy is work itself according to Bataille"
(Writing and Difference 252; emphasis Derrida's). Jeffrey Kosky echoes
this:

[Project makes every moment of life servile by valuing it solely in
relation to its usefulness in producing a desired end]{.underline}. It
finds an ally or mirror, according to Bataille, in the forms of
knowledge and rationality promoted by Hegelian systematic philosophy.
[For]{.underline} Georg Wilhelm Friedrich [Hegel, according to Bataille,
reasonable thought is systematic thought that sees each individual and
each moment in relation to the whole that transcends it]{.underline}.
[Bataille was sensitive to the fact that the Hegelian dialectic of
consciousness is driven by unhappy consciousness and that it represents
the historical progress of the slave who survives the struggle with the
master.]{.underline} The Hegelian spirit, which for [Bataille expressed
the spirit of modernity, belongs therefore to a **sad, servile, and
serious culture**,]{.underline} a culture that is always on the job, one
that has no time for errant moments of laughter, tears, drunkenness, or
ecstasy ("Georges Bataille's Religion without Religion" 80).

[According to Bataille, utility is the "spirit of
modernity."]{.underline} That is, the [**obsession with demonstrating
one's value** in reference to one's work]{.underline} ("always on the
job"), [in reference to one's seriousness and work ethic]{.underline}
("no time for errant moments"), and [in reference to **one's
productivity**]{.underline} (a representation of the "historical
progress of the slave who survives the struggle with the master"---what
we might call "upward mobility"). [The question for this project---this
document---then, is how to explain somewhat systematically a way of
knowing that is free from "system" and the other requirements of
philosophy-as-work.]{.underline}

### Literacy

#### We the students are seen as pieces to be moved around the chess board, the player the academy, our bodies pieces sacrificed endless times for the sadistic joy of the system, locked into the idea of a perfect game, we become reduced to a number to fill an empty chair.

11-13

[While functional literacy stresses the importance of literacy to the
adaptation of the individual]{.underline}, **[the literacy-as-power
metaphor emphasizes a relationship between literacy and group or
community advancement.]{.underline}** Historically, **[literacy has been
a potent tool in maintaining the hegemony of elites and dominant
classes]{.underline}** in certain societies, while laying the basis for
increased social and political participation in others (Resnick 1983;
Goody 1968). **[In a contemporary framework, expansion of literary
skills is often viewed as a means for poor and politically powerless
groups to claim their place in the world]{.underline}**. The
International Symposium for Literacy, meeting in Persepolis, Iran
(Bataille 1976), appealed to national governments to consider literacy
as an instrument for human liberation and social change. **[Paulo Freire
(1970) bases his influential theory of literacy education on the need to
make literacy a resource for fundamental social
transformation.]{.underline}** **[Effective literacy
education]{.underline}**, in his view, crates a critical consciousness
through which a community can analyze its conditions of social existence
and engage in effective action for a just society. **[Not to be literate
is a state of victimization. Yet the capacity of literacy to confer
power or to be the primary impetus for significant and lasting economic
or social change has proved problematic in developing
countries.]{.underline}** Studies (Gayter, Hall, Kidd, and Shivasrava
1979; United Nations Development Program 1976) of UNESCOe\'s
experimental world literacy program have raised doubts about earlier
notions that higher literacy rates automatically promote national
development and improve the social and material conditions of the very
poor. The relationship between social change and literacy education, it
is now suggested (Harman 1977), may be stronger in the other direction.
When masses of people have been mobilized for fundamental changes in
social conditions-as in the USSR, China, Cuba, and Tanzania-rapid
extensions of literacy have been accomplished (Gayter et al. 1979;
Hammiche 1976; Scribner 1982b). Movements to transform social reality
appear to have been effective in some parts of the world in bringing
whole populations into participation in modern literacy activities. The
validity of the converse proposition-that literacy per se mobilizes
people for action to change their social reality- remains to be
established. What does this mean for us**[? The one undisputed fact
about illiteracy in America is its concentration among poor, black,
elderly, and minority- language groups -groups without effective
participation in our coun- try\'seconomic and educational
institutions]{.underline}** (Hunter and Harman 19.79). Problems of
poverty and political powerlessness are, as among some populations in
developing nations, inseparably intertwined with prob- lems of access to
knowledge and levels of literacy skills. Some (e.g., Kozol 1980) suggest
that a mass and politicized approach to literacy education such as that
adopted by Cuba is demanded in these conditions. Others (e.g., Hunter
and Harman 1979) advocate a more action-oriented approach that views
community mobilization around practical, social, and political goals as
a first step in creating the conditions for effective literacy
instruction and for educational equity. The possibilities and limits of
the literacy-as-power metaphor within our present-day social and
political structure are not at all clear. To what extent can
instructional experiences and programs be lifted out f their social
contexts in other countries and applied here? Do assumptions about the
functionality and significance of literacy in poor communities in the
United States warrant further consideration? Reder and Green\'s (1984)
research and educational work among West Coast immigrant communities
reveals that literacy has different meanings for members of different
groups. How can these cultural variations be taken into account? How are
communities best mobilized for literacy- around local needs and
small-scale activism? or as part of broader political and social
movements? If literacy has not emerged as a priority demand, should
government and private agencies undertake to mobilize communities around
this goal? And can such efforts be productive without the deep
involvement of community leaders?

### Politics

#### Their conception of politics is life denying and restrictive. The politics they champion make community, meaning, and value impossible. Against such a domesticated and meager understanding of the political, we call for impossible communities, for a celebration of death in life! 

**Pawlett 15** (William Pawlett is a senior lecturer in Media and
Cultural Studies at the University of Wolverhampton. *Georges Bataille:
the Sacred and Society*. Routledge. 56-62)

In this new engagement with Nietzsche, Bataille seems to equate all
political positions with servility and domesticity. **[Politics itself
is restrictive: 'Life's movement]{.underline}** can only be merged with
the limited movements of political formations in clearly defined
conditions; in other conditions, it **[goes far beyond
them]{.underline}**, precisely into the region to which Nietzsche's
attention was drawn' ('Nietzsche and the Fascists', in Bataille, 1985,
p. 193). **[To a world understood in narrowly political terms, Bataille
opposes the figure of the labyrinth -- a place of many possibilities, of
destiny and tragedy, a horizontal and immanent space drawn on the
surface of the globe]{.underline}**. Bataille makes clear his hostility
to [all vertical erections]{.underline}, monuments and 'great unitary
constructions' [such as the nation, the state and the
church]{.underline}. These institutions [enforce]{.underline}
[servility. It is no longer 'political' revolution but 'religious
upheaval that will push life's movement beyond servility']{.underline}
(p. 198). A position on the nature of society and civilisation becomes
apparent: '**[The only society full of life and force, the only free
society,]{.underline}** is the bi or polycephalic society that **[gives
the fundamental antagonisms of life a constant explosive outlet, but one
limited to the richest forms]{.underline}**' (p. 199**[). Such a society
would allow humans to be acephalic, to exist beyond reason, knowledge
and duration -- at least on specified ritual occasions where taboos
would be violated]{.underline}**, hence such a society would enforce
limits. Bataille also develops a new, more nuanced, position on war in
these writings. After declaring: 'What we are starting is a War' and 'I
myself am War' -- highly ambiguous statements -- [Bataille moved to a
position that clearly condemned war**. In its modern form, war is a
strategy for maintaining the illusory permanence of nation states, a
method of violently resisting time in which states 'try to deny death by
reducing it to a component of a glory without dread'**]{.underline} (p.
200). **[War attempts to conquer the dread of death and the
inevitability of loss by claiming a greater purpose for the violence
inherent in life.]{.underline}** Yet, **[for Bataille,
death]{.underline}** (personal mortality) **[should be confronted,
embraced, meditated upon in what he called the practice of joy before
death -- not directed against external enemies]{.underline}**. Maurice
Blanchot, writing on Bataille's notion of community, quotes Bataille:
'[It is necessary for communal life to maintain itself at the height of
death']{.underline} (Bataille, cited in Blanchot, 1988, p. 11). The
influence of Hegel on Bataille is unmistakable in this statement, **[a
community must embrace the negative, its own suffering, its death and
its rebirth.]{.underline}** Another major theme of Acéphale is
Bataille's rethinking of Nietzsche's notion of the death of God: '[The
acephalic man mythologically expresses sovereignty committed to
destruction and the death of God']{.underline}. What pre- cisely does
Bataille mean by the death of God? He elaborates as follows: **[The
search for god, for the absence of movement, for tranquillity, is the
fear that has scuttled all attempts at]{.underline}** a universal
**[community]{.underline}** . . . **[peace is produced only if God
allows himself to be locked up in the isolation and profoundly immobile
permanence of a group's military existence]{.underline}** . . .
**[Universal existence, eternally unfinished and acephalic, a world like
a bleeding wound, endlessly creating and destroying particular finite
beings:]{.underline}** it is in this sense that true uni- versality is
the death of God. (Bataille, 1985, p. 201) So it is not simply that
notions of God or the divine get in the way of or prevent a universal
community (John Lennon's position in 'Imag- ine'), but that the divine
or '[God' has become servile and enchained by reason]{.underline} or
homogeneity. [Gods should expend; they should bleed; they should give of
themselves and, in return, receive sacrifices.]{.underline} Monumental-
ised forms of 'God' should be toppled; they should be killed or,
perhaps, joined with death in sacrifice and in sacrifice the sacred
comes to life. This is 'the sacrifice that founds the community by
undoing it' (Blan- chot, 1988, p. 15). Here myth, [the sacred and
sacrifice are not forms of violence directed against the 'other'; they
are forms of violence which the community directs at itself, not
bolstering itself against others but acknowledging its own
nothingness.]{.underline} This is a quite specific sense of the death of
God, then, not one which replicates Nietzsche but which shifts the
ground. In a sense Bataille offers a far more 'social' and collective
sense to this notion. [God become monument, become authority, become
barrier, become 'head' must be killed -- God that has been confined,
rationalised and made to serve the state]{.underline}. Indeed, for
Bataille, **[civilisation itself -- stabilised society -- is life in
stagnation, decomposition and crisis.]{.underline}** The 'living
community little by lit- tle loses its tragic appearance -- both puerile
and terrible -- which reached each being in his most secretly lacerated
wound; it loses the power of provoking the total religious emotion that
grows to the point of ecstatic drunkenness, when existence is avidly
opened before it' (Bataille, 1985, pp. 202--203). There is, for
Bataille, another sense of the divine: not the God of the Greek
philosophers but the 'christ of the erotic saints', not the God of a
state or territory but a divine that emerges in the shared loss of both
the human and of God. In mutual loss or sacrificial expenditure is the
deepest or most intimate communication and the possibility for an
'impossible' community; this theme is explored further in Chapter 6.
**[Civilisation is a weakening of communal passions -- passionate bonds
as well as passionate antagonisms -- and as these passions weaken 'it
becomes necessary to use constraint and to develop the alliances,
contracts, and falsifications that are called politics']{.underline}**
(Bataille, 1985, p. 203). Bataille's concern is what might be called the
pre-political, pre-foundational con- ditions of human life, which can
also become a new post-historical community. We have seen already that
this pre-foundational condition is, for Bataille, quite real, or rather
material -- it is not imaginary, not a structure of the unconscious.
Indeed, Bataille devotes several works to trying to understanding the
pre-foundational, prehistoric life of humans, as Chapter 1 on animality
indicated. COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL POWER [Bataille contrasts community as a
structure which aims at securing its permanence, denying or disavowing
death, with community in a more vital sense meaning a coming together of
human beings in an immediate awareness of mortality and of their radical
'insufficiency'.]{.underline} It seems that **[any established community
-- before it grows into an entity that could be called a culture,
society or nation -- is founded in death, in a painful awareness of
mortality.]{.underline}** **[Yet, gradually, through the erection of
monuments and other barricades against time, as well as against the
surrounding spaces, a 'community' comes to imagine itself as necessary
and permanent. Such a community becomes hierarchical; it is ruled by a
head]{.underline}**. [Just as all of its members are ruled, they must
also rule themselves, must learn to negate their passions and use their
head. **All community is rooted in death -- always touches death -- but
as communities become monocephalic, their relationship to death becomes
one of negation rather than affirmation.**]{.underline} Egyptian society
under the pharaohs or god-kings is the archetype of this process. Of the
great pyra- mids dotted along the Nile, Bataille writes, 'no enterprise
cost a greater amount of labour than this one, which wanted to halt the
flow of time . . . they transcend the intolerable void that time opens
under men's feet, for all possible movement is halted in their geometric
surfaces. IT SEEMS THAT THEY MAINTAIN WHAT ESCAPES FROM THE DYING MAN'
(Bataille, 1985, p. 216, emphasis in original). **[Only as community
organises itself through a head, through authority and through military
sovereignty and repression, does it become de-vitalised and stagnant:
its repressive measures extend, becoming increasingly
insidious]{.underline}** and sophisticated as it can no longer immedi-
ately inspire, impassion or enchant its members. We might accept that
this is loosely the case, or is at least a plausible general narrative,
but it raises important questions. First, was there ever a community
that did not depend upon a repressive authority structure? Relatedly,
was there ever, and [could there ever be, a community that genuinely
impassions its members? Bataille's answer]{.underline} -- at least at
[the]{.underline} time of **[Acéphale]{.underline}** -- [is an
unequivocal yes]{.underline} to both of these questions. [The
'pre-foundations' of Christianity]{.underline}, powerfully visualised in
Van der Weyden's Deposition of Christ (1435) as consisting of a
distraught Mary Magdalene, with Peter, Joseph of Arimathea and a few
others removing a corpse from a cross; [the 'pre-foundations' of
Buddhism (Siddhartha's abandonment of a life of comfort and pleasure to
confront suffering); the springing of Dionysus]{.underline} from the
dying womb of Semele, murdered by Zeus: **[all of these seem to fulfill
Bataille's notion of the vital community of death, a sense of community
so forceful that it provokes the ecstatic frenzy of its followers yet
still cannot endure, lapsing into memorialised 'culture' with the
passage of time]{.underline}** (Bataille, 1985, pp. 205--206). In making
**[the distinction between a vital, 'impossible' community and the
devitalised vestiges of such a community securing itself through
ideological and military structures, Bataille develops important sets of
relations: between the fullness or totality of being, and the fragmented
or mutilated state of individual existence; between the active
accumulation of knowledge and its suspension in ecstatic
'non-knowledge'; between an 'external' perspective examining life in
terms of substance and objects, and an internal or 'inner experience' in
which substances and objects are felt to 'dissolve', where the energies,
forces and flows that are obscured by objects are felt with irresistible
intensity.]{.underline}** These sets of relations are vital for an
understanding of Bataille's notion of community, and also for his
writings on mysticism and inner experience; they also form the basis
from which Bataille develops his more systematic notions of general and
restricted economy in The Accursed Share. Bataille's position on the
possibility of community springs from his passionate anti-individualism,
clearly marked in his earliest writings and developed throughout his
career. [**Modern life, with its specialised functions and
instrumentalism, robs humans of much of their fullness of being; the
modern notion of the individual is a 'degraded particle lacking
reality'. Life is reduced to a function:** the doctor, priest, teacher,
cleaner, or most mutilated of all, the business leader]{.underline}.
**[The incumbent of each of these roles must absorb the specialised
knowledge of their function. Knowledge itself is mutilated in this
process, the general or overarching perspective is lost and our
relations to other people shrink to the functional level]{.underline}**.
**[We become increasingly contemptuous of those who occupy roles other
than our own,]{.underline}** in fact, Bataille suggests, [it seems as if
others, especially those 'lower' on the scale of functions, lack being
and seem to be mere phantoms.]{.underline} Yet, it is not simply that
modernity values instrumental or restricted knowledge over some sense of
'true' or authentic knowledge. [**Knowledge itself is a restriction of
experience:** it alienates the subject from action and experience,
whether this experience is political, erotic, religious or creative, or
all of these simultaneously]{.underline}. **[The modern restriction of
being to sets of functions and uses is]{.underline}** not at all
accidental, nor is it only a by-product of capitalist accumulation: it
is **[part of a fundamental 'flight' from being, from the terror of
finitude and insufficiency]{.underline}**. Indeed, for Bataille, '[At
the basis of human life there exists a principle of insufficiency . . .
a limitless insufficiency']{.underline} (Bataille, 1985, p. 172).
[Everything human reveals this insufficiency: the genitals declare
mortality and the need to reproduce; the mouth and the anus are evidence
of the circulation of energy and the inevitability of waste and
discharge; the skin craves the touch of other bodies. Language too
testifies that **being can never be autonomous,** that there is only
'being-in-relation']{.underline} (p. 174). **[Being is not merely
complex, it is labyrinthine -- it must wander, and it will lose its
way.]{.underline}** Bataille's passionate anti-individualism has led a
number of commentators to term Bataille an anti-humanist (Land, 1992;
Noys, 2000). This is the case if we take a restricted view of the human,
or if we consider the 'human' to be a product of restriction and
degradation. However, Bataille -- particularly in later works, but also
in the 1930s -- seems to regard the human, at its limits, to be a
magnificent, beautiful, even 'divine' creature. This was Bataille's
attitude to the Chinese torture vic- tim, to Christ on the cross
abandoned both by his followers and by God, and to the emergence of Homo
sapiens from animality. **[Human beings are capable of moving through or
beyond the limits imposed by civili-sation. This happens through the
sacred, through art and literature, and through crime and
transgression.]{.underline}** Human communities and relations can
transcend the level of 'degraded particles', and this transcendence can
endure, at least for a short time: 'The exchange between two human
par-ticles in fact possesses the faculty of surviving momentary
separation' (Bataille, 1985, p. 174). This assertion prefigures
Bataille's development of a general economic thinking on eroticism in
the 1940s and 1950s: 'Men committed to political struggles will never be
able to yield to the truth of eroticism' (1991, p. 191). CONCLUSION
[**What looks like politics**, and imagines itself to be political,
**will one day unmask itself as a religious movemen**t]{.underline}.
(Kierkegaard, quoted by Bataille, 1985, p. 178) Bataille gave no
allegiance to any political party or ideology. Instead he formed many
short-lived groups for the discussion of ideas; none of these hardened
into an organisation. Bataille's commitment to the revolutionary idea of
the sacred as revolt and overthrowing of both existing society and
existing religion made it impossible for him to be integrated within any
Marxist or communist organisation, yet he remained close, indeed
'intimate' with one of the fundamental aspi- rations of communism: the
breaking down of individualism and the acknowledgement of the deep and
'universal' commonality of all humanity. Bataille's publications on
politics ridicule ethical and moral thinking as the props and alibis of
liberal capitalist exploitation, stating that all thought that does not
immediately challenge capitalism has a 'demeanour of senile trickery and
comical smugness' (Bataille, 1985, p. 32). **[Mainstream political
debate]{.underline}** and ethical discussion **[is ruled
by]{.underline}** such **[trickery and smugness to this day. There has
been absolutely no rejuvenation of political thought since Bataille's
day, indeed if the dominant liberal traditions were senile in Bataille's
age, they are zombiefied today, preserved in a media void, neither dead
nor alive and leaving the majority utterly indifferent]{.underline}**.
Yet, Bataille's position was an optimistic one: the 'uprising of the
lower classes' promised a new society beyond bourgeois liberal
capitalism. The agitation of the lower classes is analogous to the left
pole of the sacred: they must bring down the elevated and powerful in
order to rejuvenate the whole. Bataille finds in Nietzsche powerful
support for his growing dis- trust of political organisation and action.
For Bataille, **[politics]{.underline}** (in the accepted or restricted
sense) **[is always tied to temporality, to objects and goals: it
reflects on the past, finds it deficient and seeks improvements for the
future. This is what enslaves politics to time or duration, just as it
enslaves human beings to a condition of working for and anticipating
ends and goals, and the elusive search for happiness]{.underline}**.
**[The present moment is denied or suppressed]{.underline}**. **[Being
is thus fragmented by role, career, position, place,
time]{.underline}**. For Bataille, **[the present -- an eternal moment
of infinite freedom, must not be denied.]{.underline}** **[Given this
constitu- tive fragmentation, politics, in the conventional sense, can
only fail. It must fail because, in a sense, it is designed to
fail,]{.underline}** just as ethics always fails -- neither really help
the lowly or excluded. **[They fail because their purpose is to defuse
the incendiary nature of being, to deny the scream of life, to prescribe
a slow, torturous neutralisation of life mortgaged against the future.
The future always belongs to those with power; it is the now which must
be seized. Bataille's 'politics' is a politics of community, of an
'impossible' community]{.underline}**. Though **[Bataille]{.underline}**
**[rejects parliamentary democracy and its political systems, parties
and organisations as barriers to freedom, along with all utopian
attempts to reform or ameliorate the existing system, it does not follow
that his thought is apolitical as some have charged. Bataille's
revolutionary thinking on the political envisages a different world, a
fundamentally altered society,]{.underline}** and an altered or 'other'
commu- nism (Bataille, in Mitchell & Winfree, 2009, p. 205). Far from
giving up on these hopes, Bataille turned to mysticism and to eroticism
**[to deepen this search for revolutionary
transformation]{.underline}**. [Mysticism and eroticism do indeed open
new worlds, worlds radically other than that of productive, servile
labour and the demands of capitalist accumulation.]{.underline}

### Policy simulation

#### The affirmatives act of reading a plan is one that attempts to define and develop an identity centered around the law through an act of civic engagement defined by liberalism. This engagement is one that furthers necro politics and exonerates it by making the law "better" while masking violence

#### The aff's investment in legal reform is an venture into the economy of the post colony in this economy lawfare is responsible for reducing people to nothing but bare life and has mutated into a vacuum of life establishing a large body count in the postcolonial society

**Comaroff and Comaroff, 07**, (John Comaroff, Professor of African and
African American Studies and of Anthropology; Jean Comaroff, Professor
of African and African American Studies and of Anthropology, "Law and
disorder in the postcolony," pg. 31, 2007)/

[Lawfare can be limited or it can reduce people to "bare life"; in some
postcolonies]{.underline}, [it has mutated into a deadly necropolitics
with a rising body count]{.underline} ([see chapter 9). But it always
seeks to launder brute power in a wash of legitimacy]{.underline},
ethics, propriety. [Sometimes it is put to work]{.underline}, [as it was
in many colonial contexts]{.underline}, [to make new sorts of human
subjects]{.underline}; [sometimes it is the vehicle by which oligarchs
seize the sinews of state to further their economic ends]{.underline};
[sometimes it is a weapon of the weak]{.underline}, [turning authority
back on itself by commissioning the sanction of the court to make claims
for resources]{.underline}, recognition, voice, integrity,
sovereignty.[89 But ultimately]{.underline}, [it is neither the weak nor
the meek nor the marginal who predominate in such things]{.underline}.
[It is those equipped to play most potently inside the dialectic of law
and disorder]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, [to close a circle opened
in the preface]{.underline}, [returns us to Derrida]{.underline},
Agamben, [and Benjamin]{.underline}: [to the notion that the law
originates in violence and lives by violent means]{.underline}, [the
notion]{.underline}, [in other words]{.underline}, [that the legal and
the lethal animate and inhabit one another]{.underline}. [Whatever the
truth of the matter]{.underline}, [politics at large]{.underline}, [and
the politics of coercion in particular]{.underline}, [appear ever more
to be turning into lawfare]{.underline}. [But this still does not lay to
rest the questions that lurk beneath our narrative]{.underline},
although it does gesture toward some answers: Again, [why the fetishism
of legalities? What are its implications for the play of law and
dis/order in the postcolony? And what]{.underline}, if anything, makes
postcolonies different in this respect from other nation-states?

#### Politics is inherently restrictive. Their desire to form a political community is one that denies the inherent flux of life and remains indebted to a regime of violence that is the root cause of all forms of violence in the world. 

**Pawlett 16 (**William, senior lecturer in Media and Cultural Studies
at the University of Wolverhampton. "Georges Bataille: The Sacred and
Society.")

In this new engagement with Nietzsche, Bataille seems to equate all
political positions with servility and domesticity. **[Politics itself
is restrictive: 'Life's movement]{.underline}** can only be merged with
the limited movements of political formations in clearly defined
conditions; in other conditions, it **[goes far beyond
them]{.underline}**, precisely into the region to which Nietzsche's
attention was drawn' ('Nietzsche and the Fascists', in Bataille, 1985,
p. 193). **[To a world understood in narrowly political terms, Bataille
opposes the figure of the labyrinth -- a place of many possibilities, of
destiny and tragedy, a horizontal and immanent space drawn on the
surface of the globe]{.underline}**. Bataille makes clear his hostility
to [all vertical erections]{.underline}, monuments and 'great unitary
constructions' [such as the nation, the state and the
church]{.underline}. These institutions [enforce]{.underline}
[servility. It is no longer 'political' revolution but 'religious
upheaval that will push life's movement beyond servility']{.underline}
(p. 198). A position on the nature of society and civilisation becomes
apparent: '**[The only society full of life and force, the only free
society,]{.underline}** is the bi or polycephalic society that **[gives
the fundamental antagonisms of life a constant explosive outlet, but one
limited to the richest forms]{.underline}**' (p. 199**[). Such a society
would allow humans to be acephalic, to exist beyond reason, knowledge
and duration -- at least on specified ritual occasions where taboos
would be violated]{.underline}**, hence such a society would enforce
limits. Bataille also develops a new, more nuanced, position on war in
these writings. After declaring: 'What we are starting is a War' and 'I
myself am War' -- highly ambiguous statements -- [Bataille moved to a
position that clearly condemned war**. In its modern form, war is a
strategy for maintaining the illusory permanence of nation states, a
method of violently resisting time in which states 'try to deny death by
reducing it to a component of a glory without dread'**]{.underline} (p.
200). **[War attempts to conquer the dread of death and the
inevitability of loss by claiming a greater purpose for the violence
inherent in life.]{.underline}** Yet, **[for Bataille,
death]{.underline}** (personal mortality) **[should be confronted,
embraced, meditated upon in what he called the practice of joy before
death -- not directed against external enemies]{.underline}**. Maurice
Blanchot, writing on Bataille's notion of community, quotes Bataille:
'[It is necessary for communal life to maintain itself at the height of
death']{.underline} (Bataille, cited in Blanchot, 1988, p. 11). The
influence of Hegel on Bataille is unmistakable in this statement, **[a
community must embrace the negative, its own suffering, its death and
its rebirth.]{.underline}** Another major theme of Acéphale is
Bataille's rethinking of Nietzsche's notion of the death of God: '[The
acephalic man mythologically expresses sovereignty committed to
destruction and the death of God']{.underline}. What pre- cisely does
Bataille mean by the death of God? He elaborates as follows: **[The
search for god, for the absence of movement, for tranquillity, is the
fear that has scuttled all attempts at]{.underline}** a universal
**[community]{.underline}** . . . **[peace is produced only if God
allows himself to be locked up in the isolation and profoundly immobile
permanence of a group's military existence]{.underline}** . . .
**[Universal existence, eternally unfinished and acephalic, a world like
a bleeding wound, endlessly creating and destroying particular finite
beings:]{.underline}** it is in this sense that true uni- versality is
the death of God. (Bataille, 1985, p. 201) So it is not simply that
notions of God or the divine get in the way of or prevent a universal
community (John Lennon's position in 'Imag- ine'), but that the divine
or '[God' has become servile and enchained by reason]{.underline} or
homogeneity. [Gods should expend; they should bleed; they should give of
themselves and, in return, receive sacrifices.]{.underline} Monumental-
ised forms of 'God' should be toppled; they should be killed or,
perhaps, joined with death in sacrifice and in sacrifice the sacred
comes to life. This is 'the sacrifice that founds the community by
undoing it' (Blan- chot, 1988, p. 15). Here myth, [the sacred and
sacrifice are not forms of violence directed against the 'other'; they
are forms of violence which the community directs at itself, not
bolstering itself against others but acknowledging its own
nothingness.]{.underline} This is a quite specific sense of the death of
God, then, not one which replicates Nietzsche but which shifts the
ground. In a sense Bataille offers a far more 'social' and collective
sense to this notion. [God become monument, become authority, become
barrier, become 'head' must be killed -- God that has been confined,
rationalised and made to serve the state]{.underline}. Indeed, for

allegiance to any political party or ideology. Instead he formed many
short-lived groups for the discussion of ideas; none of these hardened
into an organisation. Bataille's commitment to the revolutionary idea of
the sacred as revolt and overthrowing of both existing society and
existing religion made it impossible for him to be integrated within any
Marxist or communist organisation, yet he remained close, indeed
'intimate' with one of the fundamental aspi- rations of communism: the
breaking down of individualism and the acknowledgement of the deep and
'universal' commonality of all humanity. Bataille's publications on
politics ridicule ethical and moral thinking as the props and alibis of
liberal capitalist exploitation, stating that all thought that does not
immediately challenge capitalism has a 'demeanour of senile trickery and
comical smugness' (Bataille, 1985, p. 32). **[Mainstream political
debate]{.underline}** and ethical discussion **[is ruled
by]{.underline}** such **[trickery and smugness to this day. There has
been absolutely no rejuvenation of political thought since Bataille's
day, indeed if the dominant liberal traditions were senile in Bataille's
age, they are zombiefied today, preserved in a media void, neither dead
nor alive and leaving the majority utterly indifferent]{.underline}**.
Yet, Bataille's position was an optimistic one: the 'uprising of the
lower classes' promised a new society beyond bourgeois liberal
capitalism. The agitation of the lower classes is analogous to the left
pole of the sacred: they must bring down the elevated and powerful in
order to rejuvenate the whole. Bataille finds in Nietzsche powerful
support for his growing dis- trust of political organisation and action.
For Bataille, **[politics]{.underline}** (in the accepted or restricted
sense) **[is always tied to temporality, to objects and goals: it
reflects on the past, finds it deficient and seeks improvements for the
future. This is what enslaves politics to time or duration, just as it
enslaves human beings to a condition of working for and anticipating
ends and goals, and the elusive search for happiness]{.underline}**.
**[The present moment is denied or suppressed]{.underline}**. **[Being
is thus fragmented by role, career, position, place,
time]{.underline}**. For Bataille, **[the present -- an eternal moment
of infinite freedom, must not be denied.]{.underline}** **[Given this
constitu- tive fragmentation, politics, in the conventional sense, can
only fail. It must fail because, in a sense, it is designed to
fail,]{.underline}** just as ethics always fails -- neither really help
the lowly or excluded. **[They fail because their purpose is to defuse
the incendiary nature of being, to deny the scream of life, to prescribe
a slow, torturous neutralisation of life mortgaged against the future.
The future always belongs to those with power; it is the now which must
be seized. Bataille's 'politics' is a politics of community, of an
'impossible' community]{.underline}**. Though **[Bataille]{.underline}**
**[rejects parliamentary democracy and its political systems, parties
and organisations as barriers to freedom, along with all utopian
attempts to reform or ameliorate the existing system, it does not follow
that his thought is apolitical as some have charged. Bataille's
revolutionary thinking on the political envisages a different world, a
fundamentally altered society,]{.underline}** and an altered or 'other'
commu- nism (Bataille, in Mitchell & Winfree, 2009, p. 205). Far from
giving up on these hopes, Bataille turned to mysticism and to eroticism
**[to deepen this search for revolutionary
transformation]{.underline}**. [Mysticism and eroticism do indeed open
new worlds, worlds radically other than that of productive, servile
labour and the demands of capitalist accumulation.]{.underline}

### Positivism

#### To take an empirical or positivistic view of the radical singularities we encounter is an attempt to bring stability to becoming that robs them of their value 

**Massumi 17 (Brian, social theorist, writer, philosopher, and professor
in the Communications Department at the University of Montreal, chapter
14 of "General Ecology: The New Ecological Paradigm", by Eric Hörl,
titled "Virtual Ecology and the Question of Value". P 349-350. May 4,
2017) //**

Ruyer's second point about color and value concerns a notion that has
quietly slipped into this discussion along the way: the circumstances.
According to Ruyer, [the circumstances of an actualization, the
conditions calling for a potential's appearing, **are not sufficient to
explain the quality** that appears]{.underline}.18 You can describe what
conditions are necessary for the appearance of red until you're blue in
the face, and you will still not be able to convey to a color-blind
person what red is, such as it is, in contradistinction to orange,
yellow, and green. The bodily conditions of a color-blind person's
vision do not "want" any red. They "some" the color spectrum otherwise.
Red's power of appearing abides them. Colors are akin to pornography:
you only know one when you see it. [Qualities of experience are
subjective, but not in the sense of belonging only to a subject or
occurring in a mind. They are subjective in the sense that they have a
character. **They are their character.** There is nothing to explain
about "what" they are other than that character, such as it is. Their
appearance tells all. There is nothing "behind" the qualitative
character exhibited in their appearance that would explain what they are
any better than the appearing of the character explains itself. In
fact**, explanations of what lies behind the appearance are more apt to
lose the quality than present it better**. A complete account of the
physical and physiological conditions behind the appearance]{.underline}
of red [includes many things]{.underline}---red excluded. This is for
the simple reason, as Whitehead observes, stating the obvious, that the
wavelengths of light around which the physical side of the explanation
centers have no color in and of themselves.19 The same could be said of
the physiological side of the equation: electrical nerve impulses are no
more colorful than photon streams. This last point is crucial, because
it extends the argument to all qualities of experience. [Every quality
of experience self-explanatorily **exceeds its empirical conditions**.
This means that a scientific explanation, although true as far as it
goes, does not fully account for the occasion. An empirical explanation
is a reductive abstraction that focuses on only certain of the elements
involved (those capable of being quantified with the regularity of a
law). Empirical explanation selects for how the occasion is
quantitatively. The "how" of empirical explanation is a selective focus
on a lawfully select "some" of the factors involved, arrived at
precisely by subtracting the defining character of the occasion from
it:]{.underline} the scientific explanation of the red of the sunset
begins by bracketing redness, the qualitativeness of red. It takes red's
qualitative nature for selfexplanatory---which it is. But what it
forgets is Whitehead's fundamental point that [the occasion as explained
by that defining character is more concrete than the scientific fact
extracted (abstracted) from it]{.underline}.20 Who would even think of
explaining red scientifically if they had never seen it? The empirical
explanation "hows" itself into an acquired color-blindness. When it sees
red, [it just sees]{.underline} red, such [as it is---and proceeds to
explain away that experiential fact with an abstractive explanation of
how it came to be.]{.underline} The implications of this for
neuropsychology, and its humanities cousins like neuroaesthetics, are
grave. Also [grave are the consequences for historical analysis, to the
extent that it fashions itself an empirical enterprise, for example
employing a linear cause-effect framework for "how" things came about
modeled directly or indirectly on scientific notions of causality.
History has to acknowledge that subjective and the qualitative are
always wanting, and that the concrete facts of history exhibit a
qualitative form of self-explanation. Any **explanation bracketing this
qualitative reality is deadeningly incomplete**, because to explain away
the qualitative factors of experience is to explain away potential. The
fact that a quality of experience appears under certain requisite
conditions in no way detracts from its being such as it, positively all
of its subjective itself. The myriad circumstantial factors of an
occasion come together in such as way as to call to, and call forth, a
defining qualitative character. But they do not make the
quality.]{.underline} When red appears here, [it will always already
have appeared elsewhere, at another moment of time, and will no doubt
appear elsewhen in another place. In its abiding power of
appearing]{.underline}, red is ubiquitously unmade. [**It is
always-already (in potential).** It does not emerge from its conditions.
It appears for them, when called. It fills their want with its
self-explaining.]{.underline} In fact, [its self-explaining is in a
sense more concretely explanatory of the circumstances than they are of
it]{.underline}: the red of the sunset makes apparent what this occasion
is all about. [The character]{.underline} red [characterizes the
complete occasion.]{.underline}

### Productivity

#### Education and white capitalism isolates unproductive subjects and inoculates them with "useful" knowledge that only serves to strip students of their autonomy -- the logic of waste, of expenditure, is a dialectic indictment of whiteness and pre-determination

THEORY of EXPENDITURE: Transforming labor, and consequently [student
work, requires a revolutionary disposition toward relations of
production]{.underline}. In particular. it is imperative that
**[educators link the transformation of the economy with a critique of
whiteness]{.underline}**. However. th[eories of whiteness must be linked
to the idea that capitalism is not only the exploitation of knowledge
for proﬁts, but the simultaneous repression of expenditure]{.underline},
or what Georges Bataille (1997, 1991. 1988, 1985) describes as the human
proclivity to expend energy and not to accumulate it. [Transformation of
labor produces social relations that ﬂourish in conditions free of
alienation and exploitation.]{.underline} A discourse on production must
also consider alternative theoretical frameworks to explain students'
inner experiences and the knowledge they gain from them. [Transforming
relations of production allows students]{.underline}, as concrete
subjects, [to experience schooling in new ways,]{.underline} but
Bataille's theory of expenditure provides a general framework that
explains how we come to know these inner experiences themselves, a
theory [that functions not within the logic of production, but within
that of waste.]{.underline} As Bataille (1988) explains. \"On the
surface of the globe, for living matter in general, **[energy is always
in excess]{.underline}**; the question is always posed in terms of
extravagance. The choice is limited to how the wealth is to be
squandered\...The general movement of exudation (of waste) of living
matter implies him \[sic\], and he cannot stop it;\...it destines him,
in a privileged way. to that glorious operation. to useless consumption.
The latter cannot accumulate limitlessly in the productive forces;
eventually, like a river into the sea, it is bound to escape us and be
lost to us." (23; emphasis in the original). [**Schools accumulate
useful knowledge to the point where they cannot hold it.** Students
memorize, tabulate, and synthesize knowledge for future-oriented
purposes.]{.underline} [Eventually, unproductive student behavior erupts
and then spreads as students resist and rebel against work as a guiding
prnciple.]{.underline} The conventional explanation for disruptive
student behavior is "unproductivity." [Resistant students are either
alienated or lazy, and they willfully opt out of work]{.underline}.
Bataillean pedagogy understands this to be a state of wasteful activity
that cannot be fully explained by a productivist logic. [It represents
the "blind spot" of the discourse on work]{.underline}. Bataille's
pedagogy attempts to transgress the utility of current school knowledge.
[Educators isolate unproductive students from their peers to ensure that
they "do their work\" or detain them after school to give them extra
work]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [what escapes our understanding is the
principle of expenditure, or how students squander schoolwork for no
apparentl]{.underline}y useful or productive [reason]{.underline}. The
[theory of expenditure does not deny the presence of work]{.underline}.
let alone the importance of liberated labor. **[It acknowledges the
production of life for purposes of subsistence, survival. and
improvement of the species.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the modified
theory of expenditure we are presenting recognizes the importance of
revolutionizing student work as part of an overall transformation of
social life. In fact, Bataille (1997) clariﬁes, "Class struggle becomes
the grandest form of social expenditure when it is taken up again and
developed, this time on the part of the workers, and on such a scale
that it threatens the very existence of the masters" (178). [It is at
this intersection between work and non-work that we locate a revolution
both of student work and waste. injected in **this dialectic is the
indictment of whiteness as an ideology that alienates students from real
knowledge**]{.underline} as well as preventing them from rejoicing in
the event of knowing, unfettered from utilitarian concerns. School
knowledge has become not only a commodity in the Marxian sense, but has
taken on the quality of a thing that exists for other things. And as
things go, **[school knowledge is deemed useful for something outside of
itself. to fulﬁll a destiny that has been predetermined, such as grades
or higher education]{.underline}**. Bataille's perspective decries this
utilitarian condition wherein students are subjected to schoolwork that
apparently has no intrinsic worth but an exchange value in the markets
of white capitalism.

### Race

#### White fascism works as a territorial control of expenditure -- whiteness maps excess onto colored bodies as genocide, as a deferral of fears about itself through excessive drives, as a divestment of self-expression -- war becomes whiteness' potlatch gift

**McLaren, Leonardo, and Allen 2000** (Peter, Zeus, Ricky Lee, McLaren
is a Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies in the College of
Educational Studies at Chapman University. Leonardo is a professor with
a Ph.D. in Education and B.A. in English from UCLA.Allen is a professor

and Policy*, pg 120-121, accessed 7/10/17, EHL)

[White fascism is]{.underline} not only **[the enforcement of white
territorial control of the means of production]{.underline}**. It is
also [the simultaneous policing of excess,]{.underline} [of **curbing
expenditure and revelry**]{.underline} (not to motion ribaldry[) where
these may threaten the puritanical code of white
governmentality.]{.underline} How many examples do we have of the
carnivalesque activity, outlawry, and social brigandage of student
behavior quelled by the repressive power of state or local police?
Celebration is confused for lawlessness as the antiriot unit marches
into the potlatch to subdue its energy. [School classrooms function
under this sign of **general repression** where quietude is valued over
movement and vitality.]{.underline} Yet shit the scene to a crowded
hallway or students on their way to their lockers and the noise deafens
even the hard of hearing. **[White fascism is as much about the control
of expenditure as it is the control of the means of
production]{.underline}**. [As an apparatus of whiteness, schools become
places of the saving of energy rather than the spending of
it.]{.underline} It should be plain to see that [white capitalism has
encoded the colored body as a site of excess.]{.underline} To the white
fascist. [black students (especially males) have become the site of
super-sexuality and the Latina body a site of super
reproduction.]{.underline} On the other hand. [the white body has been
constructed as the site of rationality and savings]{.underline}. The
white body is almost non-sexualized. [This **erotic economy of "excess"
is linked to a genocidal tendency in the history and geography of
whiteness** to the extent that white ideology has been involved in
consistent crimes against the eroticized other.]{.underline} T[he
oppression of the sexual other is evidence of a certain repression of
the expenditure that whiteness represses in itself.]{.underline} That
is, [whiteness recognizes an excess beyond productivity but fails to
squander it, fearing the ecstatic consequences of such a
waste.]{.underline} It is a [vicarious living]{.underline} of sorts that
[robs whiteness of any life]{.underline} of its own. [It]{.underline} is
a mitigated. surreptitious experience that [**partitions** **the
erotic**]{.underline}---that is. the irreducible experience---**[into
fantasies rather than participating in its flows]{.underline}**. **[It
is a projection of what whiteness fears about itself and ﬁlls to
understand: a certain excessive drive.]{.underline}** This may sound
like the eroticization of the racialized subject represented in the
white imaginary. For it seems a [standard white discourse to portray the
other as a site of excess.]{.underline} However, remaining consistent
with Bataille's theory, [expenditure is a general economy that inheres
in all humans. It]{.underline} is not an economic drive particular to
non-Western societies, but one that [ﬁnds its expression in them, and
its repression in whiteness]{.underline}. Simple life forms excrete
waste, factories spew smoke, and stars explode as supernova only to give
birth to new star formations from leftover stellar material. In as much
as capitalism commodities any and all social spaces for proﬁt,
[**whiteness refuses to divest itself of excess** but saves it for
further growth, forestalling its inevitable and disastrous expression.
Wars, riots, and civil unrest are today's social potlatch.]{.underline}

### Sexuality

#### Sexuality inextricable correlates with violence and the right to kill exercised by the government. The sovereign world produces a luxurious death and constitutes the structure of death as it inhabits the world.

**Baudrillard, 76** (Jean, Sociologist, philosopher, bataillian scholor.
Symbolic exchange and death, pgs. 154-156)/

Despite its radicality, the psychoanalytic vision of death remains an
insufficient vision: the pulsions are constrained by repetition, its
perspective bears on a final equilibrium within the inorganic continuum,
eliminating differences and intensities following an involution towards
the lowest point; an entropy of death, pulsional conservatism,
equilibrium in the absence of Nirvana. [This theory manifests certain
affinities with Malthusian political economy, the objective of which is
to protect oneself against death. For political economy only exists by
default: death is its blind spot, the absence haunting all its
calculations. And the absence of death alone permits the exchange of
values and the play of equivalences.]{.underline} [An infinitesimal
injection of death would immediately create such excess and ambivalence
that the play of value would completely collapse.]{.underline} Political
economy is an economy of death, because it economises on death and
buries it under its discourse. The death drive falls into the opposite
category: it is the discourse of death as the insurmountable finality.
This discourse is oppositional but complementary, for if political
economy is indeed Nirvana (the infinite accumulation and reproduction of
dead value), then the death drive denounces its truth, at the same time
as subjecting it to absolute derision. It does this, however, in the
terms of the system itself, by idealising death as a drive (as an
objective finality). As such, the death drive is the current system\'s
most radical negative, but even it simply holds up a mirror to the
funereal imaginary of political economy. [Instead of establishing death
as the regulator of tensions and an equilibrium function, as the economy
of the pulsion, Bataille introduces it in the opposite sense, as the
paroxysm of exchanges, superabundance and excess. Death as excess,
always already there, proves that life is only defective when death has
taken it hostage, that life only exists in bursts and in exchanges with
death, if it is not condemned to the discontinuity of value and
therefore to absolute deficit.]{.underline} \'To will that there be life
only is to make sure that there is only death.\' The idea that death is
not at all a breakdown of life, that it is willed by life itself, and
that the delirial (economic) phantasm of eliminating it is equivalent to
implanting it in the heart of life itself this time as an endless
mournful nothingness. Biologically, [\'\[t\]he idea of a world where
human life might be artificially prolonged has a nightmare quality about
it\']{.underline} (G. Bataille, Eroticism \[2nd edn, tr. M. Dalwood,
London: Marion Boyars, 1987\], p. 101[), but symbolically above all; and
here the nightmare is no longer a simple possibility, but the reality we
live at every instant: death]{.underline} (excess, ambivalence, gift,
sacrifice, expenditure and the paroxysm), and so real life is absent
from it. [We renounce dying and accumulate instead of losing ourselves:
Not only do we renounce death, but also we let our desire, which is
really the desire to die, lay hold of its object and we keep it while we
live on. We enrich our life instead of losing it.]{.underline}
(Eroticism, p. 142) Here, luxury and prodigality predominate over
functional calculation, just as death predominates over life as the
unilateral finality of production and accumulation: On a comprehensive
view, human life strives towards prodigality to the point of anguish, to
the point where the anguish becomes unbearable. The rest is mere
moralising chatter. . . . A febrile unrest within us asks death to wreak
its havoc at our expense. (ibid., p. 60) [Death and sexuality, instead
of confronting each other as antagonistic principles]{.underline}
(Freud), [are exchanged in the same cycle, in the same cyclical
revolution of continuity. Death is not the \'price\' of sexuality the
sort of equivalence one finds in every theory of complex living
beings]{.underline} (the infusorium is itself immortal and asexual) [nor
is sexuality a simple detour on the way to death, as in Civilisation and
its Discontents: they exchange their energies and excite each other.
Neither has its own specific economy: life and death only fall under the
sway of a single economy if they are separated; once they are mixed,
they pass beyond economics altogether, into festivity and
loss]{.underline} (eroticism according to Bataille): [\[W\]e can no
longer differentiate between sexuality and death]{.underline} \[,
which\] are simply the culminating points of the festival nature
celebrates, with the inexhaustible multitude of living beings, both of
them signifying the boundless wastage of nature\'s resources as opposed
to the urge to live on characteristic of every living creature.
(Eroticism, p. 61) This festivity takes place because it reinstates the
cycle where penury imposes the linear economy of duration, because it
reinstates a cyclical revolution of life and death where Freud augurs no
other issue than the repetitive involution of death. In Bataille, then,
there is a vision of death as a principle of excess and an anti-economy.
[Hence the metaphor of luxury and the luxurious character of death. Only
sumptuous and useless expenditure has meaning; the economy has no
meaning, it is only a residue that has been made into the law of life,
whereas wealth lies in the luxurious exchange of death: sacrifice, the
\'accursed share\', escaping investment and equivalence, can only be
annihilated. If life is only a need to survive at any cost, then
annihilation is a priceless luxury. In a system where life is ruled by
value and utility, death becomes a useless luxury, and the only
alternative. In Bataille, this luxurious conjunction of sex and death
figures under the sign of continuity, in opposition to the discontinuous
economy of individual existences.]{.underline} Finality belongs in the
discontinuous order, where discontinuous beings secrete finality, all
sorts of finalities, which amount to only one: their own death. We are
discontinuous beings, individuals who perish in isolation in the midst
of an incomprehensible adventure, but we yearn for our lost continuity.
(Eroticism, p. 15) Death itself is without finalities; in eroticism, the
finality of the individual being is put back into question: What does
physical eroticism signify if not a violation of the very being of its
practitioners . . . ? The whole business of eroticism is to destroy the
self-contained character of the participants as they are in their normal
lives. (ibid., p. 17) [Erotic nakedness is equal to death insofar as it
inaugurates a state of communication, loss of identity and fusion. The
fascination of the dissolution of constituted forms]{.underline}: such
is Eros (pace Freud, for whom Eros binds energies, federates them into
ever larger unities). In death, as in Eros, it is a matter of
introducing all possible continuity into discontinuity, a game of
complete continuity. It is in this sense that \'death, the rupture of
the discontinuous individualities to which we cleave in terror, stands
there before us more real than life itself\' (ibid., p. 19). Freud says
exactly the same thing, but by default. It is no longer a question of
the same death.

### STEM (Science) 

#### The perpetuation of scientific knowledge invests in the general economy and relies on the premises of utility and denies the inner experience of the subject

**Pawlett 15 (William, Senior Lecturer in the School of Law, Social
Sciences and Communication at the University of Wolverhampton, "Georges
Bataille: Sacred and Society", General Economy and Sovereignty, p 89-90,
January 30, 2015) /**

Restricted economies and the knowledge they generate are absolutely
vital and indispensable for society and for thought. Yet, [restricted
economies cannot function without erecting limits and boundaries, and
there will always be excesses and indeterminacies permeating these
boundaries in any particular system. Indeed, the erection of a boundary
or limit itself generates an 'excess' beyond that limit. Restricted
economies 'work' only by drawing,]{.underline} selectively and
discretely [upon]{.underline} their 'outside' -- [the realm of general
economy]{.underline} -- and by simultaneously denying that they border
an irreducible 'outside'. The restricted economies of academic
disciplines are generally happy to admit that they have limits, of a
fuzzy sort, but assume that beyond 'their' limit another academic
discipline picks up the baton. For example, sociology may defer to
psychology and to biology where the functioning of the individual psyche
or of the body are concerned. In concert, [academic disciplines purport
to offer a seamless and limitless coverage of human experience.
Bataille's contention is that there are inherent and irreducible
excesses, excesses which must be expelled as a precondition for the
scientific enterprise to begin. **Science is**, for Bataille,
**restricted by its underlying foundation in utility -- ultimately in
the profane realm -- so that all sciences must accumulate knowledge that
is of use to society**. The accursed share, that which cannot be reduced
to the utilitarian project of scientific thought, is manifest in
paradox, anomaly and in the failure to erect meaningful rather than
simply useful foundations for knowledge]{.underline}. Further, for
Bataille, [**the subjective or inner experiences** of the
thinker]{.underline} -- his or her [experiences of wonder, inspiration,
mystery, despair and ecstasy -- are experiences that **can never be
formalized as scientific knowledge, yet they are the source from which
all scientific knowledge is generated**: the pre- or non-foundations of
the scientific enterprise]{.underline}. At the level of thought or
enquiry, [general economic thinking affirms and confronts the accursed
share, where restricted economies deny it or avoid confronting its
manifestations. The implications of the accursed share become
increasingly complex and problematic when we consider human groups and
societies]{.underline}. In support of his law of general economy,
[Bataille outlines a social anthropology of archaic societies which, he
argues, made the expenditure of excess energy and wealth their
fundamental dynamic through festivals, feasts and sacrificial
rites]{.underline} (Bataille, 1988a, pp. 45--77). Bataille's argument is
that [by expending excess in collective, ritual practices which suspend
everyday, productive existence, excess energy can bind beings and
communities: the accursed share is devoted to glory and sumptuary
activities and so social life is enriched. In contrast, modern societies
have, by and large, lost the capacity for glorious, communal
expenditures]{.underline} because wealth is expropriated and 'owned' by
elites for their individual and private pleasure.

### Violence/Hierarchies

#### Our innate desire to destroy the animal within us is what causes us to want to dominate others, therefore creating racial and class hierarchies that cause violence. 

**Rowe 17.** James, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at the
University of Victoria. "Georges Bataille, Chögyam Trungpa, and Radical
Transformation: Theorizing the Political Value of Mindfulness", The
Arrow: A Journal of Wakeful Society, Culture, and Politics, 4(2) \|

[What possibly could Bataille, the controversial author of pornographic
novels, have in common with Trungpa, a meditation master trained in
monastic Tibet?]{.underline} e resonances are surprisingly plentiful.
Indeed, cul- tural theorist Marcus Boon recently called Trungpa the
"most Batail- lean of contemporary Tibetan teachers."11 To reverse the
comparison, we could also say that Bataille was a particularly
"Trungpian" European philosopher. Bataille's interest in Tibetan culture
was longstanding. He trained in the language, expressed interest in
travelling to the country, and planned to write a book on tantra.12
Besides their shared appreci- ation for tantric practice and the sacred
potential of carnal pleasures like love-making and liquor, these
apparently disparate thinkers are primarily linked by their shared
emphasis on what I will call existential resentment, when explaining
worldly challenges like economic inequal- ity and nuclear build-up. By
existential resentment, I mean the felt smallness that humans can feel
in the face of our nite and eshy existence.13 [Both Bataille and
Trungpa, in their respective works, articulate how easy it is for humans
to feel small and servile in the face of a contingent existence, and how
this felt servility often fuels compensatory desires for aggrandizement
and domination, desires with profound material e ects.]{.underline} For
Trungpa, we struggle with a "fear of death, fear of oneself, and fear of
others" that fuels aggressive behavior.[14 Similarly, Bataille sees
humanity as "re- volting intimately against the fact of dying, generally
mistrusting the body, that is, having a deep mistrust of what is
accidental, natural, perishable."15 This mistrust fuels efforts to best
others as a way of com- pensating for the lack of power and control we
can feel in the face of decay.]{.underline} Both Trungpa and Bataille
draw a strong causal link between existential resentment and dominative
social relations. Bataille and Trungpa's resonant approaches to the
origins and ces- sation of domination complement each other in vital
ways. Bataille is clearer than Trungpa, for example, in linking
existential rancor to spe- ci c forms of systemic domination. [For
Bataille, "an active intention to surpass and destroy animal nature
within us" is responsible for the creation of racial and class
hierarchies; social distinctions that are estab- lished to help the
elect feel in control, at the top of the heap, removed from the
domineering muck of nature.]{.underline} Trungpa, on the other hand,
tends to use more general terms like "chaos" and "aggression" when
describing systemic challenges.16 [A strength of Bataille's analysis is
the direct link he makes between existential resentment and particular
sys- temic challenges such as class exploitation and
racism.]{.underline} A key strength of Trungpa's corpus, however, is the
re ned path of contemplative practice he o ers for transforming
existential resentment into gratitude and appreciation for earthly life.
For Trungpa "medita- tion practice is regarded as a good and in fact
excellent way to overcome warfare in the world: our own warfare as well
as greater warfare."17 Bataille meditated himself, and was one of the
first Euro-American philosophers to take mind-body practices seriously
as tools for individ- ual and cultural transformation. The actual
meditations he developed, unfortunately, have limited transformative
value.18 While Bataille offers a clearer existential diagnosis of
systemic challenges, Trungpa's body of teachings and methodology for
treatment are more robust[. Bataille's rich theoretical work, however,
can help inform the teach- ing of meditation in social movements and in
the broader culture.]{.underline} To concretize this point, I put
Bataille's materialist account of earthly rich- ness into conversation
with Trungpa's meditations on "basic goodness." Before turning to this
comparative work, I focus the beginning and middle sections of this
essay on Bataille and Trungpa's respective ex- planations for
domination, and why they both see existential change strategies like
meditation---and other methods for transforming the self and our
experience of the world---as integral to radical social trans-
formation. While a key in uence for better-known theorists like Michel
Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler, Bataille remains a
marginal gure in most political theory. As Robyn Marasco recently noted,
"precious little has been said about Bataille as a resource for
philosophical cri- tique and political theory."19 Bataille's work,
meanwhile, is teeming with insights, especially ones that bear directly
on the relationship be- tween contemplative practice and social change.
Deeply in influenced by Eastern philosophy, Bataille is representative
of a centuries-old tradition in Euro-American philosophy of drawing on
Buddhist ideas.20 Like Buddhist philosophers, Bataille offers an ex-
planation of strife that is rooted in human resistance to the contin-
gency and finitude of existence. But his account, while influenced by
Buddhism, more directly links human dissatisfaction with mortality to
systemic domination, particularly along the axes of race and class.
Because of Bataille's analysis of domination, he is one of the first Eu-
ropean philosophers to take mind-body practices seriously as tools for
cultural and political change. [Bataille is a vital---if sometimes
unset- tling---ally in ongoing e orts to better understand how
contemplative praxis relates to social change. Putting Bataille's
thought to use for Left political theory and prac- tice is not a
straightforward process.]{.underline}21 A number of his interests were
outrageous (human sacrifice, necrophilia, and orgiastic debauchery) and
are not easily reconciled with Leftist morality, or most moral con-
ventions for that matter.22 Bataille's transgressive pursuits help
explain why such a generative philosopher remains relatively marginal.23
But while outrageous, Bataille's intellectual and lived transgressions
were intelligible. One need not endorse Bataille's darker proclivities
to ap- preciate his general encouragement of practices that might better
align cultures with the always- fleeting present and transform
existential re- sentment into earthly affirmation. [Bataille's
sometimes-fumbling search for micropolitical strategies that work on the
existential plane (fears, af- fects, habits) is sensible when we
consider his diagnosis of domination. Bataille's analysis of domination
is rooted in his study of the body, and the terror and shame human
animals can feel before it. The body is unpredictable: It leaks, expels,
hungers, fails, and ultimately dies.]{.underline} Our bodies are our
opening to life, but also to death. And this inevita- ble death seems to
suggest insigni cance before the putrefaction from which we come and
will one day return. Humans, Bataille writes in his masterwork The
Accursed Share, "\[appear\] to be the only animal to be ashamed of that
nature whence he comes, and from which he does not cease to have
departed."24 [We feel primal shame, according to Bataille, because the
decay we are conscious of suggests servility and baseness.25 is primary
disdain for animal nature, and our dependence upon it, spurs fantastical
e orts to dominate our bodies, each other, and the more-than-human-world
in attempts to o set felt servility with felt dominance. For Bataille,
much of human history can be read as a per- manent struggle against
animality.]{.underline}26 In e Accursed Share he observes that humanity
"resembles those parvenus who are ashamed of their humble origin. ey rid
themselves of anything suggesting it. What are the 'noble' and 'good'
families," he writes of upper class morality, "if not those in which
their lthy birth is the most carefully concealed?"27 One of the crucial
rationales for accumulating wealth, according to Bataille, is that
material riches help us distinguish ourselves not only from animality,
but also from those we take to be nature's proxies in our fantastical e
orts to dominate the nature we fear. [Proxies, in the Euro-American
context, have included Indigenous peoples, women, people of color, and
workers.]{.underline} These proxies have been discursive- ly linked to
animal nature and then materially controlled in e orts to provide
compensatory hits of dominion. For Bataille, "\[i\]t is not so much
wealth\... that distinguishes, that quali es socially, as it is the
greatest distance from animality."28 [We dominate our bodies and each
other in e orts to surpass and ultimately control our animality, our
impermanence. is desire to "destroy the animal nature within us," he
suggests, lurks behind many of our most vexing political and ecological
problems.]{.underline}29 In Bataille's view, the pull of existential
resentment is universal; it is a human strug- gle.30 He is attuned,
however, to the important mediating role played by culture. Individuals
and cultures relate to existential realities like impermanence in
multiple ways. Tibetan Buddhism, for example, of- fers meditative
practices for befriending the reality of death. [We are not destined to
resentfully interpret death as domineering, or to ee from felt servility
with fantasies of mastery.]{.underline} Bataille surveys multiple
cultures in e Accursed Share, but his en- gagement with Tibetan Buddhism
is most germane to this analysis. His musings on Tibetan Buddhism are
often selective and incomplete characterizations of the tradition, but
they nevertheless o er useful frames for transforming existential
resentment. Bataille saw the culture and economy of Tibet before the
Chinese invasion in 1959 as a glori- ous e ort to a rm the totality of
life, including death. He admired, for example, the Tibetan tantric
practice of meditating in graveyards.31 e bene t of these practices,
according to Bataille, is that if existential resentment leads to
compensatory self-seeking, then a rming the to- tality of life,
including death, can produce an ethos of generosity. Prior to China's
occupation, Tibetan wealth was poured into devel- oping an extensive
network of monasteries devoted to a religion that encourages openness to
the reality of death and the changeful present. In 1917, according to
rough estimates provided by British diplomat Charles Bell, monastic
budgets were double that of the government and eight times that of the
army.32 [In Bataille's view, Tibetan energetic and material investments
were successful in creating a culture that be- stows prestige upon
self-overcoming and compassion instead of upon avarice and
accumulation.]{.underline}33 Bataille's enthusiasm for Tibetan culture
was not ungrounded. ere were important material manifestations of
Buddhism's empha- sis on primordial richness and universal well-being
before the Chinese invasion. Because a majority of productive land was
under the Dalai Lama's sway, for example, the private enclosure of
common land that kick-started capitalism in Great Britain was less
imaginable and action- able in Tibet.34 And while land belonged to the
Dalai Lama, tax-paying peasants held relatively inalienable usufruct
rights, granting them open access to the means of subsistence. e
cultural priority that Tibetan Buddhism places on transforming
existential resentment into earthly a rmation does appear to have helped
nurture relatively equal access to land. Moreover, after the Chinese
Revolution in 1949, Tibetan intellec- tuals---including the current
Dalai Lama---hoped that modern social- ism could disrupt stubborn feudal
hierarchies that predated Buddhism's hold on political power, and could
better materialize the Buddhist em- phasis on universal well-being.35
Even after Communist China's colo- nization of Tibet, the Dalai Lama
still refers to himself as "half-Marx- ist, half-Buddhist."36 e Dalai
Lama's double allegiance is deserving of more analytical attention.
[Part of my argument in this essay is that the work of Georges Bataille,
the tantric communist, can support the de- velopment of Buddhist
socialism and the ongoing integration of medi- tative praxis into
secular and multi-faith social movements.]{.underline}37 Part of the
story that Bataille does not cover, however, is that Ti- bet still
experienced economic hierarchy, gender-based oppression, and corruption.
There was a class system, for example, that di erentiated monks,
aristocrats, peasants, nomads, and servants, as well as outcasts akin to
Indian "untouchables" who performed undesirable tasks such as
blacksmithing, butchering, and corpse disposal.38 Bataille was not
typically prone to idealism, but Tibet took his breath away; his account
of the country is marked by Orientalist idealization.39 According to
Donald Lopez Jr., Bataille's analysis ts within an overly simplistic Eu-
ro-American pattern of presenting Tibetan culture as a balm that can
"regenerate the West by showing us, prophetically, what we can be by
showing us what it had been."[40 Despite Bataille's romantic view of
Tibet, he was ultimately a tragic thinker. He did not hold to the
prospect of a utopian future where the "the pursuit of rank and war" is
perfectly transformed.]{.underline}41 Bataille evinc- es a tragic
radicalism; he locates drivers of domination in our existential
condition as animals that die, know we die, and easily feel fear and
ser- vility in light of inevitable decay. Since our mortality is hard
fact, com- pletely undoing compensatory desires for dominion is unlikely
in his estimation. [And yet by locating a root driver for
dominance-seeking, Bataille's work breaks ground for radical politics;
it offers a pathway towards increasing, if not perfect and nal,
liberation. One of the implications of Bataille's analysis is that
mind-body practices should become central, instead of merely
supplementary, to processes of transformative political change. Bataille
understood that moving from a culture that interprets death as a
domineering master to one a affirming mortality as a necessary movement
in the general gen- erosity of life requires practices that enable the
felt experience of basic richness.]{.underline}42

### Value

#### Your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint, condemning the world to the simulacral existence of peace and security, your acts of piety and pity are absurd, committed as if they were irresistible. Your promises are a life spent wandering the surface of the world with minimal intensity---life spent playing penny slots and drinking bud light instead of ever risking anything or buying the good shit. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time.

Perspectives in Baudrillard Studies, polity, ed. R. Bishop pg. 60-70)

Extending a conceit borrowed from Francois de Bernard, itself a
continuation of his own conceit, Baudrillard writes that the Iraq War is
a film: not like a film -- not a simile -- but film itself (rather like
the Gulf War is TV). The Iraq War has a "screenplay" which "has to be
fulfilled unerringly" (Intelligence of Evil, 124). Everything from
technical to financial materiel, including control of distribution
(similar to Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks with
their United Artists studio), has been mobilized for "The Iraq War: The
film." "In the end," Baudrillard argues, "operational war becomes an
enormous special effect; cinema becomes the paradigm of warfare, and we
can imagine it as 'real,' whereas it is merely the mirror of its
cinematic being" (ibid.). The audience of the Iraq War, in all of its
modes of delivery and distribution, then replicate the audience of The
Island. The implications of this replication at the level of the
political become rather obvious, but not necessarily so at first glance.
If the audience of The Island witnesses a self on screen no longer
accessible to them other than on screen, then the audience of the Iraq
War witnesses political action (technological, military, and economic)
no longer accessible to constituents of representational government
other than onscreen. As noted earlier, even those arenas usually
allotted to the general populace in representational governments have
been subsumed by the drive to Integral Reality as exemplified by the
global demonstrations against the invasion of Iraq that did nothing to
slow the attack and only filled up TV news shows with the performance of
dissent. The result is, according to Baudrillard, that "we are
henceforth dealing with the exercise of power in the pure state with no
concern for sovereignty or representation; with the Integral Reality of
negative power" (Intelligence of Evil, 120). More worrying, however,
might be the relationship between the simulation of cinematic experience
of the Iraq War and its relationship to the drive toward Integral
Reality, as delineated in The Intelligence of Evil, but foreshadowed
briefly in the Gulf War essays. The key connections here are those that
link simulation (or modeling) to pre-empting any phenomena, set of
values, or actions that might lead to an event, a disruption of the
drive to completion of the Real: here understood as the platitudes
operating under terms such as universal values, democracy, neoliberal
economic markets, etc. The entire apparatus of globalization processes
intends to perfect and complete the Real and the Good on its own terms
and with Universal Values as its justification. The relationship between
the global and the universal replicates that between technics and truth.
The Gulf War essays show how the fully mediated simulacral conflict of
the early 1990s fit the larger pattern of Cold War deterrence as another
means of waging conflict and thus realizing as completely as possible
the control of images and information (disinformation). On the
geopolitical scale, then, the purpose of wars is to rein in recalcitrant
regimes while sending messages to other potential foes about the
technological, military, and simulational power of the US: "the large
footprint" in the sand that the Pentagon invoked during the early period
of the Iraq War. Sending a message, of course, has long been a strategy
for exercising sovereignty. About the Gulf War, Baudrillard writes, "Our
wars have less to do with the confrontation of warriors than with the
domestication of the refractory forces on the planet, those
uncontrollable elements as the police would say, to which belong not
only Islam in its entirety but wild ethnic groups, minority languages,
etc. All that is singular and irreducible must be reduced and absorbed.
This is the law of democracy and the New World Order" (Gulf War, 86).
This is, of course, the project of simulation, the wresting of the event
in potentia from its potential and potential realization. The model and
the object merge to create one whole entity, as in the third order of
simulacra. Containment leads not just to control but also to osmosis, to
preventive measures rendering any further or similar outbreaks possible.
And all of it scripted ahead of time. The script demands that nothing
deviate from the script, a screenplay writer with some real clout at
last. The raw power of the integral drive is based, in Baudrillard's
argument, entirely on "the prevention and policing of events"
(Intelligence of Evil, 121), to fulfill the script's demands. This,
after all, was the justification for the pre-emptive nature of the Iraq
War, whose aim was nominally the prevention in advance of Saddam's use
of weapons of mass destruction. The models provided by intelligence and
tele-technological surveillance indicated variance from the global order
of Integral Reality and thus necessitated, in simplistic cause-effect
rationalization, the preventive measure known as war -- but only war
that is cinema: scripted, special effects, everything all in place and
safe when the lights go up. But the prevention now is universal,
absolute, no longer contained to war or security. "Anything that could
happen," Baudrillard argues, "anything that might take place is regarded
as terrorism. The rule, or the order, is that nothing can take place,
nothing is to occur any more. So anything that can occur must be
predicted in advance, exterminated in advance" (Hegarty, 2004: 147). And
this is what war has become: pre-emption, carrying Cold War logic to its
complete and completely (il)logical ends of absolute completion.
Everything is a threat that does not emerge from the order that controls
the spread of Integral Reality. Terrorism is "no longer at all religious
or ideological . . . it's all forms. So, in practice, it's total war,
maybe the fourth world war, or like Virilio said, a sort of planetary
civil war, as it's a coalition of all powers on the side of order
against all those who are potential terrorists. All populations are
virtually terrorist insofar as they have not been exterminated" (ibid.).
Baudrillard's analyses, rather like the Cold War doctrine that
maintained an enforced state of terror called mutually assured
destruction (MAD), might seem to leave us no room for maneuvering or
action of any kind. Yet, Death lurks in the systems he discusses, the
ones driving incessantly to completion and perfection, and Death
provides us hope, though, admittedly, a slim one. The systems generate
their own modes of destruction, an auto-destructivity that emerges from
the very processes that wish to exclude any resistance to them. In an
exceptionally prescient passage that can be linked directly to the Iraq
War, Baudrillard asserts: But this Integral Reality of power is also its
end. A power that is no longer based on anything other than the
prevention and policing of events, which no longer has political will
but the will to dispel ghosts, itself becomes ghostly and vulnerable.
Its virtual power -- its programming power in terms of software and the
like -- is total, but as a result it can no longer bring itself into
play, except against itself, by all kinds of internal failures. At the
height of its mastery, it can only lose face. (Intelligence of Evil,
121) The loss of face Baudrillard evokes here is not the result of
hubris, per se, but rather the effect of realizing exactly what one has
set out to achieve. The hermitic world of complete containment,
surveillance, and control, no matter how illusory, if successful, can
only ever result in yielding for itself no outside. Anything that
impedes the spread of this Integral Reality is co-opted or obliterated,
which is the position of "Islam" for the West. In its abstracted,
political sense, "Islam," which must be put in qualifying quotation
marks, materializes that which would and does oppose Integral Reality.
But this materialization will not be the force that undoes the drive to
completion; rather the seeds of its own demise are sown from within. A
drive for utter completion -- logically and redundantly -- can only end
when it is complete: a kind of systematized selfdestruction through
realization. The conditions that make Integral Reality possible, as well
as the goals it desires, therefore render it impossible to achieve and
undesirable to do so. Yet it persists, and more perniciously than ever,
despite the humiliating, bloody and intractable conflict in Iraq. The
salvation of theory in death, or the salvation that is death Although
death is pivotal to many whose work falls within the domain of critical
theory, Baudrillard's work, perhaps more so than others', articulates,
embodies, and enacts the role of Death within theoretical writing and
its relation to the political. Death, and especially the death drive in
Freud according to Baudrillard, does not provide any space for the
operation of dialectical co-option or reclamation. And it is this trait,
Death's absolute imperviousness to the dialectic, that makes it radical,
intractable, usable (Symbolic Exchange and Death, 151). Such is the
position that Baudrillard himself assumes within analyses of media,
simulation, the subject, the object, politics, war, economics, culture,
the event, theory itself, and thought. In relation to systems, the Death
that Baudrillard wishes to address functions in a two-fold manner: it is
what waits at "the term of the system" -- at its end -- and it is "the
symbolic extermination that stalks the system itself" (Symbolic Exchange
of Death, 5). Therefore Death is both internal to the system and its
"operational logic" and "a radical-finality" outside it. Only Death
operates both within and without the system (5). As such it carries the
mark of perfection (completion of the system's operation and project)
and the defectiveness inherently lurking within it. Death is ambiguity
and paradox made manifest, and is both the system's realization and its
impediment. Death resists modeling, the simulation. Its lack of
predictability and the difficulty in controlling it, in fact, resides at
the center of the various systems, policies, and logics that drive the
Cold War. Death is the event without compare and which must be elided at
all costs. Under the patriotic yet threatening rubrics of security,
safety, "our way of life," etc., the entire elaborate apparatus of the
Cold War was erected and launched, while also continuing with
intensified reverberations into the present -- all to ward off Death on
a scale hitherto the domain of Nature or the gods. Following a lead from
the poet Octavio Paz and sounding like an interlocutor of Paul
Virilio's, Baudrillard discusses Death, therefore, in terms of the
accident (Symbolic Exchange and Death, 160--6). For as Paz contends,
modern science and technology, including medicine, have converted
epidemics and natural catastrophes into explainable and controllable
phenomena. The rational order can explain and contain anything that
threatens it, as can Integral Reality (for which the rational order is
another metonym, as is the global). As such, Death becomes an accident
to be contained and controlled, explained and predicted. If Death equals
an accident, and accidents threaten the rational order, Baudrillard
argues, then Death-asaccident also threatens political sovereignty and
power, "hence the police presence at the scenes of catastrophe" (161).
Death is the disruption that destabilizes all that has been ordered and
made stable. At the height of the Cold War as an historical phenomenon,
the major powers relied heavily on a rational order that both players
acknowledged (at least between themselves) to be operational. This led
to the enforced and heavily armed stalemate of MAD, and with it arrived
the horrific spectacle of the nuclear accident, or the computer
accident. The accidental launch of the impossible exchange of missiles
would be, in rote pronouncements of certitude, "the only way" these
rational and sane nations would fire nuclear weapons: hence the many
examples of cultural representations of accidental nuclear war that
filled popular media (invoking worlds synonymous to the one portrayed as
the simulated wasteland in The Island). The import of simulation in
containing Death on a global scale can be seen in the supposed rational
containment of both the opposition and oneself. The simulated scenarios
of both war games and accidental launches, the modeling of events,
become a kind of necromantic or occult means of controlling unleashed
forces and foretelling possible futures in order to prevent the accident
(or the event) -- to prevent Death itself. The thought processes, or
mental make-up, required to plan and design large-scale modeling meant
to pre-empt accidents are themselves a kind of technology of thinking,
and this mental technicity comprises an important element in the
construction of Integral Reality. Simulation requires faith not in its
own verisimilitude but in its capacity to change events, even Death. The
US embodies this kind of faith and has from the Cold War to the present,
which, as such, becomes a target for many satiric novelists. One
particularly influenced by Baudrillard's ideas about simulation is Don
DeLillo, whose novel White Noise reads like a primer on the French
theorist's writings. One motif in the novel is a company called SIMUVAC,
which stands for "simulated evacuation." The company stages fake
evacuations for a variety of emergencies, including nuclear events,
complete with a theatrical or cinematic set of special effects:
uniforms, sound effects, smells, and blood (if required). The firm turns
up several times in the novel but makes its first, and most satirically
poignant, appearance during an actual emergency. In perfect
Baudrillardian fashion, the company, which operates solely with and for
simulation, uses a live emergency to practice (or simulate) its own
simulated emergencies, which is the commodity it packages and sells to
various government agencies. The protagonist of the novel asks a SIMUVAC
employee, in the midst of the actual crisis, to evaluate their
rehearsal. The SIMUVAC operative replies in darkly comedic fashion: The
insertion curve isn't as smooth as we would like. There's a probability
excess. Plus which we don't have our victims laid out where we we'd want
them if this was an actual simulation. In other words we're forced to
take our victims where we find them. We didn't get a jump on computer
traffic. Suddenly it just spilled out, three-dimensionally, all over the
landscape. You have to make allowances for the fact that Baudrillard,
Death, and Cold War Theory everything we see tonight is real. There's a
lot of polishing to do. But that's what this exercise is all about.
(DeLillo, 1985: 139) The passage contains beautiful parodic examples of
the vagaries that language suffers at the hands of bureaucrats, with
nonsense phrases passing as technical jargon, including "insertion
curve" and "probability excess," as well as the delightfully oxymoronic
"actual simulation." But beyond this parody, DeLillo evokes the
technicity of thought deeply embedded in Cold War America, the same
technicity that Baudrillard works through at multiple levels, to reveal
the deep investment in the power and control afforded by simulation. The
desirable element of simulation is, in fact, control, such as with body
placement, which is something actual disasters arrange without care or
consultation with the modelers. When the SIMUVAC employee claims that
things are in need of "polishing" because "everything we see tonight is
real," we witness the retreat into the comfortable delusion afforded by
simulation despite its no-nonsense claims to hard-nosed pragmatism --
"that's what this exercise is all about," he asserts. SIMUVAC, as a
company, markets readiness, the capacity to make a community alert and
prepared, but can only deliver on this promise as long as everything
remains contained in the model. (And if events do not remain neatly in
the model, then the company can use the "accident" to better refine
their simulation and techniques.) The same is true of governments, and
this is the fear of the accident -- and the fear the accident manifests
-- that Baudrillard (pace Paz) analyzes. Every sector of Integral
Reality lives in fear of events because they can "spill out,
three-dimensionally, all over the landscape," no longer in control of
the system. All that various institutions, systems, and technologies
promise to contain refuses to be contained. Such is the revenge of the
object, about which Baudrillard writes, and the intractability of that
which lies outside the systems of transparency and integration. Death
stalks the protective simulating enterprises from inside and out.
Baudrillard as a stylist of considerable skill and a rhetorician
well-steeped in the rhetorical tradition similarly mobilizes his writing
itself as Death in relation to the systems operative within academic
discourse. From the late 1960s on, his writings and books have deviated
rather widely from the conventions of sociological or philosophical
genres and academic writing by reaching into the humanistic essay
tradition (long since abandoned) and combining it with the most current
of pressing issues. What constitutes a standard argument within the
humanities and qualitative social sciences, what passes for knowledge
and knowledge formation and construction, depends heavily on the
adherence of a given work to these conventions. Baudrillard's textual
Deaths provide "fatal strategies" intended to stave off the actual death
of thought that can result from routinized, by-the-number, knowledge
formation. The aphoristic style, borrowed most directly from Nietzsche,
works in a nonlinear fashion that nonetheless makes consistent and
sustained arguments across his books as well as within them. Baudrillard
teases an idea, settles on a problematic, and pulls at its various
permutations, checking how it might work from one context to another. As
a result, his writing can be simultaneously readable and enjoyable while
also being difficult and frustrating. Like his friend Virilio, he does
not develop his argument in a full or linear fashion, instead allowing
for fragments, tangents, and hyperbole to carry thought off course and
place readers in a textual space that is comfortable (especially if they
have read nineteenthcentury philosophers) and discomfiting at the same
time. To this end, he resurrects outmoded philosophical discourse while
at the same time adding to it a late modernist poetic sensibility. The
latter quality emerges most obviously in his deployment of terms as
talismans of the moment of writing as well as terrain themselves for
inquiry: the strategic deployment of labels and phrases intended to make
us pay attention to their elasticity and formidable ability to
fascinate, illuminate, and instantiate a stability of unstable
phenomena. Baudrillard is always contemporary, his thoughts being
solidly grounded in the present, and his terminology is always embedded
in the current moment. He relies on older essayistic forms to structure
his thoughts and musings, which often appear as thoughts and musings,
i.e. slightly inchoate and coming into focus through the act of writing.
The processual quality of his style injects Death as that which cannot
be represented adequately into the deathly regimes of academic language
meted out by rote adherence to genre-driven formulae within academic
discursive practices. In an important sense, Baudrillard posits that
Death is the salvation of theory while also arguing for the salvation
that is Death. With the nuclear sword of Damocles dangling over our
heads ever since the explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we have
slipped into a constant state of imminent global death that no longer
seems like death, so swift and horrible will it be that it outstrips our
imagination. "If the bomb drops," he writes in America, "we shall
neither have the time to die nor any awareness of dying" (42). Echoing
the neo-Freudian psychoanalyst Ernst Becker, Baudrillard argues that
Death ostensibly has been removed from our horizon in the American Era,
and we, those who follow in America's global footsteps, have moved
easily and subtly into a state of daily ease and material comfort,
buffeted and protected by a staggering array of tele-technologies,
opto-electronics, and international ballistic missiles all meant to keep
Death at bay and survival at the forefront. Lost in this heady
combination of technological, intellectual, and economic materiel
mounted for sheer survival, of course, is life (43). Only that which is
alive can die, and our cocooned embrace of globalization, which in turn
cocoons and embraces us, leaves us with an existence that recalls the
prescient horror films of George Romero begun early in the Cold War: an
existence like that of zombies, neither alive nor dead, but frantically
and brainlessly consuming all in sight. Baudrillard rescues Death from
its purgatorial condition of "the not alive" or mere survival. And in
order to do so, he takes his cue from the masses who are the targets of
this weaponry and way of life, the enactors of this ethos of bland
avoidance and unthinking consumption. Their wholesale passivity to the
apparatus of survival -- from nuclear bunkers to Star Wars -- emerges
from a weariness of having been ceaselessly confronted with apocalyptic
visions since the first nuclear explosions in New Mexico and Japan, and
they "defend themselves with a lack of imagination" (America, 44). "The
masses' silent indifference to nuclear pathos (whether it comes from the
nuclear powers or from antinuclear campaigners) is therefore a great
sign of hope," he asserts, "and a political fact of great import" (44).
To understand Death as immanent within the system and without it, as
immanent within bios and zoe and without it, is to resist the simulation
of Death that hovers over our heads in the Cold War and the War on
Terror. The salvation of Death, which is also the salvation of
Baudrillard's writing, thought, and analyses, provides us with the means
of getting this specific brutal excess back into our collective frame of
reference, not for the sake of nihilism, but to resist the nihilism
built into all the projects of utter completion and realization that
have rendered politics, the subject, the object, thought, and theory as
simulation.

### Withdrawal -- Negative action 

#### All is war- including the agony of peace. The 1AC's call for arms-reduction, their heaping insistence on negative state actions, on correcting the wrongs of the past -- all of this is a subtle attempt to maintain a militarized mode of subjectivity, to be ultra-ethical uber-subjects whose call for peace licenses the annihilation of all inferior subjects. But the dissolution of subjectivity is inevitable.

acceptable as policing becomes by simple translation justified as
warfare.**]{.underline} [Dealing with the enemy becomes a mere extension
of police work.]{.underline} [In return, the domestic street is
notionally militarized.]{.underline} **[This slippage allows both war
and policing to be justified as mere analogies to one another: how can
you contest the war against terror when it is really just a version of
the police work that makes you feel safe in your home? And inversely,
how can you possibly doubt the legitimacy of policing when it is really
a version of the war fought against those who despise liberty and
threaten innocence?]{.underline}** 2. It is a truism to say that [each
war redefines the nature of war itself, due to changes in arms
technology, military organisation or geo-strategic history]{.underline}.
[The long war of terror is no exception, but what is most new about
it,]{.underline} and what makes it most fit its age, [is that it
promises **the erasure of the difference between war and peace, and
concomitantly between war and civil society:**]{.underline} [terrorists
and criminals swap identity, emerge anywhere at any time and are imputed
to share a hostility to the whole Western way of life.]{.underline} This
rhetorical slippage, however, confirms what many theorists of war have
been proposing in different ways for a long time. **[We will no longer
have war and peace in the future, but ever more complex entanglements of
one in the other, where social policy, diplomatic manipulation and
military strategy exchange characteristics, contriving enemies at home,
representing political antagonists abroad as criminals, and abolishing
not only the idea of a military frontier, but of warfare itself as
simply a matter of literal or possible armed conflict.]{.underline}** In
the future, [the question will be not \"Why did we choose war instead of
peace?\" but \"What configuration of the peace-war complex embroils us
now? \"]{.underline} 3. Discussing what is new about the \"new wars,\"
Herfried Munkler argues that in the wars that have developed in the
decolonised world: \"[military force and organised crime go increasingly
together.]{.underline}\"2He goes on: \"**[The new wars know no
distinction between combatants and non-combatants, nor are they fought
for any definite goals or purposes; they involve no temporal or spatial
limits on the use of violence]{.underline}**.\"[3In the low intensity,
asymmetrical conflicts]{.underline} Munkler sees as [typical of
contemporary war, war is without limits, and has no identifiable
outside, either in space or time.]{.underline} 4. The inverse of this
argument is Martin Shaw\'s identification of one of the key attributes
of \"[**the new Western way of war**\":]{.underline} \"The key
understanding, therefore, is that warfighting [**must be carried on
simultaneously with \'normal\' economics, politics and social life in
the West.** It is imperative it does not impact negatively on
these.]{.underline}\"**[4Western publics only tolerate a war that can be
co-ordinated seamlessly with peace. This is not an alienation of war
from social life, but its absolute co-ordination with it]{.underline}**.
[It is not here a question of war being kept hidden behind a screen of
peaceful social advancement from one day to the next. Instead, **war
under this dispensation becomes completely compatible with what we
conventionally understand as peace.**]{.underline} In the end, **[this
is what allows the complete saturation of society by war: the ability to
represent the normal unfolding of social life as relatively
undisturbed.]{.underline}** 5. In their discussion of the paradoxes of
global political governance, Dillon and Reid present a more complex
account of the inter-relationship between war and peace. Here **[liberal
governance both provokes and repudiates war]{.underline}**. They write:
\"It . . . seems obvious that the radical and [continuous transformation
of societies that global liberal governance so assiduously seeks must
constitute a significant contribution to the very violence that it
equally also deplores]{.underline}.\"5Here, **[global political
institutions which have charged themselves with the task of drawing
fragile states into the contemporary world of transparent and open
(especially financial) administration which makes them accessible to the
flow of international capital, unsettle societies enough that warfare is
risked, while equally bemoaning war as a sign of institutional
failure]{.underline}**. [The pressure put]{.underline}, for example, [on
the small states of the Western Pacific]{.underline} by local powers
like Australia both [aggravates communal tensions by destabilising
inherited power structures, while bemoaning the subsequent unrest as
symptomatic of cultures seen as ill-equipped for contemporary global
modernity.]{.underline} 6. Each of these accounts presents a different
insight into the various ways in which war and peace co-exist in the
contemporary. [**War totally infiltrates peace**, yet war is only
allowed when it confirms the apparent inviolability of
peace]{.underline}. **[The governance that insists on the
rationalisation and stabilisation of civic society stokes instability
and war]{.underline}**. [War is consistently incited in peace while
being simultaneously alienated from it.]{.underline} **[Peace is
administered in such a way that war presses to return, always and
everywhere.]{.underline}** But how are we to theorise this possibly
epoch-making development? How do our philosophies of war and peace allow
us to represent and consider this development and its consequences for
the future global polity and for the identity of civil society, which,
since Hobbes at least has always relied on the institution of social
peace through the containment of war as its touchstone? The aim of this
paper is to present a strand of thinking in modern and postmodern
cultural theory that essays a formulation of the war/peace complex that
history now so clearly proposes to us. It is in the long acknowledged
but under-investigated connection between Georges Bataille and Jacques
Derrida that one version of the reformulation of the war/peace complex
becomes articulable. 7. Is there a way of thinking the relationship
between war and civil society that recognises the frontier between them
as unfixed and problematic? [The most canonical statement about war in
the Western tradition is von Clausewitz\'s \"War is a mere continuation
of policy by other means.\"]{.underline}6 Clausewitz\'s statement was
given new life in 1976 by Foucault\'s lecture series at the College de
France, published in 2003 in English as Society Must be Defended.
Foucault cheekily reverses Clausewitz\'s statement in order to argue
that [European history has been traditionally dominated by attempts at
chronicling, elucidating or advancing universal ideologies of
sovereignty]{.underline} (he quotes approvingly Petrarch\'s complaint:
\"Is there nothing more to history than the praise of Rome?\"7).
According to Foucault, [this sovereign history as the progress of
sovereignty has been at the expense of another continuity which
understands history as the unresolved agony of incoherent and particular
struggles between bitter and nostalgic agents, who have no interest in
theories of constitutional legitimation]{.underline}, but whose aim is
merely to recover what they imagine as their lost traditional rights.
\"**[Politics is the continuation of war by other
means]{.underline}**,\"8 Foucault summarises. 8. War, society,
continuity. Whichever way you go in this chiasmus a conceptual problem
emerges: [what does it mean that something is a continuation of
something else? It is both an advance beyond, and a preservation,
without becoming a dialectical sublation.]{.underline} It may be simply
one thing as it appears to be something else. Hence the triumphal,
gnomic way in which the words emerge: **[you may think that what you\'re
doing is politics, or conventional social life, but it is \"really\"
war.]{.underline}** [The continuity preserves the purpose and spirit,
but not the identity and place of that which it continues, but the
thinker sees through the appearance and spies the reality.]{.underline}
There must be [a commonality of substance, but an inconsistency in
appearance]{.underline} between the two ends of the relation. 9. These
two statements then are not as simple as they appear. They announce a
complex relationship between similarity and difference: **[two things
that do not appear to be the same, and are normally even taken to be
opposites (war and society/politics) are in fact expressions, or
manifestations of a logic that remains consistent]{.underline}**. Yet,
this logic is not single, because it needs two distinct forms in which
to appear, and **[because of the inconsistency between them, it is able
to conceal itself, to the point where it needs to be revealed by
thought]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the revealing of the
pseudo-contradiction is not its reduction. The contradiction must
persist. The continuity requires it. Otherwise, the war/society complex
could not operate as it does. Both the contradiction and the continuity
are suspended in one another, without the dynamic relationship between
them really being explained. Which appears as what, for example? Is the
continuity what we experience, and the contradiction invisible, or is it
the other way round? The formulations provided by both Clausewitz and
Foucault although spectacular, are curiously inarticulate, or at least
incomplete. They overcome the insistent reduction of war to a simple
deed done by a subject, but they obscure the complex and unstable
relationship between war and civil society at the very point where its
difficult nature may be about to reveal itself. In other words, they
alert us to the unstable relationship between war and civil society that
we need to unravel in order to understand what war is becoming for us,
but they do not really provide an account of how the relationship
actually operates. 10. The challenge then is to find another way of
thinking about the relationship between war and civil society, one that
neither disaggregates them in a simple way, so that war appears
something intermittent in the unfolding of social relations, something
which [the enduring aggression of post-Enlightenment cultures (as
imperialism fades into a martialised globalisation in the name of the
Enlightenment itself) and their radical generalisation of war as a model
of government policy and social life]{.underline} makes less and less
convincing; nor as a mere cynical, striking but not particularly
insightful proverbialism that risks erasing the fundamental difference -
war\'s eruptive and dramatic otherness - which makes war acceptable,
palatable, even popular. My investigation will proceed by tracing a way
of considering war from Bataille\'s economic thinking, through
Derrida\'s consideration of the relationship between calculability and
incalculability and to his discussions of the nature of war itself. [War
cannot be seen as simply something separate from society, nor as simply
the same as it.]{.underline} These readings aim to provide an account of
war that builds on the intuition of their relationship in Clausewitz and
Foucault, while doing more to explain the logic of the dynamic they do
not theorise, and also how that dynamic may offer some way of imagining
the limits of war. 11. **[The palatability of war depends on a
consistent ability to reconstruct social life as in at least a
disjunctive relationship with war]{.underline}**, if not a
contradiction. [The logic of Western societies and citizens as somehow
innocent has been the most consistent moral theme of the \"war of
terrors\" that has unfolded since September 11]{.underline}, 2001.
**[How can cultures with an undeniable history of warfare - against
populations, identities, cultures, economic traditions, species,
ecologies, and even the global meteorological system - perpetually
reinvent themselves as populated totally by innocents?]{.underline}**
One of the hypotheses of this paper is that perhaps it is **[in the
construction of the logic of warfare itself that such a double thinking
is possible.]{.underline}** And, is this double-thinking perhaps also
the site of an opportunity to imagine an alternative way of thinking the
outside of the social that contests the logic of war? Returning to
Bush\'s statement: the collapse of difference between policing and the
military implicitly erases the distinction that it simultaneously
reasserts by imagining an innocent civil society that is to be defended.
How does this complex logic work, and what politics can deal with it?
12. It may seem at first that Deleuze and Guattari\'s account of the
war-machine provides the insight we\'re seeking into the disjunctive
relationship between war and civil society. The State, in this account,
appropriates a nomad war-machine, exploiting it for strategic advantage,
while never fully domesticating it. The war-machine remains a threat to
the State that uses it, operating according to a completely separate,
even antipathetic ethic, and unleashing into the State a range of
practices and impulses that consistently undermine the stable operation
and ordering of political society. The problem with this account for our
purposes is that the war-machine, although it can inhabit civil society,
perhaps even invisibly, never loses its alienation from State-logic. Its
exteriority remains concealed and problematic. It troubles the State,
without necessarily revealing the latter\'s dynamics. In other words,
because it conceives of the war-machine as irreducibly external to the
State (\"a pure exteriority,\"9Deleuze and Guattari call it), this
argument does not help to reveal the obscure logic in which they are
imbricated, and in which they cannot operate or even arise separately
from one another. 13. The problem of exteriority and war is dealt with
by Bataille in The Accursed Share10, and it is here that we will begin
to trace another account of war. Bataille\'s discussion of the
relationship between war and the social emerges in his discussion of the
economy of production and consumption in human societies. What does
Bataille mean by consumption? [**To Bataille, [all purposeful human
behaviours]{.mark} - an agricultural system, a technological innovation,
a social identity - [are an]{.mark} albeit necessary [interruption in
the continuous flows of energy that are the foundation and material of
all things. In order to]{.mark} feed ourselves, and [organise]{.mark}
our societies, [we]{.mark} need to [exempt ourselves from the
universe\'s ongoing, and ultimately irresistible flows of unstructured
energy, out of which we]{.mark} and all we do [are made, and which drive
endlessly on to]{.mark} an [excess]{.mark} and exhaustion [that will
inevitably bring undone all the patterns we laboriously
contrive.]{.mark}** **[We draw on these]{.mark} continuous
[flows]{.mark} of energy, [even as they undo what we
do.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Our doing and its undoing are part of the one
double, self-contradictory process. From within the artificial world of
meaningful and purposeful action, we simultaneously, on the one hand,
repudiate and defy the flows of continuity that underlie our forms, and,
on the other hand, we also recognize and draw ourselves towards them.
This recognition is enacted both incidentally and elaborately, through
our practices of death and sexuality in particular, and the public
festivals that dramatise them. 14. An example Bataille gives of this is
Aztec human sacrifice. The Aztecs, according to Bataille, captured and
then feted a particular human individual, on whom they lavished the
greatest wealth and luxury, art and adornment. At the end of a specified
period of time, this individual would be brutally and ostentatiously
slaughtered. The aim of this festival was to open a channel through the
otherwise sealed world of logical order, and allow humans to connect
with the flows of continuity that represented the truth of being, and
from which in daily life, people needed to struggle to exempt
themselves. This process was what Bataille understood as transgression.
Because they involved a wilful destruction of all that had been
painstakingly accrued through disciplined practices of husbandry and
production, Bataille named these transgressive practices
\"consumption.\" War is one of these transgressive rituals. Rather than
seeing war as an emotional explosion of primitivism, or the result of
calculating strategy, Bataille saw war as one of the processes whereby
human societies broke out of the constraint of purpose and order to
encounter the truth they could not always live. 15. Several things need
to be said about this process. Firstly, to summarise the complex logic
here. Transgression expresses a society\'s engagement with the
irrational and excessive flows of energy that have made all its systems
and logics possible, but which also exceed and threaten them. Engagement
with these flows is a fulfilment of our nature, but it must be felt as a
contradiction of our normal, rational, life, that it simultaneously
confirms. War opens up possibilities of ecstasy, intensity and violence,
while retrospectively constructing before and to endure beside and
beyond them, an imagined culture of reason, innocence and meaning.
Dissociation and excess require this zone as the antecedent of
transgression, in fact, what is to be transgressed. Reason, morality and
purpose then are constructed as the necessary counterpart and context of
excessive violence and disarray. Following this logic, war then cannot
be simply something executed by \"the social\" nor can it be a simple
version of it. It defines the social as the locus of an innocence that
violence is to transgress, a rightness that needs to be defied by a
brutality that confirms and consolidates it. Innocence thus needs war as
that which both confirms and justifies it as innocence. 16. Secondly,
[this process of transgression requires a re-thinking of
subjectivity]{.underline}. **[The [subjectivity of normal social life is
an artificial construct made available by]{.mark} the [flows of
energy]{.mark}, but perched precariously upon them. Such [specific,
individual]{.mark} or localised [subjectivities are mere
fictions]{.mark}, chimera.]{.underline}** Bataille wasn\'t afraid to say
that the truth of subjectivity was available, but only through the
process of transgression, the drive to radical exteriority. [**[Only the
subject that could instantiate the flows of the cosmic energy field was
authentic]{.mark}** to Bataille, and humans recognized and tried to live
this subjectivity]{.underline}. [The figure that incarnated or
represented this asymptotic subject, Bataille called the
sovereign]{.underline}. **[The sovereign embodied a subjectivity that
lived [the intense basic truth of cosmic force]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Individual]{.mark} [identity was only ever a pathetic degradation of
this heroic possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The subject of war,
then, is radical exteriority imagined as livable, and is in defiance of
any of the constraints and order that define conventional subjectivity.
This sovereignty is both the same as and different to the one Agamben
derives from Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. It is a logic of exception from
historical accountability. However, in Bataille crucially, it is less a
hardened singular authority than a dream of the instantiation of radical
chaos, one that subjectivity aims to emulate in its truth. As Derrida
argues in \"Force of Law\"12and most recently in Rogues, this
sovereignty must be seen in its dangerous doubleness, as both the risk
of the worst and the only promise of justice. 17. Thirdly, Bataille
thought that rituals of sacrifice proposed a question. Rituals
dramatised the human need to make contact with the forces of the cosmos,
but why did they have to take this form: the slaughter of a human being?
What was specific about this process that made it sensible as an
engagement with cosmic truth? Sacrifice, he postulated, annihilated its
object. It took something we might recognize as a version of ourselves,
another human subject more or less equivalent to us, and it turned this
subject into an object and then destroyed it. Bataille argued that this
process of annihilation of the object defined what consumption was all
about. It was simply the human act of denial of our own objectivity. By
thoroughly destroying the object, human beings separated themselves from
the possibility of considering themselves to be objects, and thus showed
that they could not be reduced to the level of the merely calculable
that defined the rational practices of daily life. The human approach to
objects in general involves, firstly, this insistence on their reduction
to pure objectivity, and secondly, on their being used up, being
annihilated as a display of control over and contempt for the objects
that we believe we are showing are ontologically different from
ourselves. War then, turns what is not an object into an object, and
then annihilates it in order to show that we are not like it. It does
this by first annihilating any impression or trace of alternative
subjectivity in the object, and then consuming it as an object, by
physically destroying it in order to show the triumph of its own claim
to not only exclusive subjectivity, but a subjectivity projected
backwards to us from the radical exteriority in which our truth resides.
18. It would be possible to use this insight to speculate in
subjective-cultural terms on the US government\'s response to [the
terrorist attacks of September 11]{.underline}. **[[Horrified at being
objectified, being turned into a passive target by Al-Qaida, the US
mounted a massive attempt to reclaim the prerogatives of subjectivity.
It needed to turn itself from object to subject, by insisting on the
objectivity of others]{.mark}, at first [in Afghanistan and then
Iraq.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[These others must have their subjectivity
minimised]{.mark} - by in the case of Iraq[, the ontology of the
nation]{.mark} being [reduced from millions]{.mark} of people [to one
demonised]{.mark} [name]{.mark} (\"Saddam Hussein\"), [by the obscuring
of the casualty rates of the Iraqi people]{.mark}, and by **[having
their political aspirations reduced to being identical with]{.mark}**
the middle of any [Western democracy.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[This
objectification of subjectivity licenses violence and restores
subjectivity to the US. More than vengeance,]{.mark} more than [strategy
or oil,]{.mark} the original political popula[rity of the Iraq venture
could be seen as an attempt to reclaim a subjectivity lost by the
mystery, the abject confusion of having been
objectified]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 19. In sum, then, **[[war allows us
access to a triumphal and exterior subjectivity we feel is our truth, by
annihilating the other first as subject and then as
object]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Although this project fulfils us, we
always represent and understand it as]{.underline}]{.mark} a
transgression[[, a contradiction of our normal rational
innocence.]{.underline}]{.mark} This latter point helps us to a
provisional answer to one of the questions we have been pursuing: [how
[a war-like culture with a history of]{.mark} relentless [conquest and
genocide is able to believe itself so peace-loving and innocent]{.mark}.
The logic of war is understood as an adventure beyond innocence and
reason and its conventional liberal interiorities out into an
exteriority that provides a subjectivity beyond constraint]{.underline}.
**[[An innocent domain]{.mark} then [is perpetually retrospectively
reinvented by the wars it requires as the thing that war leaves
behind.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Similarly, defining a social rift, or
even a policy, as a war - war on crime, war on drugs, a culture war -
retrospectively identifies the social as a transgressed innocence, a
site of authentic self-identity and normality threatened by the poor,
drugs, liberal dissent, and so on. 20. According to Bataille\'s double
logic, then, [war unfolds as a transgression of radical innocence and of
reason. [Innocence and war would be part of one complex, necessary to
one another, but]{.mark} they would be understood to be and
[represented]{.mark} [as]{.mark} fundamentally separate, and [notionally
opposite to one another]{.mark}]{.underline}. How does this complex
relationship play itself out? Beside its transgressive nature, [we have
identified two other things about war: the radical exteriority of its
understanding of subjectivity and its will to annihilation of its
object.]{.underline} It achieves this [by]{.underline} first [erasing
any trace of subjectivity in the object, and then destroying it as
object. **[The aim]{.mark}**]{.underline} here, according to Bataille\'s
theory of consumption, [[is to arrogate subjectivity to oneself, by
rendering any notion of the subjectivity and consequently the being of
the other impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[One\'s own subjectivity
emerges only as an uber-subjectivity, as the supersession of
subjectivity in an act of destruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
destruction of the subjectivity of the war-object also then involves the
destruction or at least the surpassing of the warrior\'s own
subjectivity. In destroying the subjectivity of the other, it imagines
itself out in the stream of larger entropic energy that Bataille saw as
the meaning of the cosmos. The logic of the annihilation of the other
and the exteriority of subjectivity are the same logic therefore. 21.
[The war/society complex can be seen then as the exteriorization of the
subject by pursuing the will-to-annihilation of the object.]{.underline}
[This defines the war/society in its radical disloyalty to
itself.]{.underline} **[[The war/society produces this logic in both its
peaceful and aggressive phases: in military force]{.mark}, police
tactic, [media]{.mark} campaign or [social policy]{.mark}, but also
[in]{.mark} its [economics]{.mark}, its consumption [and]{.mark} its
[consumerism]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[yet the war/society is able to
insist on the radical disjunction between its different
phases]{.underline}]{.mark}, a disjunction it cannot even really produce
let alone stabilize. (Where exactly would the dividing line fall?)
**[[This]{.mark} common ground]{.underline}**, even when disguised by a
refuge in the logic of transgression, **[[indicates the dominant mode of
the globalizing West,]{.mark} on its mission [as the ultra-violent
bestower,]{.mark} even incarnation, [of peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
22. [By [constructing its own subjectivity as the supersession of
subjectivity through the annihilation of all alternative
subjectivities]{.mark}, the subjectivity of the war/society is at work
in war, but not at stake**.**]{.underline} **[Not only does war provide
an image of innocence by representing its violent self as other to
society,]{.underline}** but the exteriorising subject never has content
enough to be in any way answerable. **[Because its logic requires the
annihilation of its object, it can refuse to acknowledge the position
from which it could be interrogated or accused.]{.underline}** [Hence
the refusal of the United States to imagine being answerable to the
International Criminal Court.]{.underline} **[[The war/society is
protected from accusation, until it is defeated, and becomes an object
again]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The west will not suffer interrogation
of its innocence while it remains triumphant]{.underline}]{.mark}. What
this means is that **[[the war/society will not amend itself, will not
become responsible or fair or self-reflexive as long as it continues to
believe that its historic mission has been a
success.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[This cannot be summarily dismissed as
a commitment to the doctrine of \"might is right,\"]{.underline}**
though the continuity between the ancient faith in providence\'s
manifestation of its truth through trial-by-violence and contemporary
belief in military victory as implicit vindication would repay
investigation. What we can say with some certainty is that **[[what has
been unwittingly chosen is a radical commitment to defeat as the only
impetus towards self-knowledge.]{.mark} Thus, [as we have seen
with]{.mark} the [Vietnam War, only the indefinite postponement
of]{.mark} the acknowledgement of [defeat can allow faith in war to
endure]{.mark}. However, [what is at stake is]{.mark} not mere
self-delusion, but [the logic by which war can emerge in the unfolding
of a social project that can maintain its self-image of peace and
innocence]{.mark}. This is [not]{.mark} done by [willing blindness, but
because war is available only by way of a complex that installs
innocence]{.mark} within, and even as, it.]{.underline}** 23. Derrida\'s
reading of Levinas in terms of hospitality in Adieu: To Emmanuel Levinas
also leads to a discussion of the relationship between peace and war. In
discussing Levinas\'s critique of the reductive logic of thematisation,
Derrida writes: Thematisation . . . always presupposes hospitality,
welcoming, intentionality, the face. The closing of the door,
inhospitality, war, and allergy already imply, as their possibility, a
hospitality offered or received: an original or, more precisely,
pre-originary declaration of peace.13 24. According to Derrida, Levinas
sees war as an intervention into a space always already opened by peace.
This directly contests the Hobbesian idea of peace as a political
institution uneasily regulating a universal will to violence that
defines humanity in its natural state, and to which we are constantly
tempted to return. Levinas stands in contrast to the analogous idea in
Kant: Instituted as peace, universal hospitality must, according to
Kant, put an end to natural hostility. For Levinas, on the contrary,
allergy, the refusal or forgetting of the face, comes to inscribe its
secondary negativity against a backdrop of peace, against the backdrop
of a hospitality that does not belong to the order of the political, or
at least not simply to a political space.14 25. Peace opens before the
construction of a political, or even a social domain, or, to be more
accurate, is always already in place when those domains are instituted.
War, thus, is not a natural state that needs to be regulated by a
political legality that is the unnatural and only way of saving us from
ourselves. War interrupts, overclouds and contests a peace that exists
before politics and legality themselves. 26. Later, when contemplating
the meaning of peace, Derrida unsettles the relationship between war and
peace. \"This opposition cannot be simply assumed,\"15he writes. The
symmetry between war and peace is \"broken\" by the ascription to one of
(pre-)originary status.16In Levinas\'s case, this asymmetry takes the
form of the absolute irrepressibility of peace, even in war. \"War
itself retains the testimonial trace of a pacific welcoming of the
face.\"17Such a logic seems to reduce war by making it junior to the
peace it sunders or supplants. But Derrida is aware of the problem here.
\"That war still bears witness to peace, that it remains a phenomenon of
peace is not, as we know, one of the consequences drawn by Levinas, but
the risk remains.\"18The risk would be that war would be an act of
hospitality despite itself, and would then be residually ethical. It
would mark out and advance what it also disputes. 27. We have seen how
in Bataille\'s economics, **[innocence is necessarily reconstituted as
that which war needs in order to have something to
transgress]{.underline}**. [[War confirms innocence as that which seems
to anticipate it and that it defies.]{.mark}]{.underline} We argued that
**[[this is what allows war-like powers to endlessly re-imagine the
innocence of their citizenry]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It follows that
**[the constant recourse of societies to seeing their internal rivalries
and even social policies as war is arguably a version of the same thing:
[war is declared in order to confirm that there is necessarily a social
domain full of grace that needs to be protected]{.mark} - in fact
invented - through war]{.underline}**. [To see society as warfare is
always to imagine the barricade, the sub-culture, the hearth within
which something or other is sheltering, something that the enemy,
imagined as violence-incarnated, threatens to destroy]{.underline}. Is
what we see here in Derrida\'s reading of Levinas a version of the same
thing, where [[war endlessly confirms the peace it would seem to]{.mark}
[defy]{.mark}?]{.underline} 28. To understand Derrida\'s argument here
it is important to revisit an important pattern of thought that emerges
in late Derrida. Here, there is repeatedly advanced a logic of the
relationship between calculability and incalculability that Derrida
himself insists is the key to understanding the long history of
deconstruction. This logic is summarised in the final section of Rogues:
Two Essays on Reason. Derrida attempts to draw a parallel between
several complexes that he has been discussing for a number of years: law
and justice, the absolute law and the conventional laws of hospitality,
the gift and the economy and so on. Each of these pairs involves the
inextricable relationship between the unconditional and incalculable, on
the one hand, and the conditional and calculable, on the other. For
example, as Derrida argued in \"Force of Law,\" the operation of law as
a human institution capable of enacting and enforcing judgements is
impossible without reference to a larger and irreducibly open idea of
justice. Law would make no sense if it could not presume the larger,
excessive and anterior opening of a justice that it is constitutionally
incapable of fully enacting. Justice is always in excess of law, drawing
it out and on, while always defying its resort to stability and
identity. The relationship, however, is not simply unidirectional: in
the same way that law requires an unquantifiable justice to explain and
orient it, justice can only appear in and as the laws it exceeds.
Justice has no ontology other than through law. Justice needs law as
much as law needs justice. 29. To take just one more example, the same
logic emerges in the complexes that define the relationship between the
absolute law of hospitality, according to which anybody must be welcomed
without condition, and the conventional laws of hospitality, which
define strict and discriminatory protocols of welcoming in specific
times and places. If there was no absolute of hospitality to which all
historicised acts of welcome refer, then the concept and practice of
hospitality, even in its most stringent form would lose all meaning.
Yet, on the other hand, absolute hospitality is in itself unrealisable.
30. Derrida summarises these complexes in terms of the relationship
between the incalculable and unconditional, on the one hand, and the
calculable and conditional, on the other, in a discussion of the same
logic as it emerges through a radically complicated contemplation of the
plurality of reason: According to a transaction that is each time novel,
each time without precedent, reason goes through and goes between, on
the one side, the reasoned exigency of calculation or conditionality
and, on the other, the intransigent, nonnegotiable exigency of
unconditional incalculability. This intractable exigency wins out . . .
and must win out over everything. On both sides, then, whether it is a
question of singularity or universality, and each time both at once,
both calculation and the incalculable are necessary.19 31. The
unconditional and incalculable then always exceed and threaten the
calculation and conditionality through which they are instantiated, even
as they make them possible. The conditioned emerges as a denomination of
that which itself does not emerge, and that is in itself impossible.
This impossible both allows the conditioned to take place and guarantees
that it will in time be vulnerable to transformation into something else
altogether. It is, thus, that within the conditioned that is beyond it,
and that ensures that its emergence occurs only as part of an ongoing
and open cycle of transformations. In this way, the conditioned cannot
emerge without the unconditioned. Both, as Derrida writes, are
necessary. 32. In Derrida\'s reading of Levinas, war bears with it the
trace of a peace that always precedes it. War is only made possible by
the opening of the face that guarantees human sociality as always
arising within a domain whose very opening, even prior to the
institution of anything legal or political - in other words, in its very
pre-originarity - is irreducibly ethical. What makes war possible is
peace. The problem that arises here is that war then becomes a
denomination of the ethical, albeit indirectly and despite itself, but
ethical nevertheless. 33. The commonality between this argument and
Bataille is clear. Both thinkers argue for a **[war]{.underline}** that
**[reconfirms peace as prior to it, and that is thus a necessary part of
its logic.]{.underline}** In Bataille, the presentation of the operation
of war as an opening of and onto the general economy connects the
loosening of identities with danger, destruction and violence. In
Derrida, this idea recurs in the proposition that deconstruction is
necessary and ineluctable but also always threatening and dangerous. The
relationship between pre-originary peace and the war that bears a trace
of it is in parallel with the relationship between the unconditional
incalculable and the conditional calculable. Incalculability and its
avatars seem to announce a pre-openness that allows for the loosening of
strictures and our exposure to the optimistic unsettling of any
deconstruction. Yet, Derrida acknowledges that the opening on the
unconditional can be dangerous. In a discussion of perhaps
deconstructive open-ness\'s most compelling figure, the messianic, he
writes: The coming of the other can only emerge as a singular event when
no anticipation sees it coming, when the other and death - and radical
evil - can come as a surprise at any moment. . . The messianic exposes
itself to absolute surprise and, even if it always takes the phenomenal
form of peace or of justice, it ought, exposing itself so abstractly, be
prepared (waiting without awaiting itself) for the best as for the
worst, the one never coming without opening the possibility of the
other.20 34. The same phrasing and idea have appeared elsewhere. An
unconditional justice \"is always very close to the bad, even to the
worst.\"21In the figure of Lot, an unconditional hospitality is staged
by way of the patriarch\'s preparedness to offer his daughters up to be
raped.22The open \"divine violence\" which allows for the possibility of
justice involves killing. Analogically, in Bataille, the inevitable
open-ness to consumption and excess may be part of war. The
unconditional incalculable then also involves the risk of danger, even
when it is called peace, and the danger in peace may indeed be war, and
vice versa. The language Derrida uses to describe the mirror-image of
the Levinasian position in Kant captures the complexity here, when he
detects in the promise \"the trace of a threat, of what threatens it and
threatens in it, thus contaminating the promise by a threat.\"[23There
is thus no simple benign peace unaffected by the war that infiltrates it
and with which it might operate, even as it is wrecked by it and with
which it might even become confused. We cannot rely on the simple
opposition between war, on the one hand, and, on the other, peace and
all its relatives]{.underline}: innocence, sociality, meaning and so on.
Nor can we rely on its simple overcoming in identity**[. Peace induces a
war that murders it but in which in turn its trace is
preserved]{.underline}**. [Each threatens the other it allows, makes and
is determined to ruin.]{.underline} With the long war of terror and the
increasing militarization of the rhetoric of social policy, the
inextricable entanglement of war and peace in one another has
facilitated an opportunistic politics. This is the logic of Bush\'s
re-endorsement of the Patriot Act in terms of the correspondence between
war and policing. [The interpenetration of war and peace is exploited
while it is denied. [Peace is re-imagined while it is
erased]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There must be a peace to be defended, yet
there is no point where it can be isolated from the war fought on its
behal]{.mark}f]{.underline}. In The New Western Way of War, Martin Shaw
argues that contemporary war must be understood not in terms of the
technological developments that have fascinated generals and strategic
thinkers in the digital age, but in a \"broader social, political and
military context.\"[24War must be seen as a cultural practice that makes
certain strategic arrangements and political manipulations possible.
[War will always be available in the lineaments of peace, to be easily
evoked with an intimidating urgency as the latter\'s hidden
intensity.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Peace is not some benign social goal
to be purified and redeemed but may itself be either code for war, or
war\'s pretext]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This contradiction immerses us
not in an historical moment when the distinction between war and peace
needs to be rigidified, and then applied, by a radical commitment to
peace. Instead, the war/peace complex needs to be negotiated instance by
instance, with an awareness of its complex and fluid failure to become
either radically singular or clearly plural. 36. The failure to identify
an event or measure that would allow us to know when the indefinitely
open war on terror now being undertaken would be over, and peace
restored, is not, therefore, a sign that in this case, the term war has
been misapplied, but an insight into the contemporary nature of war.
Like the police-work with which George Bush connects it, **[[war is not
a spasmodic episode]{.mark} of rapid historical transition, [but
peace\'s permanent agony]{.mark}. Peace and war incite each other
continuously, while at the same time, each shapes to supersede the
other. [The war on terror is the explicit announcement of an enduring
peace-war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** End. 37. Yet, at the same time, these
complexities do not reduce the inevitable excess of excess. The
unconditional and incalculable cannot stop re-introducing into the
complexes that partake of them, the endlessly repeatable injunction to
change. In other words, [**[the excess of war cannot end merely in a
neat circularity and systematicity where violence and consumption merely
produce and validate order and production in a zero-sum
game]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The relationship here is never symmetrical.
Excess is always re-emerging, because in any logic open - and all logic
is open - to the unconditional, there is no end. War then does not only
partake of excess, but is itself to be exceeded. There is never not the
drive to do better than it. 38. We have proposed that war partakes of an
irreducible and contradictory complex of innocence and
[excess,]{.underline} or that [it always bears with it and reconfirms
the peace that it would seem to contradict. This]{.underline} logic
allo[ws us to think through the contradictory way in which war is
practised by the self-identified peaceful as peace]{.underline}. In so
doing [it goes beyond logics that try to insist on the difference
between war and the socialities that practice it]{.underline} - or that
fall, slip or leap into it; and it also goes beyond the
self-congratulatory rhetoric that simply collapses the difference
between them. In other words, it provides a way of talking about the
relationships in which war is embedded that acknowledges their
complexity, dynamism and obscurity. [War appears thus not as a simple
entity, but as a complex pattern of meaning-making, one entangled in
other social patterns that it both defies and confirms, and that in turn
rely on it while abominating it]{.underline}. And this characterisation
of it is still far too simple. **[[The casual, projective,]{.mark}
libidinal and fictional as well as the global, national and diplomatic
[constructions of]{.mark} both an unlimited just [war and an
irresistible perpetual peace should make us aware of]{.mark} the complex
and unstable [social, cultural and political economies that]{.mark}
continually and [radically complicate our ethics and subjectivities, by
instituting our innocence as a style of warfare, while animating a peace
that war bears witness to while it works to destroy
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, [[our moral discourses of war
and peace]{.mark}, in which we constantly insist on either an endless
preparedness for battle or the final death of war, or both, [need to be
seen as part of the complex logic in which war and peace entail one
another]{.mark}, while at the same time each opens on the
incalculability]{.underline} [that]{.underline} at least notionally and
temporarily [allows for them both to be completely undone. It is in the
complex ambiguity]{.underline} here from which we can never exempt
ourselves, [that war is fought]{.underline} and to be fought.

#### Withdrawal fails to transform warfare and obscures the economic, environmental, and diplomatic wars haunting our futures 

**Mansfield 07** (Critical Cultural Studies, Mark, MOSAIC Jun 2007)

It would be tempting-and seemingly appropriate-to apply a Levinasian
schema here. What would seem to be at stake is the determination on the
part of a putative subject to reduce the other to a level of shared
identity. You are my enemy because you could be my co-citizen, a
democrat, a Christian. But this politics is not to be subjec-tivized.
These markers of identity do not determine the politics here, as much as
they are merely its pretext, or point of articulation. Even in the
deconstruction of Schmitt, the idea of the impersonality of enmity
persists. What is at stake is not a determination to annihilate
otherness in order to consolidate a self-identical self. What is
revealed is **[the dynamic always latent within any definition of
friendship or enmity, and]{.underline}** thus of
**[politics,]{.underline}** the range of possible [**slippages,
confusions, and collapses of difference that history can always reveal,
events in which I can kill the person I came to protect, I can destroy
the village in order to save it, I can be kept free by having my rights
taken away from me, and where I can torture in the name of human
rights.**]{.underline} What the complexity of the friend/enemy economy
stages, therefore, is not a site of subjective truth but a specifically
Derridean type of historicity. Derrida discusses how Schmitt\'s
definition of the enemy relies on the \"real possibility of war\" with
them. **[[The real]{.mark} possibility of [war is]{.mark} less the
announcement of a real event]{.underline}** that might or might not
happen**[, as much as [a kind of negative messianism: the future event
to which we must orient ourselves in order to experience
meaning]{.mark}, but [whose power resides in the fact that it will not
come to pass]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This real possibility installs in
the heart of Schmitt\'s argument a kind of suspension that means that
the definitions that would seem to rely on this concept become
themselves irretrievably unfinished. **[[The distinction between friend
and enemy cannot]{.mark} finally [be realized]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
because this real possibility is fundamentally a spectrality. \"For what
is this \'real possibility\' haunting Schmitt if not the very law of
spectrality?\" Derrida writes (Politics 129). **[[Politics is haunted by
the real possibility of war.]{.mark} This takes the form of friendship
and enmity always lying in wait for one another, [threatening one
another with that which both ruins and defines]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Friendship can never not be haunted by the possibility of enmity. It
cannot be friendship without this possibility latent within it. I can
only be your friend because of the possible enmity that I can see within
you and that haunts our friendship, and that might at any sudden and
eruptive, but always just-with-held, still-future moment, become
you[.]{.underline} You are only my friend because you are always about
to be my enemy, so that I must be prepared to treat both aspects of you
always and at once. **[Even as I care for you and save you, you threaten
me, at least with the threat I must represent to you too, [the
possibility that we are always already enemies and that I will hurt you
even as I help you. The logic of spectrality can never be reduced to a
singularity that will save us from this risk]{.mark}. My concern for you
cannot be stopped once and forever from becoming my cruelty towards you.
We can fight wars for human rights but there will always be only the
thinness of a piece of paper between wars for human rights and wars on
human rights. And sometimes not even that]{.underline}**. The
deconstruction of the friend/enemy and the war/peace binaries do not
free us into a world unpolluted by the authoritarianism of
self-identity. The continued assumption that deconstruction is an avenue
to a kind of freedom-freedom from the current gender regime, from the
centripetal logic of colonialism, from the simplest of racial
hierarchies-does not help us here.**[[What the
deconstructions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that have been the focus of this
paper [**[do]{.underline}** **[is re-immerse us in the historical
complexities of our current political situation.
They]{.underline}**]{.mark} do not offer some beyond of war and peace,
for example, but **[reveal the [obscure entanglements too easily]{.mark}
and briskly concealed [by talk of \"war or peace,\" \"war instead of
peace,\" or \"peace instead of war]{.mark}.\" Promoters of war go to war
for putative friends-the whole undifferentiated category of \"the Iraqi
people,\" for example-who never quite fail to be read as a danger, and
thus can become the object of torture and massacre. They can be friends,
Derrida argues, only if they can also be enemies.]{.underline}** The
aporia at the heart of the friend/enemy distinction has historical
results. On the other hand, **[[to argue that peace can be historically
realized]{.underline}]{.mark}**-in other words, to argue that it can be
not just eschatological-**[[becomes merely a way of pretending that the
cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of troops]{.mark}, for example,
[can resolve complex]{.mark} economic, diplomatic, and strategic
[inter-relationships]{.mark}, thus [leading to a too-easy denial of the
many forms war can take. The simple withdrawal of Western troops from a
certain place does not mean that it is no longer caught up,]{.mark}
directly or indirectly[, in the economic, environmental, and diplomatic
war the West is always waging]{.mark} under other names[. Neither war
nor peace protects us from its other.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Impacts

### Necropolitics 

#### Now the impact is a necropolitical obsession with the avoidance of death through the transference of death onto others -- this creation of the spectacle is one that safeguards "us" from "them". Specifically, Mbembe says that that the banking model of education itself creates a war for "purity" for the biophilic obsession within the vital forces which ignores the ways in which the drive for life affirmation destroys the very possibility for life itself.

There is an [anxiety in Freirian scholarship that we will lose our
immanent and personable connections]{.underline} with "the master,"
Paulo Freire himself. Thus collections like Memories of Paulo (2010)
edited by Tom Wilson, Peter Park, and Anaida Colón-Muniz emphasize
personal stories/encounters with Freire. In his open letter to Freire at
the beginning of the book Pedagogy of Indignation, Balduino A. Andreola
states, "On September 19, 1998, during the popular closing celebration
for the First International Paulo Freire Colloquium, in Recife, Nita
mentioned that she just couldn't think of you as being absent \... you
remain our partner in the journey" (Freire 2004b, xxxv). Andreola
continues, granting Freire a type of "permanent- presence" (Freire
2004b, xxxv) [in the world that defies death---a message that his own
posthumous letter to Freire seems to embody]{.underline}. Such [work
attempts to close the gap between Freire as a historical person and
Freire as a discourse]{.underline}---his [discourse must be supplemented
by his permanent- presence]{.underline} as a historical person and
likewise his historical person must be continually invoked through his
discourse. As such, [there is a movement within Freirian scholarship
that fills space opened up by his death]{.underline} with a
proliferation of memories, whose accuracy is "guaranteed" because of
proximity to Freire "as he really was." [Inspiration here is dependent
on a certain avoidance of death in the form of memoirs as well as
continual invocations of his bodily presence in the form of photographs
on and within books by or about Freire.]{.underline} In other words,
memory returns Freire to life, creating a [continuity between his flesh
and his words, and in the process denying any absence instituted by and
through the event of death.]{.underline}

This [radical critique of death is not simply the result of the longing
induced by his passing]{.underline}. The [pedagogy of the oppressed is
itself an attempt to challenge death both physically]{.underline}
(overcoming the pain and su ering of oppression) [and also
ideologically]{.underline} in the form of consciousness-raising. In
Pedagogy of the Oppressed, [Freire observes that the pedagogy of
oppression is necrophylic]{.underline}. Rather than biophylic or in love
with life, [banking education promotes a fetishization of death in the
form of a nihilistic fatalism concerning social and individual
transformation]{.underline} (2001b, 77). [Banking education separates
bios from politics, from language and action in the public
sphere.]{.underline} For Freire the [result is an untimely death, a
passive existence in the order of things and a fatalistic outlook on
social transformation]{.underline}. In order to define the parameters of
necrophylic pedagogy [Freire contrasts his utopian vision with banking
education:]{.underline} "Revolutionary [utopia tends to be dynamic
rather than static; tends to life rather than death]{.underline}; to the
future as a challenge to man's creativity rather than as a repetition of
the present . . . to dialogue rather than mutism . . ." (1985a, 82).
[Death is here conceptualized as the negation of life in the form of
mutism]{.underline}, repetition, passivity. [Death is, in other words, a
silenced existence lacking in words and deeds wherein students see
themselves as passive rather than active agents in their
lives]{.underline}. Furthermore, [death is an "anesthesized
curiosity]{.underline}" (as discussed in Chapter Four) [stunting the
student's inquiry into the way the world works]{.underline}. In sum,
[necrophylia is the educational logic of the morbidity of life, draining
life of its creative potential.]{.underline} Freire argues that "In
addition to the life-death cycle basic to nature, there is almost an
unnatural living death: life that is denied its fullness" (2001b, 171).
The living death of banking [education is an existential death that
separates life from itself from within life]{.underline}---a [passive
life devoid of the meaning and personal biography that defines bios as
an active life]{.underline} in the polis. In short, for Freire, [banking
education is a form of pedagogy that ends up "terminating
life]{.underline}"(1996, 165) while problem-posing education is fueled
by a "love for life" (1996, 164). In fact, the [radical fight today
concerns the "biophilic" fight for "purity"]{.underline} (Freire 1997,
83). In this sense, [biophilia is the purification of life from the
contaminant of death]{.underline} that, for Freire, is always
characterized as mutism and the end of history/ historical becoming. The
[new love for life is expressed in Freire's theory by a revivification
of epistemological curiosity]{.underline} into the nature of reality
(see Chapter Three). If [banking education creates the fatalistic
condition in which life becomes a form of symbolic death
(]{.underline}wherein world and word are separated), then
[problem-posing revivifies life by reconnecting it with political
activity]{.underline} and the active construction of knowledge through
the proper naming of the world.

[Existential death is a form of dehumanization]{.underline} for Freire.
[Even if the question of life is distinct from the question of becoming
fully human, nevertheless Freire's characterization of death as a mute,
passive existence recalls his discussion of the state of animal
captivation]{.underline}. For Freire, [animal life dialectically reveals
its opposite: a living death]{.underline}. Animal [existence
is]{.underline} "plane, horizontal, and timeless" (Freire 1997, 32) [not
unlike the state of death itself]{.underline}. If, for Freire "the
[death of history]{.underline} \[and thus of our historicity\] \...
[negates human beings]{.underline}" (2007, viii) then in a sense,
[existential death deprives us of life by collapsing the human into the
mute existence of the animal]{.underline}. [To live in a world, that
world must be perceived as a process of being and becoming]{.underline},
which is only accessible by humans whose epistemological curiosity is
capable of self-re ection. [Lacking the ability to transform ingenious
curiosity into epistemological curiosity, the realm of animal life is
not a life at all, and human life is in the last instance the only life
that qualifies as such]{.underline}. This isomorphism between the animal
and death enables readers to con ate Freire's question of life with that
of human striving to overcome the limit of animality. [Human death as a
naïve consciousness and animal life as horizontal, static, and
unchanging merge in a zone of indistinction that allows the human to
pass into the animal and the animal into the human, thus creating a zone
of indiference upon which divisions must be drawn all the while
troubling this very division from the inside.]{.underline}

In a rather telling anecdote, Alma Flor Ada recalls a conversation with
Freire where he once said he enjoyed watching football because it was
"the only moment he could really just watch and not reflect about what
was going on" (Wilson, Park, Colón-Muñiz, 8). Freire then laughed and
stated "But, who wants to be dead, anyway?" Such an anecdote replays the
basic argument outlined above: a pure passi[ve existence devoid of
speech and thought is a form of living-death that must be avoided, even
if it offers a glimpse of a certain affective pleasure with the game
being watched. This affective attention to the game is not in itself a
form of life or a bios but rather a deadening or loss of self in the
moment of animal captivation. To view is to become-animal and thus
undergo a type of de-personalization and de-humanization akin to living
death. In this sense, living death is a jouissance or dirty pleasure
that exceeds the ontological vocation of humanization.]{.underline}

The [pedagogy of the oppressed is an attempt to reconnect words to
flesh]{.underline}, names to social relationships, [humanity to its
historicity]{.underline}---connec- tions that have been [severed by the
imposition of false images internalized as objective truths]{.underline}
and by ideologies of death. The [history that Freire wants to return the
oppressed to is their history of struggle against these images and thus
reconnect them to their ontological vocation as the motors of historical
transformation]{.underline}. In other words, [life is the romantic
celebration of immanence between word and flesh,]{.underline} where we
are at last able to name the word and the world in one complete moment
of liberation. In sum, [death must be conquered through an
epistemological curiosity and its attending utopian
imagination.]{.underline}

Super cially, it would seem that [Freire's theory corresponds with that
of Achille Mbembe]{.underline} (2003) who [argues that the current
regime is not biopolitical]{.underline}---as Hardt and Negri claim
(2000)--- [but rather necropo- litical. Obsessed with death, politics
now embodies a sovereign decision directly over and against life
itself]{.underline}. Freire's [banking education would thus be the
pedagogical logic of necropolitics, creating conditions where the only
outlet for resistance to educational interpellation is to "drop-out" of
school, resulting in a form of educational suicide]{.underline}. Rather
than biopolitical investment, [death has broken free from its
dialectical entanglements with life to become the overwhelming force of
capitalist appropriation itself.]{.underline} Yet [in his attempt to
separate life from death and thus necropolitics, Freire's logic cannot
escape the dialectic that reinscribes death into the heart of his
life-affirming pedagogy]{.underline}. The [ban on death is equivalent to
the death of death, revealing how biophilic pedagogy is itself obsessed
with]{.underline} death. Thus in his refusal to understand the
productive role of death within life, Freire's [immunizing logic creates
an autoimmune disease within the heart of the biophilic attempt to
transcend death]{.underline} (Esposito 2008). The [paradox also
re-enacts in a different valence]{.underline} the problems with Freire's
earlier [separation of sensation]{.underline} (here characterized as a
mute, passive, animal existence) [from intelligence]{.underline} (as a
dialogical, active, and human capacity for life). [We see Freire
cleaving sensation and intelligence]{.underline}, denying that sensation
itself is a [kind of somacognition or that seeing is a kind of embodied
thinking in its own right.]{.underline} Once arti cially separated and
divided, the [pedagogy of the oppressed must help the student awake from
the slumbering stupidity of the senses in order to conquer death and
live an active]{.underline}, intellectual life. Thus the [hierarchical
division outlined]{.underline} in Chapter Four is replayed here on the
existential level of the question of life against the domination of
death. [As before, the results of this distinction are
contradictory.]{.underline}

The full rami cations of the paradox of immunization become clear once
we recognize the active role that death plays in the poetics of
historical knowledge. When [Freire denies the role of death any emanci-
patory function in education,]{.underline} he [disconnects the
historical knowledge of oppression and struggle from what Rancière
refers to as the "poetics of knowledge]{.underline}" that exists in the
tenuous relation between literature-history- science in the modern era.
In The Names of History (1994), Rancière ghts against two tendencies
that have attempted to make history into a pure science. [Chronicles of
history foreclose on death through an emphasis on verifiable documents
as "tangible evidence"]{.underline} (as opposed to the spurious words of
the poor). Rancière summarizes: "Positivist history \[of the chroni-
clers\] refuses to confront the absence of its object, that 'hidden'
without which there is no science and that can't be reduced to the
archive buried in its files" (1994, 64). [Reformers]{.underline} on the
other hand [embrace death but only in the figure of ideological critique
and denunciation of mystification]{.underline} (for Freire this would
amount to critical consciousness raising). They fail to see how in
[their attempt to retrieve the silent witnesses of history, they demand
a certain infallible correlation between speech and place, cognition and
recognition that, like the chroniclers before them, ends up effacing the
possibility of historical events]{.underline}. In both cases, [death
becomes the heresy that these discourses do not permit]{.underline}.
Heresy is "life turned away from the word, turned away by the word"
(Rancière 1994, 73) and thus a narrative predi- cated on the
non-correspondence of flesh and word, on the glance of the actor on
stage rather than the retrospective and belated gaze of the expert. Yet,
as Rancière argues, "[The difference proper to history is death; it is
the power of death that attaches itself solely to the properties of the
speaker, it is the disturbance that this power introduces into all
positive knowledge.]{.underline} The [historian can't stop effacing the
line of death, but also can't stop tracing it anew]{.underline}. History
has its own life in this alternative throbbing of death and knowledge.
[It is the science that becomes singular only by playing on its own
condition of impossibility, but ceaselessly transforming it into a
condition of possibility, but also by marking anew, as furtively, as
discreetly as can be, the line of the impossible"]{.underline} (1994,
74--5). The [line "of meaning and death]{.underline}" is precisely the
line of "historiality and literariness, without which there would be no
place to write history" (Rancière 1994, 76). In other words, [death is
the sublime beauty at the heart of historical science that is both the
motor for knowledge and its stumbling block, the pensive detail that
shapes the literary dimension of the aesthetics of
knowledge]{.underline}. It is the detail that escapes memory and thus
all sense of self- possession and self-recognition. If Freire's
[pedagogy of the oppressed is an attempt to create a beautiful, "pure"
community of solidarity built out of shared class interests]{.underline}
(a reformist approach [to history wherein word and flesh, consciousness
and class position are once again reunited]{.underline} so as to speak
the truth of oppression sanctioned by the critical sociologist, philos-
opher, or critical pedagogue), then [death is the ghost in the machine
that prevents full presence while also generating the need for new
translations and performances.]{.underline}

### [Mastery]{.underline} 

#### The specter haunting education is the desire for complete and utter control. Modern day education focues on the desire to control and the will to mastery -- this manifests itself in education through processes of disciplinary control over bodies to foster obedianece -- a process which leads to the destruction of all being when we are placed as parts in the western machine of domination

**Allen'16 --** Ansgar Allen is lecturer in education at the University
of Sheffield, "Education, Mastery and the Marquis de Sade" \--

[Mastery has us by the throat]{.underline}. Unable to bring things up,
[prevented from taking things down---if we swallow, we do so without
conviction. Mastery catches and keeps us mid-gasp.]{.underline}

In [pursuit of mastery, education fell before its promised
transcendence. Mastery claimed to elevate the educated philosopher above
the quotidian,]{.underline} even make the philosopher immune to the
world below and its persecutions. Yet [mastery was yoked to its
opposite:]{.underline} the enslavement of the philosopher to a
philosophical doctrine. [Mastery required discipline and
self-control]{.underline}. It [subordinated the self to a philosophical
doctrine, wagering the self to an ordinance that promised future
sovereignty but demanded present obedience.]{.underline}

Seeking spiritual direction, [early philosophers enslaved themselves to
their chosen philosophical school. Consultations were offered to
non-philosophers too, for a fee]{.underline}. Whether a school was
joined or merely visited, the [spiritual direction on offer was
intended, in its final effects, to allow each candidate to "take control
and become master of \[her\]himself.]{.underline}"i With Christianity
and its selective adoption of ancient philosophy, [self-mastery became
"an instrument of subordination" of more complete effect]{.underline}.ii
Its [voluntary dimension was reduced as spiritual training came to
occupy the whole life of the Christian subject.]{.underline} The
[purpose of Christian guidance was to develop a form of
introspection]{.underline} that would "[fix]{.underline} more firmly the
[relationship of subordination]{.underline}"; it would attach its
recipients to a regime of power that would take care of their entire
life in all its detail and for the rest of its duration.iii At the same
time, the [promise of transcendence became ever more spectral, dependent
ultimately on God's will, against which the strength of will exhibited
by the self- denying Christian was of secondary importance.]{.underline}
For at the gates of heaven, God decides. On earth, the early [Christian
monk is warned against practising any self- denying ordinance to
excess.]{.underline} We find Cassian recalling tales of monks casting
themselves down wells, fasting excessively, or crossing deserts without
food in an effort to demonstrate just how catastrophically they had
achieved self-mastery, purging themselves of natural inclinations and
desires.iv These were not acts of extreme piety; they were symptomatic
of pride. And pride is of the devil.

With extreme asceticism the old but sinuous [link connecting the promise
of mastery to the necessity of enslavement calcified, and then
broke]{.underline}. Early Christian ascetic practitioners, those Cassian
warned against, so perfected their self-denials that they became
increasingly indifferent to pain and discomfort, removing themselves
beyond the grasp of power. Through [enslavement they reached its
opposite denying themselves so completely that little remained for power
to attack. In this advanced form asceticism posed a challenge to
Christianity]{.underline}, delivering its practitioners beyond the
influence of its institutions and teachings. The most potent ascetics
effectively reversed the self-denials of monastic obedience,
transforming these denials into a form of "egoistic self-mastery" that
denied access to external power.v

[To secure their foothold monastic and ecclesiastical institutions had
to bring self-mastery back within their control. They would purge
themselves of all vagrant, self-sufficient, ascetic heresies, and bring
all miracles, marvels, punishments and self-flagellations back into the
orbit of their influence]{.underline}. Eventually self-mastery would
slip its "doctrinal moorings" and migrate to a secular context.vi
[Education remains in awe of mastery. It preaches denial, yokes its
members to the pursuit of mastery, but will not allow that mastery to
become realised as such. Mastery haunts education as its most enduring
spectral promise.]{.underline}

[Just what exactly education promises mastery of, changes: from ancient
self in pursuit of wisdom, to medieval body desiring knowledge of God,
to modern subject of autonomous reason, and finally, to the promise that
we might one day master our own performativities.]{.underline} By
definition [such mastery is rarely, if ever achieved. Our nihilism is
the product of this framework,]{.underline} this [belief that education
requires higher objectives,]{.underline} a belief so well entrenched
that as each [objective comes under attack another is substituted in its
place]{.underline}. When substitutes are left wanting, [we are launched
into overproduction]{.underline}. For we [scarcely know how to operate
let alone educate without the promise of mastery]{.underline}. Once
described as the "destiny of two millennia of Western history,"
[nihilism is our unavoidable affliction]{.underline}.vii Those educators
claiming to exist beyond its reach are in denial. [There is no quick and
easy escape. We are trapped in the digestive tract of Western history.
Attached to a promise that is never delivered, we are its
disappointments]{.underline}, you and I. We are [debased and we debase
ourselves, desiring mastery through our enslavement.]{.underline}

### Racism

#### Racism is rooted in necropolitics - The government identifies the "others" and displaces violence upon them through the mobilization of the war machine

**Mbembe, 03,** (Achill senior researcher at the Institute of Social and
Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, Necropolitics,
Pgs. 16-17, 2003)

[Having presented a reading of politics as the work of
death]{.underline}, [I turn now to sovereignty]{.underline}, [expressed
predominantly as the right to kill]{.underline}. [For the purpose of my
argument]{.underline}, [I relate Foucault's notion of biopower to two
other concepts]{.underline}: [the state of exception and the state of
siege]{.underline}.[16 I examine those trajectories by which the state
of exception and the relation of enmity have become the normative basis
of the right to kill]{.underline}. [In such instances]{.underline},
[power]{.underline} ([and not necessarily state power]{.underline})
[continuously refers and appeals to exception]{.underline}, emergency,
[and a fictionalized notion of the enemy]{.underline}. It also labors to
produce that same exception, emergency, [and fictionalized
enemy]{.underline}. [In other words]{.underline}, [the question
is]{.underline}: [What is the relationship between politics and death in
those systems that can function only in a state of emergency? In
Foucault's formulation of it]{.underline}, [biopower appears to function
through dividing people into those who must live and those who must
die]{.underline}. [Operating on the basis of a split between the living
and the dead]{.underline}, [such a power defines itself in relation to a
biological field]{.underline}---[which it takes control of and vests
itself in]{.underline}. [This control presupposes the distribution of
human species into groups]{.underline}, [the subdivision of the
population into subgroups]{.underline}, [and the establishment of a
biological caesura between the ones and the others]{.underline}. [This
is what Foucault labels with the]{.underline} ([at first sight
familiar]{.underline}) [term racism]{.underline}.17 That race ([or for
that matter racism]{.underline}) fi[gures so prominently in the calculus
of biopower is entirely justifiable]{.underline}. After all, [more so
than class-thinking]{.underline} ([the ideology that defines history as
an economic struggle of classes]{.underline}), [race has been the ever
present shadow in Western political thought and practice]{.underline},
[especially when it comes to imagining the inhumanity of]{.underline},
[or rule over]{.underline}, foreign peoples. [Referring to both this
ever-presence and the phantomlike world of race in general]{.underline},
[Arendt locates their roots in the shattering experience of otherness
and suggests that the politics of race is ultimately linked to the
politics of death]{.underline}.18 Indeed, [in Foucault's
terms]{.underline}, [racism is above all a technology aimed at
permitting the exercise of biopower]{.underline}, ["that old sovereign
right of death." 19 In the economy of biopower]{.underline}, [the
function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and to make
possible the murderous functions of the state]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline}, he says, ["the condition for the acceptability of
putting to death."20 Foucault states clearly that the sovereign right to
kill]{.underline} (droit de glaive) [and the mechanisms of biopower are
inscribed in the way all modern states function]{.underline};21 indeed,
[they can be seen as constitutive elements of state power in
modernity]{.underline}. According to Foucault, [the Nazi state was the
most complete example of a state exercising the right to
kill]{.underline}. This state, he claims, [made the
management]{.underline}, [protection]{.underline}, [and cultivation of
life coextensive with the sovereign right to kill]{.underline}. [By bio-
logical extrapolation on the theme of the political enemy]{.underline},
[in organizing the war against its adversaries and]{.underline}, [at the
same time]{.underline}, [exposing its own citizens to war]{.underline},
[the Nazi state is seen as having opened the way for a formidable
consolidation of the right to kill]{.underline}, [which culminated in
the project of the "final solution." In doing so]{.underline}, [it
became the archetype of a power formation that combined the
characteristics of the racist state]{.underline}, [the murderous
state]{.underline}, [and the suicidal state]{.underline}.

### VTL

#### The AFF's obsession with survival ensured through our productive work in debate negates the essence and possibility of life.

**Vaneigem '94** /Raoul, Leader of the Situationist International, [The
Movement of the Free Spirit]{.underline}, Trans. R. Cherry and I.
Patterson, Zone Books: New York, pg. 16-17/

Many observations that were considered ludicrous in 1967 have now become
commonplace. For it is obvious today that \"[surviving\" has so far
prevented us from \"living\"]{.underline}; that [man\'s insistence on
making himself useful in his work is actually of little use to him in
his own life, and even kills him]{.underline}. It is clear, too, that
[life usually ends precisely because it has never begun]{.underline}
(which most people realize only in their last moments); and that the
price of representation is paid for in terms of world-weariness and
self-contempt. These ideas are already so deeply entrenched that, in the
absence of any real lived experience to dispel them, they still nourish
not only nostalgic theorizing but even the most fashionably glib talk.
This vicious cycle continues out of an old inertia: [the need to work in
order to survive compensates for the life lost in wage labor (an even
costlier form of survival]{.underline}). [The effect on consciousness is
fata]{.underline}l, with two sets of prejudices [contributing to the
mortification]{.underline}: in the first, [survival takes precedence
over living; and]{.underline} in the second, [the exercise of the
intellect -- through critical analysis of society, of political issues,
of cultural decay, of the future of humanity -- takes the place of
existence, while the body is left to express its discontent through
sickness and malaise]{.underline}. And one need not get very close to
these ideas to detect a whiff of the cassock. 3 [The economy is
everywhere that life is not: but however intertwined the two may become,
they simply do not meld, and one can never be confused with the other.
Most people do not really live: their overly precise calculations about
money, work, exchange, guilt and power govern their lives so thoroughly
and irremediably that the only thing to escape this bloodlessly cold
calculus is the warm pathos of sweat and tears -- which is all that is
left to take on the aspects of human reality]{.underline}.

#### Survival has become the hymn of capitalist enslavement after the death of god. The drive to survive, guided by our belief in the capitalist god rationality, is emptying humanity of its life force through libidinal alienation.

**Vaneigem 1994**

/Raoul, Leader of the Situationist International, [The Movement of the
Free Spirit]{.underline}, Trans. R. Cherry and I. Patterson, Zone Books:
New York, pg. 23-25/

But [this version of nature separated the world from life and reduced
the world to the market system]{.underline} . [With God thus brought
into conformity with nature, he was sold off at a discount to a
religion]{.underline} that was now just one ideology among others; and
so he became the last shoddy remnant of the heavenly order under which
had first emerged [the system of survival that humanity imposed on
itself at some specific point in its development]{.underline}. [God is
dead as a sovereign entity, as master of the world, but he lives on in
the religious form that gave birth to him by submitting mankind to
economic alienation: thought separated from life; or the body weakened
or broken in the name of labor]{.underline}. As he analyzed the
reproduction and self-destruction of commodities Marx never asked
himself how far his personal behavior obeyed economic reflexes. His
critique is the product of an intellectualism that reproduces the power
of the mind over the body; it is the work of a lasting influence of God
on the material world. However liberating its intentions it can only
effect changes in a world where [commodities are everywhere and humanity
is nowhere; it is a world where abstraction, being the ultimate and
initial form of the divine, empties individuals of their vital
substance, before crushing them under the weight of forces they are too
weak to withstand.]{.underline} The hordes of bureaucrats, now in their
twilight, wrestle to save an economy that can do no more than reinvest
its successive failures into even greater losses, proving that the age
of sacrifice is at an end. [But the form that binds individuals to a
society hostile to life can be broken only by the emancipation of
life]{.underline} . 9 [While constantly changing, man\'s exploitation of
man has remained essentially the same. Economic necessity, which
directly exiles us from life, perpetuates the decree of the gods who
expelled our ancestors from the domain of pleasure]{.underline}.
Immutable frontiers delimit the closed universe of exchange in which the
commodity evolves. Form, whose contours always shape a supposedly unique
reality, was depicted as a divine sphere even before it took on the
simultaneously concrete and abstract character of a bureaucratic
organization, turning on its own axis, and drawing everyone into its
gravitational field. [The heavenly economy has given way to the earthly
one, economic thought to economic materiality, spiritual alienation to
bodily alienation, collective sacrifice to individual
sacrifice]{.underline}. The separations remain as sharp as they have
always been, but today the wound is plain to see. [Just as bath water
spirals faster and faster as the last of it is drawn down the drain, the
whirlpool of life empties at its fastest as the economy uses up the
final resources of libidinal energy.]{.underline} [The only ones not to
hear its final gurglings are the statisticians and computer scientists
who hear only the din of their own calculating. Although all
commodity-based civilizations, without exception, have placed a
prohibition on pleasure and sexual enjoyment, the most urgent appeals of
profitability now invite us to plunge into hedonism, to consume pleasure
piecemeal and pay for it in installments. The last unopened market
verges on the free play of desire. So the last die is about to be cast
on the same table where the first was thrown, so long ago, under the eye
of the gods.]{.underline}

#### We must give up on our obsession with survival to release life from the suffocating security paradigm that consigns existence to the prison of work and paranoia. In order to reclaim the value to our lives, we must meet the political demands and blackmail of war presented by the AFF with the ecstatic joyful laughter of inner experience.

**Vaneigem '94** /Raoul, Leader of the Situationist International, [The
Movement of the Free Spirit]{.underline}, Trans. R. Cherry and I.
Patterson, Zone Books: New York, pg. 246-249/

Right now, [I can think of nothing as important, yet]{.underline}, at
the same time, [more unimportant, than survival]{.underline}. [I hope it
ceases to be a priority, as if surviving were necessary first in order
to live later]{.underline}. [(Experience has shown]{.underline},
however, [that allegiance to survival kills life as surely as work
destroys creativity.) The point is not to neglect survival entirely --
how could we - but to reverse the perspective so that survival becomes a
consequence of the will to live rather than the condition for
it.]{.underline} The way in which health issues are being approached now
suggests a certain awareness of the claims of living. For a long time
illness and the fear it inspired governed health. In the struggle
against the torments that endlessly assailed it health was a matter for
witch doctors, healers and physicians. Every illness set off a system of
panic and alarm that men of science encouraged whenever they intervened
to allay its effects. But now it is obvious to most people that the
doctor\'s curative power and his arsenal of chemicals are often
ineffective, even harmful, if patients are not energetically committed
to wanting to live, motivated not by a refusal to suffer but by a will
to enjoy themselves to the fullest. [The idea of vitality also makes no
sense if the fears accompanying the preoccupations of
survival]{.underline} - finding enough money or credit to get food,
clothing and a place to live - [do not give way to a dialectic of life,
to the demands of desires rooted in the heart, to an existence that
reveals its uniqueness]{.underline}. [This uniqueness lies in the
exuberance in which positive and negative, pleasure and displeasure,
harmony and discord throb with the rhythm of life until]{.underline},
out of breath, [they run their course. But it is an end that has nothing
in common with]{.underline} the death that governs [the society of
survival, whose withered state is the distinct sign of both beings and
things]{.underline}. Everyone, without exception, is an alchemist,
distilling his own substance at every moment. But [the magnum opus is
inverted and corrupted: the best becomes the worst, creativity becomes
work, the richness of being dwindles into possession, authenticity turns
into appearance, agony begins at birth]{.underline}. The millenarian
incitement to produce one\'s own [unhappiness has so thoroughly
impregnated the world of the imagination that everything]{.underline}
from art to daydreaming [consists of negative scenarios]{.underline},
doomed love affairs, inevitable failures, inevitable obsolescence,
bitter victories or bliss in ignorance. [The only way to remedy the
lassitude brought on by survival is through a treatment, focusing on
negativity, that uses alchemy to rid life of the effects of survival,
radically remaking the human from what is most human]{.underline}:
namely the search for pleasure. [The construction of a nature
emancipated from the mechanisms by which it is denatured can be seen in
the laughter]{.underline} and amused incomprehension with
[which]{.underline} the younger generations [greet the political
masquerade, the blackmail of war and insecurity, the manifestations of
authority, racist and sexist attitudes, expressions of contempt, and the
inflexibility imposed by the worship of the militarized commodity
market, the foundation of our wonderful civilization]{.underline}. As
for squandering one\'s last energies in an attempt to reintegrate
oneself into the misery of work, or walking willingly into the trap of a
computerized social world, these choices must be left to those
irretrievably conditioned to poverty. For the rest of us, [a good
watchword would be: \"The minimum of survival in the service of a
maximum of life."]{.underline} [The unavoidability of
negotiating]{.underline} the meshes of [the commodity
syste]{.underline}m - the necessity of obtaining a modicum of money -
[should only encourage us to exploit to the hilt whatever facilities
offer themselves that can help us get the time to pursue the pleasure of
belonging to ourselves and the pleasure of creating. While it may be
temporary, a solution that allows salaried workers to take more leaves
of absence]{.underline}, or that lets [unemployment money go toward
keeping a garden]{.underline}, seems [a better use of the national debt
than investing in a sluggish economy]{.underline} or subsidizing a
school for criminals by allocating funds to an army that seems more
useless and absurd than ever. [If life was able to resist the oppression
of a sovereign economy, it can surely triumph]{.underline}, today, [over
an economy that is falling into ruin]{.underline}. And if the need to
survive threatens modern cities with something as ancient as famine, why
shouldn\'t the revulsion provoked by a system of profitoriented
inhumanity encourage the foundation of its absolute opposite: [immediate
enjoyment with nothing expected in return]{.underline}? Abandoned
factories will one day be transformed into creative workshops [capable
of supplying life\'s desires]{.underline} with whatever material
support - no matter how luxurious - they might require.

### Art

#### Our affirmation of generative politics of nonknowledge stems from Van Gogh's work which helps to traverse the walls between knowledge and nonknowledge, between real and the fake. This corporeal rip and blurring of lines within the educational systems dichotomies creates affective resistance and changes the very modes of rationality and what it means to be "sane". Artaud says that this process is one that creates material shifts in the bodily manifestations of violence.

**Murray'14** Ros Murray -- Leverhulm Research Fellow @ Queen Mary --
PhD on Artaud "Antonin Artaud -- The Scum of the Soul" pg 125-127 2014
\-- KZaidi

[To return to Artaud's frequent references to agricultural activities
such as ploughing, hoeing, reaping or sowing to describe how he engages
with the surface of the page, these find their inspiration in the work
of Van Gogh.]{.underline} Artaud's 1947 publication Van Gogh le suicidé
de la société ([Van Gogh, the Man Suicided by Society]{.underline}) was
an enraged [response to an article]{.underline} written by a
psychiatrist, Dr Beer, published in the weekly journal Arts, in which
Beer describes Van Gogh's work as the work of someone who is mentally
ill. [Artaud produced this furious, beautifully written homage to Van
Gogh's work, which reads as much a response to his own pathologisation
as to that of Van Gogh. This text represents one of Artaud's most
vehement and successful protests against not only psy- chiatry itself,
but also any potential psychoanalytic readings of his own texts, seeming
once again to anticipate and undermine such an obvious critical
response.]{.underline}

[Artaud identifies a sense of brooding apocalypse in Van Gogh's
paintings]{.underline}, writing of the way [they portray]{.underline} a
'sensation d'occulte étranglée' ('[sensation of strangled
occult']{.underline}).19 He [transforms Van Gogh's paintings into
bodies, emphasising their synesthetic properties and the visceral
corporeal forces they mobilise]{.underline}, they are 'remise à même la
vue, la ouïe, le tact, l'arôme' ('[restored directly to sight, hearing,
touch, smell]{.underline}').20 Whilst [Artaud here seems]{.underline},
as with his adaptations of Lewis Carroll, [to ingest and regurgitate Van
Gogh's work to produce it anew]{.underline}, he argues that [Van Gogh
carries out similarly embodied transforma- tions of his raw material,
nature]{.underline}: 'Van Gogh est peintre parce qu'il a recolleté la
nature, qu'il l'a comme retranspirée et fait suer' ('[Van Gogh is a
painter because he recollected nature, because he re-perspired it and
made it sweat').]{.underline}21 In what has since become Van Gogh's most
famous painting, [Artaud describes how he]{.underline} sees 'le visage
rouge sanglant du peintre venir à moi, dans une muraille de tournesols
éventrés' ('[the blood-red face of the painter coming toward me, in a
wall of eviscerated sunflowers').22 Van Gogh's work is rendered violent,
interspersed with Artaudian blows, hammering, shredding, collisions,
jostling, tearing, welding, nerves and the]{.underline} 'météorique
d'atomes' ('[meteoric bombardment of atoms']{.underline}).23

[Van Gogh is]{.underline}, according to Artaud, [picking and chiselling
away at his own subjectile, that of the canvas but also nature itself
rendered a surface to be torn through in order to reveal the forces at
work behind it.]{.underline} Artaud quotes a letter Van Gogh wrote to
his brother in which he describes how he envisages the act of drawing:

Qu'est-ce que dessiner? Comment y arrive-t-on? C'est l'action de se
frayer un passage à travers un mur de fer invisible, qui semble se trou-
ver entre ce qu'on sent et ce que l'on peut. Comment doit-on traverser
ce mur, car il ne sert de rien d'y frapper fort? On doit miner ce mur et
le traverser à la lime, lentement et avec patience à mon sens.

([What is drawing? How does one do it? It is the act of working one's
way through an invisible wall]{.underline} of iron [which seems to lie
between what one feels and what one can do. How is one to get through
this wall, for it does no good to use force? In my opinion, one must
undermine the wall and file one's way through, slowly and with
patience]{.underline}.)24

Yet in A[rtaud's vision of Van Gogh's work, it seems that this invisible
wall is not undermined or slowly and patiently filed, but exploded,
bombarded onto the surface of the canvas, in an act designed
to]{.underline} 'faire jaillir une force tournante, un élément arraché
en plein coeur' ('[make a whirling force, an element torn right out of
the heart, gush forth]{.underline}').25 [Artaud's subjectile is inspired
by Van Gogh's description of the invis- ible wall]{.underline}, which
[recalls the immense boundaries Artaud identified in his early texts
between the body, or what one really feels, and its expression in words,
through poetry]{.underline}. In fact, [Artaud seems at times to read Van
Gogh's work as if it were a linguistic text, the brush strokes or dashes
and marks on the canvas becoming forms of punctuation, as he
describes]{.underline} 'l'épouvantable pression élémentaire
d'apostrophes, de stries, de virgules, de barres' ('the awful elementary
pressure of apos- trophes, hyphens, commas and dashes').26 As readers,
[we might be tempted to read Artaud's reading of Van Gogh back into his
own draw- ings, and see the dots and lines as punctuation marks, an
expression of visual grammar in a move that both merges together and
disrupts the relationship between drawing and written word.]{.underline}

#### the enlightenment-era subject reduces affect, feeling and emotion to a singular function of emotion. This fails to account for the ways affect provides a space and metric for experiencing empathy and joy along with hate or dejection. Art education can act as an antidote to positivism employed in traditional education spaces. In secondary education, art provides a space of transgression and unbounded affective expression. 

**Addison 11**, (Nick, teaches on teaching and learning exchange at the
University of the Arts in London "Moments of Intensity: Affect and the
Making and Teaching of Art," *International Journal of Art & Design
Education,* Volume 30, Issue 3, October 20, 2011, p. 363--378)//jh

Despite the importance of affect for making, a concern for the affective
register of production rarely enters the discourse of philosophy,
especially aesthetics, a site where the art educator might hope to find
support. Within philosophy, [the trio affect/feeling/emotion is often
subsumed by the latter term, emotion]{.underline}. Although somewhat
reductive, it could be argued that from Socrates and Plato onwards
reason and emotion were constituted as a binary opposition. Within this
paradigm the [emotions are associated with base passions, supposedly
irrational forces that distort the self-possession of rational
thought.]{.underline} Over the centuries [this hierarchy has been played
out in the discourses of age, class, gender, race, religion and
sexuality, so that the white, male Enlightenment subject with his
concern for universal rights, the rule of law and natural justice, has
come to characterise right thinking]{.underline}. [In contradistinction,
other perspectives have been infantalised and/or debased.
Descartes]{.underline} (1596--1650), in his Passions of the Soul (1646),
[recognises the]{.underline} hold the [passions]{.underline} possess
over human action, [but]{.underline} he [tends to fear their 'animal'
violence]{.underline} and promotes both caution and restraint.
[Spinoza]{.underline} (1632--77) [claims a dominant role for them,
discussing affects, in particular, as]{.underline} those [energies that
pass between people]{.underline}; [relational intensities]{.underline}.
[He claims]{.underline} (1677, 232): '[We strive to further]{.underline}
the occurrence of [whatever]{.underline} we imagine [will lead to Joy,
and to avert]{.underline} or destroy [what we imagine is contrary to it,
or will lead to Sadness']{.underline}, conditions that respectively
encourage and inhibit our power to act (the latter being an exact
correlative to Tomkins' understanding of shame). Hume (1711--76),
provocatively, inverted the binary arguing that 'reason is, and ought
only to be the slave of the passions' (1739--40). Thus, [within the
Enlightenment project itself there was a concern to show how the
passions are not some bestial remnant of our animal
inheritance]{.underline} (not only a Descartian perspective but a danger
in later Darwinian interpretations), [but capacities through which
empathy, love or beauty are possible as well as hate, jealousy or
abjection. Deleuze]{.underline} (2003) [argues]{.underline} that [in the
twentieth century it has been artists]{.underline}, not philosophers,
[who]{.underline}, by engaging with affect, [have worked at the limits
of intelligibility and have thus engendered new concepts]{.underline}.
[The field of the arts is]{.underline}, then, a place [where attention
to the]{.underline} nature of the [affect/feeling/emotion triad
is]{.underline} not only discussed but [enacted]{.underline}: from an
Aristotlean position, for cathartic reasons (see Halliwell 1998,
351--6); for Pope Gregory I, as exemplary forces (see Janson & Janson
2004, 384), for Kant (1790), to ensure a community of rapture; for
Brecht, to destabilise hegemonic structures (see Benjamin 1998), for
Butler (1990) to undo the founding binary of gender; for Bourriaud
(2002) to enable intersubjective transformations. As may be noted, these
affect/emotion potentialities are not primarily representational but
agentive, they do things to us. Affect and pedagogy [How then do affects
inform pedagogic processes? Affects are, after all, the sensations that
demand we act]{.underline}. If Tomkins's six negatives are outlawed in
education, albeit present and thus disavowed, the
constructive/destructive duality of infant phantasy is, throughout life,
central to creative action (see Klein 1975; Britzman 2003). Perhaps
then, [in the context of secondary art education in particular, art
promises a hybrid, transgressive space, an antidote to the instrumental
positivism that elsewhere characterises so much schooling]{.underline}
(see Addison 2011). Nonetheless, it should also be noted that the two
positive affects, interest and pleasure, tend to be central aims in the
planning of learning situations, while the neutral category, surprise,
is often used to ensure the first and to punctuate learning's more
quotidian moments. It could be said that in the instance discussed next,
a teacher deploys surprise as a mechanism to move a student from a state
of psychic prohibition to one of cultural enquiry.

#### Art class allows for transgression: though deviance may be necessary for discipline to exist, the student's actions are a form of wasteful expenditure -- emotion and affect are both expressed through art, but are confined to the curricular limitations that art classes bring -- this limits out affective expression and channels emotionality into standardized forms of expression. The art classroom can be harnessed as a space of curricular transgression through affective expression.

**Addison 11**, (Nick Addison, Moments of Intensity: Affect and the
Making and Teaching of Art. International Journal of Art & Design
Education, published 2011, p. 363--378)//jh

My concern here is to investigate [a two-fold instance of
transgression]{.underline} which [took place within the context of art
and design education]{.underline}. As an event [the instance comprises
two acts: the first, a collective one in which a class of secondary
school students produce a set of drawings which appear to refuse the
symbolic order]{.underline} (the network of rules, prohibitions and
customs constituting normative relations); [the second, a response to
the drawings by their art and design student teacher in the form of a
sculptural installation.]{.underline}1 [The second act is a resolution
of sorts, one that destabilises the binary opposition
transgress/conform, the very opposition that invites me in the first
place to designate transgression as the object of study.
Both]{.underline} acts [question expectations about the role and limits
of representation around the body, the first inventing]{.underline} a
series of scatological, [violent and sexualised
interactions]{.underline}, [abject or 'dirty' images that configure
bodily undifferentiation and affective excess, while the second explores
the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate
discourses.]{.underline} [The first act might be construed as an act of
wilful resistance,]{.underline} a refutation or denial of normativity
[but]{.underline}, as Jenks (2003) argues, (rearticulating Bataille,
1957): '[transgressive behaviour... does not deny limits or boundaries,
rather it exceeds and thus completes them. Every rule, limit, boundary
or edge carries with it its own fracture, penetration or impulse to
disobey']{.underline} (2003: 7). [In this two-fold event there is then
an instance of a reaching beyond the limits, both of representational
decorum and of the fiduciary behavioural pact between teacher and
student that constitutes order. It could be argued that such deviance
from the norm constitutes the inevitability of transgression for, in the
context of schooling]{.underline}, as with other disciplinary
institutions, [deviant behaviour is a necessary presence, one that must
be produced if boundaries are to be sustained]{.underline}.2 [In this
sense the students' actions might be characterised as an inversion of
normative power relations or]{.underline} perhaps [an opportunity to
upset the]{.underline} professed [utility]{.underline} and progressivist
[tenets of bourgeois education through wasteful expenditure]{.underline}
(Bataille, 1985), [excessive performances that go beyond the limits only
to re-establish and reinforce the taboos they transgress.]{.underline}
Although Bataille provides an entry into a social event that has
perplexed me over a number of years, I have found it necessary to refer
to object relations theory to help me explore the affective territories
of the participants and their implications for art as a 'potential
space' (Winnicott, 1971a). This phrase was coined by Winnicott to define
a space of action produced in infancy: neither internal nor external,
psychic nor material, it is rather an imaginary space in which the
tensions between internal and external forces can be explored and
navigated. The apparatus for this exploration is play - initially
through use of a 'transitional object', the first 'not me' object - a
type of symbolic and thus transformational action that Winnicott
identified with creativity and its development into the cultural sphere,
whether as art or science. [It is also necessary to consider the
relationship between affect and emotion, the latter being a recognised
object of study within works of art, certainly from the point of view of
reception, and within theories of expression, from the point of view of
production. But]{.underline} as Lyotard (1991) enunciates: '...th[e
work]{.underline} is not merely a cultural object, although it is that
too. It [harbours within it an excess, a rapture, a potential of
associations that overflows all the determinations of its "reception"
and "production"']{.underline} (p. 93). [On the one hand students are
invited to engage with their emotional life by using it as a source for
expression and/or analysis. Affect, on the other hand, when understood
as pre-reflective]{.underline} (a phenomenon experienced [as the
surfacing of instinctual drives, felt with the urgency and immediacy of
desire, as 'moments of intensity') is altogether more
dangerous]{.underline}. Emotions are the culturally determined modes
through which affects are drawn into social relations and shaped as
expressions of feeling; a mixture of affect, reflection and
articulation. In this sense emotion tames affect, brings it into the
domain of signification and thus available for cognitive work. The
alternative registers of the arts, those intensities outside semiosis,
reconfigure affect as 'sensation',3 not cognised but felt, bodily[. For
the overflow of excess to be acknowledged, conventionalised means of
emotional expression need to be circumvented.]{.underline} Deleuze has
assiduously promoted an anti-philosophy to do just this (eg. Deleuze and
Guattari, 1988), but I do not wish to be drawn down his path here;
[Bataille already prefigures Deleuzian thought. In his writings on the
paintings of Lascaux, Bataille]{.underline} (2005) [recognises the
representational function of the imagery: clearly there are people and
bison etc., but he argues that the essence of the paintings is
performative. For him the cave is a ritual space, a place in which the
making of the work is an event, not an object for reading or
contemplation, but a space in which to act.]{.underline} There has been
much work on children's painting recently that theorises the
performative nature of children's creative production, (Atkinson, 2002,
2008; Matthews, 2003). [The space given to young children to work/play
in early years schooling without preconceived learning outcomes affords
them a space within which to explore sensation, not only the landscape
of their perceptions but their feelings of affection and fear, a world
of familiars and monsters. These multimodal paintings/enactions, are
configured in the moment, in complete and sometimes rapturous absorption
as the event unfolds.]{.underline} [Once children enter the
world]{.underline} of the National Curriculum, [this space is taken away
(although remnants of its freedoms are retained within arts subjects). I
do not wish to imply that the arts, and art design in particular, should
only be concerned with affect and emotionality; the arts necessarily
engage with forms of representation, semiosis and the construction of
shared languages]{.underline} (Addison et al., 2010). [Nevertheless,
they do offer a space in which these fundamental aspects of what it is
to be human can be recognised and acknowledged in practice. The event I
look at here is more a rupture than a rapture, an affective interruption
in an over-determined curriculum where the emotional lives of students
tend to be marginalised and their affective intensities
outlawed]{.underline}. I must, however, admit to methodological
difficulties. The investigation is obstructed from the outset due to the
nature of the evidence at my disposal. First, an oral account of the
students' transgression reported to me by the teacher responsible for
the lesson in which the drawings were made, let me call him Jack, an Art
and Design PGCE4 student I tutored in 1999. Second, a series of
sculptures modelled by Jack in response to these drawings which he
exhibited collectively as an installation for his final PGCE
assignment.5 It was therefore some four months after the event that Jack
conceived and made the sculptures working directly from a selection of
the drawings and in discussion with me. The installation consisted of
three major figurines loosely based on Michelangelo's David (1504) for
which Jack appropriated or, more appositely, incorporated parts of the
students' drawings. He used these parts as a collection of prostheses to
be grafted on to the three figurines and surrounded them with smaller
attendants (see Fig. 1 above). As a form of evidence, the event,
comprising the school students' transgressive drawings and Jack's
response, is, in a sense, a two-fold transgression.6

#### Bataille's reworking of the dispotif of seeing is comparable to being blinded and torn apart. Through the unraveling of semiotic coherence and admittance of the night, we create our own art: cannibalization of bourgeois values and "outbidding" art as a concept, refusing limitations and categorizations of art, reorienting the project of art towards the repugnant, violating rather than consoling.

**Tiryakian 14**, (Edward Tiryakian. \"Durkheim, The Durkheimians and
the Arts.\" Canadian Journal of Sociology, published 2014, p. 765-774)

Georges [Bataille]{.underline} was an enemy of "art." He [loathed all
that attempted to redeem the base with appeals to the lofty, cultivated
a sustained distrust of "absolutes" and "beauty," and saw through the
hypocrisies of high culture and other bourgeois loci of distinction and
anxiety]{.underline}. It would then appear misguided to speak of
"Bataille and art." However, [Bataille was not simply an aesthetic
reactionary. Rather he suggested a reworking of the dispositif of
"seeing" which, in his view, should be tantamount to being blinded and
indeed torn apart. The capstone of knowledge is found in the dialectical
inversion of the positivist gaze, in the blind spot of reason and in the
liminal passage between the human and its Other. This "site" is moreover
one constituted by the unraveling of semiotic coherence and the descent
into non-form, night, and void. And paradoxically, it is from within the
interstices between this night and the black hole of the eyes that
Bataille's "aesthetic" begins; art, if it was to exist for Bataille, was
a bastion of dark sensuality where the aesthetic is swallowed by the
ecstatic and the value of the work is found in its capacity to call into
question the very nature of human project.]{.underline} The Bataillean
aesthetic thus cannot be illuminated if one remains bound in
conventional notions of art as the province of the painterly, the
writerly, the plastic, and the beaux. Bataille tried to outbid art.
[Outbidding art moved by way of the subversion and refusal of art's
formal and structural limitations, its history, its pretensions, in
favor of a repositioning of the aesthetic in what it uncomfortably flees
from---flies, excreta, howls]{.underline}. In a broader sense, [Bataille
outbid ethics, epistemology, and all forms of totemism through a rabid
aesthetic that violated rather than consoled]{.underline}. While
"outbidding" does mean befouling beauty, it also means [displacing
reading practices and bringing sensorial experience to grapple with that
which it perpetually disavows. What this would entail would be nothing
short of a project to collapse aesthetic habitus which, in its aversion
to the repugnant, canalizes the apprehension of the beautiful into
certain ideal forms. "Beauty" is neurotic.]{.underline}

#### In standard educational settings, emotion is totally divested from education. The release of emotional energy is confined to set times and spaces where it is channeled through systems of social production, while during learning sessions it is completely suppressed. The only potential activity in which students can release or make use of emotional energy on an individual level is unbounded art. Through anonymous and co-authored art, students expressed raw emotional energies through depiction of the body as a site of the intersection of social relations.

- if the body is the debate space, our art can be used to express the
  lacerated and grafted-over points of interaction that stuff like
  framework ignores or tries to smooth over.

- not entirely sure how this would work in terms of an actual classroom,
  but that's also an avenue. The whole article is about a teacher's
  experience with his students and their transgressive depictions of the
  body.

[Within the classroom, emotional experience is implicitly understood to
interfere with the central task of interested if dispassionate
learning]{.underline} (Noddings, 2005). [In this sense the domain of the
curriculum subject]{.underline}, its objective criteria, [is posited as
entirely separate from the emotions]{.underline}. The emotional life of
the student is not the stuff of the cognitive curriculum, that is unless
it is deferred onto others and represented in salutary form (whether in
film, literature, painting, TV etc.) and which can thus be subject to
reasoned analysis. [Special moments are designated for the release of
emotional energy, playtime, or for the dissemination of collective
praise and/or admonition, assemblies. Inter-student affection or enmity
is outlawed during lessons despite the fact that its matrix of
intensities subtends the superstructure of learning. In this sense the
emotions are either objectified or pathologised. The only other space
where they are legitimised is within 'creative activities' where they
are channelled through highly determined forms of cultural production,
collectively known as 'expression', such as art, dance, music, poetry,
the conventions of which may not necessarily coincide with students'
habitus.]{.underline} These [drawings, however]{.underline}, in [being
co-authored and arbitrary, built on contiguous rather than continuous
relations, belie the tenets of formalist composition or authenticity
that underpin understandings of expression]{.underline}11; therefore,
for the students [the exercise was 'other' to school art]{.underline}.
In the event, Jack did instruct them to base these co-drawings on one of
the well-worn tropes of art education, the human figure. But [rather
than explore the body as a singular, mimetic, aesthetic or symbolic
entity,]{.underline} as might be expected, [many students used the
activity as a vehicle through which to look at social relationships.
They did so by visualising their inter-personal experiences through a
sort of free association, where the folded paper became a multi-screen
space somewhat akin to a day-dream]{.underline}. Here, the [students
began to unravel a scene of the power relations to which they felt
subject, relations indicated through spatial juxtapositions and spoken
utterance]{.underline} (the latter represented as text inserted into
speech bubbles). [In this way the students deployed 'words']{.underline}
(and actions) '[that wound']{.underline} (Appelbaum, 2003) [piecing
together a scene of abusive and violent interactions indicative of the
fearful aspects of peer relations and student/parent and student/teacher
communications, a neurotic and potentially paranoid position rather than
necessarily psychotic. The part played by gender was inextricably linked
to sexuality, 'inappropriate', misaligned gender signifiers being
deployed as a marker of non-normative sexuality, a means particularly of
attacking the masculine credibility of the father/teacher
figure]{.underline}. In terms of overt sexualisation the erect penis, as
a primary sexual form, was notable (after all, it explicitly and thus
efficiently signals arousal) whereas in terms of secondary forms, female
breasts were represented as were a number of anal images (in the service
of both excremental use and 'masturbation'). Amongst other abusive
terms, the word 'mother' was frequently invoked as an insult (an
abbreviation of the term 'mother fucker' understood as such in the late
1990s). [Students also used scale to suggest the dominance or
subordinance of the players]{.underline} (although the larger of the two
in a pairing did not always come off best) [and one interaction included
a stabbing]{.underline}.

#### the surrealist construction of the exquisite corpse refuses the seamless coherence of the traditional aesthetic body -- in this way we incorporate imagery of scarred and grafted sites where limbs are attached and removed, reconfiguring the body through a series of metonymic replacements, displaying a hybrid body composed of phantasy and desire. The analysis of this surreal corpse functions to both deconstruct the imposed dualities of the traditional body and functionally force the space portrayed as a site of affective interaction to cannibalize the representation of itself

- thinking we can use this as a "make debate cannibalize / fix itself"
  solvency / advocate card. IDK if I need more specificity there, but if
  we frame whatever art we talk about as representative of the
  interactions within the debate space, this card definitely works as
  solvency (it talks about the teacher consuming the values that led the
  students to draw the pictures and changing accordingly).

Methodologically Jack uses a type of three-dimensional collage,
re-appropriating [the 'cadaver exquise' of both the Surrealists and the
teenage students]{.underline}. In this way he [undermines traditional
aesthetic conventions by refusing 'material finish, semantic coherence,
seamless narrative, and the integration of parts into the body of the
text]{.underline}... \[[rather\] in surrealist collage the scars left by
the grafting of spare limbs remain visible]{.underline}' (Adamowicz,
2005: 15). [This succession of sutures makes visible the cumulative
process of inscription/representation, a temporality that belies the
immediacy and unity of the pictorial imaginary. But the exquisite corpse
dislocates expected modes of reception yet further as it moves from the
intentional heterogeneity of collage, the artist as conscious author of
meaningful juxtapositions, onto a different plane through its
incorporation of chance contiguities]{.underline}. This has the result
of [reconfiguring the body through a sequence of metonymic
displacements: ...in surrealism, metonymical mechanisms are... pushed to
their limits]{.underline}. Where traditional metonymy draws its
signifiers from the same semantic field... the lexicon of [the
surrealist body flouts the rules of anatomical coherence, producing a
hybrid body. The limbs of the exquisite corpse remain spare parts,
scarcely interlocking; their disparate character is
irreducible]{.underline}... (Adamowicz, 2005: 82). In this sense the
dirtied Davids become a locus for arbitrary or possibly subconscious
forces, an assemblage of external and internal part-objects indicative
of the sadistic impulses of infancy. Klein (1991a) argues that during
the period of ego development in infancy the human child is dominated by
violent impulses in which good and bad sensations are attributed to
objects: initially parts, such as the mother's breast, and later to
other objects and whole persons. The child gradually introjects these
objects to form her/his ego while simultaneously projecting them back
into the external world. The inevitable scarcity of good parts (those
elements that satisfy desire) produces anxiety (particularly a fear of
loss) an anxiety which the persecutory nature of the bad parts only
increases. The child thus constructs defence mechanisms, phantasising
attacks, particularly on the breast and then on the mother/father
(initially imagined as one); this involves, splitting, disintegration
and a sort of cannibalism. The severity of these attacks produces a
further anxiety, that of retaliation and retribution: Klein terms this
the 'paranoid-schizoid position'. Once the child is able to conceive of
the other as a whole s/he comes to understand that good and bad are
coexistent in the same person; s/he then feels guilt and the need for
reparation; this is called the 'depressive position'.12 Why are these
theories of infancy significant for this paper? As Winnicott (1971b: 82)
contends when looking at 'the origins of creativity': 'Klein takes up
the idea of the destructiveness of the baby and gives it proper emphasis
at the same time making a new and vital issue out of the idea of the
fusion of erotic and destructive impulses as a sign of health'. In other
words, [the potential space afforded by symbolic play is a necessary
mechanism to assuage the rage and terror the child endures once s/he
realises s/he is no longer omnipotent]{.underline}, that is once the
mother/carer denies the child immediate gratification through the
process of weaning. Klein (1975: 251) herself argues: '[Phantasies -
becoming more elaborate and referring to a wider variety of objects and
situations - continue throughout development and accompany all
activities; they never stop playing a great part in mental life. The
influence of unconscious phantasy on art, on scientific work, and on the
activities of everyday life cannot be overrated']{.underline}. In the
instance in question, the drawings, an attack on Jack's perceived
inadequacies, are figured as infantile sadistic projections onto the
figure of the father and his reign of order. I contend that [it was the
vehicle of the exquisite corpse itself that conditioned a lessening of
inhibitions so that the spontaneously engineered attack took on the
symbolism of infantile phantasy]{.underline}. As a means to engage with
the ambivalent feelings that these drawings might, even subconsciously,
have produced, Jack, retroactively, carefully designed [a making
process]{.underline} in which he [deconstructed a sequence of chained
binaries suggested by the drawings: legitimate/illegitimate,
beautiful/grotesque, ideal/base matter]{.underline} (Jack was well aware
of artists who utilised Derridian deconstruction, see for example Taylor
(1999) on Tansey). [Under the auspices of deconstructive method these
binaries were put into play but with recourse to the techniques of
splitting, incorporation and possibly reparation. It is my contention
that Jack deployed these 'techniques' as a means to overcome the
patterns of exclusion reactivated by the aggression and traumas of the
students' transgression]{.underline}. He achieved this [in such a way
that he 'actively \[conceived\] multiple opposites or antitheses
simultaneously']{.underline} (Rothenberg's description for creativity
within the Janusian project, 1996). In this way [he ingests,
cannibalistically, the destructive energies so apparent in the students'
drawings]{.underline}, so that they come to animate and exceed the
potential energy of Michelangelo's David (always characterised as
focused, at a point of stasis before his heroic action). [These
excesses: the grotesquery, scatology and violent sexualisation are
deployed as antidotes to the stifling proprieties of the 'Standard'
teacher, a policing role that negates the sovereign self of the
artist/teacher.]{.underline}

#### Art allows you to embrace death = good for vtl 

**Hegarty, 2k (Paul Hegarty, author and lecturer in aesthetics at
University College Cork,  Georges Bataille: Core Cultural Theorist, pg
)/RF**

Even before [Bataille]{.underline} formulates the thought of the general
economy, his [writings on art]{.underline} point the way towards it,
[reject]{.underline}ing [the modern period\'s separation of culture into
distinct spheres (Lessing, Kant).]{.underline} Instead, [**he seeks to
bring art into contact with sacrifice, eroticism, violence and with
questions of the origin and functioning of societies**. Art
occupies]{.underline} a clear place in the ceuvre of Bataille as [part
of the movement of that which is \'beyond but not
transcendent.]{.underline} Excessive would not be transcendent because
that would imply it was conveying some true spiritual value. Much [art
fails to be excessive, content to depict, rather than
\'communicate\']{.underline}, is Bataille\'s general argument, but
**[art can be part of sovereignty, general economy.]{.underline}** This
echoes what he writes about poetry, which often features as part of a
list of things that exceed the everyday, \'restricted economy, while
also being often worthy only of contempt. The text that we encounter
today as readers, however, sites [art]{.underline}, in Bataille, **[as
part of the troubled boundary that defines our existence and the
inevitable possibility of our death.]{.underline}** Bataille would
reject the term \'aesthetics as it already concedes the defeat of art,
its restriction to a certain realm, which entails its placement as part
of an economy of utility, within which the end and means are clear. This
does not prevent him effectively from \'doing aesthetics, at certain
points, but we should be wary of defining a Bataillean aesthetics. At
another [level there could feasibly be a very obvious \'Bataillean
aesthetics\* - one which would valorize art that aspired to
destruction.]{.underline} This can operate at two levels, one formal,
the other to do with content. [Bataille]{.underline} only [favours art
that is in some way the destruction of art, such that the working and
place of art can be revealed, but often this takes a very literal or
figurative form:]{.underline} Bataille is very literal-minded in this,
and does have much more of an interest in art that depicts scenes of
violence, anguish and so on. 1 Krauss and Bois have signalled, in
Formless: A User\'s Guide, that along with this focus on content,
Bataille seems wilfully ignorant of key developments in modern art, and
misses out on areas where formal experimentation would feasibly link up
more fruitfully with his thought. Various questions arise when looking
at Bataille\'s take on art (I am specifically addressing the visual arts
here), some of which are Bataille\'s questions, and others of which are
brought to us through the text, despite Bataille\'s particular, explicit
emphases. Firstly, what is the place of art - this is perhaps the big
question of the pre-war texts; secondly, what kind of subjectivity do we
see in the figure of the artist; thirdly, and this is where we need to
extrapolate, what is the role, function or position of representation
and figuration in the light of the general economy? [**The Place of Art
for us today, the most obvious place for art is the museum.**
Reproducibility of the work of art, in the form of images in books, or
on websites, only serves to extend the museum]{.underline} (although it
might alter what it is). For Bataille, [**the museum is one of the
exemplary sites where our culture becomes a culture of death, rather
than a culture which has a link to death through sacrifice**. The museum
sanitizes both art and the unpleasantness of everyday life: \' a museum
is like the lungs of a city - every Sunday the crowds flow through the
museum like blood, coming out purified and fresh]{.underline}
(\'Museum\', 22; OC I, 239). Like many writers, Bataille accepts that
**[for modern Western culture, art in some measure occupies the space
vacated by religion,]{.underline}** but he has his own particular take
on this phenomenon. [The crowd]{.underline} - the mass - streaming
through the halls of culture [maintains an attitude of reverence, even a
\'profound communion]{.underline} (23; 240) with the objects,
[but]{.underline} these [objects,]{.underline} at least in this setting,
[are not worthy, do not represent something communal,]{.underline} in
Bataille\'s sense, [as \'the paintings are only dead
surfaces]{.underline} (22; 239). **[It is the coming together as a crowd
that interests Bataille]{.underline}**. In short, [museums provide a
cleansing function, ensuring that the desire to exceed mundanity is
constrained to the Sunday visit to the museum]{.underline} (the
development of \'leisure fulfils a similar function), **[and the art
itself can lose any danger it may have held.]{.underline}** In a sense
prior to all this, however, is Bataille\'s claim that **[the display of
culture hides the spectacle of death that allowed culture to come to the
people. The modern museum as we know it \'would thus be linked to the
development of the guillotine]{.underline}** (22; 239). For Bataille,
[Western architecture]{.underline} (including its antecedents[) has
always sought to cover up death. Our view of the birth of humanity
centres not just on a philosophical recognition of death as defining
humanity, but also on the built commemorations that we find even among
the Neanderthals.]{.underline} As Hollier notes, in Against
Architecture, Bataille writes against this architecture and the
architecture of thought that accompanies it[. Architecture, especially
in the form of the monumental (]{.underline}official) [building, imposes
itself as power.]{.underline} It is more than simply a reflection of
power. [the ideal being of society, that which orders and prohibits with
authority, expresses itself in what are architectural compositions in
the strict sense of the term.]{.underline} Thus, the great monuments are
raised up like dams, pitting the logic of majesty and authority against
all the shady elements: it is in the form of cathedrals and palaces that
Church and State speak and impose silence on the multitudes. (Bataille,
\'Architecture\', 21; OC 1,171) Bataille is reflexive as to his own
position on the status of architecture. [As \'the human order is bound
up from the start with the architectural order]{.underline} (21; 172),
[you cannot attack one without attacking the other.]{.underline} In this
early article we see **[the firm rejection of humanism as something tied
up with authority, imbued with use value and the refusal of
excess.]{.underline}** Lest we think that the heroic artist combats
this, Bataille notes that \'the great compositions of certain painters
express the will to restrict the spirit to an official ideal (21; 171).
This is not because there is a dominant ideology that filters down from
the State, but because [all areas of society partake of order in its own
right.]{.underline} He is not referring to art and patronage or Official
art\', but to certain forms of art, as \'the disappearance of academic
construction in painting, on the other hand, leaves the way open for
expression (even going as far as exaltation) of psychological processes
that are most incompatible with social stability\* (ibid.). Modern art
can be a way of going \'against architecture\*. **[A r t and the Sacred
Modern art does not,]{.underline}** for Bataille, **[do something that
is totally new. It partake s of something that all societies, except
early modern a nd moder n Western society, have known: the importanc e
of excess, sacrifice, eroticism and death. So modern art is the
restoration of a lost continuity. This continuity is not a return, as
something ha s altered: we no longer believe in the existence of fixed
truths.]{.underline}** It appears after the fact that [art, no longer
capable of expressing whatever it is that, coming to it from outside, is
incontestably sacred - romanticism having used up the possibilities of
renewal - it appears after the fact that art could no longer live if it
did not have the force to attain the sacred instant by its own
resources.]{.underline} The techniques put into play up to that point
only had to express a given that had its own value and meaning. (The
Sacred\', 241; OC I, 561) [Art of the early modern period]{.underline}
(prior to mid-nineteenth-century modernism) [actually seems to have
maintained a link with values]{.underline} (of truth, of beauty**[) that
it was supposed to shed in becoming autonomous, and Bataille is actually
suggesting that art first become more autonomous to undo its
autonomy.]{.underline}** Such is the condition of art that come s after
the death of God - now [there is nowhere to hide: the modern era offers
the sacred, as earlier societies did, but this time with only emptiness
behind or within it.]{.underline} As a result, [whoever creates, whoever
paints or writes, can no longer concede any limitations on painting or
writing]{.underline}; alone, [he suddenly has at his disposal all
possible human convulsions, and he cannot flee from this heritage of
divine power which belongs to him.]{.underline} Nor can he know if this
heritage will consume and destroy the one it consecrates. (The Sacred\',
245; OC I, 563) So **[Bataille sees the period when modern art comes
into being as a time of access, when what he would later call the
\'sovereign artist\' is in the same position as the sacrificer in
societies with a conception of the violence of the
sacred.]{.underline}** But the beyond to which this artist accedes is
just a beyond - there is no content there. In his early writings in
particular, we see Bataille emphasizing the personal aspect of the
artist, in an attempt to delineate possible sacrificial paths for
sovereignty. **[Van Gogh provides the paradigm for the artist as
sacrificer, and Bataille is just as fascinated by Van Gogh\'s cutting
off his ear as by the paintings. For Bataille, the two a re not simply
phenomena we could ascribe to Van Gogh\'s individual madness. Rather,
Van Gogh has found what the Aztec priests had with regard to the sun:
there is something beyond the self that the self can lose itself
in]{.underline}** (\'Sacrificial Mutilation and the Severed Ear of Van
Gogh\', OC I, 262). The cutting of the ear released the sun to come
through Van Gogh (\'Van Gogh Promethee\', OC 1,499). **[It is not that
this artist has acquired something - rather he has lost the restraints
that made him a unified subject, through the \'expenditure that
threatens stable existence]{.underline}** (OC I, 498), **[and has moved
into a realm of \'inner experience\']{.underline}** (\'Sacrificial
Mutilation and the Severed Ear of Van Gogh\', 67; OC I, 264). [The
artist is called on by Bataille to be more than just an
artist]{.underline} (who in accepting such a role accepts the dominance
of use value), [but where artists are not supposed to go is down the
path of commitment (engagement), as he continually states in his postwar

#### through the creation of spaces where art can be allowed to transgress norms and taboos, we harness violence through play and creative energy. This does not necessarily abandon all ethical frames, but does provide a space within which otherwise violent energies can maximize creative potentials.

Bataille (2001) assumed that [violence is at the core of all social
change]{.underline}, [necessary for the formation of human culture and
manifest in religion through sacrifice. Similarly]{.underline}, within
the school of Object Relations, [aggression is a necessary component for
health]{.underline}: for Klein (1991b) [in the form of
play]{.underline}, as a means [to act out symbolically what is socially
and ethically impossible]{.underline}, for Winnicott (1971b) [as a life
force, a creative energy]{.underline}. The instance examined in this
paper thus revolves [around a difficult issue for schooling, aggression,
a phenomenon necessarily policed in the context of
bullying]{.underline}. [But the significance of Winnicott's 'potential
space' lies not in the practising of violence but in harnessing
aggressive energies for transformative use]{.underline} as in the case
of Jack. Winnicott (1965) theorised the mother figure as both a
biological nurturer and an environmental facilitator/protector. He
argued that it is only when 'alone' (by which he means attentive to some
matter in hand but within the protective gaze of the mother) that the
infant 'is able to become unintegrated, to flounder, to be in a state in
which there is no orientation, to be able to exist for a time without
being either a reactor to an external impingement or an active person
with a direction of interest or movement' (1965: 34). This ambivalent
state is the precursor to the necessary conditions for creative action,
a space that is outside moral obligations, and thus the taboos that
society imposes. [It is therefore a place without transgression, where
intensities are accepted, or perhaps, rather like Bataille's notion of
the sacred, a place where the breaking of taboos is
permissible.]{.underline} It could be argued that [art is the secular
heir of religion, a ritualised space for the transgression of norms. In
the bourgeois spaces of schooling this is perhaps the best that can be
hoped for]{.underline}. The students' [action was an attack on bourgeois
authority, a spontaneous eruption in which the affective impulse to
attack found its forms in infantile phantasy]{.underline}. Rearticulated
with recourse to the technical armoury of adolescent representation, [it
produced an excess]{.underline}, indeed [a plethora of
abjection]{.underline}. Despite the attack, on the surface Jack remained
unaffected, for he did not use the transgression as an excuse to
reinstate order. Rather, he accepted the violence of the perpetrators,
conceiving it as an excess of energy which he utilised to feed his
creative act of restitution. [Within the potential space of art, the
sculptural installation allowed Jack to work through the ambivalent
feelings of the schizophrenic, sadomasochistic position Act I had placed
him in]{.underline}. There are different degrees of ambivalence however.
While making visible the 'knowingness' of childhood, a phenomenon often
denied in art education (Burgess, 2003), the legitimised object of
Jack's assault, nominally youthful courage and beauty embodied in the
David, is itself already degraded. With reference to the plaster cast in
the V&A Jack merely despoils a replica, and by working on a table-top
scale it could be the souvenir, rather than the original and its
surrogates, that is the object of his accretions. [Art and design, as an
other to the core curriculum, does a certain violence to the bourgeois
economy of schooling, but its potential to recognise and allow affective
responses]{.underline} (the symbolic attack noted here) [is tamed by its
relegation to recreation. Limited acts of transgression]{.underline}
(both by students and teachers) [might meet the necessity for the
teacher to retain at least a measure of sovereignty through
exercising]{.underline} [willful moments of dirtying]{.underline}, a
mixing up of categories [to destabilise the oppressive structures of a
'petty' bourgeois moral order that would swamp affective
energies]{.underline}, creative or otherwise. Jenks (2003: 109) argues,
paraphrasing Gallop: 'Striving for sovereignty ensures a breakdown of
hierarchies and a scrambling of the proper, worthy, replicable, true
with the dirty, untidy, obscene and peculiar'. My conclusion is
uncertain. [There are dangers in accepting affect without reference to
some ethical frame]{.underline}.13 The instance I reflect on here has
only been discussed and represented within the university, not [within
the school where the first act took place]{.underline}. In the latter [I
have no doubt that it would have been received as a transgression too
far]{.underline}, both the production of the drawings and their
acceptance by Jack. [Nonetheless, I am aware of schools where this event
could be aired, where the drawings and the installation might be
exhibited, but they are few. What this paper aims to achieve is to open
up a debate to consider how affect might be acknowledged within the
curriculum in addition to its status as an analytical object within the
wider social life of schooling. **Perhaps what is called for are
specific spaces where students and teachers are given permission to
exercise forms of ritual transgression**, places **where emotional norms
are suspended for an instance so as to enable the unsayable to be
voiced**.]{.underline} Winnicott's 'potential space' can be staged
within the arts and in art and design in particular. This requires not
only moving beyond proprieties but also a loosening of intentionality,
predicted outcomes and the other over-determining paraphernalia of
audit/litigious culture towards a tolerance of ambiguity, chance, the
undifferentiated spaces of the creative imagination. Framed in this way,
these **[in-between spaces]{.underline}** (in this instance the
adolescent, the student teacher, the affective/cognitive synthesis of
art) [**allow uncertainty to be understood as a potentiality** rather
then necessarily a danger. **Art education could offer such a place**
but it is rarely given licence to do so.]{.underline}

#### Alt solvency if you're reading an art alt 

**Turpin, 10** (Turpin, Stephen, 6-1-2010, \"Aesthetics of Expenditure:
Art, Philosophy, and the Infinite Faculty,\"
https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/)/RF

With these preliminary remarks in mind, [we may now suggest how
Bataille's concept of expenditure]{.underline} \[depenser\] [is situated
in our present discussion.]{.underline} The notion of expenditure
emerges in Bataille's writing in the early 1930s. Despite the valences
of this concept within his own work, we may provisionally summarize the
concept according to his own early formulation in 'The Notion of
Expenditure': "[Human activity is not entirely reducible to processes of
production and conservation, and **consumption must be divided into two
distinction parts.** The first, reducible part is represented by the use
of the minimum necessary for the conservation of life and the
continuation of individuals' productive activity in a given society; it
is therefore a question simply of the fundamental condition of
productive activity.]{.underline}"7 Bataille continues, "The second part
is represented by socalled unproductive expenditures: luxury, mourning,
war, cults, the construction of sumptuary monuments, games, spectacles,
arts, perverse sexual activity (i.e., deflected from genital finality)
-- all these represent activities which, at least in 6 Allan Stoekl,
Bataille's Peak, p. xx. 7 Georges Bataille, "The Notion of Expenditure,"
Visions of Excess, p. 118. 7 primitive circumstances, have no end beyond
themselves[. Now it is necessary to reserve the use of the word
expenditure \[depenser\] for the designation of these unproductive
forms, and not for the designation of all the modes of consumption that
serve as a means to the end of production."8 From this point of view,
expenditure is the unproductive or wasteful exercise of energy wherein
the activity or organization facilitating such practices does not aim to
reinvest them within another regime or framework]{.underline} (i.e.
restricted economy). In the original French, it is indeed the case that
the verb depenser evokes a polysemic series of connections that exceed
the highly commercial associations of the English expenditure. Our
purpose here, however, is not to lament the limitations of translation;
[**the importance of the notion of expenditure within Bataille's
philosophy is certainly not its vernacular resonance,** but its
interrogative capacity in relation to the logic of socio-economic
organizations and their attendant articulations of utility and value
more broadly.]{.underline} Of course, we must keep in mind throughout
the present work that Bataille himself undermines the possibility of any
conclusive determination of utility in the opening paragraph of the same
essay: "Every time the meaning of a discussion depends on the
fundamental value of the word useful -- in other words, every time the
essential question touching on the life of human societies is raised, no
matter who intervenes and what opinions are expressed -- it is possible
to affirm that the debate is necessarily warped and that the fundamental
question is eluded. In fact, given the more or less divergent collection
of present ideas, there is nothing that permits one to define what is
useful to man."9 [Therefore, without lamenting the absence of a priori
or universal designations that would decide questions of utility, our
interest will be in pursuing the logic of practices of expenditure which
exacerbate the tension between utility and waste. That is, our interest
in expenditure will focus on its conceptual value as a means to
undermine processes by which apparently wasteful activities within a
broader (i.e. general) economy of energy are subsumed and reinvested
within restricted economies of Moral reason and practical
value.]{.underline} It is precisely this dimension of expenditure that
**[places Bataille's philosophy in a direct confrontation with Kant's
Critical philosophy and allows our reading of the artistic practice of
Smithson as a complimentary material articulation by way of an
aesthetics of expenditure.]{.underline}** Robert Smithson's (1938-1973)
enigmatic intellectual fecundity, autodidactic capacities, and radical
artistic production have made him a major figure within post-Minimalist
American art. Indeed, an immense field of scholarship is now readily
available regarding his work and its place within the tradition of
European and American art history and adjacent disciplines. [While a
complete account of this vast amount of scholarly work is beyond the
scope of the present dissertation, several texts have proved
indispensable for the argument that follows. Of primary importance is
the collection of Smithson's writings, edited by Jack Flam, which brings
together a wide range of essays and criticism that demonstrate
unequivocally Smithson's brilliance as a author, simultaneously evincing
his rhetorical and antagonistic interventions in art historical
discourse and hastening the dematerialization of the art
object.]{.underline}10 The numerous catalogues accompanying his
exhibitions, both during his lifetime and posthumously, have also been
invaluable for the arguments which follow. In addition to the collection
of his essays, we must note the following catalogues for their
unquestionable influence: Robert Smithson, organized by Eugenie Tsai and
Cornelia Butler, MOCA, Los Angeles; Robert Smithson: Sculpture,
organized by Robert Hobbs, Herbert H. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell
University (along with the more comprehensive eponymous text that was
subsequently published by Cornell University Press and edited by
Hobbs)11; Robert Smithson in Vancouver: Fragmentation of a Greater
Fragmentation, edited by Grant Arnold, Vancouver Art Gallery; Robert
Smithson: Mapping Dislocations, organized by Elyse Goldberg, James Cohen
Gallery; and, Robert Smithson: Drawings, organized by Mario Amaya, New
York Cultural Centre. It is with tremendous gratitude and humility that
I admit the present work would have been all but impossible without
reference to these collections. 10 Robert Smithson: The Collected
Writings, edited by Jack Flam (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University
of California Press, 1996). This collection will be henceforth cited in
the text as RSCW with the accompanying page reference. 11 Robert
Smithson: Sculpture, edited by Robert Hobbs (Ithaca and London: Cornell
University Press, 1981); this collection will be henceforth cited in the
text as RSS with the accompanying page reference. 9 Scholarship within
art history has proven no less significant for the present work. Of
particular relevance to my research is Ann Reynolds' Robert Smithson:
Learning from New Jersey and Elsewhere. While Reynolds' appraisal is,
for the most part, disinterested in philosophical questions raised by
the present work, her careful and somewhat idiosyncratic reading of
Smithson's artistic practice is without comparison and informs our
subsequent reading of many of Smithson's works. [Of equal consequence
for the present analysis is Ron Graziani's Robert Smithson and the
American Landscape, which situates Smithson's geological attack on
Modernism within the history of American cultural debates and their
political efficacy.]{.underline} Again, while Graziani's interests in
his study remain somewhat adjacent to our philosophical concerns, **[his
excellent readings of Smithson's works have proven
indispensable.]{.underline}**

### Eroticism

#### Educational and social systems of thought continually suppress the possibility of eroticism vis a vi social linguistic taboo's which create a "language that equals zero".

**Lerman'15 --** Lindsay Lerman -- University of Guelph Philosophy
Department, Graduate Student. Studies Epistemology, Georges Bataille --
"Georges Bataille's "Nonknowledge" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open
Economy of Knowledge" pg 53-55

[Erotism is markedly different because it explicitly addresses
communication as an element of nonknowledge]{.underline}. Erotism
[presents us with]{.underline} two such important moments, both at the
conclusion of the book. The first is Bataille's use of what he calls ["a
**language that equals zero**":]{.underline}

I have cautioned you about language. I must therefore caution you at the
same time against my own words. Not that I want to end upon a note of
farce, but [I have been trying to talk a language that equals zero, a
language equivalent to nothing at all, a language that returns to
silence. I am not talking about nothingness, which sometimes looks to me
like a pretext for adding a specialized chapter onto speech; I am
talking about the suppression of whatever language may add to the
world]{.underline} (264).

The second moment is a refinement of Bataille's earlier claim that
[something "slips" in communication]{.underline}:

\[[L\]**anguage scatters the totality of all that touches us most
closely even while it arranges it in order**. Through language we can
never grasp what matters to us,]{.underline} for it [eludes us in the
form of interdependent propositions]{.underline}, and no central whole
to which each of these can be referred ever appears. Our [attention
remains fixed on this whole but we can never see it in the full light of
day]{.underline}. A succession of propositions flickering off and on
merely hides it from our gaze, and [we are powerless to alter
this]{.underline} (274).

These two [moments highlight a crucial aspect of the communication
element of nonknowledge: language "that equals zero"]{.underline} [is
honest Bataillean communication]{.underline}, but something still eludes
us---something escapes any and all language and thus escapes being
suppressed (in the form of propositions aiming at totality).

Feature 1.3 (of Unstable Communicability): "A language that equals zero"

Our next concern is to understand this phrase: "[a language that equals
zero, a language equivalent to nothing at all, a language that returns
to silence]{.underline}" (ibid 264). Understanding the concept of
erotism will move us toward an explanation of this "language that equals
zero." According to Bataille, "**[erotism is silence]{.underline}**"
(ibid 274[). And it is secret]{.underline}37:

My starting point is that [eroticism is a solitary
activity.]{.underline} At the least it is a matter difficult to discuss.
For not only conventional reasons, [eroticism is defined by secrecy. It
cannot be public]{.underline}. I might instant some exceptions but
somehow eroticism is outside ordinary life. [In our experience taken as
a whole it is cut off from the normal communication of emotions. There
is a taboo in force. Nothing is absolutely forbidden, for there are
always transgressions. But the taboo is sufficiently active for me to be
able to say by and large that eroticism]{.underline}, perhaps the most
intense of emotions, [is as if it did not exist as far as our existence
is present for us in the form of speech and language]{.underline}
\[\...\] [Erotic experience will commit us to silence]{.underline} (ibid
252; emphasis mine).

Bataille is claiming that [erotic experience involves two kinds of
silence. One is the kind of silence that taboo requires]{.underline}.
This is a [socially-required silence. Erotic experience cannot be part
of "normal communication of emotions," lest we risk the social
exclusion]{.underline} resulting from taboo violation. (We are sometimes
even prohibited from speaking of our erotic worlds, as in the case of
codes of professional conduct in some workplaces.) [The other kind of
silence results from erotism being "the most intense of emotions":
erotic experience does not translate into language]{.underline}. It is
as if erotic experience does not exist, "as far as our existence is
present for us in the form of speech and language" (ibid). Th[e erotic
defies our attempts to communicate it, even if we wish to communicate
it, even if we do not fear the repercussions of violating taboos. This
suggests an additional, more challenging claim:]{.underline} there is a
permanent part of our existence characterized by its inability to be
translated into and represented through language. [This part of our
existence, however, can be accessed in erotic experience.]{.underline}

[Erotic language is partially characterized by silence. It is silence,
as Bataille says, but it is more than one kind of silence. It is
socially-sanctioned silence, and it is experientially- necessary
silence. It is a silence required of us on two fronts: the outside world
and the experience]{.underline} (of the erotic) [itself]{.underline}. If
we can say anything of erotic experience, Bataille claims, what [we say
will amount to nothing, as we are only describing a necessary silence.
This is language which "amounts to zero":]{.underline} speech and
[language used to describe silence, and to describe that
which]{.underline} (for Bataille) **[resides in us but outside speech
and language]{.underline}**.

#### The alt is to have erotic transgressions

Batailles Notion of Eroticism)/RF

[The possibility of eroticism,]{.underline} and so of the experience of
Eros, [comes from the structure of existence.]{.underline} According to
Bataille[, life is divided in two realms: the continuous existence and
the discontinuous one.]{.underline} Eros is a phenomenon that happens in
the realm of continuous existence, but depends on the fact that [beings
experiencing erotic love live within the discontinuous
existence.]{.underline} In other words, [eroticism is the disturbance of
the discontinuous existence that brings discontinuous beings into
continuous existence.]{.underline} From the outset, we can see that
**[eroticism is a transgression]{.underline}**--- which will become
associated with evil later. Discontinuous existence is the realm of
isolated beings. In it, entities are limited, and thus have a selfhood,
even a sense of seriousness. Continuous existence, on the other hand, is
the realm in which the Self is no more, in which energies are ever
moving and stability is impossible. The realm of animality; a night in
which separated forms and beings are not, but in which everything is
part of a continuity**[. Eroticism is thus the transgression of the
determined limits of discontinuous beings in order to experience the
violence of continuity.]{.underline}** In order to understand this, we
need to understand the structure of each form of existence that Bataille
describes, and [only through a thorough understanding of]{.underline}
these [structures can we see how they create the possibility of erotic
experiences]{.underline}---and what this phenomenon entails.
**[Continuous existence is not a primitive state, but a chaotic one, in
which stability and rest are not possible.]{.underline}** It is a state
of movement and continuity, closer to what we can call the elemental
than to the world of distinct shapes and beings. According to Bataille,
**[existence is movement, in the sense that it is a flux of energies
that moves around the Earth without purpose. As such, it is a wasteful
process, and expenditure without end.]{.underline}** The movement of
life is a movement of expenditure. It is energetic and exuberant,
because it is a play of forces that strive to affirm themselves through
the overcoming of lesser manifestations. The grass grows out of the
solar energies, the fawn grows out of the grass, the wolf feeds on the
accumulated forces of the fawn's, and so on. Overall, each new level is
a more exuberant display of energies, and each new level asks for more
and more forces to be in play (see Bataille, Part maudite). The wolf
needs to use more energy to hunt the fawn than the grass to accumulate
the energies of the sun to grow. [This continuity entails what Bataille
calls a general economy, one that is not grounded in principle of
accumulation, but on expenditure. In continuity nothing is accumulated
or loss: on the global scale---the general one---the energy circulates
endlessly, without purpose.]{.underline} From the perspective of the
singular and isolated entities, it is a movement of expenditure that
overcomes and destroys them. From the perspective of continuity, it is
existence at its fullest. **[The continuous existence is the one in
which life is immanent]{.underline}**--- and seen as such. For the
predator, the prey is only a source of energy, not an isolated being
apart from it. It is a unique manifestation, in the sense that the fawn
is a concentrated amount of energies with a given shape and in a given
spatiotemporal position, but for any entity in continuity, the fawn
partakes in the same movement of expenditure we call life. [We should
consider continuous existence as a plane of immanence, a plane on which
life manifests itself through level of intensity that are in
communication with each other.]{.underline} In Bataille's terminology,
**[beings are to be considered according to the amount of energy they
represent;]{.underline}** beings are exuberant, because that is the way
in which they can affirm themselves; expenditure as the logic of
continuous existence.1 As we hinted at earlier, expenditure is only one
from the perspective of isolated and discontinuous beings. We see
continuous existence---and existence as such---as a movement of
expenditure because we are used to think under the logic of
preservation, that is through the assumption that life is the life of
the self. 1 We will draw a lot for this distinction between general and
restrained economy on Bataille's most systematic work: La part maudite.
We recommend---obviously---to read the whole work, since it is a
thorough analysis of economy through history. It seems, however, that
the reader could find the essence of our explanation in the first part,
which Bataille calls restrained economy, energies are to be accumulated
for a purpose. Discontinuous beings calculate in order to remain in
their finitude. The surplus of energies are used either as an
augmentation of one's comfort, or as investment in new forms of
accumulation. The surplus is thus always an accursed share, because it
is a remainder---and a reminder---of the fact that life is overflowing,
and not to be contained within limited existences. [Life,]{.underline}
however, [does not take into consideration the desire of preservation.
Its movement---violent and exuberant---is unstoppable, and refuse to be
contained in a single place. This is why the general economy, the one
that looks at continuity and beyond the desire of preservation of the
discontinuous entity, appears as a movement of expenditure: it is
pointless, without any form of calculus, and most of all without any
possibility of accumulation.]{.underline} The discontinuous existence
creates the possibility for stability. It is the realm in which the self
wants to survive and be a center of meaning. It is the world of human
rationality and existence. As such, it is built around the logic of
restrained economy, one that only aims at the preservation of limited
selves. [If from the economic standpoint, it refuses expenditure, the
same will go morally.]{.underline} The surplus to spend is accursed,
excess is evil. In other words, [in the desire for preservation comes
with a distinction between good and evil---good being the preservation
of the self and evil its destruction.]{.underline} "In popular opinion
\[jugement vulgaire\], the substantive aspect of moral action is its
subordination to utility, and the impulses for a yearning to transcend
\[dépasser\] being are related to the good of one's being." (Bataille,
Nietzsche 29**[) Morality is always a desire to go beyond our limits.
The categorical imperative---probably the extreme of moral desire---is
universal, beyond our reach, and dictating us how to act from on
high.]{.underline}** This, however, as any moral that finds its purpose
within a restrained economy, only aims at the preservation of the self.
According to Bataille, it is thus a fallen morality. [The true moral
impulse]{.underline}---what he phrases "morale du sommet" is [not aimed
at preservation, but at communication]{.underline}, that is to say, at
continuity. In other words, the morale du sommet is transgressive of the
self, but most of all evil. "All 'communication' participates in
suicide, in crime. ... By destroying the integrity of existence in
myself and in others, I open myself to communion---I attain a moral
summit." (26) With restrained economy comes the morality that
establishes good as the good of a limited being. In both cases, the goal
is to restrain the chaotic energies in order to accumulate and
calculate. It is a rejection of expenditure. Taboos and moral rules will
always do violence to the continuous movement of expenditure.
[Expenditure is considered violent and evil, because it is without
purpose, but Bataille stresses out how taboos and restrictions are other
ways to justify our own inner violence---that we have because life as
such is violent.]{.underline} "If my life is threatened for some
comprehensible good--- for instance, for the nation of a useful
cause---my behavior is deserving - 38 - PhænEx and is popularly
considered moral. **[And for the same reasons I'll kill and wreck havoc
in conformity to moral law.]{.underline}** I another area, squandering
resources through gambling and drinking is wrong: though it's right to
improve the fate of the poor." (28) The morality that comes with
discontinuous existence is an attempt to give a purpose to expenditure
and the movement of energies: it tries to restrain by making
calculable**[. As long as we conceive existence as taking place within
the restrained economy, good will always be related to a form of
preservation, whereas evil will be a wasteful movement of
expenditure.]{.underline}**

#### Eroticism allows for the dissolution of a stable self -- it is an encounter with death that views it not as a biological process but as being of the realm of the impossible which enables an embrace of excess 

**Minguy, 17** (Thomas Minguy, Head of marketing and communication at
ARTKeoS Paris 01, Île-de-France, FranceInformation Technology and
Services, ARTKeoS Digital Advisor

Previous Masterbrand, Historycraft.fr, Caisse D Allocations Familiale,
Erotic Exuberance: Batailles Notion of Eroticism)/RF

**[This is where the erotic makes its appearance.]{.underline}** We
already hinted at the fact that [eroticism is the transgression of
discontinuous existence so human beings can go back to a state of
continuity.]{.underline} We should then see how **[eroticism is related
to Bataillean communication, which is, as we saw, a form of
evil.]{.underline}** Even further: it is the possibility of human
sovereignty. By that term, we need to understand not a state of mastery,
but an escape from the logic of mastery and work.
[Sovereignty,]{.underline} in Bataille's philosophy, [is deeply evil,
because it is a transgression of what limits and constrains
us.]{.underline} [Eroticism differs from sexuality in the sense that
through a desire for communication, the lovers are not driven by a logic
of satisfaction---which would preserve their selves---but on a logic of
continuity.]{.underline} This is a tension in Bataille's thought since
it still seems that such a desire would ask for a form of calculation
and thus would fall under the logic of restrained economy. What is truly
at stake here, however, is to understand the relation between eroticism
and evil, leading us to sovereignty, and its distinction from mere
sexuality, which is oriented towards the future hope for satisfaction.
Seriousness is the state of being in which there is stability and the
possibility of preservation: it is the "end" of violence and
exuberance[**. The serious self can consider herself as the subject that
look objectively at the world**. It is the self that refuses to be
thrown into existence, but that strives to master and work within
it---through physical or intellectual means.]{.underline} The serious
existence entailed by work comes with a projective mode of existence,
and thus with a linear temporality. The self from the past, the one in
the present and the one of the future are all the same selfhood that
develops itself, but stays within a limited existence[. In the violence
of transgression]{.underline}---or of communication, what appears is the
fact that **[life is a play of energies, a play that cannot allow
seriousness.]{.underline}** What appears is the plane of immanence, that
is a plane that does not allow projects, but an intense immersion in
expenditure. It is an experience of existence as such, i.e. a pure
experience of what it means to be. [Seriousness is thus necessarily
anxious]{.underline}, because, as Bataille says it, [the serious and
working self of discontinuous existence is always conscious of a
violence that still lingers within life as such]{.underline}, a violence
that could bring projects, hopes and dreams to naught; a violence that
could disturb the calm atmosphere of a stable life. In the creative
impulses of work, [what appears is the destructive possibility of
creativity;]{.underline} and in the violence of passions and desires
what appear is the dissolution of a selfhood, and the loss of
seriousness. Eros appears in Bataillean thought to be the possibility of
a being that wants to overflow, and to breaks out of the restricted
seriousness. It is the explosion of selfhood. [Eroticism is the "fall"
of the working and serious self into the continuous and exuberant
communication.]{.underline} In a certain sense, **[eroticism is an
attempt to be in a state of innocence: a state in which the serious self
is not anxious nor at stake with a world that must remain stable, but in
a state where the self is destroyed and in continuity with the loved
one.]{.underline}** Isolate being is a deception (which reflects the
crowd's distress by reversing it), and the couple, becoming stable at
last, is a negation of love. But what goes from one lover to the other
is a movement that puts an end to isolation or at least makes it waver.
Isolate being is risked, opens to what's beyond itself, to what's beyond
the couple even -monstrous excess. (Guilty 158) The logic of Eros is
thus the breaking apart of the stable and serious existence, and the
embrace of continuous existence. [It is the death of the isolated self
and the birth of a communication that does not take place in a
discontinuous world.]{.underline} It is the transgression of the limits
that are necessary to the stable and serious existence, and thus it is
an aspect of human existence that is utterly exuberant and non-rational,
in the sense that it cannot be understood under the logic of work and
seriousness. [**Eroticism is an experience of life in all its intensity
and exuberance: it is the death of the isolated self that suddenly finds
itself in the midst of life's orgy,**]{.underline} that is in the midst
of the play of energies that existence is. **[Death, here, is not a
biological ending of function, but the movement that breaks the limited
existence. Death is the experience of the beyond the limits---an
experience of the impossible.]{.underline}** "A request you ought to
make to your boyfriend or girlfriend: be the victim of the impossible."
(40) Far from being the desire to own the other, [what erotic love
craves is the experience of the impossible,]{.underline} that is the
experience of existence in its violence and exuberance, where
possibility, as in the logic of seriousness, is impossible. This is
equivalent to death, since it is, in a way, an experience of
nothingness. Serious existence dwells within the possible, that is
within the possibility to calculate and use entities within a desire for
preservation. [What is deemed impossible is what escape that logic, so
in a sense everything that will be labeled evil, wasteful and announcing
death.]{.underline} We already saw that Bataille, in On Nietzsche, says
that "squandering" and "drinking" are reprehensible, whereas killing in
the name of a greater good - 41 - Thomas Minguy is deemed good: in the
former case, it is because it leads nowhere and is a [form of loss and
perdition; in the latter there is a certain calculation and a purpose.
Eroticism opposes sexuality in the same way]{.underline}: the former is
wasteful, without purpose and transgressive of selfhood; the latter is a
craving for being filled with pleasure. S**[uch a logic then takes part
into the movement of transgression and death, in the sense that what is
sought is the transgression of limits, and thus the death of selfhood.
Escaping the possibility of satisfaction and embracing the excess of
energies; sacrificing the limited selfhood to find the continuity of
existence.]{.underline}**

[In the dichotomy between continuous and discontinuous existence, what
is at play is the stability of self-consciousness, and thus of
selfhood.]{.underline} Philosophical tradition often considered the
problem of subjectivity objectivity through the lenses of a dichotomy
between the subject and the external world in which it is thrown. It is
the easiest way to conceive discontinuous existence, because **[if the
subject is separated from the objects, there is no continuity but a
world made of specific entities that only a separated and isolated self
can know.]{.underline}** Cartesian thought creates that dichotomy, as
Descartes tries to escape the blurred senses to understand the world in
clear and distinct ideas. [This is even his criteria of truth: clarity
and distinction.]{.underline} With Hegel, and subsequent developments in
phenomenology, what appears is that the subjective must collapse with
the objective, and thus [the philosophical analysis of the development
of selfconsciousness becomes the main task of philosophy.]{.underline}
This task is, according to Bataille, the creation of a solidified self
that is enclosed within determinate limits. In Levinas' vocabulary,
[philosophy of such a tradition creates a totality that cuts itself from
the infinite, in the sense that self-consciousness as subject and object
of itself can only look at the universe as something
limited]{.underline}---that can expand through Hegelian dialectic, for
example, but that remains ultimately limited, i.e. looking at itself.
Discontinuous existence, as we saw, is exactly that: the creation of a
limited self that can only look at other objects through a limited
vision. Quiddity, essence, categories: all of these are way to maintain
the world within a limited self-consciousness. [Immanence and continuous
energies must be shaped to become meaningful]{.underline}---e.g. the
overcoming of sense certainty is the beginning of Hegelian development
of self-consciousness, which leads to World Spirit, [the ultimate
expression of a universal selfconsciousness, the ultimate totality.
Disturbances of discontinuous existence are moments in which the
seriousness of the stable selfhood is broken. **Eroticism is such a
disturbance.**]{.underline} What appears in eroticism is the vision that
**[the limited self is not everything, and that it is a manifestation of
energies]{.underline}**---chaotic and exuberant energies. In the
shattering of the self, what is visible is the flux of energies, the
exuberance of living beings. [Being in continuity does not mean being
lost without any possibility of differentiation. It means seeing the
world as made up of energies, and ourselves being a unique manifestation
of energies.]{.underline} Your business is questing for an unknowable
destiny. Because of this you'll have to struggle by hating
limits---limits which the system of respectability sets up against
freedom. On account of this, you'll need to arm yourself with secret
pride and indomitable willpower. [**The advantages given to you by
chance**---your beauty, glamour, and the untamed impulsiveness of your
life---**are required for your laceration.**]{.underline} (Guilty 161)
[The uniqueness of the loved one is ephemeral, and its only truth is its
oncoming death]{.underline}. The limits, Bataille says, [are there to be
overcome and destroyed]{.underline}, because as limits they contain the
energies that we are. The loved one, with her unique beauty, arouse our
lust and desire: we desire this unique manifestation of energy. **[We
desire to unleash the energies that are hidden under the veil of a
limited self---]{.underline}**under the veil or her unique selfhood.
**["Eroticism is]{.underline}** not satisfied in contentment; it is
**[the release of excess forces, craving extreme experiences in extreme
torments and extreme pleasures."]{.underline}** (Lingis, Dangerous 141)
In that sense, [eroticism is a transgressive movement:]{.underline} the
transgression of selfhood **[in a desire to unleash
energies]{.underline}**. This unleashing is communication, in the sense
that through the transgression of limits we gain access to what is
utterly inaccessible to limited selves[. Through an experience akin to
death---in an experience that goes beyond limits---we experience
continuous existence, in which every entity is in communication with
others.]{.underline} It is an extreme movement that seeks to make
visible the energies of the world and the excessive movement of life.
The serious self stands proud above the ground, and it keeps a physical
image that seems solid and organized. It is the body of an organism,
something with a hierarchy and an organisation that makes sense (see
Deleuze & Guattari). The hands are there to hold and shape, the head to
think and see, the mouth to talk and all together the brain controls the
movement of our bodies with purposes. Through erotic impulses such a
vision is shattered[. In the erotic moment, what is sought is
expenditure--- free expenditure of excessive energies that are not
related to any notion of utility.]{.underline} "An erotic object
functions as the open gate toward which the shock waves of our energies
rush to be compressed and intensified and inflamed there, and to break
forth into the dazzling darkness beyond." (Lingis, Dangerous 143) Eros
is thus not a desire to possess, but to unleash. **[The object of erotic
desire thus becomes a site of transgression: it is the sacrifice of its
usefulness.]{.underline}** In other words, **[eroticism is the movement
in which what has the character of seriousness is brought down in
obscenity.]{.underline}** This is on this basis that it differentiates
itself from mere sexuality. **[Sexuality is always linked with a
transgression of selfhood,]{.underline}** in the fact that reproduction
of two separated beings asks for their oncoming death. "The parents
survive the birth of their offspring but the reprieve is only temporary.
... [Death follows reproduction with sexual beings too, at a distance
even if not immediately."]{.underline} (Bataille, Erotism 100-1**[)
Thus, reproduction is a transgression of selfhood, in the sense that it
is the vision of the future death of the parents:]{.underline}** it is
the annunciation of the end of a limited being through the apparition of
another limited being. Even more so, [sexuality]{.underline}, in a
physical sense, [is a transgression of one's body.]{.underline} Through
sensual caresses and different penetrations, one's body is transgressed.
With sexuality particularly a sense of the existence o the others beyond
the self-feeling suggests a possible continuity as opposed to the
original discontinuity. Other individuals, in sexuality, are continually
putting forward the possibility of continuity; others are continually
threatening a rent in the seamless garment of separate individuality.
(102) [Through penetration and sexual acts, the self of the other is no
more separated, but enters into a physical continuity.]{.underline} Even
then, there is a futural aspect in sexuality, and even more a logic of
satisfaction it the structure of desire. One can look at how Freud, in
Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality will subsume sexual drives under
the pleasure principle. Drives create erogenous zones under a logic of
lack and satisfaction: ["The sexual aim of the infantile drive consists
in obtaining satisfaction by means of an appropriate stimulation of the
erogenous zone that has been selected in one way or the
other."]{.underline} (Freud, Three Essays 45) Under that logic,
**[sexuality]{.underline}**---and sexual desire that is too often taken
as Eros---**[is always seeking to fill a hole (often quite literally) in
the limited self.]{.underline}** Sexuality is thus always a calculative
process of lack, satisfaction and pleasure. Eroticism is different, in
the sense that Eros is a desire for continuity, for exceeding limits and
overflowing. [The sensual touch becomes erotic when there is violation
of the person of another. There is a breaking down of someone's public
and decent presence and functioning]{.underline} in the ordered and
regulated roles of the social field. There is a specific excitement in
the collapse of posture and wariness, the divestment of functions,
roles, and selfrespect. (Lingis, Violence 82) - 44 - PhænEx Eros is not
the desires for satisfaction of the self, but for the breaking apart of
limits. Eros is the desire to lose oneself in the chaotic energies of
life. "The physical urge is curiously foreign to human life, loosed
without reference to it so long as it remains silent and keeps away. The
being yielding to that urge is human no longer but, like the beasts, a
prey of blind forces in action, wallowing in blindness and oblivion."
(Bataille, Erotism 105) **[Erotic pleasure is the liberation of the
violence that lingers in human beings, the violence of life that is
repressed and crystallized in seriousness through taboos and moral
restrictions.]{.underline}** Christian religion, for example, condemn
Eros and prefers Philia, and by far Agape. Eros is considered as a
possessive and egotistic desire, where Agape is free giving; but for
Bataille Eros corresponds with a lost of the self, and so it cannot be
egotistic. It is indeed related to the uniqueness of a selfhood, but
only to break that selfhood. To those who avidly desire laceration,
**[individuality is necessary.]{.underline}** Laceration wouldn't be
itself if not a laceration of a particular person, a person chosen for
his or her plentitude. Excess life, fullness, are a means of
highlighting the void, and this fullness and this excess are that
person's to the extent that they dissolve us, taking away the safety
rail that separates us from the void. (Guilty 157[) The fact that this
unique being, in its given beauty and uniqueness is a unique
manifestation of life makes even more explicit the aspect of chance and
absurdity that rules our existences: it makes explicit the constant
movement of energies around the Earth that are chaotic and
nonlogical.]{.underline} The uniqueness of the lover shows that it is
impossible to possess such a being, because the life of such a unique
person is an ephemeral manifestation in an energetic life. And this life
will kill her. When Bataille talks about this "torn" aspect of limited
beings, he means that **[our discontinuous life always comes with the
sense of a continuity that we strive to escape: we tear ourselves out of
the continuous existence. In eroticism, what happens is that we seek the
place where we were torn apart, and we connect through these open
wounds.]{.underline}** "When love denies limited existences, it gives
them in return an infinity of emptiness. It limits them to waiting for
what they are not." (154) [Erotic love is the negation of limits, the
transgression of seriousness and the openness to the emptiness of what
lies beyond our limits: the emptiness of a meaningless chaos of
energies. **Eroticism thus escapes the logic of truth.** Truth can only
appear---or be understood---in a world where it is possible to stabilize
objects and to look at them.]{.underline} Even in the possibility of a
fluid truth, as in Hegelian dialectic, truth depends on the certain
stability of a given stage of the dialectic. "The True is thus the
Bacchanalian revel in which no member is not drunk; yet because each
member collapses as soon as he drops out, the revel is just as much
transparent and simple repose." (Hegel 27) With such an account, what
appears is that truth is fluid and changes over time, but the members of
the bacchanalian revel collapses, and the "transparent and simple
repose" is the vision of its development over time, and thus the
possibility of grasping truth. **[In erotic contact, the coherent lines
of discourse break up into teasing, nonsense, and
laughter.]{.underline}** Erotic contact disconnects from the rational
language that seeks to establish truth, that is, what is true for
everyone; erotic utterances are a private language. Nothing is to be
learned from listening in to lover's talk. (Lingis, Violence 84) There
is no purpose in the erotic pleasure, because what is sought is not
satisfaction nor reproduction, but loss and abandonment. [It is, as we
said earlier, giving oneself to the violence of life, and embracing the
chaotic movements of energies that are around the globe.]{.underline} It
is leaving the inertia of a serious life and embracing the high velocity
of energies circling the world. [As such, eroticism thus leaves the
realm in which truth is possible to understand, and seeks to experience
the truth of existence]{.underline}, i.e. its violence and exuberance.
Leaving the logic of understanding (of grasping the truth), it enters
logic of immanence, in which truth is not seized, but created and
experienced. Through eroticism, what appears is the breakdown of
seriousness and the openness to the death of limitations. [When there
are no limits, objects are no more graspable: they become fluid and
their truth is no more something we can hold, but that we must create
with.]{.underline} When we kiss the lips of our lovers, these lips
cannot do their role: they cannot eat nor talk, they can only enrapture
us in this excess of energies. Same when we make love to our lovers: in
the taking away of the clothes of the other, what appears is the frailty
and vulnerability of a body that is no more able to walk proudly on
Earth. In the erotic activity [we lose control over our limbs and we
collapse in numerous ecstasies that cannot be associated with utility,
and in a certain sense we die in the arms of our lover, because we are
no more this serious self that was limited. We embrace what lies beyond
the limits of our selves, and such a limit is beyond the grasp of our
reason, because it is nonsensical.]{.underline} The caressing hands move
aimlessly over the flesh in random, repetitious movements. The muscles
tighten, harden, the limbs grope and grapple, pistons and rods of a
machine that has no idea what it is trying to achieve. The it collapses,
gelatinizes, melts, runs. The trapped blood surges and pounds, the heat
billows, the spirit vaporizes in gasps and sighs. [In dissolute ecstasy
the body that has become ligneous, ferric, coral now curdles, dissolves,
liquefies, vaporizes, becomes radioactive, solar,
nocturnal.]{.underline} (Lingis, Dangerous 148) - 46 - PhænEx The body
loses its posture as the mind loses its grip over the world.
**[Eroticism is when we embrace life in its fullest manifestation,
through the continuity with an other]{.underline}**. It is as simple as
in Bataille's Histoire de l'oeil, in which one of the first erotic
moment is when a young girl sits in a plate, because she says that
plates exist so we can sit in them.2 [In this ridiculous breaking of
seriousness and stability, the young boy experiences an orgasm that
happens only because the plate is no more a plate, but suddenly an gate
to the excessive energies of the world. Breaking the serious stability
of the plate is childish, and laughable---and hardly erotic for many
people;]{.underline} but what is the difference between this and the
crossdressing or even sexual activities in which the mouth it no more
used to eat or talk, but to suck, swallow, bite, moan, laugh, and
scream? **[The costume of the erotic partner is only there to be taken
out of the realm of objects, and to be sacrificed on the altar of
laughter.]{.underline}** The transgression of eroticism is not only a
breaking of a taboo: it is rendering what is deemed serious obscene**[.
In Bataille's erotica, the movement is not one of mere sexuality in
which individuals are copulating for the sake of
pleasure.]{.underline}** The transgression is a transformation of what
is deemed serious and useful into something laughable and devoid of any
use. It is an embrace of evilness. This also explains Bataille's
fascination for writers who are fascinated with evil as an experience of
freedom: Brontë, Blake, Sade, Baudelaire, Genet, etc. [Eroticism differs
from sexuality in the absence of purpose, but mostly in the reversal of
values, the unleashing of energies that are covered by calculative
reasoning and the logic of lack and satisfaction.]{.underline} The zone
of decomposition of the world of work and reason, this zone of blood and
semen and vaginal secretions, of excremental discharges and corpses,
this zone too of mushrooming eddies of nameless inhuman life, which
fills us with exultant anguish and anguished exultation, is the zone of
the sacred. ... **[The sphere of sexuality becomes the zone of the
sacred, where the world of work enters into decomposition, in the
transports of eroticism.]{.underline}** (149) This is where eroticism
leads us when we follow Bataille's logic of transgression: **[we fall
into the sacred realm, and as such eroticism embraces the logic of
sacredness.]{.underline}** Transgression of seriousness is a sacrifice
of the former, and it liberates forces that are hidden in the
crystallized authoritative and meaningful faces. Eros is a desire for
what 2 "'Milk is for the pussy, isn't it?' said Simone. 'Do you dare me
to sit in the saucer?' ... The day was extremely hot. Simone put the
saucer on a small bench, planted herself before me, and, with her eyes
fixed on me, she sat down without my being able to see her burning
buttocks under the skirt, dipping into cool milk. The blood shot to my
head, and I stood before her awhile, immobile and trembling, as she eyed
my stiff cock bulging in my trousers. Then I lay down at her feet
without her stirring, and for the first time, I saw her 'pink and dark'
flesh cooling in the white milk. We remained motionless, both of us
equally overwhelmed...." (Bataille, Story 10) lies beyond the limits of
discontinuous beings, and this beyond corresponds with what we call the
sacred. **[The final step we need to take on Bataille's philosophy of
eroticism is the analysis of what it means to be a saint in Bataillean
terms---of what it means to be sovereign.]{.underline}**

If the final step in our analysis of [eroticism leads into an
exploration of the notion of sacredness and holiness]{.underline}, it is
because the place where erotic desires and actions take us lies within
the same realm of existence. [Eroticism is the breakthrough of
continuous existence in the seriousness of the discontinuous one, and
the sacred is the continuous realm]{.underline}, i.e. a realm of
violence and eternity. [Continuous existence is immortal]{.underline},
in the sense that it cannot die: it is a flux of energies circling
around the world, and in that sense this flux never ends. **[The
particular beings that are part of this continuous cycle are indeed
dying, but their death takes part into the whole cycle.]{.underline}**
The death of the fawn is also the growth of the wolf. [What death
reveals is the violence of continuous existence, and it is only possible
through the end of discontinuous existence,]{.underline} as the violence
of the sea can only be truly experienced in the shattering of the boat
on which the mariner stands. "Blindfolded, we refuse to see that only
death guarantees the fresh upsurging without which life would be blind.
[We refuse to see that life is the trap set for the balanced order, that
life is nothing but instability and disequilibrium.]{.underline} Life is
a swelling tumult continuously on the verge of explosion." (Bataille,
Erotism 59) [Eroticism has a sense of death, because it makes us
experience continuity through the death of our selfhood, through an
experience of what is beyond the restricted vision of the restrained
economy.]{.underline} Sacredness and holiness partake in the same logic:
in the sacred ritual, what happens is that the selfhood dies to meet the
divine, i.e. the violent and exuberant energy that is considered life.
God is love and God is life; and in the sacred texts of Judeo-Christian
religions, what appears most often is the fact that the believer should
abandon selfishness and embrace an openness to the glory of the divine.
This, however, is still, according to Bataille, within the logic of
seriousness and discontinuity, since God becomes the One discontinuous
entity that masters the world, and the believer desires salvation for
her own discontinuous soul. Without delving too much in these problems
that are beyond the purposes of this paper[, one must understand that
the problem of religion is the rational aspect of it,]{.underline} i.e.
the concentration of exuberance into stable divine entities that master
the movement of the elements. **[Religion coincides with the dream of a
pure rational principle that orders the world. What eroticism and
sacredness have in common is not the belief in salvation or in the
immortality of the soul,]{.underline}** but the experience of the
continuity of the world as a manifestation of violent and exuberant
energies. "For every thing that lives is Holy" (Blake 45). This is the
vision that is associated with mysticism, and as such mysticism and
eroticism share a similar structure: in the vision of objects that are
part of the discontinuous existence, the mystic and the erotic person
see a gate towards continuous existence. Mysticism reveals the divine in
a negative way: through the negative theology, it is possible for the
mystic to perceive holiness in the absence of objects. God, in that
sense, is a presence that is similar to an absence: it is the continuity
without discontinuity; being without any distinction, pure exuberance
and movement. "Nothingness: the beyond of limited being. Strickly
speaking, nothingness is what limited being isn't. You could say it's an
absence, an absence of limit. Taken from another point of view:
**[nothingness is what limited being desires, desire having for its
object something that isn't doing the desiring.]{.underline}**"
(Bataille, Guilty 157) [Mysticism is]{.underline} thus [deeply
erotic,]{.underline} since the desire is not a desire of possession nor
a desire to give, but a desire to be lost in what lies beyond one's
limited being. The great mystics embrace what they call the night of
knowledge, and often they will talk about the divine in a way that lies
beyond language. In fact, their relation to God or gods is one that lies
in a pure experience of continuous existence, a rapture that takes them
beyond any possible language or rational explanation. Dante's final
Canto in Paradiso is a beautiful account of that experience: [God is an
absence of objects, an absence of sense and a pure movement of energies
that silences forever the possibility of describing Him.]{.underline}
The experience of the sacred, the experience of the continuous existence
that is the truth of religious life, is thus to be understood under the
logic of Eros. "There is the beauty the Platonic eros contemplates, that
eros that seeks immortal forms. ... The eros that chases after this kind
of beauty is pursuing visions of immortality." (Lingis, Dangerous 143-4)
Even in the Platonic sense, what is sought by Eros is immortality, and
such a thing is only possible through the absence of material objects.
The ladder of Eros, in Symposium, follows that logic: if the lover loves
at first the beautiful objects, it is only to love, in the end, the
eternal forms of these objects. Sacrificing the unique (isolated and
limited) beauty to unleash what cannot die. [Erotic love]{.underline},
however, [is]{.underline} still [subsumed under a vision of
work]{.underline}, in the sense that what is immortal are forms that are
perfect and stable---eternal in the sense that their crystallized
perfect forms cannot die. Once more the dream of perceiving the world
under pure rational principles. The difference between eroticism and
mysticism lies in the fact that where the latter seeks in the absence of
objects the presence of the divine---of this entity that masters the
elements, **[eroticism seeks the absence properly---the absence of
sense.]{.underline}** Mysticism finds sense in the night of reason,
where eroticism experiences the absurdity of chance. The unique person
in front of us, the uniqueness of the lover and the mortality - 49 -
Thomas Minguy of this lover opens up the possibility of seeing
continuous existence. In the transgression of this unique person, in the
transgression this person that is a chance, what is revealed is the
truth of existence: the impossibility to make sense of our own
existence, since we are all part of this exuberant movement of energies.
**[In the erotic moment, what is sacrificed is the apparent necessity of
our selfhood. In the transgression of selfhood, the chance that rules
the world appears, and there is no god, no destiny, no fate, but only
this impossible moment with this impossible person.]{.underline}** When
we quoted earlier Bataille saying that what we need from our lover is
that she becomes the victim of the impossible, this is exactly it: [we
need to discover in the erotic love for our lover the impossibility of
serious existence and of stability. In]{.underline} the melting away of
seriousness and stability, what is revealed is the impossibility of an
answer for our existence, because in this exuberant continuous
existence, only chance rules. This is what Bataille calls sovereignty,
and what he calls sanctity. In tension with his own thought, it appears
to be a form of salvation---on that is experience through an experience
of evil. This is probably the biggest tension at play in Bataille's
work: the line between the saint, the mystic and the erotic is very
thin. Does Bataille really escape calculative reason by changing from a
restrained to a general perspective? Is not sovereignty through evil a
distorted form of salvation? If Bataille claims that the true erotic and
sovereign experience depends on a chance---almost an experience of evil
"grace"---it seems hard to conciliate with his appeal to transgression
and numerous attempts to create, throughout his personal life,
ritualistic secret societies. This is a problem left unsolved by
Bataille---and it could be the task of those who read him to explore
this issue of chance, that takes all the place in very aporetic works,
such as On Nietzsche or Guilty. The saint lives above the contingencies
of the world, and consider each thing holy, since each thing is a
manifestation of life and also a product of chance. "The
autonomy---sovereignty---of man is linked to the fact of his being a
question with no answer." (Bataille, Guilty 133) Embracing immanence,
the saint will live in the world above the rules and will defy rational
and limited possibilities. [**Death of subjectivity and objectivity;**
immanence of the creator that plays with the energies of the world,
knowing that life is a play of forces and chances: only with the
innocence of the child can we truly embrace this reality.]{.underline}
Lack of seriousness and deep love for the world; desire of what lies
beyond our limits as limited being; an embrace of the energies of life.
[The saint and the sovereign one are both above the rules and
contingencies, because they do not live only in the discontinuous
world]{.underline}: their task is to bring continuity in the
discontinuous world, to do "miracles," i.e. to break the apparent order
of things---even to transgress the apparent moral order. Opening up the
world as a plane of immanence, and thus refusing to see things as
crystallized, but always as fluid and immanent. Sovereignty as the state
of innocence, in which the laughter of the child makes the world
transparent and holy. Conclusion: Eros as an Experience of Existence
Eros---or [erotic love]{.underline}---[is the gate towards
sovereignty,]{.underline} because it is a gate towards continuous
existence. [The embrace of the flux of energies, of exuberant forces
that cannot be totally controlled or subsumed under rational and moral
principles, is the truth of eroticism.]{.underline} The truth of Eros is
the secret, the mute and evil rumble of chaotic existence. Lovers meet
at night under a tree in a forest, because that is the secret of love:
the secretive movement, that can never stop. It is the movement of
expenditure without a purpose other than existing as an us. [Loving like
a wave loves another one, loving as in a dream that will end, but that
is unique, because it is mine---and yours, and ours. Being secret,
always moving. We are a secret---not because nobody knows, but because
nobody can be part of our movement, of our deep experience of the
world.]{.underline} That is how we started too: as secret lovers,
partner in crime. Complicité, complicity: intimacy in something that
must remain secret. Conceived under this logic, [what the sovereign one
sees is exactly what the saint seeks to show:]{.underline} the secret of
the world, the fact that everything is divine and immanent. Being
secretive is going against the rules, going against the determined
limits that tells one what to do or not to do. Playing with serious
figures and forms of authority, Eros creates a space in which things are
secretive, because they cannot be voiced out loud. In Bataille's Story
of the Eye, children are the protagonists, and their erotic relationship
unfolds through secrets and secretive actions. Hidden, or alone: never
in public, and more than anything else, never with the thought of
utility or satisfaction. A mere game that goes nowhere, but that can
only accept players sharing the secretive life of the three children.
When they are caught, parents are horrified, because that is also part
of what it means to be secretive: horrifying figures of authority and
seriousness. **[Being erotic]{.underline}**---embracing erotic
love---**[does not mean being in a sexual intimacy with someone: it
means being in a state of complicity that brings both lovers out of the
realm of seriousness.]{.underline}** It brings them back to state of
immanence, where what is disclosed is the possibility of creating with
the energies of life. [The secret is a disturbance of stable
life,]{.underline} because it must always move. As we saw, it means that
it is living in the continuous existence, and as such it must follow the
movement of life. [Eros creates the possibility for fluidity: it is the
desire of what lies within the limited self. When we said that erotic
desire is a desire of lies beyond the limits, we meant that it is a
desire of what lies beyond limited entities.]{.underline} "Beyond," not
in an external sense, but in an intensive sense. What lies beyond
limitations is exuberant energies, and this is always within limited
beings. **[What lies beyond the limits is existence in its violence and
nonrational aspect: it is the night in which we must immerse ourselves
to feel part of the world.]{.underline}** It is the ecstasy of the saint
that feels the divine within her. It is the sovereign feeling when a
lover gazes in his lover's eyes. In that sense, the secret, the
experience of life through Eros is an experience of violence and
exuberance that takes us away from our selfhoods. **[It is something
transgressive, but in this transgression what is sought is not
satisfaction, but immanence.]{.underline}** A phenomenology of Eros,
then, would have to study the logic of transgression in its relation
with immanence. It would look not at a history of sexuality, but at the
history of taboos and their ultimate breaking apart. It would study the
sacred aspect of different societies, and how figures of authority took
control of sacredness to create an institution---a set of dogmas that
are limiting the scope of the sacred. Ultimately, what this study would
show is the movement of secret societies and how the secretive aspect of
eroticism corresponds to the immanence of life. **[Bataille's study of
eroticism creates the possibility to see the desire of what lies beyond
not under transcendental or external terms,]{.underline}** but as **[a
desire of letting the exuberance of life shining forth through the fall
of seriousness.]{.underline}** In that sense, Bataille's Eros is closer
to Spinoza's conatus or Nietzsche's will to power[: it is a desire to
be.]{.underline} Eros as the desire of pure existence, and not as the
experience of the ineffable. **[Eroticism thus becomes not only an
important aspect of human existence,]{.underline}** but the possibility
of a sovereign existence that would escape the contingencies created by
the logic of work[. It becomes the possibility for a continuous
relationship with other human beings and the world.]{.underline} Eros is
not pure immanence, but the desire to unleash immanence. **[Erotic is
the gaze of the loved one, the caress of a lover, and the laughter of a
child: erotic because they unleash forces that melt away our
selfhood.]{.underline}**

### **[Failure]{.underline}**

#### **Thus we affirm ourselves as the failures of education -- resisting the dominant power formations as an act of nihilism towards the educational systems of subject formation which resist the barbaric forms of western ideals and instead watch the corpse of education fade away as we laugh at its rotting figure.**

**Allen'16 --** Ansgar Allen is lecturer in education at the University
of Sheffield, "Education, Mastery and the Marquis de Sade" \--

Sade's direction of travel is also our own, insofar as [we too are
suffering the effects of "European nihilism]{.underline}."lxix But our
collec[tive travel is less deliberate: we kill Man, God and Nature
without fully intending to. This killing of each is built into the
pursuit of mastery]{.underline} that we (unlike Sade) disavow. [Sade
only brings to the surface that brutalism inherent in Western education,
which negates and negates monstrously, in order to affirm]{.underline}.
It is perhaps conceivable that, if this tendency were fully
acknowledged, [if the grotesque nature of our dream, our pursuit of
mastery were fully manifested, we might develop the strength to reject
it as our educational objective;]{.underline} and [not by returning to
that dirty compromise of mastery through enslavement which kills though
it does so quietly; rather we might pursue its opposite, which is
failure, a failure to master others and ourselves.]{.underline}

[Mastery or failure, these are the options given us by education.
Mastery is promised through a sleight of hand that prevents its
delivery]{.underline} (we become enslaved to the pursuit of something
that is rarely if ever realised), [whilst failure of a kind is
guaranteed.]{.underline} Educational [failure is far more common and
systematically produced than we would like to admit]{.underline}. In
short, if [one did not fail, another would not succeed; the mastery of
those who succeed is dependent on the existence of those multitudes that
fail]{.underline}. We are in a position similar to that of the debauched
libertine still [reliant on the "pleasure of
comparison]{.underline}"---[educational success remains dependent on
educational failure]{.underline}, on negation (and educational failure
remains dependent by comparison with educational success). [We are not
simply waiting for the "right" pedagogy to be applied "successfully" so
that failure can be removed]{.underline}.lxx Described as the "traumatic
real" of contemporary education, [failure belies the barbarism of
educational mastery and the fantasy of an educational
good.]{.underline}lxxi In a perverse cycle of affirmation, [education is
offered as the solution to the problem]{.underline}, that of systemic
[failure, which education creates. Failure is the necessary consequence
of that nihilism which attaches us to promises that are never
delivered]{.underline}, which makes us its inevitable disappointments.
The [educated nihilist would not retreat from failure,
then]{.underline}. This figu[re would not seek to heal education of that
affliction, since failure constitutes education. Yet even for the
educated nihilist this is difficult to fully admit: It really is
traumatic for the educator who is by profession wedded to an ideology of
educational success.]{.underline}

Our [options are limited by our histories and appear radically opposed.
We might affirm mastery and redefine it]{.underline} as Sade once did
[so that our mastery is no longer dependant on the failure of others. Or
we might pursue its opposite, failure]{.underline}. This, too, [might
constitute a route through nihilism]{.underline}. Accordingly [we would
embrace failure, learning to fail better]{.underline}. We [would seek to
fail without appeal, attempting to fail on our own terms]{.underline}.
Our [failures would fall outside the shadow of a promised
mastery]{.underline}. This [affirmation of failure would raise the
devil,]{.underline} that "Spirit of Heaviness" through which "[all
things fall]{.underline}."lxxii It would give homage to that
metaphysical ghost which nihilism both produces and suffers. It would
confront that spirit in its incorruptible substance, and [understand how
it was first and forever since conjured by man]{.underline}. Having
nothing in common with matter, this Spirit of Heaviness leaves us with
the sensation of falling. We are confronted by things that will no
longer be suspended aloft. [These things fall, we fall with them, and in
our descent we begin to accomplish our nihilism]{.underline}.lxxiii This
[fallout we perceive as the necessary outcome of that unnecessary belief
in spectral things, ideas, Gods.]{.underline}

[Our affirmation of failure would be deliberate, giving expression to
our nihilism]{.underline}, revealing its [downward tendencies so they
are better negotiated.]{.underline} We would no longer kill Man, God and
Nature without fully intending to. Rather, we would [seek to understand
how this killing is brought about as a consequence of our
education.]{.underline}lxxiv We would [investigate our nihilism, so as
to acknowledge it, better express it, and confront our
downgoing.]{.underline}

### **[Irwin]{.underline}**

#### Failure to accept death through sacrifice means we fail to access the mystical practice of inner experience -- opening our mind to be confronted with the Lacerated quality of our Being allows internalization which tears away the ego and opens us to a meditative and mystical communication that fundamentally undermines the subject/object binary as well as systems of authority and knowledge accumulation -- death might be bad but it's also a part of life and bad is a part of good -- i.e. death is going to happen -- and if we can't laugh in tears as we accept the death of ourselves and all of our Gods then we can't ever truly be happy or free. 

**Irwin 2002** (From Alexander Irwin, in Saints of the Impossible,
"Exercises in Inutility," 2002, p. 151-153)

**[[Inner experience is a form of sacrifice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
his 1961 preface to the re-edition of Guilty, [Bataille described his
**[mysticism as ]{.mark}**]{.underline}\"essentially [**[internalized
violence]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} \[violence rentree\] (BOC V, 493). For
Bataille, [**[the mystic is the]{.mark}** heir of the ancient
**[sacrificial priest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a connection Bataille
underscores by attributing Guilty to \"Dianus,\" the criminal
priest-king of Frazer\'s Golden Bough (see above, chapter 1). [[Mystical
contemplation is]{.mark} nothing other than [sacrificial
violence]{.mark} taken within and [wielded against the self.
Internalized violence **tears the boundaries of the ego and opens the
isolated subject to \"communication\"**: the **\"inhuman joy\"** ---
inseparable from \"despair and madness\" ---in which **subject and
object fuse and dissolve in an ecstatic spasm**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(49, 74). As the example of the \"Tibetan ascetic\" suggests,
**[[anguish and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the visionary **[[confrontation
with one\'s own death provide the emotional force that fuels the
experience]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In Guilty,
[[Bataille]{.underline}]{.mark} makes this program explicit when he
[[outlines his meditational method]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"I am going
[to say how I gained access to ecstasy so intense. [On the wall]{.mark}
of appearance, [I projected images of **explosion**]{.mark}, of
**[laceration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \[\... \] [Obscene, risible,
funereal representations followed one another. [I imagined the depths of
a volcano, war, **my own death**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (BOC V, 269).
[[Turning \"the fury of sacrifice\" against \[the self\]]{.mark}
himself, the meditator is transformed into the pure violence of an inner
\"combat\": \"I decided to attack myself]{.underline} \[m\'en prendre a
moi-meme\]. Seated on the edge of the bed, facing the window and the
night, I worked, struggled to become a combat. The fury to sacrifice,
the fury of sacrifice opposed each other in me like the teeth of two
gears, if they snag at the moment when the drive shaft begins to move\"
(250). [**[In inner experience, sacrificial violence is]{.mark}**
sublimated but at the same time]{.underline}, Bataille insists[,
**[radicalized. In the moment of mystical ecstasy, \"I open my eyes on a
world where I have meaning only as wounded, lacerated,
sacrificed]{.mark}**,]{.underline} where in the same way divinity is
only laceration, putting to death, sacrifice\" (BOC V, 282). The human
being imitates and becomes God [[in the **gesture of self-expenditure**,
in the **\"lama sabachthani\" of pure abandonment, in the spasm of
spiritual death**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taking a cue from the Nietzsche
of [[**Beyond Good and Evil, the mystic kills God** in a mental
ceremony]{.mark} of the \"\'final cruelty\'\"]{.underline} (152) [[in
which **the human subject (the sacrificer) is sanctified and annihilated
along with the (imaginary) divine \"victim.\" \"Laughter in
tears**]{.underline}]{.mark}. ---[The killing of God is a]{.underline}
[sacrifice that, making me tremble, nevertheless lets me laugh, for in
it I succumb no less than the victim]{.underline}\" (178). **[[Dying
with God, the mystic becomes God]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is,
**[[lays claim to an absolute sovereignty: the pure, tragic (and
laughing) freedom imparted by death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 2. **[[The
principle of the experience is infinite
contestation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Bataille understands **[mystical
practice as a radical questioning]{.mark}** not only of specific
contents **[of knowledge,]{.mark}** but of **[the fundamental structures
and operations that make claims to \"knowledge\" possible: including the
ordering structures of language and the coherent identity of the knowing
subject]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The contestation or calling into
question linked to the experience is not circumscribed, but
all-encompassing and interminable. Inner experience corresponds to \"the
necessity where I am --- human existence along with me --- to put
everything at issue (call everything into question) with no rest
allowed\" (BOC V, 15). [Dissolving not \"particular items of
knowledge\"]{.underline} \[connaissances particulieres\] [but their
underlying \"ground,\" **[inner experience plunges into an \"intolerable
unknowing]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[non- savoir\]\" **[[in which \"I
grasp as I fall that the only truth]{.underline}]{.mark}** of man \[\...
\] [**[is to]{.mark}** be a supplication without response]{.underline}\"
(2.5). [**[Deny]{.mark}**ing **[all \"existing values and authorities,\"
the experience itself becomes]{.mark}** \"positively **[the value and
the authority\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (BOC V, 19). But the authority
residing in the experience is necessarily paradoxical: \"founded on
questioning \[sur la mise en question\],\" this authority is itself
constituted by the \"questioning of authority.\" As a \"positive
questioning\" it becomes the \"authority of man defining himself as the
calling into question of himself \[se definissant comme mise en question
de lui-meme\]\" (19, note i). With this paradox at its heart, inner
experience reveals itself as the \"site par excellence\" of the
Bataillean \"impossible.\"42 The [[experience defines the conflicted
field of a practice \"in which the subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, putting
himself into play, [[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[[limits]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is to say **[[the beyond
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** his **[[possible, \'to the point where death
is laughable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\' \"43 **[[In inner experience, \"I
enter a dead end\" in which \"all possibility is exhausted, the possible
slips away, and the impossible rages]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[sevit\].
To face the impossible --- exorbitant, indubitable --- when nothing is
possible any more is in my eyes to have an experience of the divine; it
is analogous to torture\" (45).

#### We claim mystic sovereignty when we accept the sacrificial knowledge of vulnerability, contingency, and penetration by death -- the mystic speaks of death from within death -- we are the executioner of the utilitarian reality, introducing the toxin of the impossible in order to collapse systems of meaning -- a moment of ungluing and intoxication -- Mysticism unmasks the anguish of the underside of experience that is concealed by rationally coordinated political science and philosophy.

**Irwin 2002** (From Alexander Irwin, in Saints of the Impossible,
"Exercises in Inutility," 2002, p. 162-165)

This *parti pris* of responding to a brutal political and military
situation with a mystico-literary self-stylization constitutes the force
and originality, but also, for some, the deeply unsatisfying ambiguity
[of [Bataille\'s mystical subversion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Understanding
Bataille\'s concerns in this way shows, in any event, why [Bataille\'s
position with respect to the violence of the war [could only be
enacted/communicated performatively]{.mark}]{.underline}. What Bataille
sought to present was **[[not a set of ethical propositions or
rationally coordinated political theses, but rather a style of
life]{.mark} that, considered as [a (lacerated but living)
whole]{.mark}, offered [an alternative to the values and forms of
existence that]{.mark} had found their [culmination in totalitarian
oppression and war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[The life of mysticism and
expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark} Bataille proposed [[could
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, he claimed, [[be adequately described
in]{.mark} the language of [philosophical, social scientific, or
political discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline} This mode of life could only
be grasped in its realization (performance) in the existence of an
exemplary being: the mystical writer, Bataille himself. Distancing
himself from the \"professorial\" attitude of academic philosophers like
Heidegger, whose \"method remains glued to results,\" [Bataille
affirmed: \"**[what counts]{.mark}**]{.underline} in my eyes **[[is the
moment of ungluing]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[decollement\]. **[[What I
teach]{.underline}]{.mark}** (if it is true that . . . ) [**[is an
intoxication]{.mark}, not a philosophy. [I am not a philosopher, but a
saint]{.mark}**, maybe **[a madman]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (BOC V, 218
note; ellipsis in original). Bataille was convinced that [[the
meditational method and]{.underline}]{.mark} more broadly the [[mystical
style of existence]{.underline}]{.mark} he made available through his
writings [[opened the route to a concrete experience of the]{.mark}
heterogeneity and [sovereignty of the self and]{.mark} thus laid the
groundwork for **[genuine freedom]{.mark}. The [inner experience]{.mark}
of freedom [remains the precondition of any meaningful deployment of
freedom in]{.mark} [the public, political world]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
And if freedom can be understood in Kantian terms as autolegislation,
then **[[mystical writing initiates autonomy by showing people]{.mark}
that they carry the supreme law within themselves, by teaching them [to
experience themselves as their own law]{.mark} (a law [constituted
through endless contestation]{.mark}]{.underline}**). \"Man is his own
law if he strips himself naked before himself. The mystic before God had
the attitude of a subject. Whoever places being before himself has the
attitude of a sovereign\" (BOC V, 278). **[[The \"naked\" sovereign of
inner experience, \"knowing that]{.underline}]{.mark}** he **[[\[the
self\] will die]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** (278), **[[finds freedom
tempered with the awareness of radical vulnerability and
contingency]{.mark}, thus making freedom inseparable from
\"compassion\"]{.underline}** (273), or as Bataille will later write,
**[from a tragic \"loyalty\"]{.underline}** (BOC XI, 541-45).
**[[Without the sacrificial knowledge of its own penetration by death,
the self\'s exercise of freedom would inevitably become an \"exercise of
power\" over others]{.underline}]{.mark}** (BOC V, 221). **[[Instead,
inner experience is a sacrificial \"conquest\" of the self \"for
others\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (76). **[[Sovereignty is not static
governance but tireless \"revolt\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (221). Through
an unruly mixture of steamy confession, dense philosophical analysis,
histrionic bluster, parodic prayers, lachrymose lamentation,
\"mimicry,\" and irony, **[Bataille\'s textual [mysticism undermines or
overflows the conceptual structures on which the logic of domination
relies. It attacks utility, rationality, hierarchical order, and
identity. By affirming a useless inner experience as in itself \"sole
authority, sole value\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (BOC V, 18),
[**[mysticism challenges the right of coercive political systems to
claim ultimate value and unlimited authority]{.mark} for themselves. [By
introducing --- through \"auto-sacrificial\" writing --- the toxin of
the impossible into calculations of human meaning, Bataille sought to
reach the \"underside\" of language and human experience, to uncover the
\"nakedness\" of irreducible anguish that philosophy and political
theory had sought to conceal, and to \"annul the effects of totalizing
discourse]{.mark}**,\" both in the philosophical and in the political
realms]{.underline}.56 For better or worse (for better and worse),
Bataille\'s writing not only reveals but is the heart of his politics.
The impossible practice of this writing puts on display the forces that
made Bataille momentarily sensitive to fascism\'s seductions, but that
also propelled him irresistibly away from the fascist orbit: his
\"monstrosities in the end rebellious toward all political camps.\"57 It
was this spiritual and political monstrosity --- irreducible
heterogeneity, death-obsessed sacredness, ironic \"sainthood\"---that
Bataille hoped to make contagious. Not by analyzing it, but by being it.
The content of Bataille\'s message was himself: himself **[[as
mystic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as **[[one]{.underline}]{.mark}** who
**[[speaks of death from within death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his
mystical texts Bataille produces himself as one who lives and writes a
hauteur de mort. He demonstrates the confrontation with death in a
context that is precisely not that of the battlefield, in order to show
that [[death\'s impossible and necessary truth
belongs]{.underline}]{.mark} not to the soldiers plunged in the \"vain
noise of combat,\" but [[to the]{.underline}]{.mark} \" \'men of
religious death\' or [[sacrifice]{.mark}\" who raise up death\'s
\"bloody but wholly resplendent image\" in the midst of a \"sacred
silence\"]{.underline} (BOC II, 238). This is the point Bataille
considers it urgent to drive home: that **[[in war or peace human life
only begins to deploy its richness when death is internalized and when
life can be affirmed and loved in and through
death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bataille as **[[the
mystic]{.underline}]{.mark}** o \"la joie supplidante\" **[[embodies
this affirmation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bataille does not merely
articulate the claim, he is the claim that a life lived in the mad
intensity of the *hauteur de mort* is the only life worth having. One
can only \"have\" such a life when one sacrifices it. And one can only
sacrifice it if one loses life consciously: through what Bataille
variously terms \"dramatization,\" \"comedy,\" \"mimetism.\" [By writing
his own [mystical dissolution]{.mark}, Bataille [shows how it is
possible to \"watch \[one\]self ceasing to be]{.mark}\"]{.underline}
(HDS, 19). He models the process through which, like the Tibetan monk in
the burial ground, one can be penetrated by the secrets of death, while
\"the body thus treated remains intact\" (BOC VII, 2.59). **[[What
arises in the experience]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Bataille\'s writing
**[[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** not an irremediable mise-a-mort, but
instead **[[a better way of encountering death\'s power reality and
obviousness which are obscene. It is the truth we should laugh
at]{.underline}]{.mark}**. You can imagine a culture where everyone
laughs spontaneously when someone says: \`This is true\', \`This is
real\'. All this defines the irresolvable relationship between thought
and reality. [[A certain form of thought is bound to the real. It starts
out from the hypothesis that ideas have referents and that there is a
possible ideation of reality. A comforting polarity]{.mark}, which is
that [of tailor-made dialectical and philosophical solutions. **The
other form of thought**]{.mark}]{.underline} is eccentric to the real, a
stranger to dialectics, a stranger even to critical thought. It is not
even a disavowal of the concept of reality. It **[[is illusion, power of
illusion]{.mark}, or, in other words, a [playing with
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as **[[seduction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is a **[[playing with desire]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as metaphor is a
**[playing [with truth.]{.mark} [This radical
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** does not stem from a philosophical doubt,
a utopian transference, or an ideal transcendence. It **[[is the
material illusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, immanent in this so-called
\`real\' world. And thus it seems to come from elsewhere. It seems to be
**[[the extrapolation of this world into another world. At all events,
there is incompatibility between thought and the
real.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is no sort of necessary or natural
transition from the one to the other. Neither alternation, nor
alternative: only otherness and distance keep them charged up. **[[This
is what ensures the singularity of thought]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
singularity by **[[which constitutes an event]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
just like the singularity of the world, the singularity by which it too
constitutes an event.

#### Inner experience is the mystical experience of ecstasy, rapture, passion, and meditation -- inner experience is its own sole authority and value -- subordinating it to external qualities or dogmatizing it with end-points and goals ruins the whole experience

**Irwin '93** (Alexander C. Irwin, "ECSTASY, SACRIFICE, COMMUNICATION:
Bataille on Religion and Inner Experience," Soundings: An
Interdisciplinary Journal, Vol. 76, No. 1, Spring 1993, p. 108-109)

Bataille\'s first approach to writing on spiritual and religious
phenomena presented itself as a passionate, personal exploration of
mystical consciousness. Inner Experience published in 1943, was no work
of disinterested scholarship, but rather the gripping confessional
account of a voyage into an inner world \"in which anguish and ecstasy
intermingle\"(Experienc1e0).2 Bataille acknowledges that his concept of
[inner experience is comparable to forms of mysticism known in the great
religious traditions. Yet \"the experience]{.underline}\" as Bataille
wishes to describe and to live it **[is stripped of the dogmatic labels
and qualifications attached to]{.underline}** mystical states in
**[traditional]{.underline}** religious [**frameworks.** \"I understand
by inner experience what one usually designates as mystical
experience]{.underline},\" Bataille writes: **[that is, \"states of
ecstasy, rapture]{.underline}**, at the very least **[of meditated
emotion]{.underline}**\" (15). Yet, [in reflecting on ecstatic states
and the means of their cultivation]{.underline}, [his preoccupation is
with the **\"naked experience\"** itself, **\"free from attachments,
even as regards its origins**]{.underline}, to any religious confession
whatsoever\"(15). [What concerns him is not]{.underline} \"la chose du
theologien," [reality]{.underline} transcendent [reduced to an object of
quasi-scientific study, but rather the]{.underline} **[raw, immediate,
and convulsive fact of mystical experience itself, the dimensions of
passion and mystery into which the experience leads]{.underline}**.¶
(1.) The Experience Itself as Sole Authority. A first decisive
characteristic of Bataille\'s understanding of inner experience is
announced in the refusal of any form of confessional attachment.
Bataille declines all traditional theological labels for the inner
states he wishes to describe, **[dismissing the claims of
organized]{.underline}** theological **[systems to furnish authoritative
interpretations of mystical explorations]{.underline}**.¶ The
**[\"dogmatic presuppositions]{.underline}**\" of organized religious
traditions have **[\"set unnecessary limits\" on inner
experience]{.underline}** (15). By [integrating the data of mysticism
into **a familiar framework of metaphysical and moral
teachings**]{.underline}, dogmatic religion [**robs the realities
encountered** and apprehended through inner experience **of their force.
Pre-established**]{.underline} religious **[systems and frameworks of
interpretation tame the intensity of the experience, guiding the
spiritual researches of]{.underline}** religious **[mystics into the
narrow channels defined by]{.underline}** theological and ecclesiastical
**[authorities, taking away the decisive capacity of unfettered inner
experience to \"call everything into question\"]{.underline}** (15).
Bataille acknowledges that Christians have \"excelled\" in mystical
investigations, venturing\" as far in this direction as dogma
permitted.\" Yet his own claim is to have followed the method Christian
mystics developed \"with a more bitter rigor\" than Christians
themselves have been able to deploy. Rather than submitting his inner
research to any type of \"end given in advance\" (beatific ecstasy,
communion with God or Christ, etc.), Bataille determines that **[\"the
experience should lead where it will\"]{.underline}**(15). This is true
even (and **[especially) if the experience moves into dark and troubling
regions of the psyche in which traditional]{.underline}** religious
[**categories lose their ability to make sense of events**.
In]{.underline} many if not all [previous cases,]{.underline} Bataille
affirms\", inner experience has had ends beyond itself, in which value
and authority were placed.\" God has played this role in Christianity
and Islam; in Buddhist traditions, the [\"suppression of suffering\" has
been the aim]{.underline} of meditational practice. In other settings,¶
Refined forms of [pleasure or the acquisition of]{.underline}

supernatural [knowledge]{.underline} (enlightenment) [have been regarded
as ends]{.underline} of spiritual discipline(19). [For Bataille, all
such secondary goals fall away. Inner experience has its founding
principle\" neither in a dogma (moral attitude), nor in science
(knowledge can be neither its origin nor its end), nor in a search for
enriching states (experimental, aesthetic attitude]{.underline}).\"
**[The experience\" can have no concern and no goal other than itself.\"
Inner experience is its own \"sole authority, sole
value\"]{.underline}** (18).

### Laceration

#### Thus we affirm ourselves as the stigmatic's before the altar -- creating communication through a laceration of the self -- an openness to the outside which maximizes the cosmic life force within us through an affirmation of the incompleteness within the self. It is before this altar that we engage in the beheading of God and all the values that come with it as a refusal of closure and the completeness of our life as a way to move life to the limit. This stigmatic politic allows us to move to communication from the rational to the irrational, from God to the headless.

**MacKendrick'09 --** Karmen MacKendrick is Professor of Philosophy at
Le Moyne College. She is the author of many books, including Word Made
Skin: Figuring Language at the Surface of Flesh; Fragmentation and
Memory: Meditations on Christian Doctrine; and Divine Enticement:
Theological Seductions (all Fordham). ""The Obsessions of Georges
Bataille Community and Communication" Chapter 8 136-143

In other words, [**stigmatic religiosity is intense** and
corporeal]{.underline}, as we might indeed expect; [it is]{.underline},
for those who are taking it seriously, [**communication with the
incarnate passion of God**.The **opened space** in the body
is]{.underline} also the [**mark of the opening** of a communicative
space]{.underline}, a creation of community with Christianity\'s
embodied divine. [Bataille distinguishes the communication that links
two beings from that in which being itself is shattered]{.underline}---
[communica tion with the beyond, the ungraspable, the sense of one's own
death]{.underline} (OC 5: 388/G 139). Stigmata, communic[ation by
being-in-common with the pain of the passion]{.underline}, is
fascinating in some measure because it insists upon both at once:
[communication with the person of Christ and the mutual beyond of
agonizing death, in which God, too, "is\" otherwise than
being.]{.underline}

Bataille writes that **[communication requires laceration, a violent
openness:]{.underline}**

The more perfect, the more isolated or confined to ourselves we are. But
th[e wound of incompleteness opens me up]{.underline}.Through what could
be called incompleteness or animal nakedness or the wound, [the
different separate beings communicate, acquiring life by losing it in
communication]{.underline} with each other. (OC 5: 263/G 27)

And again:

[Incompletion, the wound, and the pain that has to be there if com
munication is to take place]{.underline}. Completion--- the contrary of
this.

[What\'s requisite for communication is a]{.underline} defect or
'[fault]{.underline}.\' [**Communication enters like death through a
chink** in the armor. What\'s required is an overlapping of two
lacerations, mine and yours.]{.underline} (OC 5: 266/G 30)

[Seldom]{.underline}, of course, [is the laceration as literal as that
of wounds open ing in the skin. But the woundedness]{.underline} of the
stigmatic [is never "simply" physical]{.underline} in a reductive sense;
[rather, the physical suffering seems invariably to be accompanied by an
intensity of spiritual]{.underline} or psychological
\"[experience]{.underline}\" that necessarily registers as agonizing. 18
[Bataille]{.underline} too [emphasizes not only the wound
but]{.underline} also its [painfulness]{.underline} (OC 5: 266/G 30);
**[laceration is not the neatly anaesthetized opening]{.underline}** of
a surgical procedure. [It is **only thus that the wound cuts all the way
through**, from skin to self.]{.underline}

[Pain is constant]{.underline}, a necessary attendant to the experience
but also essential in itself, [as the rending intensity of this
communication necessarily exceeds the boundaries of
pleasure]{.underline}; as [pain functions both as a sign of this
intensity]{.underline} and as a means of intensification. Rene Biot
writes that [suffering "is never absent, whatever the form of
stigmatization.]{.underline} It is always intense."19 [Often the
stigmata seem to hurt just as if the marks had been received by more
evident means]{.underline}. Or, as in the case of nineteenth-century
stigmatic Anne Catherine Emmerich, "a vision of Jesus appeared to her
with wounds that 'shone like so many furnaces of light' and felt as if
they burnt into her flesh."20

This [communicative agony might seem an unlikely place for the
sacred,]{.underline} given Bataille's insistence, "[For those who
understand communication as laceration, communication is
sin]{.underline}, or evil. **[It's a breaking of the established
order]{.underline}**" (OC 5: 305/G 65). But it is [important that this
sense of "evil\" is \"a breaking of the established order]{.underline},"
including the [order of the profane and the sustainable hierarchy of the
church]{.underline} (always threatened by ecstasy and charisma, both of
which tend to be rather strongly manifested by stig matics--- think of
the famous recent example of Padre Pio). The "[apex of
sacrifice,]{.underline}" Bataille declares, [is the "inexpiable crime"
of the crucifixion]{.underline}; the [body of the **stigmatic blurs the
boundaries of sacrificial priest and victim,**]{.underline} as Christ's
blurs those between the sacrifice offered and the god to whom that
offering is directed: all of **[sacrifice bleeds together in the flowing
of open wounds]{.underline}**.

This [sacrificial **death of God,**]{.underline} irredeemable except as
self-redeeming (not after or despite, but in its mortal violence),
[**opens the space for the movement beyond subjectivity into the opening
o f the self**. The contestation of the subject]{.underline}, the
ripping-open of the self, [comes out of that subject\'s own agony of
desire]{.underline}. The [finitude of the self]{.underline}, the
boundaries that make it, o[pen to the infinity of the
divine]{.underline}, shattering in flesh and blood the order of the
profane--- in imitation of the mortal wounds of the bleeding, dying,
glori fied God. Here [the sacred is not the "set apart," but that which
is neither apart nor contained.21]{.underline}

[In this ecstatic opening, communication becomes
possible]{.underline}.This "experi ence" [wounds---
opens]{.underline}--- the finite creature: "ecstatic, breathless,
experience thus opens a bit more every time the horizon of God ([the
wound): extends a bit more the limits of the heart, the limits of
being]{.underline}\" (OC 5: 122/IE 103-04). The horizon of God is the
wound: so [God too, at the limit of the divine, is wounded, and this
indeed is the point upon which stigmata are based. The wound opened in
the stigmatic skin bleeds out into the God who enters
there.]{.underline}

[Stigmatism belongs to a religious tradition emphasizing not only human
but also divine desire, God's desire for entry into
humanity,]{.underline} just as "No greater desire exists than a wounded
person\'s need for another wound" (OC 5: 267/G 31)---the desire invoked
in those prayerful pleas for God's wounding love. [Communication
requires not one wound but]{.underline} (at least) [two]{.underline},
"an [overlapping of two lacerations]{.underline}" (OC 5: 266/G 30). [But
to lacerate God, the only way to communicate, cannot be other than
sinful;]{.underline}22 hence [sin and salvation are intertwined, again
beyond a simple sense in which one pays for the other.]{.underline}

The more obvious, and in fact simplistic, [versions of salvation would
have stigmata be salvific in a sort of working-off-the-debt arrangement;
suffer enough]{.underline}, as those who are wounded and bleeding surely
do, [and you get to]{.underline} go somewhere pretty [and sit on
clouds]{.underline}. 1 would like to suggest what seems to me a somewhat
[richer possibility, in which suffering itself is
transformed]{.underline}, not merely for what one gets as a reward but
inherently, in which [mutilation transforms the possibilities of the
self---by violently opening the space of divine
communication]{.underline}. Bataille calls ascetic activity mutilation,
but he adds, "[If it is a question of salvation, let one
mutilate]{.underline}" (OC 5: 36/IE 23). [Thus one seeks to provoke
anguish, itself a means of knowing]{.underline}; "[communication still
is, like anguish, to live and to know]{.underline}" (OC 5: 52/IE 39).
[This "knowledge" is not a set of facts, nor this communication their
transmission; it is the knowledge with which we return to ourselves from
our own ecstatic loss]{.underline} (OC 5: 67-68/IE 53). "**[Anguish
assumes the desire to communicate--- that is, to lose
myself]{.underline}**---but not complete resolve: anguish is evidence of
my fear of communicating, of losing myself" (OC 5: 67/IE 53). [Rapture
or ecstasy occurs only in giving in, necessarily fleetingly, to
self-loss.]{.underline}

[Lack or incompletion]{.underline}, implied [by]{.underline} the
[opening in a space that seems to demand closure, is]{.underline}
likewise [essential to communication]{.underline}; there must be a point
of entry. [God and human alike lack wholeness]{.underline} (OC 5: 135/IE
116), [are lacking, and are thus, potentially at least, open to one
another.]{.underline}23 This connects us back to the shocking foundation
of Christianity in the sacrifice of God: "[**There's a necessity for god
to be killed**: to see the world in the **weakness of
incompletion**]{.underline}. The next thought to occur is that, [come
what may, the world has to be completed]{.underline}, although this is
what's impossible and incomplete. [Everything real fractures and
cracks]{.underline}" (OC 5: 262/G 27).

Taking up Bataillean notions of communication and community, Jean-Luc
Nancy and Maurice Blanchot understand [community as the place in which
the self becomes possible, not by isolation and boundary-marking but by
exposition, by being open to others, to otherness,]{.underline} and by
being held in memory. Finite and limited, [we are not
self-contained]{.underline}; as Nancy empha sizes, [community is not a
subsequent gathering of individuals but the very undoing of the absolute
immanence that individuality suggests.]{.underline}24

As we have already noted, [the space of communication demands for
Bataille the violent openness of laceration]{.underline}, a [woundedness
linked]{.underline} directly [to]{.underline} the possibility of
[speaking]{.underline}: \"Should one sew my lips together," Bataille
asks, "like those of a wound!" (OC 5: 81/IE 67). Nancy warns against a
simple conflation of community and communicative laceration but notes
that "[what tears apart is the presentation of finitude in and by
community]{.underline}."23And [it is not one-self that is
lacerated:]{.underline}

[What is lacerated . . . is not the singular being:]{.underline} on the
contrary, [this is where the singular being compears. Rather, it is the
communal fabric, it is immanence that is lacerated]{.underline}. And yet
this laceration does not happen to anything, for this fabric does [not
exist. There is no tissue, no flesh, no subject or substance of common
being, and consequently there is no laceration of this being. But there
is sharing out]{.underline}\.... "[**Laceration" consists only in
exposure**: the entire "inside" of the singular being is exposed to the
"outside.\"2\'\']{.underline}

This [openness to alterity is the space of community]{.underline} and
communication for finite beings, so it [might seem to have little place
in an effort to understand divine communication]{.underline} (at least
in a tradition that understands God as infinite). But [stigmata
emphasize the paradox of an infinite God]{.underline} made flesh,
sharing finitude, vulnerability, even mortality ([if God is not dead,
the resurrection is at best a parlor trick) to emphasize that we are not
only finite. They mark a sharing not in any customary notion of divine
glory but in the degradation of mutilation]{.underline} and the ecstasy
of suffering. Here, the [stigmatic finds not "self" in the sense of
individuality but the wounding of subjectivity past mortal limits, the
laceration of self that **opens self onto the unlimited**.]{.underline}

Nancy in particular links community specifically to the Christian incar-
national myth. [Noting the dual and conflicting Christian myths of the
deus absconditus]{.underline} and the familial, familiar human god, he
writes that "[the thought of community or the desire for it might well
be nothing other than a belated invention]{.underline} that [tried to
respond to the harsh reality of modern experience]{.underline}: namely,
that [divinity was withdrawing indefinitely from immanence]{.underline},
that the [god-brother was at bottom luntself the deus
absconditus]{.underline} \... and that the [divine essence of
community--- or community as the existence of a divine
essence]{.underline}--- [was the impossible itself]{.underline}."27 The
[impossible]{.underline}, o f course, is precisely [what draws
Bataille's interest. The divinity evoked by stigmata is not absolute
immanence any more than it is transcendence of the human
condition]{.underline}; it is [**woundedness, opening, the refusal of
closure**.]{.underline} It is the [desire to experience at once the
fleeing of God]{.underline}, a God who seems to have forsaken the
mortally wounded humanity of his son-self; and the [God who returns and
sustains, who without closing the wounds nonetheless lives again in the
flesh.]{.underline} Thus [stigmata mark at once the
with-ness]{.underline} (the impossible necessity of community in the
absence of self-sufficiency) [of finite and vulnerable beings, and
ecstasy, the opening of the self to the divine beyond
finitude]{.underline}. "What community reveals to me," says Nancy
apropos of Bataille, "is [my existence outside myself."]{.underline}38
But we may also think, with Blanchot, from the outside: what community
with the divine reveals is the outside of my existence, myself otherwise
than in (my) being.

In a seeming paradox that echoes th is problematizing o f inside and
out, [Bataille connects "inner experience]{.underline}," that famously
contradictory state that defies the interiority of the experiencing
subject, [to community: "**there cannot be \... inner experience without
a community** of those who live it]{.underline}" (OC 5: 37/IE [24).
Complete, whole beings would not communicate; they would be "isolated or
confined]{.underline} to \[them\]selves" (OC 5: 263/G 27). Blanchot
similarly notes, \"[A being, insufficient as it is, does not attempt to
associate itself with another being]{.underline} to make up a substance
of integrity. The [aware ness of the insufficiency arises from the fact
that it puts itself in question]{.underline}, which question needs the
other or another to be enacted. [Left on its own, a being closes
itself]{.underline}, falls asleep and calms down. [A being is either
alone or knows itself to be alone only when it is not]{.underline}."29
[A being seeks others not in order to fill its gaps and complete itself
but in order to be exposed]{.underline} (open ing the "inside" of the
singular being), [to be present to the other in a way that makes plain
one's incompleteness]{.underline}--- or even makes one's incompleteness.
Thus on[e starts "being only in that privation that makes it conscious
\... of the impossibility of being itself, of subsisting as its ipse or,
if you will, as itself as a separate individual:]{.underline} this way
it will perhaps ex-ist, [experiencing itself as an always prior
exteriority]{.underline}, or as an existence shattered through and
through."30 Again, [stigmata make this literally clear, rupturing the
body, mak ing the interior blood and fluid exterior, the interior pain
visibly manifest, the existence shattered, the prayer suffer me not to
be separated agonizingly fulfilled in open wounds, vivid welts, bleeding
eyes.]{.underline}

The [**opening of stigmata**, the moment of community, of the violent
intimacy o f communication, **is thus the moment o f
laceration**]{.underline}, o f [the self not merely wounded but torn
apart]{.underline} by the ecstasy of the death of God. According to
Blanchot, "[Death, the death of the other, like friendship or love,
clears the space of intimacy]{.underline} or [interiority which is
never]{.underline} (for Georges Bataille) [the space o f a subject, but
a gliding beyond limits.]{.underline} '[T h e Inner
Experience\']{.underline} says the opposite of what it seems to say: it
[is a movement of contestation that, coming from the subject, devastates
it, but has as a deeper origin the relationship with the other which is
community itself, a com munity that would be nothing if it died not open
the one who exposes himself to it to the infiniteness of
alterity]{.underline}, while at the same time deciding its inexorable
finitude.'" [The subject desires to get out of itself, but this is
self-loss; exposure to the divine is a devastating intimacy]{.underline}
at the intensity of death, **[where alone community can
exist.]{.underline}**

Thus, [in that moment of knowing ourselves to be alone]{.underline}---
of [participat ing in the passionate question why have you forsaken
me?]{.underline}--- [we seek not to be,]{.underline} seek the
[shattering of our own existence]{.underline}, seek to put ourselves
into question. Blanchot writes, "What, then, calls me into question most
radically? Not my relation to myself as finite or as the consciousness
of being before death or for death, but my presence for another who
absents himself by dying.. .. [to take upon myself another's death as
the only death that concerns me, this is what puts me beside
myself,]{.underline} this is the only [separation that can open
me,]{.underline} in its very impossibility, [to the Openness of a
community]{.underline}.\"32 The [**stigmatic takes upon herself a very
peculiar death,** a death with life at its maximum of
intensity]{.underline}--- eternal or divine life--- [already bound up in
it, an impossible death of a God in human flesh:]{.underline}13Thus too
[we find **community at its maximum**]{.underline}. Blanchot writes,
"What purpose does \[community\] serve? None, unless it would be to make
present the service to others unto/in death, so that the other does not
get lost all alone\_\_\_ Georges Bataille writes: ' . . . a [commu nity
can last only at the level of the intensity of death]{.underline}.\'
"-14 [Community here become salvific so that we do not get lost all
alone.]{.underline}

[Nancy likewise links death]{.underline} (which we, even knowing
ourselves mortal, can only encounter as the death of an other)
intimately [to community.]{.underline} "A community is the presentation
to members of their mortal truth\.... [It is the presentation of the
finitude and the irredeemable excess that make up finite being: its
death, but also its birth, and only the community can present me my
birth,]{.underline} and along with it the impossibility of my reliving
it, as well as the impossibility of my crossing over into my
death."3\"The [reliving of the passion and crucifixion impossibly
suspend the stigmatic between the moments of death and
birth:]{.underline} "to not reach an end was one of the exigencies of
Bataille's endeavor"\'16 [This is the realm of Blanchot's "unworking,"
beyond questions of \"production or completion."17 **The deadly wounds
of Christ perpetually reopen**, unfinalized, incomplete, in the bodies
of communicating believers]{.underline}, bodies asking the impossible;
that is, seeking union, fusion, the [**completion of communication in
another's death**; in that death, by its peculiarly double and temporary
character, is an infinity of life.]{.underline}

[Community is inherently]{.underline}, necessarily unfinished,
[unclosed, and so at once finite]{.underline}--- [because it does not
extend forever, but lasts only at the inten sity of imminent
destruction]{.underline}--- and without defined limits, even opening the
ecstatically wounded body to the limitless joy and suffering of the
divine.18 [Stigmata represent a communicative pair,]{.underline} the
stigmatic and Christ, [less like the community of a society and more
like what Blanchot calls the \"com munity of lovers"; \"love . . .
exposes the unworking and therefore the inces sant incompletion of
community]{.underline}. . . . [Lovers form the extreme though not the
external limit o f community"]{.underline} 19 [But, complicating the
distinction, stigmata occur disproportionately often in members o f
religious communities, pushing the community formed around the story of
the incarnate God to the limit o f recognizing that carnality within
itself.]{.underline}

[In the scar as a site o f memory]{.underline}, I recently argued, [one
finds oneself where one was absent]{.underline}.41The **[site of the
stigmatic wound may be more complex still]{.underline}**. The **[wound
is the opening o f communication]{.underline}**, the
[all-the-way-through laceration of body and spirit without the strict
division that modernity will impose upon them as if it were
self-evident.]{.underline} The [edges of the stigmatics blood-seeping
wounds overlap with those o f the perpetually wounded figure of
Christ]{.underline} (even in stories of his resurrected body, the wounds
remain unhealed) in a moment of impossible communication, [the formation
of an impossible community of self and God, a community in which neither
stigmatic nor God is a being in the sense of self-containment, of
definite, defined existent]{.underline}. The stigmata form community as
the Eucharist forms communion, [at the moment of death with an emphasis
on corporeality]{.underline} (this is my blood), [but at the same time
at a moment of life pushed to shattering intensity]{.underline}. "The
[quick of life would be the burn of a wound]{.underline}," says
Blanchot, and so it is here, [God and human sharing the ultimate
vulnerability to death]{.underline}.41 In the presence of one dying, the
[stigmatic seems to be taken over by a memory so somatic as to transform
her identity into that of another]{.underline}. We may be assured that
Francis' "[fervour grew so strong within him that he became wholly
transformed into Jesus through his love and compassion]{.underline},\"
as if a [singular identity were constituted repeatedly in the bodies of
stigmatics following Christ]{.underline}.42 Yet this is not quite right
either; it is not the case that now there are two of Christ and none of
Francis or any other stigmatic, but rather that [in this communication
with the open space of the sacred, neither human nor divine retains the
identity o f presence]{.underline}. Rather, "[identity" is shared in the
space of absence, in the inside-out of "inner" experience, in the wound.
In the presence o f one who is dying---- at the limit o f
vulnerability--- the stigmatic does not merely reenact the passion and
crucifixion of the sacrificed God but **sacrifices herself in
communication: and this, this ecstatic vulnerability, this violent
intimacy, is what remains to us** of the sacred after Christianity's
ultimate paradoxical madness in the sacrifice of God.]{.underline}

#### Sitting meditation, a glorious expenditure of energy, is a way to cultivate the deep affirmation of earthly life and its finitude. As a form of existential micropolitics, it is crucial to addressing systemic domination to solve for social justice that spread beyond debate to the larger society.

For Trungpa, sitting meditation is a way to embody the sovereignty that
Bataille argued for: "Meditation practice begins by sitting down and
assuming your seat cross-legged on the ground\... You realize that you
are capable of sitting like a king or queen on a throne. e regal- ness
of that situation shows you the dignity that comes from being still and
simple."83 [Sitting meditation is a glorious expenditure of energy; it
is a way of touching into and affirming nature's basic richness and
overflow.]{.underline} Bataille's account of earthly richness resonates
strongly with Trung- pa's analysis of basic goodness. What Bataille adds
is a robust biophys- ical account of energetic richness, one focused on
the fact of surplus solar energy. is material reality helps ground the
idea of basic good- ness. I have personally found Bataille's work
helpful in making sense of my meditation practice, the primary technique
taught by Trungpa for experiencing our basic goodness. [When people sit,
let go of conceptual thought, and connect to the ephemeral present,
feelings of impressive intensity often arise.]{.underline} For me, the
intensity of these feelings compels countless e orts to escape, and I
regularly reach for the protection of conceptual and egoic thought. But
understanding these feelings as em- blematic of the fundamental
exuberance of earthly life has helped me gradually befriend them. I have
come to see meditation as a form of "intensity training": I am slowly
learning to be with the exuberance of the world. Joining Bataille's
analysis of solar lavishness with Trungpa's account of basic goodness
has helped with my intensity training. e rawness I experience during
meditation, while still intense, is less over- whelming than it used to
be. It has actually come to feel good---an op- portunity to ride life's
e usion, life's goodness. Marcus Boon hypoth- esizes that "Bataille's
own theories of excess and general economy are themselves the product
of, and if you like, profit from, his meditation practice. Meditation, a
practice of sovereignty, of the 'non-useful,' was precisely used by
Bataille as a secret source of the theory of sovereign- ty."84
Bataille's theoretical work was partly inspired by Buddhist praxis, but
can be looped back to help conceptualize the experience of medita- tion.
Going beyond discursive thought is a Buddhist aim, but access to good
concepts can help with the process of letting go of our conceptual
resistances to the existential real. Bataille's account of earthly
richness, coupled with Trungpa's contemplative instructions for feeling
and em- bodying that richness, are helpful tools in the vital cultural
struggle against existential resentment. Georges Bataille and Chögyam
Trungpa help us theorize the use of mind-body practices in
transformative social movements. ey both add a powerful rationale to
those already deployed by activists. [If there are existential drivers
behind systemic dominations like colonialism, capitalist exploitation,
white supremacy, and hetero-patriarchy, then existential micropolitics
like meditation become central to addressing the causes of injustice,
not only their effects. The accounts provided by both Bataille and
Trungpa clarify how efforts to integrate mind-body practices into social
movements are vital, more than peripheral, to the political success of
the Left. Increasing opportunities for activists to feel their basic
richness will help transform dominative and controlling impulses that
can arise in everyone, even those of us committed to social
justice.]{.underline} As both Trung- pa and Bataille argue, it is easy
for humans to feel small in the face of nitude, and compensate with
controlling behavior. By cultivating the capacity to experience the
richness of earthly life through meditative technique, social movements
can forestall the e ects of existential re- sentment within their
ranks---e ects like oppressions that are replicat- ed among activists
themselves.85 is will make movements more cohe- sive and capable of
achieving social, ecological, and economic justice.86 [Cultivating a
deep affirmation of earthly life---including its fini- tude---can help
activists "be the change" in radical and embodied ways, ensuring that
their subjectivities are fertile ground for the generosity, solidarity,
and equity that are the emotional building blocks for more just
societies.]{.underline} Similarly, a sociality among activists rooted in
the mu- tual experience of basic goodness can serve as a vital pre
guration of enlightened and egalitarian societies. [Social movements
provide vital experimental ground for new social and cultural relations
that can then be spread to the larger society.]{.underline}

#### We present Bataille's theory of laceration as a vehicle for endurance and black care to open up modes of survival while interrogating underlying power structures of anti-blackness

**Warren, 17** (1-19-17, Calvin Warren is an Assistant Professor in
WGSS. He received his B.A. in Rhetoric/Philosophy (College Scholar) from
Cornell University and his MA and Ph.D. in African American/American
Studies from Yale University, "Black Care," Liquid Blackness: Volume

http://liquidblackness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LB6-WARREN.pdf)

[On August 10, 2016, the Department of Justice released a report
exposing disturbing practices in the Baltimore Police Department. It
details the persistence of anti-black violence, abuse, inveterate
neglect, and routinized humiliation. Graphs, statistics, and anecdotal
narratives create a vicious tapestry of signs and symbols.1 This
tapestry requires deciphering, for what it says is more than just
persistent injustice, but "something" else, which requires a different
grammar. Rev. Heber Brown III, speaking to the New York Times about the
report, recounts a disturbing instance. A teenage boy was stopped and
strip-searched in front of his girlfriend.]{.underline} After he filed a
complaint with the police department, the officer, it seems, wanted
revenge and stopped the young boy again, strip-searched him, and this
time grabbed his genitals. The officer, intoxicated by unchecked power
over black bodies, wanted to injure "something" else, not just the
teenager's body. The reverend states, ["What that officer did is not
just violate a body, but he injured a spirit, a soul, a psyche. And that
young boy will not easily forget what happened to him, in public with
his girlfriend. It's hard to really put gravity and weight to that type
of offense."2 Rev. Brown introduces a "type of offense," which is
difficult to decipher or translate into a framework of redress and
injury. The offense he describes lacks a grammar to capture precisely
the "target" of such violence.]{.underline} The phrase "a spirit, a
soul, a psyche" moves us toward a conceptualization of this target, but
it remains indecipherable in some sense, a "something" vulnerable to
destructive practices. [We can also understand the "strip search" itself
as an allegory of anti-black 36 liquid blackness : volume three, issue
six violence: what is stripped is not just clothes and garments, but
something metaphysical, a metaphysical stripping away of the
constitutive elements of a person's being. "A spirit, a soul, a psyche"
is sadistically stripped and dishonored. The "gravity and weight\" of
the offense is the density of a metaphysical violence--- in which black
being is incessantly stripped, ripped apart, and humiliated. This
violence is without end, without reprieve, without reason or
logic.]{.underline} Both the metaphysical target and the violence are
indecipherable because they constitute a non-sense sign within the
grammar of redress and humanism. [Put differently, antiblackness renders
both metaphysical violence and the "spirit, soul, psyche" untranslatable
within ethics, law, and politics since these fields assume a coherent
human ontology---and Blacks lack being]{.underline}. Furthermore,
neither law, ethics, nor politics can adequately address "what" is
injured liquid blackness : volume three, issue six 37 (this "whatness"
is invalid within its precincts); in other words, it cannot redress what
it cannot address. Black existence confronts metaphysical violence
continually, without the possibility of political or legal reprieve
(since the object of the violence does not translate politically or
legally). Violence without end, violence without reprieve, violence
constitutive of a metaphysical world (the violence sustaining the
world's systems and institutions) is what the teenager experienced. The
injury is, indeed, immeasurable--- it fractures "something," a deep
metaphysical structure. The question before us becomes: [How does black
existence address metaphysical violence? Moreover, can we even answer
this question and with what grammar do we broach it? These are, indeed,
difficult questions but our aim, here, is not to answer them
apodictically (since such an endeavor is impossible), but to present a
meditative strategy: black care.]{.underline} II. [Lacerations and
Hieroglyphics We can consider the metaphysical "injury" a laceration and
a hieroglyph. What is "stripped" or ruptured leaves a mark---a sign of
destruction that is itself a "witness" of the violation. As witness, the
sign itself bears a tragic testimony, a recounting of the violence. But
what is the sign communicating? The sign, the laceration, becomes a
hieroglyph open to a cultural reading and hermeneutical practice. While
what it says is not easily interpreted, it can be felt or registered on
a different plane of existence. We rely on the affective dimension to
translate the ineffable, or more precisely, to provide form for an
experience anti-blackness places outside ethics and the "customary lexis
of life and culture," as Hortense Spillers would describe
it]{.underline}.3 Feelings 38 liquid blackness : volume three, issue six
Dreams are colder than Death (directed by Arthur Jafa, 2013), frame
grab. provide a necessary vessel for containing unbearable suffering and
a vehicle for communicating this experience when traditional avenues of
communication are absent. Put differently, affect is a communicative
structure, a testimony, for articulating suffering without end. The
affective dimension is just as expansive as it is deep, so expressivity
is boundless within this dimension. Affect is an invaluable resource for
those enduring a metaphysical holocaust; it is the premier form of
expressivity. Spillers presents metaphysical violence as a "laceration
or wounding." The undecipherable signs produced: ...render a kind of
hieroglyphic of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be hidden to
the cultural seeing by skin color. [We might ask if this phenomenon of
marking and branding actually "transfers" from one generation to
another, finding its various symbolic Black Care liquid blackness :
volume three, issue six 39 substitutions in an efficacy of meanings that
repeat the initiating moments?4 What is injured, then, is the
"flesh"---the "primary narrative... seared divided, ripped-apartness,
riveted to the ship's hole, fallen, or "escaped" overboard."5 As a
"primary narrative," the flesh is the metaphysical target of violence.
The flesh, then, is the structure of black existence, an ontological
grounding of sorts, which anti-blackness incessantly
targets.]{.underline} It is the flesh "Rev. Brown introduces a 'type of
offense,' which is difficult to decipher or translate into a framework
of redress and injury" Black Care that becomes injured, and this injury
leaves a "laceration" or hieroglyph attesting to the brutality. [Thus,
the laceration is not just a corporeal sign; although the body might
bear its marks, it is registered elsewhere. But what is of interest here
is that the laceration as hieroglyph might actually "transfer from one
generation to the next, finding its various symbolic substitutions in an
efficacy of meanings that repeat the initiating moment."6 The laceration
speaks through symbolic substitutions across time, across generations.
In other words, the laceration is a constitutive feature of black
existence in an antiblack world, and it travels; antiblackness mobilizes
it across time (and space). It is indecipherable because it is
paradoxical: it is consistent and substitutional, individual and
generational, mobile and intransigent. One cannot capture it exactly as
it 4 0 liquid blackness : volume three, issue six moves across
generations, but the metaphysical harm it indexes is felt deeply. Thus,
what the teenager in Baltimore experienced was a transferable
laceration, one which is flesh-destroying.]{.underline} The injury is
much more than humiliation---rather, it is an onto-metaphysical
destruction. We might also inquire about the "efficacy of meaning,"
since the hieroglyph means even though it is indecipherable. [Georges
Bataille understands laceration as a possibility of communication, which
leaves the subject fractured. Communication occurs precisely because the
subject is not intact, which allows for something like a flow of
communication. He says, "your life is not limited to that ungraspable
inner streaming \[mere inner consciousness\], it streams to the outside
as well and opens itself incessantly to what flows out or surges toward
it."7 Bataille suggests the laceration preconditions communication,
since the laceration is a rupture, an opening that creates "The 'gravity
and weight' of the offense is the density of a metaphysical violence"
Black Care a nexus between inside/outside, self/ other, and
individual/community. I introduce Bataille, here, to suggest that what
Spillers describes as an undecipherable marking, transferable across
generations, is a form of communication---since this marking speaks and
means by dissolving the distinctions between individual/ community and
inside/outside.]{.underline} The "efficacy of meaning" is found in the
generational transfer itself. [The metaphysical laceration, furthermore,
is an indecipherable liquid blackness : volume three, issue six 41 sign
that must be communicated, in order to recover the efficacy of
(non)meaning. In other words, we may not know exactly what the
hieroglyph "means," but the efficacy of meaning does not reside merely
in certainty]{.underline} (the certitude of comprehension); instead,
meaning's efficacy can be found in the transfer (or communication) of
uncertainty. Transferring the undecipherable sign through and as
communication (from individual, communities, and generations) provides a
space of address. Address without redress. [It is in the address---as
the communicative flow of lacerative signs---that we are able to endure
metaphysical violence. Even though we cannot eradicate metaphysical
violence, since it is a constitutive component of an anti-black world,
we can use the laceration as a vehicle for endurance: black
care.]{.underline}

### Laughter

#### The modern world is driven by the notions of complete universality through the imposition of value onto bodies. Instead you should affirm laughter in the face of rationality and laughter in the face of death as a mode of communication which ruptures the image of the rational being. Bataille says that this seemingly meaningless process of mockery is one that exceeds the very spatiality of normative communication and moves life itself to its greatest intensity.

**Lingis'09** -- Alphonso Lingis is an American philosopher, writer and

State University. His areas of specialization include phenomenology,
existentialism, modern philosophy, and ethics. "The Obsessions of
Georges Bataille Community and Communication" Chapter 7 pg 119-122

With humans it may seem that [physical shape and voice help us to
recognize members of our own species]{.underline}. But the approach of
other humans is a territorial encroachment. Instead of being drawn to
them, [humans have,]{.underline} from time immemorial, [formed
themselves into particular groups and regard outside groups with
anxiety, distrust, and fear. Culture is the means for us to acquire a
particular identity]{.underline}: we [identify with one another and
against other groups]{.underline} by cultivating distinctive garb; [a
particular language]{.underline}; distinc tive group-affirming
performances such as games, dances, and feasts; and a distinctive
religion.

**[What breaks us out]{.underline}** of this group identity [and
identifies us to outsiders as of our own kind **is for Georges Bataille
not rational thought, but laughter**]{.underline} and sexual excitement.
In a foreign place, those with whom we have no language or commitment to
ancestors, leaders, or gods in common, with whom we are not engaged in
any common practical project, are remote and alien to us. Then something
happens--- [the abrupt breakdown of practical operations, a planned and
foreseen outcome that turns out to be unwork able--- that releases an
outbreak of laughter. The **laughter rebounds among us and renders us
transparent** to one another: I see in the one who laughs with me
someone of my kind.]{.underline}

Distinctive to human mammals is the propensity to become sexually
aroused outside o f any breeding season and outside o f reproductive
intent and even possibility. While most humans engage in sexual bonds
and com mitments with members of their own community and culture, they
find themselves erotically aroused by foreigners and outcasts. In
witnessing the erotic exhibitionism o f courtesans and temple
prostitutes, Hollywood celebri ties, and idle adolescents in any foreign
land, we are aroused and recognize in those aroused about us people like
ourselves.

[This sphere of communication in laughter]{.underline}--- and in
tears--- and in erotic excitement precedes and [**makes possible, and is
not superseded by, communi cation** in rational thought and in practical
projects conceived and regulated by rational language.]{.underline} Here
[communication is recognition of others as of our kind and attraction to
them. Laughter]{.underline} and tears [give rise to blessings and
cursings--- the primary form o f speech. We gather together to speak o f
what amuses]{.underline} and what torments [us]{.underline}, what we
bless and curse.

We commonly say that [**language is a means of communication**; through
a common language individuals exchange their experiences and insights
and build a knowledge that is common]{.underline}. But [language
continually breaks into diverse tongues and dialects and multiplies
technical languages and jargons. And language]{.underline}, Voltaire
remarked, [could almost be said to have been invented in order that men
dissimulate their thoughts.]{.underline}

Before the Second World War, in his book The Crisis of European Sci
ences and Transcendental Phenomenology,\' Edmund Husserl argued that
[with rational language and the practical projects they regulate,
**humans, despite their cultural particularisms, achieve community**.
**Rational thought captures the patterns and events that are observed in
the field of perception of individuals in universal
concepts**]{.underline} and formulates the relations between things and
events in laws and theories open to verification and contestation by
anyone, anywhere. [The **rational individual submits** his observations
and reasons to the judgment of anyone endowed with the power of insight
and understanding.]{.underline} T h e [practice o f rational thought
projects, beyond particular communities bound together by common
practical projects for defense and productive work, the
idea,]{.underline} idea-limit, or ideal [of universal
humanity]{.underline}. Today the [electronic communication]{.underline}
technology invented after the Second World War and distributed across
the planet [is taken to assume and promote this ideal of universal
rational humanity.]{.underline}

But the integral rational agent, as Immanuel Kant depicts him, in fact
does not communicate: instead in her words and her actions she makes
herself an exemplar for everyone. For the rational agent to respect the
other is to respect the law that rules in her and that binds her also.

**[Humans communicate]{.underline}**, we commonly say, [**in order to
build.** and by building, a common work--- a productive enterprise,
civil society, and a state apparatus. Each then makes himself or herself
a means and not an end.]{.underline} What are left are the roads, the
high-rise buildings, corporations, and the [states that absorb the
builders into their anonymous material subsistence]{.underline} or
subsistence as an anonymous regional or global order.

Georges [Bataille separates the notion of communication from that of
commonality]{.underline} or communion; for him "[communication"
designates the con tact of an individual with what is and remains beyond
him. **Communication requires sovereign moments** in
individuals.]{.underline}

This [sovereignty is neither autonomy nor domination]{.underline} over
others; it [is a state individuals find in themselves]{.underline}. It
is [opposed to servility]{.underline}, which for Bataille is not only
subjection to another's will but also [subjection to the system of tools
that are aligned toward utilitarian ends]{.underline} fixed by our needs
and wants. The [sense of a void inside, a lack felt as a
need]{.underline}--- hunger, thirst, vulnerability before cold or heat
or predators--- [produces the search for outside objects to sustain
us]{.underline} and motivates us to collaborate with one another in work
and reason. But [every healthy organism generates energies in excess of
those it needs to maintain itself. **Sovereignty is affirmed not in the
use of these energies but in their intensity**]{.underline}.These
[energies are discharged]{.underline}, imprudently, without calculation,
[without recompense]{.underline}. [Sovereign moments are not achieved
through work and reason; they are without expectation or
hope]{.underline}. "We can in no way fabricate a sovereign moment from a
servile state" (OC 5: 222/US 97).

[Sovereignty]{.underline} does not reign and is and has to be
unrecognized, [hides itself, having nothing that is not ridiculous and
unavowable.]{.underline} The craving and anxiety that compose it are
speechless and appear in common language as dangers. "Sexual pleasure
(which conceals itself and is laughable) comes clos est to the essence
of majesty. Likewise despair. But the despairing one and the sensualist
do not know this majesty they have. To know it would be to lose it" (OC
6: 119/O N 99; tm). "This [sovereignty cannot even be defined as a
good.]{.underline} 1 am attached to it, but would I be if I were not
certain that I could just as well laugh at it?" (OC 5: 222/US 97; tm).

[In sovereign individuals Bataille finds a desire for communication.
Here "communication" does not merely mean having access to other beings
so as to be able to obtain from them the resources we need or the
recognition we crave. That kind of "communication" is only the action
that pursues and ensures self-sufficiency, the isolation of our own---
or reciprocal--- integrity]{.underline}, independence, or egoism. The
deep **[urge for communication is for contact with beings unlike
ourselves.]{.underline}**

The desire for [communication breaks open the self-sufficiency of a
sovereign being]{.underline}, her autonomy, her integrity, and [opens
her upon something beyond her. This beyond is from the first empty; it
is the void, nothingness]{.underline}. She is afflicted with anxiety;
anxiety is the sense of nothing to hold on to, nothing supporting her.
But this anxie[ty is ecstatic, felt in the release of superabundant
energies, and confirms the sovereign intensity of the person who opens
herself to the inappropriable]{.underline}. Out of her own excess
energies the integration and integrity of the sovereign one is
shattered.

[The morality of good and evil subordinates every exaltation to respect
for beings, to concern for the morrow]{.underline}, and for the
endurance of states of being. [In communication the **discharge of
excess energies does not respect the separation of
beings.**]{.underline} If the notion ofgood designates respect for the
space and the integrity, the nature of others and the insurance of
enduring integrity through action, [the sovereign moment is closer to
evil than to good.]{.underline}

**[To communicate with another is to break through his
integrity]{.underline}**, his independence, his autonomy, his nature---
[to intrude upon him, unsettle him, wound him. **Communication takes
place when beings put themselves at risk,** each putting himself and the
other in the region o f death and nothingness. Communication is suicidal
and criminal.]{.underline}

#### Communal laughter can break down rational conceptions of identity in education -- laughter cannot be approached as a tool or as a corporeal dimension, but must be cohered as an affective display of desire and communal emotion. The display of desire in the classroom must take laughter seriously.

**Vlieghe et al 10**, (Joris Vlieghe, Maarten Simons, and Jan
Masschelein, \"The democracy of the flesh: Laughter as an educational
and public event.\" *Philosophy of Education Archive* 2010), p.
204-212)//jh

[Laughter]{.underline} is a marginal topic within educational research
in general, as well as within philosophy of education in particular.
Whenever this subject gets attention at all, it [is commonly
treated]{.underline} either [as a didactic tool]{.underline}, the
benefits or dangers of which are discussed in relation to efficient
teaching, [or as a dimension of corporeality]{.underline}, the absence
of which is symptomatic of an (educational) culture that is marked by a
deep aversion toward human embodiment. [The former]{.underline} analysis
[tends to show that laughter might form an unexpectedly efficient
instrument with which to improve motivation and concentration on the
part of the students]{.underline}, or that it might be a very convenient
aid for explaining abstract concepts. Laughter also improves creativity,
social competencies, and so forth.1 [At the same time, this approach
warns us to use this means with moderation]{.underline}, as laughter
might always degenerate into plain cynicism or moral insensitivity, and
[because laughter has the power to disrupt every hierarchical ordering.
Therefore, laughter could be dangerous within an educational system,
which is supposed to be founded on an unambiguously instituted
discrepancy between those who teach and those who are supposed to
learn]{.underline} (this is why the school and the figure of the teacher
are excellent candidates for objects of scorn and laughter).2 [The
latter approach concerning laughter in education situates this
phenomenon and the aversion toward it in a broader perspective, namely
the endemic hatred of and unmanageable fear for our incarnated condition
as mortal human beings]{.underline}, which is a typical attitude in the
West, dating to the time of Plato. [We envy the immortal gods who are
free from the decay that]{.underline}, being made out of flesh and bone,
[is our inescapable fate. So we]{.underline} eagerly [define ourselves
in terms of "the better part of man," the mind, in order not to be
confronted with the entropic bodies we inhabit]{.underline}. Therefore,
especially in pedagogical contexts, [teachers and students are
encouraged to see themselves as immaterial subjectivities]{.underline}.
As Erica McWilliam argues, there is no place for bodily desire in
classrooms.3 We should keep silent about this feature of the human
condition, although many will (tacitly) admit that the things we learned
that were of the utmost significance for our lives frequently were
provoked by teachers who were not just administrators, but were also
passionate men and women of flesh and blood who had the talent to infect
us in a corporeal way with the yearning to abandon ourselves to certain
subjects. The point is that Western society is not keen on recognizing
this fact. [In the West, we would like education to be a purely cerebral
matter, one that leaves no opportunity for seduction. For the same
reason, it is understandable why we are so repugnant toward laughter:
laughing shatters the illusion we have about our rational
identity.]{.underline}4 [The main aim of this approach to
laughter]{.underline} in education [is to return the body to its
legitimate place within education]{.underline}. Hence those who take
this approach plea that [we should]{.underline} (dare to) [show desire
in classrooms and]{.underline} that we should (dare to)
[laugh]{.underline} --- not in the name of efficiency (as the first
approach claims), but [in the name of a repressed dimension of
humanity]{.underline}. On this view, [laughter is an aspect of our lives
that is disregarded only at a great cost: the loathing of our corporeal
hardware prevents us from becoming fully developed human
beings]{.underline}. What we suggest in this essay is not to discuss
laughter in education in one of [these two ways]{.underline}. In our
view, these approaches [do not take laughter seriously
enough]{.underline}. In the name of ideals such as didactic efficiency
or complete humanity, laughter is treated just as an exquisite
instrument with which to realize these goals. What [we
propose]{.underline} to do, on the other hand, is [to start from the
simple fact that there exists, from time to time, laughter in
classrooms]{.underline}. Our task consists in describing this phenomenon
as accurately as possible in order to show that the experience of
laughter has an educational dimension. [Laughter should not be defended
on the ground that it might be a legitimate and useful instrument. On
the contrary, the experience of shared laughter should be taken at face
value, because --- in itself --- common laughter has a profound
pedagogical significance.]{.underline}

#### Comedic relations between student and teacher can be used to open the classroom to radical transparency that is only able to be reterritorialized by the teacher -- laughter entails 'radical transparency' that gives up on knowing oneself and presents itself as absolute truth

**Vlieghe et al 10**, (Joris Vlieghe, Maarten Simons, and Jan
Masschelein, \"The democracy of the flesh: Laughter as an educational
and public event.\" *Philosophy of Education Archive* 2010), p.
204-212)//jh

Following Georges Bataille 9 and Alphonso Lingis 10 here, [in laughter,
we find ourselves in a state of "radical transparency]{.underline}"11:
we communicate, but not because we share the same insight or the same
language. [People who do not share a cognitive, social]{.underline}
and/[or cultural background might]{.underline} nevertheless [find
themselves sharing in the same experience]{.underline}.12 Furthermore,
[this radical transparency is not a cognitive category: transparency
neither refers to (nor presupposes) a knowledge of the self: "The
opposite of laughter is scrupulous self-criticism]{.underline} --- [that
finger-wagging Socratic injunction: know thyself]{.underline}."13 [It is
the giving up of one's will to have a clear and guaranteed position that
grants the possibility of community-in-laughter]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [while laughing, we are confronted with a truth with which
we cannot argue, which is shown to us as truth. What we experience while
laughing is not something that invites us to search for a further
legitimization of what we feel or to find out whether or not we are
mistaken somehow]{.underline}. "Laughter affirms itself indubitably and
believes in the world illuminated by its delight. That at which and with
which someone laughs is true."14 Laughter is a plain positive reality.
Finally, [the experience of common laughter is also an experience of
equality]{.underline}. In the unintentional surrender to the autonomous
functioning of the body, hierarchical positions are no longer
experienced as meaningful. [The difference between teacher and student,
between adult and child, between judge and criminal, and so forth are
radically suspended. The experience of common laughter grants the
possibility of a form of community, a possibility that nevertheless
might vanish as quickly as it became existent]{.underline}. Referring to
an example given by Bataille, when a student pulls away the chair of her
professor when he is bending to sit on it: "there is the sudden
revelation of an inability to maintain his poise, authority and
seriousness. If we can refrain from laughing, we maintain a position of
power.... However, we lose our seriousness in laughing."15 So, it all
comes down to how we react to the possibility of community that is
revealed in laughing together. In this example, [the professor could
restore as quickly as possible the hierarchical order that he represents
as if nothing had happened. Giving ourselves over to laughter, on the
other hand, implies a break in the course of history. The radical and
unexpected has become a real possibility. In the etymological sense of
the word, this experience of common laughter constitutes an
"e-ducational" event: something happens that has the force to move us
out of position, to lead us out]{.underline} (e-ducere) [of existing
positions into a world in which we are exposed.16 This self-loss and
exposure that one undergoes in the outburst of laughter are not only of
major importance within educational contexts, but are educational in
themselves]{.underline}, precisely [because we give up
mastery-over-our-own-lives and instead experience a sense of
togetherness and equality.]{.underline} When we are confronted with the
automatic and anonymous functioning of the flesh, the kind of community
that might be at stake in education is revealed.

#### Laughter makes a community, defined by lack of commonality other than laughter

**Vlieghe et al 10**, (Joris Vlieghe, Maarten Simons, and Jan
Masschelein, \"The democracy of the flesh: Laughter as an educational
and public event.\" *Philosophy of Education Archive* 2010), p.
204-212)//jh

Now, [it should be clear that the kind of community that is
revealed]{.underline}, for instance, in the experience of common
laughter [is in no way to be considered a product of work]{.underline},
an instrument [which must protect us against some]{.underline}
potentially [private difficulty]{.underline}. [The community-in-laughter
is not a secondary phenomenon that is made meaningful because of some
benefit it brings to the individual]{.underline} (this benefit being, in
both versions of the public just described, the strengthening of the
individual's position upon entering or founding a community). [The
public that is at stake in the community of those who find themselves
together in laughter is, instead, a plain positive reality. It is given
as such in experience and, consequentially, we should take it seriously.
This public is not defined as the "non-private." When confronted with
the involuntary, automatic, and anonymous functioning of the flesh, we
in fact experience a communication that in no way refers to something we
as privatized beings]{.underline} (should) [long for or from which we
need protection, something that cannot be expressed in terms of
interests, goals, or legitimized insights]{.underline} (of individuals).
In contrast with the second version of the public, [this
community-in-laughter is a bond of no one and everyone.]{.underline} It
is "a community [of those who have nothing in common]{.underline}."20 We
simply happen to find ourselves together in laughter, without the
necessity of any shared identity. [In this event, a contingently
gathered "we" shares an experience of loss-of-mastery and equality. As
opposed to the first version of the public, "the democracy of the flesh"
is not about making us visible. It is, rather, about us experiencing
being exposed and thus abandoning our attachments to the individual
positions that the agora should protect.]{.underline} Thus, without
presupposing that there is a common interest, which should grant the
possibility of a "public" experience, the experience of common laughter
shows that, [in the corporeal experience of selfloss]{.underline}
(negatively formulated), [an "intercorporal" community of everyone who
is contingently delivered to the impersonal flesh is
experienced]{.underline} (positively formulated).21 Now, what happens
here could be termed an "e-ducational" event: [through this public
exposure to the autonomous functioning of the body, we come to partake
in a bond in which it has become utterly impossible to uphold neither
any definitive nor hierarchical identity. Experiencing the
community-in-laughter, we are unconditionally out-of-position. This
communizing and equalizing kind of event might just be what the public
vocation of education is all about.]{.underline} Again, [this does not
imply a defense of the position that we should apply more laughter in
classrooms: in that case, we would be using laughter as an instrument
and a weapon --- as a tool that is necessary for the
community-to-be-worked-on. What we might do, instead, is cease to
immunize ourselves against events that happen anyway, such as laughter,
and accept the equalizing and communizing effect of these events. This
presupposes, however, the will to take laughter seriously]{.underline}.

#### Laughter is the revelation that shipwrecks our current horizon of valuation, a form of atheological awakening that destroys God and resists systemic determination. Radically irreconcilable with reason, laughter is an acephalous experience that reveals the ridiculous relativity of everything. 

**Wright 17.** Drew, English Professor at Georgia State University. "The
Impossible Thought off Georges Bataille: A Consciousness that Laughs and
Cries" \| rpadhi

While in London, Bataille had the opportunity to meet renowned
utilitarian philosopher, Henri Bergson, and in anticipation of the
meeting, Bataille read Bergson's 1900 treatise, Laughter. Bataille
described this London rendezvous twenty years later as "the occasion out
of which laughter arose" (IE 66, original emphasis). ["\[L\]aughter was
revelation," Bataille insists]{.underline} in his recounting of the
Bergson encounter in Inner Experience (1943), though this was not the
sort of revelation which may be expected, nor one which Bataille himself
could have foreseen, given his dogmatic inclinations at time (IE 66).
[Firstly, this laugh, though distinctly human, cannot be annexed into
the discrete experience of any respective human subject: this laughter
"belongs" to no one]{.underline} in particular, not even to Bataille.
The "revelation" it "communicates" confirms no "salvation" for the
subject at the mercy of laughter. [Rather, this revelatory laugh "opened
up the depth of things," "a roar of irreconciliation" exposing "the
extreme limit of the 'possible'"]{.underline} (IE 66; Borch-Jacobsen
148; IE 42). [Laughter intuits the abrogation of the "profane" sphere of
the discursive subject, abruptly abolishing all his metaphysical ideals
and utilitarian pipedreams of eventual self-sufficiency.]{.underline}
Rather than the providential "revelation" which would expectedly affirm,
announce, or accompany the subject's dogmatic deliverance unto an
anticipated, presupposed "evasion of the impossible" (i.e.,
"salvation"), [this reverberating revelation shipwrecks the whole
horizon of human valuation, effectively relinquishing "revelation" of
its holy baggage, having turned "salvation" into "the trampoline of the
impossible" (]{.underline}NL 21-3) [This iridescent spell]{.underline},
in whose grasp Bataille would remain perennially caught for the next
forty years of his obsessive intellectual life, [was a "sudden
revelation which revealed the relativity of everything]{.underline}"
(Borch-Jacobson 148). Bataille avows that his unforeseen deliverance
"into a kind of dive, which tended to be vertiginous, into the
possibility of laughter" coincided with the alienation of his religious
allegiances: "at first I had laughed, upon emerging from a long
Christian piety, my life having dissolved, with a spring-like bad faith,
in laughter" (NLT 139; IE 66, original emphasis). Elsewhere, Bataille
maintains that "the first effect" that ensued from his having descended
into "the sphere of laughter" was the swift ruin of the precise
religious faith which "completely animated" him at the time:
"\[E\]verything that the dogma brought me \[was\] carried away by a type
of difluvial flood that decomposed it" (NLT 140). [Laughter was an
atheological awakening:]{.underline} "[Atheology," Bataille explains,
refers to "the science of the death or destruction of God]{.underline}
(the science of the thing being destroyed inasmuch as it is a thing)"
(AFS 167[). This "science," as Stuart Kendall observes, elides the
objectivity constitutive to scientific inquiry, positing in its place "a
science of immediacy," a "science" that disavows the discursive
"discontinuity" between subject and object on which the scientific
method of identification, assimilation, and homogenization is
wholeheartedly staked]{.underline} ("Editor's Introduction" xxxviii).
[Thus, "atheology" is "a science against science, a philosophy against
knowledge"]{.underline} ("Editor's Introduction" xxxviii). [A "science"
or "system" that resists systematic determination, a system of
de-systemization, "atheology" seeks to "create . . . the experience of
the instant"]{.underline} by collapsing the externality posited by the
mediating interventions of discourse, the subject slipping into the
deleterious night of "nonknowledge," into an unmediated, unmitigated
tête-à-tête with death that disallows intermediaries between subject and
object (TD 122). And yet, as Julia Kristeva explains, unlike Hegel,
Bataille refrains from "leaving aside \[the moment of immediacy\] as an
indeterminate nothing, like a simple negation of consciousness and of
the presence of the subject," but rather "he designates its concrete and
material determinations" (BEP 254). Such an "awakening" to the
materiality of immediacy, in effect, embraces a sudden exposure of
consciousness to the death of consciousness, "a consciousness of the
absence of consciousness" (NR 129).Of course, such an "inner experience"
cannot be sustained, nor does it desire to sustain itself, even less to
discipline or enlighten others, for the identificatory integrity of the
subject who would presume to sustain it has been spent. [Laughter is one
among many such distinctly human "inner experiences," "one among many
effusions, one among many deliriums, one among many means to the
impossible"---alongside erotic ecstasy, tears, art, sacrifice---that
attests to immediacy as that which is "essential to
experience"]{.underline} (Kendall, "Editor's Introduction" xxxix; BEP
254). In this thesis, I argue that the meteoric "intimacy" of
atheological consciousness, of this highly contingent "awakening" of
consciousness to the "sovereign instant" of its rifting, finds its
privileged presentation and performance in Bataille's meditations on the
"lived experience" of laughter and, more specifically, in Bataille's
fervent efforts to engage this "lived experience" at the level of
epistemology (AS III 202). Bataille famously self-characterized his own
thought as a "philosophy of laughter," a modality of thought which
allegedly "never proceeds independently of \[the\] experience" of
laughter (NLT cite). [This "philosophy of laughter" receives perhaps its
most confounding---and, no doubt, laughable---articulation in the blunt
coincidence of laughter and thought evinced in a laconic aside Bataille
delivers in "Meditations of Method": "to laugh is to think"]{.underline}
(MM 90). The impossibility of this daft little claim---again, the
"impossible," for Bataille, always indexes "the loss of self"---is
glaringly conspicuous, as this claim presumes an explicit simultaneity
between thought and that capricious spasm that annuls its "exercise" (NL
18). And yet, Bataille's impossible thought---"to laugh is to
think"---insists upon a kind of turbulent awareness at the precise
moment in which the temporal mediations and discursive limitations which
dialectically divide experience into subject -- [object
relations]{.underline} (and thus make self-consciousness possible) [are
sundered, at the moment in which "the exercise of thought" bursts into
the flames of an inappropriable, acephalous experience. It insists upon
an "awakening" to the "impossible"]{.underline} ("the loss of self"), to
what's unthinkable or unknowable about experience insofar as it lies
beyond the boundaries of possibility circumscribed by dialectical
discourse: it insists, in short, upon an awakening to immediacy. [By
peering philosophically (or "reflectively") into the very "blind spot"
of the philosophical gaze, Bataille's "philosophy of laughter" explores
the possibility of "awakening" to the death of consciousness as we know
it, to the possibility of an "awakened" consciousness emerging in a
movement of thought that annihilates it(self)---a consciousness which
laughs and cries.]{.underline} Like Mallarmé's master, or Eliot's
Phlebas, consciousness metamorphoses into something other than itself,
"awakening" to the unlocatable whirlpool into which it drowns,
consciousness itself becoming nothing if not the very vortex whose
riptide floods consciousness with that excess of life which Bataille
calls "lived experience" (or "intimate life") (TR 46). [Bataille's
"philosophy of laughter" evokes a necessarily "impossible" effort to
transfigure epistemological activity into that incendiary "truth of the
universe" which Bataille calls "nonproductive expenditure," an unlimited
movement towards unrestrained loss epitomized by the solar brilliance
whose luminosity interminably boils, void of the purposive
presupposition of returns]{.underline} (DM 67). [Expenditure (qua
unending, unchecked loss) is the ungraspable singularity of experience
which **is radically irreconcilable with the tempering benevolence of
reason, morality, and work**]{.underline}. Denis Hollier explains,
"\[S\]ince expenditure is ultimately the unthinkable par excellence,
thought itself is the suspension of expenditure" (DM 67, original
emphasis). [The "philosophy of laughter," as such, measures up to an
"impossible" attempt to conciliate the operation of thought with what
this operation constitutively "suspends" and with what, in turn, ruins
this operation.]{.underline} It thereby suggests a mode of "reflection"
that shares a profound "intimacy" with what remains and, in a sense,
must remain---"What is hidden in laughter must remain so"--- unknown,
unknowable, even unthinkable about human experience (IE 66). Indeed, in
identifying the movement of thought with laughter's compulsive,
irruptive bursting, Bataille situates thought at precisely the point of
coincidence at which "the exercise of thought" jumps the dialectical
rails on which it routinely rides. As such, the mode of "reflection"
denoted by the designation "philosophy of laughter" amounts to an
epistemological practice whose movement reflects (or seeks to reflect)
its own ontological catastrophe, its own incessant dissolution into the
unthinkable immediacy of experience. [My central assertion in this
thesis is thus that Bataille's "philosophy of laughter" evokes a
privileged, albeit "impossible," effort to convert the acute affective
alterity and unreserved explosiveness of "lived experience" into an
epistemological condition.]{.underline}

#### The criminal and suicidal form of contagious laughter wrecks rationality and exclusionary group identities by posing a threat to the regularity of established order. By revealing our ontological insufficiencies, laughter lacerates us from the profane world of reason. 

**Wright 17.** Drew, English Professor at Georgia State University. "The
Impossible Thought off Georges Bataille: A Consciousness that Laughs and
Cries" \|

Bataille laughs at Bergson---"this careful little man
philosopher!"---for having "instrumentalized" laughter, turning it into
a moral, sociological tool to be deployed for the purposes of adjusting
the "mechanical inelasticity" of one's fellow human, who either slips
and falls or otherwise betrays some psychological or bodily breach in
established modes of behavior (IE 66; Parvulescu 87; Bergson 16). Such
perfunctory transgressions of the accepted order of things, for Bergson,
indicate the possibility of potentially dangerous contradiction or
crime. Anca Parvulescu explains of Bergson: "Laughter is a useful social
gesture, to be used in the formation and reproduction of a group" (87).
Laughter (qua this "social gesture") secures a specific sociological,
moralistic utility and purpose: laughter is the response of a
necessarily closed and limited group, a "social gesture" implying a kind
of "freemasonry," whereby the group reinforces a stable identity by
correcting the automated eccentricities of the falling other (Bergson
16-7; Parvulescu 4-5). [Things could not be more different for Bataille:
laughter, along with erotic ecstasy, wrecks the rational foundations and
exclusionary operations by which we affirm a group identity. It is not
the mechanical slippage of the other which would designate the
potentially hazardous transgression in the laughable scenario. Rather,
it is the burst of laughter itself which poses the threat to the
repressive regularity of established order and civic life.]{.underline}
"The rire \[laughter\]," writes Joseph Libertson, "interrupts the
profane, conservative motivation of thought" (221). [Laughter is
"irreducibly opposed" to discourse, conservation, and work; it is
"essentially non-conservative," useless, prodigal, bastard---a
privileged expression of what Bataille will call "unemployed
negativity"]{.underline} (Parvulescu 81; G 111). [Paradoxically, a kind
of "community" emerges from the epistemological wreckage]{.underline},
though a community not recognizable in any conventional sense of
commonality (i.e., de facto community). [Rather, this community, which
Jean-Luc Nancy calls "inoperable" and Maurice Blanchot "unavowable," can
perhaps best be understood as a community of non-recognition:
"communication" occurs when the boundaries of personal identity are
foregone, when all anticipation and hope "dissolve into
NOTHING"]{.underline} (AS III 208, original emphasis). We "communicate"
in the "sovereign moments" in which our discursive dexterity and its
productive apparatuses fold to the "interrogation" of erotic silence or
to the "contestations" erupting through purposeless, excessive
outpourings of laughter: "lucidity made of incessant contestations
itself, ultimately dissolving in laughter (in nonknowledge)" (G 91).
[This irrepressible "community," wherein we experience the lacerating
"communication" of "the moment of violent contact, when life slips from
one person to another," is a being-in-common defined by the dissolution
of definitions]{.underline} (G 129). [An inner violence or mutilation
(of self) "communicates" the shared experience of human subjectivity's
profound finitude. Rather than serving as a kind of disciplinary
machinery bent on bending bumbling bystanders back into rank (à la
Bergson), laughter (qua "communication") "is criminal and
suicidal"]{.underline}: "All 'communication' participates in suicide, in
crime" (Lingis 122; ON 26, original emphasis). [For laughter (qua
"communication") involves the contagious release or expenditure of
untenable, untamable, unusable energies which imperil the porous
procedures, projects, and performances by which we seek to affirm our
claim to knowledge, self-identification, and self-sufficiency through
the construction and reification of the group]{.underline}. My
interrogation of Bataille's "philosophy of laughter" is rooted in Andrew
Mitchell and Jason Winifree's supposition that "the entire effort" of
Bataillean thought is "dedicated" to the demonstration and delivery of
"the obscure region \[of experience\] closed to phenomenology"
designated by the term "communication" (1; G 212). [This "accursed"
arena of experience corresponds precisely to that which is
incommunicable with respect to articulated discourse insofar as it
involves an experience of consumptive contact whose intensity and
violence rupture the discursive homogeneity of the discrete subject
whose differential isolation (qua "I") guards the possibility of the
articulable acquisition and exchange of material and conceptual
commodities.]{.underline} Critics generally concur that "communication"
and the "contagious subjectivity" (subjectivité contagieuse) of its
nocturnal caress occupy an essential place in Bataillean thought;
however, as Nidesh Latwoo accurately observes, spats abound apropos of
the question of what kind of human subject "informs and underlies this
thought" (73). [I contend that the subject (in both senses of the word)
of Bataillean thought cannot be dissociated from the heterogeneous
subject emergent in the crucible of "communication.]{.underline}"
Writing on the related subject of the matrix of transgression, Michel
Foucault posits "a curious intersection of beings that have no other
life beyond this moment where they totally exchange their beings" (34,
my emphasis). [More specifically, the subject of Bataillean thought is
the subject caught in the "difluvial flood" of laughter's spell, a
subject which, in bursting (into laughter) and therein becoming suddenly
disengaged from the "profane" world of labor, reason, and discourse, is
nothing but this oceanic torrent of lightness in whose high tide of
consumption the subject is awash:]{.underline} "For the subject is
consumption insofar as it is not tied down to work" (AS I 58, original
emphasis). The Bataillean subject, as such, is the contagion of
"communication," and its essential epistemological gesture is to fall
into the excess of laughter. Head thrown back and mouth irrepressibly
agape, the subject of Bataille's "impossible thought" is the spitting
image of impropriety: a subject which is, in a sense, nothing but the
sputtering opening of a mouth that insists on itself (i.e., its
opening), a subject vehemently exposing its own excesses like the
exuberant parting of lips exhibiting fluids, teeth, and tongue. [The
subject shaken in the spell of Bataillean thought would thus appear a
body bound by alterity, held together by a gesticulating choreography of
fragments, an unrecognizable voice, full of sound and fury,
acousmatically rupturing the soundscape while disfiguring the ordered
austerity of the face, body and voice doubling over each other in rabid,
ejaculatory waves that foam over the exorbitantly exposed buccal
recesses, signifying nothin]{.underline}g. "Without any doubt, one who
laughs is himself laughable and, in the profound sense, is so more than
his victim" (IE 97). And, indeed, the spectacle of Bataillean thought
(qua "philosophy of laughter"), undoubtedly ridiculous and improper,
even "ugly," may seem to lack any trace of an affective threat (in
accordance with the Aristotelian model of comedy): that is, this
laughing subject (of Bataillean thought) ostensibly fails to arouse our
more sympathetic sensibilities. Bataille's "philosophy of laughter," no
doubt, results in comedy: [in order to accommodate the irreconcilable
demands of epistemology and expenditure, this method of meditation would
need to embrace a movement simultaneously limited and
unlimited]{.underline}. This comic eventuality, however, is not a fate
to which Bataille is blind: the inescapable failure that awaits such an
intellectual practice cannot have eluded Bataille. In fact, it is
precisely the insufficiency of Bataille's "impossible thought"---the
utter failure of Bataille's articulated discourse to complete the task
of authenticating the substance of what it claims---that energizes this
epistemological caprice. It is through the constitutive inadequacy of
the reasoned utterance to disclose "the impossible," to bring "the loss
of self" into discursive relief, that that which discourse fails to
produce flashes before us: "impossible, yet there it is"---a remark not
without its comic touch (AS III 206, original emphasis). ["Now, to laugh
and to be serious at the same time is impossible,"]{.underline} Bataille
reminds us. "Laughter is lightness, and we miss it insofar as we cease
to laugh at it" (S 73). [That Bataille's discourse on laughter fails, in
this sense, reflects the ontological insufficiency of the labor of human
thought to achieve a consummate state of absolute realization. It is
thus in its failure that Bataille's "impossible thought" succeeds,
revealing (to us/us to) a moment "where life reaches an impossible
limit" (ON 39): namely, when, perceiving this failure, we
laugh!]{.underline}

Gorelick 11 (Nathan, Utah Valley University, "Life in Excess:
Insurrection and Expenditure in Antonin Artaund's Theater of Cruelty",
Pg 270-276)/RF&KV

**[Derrida's elaboration of Bataille's concept of expenditure with- out
reserve provides one potential response to this economy of
signification.]{.underline}** In this context, it is not life, but
**[laughter]{.underline}** that **[renders the totalizing pretentions
of]{.underline}** what Artaud elsewhere calls "**[philo- sophical
systems]{.underline}**" ridiculous. [**The burst of
laughter**, ]{.underline}as far as Bataille's confrontation with
Hegelian systematicity is concerned, **[is the "abso- lute sacri ce of
meaning]{.underline}**: a sacri ce without return and without
reserves";21 [it is the insistence of an excess against which no system
of intelligibility can avail, an avowal of the excess inherent in any
act of signi cation, and an abdication of the will-to-meaning with which
Artaud himself struggled, most famously in his correspondence with
Rivière.]{.underline} Despite this af nity, however, "La parole souf ée"
concludes with an accusation concerning Artaud's seeming complicity with
precisely those metaphysical structures against which both Bataille's
laughter the Theater of Cruelty are supposed to protest. Here, [Artaud's
guration of a theater]{.underline} somehow [sanitized of both repre-
sentation and its attendant commodi cation exhibits, for Derrida, a
misguided or impossible nostalgia for purity of presentation---a
self-destructive fantasy, in other words, of representation without
signi cation.]{.underline} In his slightly later essay on "The Theater
of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation," [Derrida offers a more
sympathetic reading, bringing Artaud much closer to his interpretation
of Bataille's burst of laughter and thus toward a "general economy"22 of
expenditure without reserve.]{.underline} Just as **[laughter asserts a
disrup- tive and unrepresentable force against the incessant production
of meaning,]{.underline}** the Theater of Cruelty is "not a
representation. It is life itself, in the extent to which life is
unrepresentable."23 [If the Theater of Cruelty]{.underline} might still
be considered "work," this [is]{.underline} nonetheless the [work of "af
rmation,"]{.underline} and af rmation is the insistent force of life, of
that [which "produces af rmation itself in its full and necessary
rigor]{.underline}."24 This is not a dialectical af rmation; it does not
invite a negation and an ensuing sublation. Rather, **[it is a permanent
force]{.underline}**, the insistence of **[which refuses systematicity
and thus cannot be con- tained within any system of
intelligibility.]{.underline}** Here, affirmation should be
distinguished not from negation, but from repetition, from the
iterability through which meaning is constituted and maintained within
any signi er, from that which renders representation possible. Artaud
suggests as much: from the perspective of culture-in-action afforded by
the Theater of Cruelty, "\[t\]he library at Alexandria can be burnt
down," since the archiving of knowledge (the condition for the
possibility of its repetition) sti es the creative energy of life (10).
In his "No More Masterpieces," the injunction is even more explicit:
"**[an expression does not have the same value twice, does not live two
lives]{.underline}** . . . all words, once spoken, are dead and function
only at the moment when they are uttered" (75). And since the theater is
the space within which "the menace of repetition" (Derrida's term) nds
its greatest support,25 the radicality of Artaud's af rmation is clear:
rather than abandon the theater to this menace, he insists that "[the
theater is the only place in the world where a gesture, once made, can
never be made the same way twice"]{.underline} (75). The Theater of
Cruelty is therefore theater as cruelty: the expression of life as a
profound, incalculable, lacerating intensity operating at, and defying,
the limits of representation. As with his commentary on Bataille,
[Derrida situates dialectics in this context as "the movement through
which expenditure is reappropriated into presence"; it is the codi
cation of "the economy of repetition" and the "economy of truth" against
which Artaud raises his protest:]{.underline} "Nonrepetition,
[expenditure that is resolute and without return in the unique time
consuming the present,]{.underline} must put an end to fearful
discursiveness, to unskirtable ontology, to dialectics." This new mode
of theatrical presentation must be structurally distinguished from
representation because it "leaves behind it, behind its actual presence,
no trace, no object to carry off."26 Such a formulation clari es
Derrida's earlier elaboration of an art without work while also
partially redeeming Artaud from what at rst appears to be a reassertion
of the primacy of the metaphysics of presence. [Artaud's art is "neither
a book nor a work, but an energy," the expression of which manifests
"expenditure without economy, without reserve, without return, without
history]{.underline}."27 The question of the ef cacy of this art without
work must account for the speci c processes and mechanics by which
modern civilization deploys the recuperative effects of a restricted
economy of meaning[. It is toward precisely this concern that Gilles
Deleuze and Félix Guattari direct their inquiry into the radical
potential of Artaud's concept of the body without organs,]{.underline} a
notion that appeared late in Artaud's life in the controversial radio
play "To Have Done with the Judgment of God." His original formulation
is as follows: [**Man is sick because he is badly constructed. **We must
make up our minds to strip him bare in order to scrape off that
animalcule that itches him mortally, god, and with god his
organs.]{.underline} For you can tie me up if you wish, but there is
nothing more useless than an organ. **[When you will have made him a
body without organs, then you will have delivered him from all his
automatic reactions and restored him to his true
freedom.]{.underline}**28 Here, god and "his [organs" are posed as the
two sources of the indi- vidual's imprisonment,]{.underline} while the
sickness that a body without organs might cure recalls the "horrible
sickness of the mind" about which Artaud wrote more than twenty years
earlier in his correspondence with Rivière. Thus, this provides for
Derrida the rst answer to the question "How will the theater of cruelty
save me?"29 On Derrida's reading, God names for Artaud the structure of
originary theft that operates the economy of representation;
correspondingly, the organ is the gure of the modern civilized subject's
constitution as a mirror image of the language to which it is subject.
[The subject is organ-ized through the labor and play of various body
parts in their differentiation, such that God is precisely the principle
of signifying organization against which Artaud's life revolts. The
theater, then, is the site for the disarticulation and disassemblage of
that subject.]{.underline} **[The hegemony of meaning that operates the
restricted economy of modern civilization will be undermined by a
theater that targets as its enemies the coeval processes of signi cation
and organization.]{.underline}** Deleuze and Guattari take up these two
enemies in this context, as well. The organism---organized and (or as)
articulated---is "a phenomenon of accumulation, coagulation, and
sedimentation that, in order to extract useful labor from the BwO \[body
without organs\], imposes upon it forms, functions, bonds, dominant and
hierarchized organizations, organized transcendences."30 Again, [**the
struggle takes place along the border dividing work, labor, function, or
use, and a freedom from this restricted economy, this imprisonment to
sense**. This is a "perpetual and violent combat between the plane of
consistency,]{.underline} which frees the BwO, cutting across and
dismantling all of the strata \[those forms, functions, and rigid
organizations by which the subject is put to work\], and the surfaces of
strati cation that block it or make it recoil."31 But whereas Derrida
only directly interrogates signi cation and organization as what might
be called two apparatuses of strati cation by which life's excision from
experi- ence is sustained, **[Deleuze and Guattari offer subjecti cation
as a third mechanism of restriction]{.underline}**. Artaud's theater is
thus attributed with an explicitly political or social function: [it is
a strategy of disruption because it is a practice of desubjecti cation,
a means through which life]{.underline}---the mysterious force that, for
Artaud, compels existence---[may be experienced not in its overwhelming
totality, but rather on a "continuum of intensities."]{.underline}32
**[The theater thus gives way to the force of life, but only momentarily
and only through an extremely limiting set of methods]{.underline}**;
thus, in his two manifestos on the Theater of Cruelty, [Artaud outlines
a substantial set of rules that are to be followed in the production of
this theater: spectacle, mise-en-scène, language, musical instruments,
lighting, costumes, the auditorium, objects, the set, the actors---all
are given a form and a rigorous methodology]{.underline} (93--98). This
tightly structured technique is one reason for Derrida's critical
conclusion to his rst essay on Artaud: **[this new metaphys- ics of the
stage reveals a "fatal complicity" with the discourses of modernity, "a
necessary dependency of all destructive discourses: they must inhabit
the structures they demolish.]{.underline}**"33 While his later emphasis
on the incessant af rmation intrinsic to the Theater of Cruelty
complicates this disparaging position, **[Deleuze and Guattari also
recognize that the intensity to which Artaud bears witness cannot be
glimpsed through a total evacuation from the apparatuses of
organization, signi cation, and subjecti cation.]{.underline}** On the
contrary, "\[s\]taying strati ed . . . is not the worst that can happen;
[the worst that can happen is if you throw the strata into demented or
suicidal collapse, which brings them back down on us heavier than
ever."]{.underline}34 It is necessary to maintain "enough of the
organism for it to reform each dawn," and [one must maintain "small
supplies of signi cance and subjecti cation,]{.underline} if only to
turn them against their own systems when the circumstances demand it,
when things, persons, even situ- ations, force you to." Put more simply,
"**[Mimic the strata. You don't reach the BwO, and its plane of
consistency, by wildly destratifying.]{.underline}**"35 Although the
enthusiasm with which he insisted on the **[Theater of Cruelty as a
radical break with the sti ing sicknesses of modern civilization may
distance him from the more moderate position out- lined in A Thousand
Plateaus,]{.underline}** Artaud also understood the political and social
consequences of his counter-representational project. The Theater and
Its Double suggests that it may be incumbent upon the the- ater to
respond to nothing less than the violent or terrifying excesses implicit
within the totalizing systematicity governing our modern
civilization---and thus to frustrate contemporary culture's variously
horrifying efforts to con ne life and all the unruly experience it
enables to a series of manageable calculations**[. A restricted
economy,]{.underline}** as Artaud, Derrida, and Deleuze and Guattari all
note, **[will always be frustrated by the burst of
laughter,]{.underline}** the radical af rmation, **[the very excess of
meaning inherent within any process of signi cation;]{.underline}**
existence will never be contained absolutely.36 Artaud calls this the
"revenge of things" and notes the consequences of this insurrection:
"\[C\]onsider the unprecedented number of crimes whose perverse
gratuitousness is explained only by our powerlessness to take com- plete
possession of life" (9). [The struggle for totalization, absolute
authority, and control nds, in that which exceeds it, a life that
threatens the system and that must therefore be contained---or, what
inevitably amounts to the same thing, destroyed.]{.underline} Deleuze
and Guattari characterize this paranoid reaction of the system
confronted with its own insuf ciencies as "demented or suicidal"; the
extreme violence of which it is capable is therefore anything but
abstract or purely representational. [The catastrophic global
consequences of the culture of modern civilization have all manifested
themselves, paradoxically, in the name of life itself---and the impulse
toward globalized, systematized suicide to which Deleuze and Guattari
give reference has only accelerated since "To Have Done with the
Judgment of God."]{.underline} The task of the Theater of Cruelty is
thus at once terrifying and urgent, and the struggle to awaken the
sleeping intensity of life will be a struggle between art and work,
experience and representation, impossibility and reality. **[If the the-
ater is capable of instantiating the experience of a general economy of
expenditure without reserve, this will not effect an escape from
civilization, but rather will realign civilization and life, so that
"true culture" becomes the expression of the immutable insistence of
life against all attempts to contain its immensity]{.underline}**, its
energy, its cruelty. Conclusion: Contagion In "The Alfred Jarry
Theater," Artaud warns that, "\[i\]f the theater is an amusement, too
many serious problems demand our attention for us to be able to divert
the least particle of it to anything so ephemeral."37 One primary
obstacle to the actualization of a Theater of Cruelty---a theater that
reaches beyond the tepid and irrelevant theater of diversion---is the
"inability to believe, to accept illusion."38 To overcome this obstacle,
**[to experience the force of this theater, is thus to "reestablish
communication with life instead of cutting ourselves off from
it.]{.underline}**"39 In the illusion lies the truth, the truth of a
life obscured by the sedimented detritus of instrumental reason that we
call civilization. [The failure to believe, meanwhile, is symptomatic of
the lifelessness characteristic of our modern cultural
condition.]{.underline} Insofar as a preoccupation with disease
manifests itself through- out Artaud's work, my choice of the term
symptom here is not merely metaphorical. Recall his complaint to Rivière
that "I suffer from a horrible sickness of the mind"; to lm director
Abel Gance in 1927: "I have the plague in the marrow of my nerves and I
suffer from it"; in his "Fragments of a Diary from Hell," "\[i\]t is
this contradiction between my inner facility and my exterior dif culty
which creates the torment of which I am dying"; from a 1932 letter to
the famous acupuncturist George Soulié de Morant, he complains of "total
exhaustion . . . on all levels and in all senses," a "monstrous,
horrible fatigue," and a constant struggle with "manifestly pathological
. . . breaks in thought"; in his notebooks and private papers, [he
alludes to "\[t\]he wound, the dreadful hollowness of the paralyzed
self.]{.underline}"40 All of this speaks not only to Artaud's personal
struggle with madness, but also to the more general struggle toward
which his theater is aimed. **[The inability to believe, as a symptom of
the sickening malaise of modern life, is thus a kind of inoculation
against the life with which Artaud found himself to be
infected,]{.underline}** and with which he wished to infect the world.
He would turn to the sublime destructiveness of the bubonic plague---a
disease that single-handedly eradicated one third of Europe's population
between the thirteenth and seventeenth cen- turies---as a real,
historically concrete manifestation of the radical disruption of which
the theater would be capable were it not for the sti ing sanitization of
experience imposed by a culture intent upon signi cation, organization,
and subjecti cation. We must insist, along with Artaud, that there is
nothing allegorical about this: ["\[T\]he plague is a superior disease
because it is a total crisis after which nothing remains except death or
an extreme puri cation" (31). So, too, with the theater: \[T\]he action
of the theater, like that of the plague, is bene cial, for, impelling
men to see themselves as they are, it causes the mask to fall, reveals
the lie, the slackness, baseness, and hypocrisy of our world; it shakes
off the asphyxiating inertia of matter which invades even the clear- est
testimony of the senses; and in revealing to collectivities of men their
dark power, their hidden force, it invites them to take, in the face of
destiny, a superior and heroic attitude they would never have assumed
without it.]{.underline} (31--32) The task of the theater is thus to
infect modern culture with the immeasurable force of social and psychic
dissolution, with **[the real- ization of its own suicidal incapacity to
contain its irrational excesses: in short, with the contagious energy of
life.]{.underline}**41 This, then, is Artaud's fantasy: "[To describe
the cry that I dreamed, to describe it in living words, with the
appropriate words, and mouth to mouth and breath to breath, to make it
pass not into the ear but into the chest of the
spectator.]{.underline}"42 To give ourselves over, as carriers of this
insurrectionist infection, to the power that only a belief in the
illusion of the theater makes possible is to accept our positions not as
sympathetic critics or passive observers, but as the active
participant-audience, spreading the revitalizing plague of intensity and
excess. **[This implies an imperative to undermine the inoculating
tendencies of modern culture, with its entirely digestive concerns, in
the name of that sleeping intensity.]{.underline}** Once awakened, life
promises to contaminate culture with the profound and cruel insistence
of a hunger without satiation, an af rmation without nega- tion, a body
without organs, an experience without representation. **[If Artaud
imagined that the Theater of Cruelty could cure him of the sickening
demands of signi cation, organization, and subjecti cation, he suggested
as much by insisting that his theater would also cure modern
civilization of its own monstrosity:]{.underline}** "Perhaps the
[theater's poison]{.underline}, injected into the social body,
disintegrates it, [as]{.underline} Saint Augustine says, but at least it
does so as a plague, as an avenging scourge, **[a redeeming epidemic in
which credulous ages have chosen to see the nger of God"
(31).]{.underline}**

#### Laughter is a primary form of mimetic affect that the child is exposed to: it establishes affective channels of communication that prefigure and predate literal or vocal communication -- the joy transmitted through laughter establishes a collective pre-subjective permeability to affective communication. This mimetic interaction brings the subject into a form of permeable, relational being.

**Lawtoo 11**, (Nidesh Lawtoo, "Bataille and the Birth of the Subject,"
Angelaki, Vol. 16, Iss. 2, 2011)/

We were wondering which conception of the subject underscores the
Bataillean model of sovereign communication. [What were the affective
foundations]{.underline} of the ''subjectivite´ contagieuse'' [that
inform]{.underline}s [the]{.underline} interior [experience of
communication]{.underline}, and is [responsible for the affective
transgression of the limits of individuation]{.underline}? A direct
answer, it should be clear by now, can be found in Bataille's reliance
on the nineteenth century Nietzschean model of the reflex unconscious in
general, and on Pierre Janet's psychology of the socius in particular.
In fact, [for Bataille]{.underline}, as for Nietzsche and Janet before
him, [it is because the subject is from the very beginning
open]{.underline}, by reflex, [to the contagious affects of the socii in
childhood, that it continues to remain vulnerable to the transgressive
power of mimetic communication in adulthood. Bataille puts it quite
clearly as]{.underline} he pursues his discussion of what he calls a
''fundamental example'' of communication -- namely [laughter -- and the
affective permeability it generates]{.underline}. [Anticipating
contemporary developments]{.underline} in child psychology, [Bataille
focuses on the newborn's immediate response to mimetic reflexes as he
writes: ''\[a\] child, who is a few weeks old, responding to an adult's
laughter, represents unambiguously the classic example of immediate
laughter'']{.underline} (Hollier, College 107). And he specifies: Now I
will go back to the child's laughter as a basic example \[exemple
fondamental\] of permeability to a common movement. It happens when
faced with adult [laughter]{.underline} \[Il a lieu en face du rire de
l'adulte\]. It [establishes between adult and child a
communication]{.underline} that is [already so profound that it later
will be able to be enriched and amplified by multiplying its
possibilities]{.underline} without its intimate nature being changed.
(Hollier, College 109) For Bataille, then, in the beginning was
laughter. Or, as he will later say, quoting Virgil: ''incipe, parve
puer, risu cognoscere materm'' (V: 389).20 [Initially triggered by the
mimicry of that socius par excellence who is the mother through an
immediate, affective communication based on an involuntary reflex
mechanism, laughter, for Bataille, is the source of a primary,
pre-subjective permeability to the affect of the other/socius, a
contagious, mimetic affect which brings the subject into being as a
permeable, relational, being.]{.underline} At the most general level,
Bataille makes clear that communication with the socius does not
communicate any linguistic message (''there is no pure and simple
communication''), insofar as for Bataille [the affective medium is the
message]{.underline} (''what is communicated is joy'') (Hollier, College
110). [And]{.underline}, as he specifies, [the joy conveyed by the
laughter of the socius establishes a communication]{.underline} ''so
deep'' [that]{.underline} it [paves the way for future forms of
communicative experiences]{.underline}. Moreover, Bataille's implicit
reliance on Janet's intersubjective psychology suggests that the
''subject,'' as it operates in his heterogeneous thought, emerges out of
an affective relation of mimetic communication with another/socius who
is experienced as being both interior and exterior to the subject/ipse.
[Prior to the experience of communication there is, strictly speaking,
no subject to speak of and thus no limits to transgress. The subject
that emerges from the experience of communication is, however, from the
very beginning, permeable to the other -- if only because it is the
laughter of the other that brings it into being]{.underline}. As he will
later put it, ''the happiest laughter is the one that gives birth to a
child'' (Expe´rience 106).

#### The bataillean subject is not formed by idealism but of uncontrollable laughter. Self-recognition is precluded by recognition of the other or the experience of affects received from the socius

**Lawtoo 11**, (Nidesh Lawtoo, "Bataille and the Birth of the Subject,"
Angelaki, Vol. 16, Iss. 2, 2011)//jh

It might be objected that in the context of his discussion of laughter
at the Colle\`ge, Bataille relies on Alexandre Koje\`ve's Hegelian
language of ''recognition'' in order to account for the mimetic relation
between the subject and the socius. Yet, already during this Koje\`vian
period, he makes clear that the child's visual recognition of its mother
is not the condition for an affective communication to take place. On
the contrary, [recognition is but the effect of]{.underline} \[construit
a\` partir de\] [a previous, originary mimetic
affectability]{.underline} \[sentiment e´prouve´\] [that overtakes the
subject immediately, as it is exposed to the presence of a]{.underline}n
''autre/[socius]{.underline}.'' As Bataille puts it, ''[the phenomenon
of recognition will appear to be constructed on the basis of the feeling
of permeability when confronted with an other/socius]{.underline}''
(Hollier, College 109). For Bataille, [the immediacy of mimetic affects
is not only prior to representational distance but is also the necessary
condition for a mediated recognition to take place]{.underline}.21 [The
Bataillean subject does not see the other, and then feel her/his affect;
it feels the affect of the other first, and it is on the basis of this
mimetic experience that recognition is subsequently based.]{.underline}
Nor does the subject have its origin in a complacent feeling of
narcissistic selfsatisfaction at the thought that ''this ideal form is
my ego.'' On the contrary, [laughter, for Bataille, stems from the
subject's affective openness to the contagious communication of the
laughter of the socius which, like an electric current, transgresses the
boundaries of individuation and generates the experience that ''this
mimetic affect is my ego'']{.underline}! [This child does not come into
being by pondering his static mirror-like image, an immobile form
represented to itself from a distance]{.underline} (''I see myself
therefore I am'') [but, rather, experiences, with joy, the living pathos
of the laughter of the socius whose ''expressive exclamations'' tickle
the subject into being]{.underline} (''I feel -- I am''). In short, [the
Bataillean subject is not born out of the spirit of idealism, but out of
an uncontrolled burst of laughter instead]{.underline}.

#### The bataillean subject is a product of laughter that is always capable of becoming-other -- the laughter of the socius opens the subject to future affective channels and prime the subject for encounters-to-come. This original interaction with the previously unknown is what opens the subject to interactions with the socius and establishes a relational model of being that allows the effectuation of the socuis through the subject in the form of affective discharge.

Angelaki, Vol. 16, Iss. 2, 2011)//jh

From laughter to inner experience, via tears, trance, eroticism, death,
dramatization and sacred festivities, [mimesis seems]{.underline},
indeed, [to be at the center of Bataille's]{.underline} persistent
[preoccupation with sovereign forms of communication]{.underline}. As I
have tried to show, [it is only because of the subject's prior
affectability to the contagious affects of the other/socius]{.underline}
who is both exterior and interior to ipse [that the latter remains
permeable to subsequent forms of communicative experience.
Or]{.underline}, if you prefer, [it is because the subject is, from the
very beginning, chained to another subject that such a
magnetic-electric-hypnotic-mimetic current characteristic of sovereign
forms of communication can actually flow]{.underline}. Which also means
that [communication is not only concerned with the dissolution of the
boundaries of the subject, nor with a mystical fusion with]{.underline}
what Bataille calls the ''continuity of [Being'']{.underline} (though it
is both these things), [but also, and perhaps more importantly, with a
reenactment of that very affective process which brings the subject into
being as a mimetic, **relational being**.]{.underline} To be sure,
Bataille does not offer a single, homogeneous answer to the open
question ''who comes after the subject?'' Yet his account of [the birth
of the subject out of the laughter of the socius affirms the emergence
of a modality of being which is always open to the possibility of
becoming other.]{.underline} [The laughter of the socius]{.underline},
in fact, [opens up the channels of affective communication that pave the
way for the subject's future permeability to other forms of mimetic
experiences; these passages also prepare the subject for future
encounters with socii yet to come, with whom the experience of sovereign
communication may, with some chance, eventually be
reenacted.]{.underline} That Bataille could not effectively communicate
these interior experiences on the page is clear. Yet [this impossible,
communicative task did not prevent him from affirming that ''truth is
not where humans consider themselves in isolation: it starts with
conversations, shared laughter]{.underline} \[rires partage´s\],
[friendship, eroticism and it only takes place by passing from one to
the other]{.underline}'' (V: 282; my emphasis). [Bataille's
transgressive, mimetic thought makes the subject continuously slide on
the affective passages that emerge in instants of sovereign
communication with the socii. That is, those ''others'' who are
interlocked with the ''subject'' in such a fundamental way that they
cannot be dissociated from what the subject ''is.'' These socii do not
communicate with me, but through me, because they are already chained
into me]{.underline} -- part of the experience of what Bataille calls,
thinking of Nietzsche, ''[being multiple singular'']{.underline} \[eˆtre
a\` plusieurs un seul\]'' (Sur Nietzsche VI: 279).

#### Laughter transgresses beyond racial boundaries to combat violent hierarchies. 

**Wright 17.** Drew, English Professor at Georgia State University. "The
Impossible Thought off Georges Bataille: A Consciousness that Laughs and
Cries" \| rpadhi

In his essay "An Extravagance of Laughter" (1985), Ralph Ellison
reproduces a vernacular joke, known as the "laughing barrel" joke, that
elucidates the contagion of laughter as mobilizing "the most vicious of
vicious circles" in the context of racial inequality in America (192).
The joke interrogates the dangers of African American laughter
presupposed by the paranoia and prejudice of the dominant white class.
It introduces us to a small town in the American South in which the
rights of African Americans are so suppressed that their right to laugh
in public places has been expressly forbidden, the dominant whites
fearing the potentially threatening contagion of black laughter,
alleging that blacks lack the fortitude to master their emotions. On the
one hand, [this widespread prejudice, espousing the notion that blacks
cannot control their baser impulses, underscores an imperative of racist
white society to prohibit black laughter; however, such a
prohibition]{.underline}, apropos of the very content that emerges from
the racist logic of the town's whites (viz., that blacks cannot control
themselves[), necessarily destines itself to failure.]{.underline} In an
effort to circumvent this impasse, the town devises the ludicrous idea
of placing large wooden barrels bearing the label "For Colored" on
street corners and at all the major thoroughfares. Should a black person
fall into convulsions of laughter, he or she is to place his or her head
inside one of these designated barrels. [Here the peculiar coincidence
of prohibition and transgression comes alive: when, for example, a
laughing black man places his head upside- down in the barrel, his
laughter may intensify, propagate, and redouble as he perceives the
ridiculousness of his own image, inverted in a barrel on the street, his
feet dancing about where his head should be. The laughter reverberating
from the barrel may also catch passing whites in the contagion of its
convulsion, such that figures of authority, such as politicians and
priests, along with blue collar members of the white working class, such
farmhands, and even bootleggers and criminals may all fall into a kind
of volatile "community" with the laughing black man. The hierarchic
class gradations internal to white society as well as those marking
racial boundaries become suspended.]{.underline} And yet,
notwithstanding this relaxation of established social boundaries, the
whites shaken in the hilarity echoing from the barrel occupied by the
black man's laughing head may come to realize or suspect, amidst peals
of laughter, that [the black man in the barrel laughs not solely at
himself, but also at them and at their laughter.]{.underline} White
paranoia about the alleged unruliness of African American behavior and
psychology is relaxed or suspended in a cross-cultural convulsion yet
simultaneously concentrated, reinforced, magnified. [White anxiety about
black laughter and the threat it poses to the racially-stratified order
of things seems to quicken and intensify]{.underline}: whites' attitudes
towards blacks becomes even more obstinate and petulant even as this
quickening of splenetic, racist angst emerges out of a experiential
moment in which the established limits that subordinate African American
life (and laughter) to the moral proprieties of whites bursts, a moment
in which racial and class-oriented societal limits fall away in the
opening of a reverberating space inhabited by a syncopated community of
laughers. [Not only do the measures taken to ensure that the laughter of
the town's black denizens does not disrupt the comings and goings of
town-life fail to prevent such a disruption, but the prohibition against
blacks' laughter is precisely what leads to this disruption and to its
intensification. The prohibition itself sets the stage for laughter to
ensnare both blacks and whites of all classes in a convulsive communal
unity in which the racial paranoia underpinning the prohibition both
unhinges and (re)asserts itself, abolishing and renewing itself---almost
(if not) simultaneously---amid the repetition of laughter's bursts. The
prohibition's intensified (re)affirmation and renewal effectively
coincides with the repetition of a compulsive transgression of the
ordered, racial boundary it outlines.]{.underline}

### Monstrosity

#### The alternative recognizes the violence forces within, the evil lurking within ourselves, and instead of running affirms transgression and self-sacrifice that can live in the moment and find value sans a deferral to future meaning

Georges Bataille.** Few would recognize, in the "depraved ravings" of
this "bad poet]{.underline}," with his fascination for the excesses of
De Sade, with Chinese tortures and other "absurd" phenomena, a
philosopher who might have anything to contribute to [a discussion that
seeks to broaden responsibility and to expunge violences from the human

of hand that could not be accomplished by the reasoning of a
philosophical treatise that must work within the system of signs and
symbols that constitute our "common mental world."]{.underline}**
**[Bataille]{.underline}** **[frustrates]{.underline}** the [**sorting
and distancing mechanism that purifies the home space of alien
contamination by collapsing the logic that underpins the dominating
systems**.]{.underline} It is not simply that Bataille has seen all
along that [the ape's anus is as beautiful as it is
obscene.]{.underline} It is not simply that his fascination with
[transgression has made us wary of the steadfastness of our own moral
and existential borders.]{.underline} It is not simply that [Bataille's
own writing enacts a dissolution of logical reasoning.]{.underline} It
is, above all, that [Bataille's "decadent fantasies" expose the extreme
possibility of human being, a possibility that our purifying logic works
so desperately to conceal]{.underline}---the possibility that, **[at the
core of human desire---the desire shared by all human beings---there
lurks the very monster who, in the conscious moralizing life, we so
starkly condemn in others.]{.underline}** [Bataille reveals the
murderousness that founds all human community when he exposes the darker
dreams that rage in the human breast.]{.underline} In his "Reflections
on the executioner and the victim," a treatment of David Rousset's Les
Jours de notre mort, Bataille notes, with Rousset, the common ignobility
of the [victim and his executioner]{.underline}. These supposed "polar"
entities (victim and executioner) are not "substantial" opposites (not
demon and wretched angel); the two cannot be differentiated in terms of
a difference of essence. Rather, they [are mutually bound in a common
"decomposition of being."]{.underline} [Distinctions can be made only in
terms of the rhythm by which that decomposition proceeds]{.underline}.
Bataille stresses, with Rousset, that **[the great human being
decomposes more slowly, but, ultimately, all are subject to the
certainty of collapse]{.underline}**. However, Bataille wanders farther
from the traditional logic in this essay. It is not simply that each
person succumbs to moral degradation under extremities of suffering and
humiliation (Bataille, 1991, p 18). Bataille recognizes, beyond that
insight, that [abjection takes many forms in a universe so morally
broad.]{.underline} [It is the horror that we find, not at the base of
the sufferer]{.underline} (that he will succumb to the ways of his
abusers[) but at the base of the executioner that is the greatest of
human horrors. **Our most deeply concealed terror lies in the
possibility that, in staring into the abyss of the monstrous other, we
may come to see our own most horrific possibilities**. In forcing us to
gaze into that abyss, Bataille raises the possibility that each of us
shares, with the torturer, the rage that fires his craft---his love for
inflicting pain upon others]{.underline}. [This possibility
seems]{.underline} "inhuman" but, rather, asserts Bataille, [as "limit"
to the "human," it fully delineates what marks out the human as
such.]{.underline} **[To define the limiting possibilities is to locate
the definitive parameters of our kind.]{.underline}** "[Our possibility
is not simply pain," insists Bataille, "but it extends to the rage of
the torturer]{.underline}" (Bataille, 1991, p 18). **[The possibility of
me as the enraged torturer, exemplifying the full "decomposition of
being," exposes the essential character of all "human"
being.]{.underline}** It exposes the ontological fact that the good
victim is simultaneously the "evil" and "monstrous" torturer. **[At the
extremities of my own possibilities, I find myself as executioner,
alongside all the monsters of human]{.underline}** **[history, at home
in a "common mental---if unconscious---world" of desire that delights in
the suffering of others]{.underline}**. **[This shocking truth
communicates the utter banality of evil]{.underline}**. [The most sacred
of home spaces shares, at least to some degree, with the Third Reich and
the kingdom of Genghis Khan, an allotment of the senseless rage of the
torturer, an entirely "human" rage that dwells on the cusp of the human
condition]{.underline}. **[And it is only in facing that truth, in
accepting the monstrous as an altogether "human" potentiality, that
"reason becomes an insoluble question for itself." With the "awakening"
of our reasonings to self-question, human beings may stand capable, at
last, of overturning the logic that permits the facile moral judgments
and the clear condemnations that effect "an escapist
denial."]{.underline}** [This "awakening" tears us from the logical
possibility of the sorting and distancing mechanism that **expiates our
violences by projecting them onto a sacrificial other.**]{.underline}
Conclusion: from [scapegoating]{.underline} to the examined life Burkert
has shown that polar characterizations that rest upon clear [and
distinct oppositions are the legacy of a violent human
past.]{.underline} [That logic lingers in the seriousness with which we
carve out our loyalties in the world, the sacredness we attribute to our
home spaces, and the disgust and fear we experience in the face of the
alien]{.underline}. **[Bataille proposes that flesh is the most
fundamental terrain of violence.]{.underline}** **[His "indecent"
fantasies mock the claim that all home spaces are sacred, clean and
pure. He undercuts the scapegoat mechanism by fashioning us all, on the
deepest level, demonic, if only in potency.]{.underline}** [Bataille
refuses the contaminating principle of an endemic disfigurement effected
from without.]{.underline} For him, [the extant order's dualistic logic
is absurd, just as is the reality of human connection an
absurdity---beyond clear and distinct meanings]{.underline}. **[As
Bataille vomits forth his mutinous writing, contradictory and
overexposed, he acts out a revolution within that very
order.]{.underline}** Bataille's [literary excesses expose the only
"truth" of the human world---that it is metaphysically
rapacious]{.underline}. His wild musings are so fully embellished, so
genuinely utterly absurd, as to supplant any posited sense of the
absurd**[. With his meaningless festivals of bodily mishap, agony,
perversion and orgy defy the claims of "innocent sanctity" by which
existing socio-moral orders define themselves.]{.underline}** **[He
exposes, in his excesses of cruelty, that violence is always already a
predictable element of orders per se]{.underline}**. [Bataille unveils
the cruelty of the polite human world, a cruelty whose fleshy
palpability is only superficially shrouded by a false politeness, a
politeness making even more cruel its inherent cruelties.]{.underline}
In exposing the outrageous disorder fundamental to our ordered worlds,
**[Bataille raises the possibility that the individual might see beyond
his "sacred" spaces, and break free of the systems in which she figures
only as a link in the chain of species violences.]{.underline}**
Furthermore[, his theater of violences opens the possibility of
alternatively configured relations between human fellows, beyond the
coalitions forged through mechanisms of rejection. His meditations on
cruelty illustrate, if scandalously, that, while suffering bodies are
individual, they invite a fraternity on the]{.underline} [basis of
collective vulnerability]{.underline}. **[All bodies potentially suffer.
Each individual's agony is a potential for everyone else]{.underline}**.
Exposing the fact that the real world is not so very different from his
theater of the absurd, Bataille exposes that nothing whatsoever fits
neatly into the "two containers"---all is gray zone, that is. The logic
of counter-cultural rejection holds that truth at a comfortable
distance, locating the dis-ease in difference, then marginalizing it and
demonizing it. But [who is not the different? Are we not all
Armenians?]{.underline} And, then, [are we not all Hitlers?]{.underline}
**[Recognizing the violent forces that are at work in any culture,
recognizing our deepest concealments of our own violational tendencies,
recognizing that the more passionately "moral" we are, the more we are
enslaved to the demonizing logic, recognizing that the more ordered and
"legitimate" the system, the more wounding it is likely to be toward the
non-belonging---these re-cognitions]{.underline}** ("awakenings" of
reasoning) **[can help us to overcome our tendency to channel chaos onto
the marginal or expel it upon foreign bodies, and they can help dispel
the willed oversights that claim sacred purity for our own home
spaces.]{.underline}** Monsters, as unspeakable objects of dread,
function as extremes of human difference that reconfirm all systems, and
reinstate the legitimacy of those who belong, and thus they reconfirm as
rightful the violences visited upon those oppressed by the system. If we
take to heart the warnings in the theories of Burkert and the other
anthropologists, we find that **[the domain of violence coextends with
the over-determined assembly of powers and forces that configure "human"
language, consciousness and culture. There exists no purified realm cut
loose from the orchestrations of power;]{.underline}** cultures'
linguistic and social terrain is coextensive with the monstrousness it
condemns. Ordering systems not only suppress and regulate violence; they
comprise it. [Social structures, mechanisms of control and order and
organization and orientation not only define the marginal chaotic---they
produce it!]{.underline} **[Prohibitions increase the fear and sense of
powerlessness from which burgeon hysterias for
cleanliness.]{.underline}** These [hysterias are manifest in the frantic
moralizations that flood the public sphere]{.underline}. We see them in
the rage surrounding [bids for capital punishment]{.underline}, in the
frenzied [denouncements against]{.underline} child molesters,
[abortionists]{.underline}, terrorists, etc. We see it in over-serious
[nationalisms]{.underline}, tribalisms and religious
[fundamentalisms]{.underline} that flood the globe. [Guilt or innocence
of the crime is beside the point in theatricalized condemnations of
anti-social behaviors.]{.underline} It is the [**condemnations
themselves that depend on a sustained and orchestrated refusal to
recognize that violence---evil---is not external to the social fabric
but constitutive of it.** Tracking down the sources of endemic evil in a
society, whether by police or intelligence agency, neighborhood "watch"
or lynch mob, involves pinpointing the exact location, spatial but also
psychological, tribal, racial, religious and/or gendered, that
designates the precise parameters of guilt to permit the required
catharsis]{.underline}. **[Ideologies of exposure thus are essentially
ironic, functioning as a cleansing that is simultaneously and equally a
contamination]{.underline}**. The "good" citizen as much as the

### Nonknowledge

#### Our process of nonknowledge is a squandering of the basic ideals of the educational systems. We instead affirm the complete unmeasurability that comes with nonknowledge and the possibilities or non possibilities that it brings as a form of thought play

**Lerman'15 --** Lindsay Lerman -- University of Guelph Philosophy
Department, Graduate Student. Studies Epistemology, Georges Bataille --
"Georges Bataille's "Nonknowledge" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open
Economy of Knowledge" pg 30-32 KZaidi

Our [explanation of nonknowledge takes place in four major
sections]{.underline}, each of which is an "element" of nonknowledge.
They are: **[unstable communicability]{.underline}** (element 1),
**[experientiality]{.underline}** (element 2), **[threshold
position]{.underline}** (element 3), [and **expenditure**]{.underline}
(element 4). [Each of these four elements]{.underline} (with the
exception of element 3) [contains a number of "features" that flesh out
the element.]{.underline}

[The features of element 1 (unstable communicability)]{.underline}
collectively [point to the larger claims that there is something in the
experience of nonknowledge that does not comfortably or clearly **reduce
to language**, that **language can fail** in significant ways, and that
experiences of nonknowledge cannot be propositionalized. The features of
element 2 (experientiality) highlight its subjectivity and affectivity,
its transgressive nature, and its seemingly **paradoxical property of
leading both somewhere and nowhere.** That nonknowledge has no authority
other than itself is also emphasized in the features of element
2]{.underline}. The third element ([the threshold position]{.underline})
differs from the others because it does not have a number of features,
and it is not described in Bataille's texts. The "element" [is in fact
my claim about the nature of nonknowledge and its position in relation
to the kind of knowledge sought by the virtue epistemology conversation,
made explicit through Bataille.]{.underline} Element 4 is [expenditure.
The features]{.underline} of element 4 [stress the **unmeasurability**,
partial uselessness, and destructive facets of nonknowledge. They also
stress the non-acquisitive nature of nonknowledge]{.underline}---that as
[expenditure, it is not clearly creditable, and thus **cannot be
acquired and stored up.** Nonknowledge is thus a kind of
thought-play.]{.underline}

Today, like other times, I am going to attempt to communicate my
experience of nonknowledge to you. Of course, like the other times, I
will fail. But first I would like to show you the extent of my failure.
I can say precisely that if I had succeeded, the tangible contact
between you and me would have the nature not of work but of play. I
would have known how to make you perceive what is for me a decisive
fact; the only object of my thought is play, and in play my thought, the
work of my thought, is annihilated (USN 120).

Drawing this out will require explaining all four elements of
nonknowledge.

We can already see that [the features of the four elements of
nonknowledge are significantly different from the presumptions made in
the virtue epistemology conversation. Taking these differences seriously
and making them explicit is the chief aim of this document.]{.underline}
By the end of this document, however, I will argue that [we can see
these elements and features of nonknowledge at play in the virtue
epistemology conversation, and that nonknowledge can in fact be seen as
a feature of knowledge-creation of the kind we see in the virtue
epistemology discussion, as an expression of classical epistemology, and
of philosophy.]{.underline}

I will argue additionally (in chapter 3) that [nonknowledge is best
understood as "**epistemic expenditure**]{.underline}," and as [an open,
or general, economy.]{.underline} Building on this, I will return to the
[virtue epistemology conversation in order to claim that what at first
looks like a closed, or restricted economy]{.underline} (viz., the
virtue epistemology conversation) [is in fact an open, or general
economy, with nonknowledge (understood as epistemic expenditure) already
occurring within it. This claim requires some additional
claims.]{.underline} I will identify them here before discussing them
fully in the coming chapters. [They are: (1) that the virtue
epistemology presumptions are an adaptation to the excess, the waste,
that is nonknowledge; (2) that the elements of nonknowledge occur in
virtue epistemology, without being recognized]{.underline} or
identified; and thus (3) [that what the classical presumptions suggest
is the entire story---or a complete conversation---is in fact an
incomplete story, or conversation.]{.underline}

#### Nonknowledge is the threshold at which knowledge is exhausted or recognizes its limits. Understanding it is not a matter of finding where knowledge becomes nonknowledge, but is the moment at which we are faced with something that we cannot think or know. This is not the end of our ability to think, but is instead a threshold to a new way of thinking or understanding.

\"Nonknowledge\" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open Economy of
Knowledge," 8/04/15)//jh

Element 3: Threshold Position "[Bataille envisages the arrival of
thought at]{.underline} the gates of [nonknowledge]{.underline} only [to
the extent that thought would have exhausted its
'resources']{.underline}" (Robert Sasso, "Georges Bataille and the
Challenge to Think," On Bataille 47). "One side of nonknowledge is
chaos; the other, system. Knowledge forms a bridge between the two
banks. [Knowledge]{.underline} as such [is a space of
transformation]{.underline}" (Michel Serres, The Parasite 73) [The
position of nonknowledge in relation to knowledge is what I call a
"threshold position." Important to its threshold position is the "non"
in "nonknowledge." It is not a "non" in the sense of negation or
opposition.]{.underline} Ray Brassier has described what he calls the
"non-philosophy" of François Laruelle in just such a way, akin to the
"non" in "non Euclidean" geometry: \[...\] not as a negation or denial
of philosophy, but as suspending a specific structure (the philosophical
equivalent of Euclid's fifth axiom concerning parallels) which Laruelle
sees as constitutive of the traditional practice of philosophy. New
possibilities of thought become available once that structure has been
suspended and non-philosophy is an index of those philosophically
un-envisageable possibilities ("Axiomatic Heresy: The non-philosophy of
François Laruelle," Radical Philosophy 121, p. 25). If nonknowledge were
"a-knowledge" it would be the absence of knowledge. If it were "ir
knowledge" or "un-knowledge," it would be the negation of knowledge.
Sticking with the Latin roots, nonknowledge is closer to
"not-knowledge." But this cannot mean that nonknowledge is strictly
not-knowledge. The relationship of nonknowledge to knowledge can be
explained with Bataille's description of what makes excess possible:
"\[O\]nly the impossibility of continuing growth makes way for squander.
Hence the real excess does not begin until the growth of the individual
or group has reached its limits" (Accursed Share 29). At full epistemic
capacity, what could have been useful intellectual activity becomes
excessive, wasteful intellectual activity. [Nonknowledge is thus not
ignorance or total absence of knowledge, but a challenging not-knowing
that occurs at a limit---at the continuous and permanent threshold
of---knowing. Because in the next chapter we will see that I am calling
nonknowledge epistemic expenditure, I maintain that its most easily
identifiable incarnations occur when a limit in thought, in thinking, in
problem-solving---in]{.underline} 88 "[useful" mental activity---is
crossed]{.underline}. When thought has "exhausted its resources," (Sasso
ibid) pushed past a limit of usefulness. [Nonknowledge is thus an
alternate epistemology]{.underline}. Following the "non" of Laruelle,
nonknowledge makes "new possibilities of thought" available (Brassier
ibid). Bataille did not identify nonknowledge's position as a threshold
position, but he did lay the groundwork for my description. According to
Bataille, nonknowledge occurs as a natural, necessary byproduct of the
dissolution of knowledge (AC 74), which itself occurs at the height of
knowledge, only when the "summit" of knowledge is reached (ibid).
\[K\]nowledge leads to the limit, because knowledge as a willful
comportment is motivated by a relation to the limit. Just as the
interdit called for transgression, through an intimate accord hidden
within its illusory opposition, knowledge calls to non-savoir as its
violent complement, its hidden condition, its silent end. 'The
nonessence of the will to know arises': it is not reason that motivates
the desire to know---no more than it was reason that instituted the
interdit. [The desire to know is violent---is violence]{.underline}
\[...\] [It is an exigency conditioned by survival and by death. It
leads]{.underline}, through its privileged illusion of objectivity and
the possession of truth, [inexorably to its limit. The experience of
this limit is non-savoir]{.underline}" (Joseph Libertson, "Bataille and
Communication," On Bataille 217). [Limits]{.underline} can be
thresholds. Instead of being final, they [are thresholds---a permanent
zone of openness to transformation]{.underline}. [What we are capable of
doing is not]{.underline} once and for all [determined]{.underline}. We
can experience a limit as a final limit---a necessary
stopping-point---or [we can see if the limit is not perhaps as final or
as real as it seems]{.underline}. [Understanding]{.underline} that
[limits]{.underline} are thresholds is the key. This is a
quasi-Deleuzian point. "Deleuze has an almost mathematical definition of
the limit, [as that which one never really reaches]{.underline}.56"
(Rosi Braidotti, "The Ethics of Becoming Imperceptible," Deleuze and
Philosophy 10). Thus [understanding]{.underline} the position of
[nonknowledge]{.underline} in relation to knowledge [is not a matter of
determining exactly where knowledge "ends" and nonknowledge "begins"; it
is a moment when we are faced with something unthinkable, unknowable,
un-communicable, or even heretical, and it is a matter of understanding
that moment not as a final marker of a limit, but as a
threshold]{.underline}. As somewhere between clear thought or discourse
(that which can be clearly, reliably communicated, translated into
knowledge, or seen as a contribution to the accepted scholarship) and
something like a-knowledge or un-knowledge: a wild and entirely
indescribable terrain. [When we have utterly exhausted or clicked off
our thinking and knowing resources, we begin to arrive in the region of
nonknowledge]{.underline}. We've seen that this is perhaps uniquely
possible in erotic experience, but it is not limited to thinking or
knowing during, or about, erotic experience. Nonknowledge can occur when
we are wondering about the structure of the universe. It can happen when
a child asks us what time is. Certain events or experiences can occasion
nonknowledge, but they are not the form of nonknowledge. [In keeping
with the threshold position of nonknowledge, we will see that it is a
part of knowledge and knowledge-creation, despite the fact that virtue
epistemology]{.underline}---and epistemology in general---[seeks
to]{.underline} strictly [limit what kinds of processes or procedures
can result in knowledge, and thereby excludes processes that might be
nonknowledge]{.underline}. (And thus cannot ever really or fully be
excluded.)

#### Nonknowledge is the wasteful expenditure of thought -- it is thought-play rather than thought-work. This expenditure is un-recoverable, wasted through self-destruction in opposition to a general economic approach to life as scarce as opposed to abundant.

\"Nonknowledge\" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open Economy of
Knowledge," 8/04/15)//jh

Chapter 3: Nonknowledge is Epistemic Expenditure "The sacred is par
excellence the sphere of 'La Part maudite' \[...\], sphere of
sacrificial expenditure, of wealth and of death; sphere of a 'general'
economy which refutes all the axioms of economy as it is usually
understood \[...\] It is also the sphere of non-knowledge" (Jean
Baudrillard57). Introduction This chapter is an argument and an
explanation. Firstly, it is my argument that [nonknowledge is an
essentially expenditure-related concept, and that it is because
nonknowledge is expenditure that nonknowledge can be a feature of
knowledge-creation.]{.underline} That is, this chapter is an argument
that [nonknowledge should be understood primarily as an instance or
example of expenditure, and thus, as a positive term with a positive
definition.]{.underline} (As an "open" or "general" economy of
knowledge.) Building on this, I will argue in the next chapter than [an
understanding of nonknowledge as (epistemic) expenditure makes possible
an understanding of nonknowledge as productive of
knowledge]{.underline}. In order to make these arguments, however (and
secondly), we need to examine the most significant element of
nonknowledge---expenditure---and we need to do so while continually
returning to the virtue epistemology conversation for points of contrast
and clarity. Expenditure will turn out to be the most significant
element of nonknowledge because [nonknowledge itself is an act of
expenditure]{.underline}. [Nonknowledge is thought-waste or mental
energy-expenditure. It is thought-play rather than
thought-work]{.underline} (USN 129). Nonknowledge is pseudo-knowledge
partially outside of---and with a complicated relationship to---utility.
[And expenditure is waste. It is not total or complete waste, but it is
the act of wasting something and thereby removing or displacing
it]{.underline} (at least partially) [from economic
utility]{.underline}. The claim that nonknowledge is an act or example
of expenditure is a claim I make explicit through Bataille58.
[Nonknowledge is thus best conceived of as an "economy." That is, this
epistemic, general economy is best made visible by seeing the
conversation in our virtue epistemology cluster, by contrast, as a
restricted economy driven by accumulation]{.underline}. Element 4:
Expenditure, "General Economy" A note on the relationship between
expenditure and "general economy," a term I (and others) use in this
chapter: [General economy is a "principle." The chief principle of
general economy is that there is always excess]{.underline} (The
Accursed Share vol. 1 pp. 21-3). This excess is [wasted through
destruction (of itself).]{.underline} In fact, [excess is necessarily a
byproduct of growth, and excess must be destroyed and/or "not used."
When limits to growth have been reached, the excess must be destroyed.
This is the basic ontological principle of general
economy]{.underline}59. "The general economy, in the first place, makes
apparent that excesses of energy are produced, which by definition
cannot be utilized." ("Méthode de Méditation, Oeuvres Complètes 5, 215).
Bataille is not claiming that there is only excess with regard to the
human population or a particular currency; his use of "economy" refers
specifically to the interaction of forces and energies within a
particular realm, and that realm is global60: "On the surface of the
globe, [for living matter in general, energy is always in
excess]{.underline}" (AC 23; emphasis Bataille's). [The global nature of
the principle of general economy]{.underline}---that there is always
excess---[does not allow for general economy to be pigeonholed as a
principle applicable only to human reproduction and population-growth,
for example]{.underline}. The ontological principle of general economy
is that there is always excess, for all living matter61. Arkady
Plotnitsky calls general economy a "theoretical framework" as well as a
science (Complementarity 19). As a theoretical framework and a science,
[general economy is a way of understanding the world. It contains the
notion of expenditure. A restricted, or closed, economy]{.underline}, by
contrast, [is driven by a logic]{.underline} of scarcity, by the
principle [that the basic condition of life is not excess but
scarcity]{.underline}. It is "predicated on the notion of a primal
scarcity and the necessity to produce and accumulate in order to
safeguard against this scarcity that perpetually threatens existence. It
corresponds to economy viewed from the perspective of fear and anxiety"
(RBN 6462). So we find two sorts of economy in Bataille's writing:
restricted (or closed) and general (or open). Feature 4.1 (of
Expenditure): Non-Productivity [General economy and expenditure are
closely linked. Expenditure operates in the mode of general economy---or
according to general economy. Unproductive expenditure]{.underline} --
characterized by unrecoverable loss, as Bataille calls it -- [is similar
enough to be sometimes inseparable from the notion of
"sacrifice]{.underline}."63 [Unproductive expenditure is
non-teleological.]{.underline} Unproductive expenditure is not
applicable "the modes of consumption that serve as a means to the end of
production" (ibid). With this, Bataille means to claim that unproductive
expenditure is unproductive, and it is unproductive in many senses.
"\[L\]uxury, mourning, war, cults, the construction of sumptuary
monuments, games, spectacles, arts, \[and\] perverse sexual activity"
are modes of activity that stand in contrast to productive modes in
economy, politics, religion, and interpersonal relations. Bataille is
claiming that unproductive expenditure happens. Bataille is not yet (in
1933) making claims with regard to the value of unproductive
expenditure; he is claiming that unproductive expenditure happens. He
calls it "pure loss." [Something escapes productivity and is a loss to
the system---an "accursed" loss: "that extra thing---that accursed
share--- that never bows down to the yoke of utility]{.underline}"
(Winnubst RBN 7-8). Bataille begins "The Notion of Expenditure64" (1933)
with the following: [Human activity is not]{.underline} entirely
[reducible to processes of production and conservation, and consumption
must be divided into two distinct parts. The first, reducible part
is]{.underline} represented by the use of the minimum necessary for the
conservation of life and the continuation of individuals' productive
activity in a given society; it is therefore [a question simply of the
fundamental condition of productive activity]{.underline}. [The second
part is represented by so-called unproductive expenditures]{.underline}:
luxury, mourning, war, cults, the construction of sumptuary monuments,
games, spectacles, arts, perverse sexual activity (i.e., deflected from
genital finality)---all these represent [activities which, at least in
primitive circumstances, have no end beyond themselves.]{.underline} Now
it is necessary to reserve the use of the word expenditure for the
designation of these unproductive forms, and not for the designation of
all the modes of consumption that serve as a means to the end of
production (VE 118). Loss that is unrecoverable is loss that cannot be
reinvested in order to produce value or meaning. The peculiar loss
involved with expenditure is loss that cannot "serve as a means to the
end of production" (ibid). Loss that is temporary and recoverable is not
unproductive expenditure; it is temporary loss that can be reinvested in
production, value, or meaning. We see highly recoverable and
re-investable loss in Las Vegas, for example, where the businessman goes
for a wild weekend in order to return to work refreshed and productive.
This is a temporary indulgence in expenditure for soon-to-be-recovered
personal gain.

#### Nonknowledge functions as epistemic expenditure -- it allows for mutual recognition of communicative failure through experiencing it. It is a form of epistemic play that makes knowing possible through providing spaces to exercise thought outside of utility or productivity. It takes as its opposite thinking, communicating, and totally knowing what is known

Knowledge," 8/04/15)//jh

Nonknowledge as an "Open" or "General" Economy How is nonknowledge an
"open" economy? [Nonknowledge is an "open" economy because it is
epistemic expenditure.]{.underline} Nonknowledge occurs [at a limit of
thought, as excess, and it is destructive of knowledge]{.underline}. In
Bataille's early writing about expenditure (roughly 1927 1939),
nonknowledge is not mentioned, so the relation nonknowledge has to
expenditure is not yet clear in Bataille's texts. Denis Hollier,
however, links expenditure and nonknowledge in the entirety of
Bataille's oeuvre. In "The Dualist Materialism of Georges Bataille,"
(Bataille: A Critical Reader) Hollier writes that Bataille's unification
of "thought (la pensée) and its expenditure (la dépense)" is a
fundamental part of Bataille's desire to challenge the dualism of
knowing and doing, a desire found throughout Bataille's work (66). "It
is a strange relation which ties together these two worlds \[thought and
expenditure\] with no common ground, whose unthinkable and impossible
coexistence cannot be described in terms of an addition or a totality,
never amounting to a total" (ibid). Nonetheless, the "two worlds" united
by a "strange relation" must be understood not as a duality but a
pseudo-unity requiring tension and "an ever unresolved dissatisfaction"
(ibid 61). The "unresolved dissatisfaction" must exist because thought
and expenditure are "radically incompatable," in the face of their
pseudo-unity (ibid 67). Hollier's position brings to mind the unresolved
dissatisfaction which is a necessary part of communicating nonknowledge,
and the failure that is part of communication. ("This is also the
profound meaning of nonknowledge. One must cease knowing (speaking) in
order to experience" (USN 239); "Through language we can never grasp
what matters to us, for it eludes in the form of interdependent
propositions, and no central whole to which each of these can be
referred ever appears" (E 274).) Regarding thought and expenditure, my
claim is that [nonknowledge is the pseudo-unity of thought and
expenditure]{.underline}. Comparing nonknowledge to Zagzegski and Sosa's
conceptions of knowledge, [the expenditure aspect of
nonknowledge]{.underline}---the wasteful, useless, work-annihilating
aspect---[is arresting]{.underline}: [Today, like the other times, I am
going to attempt to communicate my experience of nonknowledge to you. Of
course, like the other times, I will fail. But first I would like to
show you the extent of my failure. I can say precisely that if I had
succeeded, the tangible contact between you and me would have had the
nature not of work but of play...in play, my thought, the work of my
thought, is annihilated]{.underline} (USN 129). [This is how we can
understand nonknowledge as epistemic expenditure, and thus as an "open"
economy of knowledge and a kind of alternate epistemology]{.underline}.
Nonknowledge is thought-play that is partially destructive of
thought-work. Recently, I saw this in action. I was watching my two and
half year old daughter Sabine play. She had skinned her knee the day
before. She was fascinated with the scab on her knee, and the band-aid
that covered it, and how my parental affection had been different or new
to her as I helped her clean the wound the day before. And this day, she
was caretaker to her stuffed animals, telling me they had all hurt their
knees, and they were crying, and she was helping them. As she played,
being every version of a doctor or caretaker she could be, I
realized---suddenly, almost stupidly---this form of play is the only way
she can learn, how she can figure out, after the fact, after
recuperation from the experience, what an injury is, what care is, how
injuries elicit certain kinds of care, and who knows what else. The
[childish play is]{.underline} precisely [the thing that is making
knowledge possible]{.underline}, in this case. But the elements of
nonknowledge are not a- or anti-epistemic. We see in the quote above
that Bataille believed that [nonknowledge as thought-play has something
to offer]{.underline}, that [it could show us how to think outside of
the "work of thought"; that is, outside utility, production, and
acquisition]{.underline}. Such [play]{.underline}, however,
"[annihilates" work. Thus thinking, knowing, and communicating what is
known in a threshold, "alternate," "open" position is destructive of the
work-like aspects (production and acquisition) of thinking, knowing, and
communicating what is known.]{.underline}

#### Nonknowledge is unmeasurable and intoxicatingly meaningless -- through the wasteful expenditure of thought, nonknowledge reveals that meaning has no value. Its goal is not the accumulation of meaning but instead total expenditure and sacrifice for its own sake.

**Lerman 15**, Lindsay, PhD in philosophy from the University of Gough,
studies Bataille and Epistemology, ("Georges Bataille\'s
\"Nonknowledge\" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open Economy of
Knowledge," 8/04/15)//jh

Occurring at a limit of knowledge, [nonknowledge is destructive of
knowledge and some senses of meaning, particularly
measurability]{.underline}: "The ultimate problem of knowledge is the
same as that of consumption. [No one can both know and not be destroyed;
no one can both consume wealth and increase it]{.underline}" (The
Accursed Share vol. 1 74). The destructive and unmeasurable aspects of
nonknowledge become clear visible we consider nonknowledge in the
context of general economy. General economy "accounts for or relates to
the operation \[...\] of loss and expenditure" (Plotnitsky,
Complementarity 21). That is, loss and expenditure are internal to and
part of general economy. Recall that [general economy and expenditure
are not the same (despite the former "containing" or "accounting for"
the latter), but]{.underline} that [they are also not easily
separable]{.underline}. [One constitutive feature of general economy,
and thus of expenditure, is that it is not "predicated on the value of
meaning"]{.underline} (C 21). [A "restricted" economy]{.underline}, on
the other hand, "be it Adam Smith's, Hegel's, or Marx's, [would still be
predicated on the value of meaning, and particularly conscious
meaning---meaningful investment, meaningful expenditure of labor and
capital, meaningful production and conservation]{.underline}" (ibid
20-1). Plotnitsky is here speaking specifically of political and fiscal
economies, but he is clear that [the designation "general economy" can
apply to any economy, including epistemic ones]{.underline}. Similarly,
Rodolphe Gasché claims that we can understand an "economy" as productive
of meaning within a particular discourse: "We have to understand
'economy' here as an organization of the relation of forces that produce
meaning within a discourse" (Georges Bataille, Phenomenology and
Phantasmology 15). Our concern is the difference between two kinds of
economy on offer: a restricted, closed economy and a general, open
economy. If a "restricted" economy is "predicated on the value of
meaning," and a general economy is not, expenditure becomes a
particularly important element of general economy: [it is the action (or
"movement") that embodies useless loss, without regard for meaning of
the loss. Expenditure is the means by which "the value of meaning" is
shown to have little or no bearing on the functioning of general
economy. In this regard, expenditure is the key to general economy and
its unique property of not being "predicated on the value of meaning."
Nonknowledge and expenditure share this feature.]{.underline} Like
expenditure, [nonknowledge is a loss of value of meaning]{.underline}.
Like expenditure, nonknowledge is not "predicated on the value of
meaning." Nonknowledge does have affective meaning, as we saw in chapter
two (Feature 2.7 of Experientiality: Meaning in Affect). [The meaning
found in nonknowledge is an "intoxicating" nonmeaning, understood in
positive terms as an affective meaning with no clear goal]{.underline}
(ON 173). [Nonknowledge thus resists teleology]{.underline}. Supporting
this, Plotnitsky claims that "value" measured in terms of "meaning" is
teleological analysis67. Recall Bataille's assertions that nonknowledge
doesn't "lead anywhere" (ON 172-3), and that inner experience is a
"struggle against the spell in which useful language holds us" (USN 16).
These are two of the ways in which nonknowledge resists teleological
analysis and measurement qua knowledge or truth-bearing. [Nonknowledge
cannot be measured, tracked, or accounted for---assigned a value based
on its meaning---in ways we see, for example, our virtue epistemology
conversation measure, track, and account for]{.underline}. Greco offers
a clear example: On the approach I prefer, knowledge is to be understood
as true belief grounded in intellectual virtue, where an intellectual
virtue is understood as a reliable cognitive ability or power. This
approach is a version of reliabilism, since it understands knowledge as
true belief produced by a reliable process. But the approach places a
restriction on what sort of reliable process can give rise to knowledge.
Namely, only those processes that are grounded in the abilities or
powers of the believer do so ("Virtue, Luck, and the Pyrrhonian
Problematic" 27). The measurability and accountability of a belief and a
believer's cognitive makeup is key to Greco's account of knowledge.
Meaning must be clear. Beliefs and a believer's cognitive makeup must
submit to teleological analysis via clear meaning (in the form of
measurability and accountability). Zagzebski presents us with a
similarly measurable account of knowledge: My proposal, then, is this.
An epistemic agent gets credit for getting a true belief when she
arrives at a true belief because of her virtuous intellectual acts
motivated by a love of truth. She gets credit for getting a desirable
true belief when she arrives at a desirable true belief because of acts
motivated by love of true beliefs that are components of a good life
("The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good" 24). The value assigned
to both beliefs and believers is dependent on the discernable---
trackable, measurable---motivations of the believer(s). [The unit of
measure in virtue epistemology is thus utility, which can only be
determined via the particular accountability required of intellectual
virtue.]{.underline} In relation, then, to Plotnitsky's assertion that
general economy---and with it expenditure--- is not "predicated on the
value of meaning," [nonknowledge is an essential example of
expenditure]{.underline}. As expenditure, [nonknowledge too has a
relationship to the value of meaning that challenges the assumption that
all is "predicated on the value of meaning.]{.underline}" Not only is
nonknowledge not "predicated on the value of meaning"; as a kind of
expenditure, [nonknowledge is not predicated on
measurability]{.underline}. I am extending Plotnitsky's designations of
"value" and "meaning" in the case of nonknowledge to include all metrics
other than the utility discussed directly above. That is, the dual
utility that (in part) makes knowledge possible. But because
nonknowledge is expenditure, it is not predicated on measurability. I
have to stress once again that nonknowledge is not a total absence of
knowledge, or, in experiential terms, it is not an experience which
makes knowledge-gathering and measuring forever impossible. [An
important part of nonknowledge's threshold position is its relation to
meaning: meaning is not nonknowledge's primary orientation or goal.
Nonknowledge is not wholly goal-less, but as expenditure, its only
observable outcome is expending, wasting, or sacrificing, not for the
purpose of establishing or discovering meaning, but for the purpose of
expending. This is why nonknowledge cannot be continuously accumulated
or stored up. Nonknowledge is an expenditure of individual and
collective mental]{.underline} (intellectual) [energy---undirected
mental activity]{.underline}. I take "intellectual" here to mean the
complex suite of general activities of the intellect, including
thinking, pondering, wondering, remembering, problem-solving,
connecting, orienting, understanding, etc. I do not use "intellectual"
activity as it is scientifically defined or demonstrated: synapses
firing and connecting, areas of the brain lighting up on fMRI scans,
etc. Undirected mental activity could be wondering, or day-dreaming, or
absentmindedly remembering, but it matters less what form it takes and
more that it is a state, and an experience, not bound to and by utility.
Nonknowledge is (at least in part) the experience of expending
intellectual energy without return. Expenditure without return is by
definition separate from meaning-driven experience. Lee writes: "from
the point of view of general economy, it becomes clear that some
entities must be placed outside the sphere of utility, that is, there
has to be exuberant spending" (RBN 246). Nonknowledge is just such an
exuberant spending that cannot be measured according to a metric such as
"value" or "utility" or "meaning." Nonknowledge is outside the "sphere
of utility"---not entirely outside---but at least partially outside.
This does not make nonknowledge or anything else outside the "sphere of
utility" special; in fact, it is far from "being a special mode of being
that belongs to entities when they are no longer useful"; exuberant
spending is rather "the necessary condition of life, and, consequently,
of utility" (ibid). And [nonknowledge occurs at a limit of knowing---as
the exuberance of knowing---not before knowledge in some perfect
ignorant state. Nonknowledge thus opens onto an alternate epistemology
as an open, general economy of knowledge.]{.underline}

#### the expenditure and loss inherent in nonknowledge is meaningless, but can be channeled towards destructive ends. The goal is to use a small amount of expenditure and let the rest be destructive in its creation of further modes of knowing. Nonknowledge is a prerequisite to any knowledge.

Limits and Destruction "\[G\]eneral economy must always take into
account "the loss in representation and knowledge" (C 30). However:
[nonknowledge is not merely a "loss in representation and knowledge"
such that the possibility of knowledge or some amount of knowledge is
suddenly popped out of existence in an experience of nonknowledge;
nonknowledge is the dissolution or destruction of actual
knowledge]{.underline} (in the moment of nonknowledge), [and the
interruption or dissolution of the dream of un-ending knowledge in the
face of knowledge's limit]{.underline} (AC 73-4). "[Un-ending
knowledge]{.underline}," in this instance, [is]{.underline} knowledge
[predicated on the value of meaning; utilizable and capable of being
accumulated because of the meaning it offers]{.underline}. [Nonknowledge
makes visible]{.underline} the impossibility of perfect utility and
expenditure---[the loss that cannot be explained in terms of
meaning.]{.underline} But recall that [some excess can and ought to be
"channeled]{.underline}"---[in a particular way]{.underline}, a
particular way [that we may not have seen yet]{.underline}. Allan Stoekl
writes, 'Bad duality,' as I crudely put it, is the indulgence in
expenditure out of personal motives: to gain something for oneself
(glory, social status) or for one's social group or nation (booty,
territory, security). [From the chief who engages in potlatch, all the
way to the modern military planners of nuclear war---all conceive of a
brilliant, radical destruction of things as a useful contribution: to
one's own standing, to the position or long-term survival of one's own
society]{.underline} (RBN 268). [The proper goal, then, is to channel or
use some expenditure, and to allow the rest of the expenditure to be
destructive. And of course some "channeling" might also be destructive.
Nonknowledge as expenditure means nonknowledge as destructive but
potentially useful in particular ways: the creation of
knowledge.]{.underline} Exuberant spending being "the necessary
condition of life" (Lee, RBN 246) means that [nonknowledge is the
primary "necessary" intellectual squandering of intellectual energy
without return]{.underline}. Just as exuberant spending is the necessary
condition of utility, intellectual squandering or exuberance
(nonknowledge) is the necessary condition of utility in the sphere of
knowledge. According to this formulation, [nonknowledge is a necessary
condition of knowledge]{.underline}. We turn to this final claim---that
nonknowledge is already internal to and primary for knowledge---now in
the fourth chapter.

### Pedagogy of Excess

#### We should prefer a pedagogy of excess as modeled after the Paris protests in '68, focusing on student-developed curriculum, collaborative acts of intellectual enquiry, and connecting students to radical political history -- this allows students to act as a producer, defying the current consumerist and marketised model of education. 

**Neary and Hagyard 11.** Mike Neary is the Dean of Teaching and
Learning at the University of Lincoln and he was the Director of the
Reinvention Centre, reputed for its radical pedagogical experimentation.
Andy Hagyard is an Academic Development Consultant at University of
Leeds. "The Marketisation of Higher Education and the Student as
Consumer", Pedagogy of excess: An alternative political economy of
student life \| rpadhi

[The pedagogy of excess is based on the premise that re-engineering the
forms in which teaching and research are configured in universities has
the potential to transform the nature of higher education in ways that
undermine the current consumerist and marketised model.]{.underline} The
mainstream literature on the relationship between teaching and research
at the undergraduate level is limited in scope and ambition, restricted
to an orthodox pedagogic agenda involving the training of students as
researchers or to enhance their enterprise and employability skills
(Healey and Jenkins 2007). Where the writing on this subject extends
beyond these restrictions it is limited to students solving problems to
deal with the complexities of modern life (Brew 2006; Barnett 2000). [In
order to fundamentally challenge the concept of student as consumer, the
links between teaching and research need to be radicalised to include an
alternative political economy of the student experience. This
radicalisation can be achieved by connecting academics and students to
their own radical political history, and by pointing out ways in which
this radical political history can be brought back to life by developing
progressive relationships between academics and students inside and
outside of the curriculum.]{.underline} A review of the mainstream
literature reveals that where writing on this topic does engage with
more radical historical and political issues, for example Elton's
engagement with the writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767--1835), the
political implications of this engagement are not fully developed. The
implications are that the laissez-faire liberalism that underpinned
Humboldt's political project to create the University of Berlin in 1810,
if carried through by contemporary universities, will make the
appearance of the student as consumer more rather than less likely. Is
it possible to create a radical pedagogy based on the links between
teaching and research to counteract the identity of the student as
consumer? [A radical pedagogy can be designed around another version of
student life, based on events in Paris, France in 1968.]{.underline} By
making connections between the university and its own political history,
and by developing a pedagogy that connects teaching and research at the
undergraduate level, it is possible that a radical new pedagogy might
emerge. [It is the possibility of this new radical pedagogy that is
described as a pedagogy of excess. The essential aspects of this
pedagogy of excess are that students can be enabled to transcend the
constraints of consumerism by overcoming the limits of what it is to be
a student in higher education. They can do this through collaborative
acts of intellectual enquiry, working with academics and with each
other, on subjects that look beyond their own self-interest and identity
as students. This academic activity can include exploring the origins of
-- as well as progressive responses to -- the general social crisis out
of which the attempt to reduce students to the identity of consumer is
derived. This pedagogy of excess can only be sustained within the moment
of a real political history]{.underline}. The pedagogy of excess emerges
in a period that has seen strikes by academics and students around the
world against the proposed marketisation of their higher education
system (Klimke and Scharloth 2008). [The pedagogy of excess does not
look for a repeat of 1968, but seeks to develop a critical academic
project that builds on the radical political history of the university,
inside and outside of the curriculum -- in and against the current
version of higher education.]{.underline} Literature review The leading
advocate of connecting research and undergraduate teaching was Boyer
(1990) who conceptualised the relationship between teaching and research
in terms of what he referred to as the scholarship of teaching and
learning. This concept of scholarship has been taken forward by
Griffiths (2004) and Healey and Jenkins (2007), among others, who have
designed scholarly-based pedagogic models organised around the
teaching-research nexus which they refer to as research-based learning.
Connecting teaching and research at the undergraduate level is now
regarded as the essence of student centred-ness (Ramsden 2001), an
important strategy in preparing students for the 'knowledge society'
(Scott 2002) as well as for devel- oping the qualities of professional
expertise among undergraduates (Weiman 2004; Brew 2006). At the same
time, linking teaching and research in the undergraduate curriculum is
seen to have the potential to promote inter-disciplinarity, and to
challenge fundamentally the meaning and nature of research (Brew 2006).
[Where the evidence for the effectiveness of linking teaching and
research stretches beyond the acquisition of academic and professional
skills, research-based learning is seen as a way of providing students
with problem solving and coping skills for a complex world]{.underline}
(Barnett 2000; Brew 2006). Evidence for the effectiveness of connecting
teaching and research at the undergraduate level continues to emerge in
an increasing body of work, e.g. Pascarella and Terenzini (2005), Baxter
Magolda et al. (1998), Healey (2005) and Healey and Jenkins (2007).
However, the potential for further pedagogical advances, grounding
research-based learning in the political history of higher education,
remains undeveloped. This lack of engagement with the political history
of the modern university is surprising given the prominence in the
literature to the work of Wilhelm von Humboldt, the political
philosopher and educationalist. Humboldt is widely credited as having
established the first modern European university in Berlin in 1810 on
the principle of connecting teaching and research. A notable exception
to this lack of political engagement is found in the work of Lewis
Elton. Elton's writings and translations have been important in
promoting the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt in relation to the
historical development of university education in Europe. Elton uses
Humboldt's work as a way of arguing against the increasing interference
in higher education by successive governments. Elton maintains that
government interference is likely to endanger the future of universities
in the UK and in Europe (Elton 2008a). For Elton, as for Humboldt, the
key to limiting state interference and promoting the interests of
universities is the promotion of scholarship, and key to the promotion
of scholarship is the way in which research and teaching can be
connected in higher education. Following Humboldt, Elton argues that
research and teaching are to be joined in a process whereby students
work together with academics in the service of scholarship (Elton
2008b). Elton does not fully develop the political implications of the
points he is making, limiting the discussion of Humboldt's notion of
scholarship to recent advances in managerial science, and to integrating
research-based learning into professional staff development programmes
(Elton 2008a and 2008b). Humboldt's political philosophy An
understanding of the implications of Humboldt's political philosophy
requires an engagement with his book The Limits of State Action (1852).
In this book Humboldt sets out the basis for his commitment to an
extreme laissez-faire philosophy (Humboldt 1993 xlix--lvi). For Humboldt
political philosophy was based on 'the proclamation of complete
self-sovereignty of the individual' or 'extreme individualism' (Knoll
and Seibart 1967: 17--19). The state was to have no positive role in the
area of social welfare, but was a necessary evil whose role is to
protect its members from external threats: every effort by the state to
interfere in the private affairs of the citizens is to be 'absolutely
condemned' (Humboldt 1993: 16). Neither was the state to have any
influence on education, which was to be a private rather than a public
affair: public education was to lie wholly outside the limits within
which the state should exercise its effectiveness (Humboldt 1993: 52).
While working for the Ministry of Education in Prussia Humboldt had to
temper his thoughts on public education, but he did not wholly abandon
his reservations about the state and, with regard to his university
reform, devised a model with considerable autonomy (Knoll and Seibart
1967). Humboldt's impeccable liberal credentials make him no figure on
which to base a critique on the concept of student as consumer. [At the
core of liberal theory lie the fundamental principles of consumerism:
the concept of the individual freedom and pursuit of self interest in a
context which promotes the self organising nature of markets and
denigrates state intervention. Schemes based on liberal social theory
are, therefore more likely to move higher education further in the
direction of marketisation]{.underline} (Zizek 2009). In order to
develop a critical account of the student as consumer it is necessary to
look elsewhere into the historical and political development of the
modern university. 1968: the poverty of student life [A more progressive
basis for the development of a radical pedagogy that engages critically
with the concept of the student as consumer can to be found in the
history and politics of the global student protest movement of 1968 and,
in particular, in Paris, France in May of that year. Although the
student protest in France began in the universities of Nanterre and the
Sorbonne, it quickly spread to include not only students but academics
and workers, across the whole of France. The protest by the students and
workers was not in response to an economic crisis, but was a reaction to
the general crisis in French society as a whole, expressed in a variety
of political, economic and cultural forms. These forms included a lack
of democratic accountability in the universities and the national
political system, an alienating technological and bureaucratic form of
capitalism, and a culture of anti-war protest against French colonialism
in Algeria and American imperialism in Vietnam]{.underline} (Ross 2002;
Gilcher- Holtey 1998; Quattrocchi and Nairn 1998; Seidman 2004; Singer
2002). [Within the French universities this was experienced as an
abundance of ennui and 'the poverty of student life'. The protest
movement culminated in a general strike, which almost destroyed General
De Gaulle's government and very nearly succeeded in creating a new form
of society]{.underline} (Ross 2002; Gilcher-Holtey 1998; Quattrocchi and
Nairn 1998; Seidman 2004; Singer 2002). The revolt was eventually
suppressed but the pro- test has left a controversial legacy about its
nature and significance. This legacy has been the subject of much debate
among sociologists, historians, anthropolo- gists, biographers and
autobiographers around a series of issues that are pertinent to the
pedagogy of excess (Gilcher-Holtey 1998). These issues include the
relationships between the student and the teacher, the relationship
between intellectual and manual labour, the relationship between the
student movement and other social movements and the relationship between
the university and its external environment. At the centre of these
issues lies the question about the representation and production of
knowledge, raising the question about the nature and role of the
university, suggesting that a new form of university is possible based
on the principles of democracy, self-management and social justice[. A
key issue for the protest was the way in which the students engaged with
the critical social theory within which the events were
conceptualised]{.underline}. In France, and throughout Europe, the
protests coincided with the emergence of a radical critique of orthodox
Marxism based on previously unpublished versions of Marx's own work and
other subversive versions of Marx's social theory that had been
suppressed throughout the twentieth century. Key among these critical
theorists was the existential Marxist humanism of Sartre, whose work
reinserted human agency (praxis) against the crude materialism of
structural Marxism (Fox 2003: 19), promoting a 'humanist philosophy of
action, of effort, of combat, of solidarity' against 'the quietism of
despair' (Sartre 1966, cited in Fox 2003: 16). For Sartre human
existence is constituted 'out- wardly by its engagement and actions in
the concrete world' (Fox 2003: 16). [The students were inspired by the
work of Walter Benjamin (1934) who expounded a radical theory of action
and engagement based on the radical cultural movements of Dadaism,
Surrealism and Russian Constructivism. Key to these critical cultural
activities was involving the consumer in the process of production:
where the reader becomes the author and the audience becomes the actor,
not only as the producers of artistic content, but as collaborators of
their own social world, as subjects rather than objects of
history.]{.underline} Henri Lefebvre, a professor in Nanterre during the
protests, argued for the recovery of the concept of 'everyday life' as a
critical and theoretical category, currently constituted by the
'bureaucratic society of controlled consumption' and experienced as
boredom and banality (Lefebvre 1984). [For Lefebvre the revolution must
transform everyday life as well as the social relations of production.
He argued that the irreducibility of human subjectivity is the key to
revolutionary action. The impulse for progressive political activity was
to be found in the human attributes of creativity and desire, expressed
as what he described as 'poesis', i.e. resistance to the alienating
consequences of modern consumerism]{.underline} (Hirsch 1982). In The
Society of the Spectacle (1970), Debord argued that the social world had
been overwhelmed by capitalist relations of production, and that direct
experience and the determination of real events had been reduced to the
passive contemplation of everyday life (Jappe 1999). Debord and his
collaborators in the Situationalist International, of which he was a
founding member, argued in favour of direct action through the creation
of situations which would reveal the absurdity of everyday life. These
spontaneous political protests would be supported by local
worker-student councils which would 'transform the totality of existing
conditions' so that students and workers could 'recognise themselves in
a world of their own design' (Debord 1970: para 179). What all of these
writings have in common is the application of Marxist social theory to a
committed and concrete political action, against the condition of
consumerism and the commodification of everyday life. What is remarkable
about the events of May 1968 is the ways in which this theory was
realised in practice. Action committees: poesis in motion May 1968 was a
moment in which everything happened politically (Ross 2002: 15) -- an
event that was pregnant with a new sense of 'creative political capacity
in France and elsewhere' (Ross 2002: 18). There was a feeling that
'politics is -- everywhere and everything' (Quattrocchi and Nairn 1998:
123), especially in education. [Within the universities self-managing,
democratic, non-hierarchical groups, known as Action Committees, were
established]{.underline} (Posner 1970; Ross 2002; Seale and McConville
1968[). These committees comprised of between ten and fifteen members,
academics and students, initially for dialogue and discussion, promoting
'constant criticism and self discovery' so that 'the movement was able
to constantly radicalize itself']{.underline} (Posner 1970: 47). The
committees went on to occupy campuses across Paris and France. The
Action Committees coordinated demonstrations and demands, and made
contact with the workers and other grassroot protest movements,
dissolving the separation between workers and intellectuals through
expressions of solidarity and the provision of information through
various forms of creative political art, music and drama (agitprop). The
aim of the Action Committees was to abolish the current autocratic, non-
democratic, industry-focused structure of universities with a system
based on democracy and social justice (Ross 2002). But, if the movement
was defined by its theoretically informed organisational forms,
something even more significant was occurring. Ross (2002) points out
that the really transforming aspect of the protest was that the
participants did not perform the roles that had been accorded to them by
sociologists, journalists, historians and politicians, i.e., those who
defined the events of May 1968 as a 'student protest'. The significant
point, argues Ross, is that the students refused to act as students:
'[In the so called "student action" students never acted as students but
as revealers of a general crisis, of bearers of a power of rupture
putting into question the regime, State, society']{.underline} (Blanchot
1998, quoted in Ross 2002 p25). [This refusal to act as students was
compounded by the students' refusal to speak about student issues,
choosing only to speak about 'common affairs']{.underline} (Ross 2002:
118), [raising the protest to the level of society. As Badiou describes
it, the events of 1968 were 'something that arrives in excess, beyond
all calculation . . . that proposes an entirely new system of thought'
and which 'led infinitely farther than their \[the students\] education
. . . would have allowed them to foresee; an event in the sense of real
participation . . . altering the course of their lives']{.underline}
(Badiou 1998, quoted in Ross 2002: 26). Indeed this appears to contrast
sharply with the media representation of students by Williams (Chapter
13) that sees students positioned as largely passive to societal issues.
Key to the notion of revelation was the way in which knowledge about the
events of May 1968 was to be produced, reported and recorded. [Those
involved with the struggle maintained that research should begin from
contestation and revolt. In this way they aimed to break with the
tradition of academic elitism so as to produce knowledge in a populist
and highly accessible style]{.underline} (Ross 2002: 117). [This radical
way of producing knowledge and presenting information was to be a form
of 'direct communication' providing 'a new means of comprehension
between different groups']{.underline} (Ross 2002: 114[) so as 'to give
a voice to those without voices' and to contest 'the domain of the
experts']{.underline} (Ross 2002: 116). In this way those engaged in the
struggle sought to demystify the process of research. For the students
and the workers 'We are in our way researchers, but this is work that
anyone can do' (Ross 2002: 118). [A key means of dissemination of
critical ideas was through graffiti art:]{.underline} Plagiarism is
progress, history demands it Boredom is counterrevolutionary Be
realistic, demand the impossible We work, but we produce nothing. A
pedagogy of excess The events of 1968 have had a profound effect on the
development of higher education in France and around the world. The
post-1968 period saw the emergence of a new form of university:
democratic (Scott 1995), postmodern (Lyotard 1979) and multiverse (Kerr
1963). The key feature of this new type of university was that
universities had now become sites of contested space, not only for the
control and management of the higher education, but in relation to the
meaning and purpose of knowledge itself (Delanty 2001). [A central facet
of the post-1968 period was the development of progressive pedagogies in
higher education based on 'left wing ideas', reflecting the radical
political agenda that had been established by the students in Paris. Key
to these developments was the **engagement of students in the design of
curricula**, including deciding on the content of courses as well as
forms of assessment; and, through the proliferation of independent study
programmes, a recognition that under- graduate students were capable of
creating knowledge of real academic content and value]{.underline}
(Pratt 1997). [In the period since then university administrators and
politicians have struggled to de-politicise the radical substance of
these pedagogical initiatives, while at the same time contain and pacify
students and academics through the imposition of increasingly managerial
and bureaucratic strategies]{.underline} (Zizek 2009). Readings (1996)
maintains that the concept of 'excellence' is the revenge of the
university bureaucrat for 1968. [The events of 1968 provide a powerful
historical and political framework within which to **re-conceptualise
the relationship between teaching and research in higher education in a
way that offers a challenge to the notion of student as consumer and the
politics of marketisation**.]{.underline} The problem is how to recover
the radicality of the 1968 agenda in the current contemporary crisis. [A
progressive way forward is to connect current pedagogies that link
teaching and research with their own radical academic history, and to
develop them in a form that is appropriate for the contemporary
situation. Key to this issue of connectivity is the relationship between
action and progressive political theory. It is the relationship between
theory and action, linked to contemporary struggles within higher
education, that provides a framework for the emergence of a pedagogy of
excess.]{.underline} Action Key to the development of a pedagogy of
excess is that [during the struggles of May 1968 the students exceeded
their role as students -- they became the revealers of a general crisis
in society, and the personification of the ways in which that crisis
might be interrupted and reconsidered, calling into question the
principles and protocols through which the social was organised and
controlled]{.underline}. In the process the students moved beyond the
limits of where they might have expected their experience of university
education to have taken them, exceeding their expectations about the
potentials and possibilities of student life. Through the reengineering
of research and teaching at the undergraduate level, considerable
advances have been made in developing a progressive agenda for students
in ways that take them beyond the mainstream student experience.
[Through the process of real collaboration with academics the role of
student as consumer is challenged, reinventing the student as the
producer of knowledge of real academic content and value]{.underline}
(Neary and Winn 2009). [The strength of this approach is that the
**student becomes the student as producer rather than student as
consumer**, but in the mainstream model the student is still confirmed
as a student.]{.underline} The extent to which these collaborations move
beyond the mainstream teaching and learning agenda depends on the extent
to which the politicised nature of higher education is made explicit,
and [the ways in which the knowledge that is produced is contextualised
politically, as well as theorised critically.]{.underline} Teaching and
learning is made political when it is based on an agenda of contestation
and struggle rather than the managed consensus of university
bureaucracies, calling into question not just particular aspects of
teaching and learning in higher education, but the nature and purpose of
higher education itself. For a pedagogy of excess these contestations
and struggles might include course content, assessment strategies and
student fees, but [a fully developed pedagogy of excess would look
beyond student issues, to matters of more general social concern,
'common affairs', in which the interests of students are not the main
issue.]{.underline} The extent to which these forms of collaboration
extend into projects that attempt to reveal the origins for the general
capitalist crisis is a matter of negotia- tion between the students and
their teachers, but clearly a framework can be established within which
these revelations can occur. [This framework might be extended to become
the organising principle for the institutions of higher education as a
whole]{.underline}. Theory: alternative political economy What was
learnt from 1968 is that practical action is made dynamic when it
connects to social theory. In this context the theory of excess becomes
an antidote to the concept of consumerism and a guide to social action.
The concept of excess as critical political intervention has its roots
in sociology (Bataille), anthropology (Mauss), and Marxist social theory
(Debord). [If con- sumerism is based on the economic theory which
demands that individuals act rationally and in their own
self-interest]{.underline} (Fine and Milonakis 2009), [the category of
excess is offered 'as an alternative to the rationalist calculation of
capitalist exchange']{.underline} (Kosalka 1999). The concept of excess
was most developed in the work of [Bataille]{.underline} (1991), who
[offered the notion of excess as an alternative framework to the
capitalist basis of exchange, replacing what he regarded as a
'restrictive economy', with a 'general economy'. For Bataille this more
general economy would provide a humanistic and non-utilitarian basis for
the organisation of modern society. For Bataille the key to the
organisation of any society was the way in which it dealt with the
surplus that had been produced.]{.underline} Anthropology (Mauss 1922)
had revealed the ways in which non-capitalistic societies distributed
their surplus on the basis of generosity and abundance, as gifts,
promoting a sense of social solidarity through sharing, with an emphasis
on collaboration and consensus. [Acts of extravagant generosity afforded
status and respect to the person who was doing the giving; and, as the
gifts that were being distributed were often intimately connected to the
person who was doing the giving, generating feelings of personal
satisfaction and self worth.]{.underline} These acts of extravagant
giving created a sense of obligation on the part of the recipient,
leading to bonding between individuals and groups. This process of
excessive distribution is contrasted with the consumerist exchange
process of capitalist society which is characterised by dissatisfaction
and alienation. [This promotion of acts of extravagant generosity might
seem somewhat utopian in the context of the modern social world.
However, this process of exchange described by the concept of excess is
instantly recognisable as being at the core of the academic
enterprise]{.underline} (Fuller 2002). The practice of academic excess
has been given further impetus by online computing through, for example,
the free distribution of teaching and learning materials on the World
Wide Web, defined as Open Educational Resources (Iiyoshi and Kumar
2008). [A pedagogy of excess would seek to promote and develop these
activities as a counter to the economistic and market-driven restrictive
practices that increasingly dominate the activity of scientific
enquiry.]{.underline} However, what the politics of student protest has
taught us, during and post 1968, is that [radical consumption is not
enough: the transformation of capitalist social relations lies not
simply in the politics of consumption, but the politics of production,
which, as the revolutionary social theory of the period
demonstrated,]{.underline} can be found in the theory against capitalist
work elaborated by Marx in Capital and the Grundrisse (Debord 1970). The
essence of Marx's revolutionary theory of production lies in his theory
of surplus value (excess) which provides the conditions through which
the social world can be progressively transformed. According to Marx's
theory of surplus value, labour is the source and substance of all value
in a society dominated, uniquely, by the production of excess (surplus
value). In capitalist society, surplus value (excess) is produced by the
quantitative expansion of human energy in the process of industrial
production. While the value of labour (human energy) is the value of all
things (commodities), the value which labour produces is not fully
recognised in the financial reward paid to workers (wages). The
difference between the value of the reward and the value that is
produced by workers constitutes the excess or surplus value. In the
world of capitalist work excess equals exploitation. The physical
limitations of human labour, and the continuing resistance of workers to
the imperatives of waged work, mean that human labour is removed by the
representatives of capital from the process of production and replaced
by technology and science. For the labour that remains, work is
intensified physically and enhanced intellectually -- with a clear
distinction between mental and manual workers. As labour is the source
and substance of all value, this joint process of the expulsion and
enhancement of labour is profound. On one side, the expulsion of labour
from the process of production means that the production of surplus
value (excess) breaks down, resulting in dramatic declines in
profitability. On the other side, the release of labour from the
production process provides the opportunity for labour -- and,
therefore, for society as a whole -- to develop its full creative
capacity, in ways that are antithetical to the logic of capitalist
production. Both scenarios, singularly and together, spell crisis and
catastrophe for capitalism (Marx 1993: 706--8). In practice, capital has
sought to restrict the development of discarded labour through the
politics of oppression and the imposition of scarcity, poverty and
violence. Yet the creative capacity of labour remains undiminished, as
seen in May 1968 and by the continuing movement of protest against the
law of surplus value in all its manifestations. These struggles against
capitalist oppression make up the substantive history of modern
political protest (Hardt and Negri 2001). [Higher education is directly
involved in the development of technology, science and the production of
knowledge. The student-academic is both the producer and personification
of this form of knowledge, and, therefore, has a key role to play in
re-engineering the politics of production. Since 1968, and before,
student-academics have played a key role in the worldwide protest
movements against the social relations of capitalist production. These
protests might form the core curriculum for the pedagogy of
excess.]{.underline} The curriculum which informs the pedagogy of excess
cannot get ahead of the protests out of which it has been constituted,
nor seek to ground a new movement of academic struggle in the events of
the past. [The pedagogy of excess requires that the radical history of
1968 is connected to the contemporary situation by recovering the
subversive inspirations around which a more radical form of progressive
pedagogy might be invented. Such a pedagogy would involve inventing a
curriculum that includes grounding the concept of excess in an
alternative political economy, involving a critique not simply of the
politics of consumption but the politics of production. This critical
political economy would provide a theoretical framework within which to
conceptualise the ideology of protest, but no blueprint for
action.]{.underline} Direct action should be informed in this curriculum
by the lessons learned from the history of struggle inside and outside
of the academy. This connection with the history of academic struggle
should include an engagement with other critical pedagogical discourses,
including critical pedagogy and popular education (Freire 2007; McLaren
2000; Amsler and Canaan 2009), as well as ideas that have sought to
connect academic struggles with the worldwide movement of protest:
'public sociology' (Burawoy 2005), 'participative pedagogy' (Lambert
2009), 'mass intellectuality' (Hardt and Negri 2001) and 'academic
activism' (Castree 2000). Working within this curriculum academics and
students can develop networks of alternative research projects. A list
for such projects has already been provided by Dyer-Witheford and
includes: the establishment of new indices of well-being beyond
monetised measures; the new capacities for democratic planning afforded
by new technology; systems of income allocation outside of wage-labour;
the development of peer-to-peer open source communications networks;
research projects that seek to enrich critical political economy with
ecological and feminist knowledges, and the formation of aesthetics and
imaginaries adequate to the scope of what a progressive and sustainable
humanity might become (2004: 90--1[). In this way the pedagogy of excess
becomes a learning process which promotes the creative capacity of
people in accordance with their needs as social individuals]{.underline}
(Kay and Mott 1982). These models of progressive curriculum
restructuring can become frameworks on which to design a progressive
model for higher education. In the recent period French academics and
their students have protested against proposed market- based reforms,
although with a much more pragmatic agenda than in 1968. There is a
growing body of literature that is recording the worldwide
intensification of academic labour as well as struggles to subvert
capitalist work (Nelson and Watt 2004; Bousquet 2008; De Angelis and
Harvie 2009), while at the same time provide alternative models to the
neo-liberal university (Muhr and Verger 2006; Santos 2003; Emery 2009;
Ainley 2005; Berry et al. 2002; Rogoff 2005). Higher education at the
level of society The pedagogy of excess suggests that 1968 offers a much
better model around which to organise resistance to consumerism and
marketisation than Humboldt's liberal vision for the University of
Berlin. [The pedagogy of excess requires that the radical history of
1968 is connected to the contemporary situation by recovering the
subversive inspirations around which new forms of pedagogies were
invented.]{.underline} In 1968 the idea that research was something that
students can do was a revolutionary political statement. [The fact that
by the beginning of the twenty first century these subversive
motivations have been reduced to the technical imperatives of
research-based learning should not conceal the intellectual power that
is generated when academics connect with undergraduate students through
their own research activities, nor the importance for the future of the
academic project that these connections are made, and raised to the
level of society.]{.underline}

#### We should prefer a pedagogy of excess as modeled after the Paris protests in '68, focusing on student-developed curriculum, collaborative acts of intellectual enquiry, and connecting students to radical political history -- this allows students to act as a producer, defying the current consumerist and marketised model of education.

Consumer", Pedagogy of excess: An alternative political economy of
student life \| rpadhi

[The pedagogy of excess is based on the premise that re-engineering the
forms in which teaching and research are configured in universities has
the potential to transform the nature of higher education in ways that
undermine the current consumerist and marketised model.]{.underline} The
mainstream literature on the relationship between teaching and research
at the undergraduate level is limited in scope and ambition, restricted
to an orthodox pedagogic agenda involving the training of students as
researchers or to enhance their enterprise and employability skills
(Healey and Jenkins 2007). Where the writing on this subject extends
beyond these restrictions it is limited to students solving problems to
deal with the complexities of modern life (Brew 2006; Barnett 2000). [In
order to fundamentally challenge the concept of student as consumer, the
links between teaching and research need to be radicalised to include an
alternative political economy of the student experience. This
radicalisation can be achieved by connecting academics and students to
their own radical political history, and by pointing out ways in which
this radical political history can be brought back to life by developing
progressive relationships between academics and students inside and
outside of the curriculum.]{.underline} A review of the mainstream
literature reveals that where writing on this topic does engage with
more radical historical and political issues, for example Elton's
engagement with the writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767--1835), the
political implications of this engagement are not fully developed. The
implications are that the laissez-faire liberalism that underpinned
Humboldt's political project to create the University of Berlin in 1810,
if carried through by contemporary universities, will make the
appearance of the student as consumer more rather than less likely. Is
it possible to create a radical pedagogy based on the links between
teaching and research to counteract the identity of the student as
consumer? [A radical pedagogy can be designed around another version of
student life, based on events in Paris, France in 1968.]{.underline} By
making connections between the university and its own political history,
and by developing a pedagogy that connects teaching and research at the
undergraduate level, it is possible that a radical new pedagogy might
emerge. [It is the possibility of this new radical pedagogy that is
described as a pedagogy of excess. The essential aspects of this
pedagogy of excess are that students can be enabled to transcend the
constraints of consumerism by overcoming the limits of what it is to be
a student in higher education. They can do this through collaborative
acts of intellectual enquiry, working with academics and with each
other, on subjects that look beyond their own self-interest and identity
as students. This academic activity can include exploring the origins of
-- as well as progressive responses to -- the general social crisis out
of which the attempt to reduce students to the identity of consumer is
derived. This pedagogy of excess can only be sustained within the moment
of a real political history]{.underline}. The pedagogy of excess emerges
in a period that has seen strikes by academics and students around the
world against the proposed marketisation of their higher education
system (Klimke and Scharloth 2008). [The pedagogy of excess does not
look for a repeat of 1968, but seeks to develop a critical academic
project that builds on the radical political history of the university,
inside and outside of the curriculum -- in and against the current
version of higher education.]{.underline} Literature review The leading
advocate of connecting research and undergraduate teaching was Boyer
(1990) who conceptualised the relationship between teaching and research
in terms of what he referred to as the scholarship of teaching and
learning. This concept of scholarship has been taken forward by
Griffiths (2004) and Healey and Jenkins (2007), among others, who have
designed scholarly-based pedagogic models organised around the
teaching-research nexus which they refer to as research-based learning.
Connecting teaching and research at the undergraduate level is now
regarded as the essence of student centred-ness (Ramsden 2001), an
important strategy in preparing students for the 'knowledge society'
(Scott 2002) as well as for devel- oping the qualities of professional
expertise among undergraduates (Weiman 2004; Brew 2006). At the same
time, linking teaching and research in the undergraduate curriculum is
seen to have the potential to promote inter-disciplinarity, and to
challenge fundamentally the meaning and nature of research (Brew 2006).
[Where the evidence for the effectiveness of linking teaching and
research stretches beyond the acquisition of academic and professional
skills, research-based learning is seen as a way of providing students
with problem solving and coping skills for a complex world]{.underline}
(Barnett 2000; Brew 2006). Evidence for the effectiveness of connecting
teaching and research at the undergraduate level continues to emerge in
an increasing body of work, e.g. Pascarella and Terenzini (2005), Baxter
Magolda et al. (1998), Healey (2005) and Healey and Jenkins (2007).
However, the potential for further pedagogical advances, grounding
research-based learning in the political history of higher education,
remains undeveloped. This lack of engagement with the political history
of the modern university is surprising given the prominence in the
literature to the work of Wilhelm von Humboldt, the political
philosopher and educationalist. Humboldt is widely credited as having
established the first modern European university in Berlin in 1810 on
the principle of connecting teaching and research. A notable exception
to this lack of political engagement is found in the work of Lewis
Elton. Elton's writings and translations have been important in
promoting the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt in relation to the
historical development of university education in Europe. Elton uses
Humboldt's work as a way of arguing against the increasing interference
in higher education by successive governments. Elton maintains that
government interference is likely to endanger the future of universities
in the UK and in Europe (Elton 2008a). For Elton, as for Humboldt, the
key to limiting state interference and promoting the interests of
universities is the promotion of scholarship, and key to the promotion
of scholarship is the way in which research and teaching can be
connected in higher education. Following Humboldt, Elton argues that
research and teaching are to be joined in a process whereby students
work together with academics in the service of scholarship (Elton
2008b). Elton does not fully develop the political implications of the
points he is making, limiting the discussion of Humboldt's notion of
scholarship to recent advances in managerial science, and to integrating
research-based learning into professional staff development programmes
(Elton 2008a and 2008b). Humboldt's political philosophy An
understanding of the implications of Humboldt's political philosophy
requires an engagement with his book The Limits of State Action (1852).
In this book Humboldt sets out the basis for his commitment to an
extreme laissez-faire philosophy (Humboldt 1993 xlix--lvi). For Humboldt
political philosophy was based on 'the proclamation of complete
self-sovereignty of the individual' or 'extreme individualism' (Knoll
and Seibart 1967: 17--19). The state was to have no positive role in the
area of social welfare, but was a necessary evil whose role is to
protect its members from external threats: every effort by the state to
interfere in the private affairs of the citizens is to be 'absolutely
condemned' (Humboldt 1993: 16). Neither was the state to have any
influence on education, which was to be a private rather than a public
affair: public education was to lie wholly outside the limits within
which the state should exercise its effectiveness (Humboldt 1993: 52).
While working for the Ministry of Education in Prussia Humboldt had to
temper his thoughts on public education, but he did not wholly abandon
his reservations about the state and, with regard to his university
reform, devised a model with considerable autonomy (Knoll and Seibart
1967). Humboldt's impeccable liberal credentials make him no figure on
which to base a critique on the concept of student as consumer. [At the
core of liberal theory lie the fundamental principles of consumerism:
the concept of the individual freedom and pursuit of self interest in a
context which promotes the self organising nature of markets and
denigrates state intervention. Schemes based on liberal social theory
are, therefore more likely to move higher education further in the
direction of marketisation]{.underline} (Zizek 2009). In order to
develop a critical account of the student as consumer it is necessary to
look elsewhere into the historical and political development of the
modern university. 1968: the poverty of student life [A more progressive
basis for the development of a radical pedagogy that engages critically
with the concept of the student as consumer can to be found in the
history and politics of the global student protest movement of 1968 and,
in particular, in Paris, France in May of that year. Although the
student protest in France began in the universities of Nanterre and the
Sorbonne, it quickly spread to include not only students but academics
and workers, across the whole of France. The protest by the students and
workers was not in response to an economic crisis, but was a reaction to
the general crisis in French society as a whole, expressed in a variety
of political, economic and cultural forms. These forms included a lack
of democratic accountability in the universities and the national
political system, an alienating technological and bureaucratic form of
capitalism, and a culture of anti-war protest against French colonialism
in Algeria and American imperialism in Vietnam]{.underline} (Ross 2002;
Gilcher- Holtey 1998; Quattrocchi and Nairn 1998; Seidman 2004; Singer
2002). [Within the French universities this was experienced as an
abundance of ennui and 'the poverty of student life'. The protest
movement culminated in a general strike, which almost destroyed General
De Gaulle's government and very nearly succeeded in creating a new form
of society]{.underline} (Ross 2002; Gilcher-Holtey 1998; Quattrocchi and
Nairn 1998; Seidman 2004; Singer 2002). The revolt was eventually
suppressed but the pro- test has left a controversial legacy about its
nature and significance. This legacy has been the subject of much debate
among sociologists, historians, anthropolo- gists, biographers and
autobiographers around a series of issues that are pertinent to the
pedagogy of excess (Gilcher-Holtey 1998). These issues include the
relationships between the student and the teacher, the relationship
between intellectual and manual labour, the relationship between the
student movement and other social movements and the relationship between
the university and its external environment. At the centre of these
issues lies the question about the representation and production of
knowledge, raising the question about the nature and role of the
university, suggesting that a new form of university is possible based
on the principles of democracy, self-management and social justice[. A
key issue for the protest was the way in which the students engaged with
the critical social theory within which the events were
conceptualised]{.underline}. In France, and throughout Europe, the
protests coincided with the emergence of a radical critique of orthodox
Marxism based on previously unpublished versions of Marx's own work and
other subversive versions of Marx's social theory that had been
suppressed throughout the twentieth century. Key among these critical
theorists was the existential Marxist humanism of Sartre, whose work
reinserted human agency (praxis) against the crude materialism of
structural Marxism (Fox 2003: 19), promoting a 'humanist philosophy of
action, of effort, of combat, of solidarity' against 'the quietism of
despair' (Sartre 1966, cited in Fox 2003: 16). For Sartre human
existence is constituted 'out- wardly by its engagement and actions in
the concrete world' (Fox 2003: 16). [The students were inspired by the
work of Walter Benjamin (1934) who expounded a radical theory of action
and engagement based on the radical cultural movements of Dadaism,
Surrealism and Russian Constructivism. Key to these critical cultural
activities was involving the consumer in the process of production:
where the reader becomes the author and the audience becomes the actor,
not only as the producers of artistic content, but as collaborators of
their own social world, as subjects rather than objects of
history.]{.underline} Henri Lefebvre, a professor in Nanterre during the
protests, argued for the recovery of the concept of 'everyday life' as a
critical and theoretical category, currently constituted by the
'bureaucratic society of controlled consumption' and experienced as
boredom and banality (Lefebvre 1984). [For Lefebvre the revolution must
transform everyday life as well as the social relations of production.
He argued that the irreducibility of human subjectivity is the key to
revolutionary action. The impulse for progressive political activity was
to be found in the human attributes of creativity and desire, expressed
as what he described as 'poesis', i.e. resistance to the alienating
consequences of modern consumerism]{.underline} (Hirsch 1982). In The
Society of the Spectacle (1970), Debord argued that the social world had
been overwhelmed by capitalist relations of production, and that direct
experience and the determination of real events had been reduced to the
passive contemplation of everyday life (Jappe 1999). Debord and his
collaborators in the Situationalist International, of which he was a
founding member, argued in favour of direct action through the creation
of situations which would reveal the absurdity of everyday life. These
spontaneous political protests would be supported by local
worker-student councils which would 'transform the totality of existing
conditions' so that students and workers could 'recognise themselves in
a world of their own design' (Debord 1970: para 179). What all of these
writings have in common is the application of Marxist social theory to a
committed and concrete political action, against the condition of
consumerism and the commodification of everyday life. What is remarkable
about the events of May 1968 is the ways in which this theory was
realised in practice. Action committees: poesis in motion May 1968 was a
moment in which everything happened politically (Ross 2002: 15) -- an
event that was pregnant with a new sense of 'creative political capacity
in France and elsewhere' (Ross 2002: 18). There was a feeling that
'politics is -- everywhere and everything' (Quattrocchi and Nairn 1998:
123), especially in education. [Within the universities self-managing,
democratic, non-hierarchical groups, known as Action Committees, were
established]{.underline} (Posner 1970; Ross 2002; Seale and McConville
1968[). These committees comprised of between ten and fifteen members,
academics and students, initially for dialogue and discussion, promoting
'constant criticism and self discovery' so that 'the movement was able
to constantly radicalize itself']{.underline} (Posner 1970: 47). The
committees went on to occupy campuses across Paris and France. The
Action Committees coordinated demonstrations and demands, and made
contact with the workers and other grassroot protest movements,
dissolving the separation between workers and intellectuals through
expressions of solidarity and the provision of information through
various forms of creative political art, music and drama (agitprop). The
aim of the Action Committees was to abolish the current autocratic, non-
democratic, industry-focused structure of universities with a system
based on democracy and social justice (Ross 2002). But, if the movement
was defined by its theoretically informed organisational forms,
something even more significant was occurring. Ross (2002) points out
that the really transforming aspect of the protest was that the
participants did not perform the roles that had been accorded to them by
sociologists, journalists, historians and politicians, i.e., those who
defined the events of May 1968 as a 'student protest'. The significant
point, argues Ross, is that the students refused to act as students:
'[In the so called "student action" students never acted as students but
as revealers of a general crisis, of bearers of a power of rupture
putting into question the regime, State, society']{.underline} (Blanchot
1998, quoted in Ross 2002 p25). [This refusal to act as students was
compounded by the students' refusal to speak about student issues,
choosing only to speak about 'common affairs']{.underline} (Ross 2002:
118), [raising the protest to the level of society. As Badiou describes
it, the events of 1968 were 'something that arrives in excess, beyond
all calculation . . . that proposes an entirely new system of thought'
and which 'led infinitely farther than their \[the students\] education
. . . would have allowed them to foresee; an event in the sense of real
participation . . . altering the course of their lives']{.underline}
(Badiou 1998, quoted in Ross 2002: 26). Indeed this appears to contrast
sharply with the media representation of students by Williams (Chapter
13) that sees students positioned as largely passive to societal issues.
Key to the notion of revelation was the way in which knowledge about the
events of May 1968 was to be produced, reported and recorded. [Those
involved with the struggle maintained that research should begin from
contestation and revolt. In this way they aimed to break with the
tradition of academic elitism so as to produce knowledge in a populist
and highly accessible style]{.underline} (Ross 2002: 117). [This radical
way of producing knowledge and presenting information was to be a form
of 'direct communication' providing 'a new means of comprehension
between different groups']{.underline} (Ross 2002: 114[) so as 'to give
a voice to those without voices' and to contest 'the domain of the
experts']{.underline} (Ross 2002: 116). In this way those engaged in the
struggle sought to demystify the process of research. For the students
and the workers 'We are in our way researchers, but this is work that
anyone can do' (Ross 2002: 118). [A key means of dissemination of
critical ideas was through graffiti art:]{.underline} Plagiarism is
progress, history demands it Boredom is counterrevolutionary Be
realistic, demand the impossible We work, but we produce nothing. A
pedagogy of excess The events of 1968 have had a profound effect on the
development of higher education in France and around the world. The
post-1968 period saw the emergence of a new form of university:
democratic (Scott 1995), postmodern (Lyotard 1979) and multiverse (Kerr
1963). The key feature of this new type of university was that
universities had now become sites of contested space, not only for the
control and management of the higher education, but in relation to the
meaning and purpose of knowledge itself (Delanty 2001). [A central facet
of the post-1968 period was the development of progressive pedagogies in
higher education based on 'left wing ideas', reflecting the radical
political agenda that had been established by the students in Paris. Key
to these developments was the **engagement of students in the design of
curricula**, including deciding on the content of courses as well as
forms of assessment; and, through the proliferation of independent study
programmes, a recognition that under- graduate students were capable of
creating knowledge of real academic content and value]{.underline}
(Pratt 1997). [In the period since then university administrators and
politicians have struggled to de-politicise the radical substance of
these pedagogical initiatives, while at the same time contain and pacify
students and academics through the imposition of increasingly managerial
and bureaucratic strategies]{.underline} (Zizek 2009). Readings (1996)
maintains that the concept of 'excellence' is the revenge of the
university bureaucrat for 1968. [The events of 1968 provide a powerful
historical and political framework within which to **re-conceptualise
the relationship between teaching and research in higher education in a
way that offers a challenge to the notion of student as consumer and the
politics of marketisation**.]{.underline} The problem is how to recover
the radicality of the 1968 agenda in the current contemporary crisis. [A
progressive way forward is to connect current pedagogies that link
teaching and research with their own radical academic history, and to
develop them in a form that is appropriate for the contemporary
situation. Key to this issue of connectivity is the relationship between
action and progressive political theory. It is the relationship between
theory and action, linked to contemporary struggles within higher
education, that provides a framework for the emergence of a pedagogy of
excess.]{.underline} Action Key to the development of a pedagogy of
excess is that [during the struggles of May 1968 the students exceeded
their role as students -- they became the revealers of a general crisis
in society, and the personification of the ways in which that crisis
might be interrupted and reconsidered, calling into question the
principles and protocols through which the social was organised and
controlled]{.underline}. In the process the students moved beyond the
limits of where they might have expected their experience of university
education to have taken them, exceeding their expectations about the
potentials and possibilities of student life. Through the reengineering
of research and teaching at the undergraduate level, considerable
advances have been made in developing a progressive agenda for students
in ways that take them beyond the mainstream student experience.
[Through the process of real collaboration with academics the role of
student as consumer is challenged, reinventing the student as the
producer of knowledge of real academic content and value]{.underline}
(Neary and Winn 2009). [The strength of this approach is that the
**student becomes the student as producer rather than student as
consumer**, but in the mainstream model the student is still confirmed
as a student.]{.underline} The extent to which these collaborations move
beyond the mainstream teaching and learning agenda depends on the extent
to which the politicised nature of higher education is made explicit,
and [the ways in which the knowledge that is produced is contextualised
politically, as well as theorised critically.]{.underline} Teaching and
learning is made political when it is based on an agenda of contestation
and struggle rather than the managed consensus of university
bureaucracies, calling into question not just particular aspects of
teaching and learning in higher education, but the nature and purpose of
higher education itself. For a pedagogy of excess these contestations
and struggles might include course content, assessment strategies and
student fees, but [a fully developed pedagogy of excess would look
beyond student issues, to matters of more general social concern,
'common affairs', in which the interests of students are not the main
issue.]{.underline} The extent to which these forms of collaboration
extend into projects that attempt to reveal the origins for the general
capitalist crisis is a matter of negotia- tion between the students and
their teachers, but clearly a framework can be established within which
these revelations can occur. [This framework might be extended to become
the organising principle for the institutions of higher education as a
whole]{.underline}. Theory: alternative political economy What was
learnt from 1968 is that practical action is made dynamic when it
connects to social theory. In this context the theory of excess becomes
an antidote to the concept of consumerism and a guide to social action.
The concept of excess as critical political intervention has its roots
in sociology (Bataille), anthropology (Mauss), and Marxist social theory
(Debord). [If con- sumerism is based on the economic theory which
demands that individuals act rationally and in their own
self-interest]{.underline} (Fine and Milonakis 2009), [the category of
excess is offered 'as an alternative to the rationalist calculation of
capitalist exchange']{.underline} (Kosalka 1999). The concept of excess
was most developed in the work of [Bataille]{.underline} (1991), who
[offered the notion of excess as an alternative framework to the
capitalist basis of exchange, replacing what he regarded as a
'restrictive economy', with a 'general economy'. For Bataille this more
general economy would provide a humanistic and non-utilitarian basis for
the organisation of modern society. For Bataille the key to the
organisation of any society was the way in which it dealt with the
surplus that had been produced.]{.underline} Anthropology (Mauss 1922)
had revealed the ways in which non-capitalistic societies distributed
their surplus on the basis of generosity and abundance, as gifts,
promoting a sense of social solidarity through sharing, with an emphasis
on collaboration and consensus. [Acts of extravagant generosity afforded
status and respect to the person who was doing the giving; and, as the
gifts that were being distributed were often intimately connected to the
person who was doing the giving, generating feelings of personal
satisfaction and self worth.]{.underline} These acts of extravagant
giving created a sense of obligation on the part of the recipient,
leading to bonding between individuals and groups. This process of
excessive distribution is contrasted with the consumerist exchange
process of capitalist society which is characterised by dissatisfaction
and alienation. [This promotion of acts of extravagant generosity might
seem somewhat utopian in the context of the modern social world.
However, this process of exchange described by the concept of excess is
instantly recognisable as being at the core of the academic
enterprise]{.underline} (Fuller 2002). The practice of academic excess
has been given further impetus by online computing through, for example,
the free distribution of teaching and learning materials on the World
Wide Web, defined as Open Educational Resources (Iiyoshi and Kumar
2008). [A pedagogy of excess would seek to promote and develop these
activities as a counter to the economistic and market-driven restrictive
practices that increasingly dominate the activity of scientific
enquiry.]{.underline} However, what the politics of student protest has
taught us, during and post 1968, is that [radical consumption is not
enough: the transformation of capitalist social relations lies not
simply in the politics of consumption, but the politics of production,
which, as the revolutionary social theory of the period
demonstrated,]{.underline} can be found in the theory against capitalist
work elaborated by Marx in Capital and the Grundrisse (Debord 1970). The
essence of Marx's revolutionary theory of production lies in his theory
of surplus value (excess) which provides the conditions through which
the social world can be progressively transformed. According to Marx's
theory of surplus value, labour is the source and substance of all value
in a society dominated, uniquely, by the production of excess (surplus
value). In capitalist society, surplus value (excess) is produced by the
quantitative expansion of human energy in the process of industrial
production. While the value of labour (human energy) is the value of all
things (commodities), the value which labour produces is not fully
recognised in the financial reward paid to workers (wages). The
difference between the value of the reward and the value that is
produced by workers constitutes the excess or surplus value. In the
world of capitalist work excess equals exploitation. The physical
limitations of human labour, and the continuing resistance of workers to
the imperatives of waged work, mean that human labour is removed by the
representatives of capital from the process of production and replaced
by technology and science. For the labour that remains, work is
intensified physically and enhanced intellectually -- with a clear
distinction between mental and manual workers. As labour is the source
and substance of all value, this joint process of the expulsion and
enhancement of labour is profound. On one side, the expulsion of labour
from the process of production means that the production of surplus
value (excess) breaks down, resulting in dramatic declines in
profitability. On the other side, the release of labour from the
production process provides the opportunity for labour -- and,
therefore, for society as a whole -- to develop its full creative
capacity, in ways that are antithetical to the logic of capitalist
production. Both scenarios, singularly and together, spell crisis and
catastrophe for capitalism (Marx 1993: 706--8). In practice, capital has
sought to restrict the development of discarded labour through the
politics of oppression and the imposition of scarcity, poverty and
violence. Yet the creative capacity of labour remains undiminished, as
seen in May 1968 and by the continuing movement of protest against the
law of surplus value in all its manifestations. These struggles against
capitalist oppression make up the substantive history of modern
political protest (Hardt and Negri 2001). [Higher education is directly
involved in the development of technology, science and the production of
knowledge. The student-academic is both the producer and personification
of this form of knowledge, and, therefore, has a key role to play in
re-engineering the politics of production. Since 1968, and before,
student-academics have played a key role in the worldwide protest
movements against the social relations of capitalist production. These
protests might form the core curriculum for the pedagogy of
excess.]{.underline} The curriculum which informs the pedagogy of excess
cannot get ahead of the protests out of which it has been constituted,
nor seek to ground a new movement of academic struggle in the events of
the past. [The pedagogy of excess requires that the radical history of
1968 is connected to the contemporary situation by recovering the
subversive inspirations around which a more radical form of progressive
pedagogy might be invented. Such a pedagogy would involve inventing a
curriculum that includes grounding the concept of excess in an
alternative political economy, involving a critique not simply of the
politics of consumption but the politics of production. This critical
political economy would provide a theoretical framework within which to
conceptualise the ideology of protest, but no blueprint for
action.]{.underline} Direct action should be informed in this curriculum
by the lessons learned from the history of struggle inside and outside
of the academy. This connection with the history of academic struggle
should include an engagement with other critical pedagogical discourses,
including critical pedagogy and popular education (Freire 2007; McLaren
2000; Amsler and Canaan 2009), as well as ideas that have sought to
connect academic struggles with the worldwide movement of protest:
'public sociology' (Burawoy 2005), 'participative pedagogy' (Lambert
2009), 'mass intellectuality' (Hardt and Negri 2001) and 'academic
activism' (Castree 2000). Working within this curriculum academics and
students can develop networks of alternative research projects. A list
for such projects has already been provided by Dyer-Witheford and
includes: the establishment of new indices of well-being beyond
monetised measures; the new capacities for democratic planning afforded
by new technology; systems of income allocation outside of wage-labour;
the development of peer-to-peer open source communications networks;
research projects that seek to enrich critical political economy with
ecological and feminist knowledges, and the formation of aesthetics and
imaginaries adequate to the scope of what a progressive and sustainable
humanity might become (2004: 90--1[). In this way the pedagogy of excess
becomes a learning process which promotes the creative capacity of
people in accordance with their needs as social individuals]{.underline}
(Kay and Mott 1982). These models of progressive curriculum
restructuring can become frameworks on which to design a progressive
model for higher education. In the recent period French academics and
their students have protested against proposed market- based reforms,
although with a much more pragmatic agenda than in 1968. There is a
growing body of literature that is recording the worldwide
intensification of academic labour as well as struggles to subvert
capitalist work (Nelson and Watt 2004; Bousquet 2008; De Angelis and
Harvie 2009), while at the same time provide alternative models to the
neo-liberal university (Muhr and Verger 2006; Santos 2003; Emery 2009;
Ainley 2005; Berry et al. 2002; Rogoff 2005). Higher education at the
level of society The pedagogy of excess suggests that 1968 offers a much
better model around which to organise resistance to consumerism and
marketisation than Humboldt's liberal vision for the University of
Berlin. [The pedagogy of excess requires that the radical history of
1968 is connected to the contemporary situation by recovering the
subversive inspirations around which new forms of pedagogies were
invented.]{.underline} In 1968 the idea that research was something that
students can do was a revolutionary political statement. [The fact that
by the beginning of the twenty first century these subversive
motivations have been reduced to the technical imperatives of
research-based learning should not conceal the intellectual power that
is generated when academics connect with undergraduate students through
their own research activities, nor the importance for the future of the
academic project that these connections are made, and raised to the
level of society.]{.underline}

#### To embrace excess and open yourself up to the potentialities of becoming allows for a subjectivity that moves beyond the axiom of the human as the basis for ethics

revaluation]{.underline}.72 [It must see diversity as carrying whole new
ecologies, promising the invention of qualities of experience worthy of
struggle]{.underline}. The theory of value as developed here does not
stop at human neurodiversity. More far-reachingly, [its ecological aim
extends]{.underline} beyond the human brain [to nonhuman modes of
experience.]{.underline} This is not only meant in the sense of
attending to nonhuman entities as part of the ecological complex and its
complexions. [It entails an integral **revaluation of values**, opening

fields of struggle.]{.underline} [This process hinges on adventures of
axiological invention. **It does not content itself with the
self-congratulatory pat on the back of the feeling of being oh-so
tolerant and accommodating, or the smug satisfaction of getting it

**avails itself of excess**: the qualitative surplus value of life of
the more-than-human haloing every predominantly human occasion of
experience with **an infinity of "other" potentials**]{.underline}.73 It
should be evident by now that the "actual ecologies" Guattari refers to
in the opening quotation are not limited to the environmental[. The

reciprocally presupposing systems of complementarity, or virtual mutual
inclusion: [the environmental, the social, and]{.underline} the mental

suggested by the singular vivacity of the quality of the experience of
color, [aims less at these systems per se than at their processual
turnover into each other, and together into new postcapitalist

to reject the metanarrative of rational knowledge]{.underline} (lay
1993). However, [it is]{.underline} also possible to construct
Bataille's suggestions not as anarchistic, but as [an opening up of
knowledge to all possibilities]{.underline}. Transforming student labor
and transgressing utilitarian experience represents the double move out
of alienated school knowledge. A revolutionary [multicultural education
entails teaching students and teachers about the productive basis of
schools and social life. It calls for white teachers to pay attention to
how they manifest their whiteness through their territorial control over
production and expenditure]{.underline}. Revolutionary
[multiculturalism]{.underline} [assists]{.underline} students in
constructing [a concrete education by exposing the contradictions found
in their encounters with the normative spatial orders of
whiteness]{.underline}. **[Revolutionary multiculturalism encourages
young minds to link their critique of school knowledge with the white
exploitation of racialized labor]{.underline}**. However, [revolutionary
multiculturalism also recognizes the importance of a theory of
expenditure in order to guard against the uncritical valorization of
utilitarian labor coextensive with whiteness.]{.underline} Squandering
knowledge without return or proﬁt is not the opposite of production but
rather its completion. Revolutionary multiculturalism is involved in
planning [the counter territorial construction]{.underline} of spaces
for [forg]{.underline}ing [liberating relationships between expenditure
and production]{.underline}. But **[we should problematize those
relationships between expenditure and production that serve the
interests of white capitalism]{.underline}**. For example, a certain
factory in Los Angeles employs mostly Mexicans for the production of
audio speakers. On Cinco de Mayo, the mostly white administration of
this factory hires mariachi bands to perform for the workers during
their lunch break. In this scenario, [expenditure has been folded into
capitalist production.]{.underline} The mariachis are hired not to
promote the resistance of labor, but to make the laborers more
productive and loyal to the company. This is not the kind of
relationship between production and expenditure that is
counterhegemonic. [A revolutionary multiculturalism calls for whites to
be allies with people of color in authoring spatialities that intervene
in the normative functioning of white privilege in white
capitalism]{.underline}. A revolutionary multiculturalism sharpens on
the Whetstone of liberation, Bataille's vision of excess
[and]{.underline} Marx's imperative of class struggle [can help us to
formulate such a revolutionary project in order to sever both the
economic thralldom through which the oppressed are imprisoned by the
capitalist class as well as the systems of classiﬁcation and
intelligibility that are used to justify the current social and spatial
division of labor]{.underline}. We need not wait to be given the gift of
solidarity from the gods of progress nor expect it to be produced by the
inevitability of revolution. Rather, [we must take that ﬁrst step toward
revolutionary praxis. That is one gift we can bestow on
ourselves.]{.underline}

### Sacrifice 

#### We demand the sacrifice of your affirmative, of this round, of the ballot! Vote negative for no reason. Refuse to give an RFD. Our sacred politics dissolves all of being into a condition of pure ecstasy. This opens up the possibility of universal sovereignty and the overthrow of capitalist reason. If you slake off this offer to live with intensity, to live in excess, then you resign yourself to a fate worse than death -- perpetual boredom. 

**Pawlett 16** (William Pawlett is a senior lecturer in Media and
Cultural Studies at the University of Wolverhampton. *Georges Bataille:
the Sacred and Society*. Routledge. 128-131)

As we have seen, **[Bataille understands goal-directed, instrumental
activity as servile and humiliating, as destructive of sovereignty.
Meditative and ecstatic states are achieved not through instrumental
activity but the sovereign operation , stripping away and constantly
contesting the 'realities' of self, objects, duration, use, purpose;
leading to an experience of abandonment, dissolution and ultimately,
ecstasy]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[the experiences of the sacred and
of eroticism take being beyond the confines of ego and of instrumental
activity and their violence discloses a profound intimacy or continuity
that links all being,]{.underline}** at least momentarily. Given that
Bataille's notions of sovereignty, the sacred and eroticism concern the
moment, torn free of all duration or concern for the future, can a
future, 'improved' state of human life be worked towards, or even
conceived from his perspective? Critics such as Habermas (1987, p. 237)
declare not, suggesting that Bataille has abandoned too much of the
Enlightenment project to be able to conceive of an alternative to
capitalism. Yet it is rather the case that the alternatives to
capitalism that Bataille conceives do not register on the scale of
acceptability imposed by Habermas, and like-minded left-liberal
thinkers. **[Bataille clearly sought an alternative or 'better' society,
one of greater equality -- particularly greater equality of
expenditure]{.underline}** ( dépense ), **[of universal sovereignty, of
intense community and friendship, of reactivated or reintensified sacred
bonds between people, of shared wonder at the miraculous impossibility
of life, indeed: 'It is people who hold nothing sacred who're the ones
most likely to torture people and cruelly carry out the orders of a
coercive apparatus']{.underline}** (Bataille, 1992, p. xxv). The
preceding chapters argued that **[Bataille's ideas offer a great deal
for thinking about alternatives to capitalist society]{.underline}**.
**[At a fundamental level, capitalism depends upon the suppression or
curtailing of the sacred, preferring profanation and progressive
weakening of the sacred]{.underline}** (and divine), **[to a dynamic
sacred with the power to disrupt the flows of capitalist
accumulation.]{.underline}** It has often been suggested that capitalism
is steadily undermining its own foundations (Bell, 1976; Harvey, 2014);
yet, it seems that capitalism operates quite comfortably within a system
of fundamental meaninglessness and weightlessness. **[While a moral
order, of some sort, is crucial to the functioning of capitalism, the
sacred as dual and volatile energy is threatening to capitalist regimes
of work, production and accumulation.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[the
sacred in Bataille's sense threatens each of the central planks of
capitalist modernity. Work and production, even reason itself, are, from
this perspective, only grim necessities enabling moments of sovereign or
sacrificial expenditure]{.underline}**. **[The 'elites' of the
neo-liberal system -- corporate oligarchs, speculators and their allies
in government -- do not experience sovereignty or expenditure in
Bataille's senses because they do not give, either of their wealth or of
themselves: they enjoy power and wealth but not sovereignty. Nor do the
'charitable' activities of the super-rich]{.underline}** constitute
giving in Bataille's sense; **[there is no risk, chance or loss
involved, merely an investment in the outward signs of compassion or
humanity. The sacred]{.underline}**, as Bataille conceives it, **[does
not merely provide a sense of rich or 'enchanted' meaning to human lives
where capitalism provides little or none, an observation made recently
by both conservatives and ecologists]{.underline}** (see Stoekl, 2007,
pp. 115--149). It is clear that **[the consumer goods of capitalism do
not satisfy anyone for long]{.underline}**. Nor are **[they designed
to]{.underline}** satisfy, but rather to **[maintain beings in a state
of competitive striving, a degraded potlatch of status, wealth and image
-- and this is the fate reserved by capitalism for the lucky few with
jobs that pay a salary. The sacred]{.underline}**, in Bataille's sense,
**[does not sanctify and preserve the human and its agenda; rather, it
leads to the abyss, to the impossible world of wounded beings in
intimate, ecstatic communication. The sacred is able to do this
precisely because it reinforces limits and prohibitions, yet, at the
same time, insists on their transgression. Limits, boundaries and
prohibitions are absolutely vital to society and also to the inner
experience of communion with others]{.underline}**. Bataille's position
is clear: **[without taboos and their periodic transgression, social
activities are 'emptied of their human character']{.underline}**
(Bataille in Hollier, 1988, p. 114**[). In capitalist modernity limits
and prohibitions are inexorably eliminated. Taboos generally are
considered only as restrictions or controls, as antiquated forms of
repression]{.underline}**. To regard menstrual blood or breastfeeding as
'taboo' today is seen as backward, as evidence of patriarchal
repression. **[But 'liberation' from taboos is always an ambivalent
process]{.underline}**. The weakening of the taboo on menstrual blood
has provided many opportunities for the suppliers of 'sanitary products'
but hasn't delivered sexual equality; regarding breastfeeding as a
simple transfer of nourishment has tended to reduce or make shameful the
notion of breastfeeding as a mutual erotic experience for mother and
child. 1 Taboos on death and on corpses are also being undermined. 2 The
incest taboo, by contrast, has hardened into a moral absolute with any
notion of its transgression seen as 'evil'. Perhaps most ambivalent of
all is the taboo on murder, still -- often hypocritically -- regarded as
an absolute, and yet, as Bataille suggests, indispensable to the pursuit
of warfare in the modern world. **[Yet capitalism, despite its
hypocritical deployment of the transgression of the taboo on murder,
tends to regard not only taboos but all limits as unacceptable, as
barriers to 'free' markets. Spatial limits to capitalism are eliminated
by neo-liberal globalisation; temporal limits to capitalism disappear as
capitalism presents itself as the completion of history; mental and
physical limits to capitalism weaken as employers and advertisers seek
to orchestrate emotions, probing pre-conscious levels of response to
stimuli, exploiting stress levels, demanding that employees create
emotional connections]{.underline}**. So, if **[limits are being
annihilated by the rampant expansion of capitalist markets -- such that
the entire globe is merely a market]{.underline}** -- must we impose new
limits, new regulations? And how could new limits invoke an inner sense
of dread, or at least of obligation? Contrary to some critical works,
Bataille does not suggest that prohibition and transgression have
entirely vanished from modernity, and he fully recognised that
prohibitions that have weakened or fallen away cannot be artificially
reactivated: 'Sacrifice cannot be for us what it was at the beginning of
"time". We make the experience of appeasement impossible' (Bataille,
2011b, p. 45, originally published in 1944). We are then in a new
situation.

Crucial to Bataille's approach is the assumption, or hope, that
**[humanity still feels or experiences servility, avarice and work as
painful and humiliating. Without these aversions it is hard to see how
society has a future beyond its slow annihilation by capitalism.
Contemporary society trumpets what it calls the 'breaking' of taboos,
but this is not the energising transgression of prohibitions but rather
the irreversible elimination of all limits to the operation of
capitalist markets, producing the homogeneous space of
work/consumerism.]{.underline}** In short, **[the abandonment, weakening
or neglect of taboos might not bring maturity, autonomy or liberation --
as Enlightenment discourse proclaims -- but a reduction in the intensity
of human life, a weakening of its collective bonds, a one-way ticket to
a life of relentless banality. The life of 'accepted
boredom']{.underline}** -- as Bataille puts it in the opening epigraph
-- **[triumphs over the intensities of the sacred]{.underline}**. To
address these questions in detail, I turn to Bataille's neglected
exposition on the shifting relations of sacred and profane in modernity.

#### We sacrificed your aff, come and get it

**Bataille 91.** Georges, insane librarian, The Accursed Share: An Essay
on the General Economy vol. 1 consumption, translated Robert Hurley
p.59-61

[The victim is a surplus taken from the mass of useful wealth. And he
can only be withdrawn from it in order to be consumed profitlessly, and
therefore utterly destroyed. Once chosen, he \[the victim\] is the
accursed share, destined for violent consumption. But the curse tears
him away from the order of things; it gives him a recognizable figure,
which now radiates intimacy, anguish, the profundity of living
beings.]{.underline} Nothing is more striking than the attention that is
lavished on him[. Being a thing, he cannot be withdrawn from the real
order, which binds him unless destruction rids him \[it\] of his
\"thinghood,\" eliminating his usefulness once and for all. As soon as
he is consecrated and during the time, between the consecration and
death he enters the closeness of the sacrificers and participates in
their consumptions; He is one of their own and in the festival in which
he will perish he sings, dances and enjoys all the pleasures with them.
There is no more servility in him; he \[the victim\] can even receive
arms and fight. He is lost in the immense confusion of the festival. And
that is precisely \[its\] his undoing]{.underline}. [The victim will be
the only one in fact to leave the real order entirely, for he alone is
carried along to the end by the movement of the festival. The sacrificer
is divine only with reservations. The future is heavily reserved in him;
the future is the weight that he bears as a thing.]{.underline} The
official theologians whose tradition Sahagiin collected were well aware
of this, for they placed the voluntary sacrifice of Nanauatzin above the
others, praised warriors for being consumed by the gods, and gave
divinity the meaning of consumption. [We cannot know to what extent the
victims of Mexico accepted their fate. It may be that in a sense certain
ones of them \"considered it an honor\" to be offered to the gods. But
their immolation was not voluntary.]{.underline} Moreover, it is clear
that, from the time of Sahagun\'s informants, these death orgies were
tolerated because they impressed foreigners. The Mexicans immolated
children that were chosen from among their own. But severe penalties had
to be decreed against those who walked away from their procession when
they went up to the altars. [Sacrifice comprises a mixture of anguish
and frenzy. The frenzy is more powerful than the anguish, but only
providing its effects are diverted to the exterior, onto a foreign
prisoner. It suffices for the sacrificer to give up the wealth that the
victim could have been for him]{.underline}. This understandable lack of
rigor does not, however, change the meaning of the ritual. [The only
valid excess was one that went beyond the bounds, and one whose
consumption appeared worthy of the gods. This was the price men paid to
escape their down fall and remove the weight introduced in them by the
avarice, and cold calculation of the real order.]{.underline}

#### We declare ourselves sovereign, and refuse identification with their cowardly politics. We offer this debate to ecstatic communication, sacrificing certainty to social exuberance. We sacrifice the 1AC, sever its head, flay its corpse, and wear its skin. 

**Razinsky 2009** (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, *SubStance* #119,
Vol. 38, no. 2, 2009 \*\*\*we don't endorse gendered or ableist
language\*\*\*)

Thus we see that the stakes are high. What is at stake is the attempt
 of the subject to grasp itself in totality. This attempt necessitates
bringing  death into the account, but death itself hampers this very
attempt. One  never dies in the first person.  Returning to Bataille,
why does he believe sacrifice to be a solution  to Hegel's fundamental
paradox? For him, it answers the requirements of  the human, for Man
meets death face to face in the sacrifice, he sojourns  with it, and
yet, at the same time, he preserves his life. In sacrifice, says
 Bataille, man destroys the animal within him and establishes his human
 truth as a "being unto death" (he uses Heidegger's term). Sacrifice
provides  a clear manifestation of man's fundamental negativity, in the
form of  death (Bataille, "Hegel" 335-36; 286). [The sacrificer both
destroys and  survives. Moreover, in the sacrifice, death is approached
voluntarily by  Man.  In this way the paradox is overcome, and yet
remains open. We can  approach death and yet remain alive, but, one
might ask, is it really  death that we encountered, or did we merely
fabricate a simulacrum?  Bataille insists elsewhere, however, that
sacrifice is not a simulacrum,  not a mere subterfuge. In the
sacrificial ritual, a real impression of horror  is cast upon the
spectators. Sacrifice burns like a sun, spreading radiation our eyes can
hardly bear, and calls for the negation of individuals as  such ("The
Festival" 313; 215). We did not fool death; we are burned in its  fire.
 Bataille's idea of the sacrifice also addresses Freud's paradox. It
might  be impossible to imagine our own death directly, but it is
possible to  imagine it with the aid of some mediator, to meet death
through an other's  death. Yet on some level this other's death must be
our own as well for it  to be effective, and indeed this is the case,
says Bataille. He stresses the  element of identification: "In the
sacrifice, the sacrificer identifies himself  with the animal that is
struck down dead. And so he dies in seeing himself  die" ("Hegel" 336;
287). "There is no sacrifice," writes Denis Hollier, "unless  the one
performing it identifies, in the end, with the victim" (166). Thus it
 is through identification, through otherness that is partly sameness,
that  a solution is achieved. If it were us, we would die in the act. If
it were a  complete other, it would not, in any way, be our death.  Also
noteworthy is Bataille's stress on the involvement of sight: "and  so he
dies in seeing himself die" ("Hegel" 336; 287), which brings him  close
to Freud's view of the nature of the problem, for Freud insists on the
 visual, recasting the problem as one of spectatorship, imagining,
 perceiving. Bataille's description recapitulates that of Freud, but
renders  it positive. Yes, we remain as a spectator, but it is essential
that we do so.  Without it, we cannot be said to have met death.
Significantly, meeting  death is a need, not uncalled-for. We must meet
death, and we must  remain as spectators. Thus it is through
identification and through visual  participation in the dying that a
solution is achieved, accompanied by  the critical revaluation of
values, which renders the meeting with death  crucial for "humanness."
 Note that both possibilities of meeting death---in the
sacrificial-ritual  we have just explored, and in theatre or art, to
which we now turn---are  social. \[continued\] Thus Freud's text,
although it insists on the irrepresentability of death,  actually
offers, unintentionally perhaps, a possible way out of the  paradox
through turning to the other. Death perhaps cannot be looked at
 directly, but it can be grasped sideways, indirectly, vicariously
through  a mirror, to use Perseus's ancient trick against Medusa. The
introduction  of the other, both similar to and different from oneself,
into the equation  of death helps break out of the Cartesian circle with
both its incontestable  truth and its solipsism and affirmation of
oneself.  The safety that theater provides, of essentially knowing that
we will  remain alive, emerges as a kind of requirement for our ability
to really  identify with the other. In that, it paradoxically enables us
to really get a  taste of death. Bataille radicalizes that possibility.
 Although Freud deems the estrangement of death from psychic life a
 problem, as we have seen and shall see, theater is not a solution for
him.  With Bataille however, theater emerges as a much more compelling
 alternative. Again, it is a matter of a delicate nuance, but a nuance
that  makes all the difference. The idea common to both authors---that
we can  meet death through the other and yet remain alive---is
ambiguous. One  can lay stress on that encounter or on the fact of
remaining alive.]{.underline}  11   Freud SubStance #119, Vol. 38, no.
2, 2009  75  Looking Death in the Eyes: Freud and Bataille  tends to opt
for the second possibility, but his text can also be read as  supporting
the first. The benefit in bringing Freud and Bataille together  is that
it invites us to that second reading.  An Encounter with Death  Death in
Freud is often the death of the other. Both the fear of death  and the
death wish are often focused on the other as their object. But almost
always it is as though through the discussion of the other Freud  were
trying to keep death at bay. But along with Bataille, we can take  this
other more seriously. Imagining our own death might be impossible,  yet
we can still get a glimpse of death when it is an other that dies.  In
one passage in his text, the death of the other seems more explicitly  a
crucial point for Freud as well---one passage where death does not  seem
so distant. Freud comments on the attitude of primeval Man to  death, as
described above---namely that he wishes it in others but ignores  it in
himself. "But there was for him one case in which the two opposite
 attitudes towards death collided," he continues.  It occurred when
primeval man saw someone who belonged to him  die---his wife, his child,
his friend \[...\]. Then, in his pain, he was  forced to learn that one
can die, too, oneself, and his whole being  revolted against the
admission. ("Thoughts" 293)   Freud goes on to explain that the loved
one was at once part of himself,  and a stranger whose death pleased
primeval man.  It is from this point, Freud continues, that philosophy,
psychology  and religion sprang.  12   I have described elsewhere
(Razinsky, "A Struggle")  how Freud's reluctance to admit the importance
of death quickly  undermines this juncture of the existential encounter
with death by  focusing on the emotional ambivalence of primeval man
rather than on  death itself. However, the description is there and is
very telling. Primeval  man witnessed death, and "his whole being
revolted against the  admission." "Man could no longer keep death at a
distance, for he had  tasted it in his pain about the dead" (Freud,
"Thoughts" 294).  Once again, it is through the death of the other that
man comes to  grasp death. Once again, we have that special admixture of
the other  being both an other and oneself that facilitates the
encounter with death.  Something of myself must be in the other in order
for me to see his death  as relevant to myself. Yet his or her
otherness, which means my  reassurance of my survival, is no less
crucial, for if it were not present,  there would be no acknowledgement
of death, one's own death always  being, says Freud, one's blind spot.
 13  Liran Razinsky  SubStance #119, Vol. 38, no. 2, 2009  76  I
mentioned before Heidegger's grappling with a problem similar to
 Bataille's paradox. It is part of Heidegger's claim, which he shares
with  Freud, that one's death is unimaginable. In a famous section
Heidegger  mentions the possibility of coming to grasp death through the
death of  the other but dismisses it, essentially since the other in
that case would  retain its otherness: the other's death is necessarily
the other's and not  mine (47:221-24). Thus we return to the problem we
started with---that  of the necessary subject-object duality in the
process of the representation  of death. Watching the dead object will
no more satisfy me than imagining  myself as an object, for the radical
difference of both from me as a subject  will remain intact. But the
possibility that seems to emerge from the  discussion of Freud and
Bataille is that in-between position of the person  both close and
distant, both self and other, which renders true  apprehension of death
possible, through real identification.  14   As Bataille  says,
regarding the Irish Wake custom where the relatives drink and  dance
before the body of the deceased: "It is the death of an other, but in
 such instances, the death of the other is always the image of one's own
 death" ("Hegel" 341; 291).  Bataille speaks of the dissolution of the
subject-object boundaries in  sacrifice, of the "fusion of beings" in
these moments of intensity ("The  Festival" 307-11; 210-13; La
Littérature 215; 70). Possibly, that is what  happens to primeval man
when the loved one dies and why his "whole  being" is affected. He
himself is no longer sure of his identity. Before, it  was clear---there
is the other, the object, whom one wants dead, and  there is oneself, a
subject. The show and the spectators. Possibly what  man realized before
the cadaver of his loved one was that he himself is  also an object,
taking part in the world of objects, and not only a subject.  When he
understood this, it seems to me, he understood death. For in a  sense a
subject subjectively never dies. Psychologically nothing limits  him,
 15   while an object implies limited existence: limited by other
objects  that interact with it, limited in space, limited in being the
thought-content  of someone else. Moreover, primeval man understood that
he is the same  for other subjects as other subjects are for him---that
is, they can wish  him dead or, which is pretty much the same, be
indifferent to his existence.  The encounter made primeval man step out
of the psychological position  of a center, transparent to itself, and
understand that he is not only a  spirit but also a thing, an object,
not only a spectator; this is what really  shakes him.  16  The Highest
Stake in the Game of Living  Thus far we have mainly discussed our first
two questions: the  limitation in imagining death and the possible
solution through a form SubStance #119, Vol. 38, no. 2, 2009  77
 Looking Death in the Eyes: Freud and Bataille  of praxis, in either a
channeled, ritualized or a spontaneous encounter  with the death of an
other, overcoming the paradox of the impossibility  of representation by
involving oneself through deep identification. We  shall now turn to our
third question, of the value of integrating death  into our thoughts. We
have seen that Bataille's perspective continuously  brings up the issue
of the value of approaching death. The questions of  whether we can
grasp death and, if we can, how, are not merely abstract  or neutral
ones. The encounter with death, that we now see is possible,  seems more
and more to emerge as possessing a positive value, indeed as
 fundamental. What we shall now examine is Freud's attempt to address
 that positive aspect directly, an attempt that betrays, however, a deep
 ambivalence.  As mentioned, Freud's text is very confused, due to true
hesitation  between worldviews (see Razinsky, "A Struggle"). One
manifestation of  this confusion is Freud's position regarding this
cultural-conventional  attitude: on the one hand he condemns it, yet on
the other hand he accepts  it as natural and inevitable. For him, it
results to some extent from death's  exclusion from unconscious thought
("Thoughts" 289, 296-97). [Death  cannot be represented and is therefore
destined to remain foreign to our  life.  17  But then Freud suddenly
recognizes an opposite necessity: not to  reject death but to insert it
into life. Not to distance ourselves from it, but  to familiarize
ourselves with it:  But this attitude \[the cultural-conventional one\]
of ours towards death  has a powerful effect on our lives. Life is
impoverished, it loses in  interest, when the highest stake in the game
of living, life itself, may  not be risked. It becomes as shallow and
empty as, let us say, an  American flirtation, in which it is understood
from the first that nothing  is to happen, as contrasted with a
Continental love-affair in which  both partners must constantly bear its
serious consequences in mind.  Our emotional ties, the unbearable
intensity of our grief, make us  disinclined to court danger for
ourselves and for those who belong  to us. We dare not contemplate a
great many undertakings which are  dangerous but in fact indispensable,
such as attempts at artificial flight,  expeditions to distant countries
or experiments with explosive  substances. We are paralyzed by the
thought of who is to take the  son's place with his mother, the
husband's with his wife, the father's  with his children, if a disaster
should occur. Thus the tendency to  exclude death from our calculations
in life brings in its train many  other renunciations and exclusions.
Yet]{.underline} the motto of the Hanseatic  League ran: 'Navigare
necesse est, vivere non necesse.' ("It is necessary  to sail the seas,
it is not necessary to live.") ("Thoughts" 290-91)  Readers unfamiliar
with Freud's paper are probably shaking their  heads in disbelief. Is it
Freud who utters these words? Indeed, the oddity  of this citation
cannot be over-estimated. It seems not to belong to Freud's  Liran
Razinsky  SubStance #119, Vol. 38, no. 2, 2009  78  thought. One can
hardly find any other places where he speaks of such  an intensification
of life and fascination with death, and praises  uncompromising
risk-taking and the neglect of realistic considerations.  In addition to
being unusual, the passage itself is somewhat unclear.  18  The
examples---not experimenting with explosive substances---seem
 irrelevant and unconvincing. The meaning seems to slide. It is not
quite  clear if the problem is that we do not bring death into our
calculations,  as the beginning seems to imply, or that, rather, we
actually bring it into  our calculations too much, as is suggested at
the end  But what I wish to stress here is that the passage actually
opposes  what Freud says in the preceding passages, where he describes
the  cultural-conventional attitude and speaks of our inability to make
death  part of our thoughts. In both the current passage and later
passages he  advocates including death in life, but insists, elsewhere
in the text, that  embracing death is impossible. In a way, he is
telling us that we cannot  accept the situation where death is
constantly evaded. Here again Bataille  can be useful in rendering
Freud's position more intelligible. He seems to  articulate better than
Freud the delicate balance, concerning the place of  death in psychic
life, between the need to walk on the edge, and the flight  into
normalcy and safety. As I asserted above, where in Freud there are
 contradictory elements, in Bataille there is a dialectic.  Bataille, as
we have seen, presents the following picture: It might be  that, guided
by our instincts, we tend to avoid death. But we also seem to  have a
need to intersperse this flight with occasional peeps into the  domain
of death. When we invest all of our effort in surviving, something  of
the true nature of life evades us. It is only when the finite human
being  goes beyond the limitations "necessary for his preservation,"
that he  "asserts the nature of his being" (La Littérature 214; 68).
 The approaches of both Bataille and Freud are descriptive as well as
 normative. Bataille describes a tendency to distance ourselves from
death  and a tendency to get close to it. But he also describes Man's
need to  approach death from a normative point of view, in order to
establish his  humanity: a life that is only fleeing death has less
value. Freud carefully  describes our tendency to evade death and, in
the paragraph under  discussion, calls for the contrary approach. This
is stressed at the end of  the article, where he encourages us to "give
death the place in reality and  in our thoughts which is its due"
("Thoughts" 299). Paradoxically, it  might be what will make life "more
tolerable for us once again" (299).  But since Freud also insists not
only on a tendency within us to evade  death, but also on the
impossibility of doing otherwise, and on how death simply cannot be the
content of our thought, his sayings in favor  of bringing death close
are confusing and confused.  Freud does not give us a reason for the
need to approach death. [He  says that life loses in interest, but
surely this cannot be the result of  abstaining from carrying out
"experiments with explosive substances."  In addition, his ideas on the
shallowness of a life without death do not  seem to evolve from anything
in his approach. It is along the lines offered  by Bataille's worldview
that I wish to interpret them here.  **Sacrifice, Bataille says, brings
together life in its fullness and the  annihilation of life. We are not
mere spectators in the sacrificial ritual.  **Our participation is much
more involved. Sacrificial ritual creates a  temporary, exceptionally
heightened state of living. "The sacred horror,"  he calls the emotion
experienced in sacrifice: "the richest and most  agonizing experience."
It "opens itself, like a theater curtain, on to a realm  beyond this
world" and every limited meaning is transfigured in it  ("Hegel" 338;
288).  Bataille lays stress on vitality. Death is not humanizing only on
the  philosophical level, as it is for Hegel or Kojève. Bataille gives
it an  emotional twist. The presence of death, which he interprets in a
more  earthly manner, is stimulating, vivifying, intense. Death and
other related  elements (violence) bring life closer to a state where
individuality melts,  the mediation of the intellect between us and the
world lessens, and life  is felt at its fullest. Bataille calls this
state, or aspect of the world,  immanence or intimacy: "immanence
between man and the world,  between the subject and the object" ("The
Festival" 307-311; 210-213).  Moments of intensity are moments of excess
and of fusion of beings (La  Littérature 215; 70). They are a demand of
life itself, even though they  sometimes seem to contradict
it.]{.underline} Death is problematic for us, but it opens  up for us
something in life.  This line of thought seems to accord very well with
the passage in  Freud's text with which we are dealing here, and to
extend it. Life without  death is life lacking in intensity, an
impoverished, shallow and empty  life. Moreover, the repression of death
is generalized and extended: "the  tendency to exclude death from our
calculations in life brings in its train  many other renunciations and
exclusions." Freud simply does not seem  to have the conceptual tools to
discuss these ideas. The intuition is even  stronger in the passage that
follows, where Freud discusses war (note  that the paper is written in
1915): When war breaks out, he says, this  cowardly, conservative,
risk-rejecting attitude is broken at once. War  eliminates this
conventional attitude to death. "Death could no longer be  Liran
Razinsky  SubStance #119, Vol. 38, no. 2, 2009  80  denied. We are
forced to believe in it. People really die. . . . Life has, indeed,
 become interesting again; it has recovered its full content"
("Thoughts"  291). Thus what is needed is more than the mere accounting
of  consequences, taking death into consideration as a future
possibility.  What is needed is exposure to death, a sanguineous
imprinting of death  directly on our minds, through the "accumulation of
deaths" of others.  Life can only become vivid, fresh, and interesting
when death is witnessed  directly.  Both authors speak of a valorization
of death, and in both there is a  certain snobbery around it. While the
masses follow the natural human  tendency to avoid death, like the
American couple or those who are busy  with the thought of "who is to
take our place," the individualists do not  go with the herd, and by
allowing themselves to approach death, achieve  a fuller sense of life,
neither shallow nor empty.  19  [Yet again, Freud's claims hover in the
air, lacking any theoretical  background. Bataille supplies us with such
background. He contests, as  we have seen, the sole focus on survival.
Survival, he tells us, has a price.  It limits our life. As if there
were an inherent tension between preserving  life and living it. Freud
poses the same tension here. Either we are totally  absorbed by the wish
to survive, to keep life intact, and therefore limit  our existence to
the bare minimum, or else we are willing to risk it to  some extent in
order to make it more interesting, more vital and valuable.  Our usual
world, according to Bataille, is characterized by the  duration of
things, by the "future" function, rather than by the present.  Things
are constituted as separate objects in view of future time. This is  one
reason for the threat of death: it ruins value where value is only
 assured through duration. It also exposes the intimate order of life
that is  continuously hidden from us in the order of things where life
runs its  normal course. Man "is afraid of death as soon as he enters
the system of  projects that is the order of things" ("The Festival"
312; 214). Sacrifice is  the opposite of production and accumulation.
Death is not so much a  negation of life, as it is an affirmation of the
intimate order of life, which  is opposed to the normal order of things
and is therefore rejected. "The  power of death signifies that this real
world can only have a neutral  image of life \[...\]. Death reveals life
in its plenitude" (309; 212).  Bataille's "neutral image of life" is the
equivalent of Freud's "shallow  and empty" life. What Freud denounces is
a life trapped within the  cowardly economical system of considerations.
It is precisely the  economy of value and future-oriented calculations
that stand in  opposition to the insertion of death into life. "Who is
to take the son's  place with his mother, the husband's with his wife,
the father's with his  children." Of course there is an emotional side
to the story, but it is this  insistence on replacement that leaves us
on the side of survival and stops  us sometimes from living the present.
"The need for duration," in the  words of Bataille, "conceals life from
us" ("The Festival" 309; 212). For  both authors, when death is left
out, life "as it is" is false and superficial.  Another Look at
Speculation  Both authors, then, maintain that if elements associated
with death  invade our life anyway, we might as well succumb and give
them an  ordered place in our thoughts. The necessity to meet death is
not due to  the fact that we do not have a choice. Rather,
familiarization with death  is necessary if life is to have its full
value, and is part of what makes us  human.]{.underline}  But the
tension between the tendencies---to flee death or to embrace  it---is
not easily resolved, and the evasive tendency always tries to assert
 itself. As seen above, Bataille maintains that in sacrifice, we are
exposed  through death to other dimensions of life. But the exposure, he
adds, is  limited, for next comes another phase, performed post-hoc,
after the event:  the ensuing horror and the intensity are too high to
maintain, and must  be countered. Bataille speaks of the justifications
of the sacrifice given by  cultures, which inscribe it in the general
order of things.

### Surrealism

#### **Bataille and Fanon use surrealism to affirm a notion of sovereignty that empties into infinite freedom -- re-creation and dignity come from a violent upheaval of state**

**Hirsch 2013** (Alexander, Department of Political Science, University
of Alaska. "Sovereignty surreal: Bataille and Fanon beyond the state of
exception." *[Contemporary Political Theory]{.underline}*. 10 September
2013. Accessed 7/14/17. )

**Despite this diametrical opposition, [both Bataille and Fanon share a
common intellectual and political debt to surrealism]{.underline}. For
both thinkers, [surrealism manifests an esthetic of transgression, one
that upends categories of thought deeply embedded in the occidental
imaginary]{.underline}. Surrealism portends [an experimental mode of
sover- eignty, not hemmed in by rational discourses or legalistic
institutionalisms]{.underline}, but rather mapped in [a shifting
assemblage of sensations, forces, practices, relations and
emergences]{.underline}. And at the end of the day it is surrealism's
radical ambition that draws both thinkers: [surrealism]{.underline} that
[seeks]{.underline} not merely to invent a distinct esthetic, but
moreover [to imagine a new self, an uncanny self proportionate to the
convulsive beauty it valorizes]{.underline}.25** **Bataille**'**s
surrealism of '[sheer negativity' takes the self‐possessed and
autonomous subject of liberal humanism as its central
target]{.underline}. A poignant example can be found in Bataille's novel
Blue of Noon. Troppmann, the novel's central protagonist, declares that
he has attained a sovereign condition of 'happiness that defies all
reason'. The experience [is self‐annihilating]{.underline}: 'There was
no more authentic reality in me'. Bataille describes [such
reason-defying self-obliteration as]{.underline} a 'fall into
nothingness \... the fall into the emptiness of the sky \... [the empty
infinite of freedom']{.underline}, which [is linked to death, beauty
and]{.underline} ultimately [to]{.underline} 'that most essential human
possibility: [sovereignty itself']{.underline}.26** **In the 'Fact of
Blackness' chapter of Black Skin, [Fanon strikes a passage that is
almost directly in conversation with Blue of Noon]{.underline}, both [in
its vertiginous surreal imagery and in its depiction of freedom as being
inexorably linked to nothingness]{.underline} (albeit now in reverse
fashion). 'Yesterday', writes Fanon,** **awakening to the world, I saw
the sky turn upon itself utterly and wholly. I wanted to rise, but the
disemboweled silence fell back upon me, its wings paralyzed. Without
responsibility, straddling Nothingness and Infinity, I began to weep.
(p. 140)** **[This is Fanon's rejoinder]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
the dubious counsel of a disabled veteran who has advised that he submit
to his [racial subjection]{.underline}, that he 'adopt the humility of
the cripple', and 'resign himself \... \[to his\] color the way I got
used to my stump'. 'With all my strength', Fanon insists, 'I refuse to
accept that amputation \... I feel myself a soul as immense as the
world, truly a soul as deep as the deepest rivers, my chest has the
power to expand without limit' (p. 140). Where Bataille delights in
Troppmann's self-evisceration, Fanon refuses the empty silence found
there. The dizzying, swirling, beckoning sky to which Fanon turns is
indeed 'convulsively beautiful'. However, it is also the source of a
promise that the enslaved in the colony can never realize. This because
the colonized are cut off from the kind of freedom Bataille describes.
[Forgetting is]{.underline}, as such, [cognate not with sovereignty, but
rather sover- eignty's opposite]{.underline}.** **Of course, despite
these important differences, [both Bataille and Fanon presage a mode of
surreal sovereignty totally opposed to Schmitt]{.underline}. For
Schmitt, sovereignty is a Grenzbegriff, a limit or border concept (see
Strong, 2012, pp. 238--239). Specifically, sovereignty marks the
distinction between ordinary law and he who reigns above that law, and
thus wields the agency to posit its exception. [For Bataille,
sovereignty is defined]{.underline} precisely as the absence of any such
distinction. Moreover, rather than conceive of sovereignty [in juridical
terms]{.underline}, Bataille argues [it is]{.underline} instead [a
condition of existence]{.underline}, one [prompted by the sublime
freedom felt in the midst of decreation]{.underline}.
[Fanon]{.underline} also [describes sovereignty as a condition of
existence.]{.underline} However, the condition of
[existence]{.underline} Fanon [associates with sovereignty is related
now to what we might call recreation]{.underline}. Specifically,
s[overeignty amounts to the dignity earned by those who contest the
colony as state of exception, and project an alternative claim to
decolonized life in the process]{.underline}. Thus, as with Bataille,
one might say that for Fanon [sovereignty refers not to he who declares
the state of exception, but rather to he who violently overthrows such a
state]{.underline}.**

**The alt is a new form of museumificaiton of surrealism that sacrifices
the self to craft a new subject**

**Hegarty, 2k (Paul Hegarty, author and lecturer in aesthetics at
University College Cork, Georges Bataille: Core Cultural Theorist, pg
)/RF**

**[Much is made of Bataille\'s link to surrealism, on the basis of his
personal engagement with the surrealist movement and his
battles]{.underline}** with Breton. Like Bataille, [surrealism seeks to
escape the confines of thought and art of its time, and Bataille has a
strong sympathy with parts of its programme, but it seems to me that he
always regards surrealism as a failure, and that he is writing \'against
surrealism in much the same way as he writes against
architecture.]{.underline} 3 The problem with surrealism is that in
trying to get \'above (sur) it elevates the low (the erotic, the
violent, the deadly) and thereby makes it into a value and the resulting
adulterations matter little to the surrealists: that [the unconscious is
no more than a pitiable treasure-trove]{.underline}; that Sade,
emasculated by his cowardly apologists, takes on the form of a
moralising idealist All claims from below have been scurrilously
disguised as claims from above: and **[the surrealists, having become
the laughingstock of those who have seen close up a sorry and shabby
failure, obstinately hold on to their magnificent Icarian
pose.]{.underline}** (The \"Old Mole\" and the Prefix Sur3, 39; OC II,
103) **[Surrealism, then, becomes little more than therapy - for
society, for the artist.]{.underline}** What is interesting is that
[Bataille does not regard failure as definitive]{.underline} - at least
surrealism has tried. His tone after the war is much more conciliatory
to both Breton and surrealism in general, but all that has altered is
that the general economy leads Bataille to view Icarian failure as one
of the possible \'heights of sovereignty. [The problem that surrealism
never eludes is that of being an aesthetic movement, despite its
conversion to communism and extolling of psychoanalysis (partially
shared by Bataille, at least insofar as he shares surrealism\'s
aims).]{.underline} If surrealism had tried this a bit more
convincingly, it would have met Bataille\'s criteria for how modernism
(Tesprit moderne\') could operate whilst reviving elements from
\'pre-modern societies. He complains that **[instead of blood rituals,
our society has aesthetics]{.underline}** (\'L\'esprit moderne et le jeu
des transpositions \[\'Modernism and the Game of Transpositions\'\], OC
I, 272-3), and, in the main, **[modernism does not breach the
\'separation of spheres\'.]{.underline}** The viewer is able to help
here, even in the confines of the museum. If the work of art is strong
enough, new \'methods of criticism and appreciation can be brought to
bear. **[Bataille rails against the rational consumption of art,
writing, Ί defy any lover of painting to love a picture as much as a
fetishist loves a shoe\']{.underline}** Myth Before the war, [Bataille
sees hope in the form of \'myth\', as myth is what is present in genuine
communities - they embody myth and myth embodies them.]{.underline}
Above all, **[myth inspires the kind of community that exists only in
the festival, in sacrifice. For the individual, \'myth remains at the
disposal of one who cannot be satisfied by art, science or
politics]{.underline}** (Th e Sorcerer\'s Apprentice\', 232; OC I, 535),
and in the exceeding of the individual, myth alone returns, to the one
who is broken by every ordeal, the image of a plenitude extended to the
community where men gather. [Myth alone enters the bodies of those it
binds and it expects from them the same receptiveness. It is the frenzy
of every dance; it takes existence \'to its boiling point\': it
communicates to it the tragic emotion that makes its sacred intimacy
possible,]{.underline} (ibid.) [Myth is given no content by Bataille,
but the implication is that ther e will be myths, in the form of
stories, even if the \'height of existence lies in the moment they fall
away. This falling away is all that separates him from the Fascist
vision of uniting \'the people\' through myth and action.]{.underline}
(\'L\'esprit moderne et le jeu des transpositions\', 273). **[The
fetishist is exceeded by the erotic connection with the object; the art
lover maintains a safe distance.]{.underline}** In more general terms
**[the consumption of art can be more sacrificial, refusing to accept
the boundaries of taste, criteria of skill on the part of the painter,
art knowledge on t he part of the viewer.]{.underline}** In an article
on a painting by Dali, Bataille writes that Dali makes him want \'to
squeal like a pig before his canvases (The Lugubrious Game\', 28; OC I,
215). Along the way Dali and Picasso are seen to \'differ from each
other as much as a cloud of flies from an elephant (30n.; 213n.). The
former was less than taken with Bataille\'s article, and refused to let
him us e a copy of the picture, but Bataille is, in his own way,
praising Dali, emphasizing that he had shown us the low, dirty side of
the unconscious. 4 [If art can still inspire us, \'after the death of
God\', then for Bataille, it has to force out of us a reaction that
exceeds rationality. After the war, myth is presented somewhat
differently.]{.underline} Now Bataille speaks of the \'absence of myth\\
Instead of myth filling, however ironically, the space vacated by God
(perhaps, for the artist, in the form of a \'personal symbolism,),
**[myth now signals its failure - there is no myth left, our last story
is this absence.]{.underline}** Awareness of this is no less a belief
than that granted any other myth and is the further revelation that even
emptiness is only belief, belief only emptiness: \'the absence of myth
is also a myth: the coldest, the purest, the only true myth\* (The
Absence of Myth/, 48; OCXI, 236). [Surrealism is one of the movements
that has never made this leap, content to play around with aesthetics,
believing that somewhere a truth lurked. At another level, surrealism is
part of the absence of myth in the sense that it is a myth without
foundation, and therefore responds to the mythlessness of capitalist
modernist, restricted society.]{.underline} However, it cannot be an
answer, because there is no answer, and although it is not explicit,
maybe the fact of this \'absence of myth being our only myth, and
therefore our only truth, is Bataille\'s equivalent to Adorno\'s
question about the possibility of poetry \'after Auschwitz\'.5 This
\'fundamental lack or emptiness should be taken as underpinning
Bataille\'s longer writings on art that he produced in the 1950s and was
working on up to his death. Much of this work is taken up with questions
of \'the origin of art\', and origins, for Bataille, are only ever
retrospective, even if at first sight his stream of assertions seem to
add up to a belief in a true origin. [Only our lack of myth/truth
enables us to look back, for example, at the cave paintings in the way
Bataille wishes to, as this is the period before myth, or perhaps of
pure myth, without content.]{.underline} The Origins of Art and Humanity
The discovery of the cave paintings at Lascaux, in south-west France, in
1940, informs much of the standard work on the \'history of art\',
wherein a teleology is set up such that all pictures and representations
become part of a pseudo-Hegelian schema where the West is the furthest
along the path to complete Spirit. In a way, Bataille does not offer
anything strikingly different from this. Like many others, and in
particular the artists of the time, he had already emphasized the link
between \'primitive art and modern (ist) art. 6 In Lascaux, **[Bataille
presents and analyses the array of pictures that had been unearthed, and
brings them into his \'system\*.]{.underline}** Here was proof of what
he had been arguing, and here was not just what had been present \'at
the beginning\* but more importantly, what was untainted by the
accretions of truths, and could now be looked at through a modern
\'absence of myth\*. [Lascaux and the later Tears of Eros try to set out
the centrality of art, along with death, eroticism and so on. They are
not always convincing, and Bataille is often drawn into just marvelling
at the violence and raw beauty of the cave paintings.]{.underline}
Whilst this is in some ways an updating of his suggestions about
experiencing art intimately, it is annoying in the long run. Lascaux
brings an addition to the \'system\* of general economy. Previously,
**[death is the \'differential term, both bringing humanity, and being
what lies beyond humanity. Eroticism fills exactly the same position,
and so, as a result of these two, does \'discontinuous being - our
existence as discrete individuals. In addition, awareness of death
brings the possibility or, perhaps, the requirement not to squander but
to accumulate, to preserve .]{.underline}** This in turn breeds the
\'accursed share wher e expenditure become s the outside that was
\'always already outside. [Into this paradoxical beginning of
humanity]{.underline} (always to b e glimpsed in retrospect) [comes
art]{.underline}. In looking at the \'origin of humanity\', we have
looked to evidence of the commemoration of the dead, and also the
existence of tools. **[Bataille adds that the introduction of art and of
play a re also significant]{.underline}** (Lascaux, 27; OC EX, 28),
**[and goes on to say that awareness of death and the world of work and
accumulation (which includes language) is not all that are required to
be human.]{.underline}** Whilst it would hardly be new to say that
humanity exists due to its capacity to create, what might be of more
interest is the fact that, for Bataille, this **[capacity is absolutely
bound up with death, eroticism and the rejection (through utility) of
what is most creative]{.underline}**. He writes that **[\'art, play and
transgression only come about together, in a unique movement of the
negation of the principles which preside over the regularity of
work]{.underline}** (Lascaux, 38; OC Art and Aesthetics 139 IX, 41).
**[This coming together happens under the auspices of transgression and
taboo which, as in Eroticism, constitutes another version of \'the
origin.]{.underline}** As a result, **[all art should aim to
transgress]{.underline}** (Lascaux, 39; OC EX, 42). So what we have here
is more (or less) than a dialectic. Negation, or something like
differance, is at work/play; death as negation forms awareness of life;
this in turn informs work; art, then, is the next negation. Except that
having become this negation, art is transgression of the limits of work.
[Death, too, has become transgression. The taboo, even in the form of
work, is only the going against what was before it, and this is only
informed by what comes after. Once death, art, eroticism or whatever
becomes the outside, the other, it is then also at the beginning:
instead of a progress of negations, there is only an endless crossing
and recrossing of lines. In this, art is perfect, as it is both work and
the excess of work]{.underline} (\'Dossier de Lascaux\', OCEX, 341).
Another paradox awaits us, in the largely straightforward description of
the violent and erotic scenes of the cave paintings. This paradox is to
do with something like \'the birth of figuration\'. According to
Bataille[, the painters of Lascaux show us their humanness in figuring
animality - or at least what we might consider, once \'inside
humanity\', as animal]{.underline} (Lascaux, 115; OC EX, 62). **[This
animality is on its way out, and what we see in the pictures is both
this loss, and that this loss is what defines humanity (mourning might
be too strong a term, however). The human heads are disfigured, or are
replaced by animal heads]{.underline}** (see also Tart primitif, OC I,
251). \'In the sacred moment of figuration, they seem to have turned
away from what should, however, have been the human attitude (Lascaux,
116; OC EX, 63). The reason for this is that the **[\'human attitude is
one of work, and the painting is part of the excess of work, even if a
ritual use value could be attributed to it. Despite his theory not
requiring it, woman, too, is the outside.]{.underline}** Whether Woman
filled this role or not is not the issue - the point is Bataille\'s
attribution of timelessness to it, in a replaying of the worst of
psychoanalysis. **[He writes of the headless sculptures of Woman from
prehistoric times as conveying fear above all else. The multiple breasts
demonstrate, for him, that breasts \'had frightening for a long
time\*]{.underline}** (123; OC IX, 72). I note this comment largely
because it is so representative of his throwaway references to women and
is not essential to his thought at all, but is potentially damaging, due
to its arbitrariness. The Tears of Eros adds little to the points made
in Lascaux. It tries to establish **[the lineage between the erotic,
death-oriented a rt of the caves and Western art insofar as it ha s
pursued transgression, sex, death.]{.underline}** The collection of
images and accompanying text come across as overly thematic, presuming
an untroubled link between excess and its representation, which
contradicts most, if not all, of Bataille\'s theories. Essentially, the
book relies on the presumption that a violent enough scene, conveyed
with some violence, can stimulate the Inne r experience of community
through sacrifice or violence. This book, for its author \[writes
Bataille of The Tears of Eros\], ha s only one meaning: it opens up
consciousness of the self (The Tears of Eros, 142; OCX, 620). Now, maybe
this is only meant to apply to him, in the process of writing, but it is
clearly an attempt to reach at least some of its readers through an
\'absent community\'. Perhaps the most interesting part is the
revelation of the \'Chinese torture pictures that h e had been
mentioning over the years. Th e pictures show scenes, at the beginning
of the century, of a young Chinese man being dismembered, and wearing a
look of ecstasy. Bataille had an ecstatic reaction to the picture, and
this had led him on to think of the merging of religious and erotic
ecstasies through violence (206; 627). Th e book closes with wha t could
be seen as the completion of the story opened in Lascaux: **[Religion in
its entirety was founded upon sacrifice. But only an interminable detour
allows us to reach that instant where the contraries seem visibly
conjoined, where the religious horror disclosed in sacrifice becomes
linked to the abyss of eroticism,]{.underline}** to the last shuddering
tears that eroticism alone can illuminate. (207; 627) Ther e are various
problems here. In his desire to affirm, Bataille has given too much of
an answer - we seem to have finally emerged from the light, blinking
into the dark, and the dark is true. Images seem to serve as means to
another end, and are therefore caught within a restricted economy.
[Further to this point is that Bataille has become overly obsessed with
content, and has neglected to notice that the pictures, however alarming
they might be in their clarity, allow us some control. It would be more
interesting at least to include more firmly the aspect of formal
\'horror\' or \'ecstasy\'.]{.underline} On the more positive side, the
book offers a possible way out of the impasse of having to organize
thought to disorganize it, of having to offer discourse where its
destruction was what was wanted. The Tears of Eros stands as a version
of Bataille\'s system put in play, where the strength of the discourse
cannot help. The images allow a silence to speak, one which Bataille
thinks sufficient enough to provoke a reaction, through contagion. The
book is highly personalized, which some might regard as a good thing,
but even this element is only of worth if taken in the light of his
writings on sovereignty, eroticism and the general economy; otherwise it
is a slightly painful (as in poor) avowal of his own subjectivity.
**[Bataille does not neglect the issue of form in art]{.underline}** (he
is very reticent to think about form in literature). His work on Manet
is a good example of this concern, and a much more successful merging of
his obsessions and theories than the attempt made in Tears of Eros. In
Manet, Bataille makes the now familiar claim that Manet should be seen
as the start of the modern movement, at least within art, both because
of his subject matter, and because of his treatment of it. 7 As usual,
[Bataille focuses on the content of the works he is discussing, but he
breaks through this self-imposed barrier to think about the question of
content, as this is what Manet raises, bringing in contemporary scenes
and characters. Manet goes beyond realism, making art autonomous, writes
Bataille]{.underline} (Manet, 36; OC IX, 126).8 Another of his
favourites, Goya, had opened the way, offering horror to an otherwise
complacent public, and also a meditation on death and the process of
viewing (or writing) - two ways of introducing (or inducing) absence
(51-2; 132). Manet continues in the same vein, but begins to remove the
significance from the content. Unlike purely abstract art, Manet\'s
takes a subject and empties it. The subject is maintained as an absence
that echoes (and even come s before) the death of God. Indifference is
part of this process, and [Bataille cites Manet\'s reworking of Goya\'s
picture of t he assassination of Emperor Maximilian]{.underline} (52-5;
133-4). This [indifference is a revolt against the vacuous persistence
of old forms of art, and he moves toward sovereignty through \'the
silence of art\']{.underline} (58; 135) **[and the silencing of
art.]{.underline}** Olympiads prostitute is all of this, t he bearer of
an aggressive indifference, manifesting a low eroticism, and with Manet
disdainful in the \'underpainted detail, he r \'presence ha s the
simplicity of an absence (67; 142), bringing sovereignty not to what is
figured, but to the process of (de) figuration. Olympia is about the
loss of narrative, a narrative that does get started, only to be lost,
as \'what this picture signifies is not text but \[text\] being wiped
away (67; 142). Above all, Olympia is an attack on all that is solid:
\'Olympia, like modern poetry, is the negation of this world: the
negation of Olympus, of the poem, of the mythological monument, of the
monumen t and of monumenta l conventions (71; 145). This reading stands
as a potentially crucial moment in the Bataillean oeuvre, indicating how
nihilism is there, h ow NOTHING \'is\', when (dis) appearing through a
figured image: in other words, \'pure destruction is of no interest,
compared to the slow burning emptiness that signals the impossibility of
the nothing lurking inside (when it is supposed to be outside, far
away). The subject of the painting - the person being painted, in their
subjectivity - is also subject to attack. Manet\'s way of painting an
individual, his way of emptying the subjectivity and draining the
surroundings, \'is like sacrifice, is sacrifice\', one \'which alters,
which destroys, which kills the victim, without neglecting if (103;
157). As a result, Manet\'s painting is not so much interesting for what
is in it as for what it does (102; 156). Formless To conclude this
survey of Bataille\'s \'aesthetic\', we return to an early piece,
\'Formless (Visions of Excess, 31; \'Informe\', OC I, 217), as this ha s
stimulated one of the essential recent works on modern Art and
Aesthetics 143 and contemporary art: Krauss and Bois\'s Formless: A
User\'s Guide. Rather than repeat what they have done (which is to
formulate a Bataillean aesthetics of modern art, and apply it), I will
draw attention to some points arising from their text, in terms of
Bataille\'s thought in general. Krauss and Bois take \'formless and make
of it a way of theorizing process (amongst other things), arguing on the
basis that, according to Bataille, \'a dictionary begins when it no
longer gives the meaning of words, but their tasks (Bataille,
\'Formless\', 31; OC 1,217), and that \'formless is the beginning of
this new dictionary.9 \'Formless is also what lies outside the
dictionary, that which is covered up in the assigning of forms, and it
therefore operates as the differance between Form and Formlessness.
Krauss and Bois do not take the next step, which is to note that
\'formless too is a form, a way of encapsulating \'that which escapes
form\', so is trapped within the world of form, rather than being a
resistance to it, or its inherent unravelling. Insofar as it is an
unravelling, it is that which is within the giving of forms, and cannot
be. we look at the last sentence of \'Formless\', we can see that
Bataille signals formless as the arbitrariness, the impossibility, the
nonevent of form that form hides (like presence to absence, life to
death and so on): \'affirming that the universe resembles nothing and is
only formless amounts to saying that the universe is something like a
spider or a gob of spit (31; 217 trans, mod.). **[As with chaos
mathematics, it is a mistake to think that \'formless is the site or
process of the loss of forms - rather it is a new way of looking at how
form coalesces - a way that entails thinking the continual movement
between something and nothing, form and lack of form.]{.underline}** In
short, [all form \'contains\'formlessness, and the formless cannot be
brought out.]{.underline} In terms of Bataille\'s oeuvre, the \'formless
occupies a space similar to that held by abjection. [It is both an
\'outside and something permeating the \'inside (of form, of identity,
of solidity). In terms of aesthetic philosophy, we could liken it to
Kant\'s sublime: totally outside of the categories of beauty, but
somehow informing them, as that which beauty cannot simply be. But
Bataille\'s \'sublime is one of the movement of crossing, of
transgression rather than an observation of something fearful
\'outside\'. From the early writings on, Bataille is effectively looking
for some kind of sublime where the process of representation is
exceeded.]{.underline} In this excess, **[the individual loses their
isolated subjectivity and joins with the loss \'presented by a work of
art.]{.underline}** Even if Bataille never really moves far from such an
idea, **[excess is written in a way that is the opposite of the sublime
as some kind of regulating device, some way of letting off ontological
steam. Throughout his writings, loss, waste, death, sacrifice and so on
are determining, in the end, and not adjuncts. His writings on art
contain both the best and the worst elements of his obsessions: on the
one hand we get dynamic dispersal of form, content, subjectivity; on the
other, a simplistic liking for a pseudo-gothic aesthetic.]{.underline}**

#### **Excessive spaces generate a reconception of sovereignty where democracy is no longer defined by bitter experience -- surrealism ensures that sovereignty eludes the grasps of the decisionist politics and neoliberalism that are deployed to exclude -- surreal sovereignty regenerates a subject conception for excluded peoples**

**Hirsch 2013** (Alexander, Department of Political Science, University
of Alaska. "Sovereignty surreal: Bataille and Fanon beyond the state of
exception." *Contemporary Political Theory*. 10 September 2013. Accessed
7/14/17.)

Today, sovereignty appears to be on the move. Aihwa Ong has suggested
that [global capital has patterned the world into reconditioned zones of
production, distribution and consumption entailing 'adjustments and
compromises in national sovereignty']{.underline}. The result has been
[a recalibration of 'graduated sovereignty']{.underline}, which for Ong
(2006) [refers to 'the effects of a flexible management of sovereignty,
as governments adjust political space to the dictates of global capital,
giving corporations an indirect power over the political conditions of
citizens in zones that are differently articulated to global production
and financial circuits']{.underline} (p. 78). In reading contemporary
mutations of sovereign life in this fashion, Ong argues for a more
expansive view of Schmittian exceptionalism: 'I conceptualize the
exception more broadly, as [an extraordinary departure in
policy]{.underline} that [can be deployed to include as well as to
exclude']{.underline}. By this, Ong means that though contemporary
critics often turn to Schmitt in order to theorize Guantánamo Bay and
all the exclusions upon which that particular sovereign exception
depends, for instance, [the market-driven logic of the exception qua
global capital can also be a 'positive decision to include selected
populations and spaces as targets of calculative choices and
value‐orientation associated with neoliberal reform]{.underline}'. Of
course, in a world beset by economic flux, brought on by the global
financial crisis of 2008, one wonders just how totalizing the neoliberal
technologies of disciplinary power Ong describes truly are.
[Sovereignty]{.underline}, in the current conjuncture, [appears to be
less obviously a technology of neoliberal governmentality]{.underline}.
The temper has changed, [generative openings are surfacing and
re-surfacing. New forms of sovereign life]{.underline}, rich and thick
with political possibility, [have been proliferating]{.underline} in
West Asia and Northern Africa, where the Arab Spring is working [to
sweep away old decisionist regimes]{.underline}; in the Iberian and
Hellenic worlds, where upheaval is a recurrent potentiality; and [in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [where the **Occupy** movement
managed to galvanize popular unrest and dissatisfaction with neoliberal
policies, if only for a moment]{.underline}. I would argue that [these
are events of]{.underline} what Sheldon Wolin calls [fugitive
democracy]{.underline}. By democracy Wolin (1996) does not mean
something akin to liberal procedural justice; rather, '[democracy needs
to be reconceived as something other than a form of government: as a
mode of being conditioned by bitter experience, doomed to succeed only
temporarily, but is a recurrent possibility so long as the memory of the
political survives']{.underline} (p. 22). Democracy for Wolin, in other
words, is not about legal institutionalism, public administration or
decisionist forms of exceptional power imposed from on high. Rather,
[democracy appears in flash scenes of constituent power that percolate
up from below]{.underline}. Such moments call for a theory of
sovereignty tantamount to the 'mode of being conditioned by bitter
experience' they epitomize.27 Bataille and Fanon provide a felicitous
point of departure for [reconceptualizing sovereignty]{.underline} in
precisely these terms. Sovereignty, for both thinkers, [is a species of
being]{.underline}. Specifically, [sovereignty is a condition shot
through with surreal experiences that render strange the familiar
categories of thought, replacing them with new structures of
feeling.]{.underline} For Bataille, these experiences are decreative,
while for Fanon they are recreative. For Bataille, [sovereignty
ecstatically dislocates the subject]{.underline}, whereas for Fanon
[sovereignty regenerates a remembered subjectivity to those from whom it
has been taken.]{.underline} To indicate that Bataille and Fanon speak
to our political present is not to sound sanguine about the prospects
for wholesale transformation. [The question for the new sovereignty
projects emergent on the world stage is how **to sustain, in the post-
insurrection phase, contestations over the meaning and modalities of
social change**]{.underline}. This is a question that scholars and
activists will continue to ponder and debate. What does appear clear,
however, is that there is something that exceeds the regulatory function
of neoliberal sovereignty's spaces and targets of 'calculative choices
and value‐orientations'. [Bataille and Fanon are stewards of these
**excessive spaces**. And in their **surreal visions of sovereignty,
something is born out that eludes the grasp of decisionist politics,**
something worth dignifying]{.underline}.

#### Social insitutions seek to regulate profanation through the The Scared. Economics, politics, and religion revolve around The Sacred's orientation towards profanation, mediating all interactions and relations of human societies.

Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

\... the sociology we intended to expound here was not the generally
accepted sociology, nor was it a religious sociology, but rather, very
precisely, sacred sociology. (Bataille, 1970, Vol. 2, trans. in Hollier,
1988: 104) [We are accustomed to the belief that societies possess
form]{.underline}: simple or complex, agrarian or industrial,
traditional or modern; [that societies are made up of
structures:]{.underline} classes, institutions, nations, discourses,
networks[; and that these structures are saturated with politics or
power **relations. The political dimension of a society is often viewed
as quasi-autonomous,**]{.underline} **[a determining or causal force
having primacy over other spheres of society such as religion, cultural
expression, economic relations]{.underline}** **[and everyday life which
are often said to 'reflect' power relations]{.underline}**. **[Neither
Bataille nor Baudrillard subscribe to this three-fold
belief]{.underline}**, although they certainly differ in their modes of
refusing this image of society. For Bataille, the political can never be
separated from the economic and religious spheres of life, but he does
not thereby give primacy to the religious dimension. Rather, the notion
that society or human life consists of conceptually separable but
interlocking domains, each bearing the imprint of power, is rejected.
**[Power is, for both Bataille and Baudrillard, a derivative and
residual category, resulting, ultimately, from
profanation.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard, the possession of power is
remarkably evanescent and fragile, prone to sudden reversals and
disappearance (Baudrillard, 2009). [For Bataille,
**society,**]{.underline} defined schematically[, **is the result of the
barriers erected against the sacred and its forces of
repulsion**]{.underline}. [The notion that societies,]{.underline}
either in their contractual associations, or in their more affective and
communal dimensions[, are based on inter-attraction and mutually
beneficial interaction is]{.underline} entirely [rejected by Bataille**.
Society, through its institutions or practices of economy, religion and
politics, concerns the channelling of some aspects of the sacred towards
relatively durable relationships with the profane world, the world of
things, while other aspects remain excluded or prohibited**. **The
sacred domain, as a whole, is heterogeneous to all social structures and
institutions, including religion.** **Economics, politics and religion
concern the knowing, ordering and manipulation of profane things, for
the purpose of accumulation**]{.underline}. 178 Theory, Culture &
Society 35(4--5) This is the realm of homogeneity, of profane [things
abstracted from 'totality' or 'intimacy' and subjected to discursive
knowledge, identity and duration.]{.underline} **[Yet these social
institutions must enter into a durable relationship with the 'pure'
aspects of the sacred to confer on them the stability, meaning and an
ultimate purpose which they lack and cannot generate from within
themselves (]{.underline}**Bataille, 1985: 137--60). Bataille's
lectures, 'Attraction and Repulsion 1 and 2', delivered to the College
of Sociology early in 1938, present his alternative approach to
theorizing the relationship between the sacred and society. **[The
defining feature of human societies]{.underline}**, Bataille insists,
[**is that all relations and interactions are mediated, to a greater or
lesser extent, by the sacred**. The 'sacred nucleus' of society is not
merely subject to, or protected by, a system of cultural prohibitions --
a position that might be derived from Durkheim's Elementary
Forms]{.underline} (1995\[1912\]); [for Bataille]{.underline}
(1988\[1949\]: 104) [the sacred nucleus is repulsive]{.underline}, it is
a special kind of 'filth', 'untouchable and unspeakable'. [**Further,
the sacred core is not unconscious in the Freudian sense since it
precedes or exceeds any distinction between conscious and unconscious**.
The sacred is]{.underline} not disavowed \[Verleugnung\] or foreclosed
\[Verwerfung\] from consciousness, rather [the experience of the sacred
creates another, altered and 'richer' consciousness than that adapted to
and confined by the homogeneous domain]{.underline} (Bataille,
1991\[1949\]: 93). **[The sacred then is immediately collective, a
contagion linking individuals by a potent sense of shared, interior and
constitutive repulsion, taking them beyond their homogeneous
existence.]{.underline}** For Bataille, the sacred concerns
communication in the profoundest sense, where being itself is placed at
stake. **[Although social being is forged in repulsion, the sacred, as a
whole, functions to transform the sentiments of horror and repulsion
into joy, strength and attraction]{.underline}**: Now, human nature as a
whole, in each group agglomerated around each sacred nucleus, has, to a
large extent, by participating in the activity of this nucleus, acquired
the faculty of transforming the left into the right, distress into
strength. (Bataille, 1970, Vol. 2: 317, in Hollier, 1988: 111) There is
a remarkable duality and 'renversement' in play here: [**the sacred
nucleus is repulsive**, gathering repulsion to itself -- as a graveyard
gathers the dead, for example --]{.underline} **[yet it amplifies
repulsion,]{.underline}** [confronting the group with
horror,]{.underline} **[only to dramatically transform this repulsion
into social attraction]{.underline}**. The notions of spontaneous
inter-attraction, similarity, cohesion, survival -- all the phantoms of
liberal ideology -- are, or would be if they existed, insufficient to
form a society or 'agglomeration'. [Only the dynamic alternation of
repulsion and attraction can channel sacred and profane into a form
which sustains social life.]{.underline} The left pole of the sacred
Pawlett 179 is dual in that it is heterogeneous to the profane, and also
heterogeneous within itself, a formless matter that cannot be ascribed
identity and which operates through ambivalence, switching, reversal and
which is, nevertheless, the foci for all spiritual or religious
endeavour. The category of the profane is also far from unitary.
Bataille follows Durkheim in understanding the profane as providing a
firm foundation from which the leap into the sacred can be achieved;
however in modernity, with the reciprocal weakening of sacred and
profane in favour of an indifferent 'reality', the profane, if it is
considered meaningful at all, contains a sense of impurity and
defilement conferring the power of profanation. Unfortunately, neither
Durkheim nor Bataille examine the category of the profane in great
detail, indeed Pickering (1984: 136--9) regards this as a fundamental
weakness in Durkheim's sociology. It has been argued that Bataille's
pairing of sacred and profane, and of taboo and transgression, is
fundamentally dialectical and Hegelian (see, for example, Habermas,
1987), but the left sacred is immediately both 'taboo' and
transgressive, a seething disorder which is also the only possible
source of any order

#### The sacrificial ritual transforms horror into joy by reminding participants of their finitude. 

**Pawlett 18**

(Dr. William Pawlett, Wolverhampton School of Art, "The Sacred,
Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

[The moment of sacriﬁcial immolation is,]{.underline} for Bataille[, a
moment of 'totality', of the immanence of all things]{.underline}.
Indeed, **[sacriﬁcial ritual, as the putting to death of limited or
self-contained thingness]{.underline}** [(of plants, cakes, animals, and
even, apparently, humans),]{.underline} **[is remarkable when seen
through the topology of the sacred.]{.underline}** Where the sacred as a
general category converts left-pole sentiments of horror, despair and
loss into rightpole sentiments of joy and unity, **[sacriﬁcial ritual
stages violent death, evoking the horrors of the left pole deliberately
to supercharge the transformation of horror into euphoria and
joy]{.underline}**. Bataille elaborates that [**this joy is always
ambivalent as it is achieved only through the participants' awareness
that their 'thingness' too will, in time, be destroyed**. Nevertheless,
sacriﬁce reveals]{.underline} that [**life is not limited by work,
duration or 'reality', that it is limited only by death**.5 The
'absolute dismemberment' of sacriﬁcial ritual, extending from the victim
to the witnesses, is inassimilable to Hegel's dialectics of recognition.
Only in confrontation with the 'sacred left' is the totality of being at
stake; sacriﬁcial ritual is then a site for both the experience and
expenditure of the 'radical negativity' of human being]{.underline}
(Bataille, 1937, in Hollier, 1988: 89--93). What has become of this
special kind of ﬁlth that forms the nucleus of any community? Bataille
occasionally used the crude and unsatisfying term 'post-sacred' to
describe European modernity, but a far more subtle position is also in
evidence in his more sociological [writings. Can the sacred core still
eﬀect a transmission of left-pole sentiments and experiences to the
right pole? Unquestionably it can]{.underline}. But, nevertheless,
**[the left pole of the sacred is transformed by
modernity.]{.underline}** Bataille follows Weber in asserting that
capitalism was not brought about by the actions of merchants or
entrepreneurs, but by 'a new spirit' or 'ethos' provided by Protestant
Reformism (Weber, 1992\[1905\]: 31).

#### Protestantism reveals the notion of the Sacred/Profane in which the mere existence of profanity is what renders it impure, forming the larger categroy of evil. 

**Pawlett 18**

(Dr. William Pawlett, Wolverhampton School of Art, "The Sacred,
Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

[**The Protestant notion of a 'calling' concerns an individual's duties
to the profane realm, while the speciﬁcally Calvinist notion of
predestination increases the scope of sin, ﬁxing and interiorizing it
within individual conscience**. Bataille adds a further
layer]{.underline} to this thesis, only hinted at by Weber:
**[Protestantism situates evil and the powers of Satan within the
profane realm where they may roam free, while God is ﬁgured as remote
and as entirely transcendental]{.underline}** (Bataille, 1989\[1973\]:
79--85[**). The vast majority of people have no access to God, nor to
the sacred**, not through their imagination or passions, not through the
mediation of the priesthood or sacraments, not through their
salvation.]{.underline} **[All that remains is 'an absolute duty to
consider oneself chosen' and to work diligently to demonstrate not one's
salvation but merely that one is dealing positively with the fear of
damnation]{.underline}** (Weber, 1992\[1905\]: 66). 'Keep calm and carry
on', the irritating slogan of life under the perpetual austerity of
neo-liberal capitalism is, it seems, much in accord with the life-long
misery created for believers by Calvinism in the 17th century.
**[Capitalism, in summary, is built upon a profound profanation, not
merely a profanation of speciﬁcally sacred things -- although this does
occur, and is a frequent tactic of colonial violence -- but a
deep-rooted irreversible profanation of the once dual and reversible
movements of sacred and profane.]{.underline}** Bataille elaborates
further, yet remaining in a schematic mode, in Erotism (1986\[1957\]).
**[Christianity]{.underline}**, he argues, **[reduces religion to its
'benign aspect', expelling the left sacred and projecting it into the
profane world.]{.underline}** **[The mechanism of transgression is
fundamentally re-ordered so that it no longer oﬀers a pathway into the
sacred realm; indeed Satan, the angel of transgression, falls to earth
as 'transgression was the basis not of his divinity but of his
fall']{.underline}** (pp. 120--1[). Indeed Christian culture generates a
new religious categorization:]{.underline} **[the simultaneously profane
and impure or diabolic, with no eﬀective limits or demarcations between
the two]{.underline}**. For Bataille '**[only in Christianity did the
existence of the impure world become a profanation in itself. The
profanation resided in the fact that it existed, even if pure things
were not themselves sullied']{.underline}** (p. 122). [Thus, while
spitting on a religious symbol or text may be regarded as a profanation,
in Christian and especially in Puritan culture, spitting on the pavement
is considered impure and deﬁling, animalistic or base]{.underline}.
**[The animal, base or low, is fully segregated from the sacred,
producing a category]{.underline}** Bataille sometimes [**refers to as
'**divine' rather than sacred]{.underline}. Further, **[the merging or
indiﬀerentiation of the impure and the profane generates an enlarged
category of evil]{.underline}** as, for Bataille, a
'[misunderstanding']{.underline} of the [volatile movements of
sacredness between left and right poles]{.underline}. **[Modernity is
left in thrall to the seduction and fascination exerted by evil and the
perverse ﬁgures of its embodiment]{.underline}**. Good and Evil,
partnered by Spirit/Mind and Matter, are reductive modern dualisms,
issuing from the profanation of the left pole of the sacred. **[Good and
evil are two aspects of this world: there is no other heterogeneous
world, just one world, or 'reality'. Profanation creates a reality at
the mercy of evil, or of a violence 'set free on all
sides']{.underline}** (Bataille, 1989\[1973\]: 85). [Sovereignty is
reduced to the mastery of the world of things, including people reduced
to the status of things.]{.underline} The heterogeneous is now
everywhere and nowhere, placeless and unconﬁned; it is the heterogeneous
in this sense that characterizes much of Baudrillard's later thought.
According to Baudrillard, evil is now eliminated from the profane world
too; it has no place in the world of transparency.

#### Modernity is defined by a state of immune-deficiency which seeks to neutralize all threats and repulsions. 

**Pawlett 18**

(Dr. William Pawlett, Wolverhampton School of Art, "The Sacred,
Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

[**Baudrillard posits a fundamental shift to (self-deﬁned) 'modern'
cultures characterized by an irresistible proliferation of indiﬀerence
and transparency brought about by a generalized loss of speciﬁcities and
limits. Systems, physical, mental and technological, crash through their
former limits into the condition of simulation and uncertainty where
values are not realized or transcended but are circumvented or bypassed
through a higher logic of homogenization and control. Simulation is**
not merely the condition of abstraction or mediation but **a logic of
control which operates by plunging all judgement of value and direction
into irresolvable uncertainty.**]{.underline} [The system of simulation
and transparency constitutes a further attack on impurity, a further
reduction of the single world of profane 'reality']{.underline}.
**[Evil, disorder, death and all other impurities, all living
contradictions to the principles of functionality and performance, are
treated with attempted neutralization]{.underline}**. **[Natural and
social bodies are]{.underline}**, for Baudrillard, now
**['over-protected', over-managed]{.underline}** in their being wrested
from their former limits, values and trajectories. **[Modernity tends
towards a state of immune-deﬁciency, characterized by allergic
over-reactions to minimal or non-existent threats]{.underline}** on both
collective and individual levels, to sudden glitches and reversals in
hyper-eﬃcient systems: a major example being the viral attack, which
crosses all boundaries of the natural, social and technological. Never
shy of pushing an argument to extremes, Baudrillard contends that **[the
principle of reversibility, once the very form of symbolic exchange
rituals, is now manifest through the reintroduction of evil into social
systems that had attempted to banish all impurities]{.underline}**.
**[Evil returns,]{.underline}** not as moral category or content, but as
the reversal of dominant systems, **[as the involuntary and
unanticipated secreting of new limits in apparently limitless
systems]{.underline}**: 'Abreaction, rejection and allergy are
manifestations of a singular kind of energy, a visceral energy which has
replaced negativity and critical revolt' (Baudrillard, 1993b: 71).
Disgust and repulsion, including self-loathing, as well as disgust with
the state, society, political reason and authority, become deﬁning
features of the contemporary world, Baudrillard insists. **[Repulsion
and radical negativity remain the deﬁning characteristics of social
being, but are now unhinged from reciprocal movements with attraction,
without the strengthening and restorative eﬀects of dynamic alternation
between left and right poles]{.underline}**. **[In an age that has
sought to remove prohibitions and limits, to trumpet a banal,
consumerist liberation which has precious little connection to the
desire for freedom, new limits and barriers are forming]{.underline}**.
There is even, Baudrillard claims, a prevailing 'disgust with the lack
of disgust', a redoubling and proliferation of disgust no longer
hindered by any value that could be set into opposition (symbolic or
dialectical) to disgust (p. 73). Lacking a dramatic or symbolic sense of
the Other (Baudrillard prefers to capitalize), long since reduced and
sanitized into 'diﬀerence', **[we turn on ourselves in a limitless
process of self-experimentation which is driven by
self-disgust.]{.underline}**

#### **[Society is defined by its excesses -- 'The Social' serves to prevent the accumulation of surpluses and ensure the productivity of individual lives. This results in a hegemonic culture of happiness in which evil is misfortune which can be controlled and eliminated through risk assessment.]{.underline}** 

**Pawlett 18**

(Dr. William Pawlett, Wolverhampton School of Art, "The Sacred,
Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

Where does this leave society, or 'the social'? Baudrillard remained
insistent that any **[society is most clearly deﬁned by its excesses,
its vices, its immorality, its negatives]{.underline}** -- an argument
he draws from Bernard Mandeville's notorious The Fable of the Bees
(1997\[1723\]), in addition to the inﬂuence of Bataille, and others,
such as Pierre Klossowski. '[**The social'** as it is generally
presented today, by the social sciences, **is**]{.underline}, [for
Baudrillard]{.underline}, **[an abstraction produced or simulated from
'the ruins of the symbolic and ceremonial ediﬁce]{.underline}**'
(Baudrillard, 1983: 65). Indeed, '**[the social', in a fundamental
symbolic or sacred sense, begins to disappear at the same time that it
is produced or simulated by leading social institutions: the economy,
polity, health, etc]{.underline}**. In a sense then, **[societies
dominated by symbolic exchange or by the duality of the sacred were
'societies without a social']{.underline}** (p. 76, emphasis in the
original). Indeed, for Baudrillard[, **'the social' emerges and
proliferates, ultimately, to replace the mechanism of sacriﬁce; sacriﬁce
(as a form of symbolic exchange) had prevented the accumulation of
'remainders', of surpluses of wealth, power through which the state and
market establish themselves.**]{.underline} In modernity '**[the social
exists to take care of the useless consumption of remainders so that
individuals can be assigned to the useful management of their
lives']{.underline}** (pp. 77--8, emphasis in the original).
Nevertheless, death, the repulsion of death and the spectacle of death,
remain, for Baudrillard, powerfully collective (Baudrillard
1993a\[1976\]: 160--3, 2003\[2002\]: 3--34). [Baudrillard's writings on
the 9/11 attacks draw together the themes of sacriﬁcial death,
collective spectacle and internal rejection in the contemporary age of
global media and global security with the startling assertion: 'they did
it, but we wished]{.underline} for it' (Baudrillard, 2003\[2002\]: 5,
emphasis in the original[). The suicidal--sacriﬁcial acts of 9/11,
countering terror with terror, unleashed the 'absolute weapon of death':
the horror and misery of the left pole of the sacred]{.underline} (p.
8). [Yet, within a culture of irreversible profanation, having
neutralized the collective, ritual movements between left and right
poles of the sacred, the only available responses to 9/11 were
mediatized rituals of condemnation and mourning and the military
reprisals which]{.underline}, for Baudrillard, [both fell far short of
the symbolic level at which we are all 'complicit' in the
attack.]{.underline} **[Such complicity is a dual or symbolic form, a
disavowed and heterogeneous 'pact' against the (illusory) global world
order]{.underline}**. In his very late works The Intelligence of Evil
(2005), The Agony of Power (2009) and Carnival and Cannibal (2010),
Baudrillard examines what he understands as the **[disappearance of both
evil as symbolic/ poetic and evil as metaphysical form from the culture
of global technomodernity, which enforces a 'hegemonic culture of
happiness]{.underline}**' (Baudrillard, 2005a: 139). Broadly speaking,
**[good is reduced to happiness and evil is reduced to misfortune. In
modernity, 'evil' is treated as something accidental, something that can
be secured, controlled and ﬁnally eliminated, for example by a culture
of surveillance, insurance and risk assessment.]{.underline}** While
many instances of misfortune may be treatable, perhaps by welfare
spending or international aid, evil is something else entirely: it is,
for Baudrillard, ineradicable, fated to appear and reappear because it
is carried by the medium of the good. Baudrillard appears to postulate
three stages or phases in the relationship of good and evil. [Firstly,
good and evil as symbolic and reversible forms; secondly, good and evil
as metaphysical and dialectical oppositions; and thirdly, the
disappearance of good and evil into the modern binary of
happiness/misfortune]{.underline}. Yet, this is not a historicist
position but a formalist one: good and evil as symbolic forms do not go
anywhere, they are severed, smothered, yet they remain, to take their
revenge on, or through, the culture of happiness/misfortune. **[When
good seeks to totalize itself by eliminating evil, not only does it fall
far short of good but evil returns in catastrophic form]{.underline}**
(Baudrillard, 1990: 181--191**[). If modernity has sought the separation
of good and evil, in order to reify the good and expel evil,
hypermodernity seeks the elimination or obliteration of evil, such that
the distinction between good and evil disappears. Yet these strategies
always fail.]{.underline}** Indeed, Baudrillard oﬀers a number of new
ﬁgures of alterity or heterogeneity, and not all of them are violent or
destructive. For example, his notion of 'radical otherness' refers to
the other in their 'unfathomable singularity', beyond any discursive
comparison, diﬀerence or positioning; an otherness that is not
'understood' by either self or other and is also a dynamic of mutual
seduction (Baudrillard, 1993b: 111--74). **[Here is a new heterogeneity,
one seeming to emerge directly from symbolic and dual relations to the
other, rather than through the viral or hyper-positive eﬀects of
systems. Such alterity or radical otherness, Baudrillard asserts, is
indestructible.]{.underline}**

#### The demarcation of inside/outside reveals 'The Sacred' at the core of society which can never truly be experienced.

Heterology and Transparency: Between Bataille and Baudrillard," Theory,
Culture & Society 2018, Vol. 35(4--5) 175--191) / jTingle

For Bataille, **[systems have no form: they exist through the erection
and maintenance of limits or barriers. The marking of a limit, a line
drawn in the sand, generates the notion of inside and outside, licit and
illicit. On the inside, at the core of society, is the sacred, a
formless monstrosity. The sacred seems to give form to society only by
the drawing of a barrier around it. The barrier keeps sacred and profane
apart on behalf of the profane world.]{.underline}** There is no
opposition or even settled distinction between sacred and profane,
except from the perspective of the profane which sits safely beyond the
realm of the sacred[. The sacred]{.underline}, in Bataille's thinking,
is [a mortal danger to the profane world]{.underline}. So far as the
'sacred nucleus' can be said to have a content, it is that which
disgusts and debilitates most, principally menstrual blood and 'bodily
putrefaction'. Yet such a society, of the dynamic alternation of right
and left poles of the sacred, no longer exists. **[The topology of
sacred and profane, of left and right aspects of the sacred, and of pure
and impure tendencies within the profane, can only be sensed
and]{.underline}**, for Bataille, **['experienced' through its vestigial
forms surviving in modernity.]{.underline}** The narrative oﬀered by
Bataille, and taken up by Baudrillard, concerns the fate of the left
pole of the sacred -- sacred repulsion -- as it is severed from ritual
reversals and alternations, banished and profaned. These are the
grandest of grand narratives, without a trace of the postmodernist style
of writing with which Bataille and Baudrillard are often identiﬁed
(Habermas, 1987; Pefanis, 1991). **[Capitalism, or rather economy
itself, are ﬁgured as the major forces of irreversible
profanation.]{.underline}** [Yet, even more fundamental is the collapse
of the internal duality of the sacred and the profanation of the impure
pole which result in a single and impoverished plane of existence:
'reality'.]{.underline} **[This construct is then subject to further
reduction and homogenization, reaching a condition Baudrillard refers to
as transparency or 'integral reality'.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard,
**[this reduction reintroduces evil, disorder and repulsion in the form
of 'hyper-positivities' as the inevitable or destined revenge of the
object on fragile and vulnerable systems.]{.underline}** [This revenge
or 'blowback of duality' cannot, of course, be relied upon, it does not
arrive in a timely fashion to undo the tyrannies of the powerful**.
Instead, we are left with our hyper-reactions and allergic repulsions to
others, and a strange investment in hatred often lacking an object upon
which to fasten itself**]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1996: 142--7). Yet
Baudrillard's position is not, ultimately, one of despair or resignation
(as claimed by Foss in Frankovits, 1984, for example). **[Duality
is]{.underline}** regarded by Baudrillard as being **[the essence of
collective being or experience, and as inevitable, indestructible, and
never predictable or settled]{.underline}**. The energy of the accursed
share, of heterogeneity and sacriﬁcial expenditure, are still, for
Baudrillard as for Bataille, the fundamental dynamics of social systems,
the core or nucleus disavowed by economic, cultural and technological
institutions. The writings of Bataille and Baudrillard, taken in
conjunction, are more than prescient: they oﬀer rich theorizations of
the social topologies and dynamics of profanation, sacriﬁce and the
heterological; they examine society at moments of crisis and
catastrophe, and, what is perhaps most surprising, they are not conﬁned
by nihilism. The left or impure pole of the sacred cannot be
extinguished, it lives within profanation and thrives upon it.

#### Nuclear war and extermination is ever present -- a notion of absolute ending and speed is what allows us to theorize about makes it possible to think that very archive itself Nuclear war's continual postponement is a key referent, by definition absent, to the living process and the archives of existence and thus it is a signified that does not and cannot pre-exist the text which conjures it up

**[Nuclear war has not taken place Our thinking of being is so affected
by nuclear war as a consequence of two features]{.underline}** which the
latter may be said to possess when it is understood as the referent of a
discourse: **[1) it is always delayed, it will not yet have happened;
and 2) its only existence is rhetorical or textual. It is 'a phenomenon
whose essential feature is that it is]{.underline}** *fabulously
textual*',11 '**[a fable']{.underline}**.12 It depends upon 'structures
of information and communication \[...\] of codes and graphic decoding',
but also '**[to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not
taken place: one can only talk and write about it'.13 Because of nuclear
war's perpetual postponement, it can exist only as the referent of a
certain discourse which speculates about it, and this gives nuclear war
an existence akin to the referent of literature]{.underline}**.
Literature is characterized as 'producing and then harbouring its own
referent'.14 '\[**[N\]uclear war is the only possible referent of any
discourse and any experience that would share their condition with that
of literature.'15 But]{.underline}** Derrida makes an important
specification here, that **[the archive which is supposedly to be
destroyed in nuclear war is 'the juridico-literary archive' and that
this is '\[n\]ot necessarily the destruction of humanity, of the human
habitat, or even of other discourses \[...\]; these latter might
reconstitute their living process and their archive]{.underline}**, at
least to the extent that the structure of this archive (that of a
nonliterary memory) structurally implies reference to a real referent
external to the archive itself ',16 while 'literature produces its
referent as a fictive or fabulous referent that in itself depends on the
possibility of archivisation and that in itself is constituted by the
act of archivisation'.17 Derrida describes this as 'the performative
character of its relation to the referent'.18 As a consequence of its
kinship with literature, nuclear war tells us something important about
textuality itself, and its supposedly secondary place in relation to its
signified and referent. **[Because nuclear war is an event which erases
all traces along with the possibility of reading them, as long as we are
writing and reading such traces, the event signified cannot yet have
taken place. So nuclear war is a referent which is by definition absent,
and thus it is a signified that does not and cannot pre-exist the text
which conjures it up.]{.underline}** And far from being an event that
would finally fulfil the signification of the text itself, or at least
provide an illumination that would do away with the need for such a
text, **[this particular referent would be the erasure of all textuality
and the complete occlusion of sense and revelation]{.underline}**.19
Derrida speaks of 'the presence of this present \[today\] in and through
this fabulous textuality'.20 '"**[Reality", let's say the general
institution of the nuclear age, is constructed by the fable, on the
basis of an event that has never happened]{.underline}**'.21 So the
possible destruction of all textuality might allow us to see that **[the
very notion of a full presence apart from textuality is a
mirage]{.underline}**, not least because the end of all textuality
occurs in a conflagration that leaves no remains, and only absence. The
unique nature of *this kind* of war, as always deferred, allows us to
see the phantasmatic status of the 'always already', the transcendental
presence that we have always been encouraged to see outside of the text,
particularly as philosophers. **[More precisely, a pure presence
(outside the text) and a pure absence (of any text) are both
fantasies]{.underline}**. What deconstruction shows is that each of
presence and absence, along with the very opposition between them, are
derived from textuality and hence not strictly originary. This is why
things are not quite so simple as they would be if the relation between
condition and conditioned had simply been reversed here. For Derrida
says that, in turn, language is itself conditioned by the referent, the
very referent which it was said to have created. **[We speak of 'a total
nuclear war, which, as a hypothesis, or, if you prefer, as a phantasm,
conditions every discourse and all strategies]{.underline}**'.22 This is
the paradox of transcendental conditioning on Derrida's account and it
sheds light on one of the essay's most prominent motifs, to the effect
that **[a moment of absolute ending allows one properly to think the
beginning, even to the extent of making that beginning
possible]{.underline}**. Derrida begins his text with the curious
statement: '**[In the beginning there will have been
speed]{.underline}** \[*Au commencement, il y aura eu la vitesse*\].'23
**[This refers]{.underline}**, in part, **[to the speed of an
ever-accelerating nuclear arms race, a progression towards the potential
destruction of the archive, an event which in its impending makes it
possible to think that very archive itself, including the very discourse
which creates the referent of destruction, which discourse the event
itself in turn makes possible -- this is the mutually conditioning
relation in which the literary text and the literary referent are
entwined.]{.underline}**

Lyotard's essay, 'Can Thought Go On Without a Body?', given as a talk in
1986 and elaborated in 1987, is concerned even more explicitly than
Derrida's with a limit beyond which thought cannot think, and Lyotard at
least opens up the possibility of an event which cannot be sublated and
take on the function of manifestation which Derrida seems ultimately to
bestow upon his apocalypse. With Derrida's nuclear war we were dealing
with a textualized fantasy, which may or may not happen. But **[in the
case of the solar catastrophe, what we are confronted with is not an
artificial fantasy, uncertain or incalculable; we are dealing with a
real referent that is the subject of natural scientific discourse, an
event entirely 'natural', absolutely certain, 'ineluctable', and
precisely calculable]{.underline}**:26 '**[While we talk, the sun is
getting older. It will explode in 4.5 billion years \[...\]. With the
sun's death your insoluble questions will be done with
too]{.underline}**.'27 **[Lyotard contrasts this annihilation with the
death of man in the Hegelian sense,]{.underline}** which will always
involve a certain survival of man and hence the endurance of thought.
[For Lyotard **this death is one which will remain
incomplete**]{.underline}, a determinate negation that is in fact a
survival or resurrection, '**[dead in human terms, \[but\] still capable
of being sublated in thought',28 and not a real death that would be
irreversible and absolute]{.underline}**. The death of the earthly
horizon and bodily support of thought 'is enough to render null and void
your anticipation of a world after the explosion. Political
science-fiction novels depict the cold desert of our human world after
nuclear war. **[The solar explosion won't be due to human war. It won't
leave behind it a devastated human world \[...\] with \[...\] at least a
single survivor, someone to \[...\] write it down.'29 The death of the
sun, and of the living bodies that it nourishes, constitutes a limit
which thought cannot think beyond.]{.underline}** Here Lyotard opposes
Hegel's notion of a limit as something the beyond of which must be
available to us if we are to draw it at all, which implies that **[the
line separating us from our other]{.underline}**, the finite from the
infinite, is sublated or overcome: 'this **[is true of limits belonging
to thought. But after the sun's death there won't be a thought to know
that its death took place]{.underline}**.**['30 Thus this moment of
solar catastrophe restores a bad infinite Hegel thought he could
overcome,]{.underline}** the infinity that remains absolutely distinct
from the finite; more precisely, **[the true infinite and the sublation
of limits characterize only thought, not thought's irreparable
eradication]{.underline}**. For Lyotard, **[the extermination of thought
is a limit Hegelian dialectics can only betray]{.underline}**, a real
event or other of thought, which it can only idealize. Indeed, Lyotard
goes on to say: '**[There's no sublation or deferral if nothing
survives.'31 'Human death is included in the life of the human mind.
Solar death implies an irreparably exclusive disjunction between death
and thought: if there's death, then there's no thought. Negation without
remainder.'32]{.underline}** Lyotard makes it clear that **[to attempt
to think how thought can go on even in the absence of a sun, earth and
body is precisely to try and imagine how thought can survive the
disaster]{.underline}**: 'Thought without a body is the prerequisite for
thinking of the death of all bodies, solar or terrestrial, and of the
death of thoughts that are inseparable from those bodies.'33 Lyotard's
essay is divided into two voices, describing two opposed positions,
described by the sexuated terms 'HE' and 'SHE'. Here, 'HE' is speaking,
and addresses a philosopher recognizably influenced by the French
pedagogic tradition of *les trois hâches*, Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger,
which quite explicitly includes Derrida himself.34 Lyotard goes on to
describe two particular ways -- broadly assigned to SHE and HE
respectively, despite the latter broaching the topic of solar death in
the first place -- of refusing to face up to the absoluteness of the
event: '**[this event is ineluctable. So either you don't concern
yourself with it -- and remain in the life of the mind and in earthly
phenomenality \[SHE\] \[...\]. Or else you try to anticipate the
disaster and fend it off \[HE\]]{.underline}**.'35 And **[this latter
means 'simulating conditions of life and thought to make thinking remain
materially possible after the change in the condition of matter that's
the disaster', a task which techno-science had already begun to
pursue.36]{.underline}** 'So the problem of the technological sciences
can be stated as: how to provide this software with a hardware that is
independent of the conditions of life on earth. \[/\] That is: how to
make thought without a body possible.'37 That Lyotard explicitly links
this eponymous notion with HE's position might suggest that this is the
direction Lyotard himself would take. But in fact certain of SHE's
statements to do with the necessity that thought be capable of passively
awaiting an event, which a computer is supposed to be unable to do, seem
equally reminiscent of certain aspects of Lyotard's own work.38 In the
end, Lyotard's thoughts on the matter are left indefinite and in truth
are less important than the question his essay opens up: **[what would a
philosophy be which did not try to fend off the disaster?]{.underline}**
Let us then understand Lyotard as urging us **[to think beyond both
options]{.underline}** presented by the essay itself, **[and to think a
limit beyond which thought cannot go, to consider the difficulty of
thinking the moment at which thought terminates: this is not nuclear
war, however total, as Derrida has demonstrated; it is the death of the
sun. Can thought go along with its own destitution and
ruin?]{.underline}** An understanding of how this might be so is what we
shall suggest is offered to us by the thought of Georges Bataille. One
might think the passage from Derrida, to Lyotard, to Bataille as a
passage from a relatively restricted economy to gradually more general
ones. Derrida takes an absolute disaster to be the effacement of
(almost) all material remnants of humanity; Lyotard thinks the end of
absolutely all traces and all possibility of life and thought. But there
is still a restriction in Lyotard's way of posing the problem. It
remains perhaps too close to Platonic philosophy in assuming that there
is only one sun, and when it is extinguished all phenomenality will have
quit the cosmos: one sun and one planet harbouring sentient life. In
this respect, Lyotard's text follows Nietzsche's breathtaking parable in
'Of Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense' in which the sun turns cold and
consciousness is revealed in all its transience and arbitrariness.39 On
this account, when the unique sun dies, all possibility of generating
new energy -- and expending it -- would have vanished from the universe.
This is to say that Lyotard is thinking not of an economy in which there
would be surplus and expenditure, a 'general economy' in Bataille's
terms, but of a catastrophic event that would eliminate *all* economy,
production and consumption, and issue only in heat-death. **[If one
resituates the sun within the galaxy and a universe that may be presumed
to include innumerable planets upon which sentient life receives
sunlight, one is transposing this restricted economy into a more general
economy in which the death of one sun is only a minor event, which does
not put an end to all economy but only to a certain restricted
economy]{.underline}**, perhaps a philosophical economy which from Plato
to Nietzsche remained convinced that there was but one source of
illumination. **[Bataille directs our thinking to the
cosmos]{.underline}**, a cosmos in which we may think of the death of
the sun and the incineration of the earth and its archives in the
context of a profusion of suns, in a process of general explosion and
extinction. **[We should read the death of the sun and the countless
supernovae currently illuminating the darkest corners of the universe as
necessary moments of waste, sacrifices of accursed planets which have
reached the limits of their growth and must in one final orgiastic
moment of brilliance pass into darkness]{.underline}**. Nevertheless,
Lyotard's text will have given our reading of Bataille a novel
inflection, since Bataille himself is largely concerned with a single
sun, and the surplus energy it imparts, which is ultimately wasted. To
extend this notion, **[we shall think instead of the wasting of the sun
itself]{.underline}**. In this way, **[Bataille's work]{.underline}**
would allow us to escape from our planet and its inhabitants, without
leaving thought behind altogether. It **[would rather allow us to
conceive of a thought which would be capable of thinking the disaster in
a non-Hegelian fashion. Bataille's thought is a thought of pure
non-utilitarian waste, which is associated with an attitude he describes
as 'sovereign',40 unsubordinated to the future, to accumulation, profit
and purpose]{.underline}**. **[The ultimate wastage]{.underline}** of
philosophical thought as productive dialectical memorialization of a
real event **[is the death of the sun, literally and as
metaphor]{.underline}**. **[This absolute negation or disaster is one in
which there is no survival, not even an imaginary one.]{.underline}**
And Bataille will present us with a picture of thought that is capable
of thinking this loss. **[What Bataille gives us is a theory of
self-consciousness that allows us to think the real event of extinction
or disaster without idealization]{.underline}**, a consciousness that
thinks along with the destruction of all objects, which thinks -- or
indeed *carries out* -- loss or expenditure itself, **[without allowing
itself to subordinate that process to some future survival beyond the
disaster: a sovereign consciousness that would be prepared to lose
itself as well as the sun with the energy of which a more servile kind
of thought was nourished.41]{.underline}**

#### Adopt a heterological understanding and embrace the intense confusion inherent in humans. Refuse productivist and utilitarian thinking that attempts to demonize and eradicate all the absurdity and emotion that makes us human

The notion of the heterogeneous as a practice that is radically
unavailable to rational thought and whose unavailability must
nonetheless be articulated as clearly and meticulously as possible has
two basic consequences, which are essential to an understanding of
Bataille's later conception of art. Firstly, **[Bataille argues, it must
be studied through the emotional effect it has on the subject, which
Bataille divides into two basic categories, attraction and repulsion:
'it is possible to assume that the object of any affective reaction is
necessarily heterogeneous\... there is sometimes attraction, sometimes
repulsion']{.underline}** (1985: 142). This implies that [we only become
aware of the heterogeneous through our emotional response to it, which,
however, does not tell us anything about its ontological
status]{.underline}. To make this clear we can once more return to the
example of the universe, a notion to which, from a Bataillean
perspective, **[three responses are possible: scientific, religious and
heterological. A scientific analysis of the universe would tell us
something about its basic properties, such as atomic and subatomic
particles, the laws governing its emergence and development, and its
future trajectory. A religious interpretation would see in its magnitude
the mysterious presence and power of god, its creator. Both responses,
scientific and religious, thereby introduce a reassuring regularity,
stability or purpose.]{.underline}**5 **[A heterological approach, on
the other hand, would attempt to intensify, or at least acknowledge, the
extreme confusion, absurdity or even horror the notion of an infinite
space, without direction or purpose, might produce, a response which
science or religion are designed to assuage.]{.underline}** Thus, [in
opposition to traditional philosophical theories]{.underline} (Bataille
here explicitly refers to Kantian metaphysics) [that accommodate the
unknowable by establishing a 'sufficient identification \... of an
unknowable (noumenal) world with the known (phenomenal)
world']{.underline} (1985: 96) to keep the disruptive force of the
aporetic to a minimum, **[heterology wants to sustain and intensify this
disruption]{.underline}**. This does not mean, however, that Bataille
rejects science and philosophy tout court. But [the reason why he calls
for a heterological investigation in the first place lies in his
realization that]{.underline} **[their sobriety and ineluctable
interpretative schemas preclude an emotive, fantastical, unreasoned and,
in a sense, liberated response to life and existence]{.underline}**:
[Philosophy has been up to this point, as much as science, an expression
of human subordination, and when man seeks to represent himself, no
longer as moment of a homogeneous process -- of a necessary and pitiful
process -- but as a new laceration within a lacerated nature \... he can
no longer recognize himself in the degrading chains of logic, but he
recognizes himself instead \... in the virulence of his own
phantasms]{.underline}. (1985: 80) **[The heterogeneous]{.underline}**,
conceived of as phantasmic and impossible, not only **[eludes rational
apprehension but also]{.underline}**, significantly, **[resists every
form of utilitarian appropriation]{.underline}**. This aspect is again
only comprehensible in relation to what it negates. Bataille argues that
[within the realm of scientific/philosophical homogeneity 'each element
must be useful to another]{.underline} without the homogenous activity
ever being able to attain the form of activity valid in itself ' (1985:
138). That is to say, **[every element in a scientific equation or a
philosophical proposition]{.underline}** (or in any coherent account of
life and existence for that matter) **[must serve a function in relation
to the overall structure, in which all redundancy and confusion have to
be eradicated]{.underline}**. **[The heterogeneous]{.underline}**, on
the other hand, always describes an element that does not serve an
overall project or theory, that exists for its own sake only, 'valid in
itself', and thus **[implicitly challenges the very notion of coherence
and utility]{.underline}**. Returning to our example of the
heterogeneous universe, it becomes clear that the latter, 'conceived of'
as an infinite, formless **['space', cannot be utilized for the
constitution of a system, cannot be instrumentalized, not even
abstractly; it is fundamentally senseless and useless: 'the universe
answers no purpose that reason defines']{.underline}** (Bataille, 1986:
40).

#### Our strategy of \[poetry/art/music/whatever the performance is\] is the sovereign art that creates aesthetic affect IN THIS ROOM that compels us to reject responsibility and reasonability and live our lives to the fullest.

Bataille's postwar **[reconfiguration of the heterogeneous as aesthetic
immediacy is concurrent with a renewed focus on the social meaning or
function of art, literature and poetry]{.underline}**. In Literature and
Evil, from 1957, **[poetry is defined as 'the means by which \[man\] can
escape from being reduced to the reflection of things']{.underline}**,
in other words, as [an escape from the homogenizing and objectifying
discourses of science and philosophy]{.underline}. However, ['the very
means of avoiding reduction to the reflection of things constitute a
desire for the impossible']{.underline} (2006b: 45). **[Sovereign
art,]{.underline}** as it is developed in Bataille's later work, **[is a
conscious display of its illusory character, a medium which addresses
and answers this desire for the beyond of objectivity without, however,
charging it with a specific truth content or telos]{.underline}**. Yet
sovereign art not only addresses itself to this need but also, due to
its fictional, unreal, phantasmic nature, ultimately reveals the
impossibility of ever satisfying it. Connecting Bataille's earlier work
on the heterogeneous with his later reflections on sovereignty, one
could thus claim that **[the purpose of sovereign art lies in the
dramatization of both the desire and the inevitable failure to ever
access the heterogeneous; it provides an experience of radical alterity,
which is simultaneously an experience of its (logical)
impossibility]{.underline}**. As Carolyn J. Dean aptly describes it:
['The heterogeneous or other can thus be rendered only as art, as
spectacle, through a mimetic gesture that gives expression to its
unassimilable forces']{.underline} (1992: 229). Bataille's conception of
sovereign art, as something that essentially withdraws from discourse,
exhibits certain similarities with Graham Harman's object-oriented
ontology, which claims that the essential feature of all objects lies in
their withdrawal from or unavailability to precise or exhaustive
definition. In an essay on the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, Harman argues
that [philosophy and art are similar in that they both probe but never
fully explain this withdrawal]{.underline} (see Harman, 2008). While
Harman's account is illuminating regarding the potential strangeness of
all objects, he nonetheless fails to consider that philosophy, by
systematizing this strangeness, inevitably reduces it. It thereby (to
use Bataille's diction) deprives the strange of its heterogeneous
character. In the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, the
strange, uncanny or heterogeneous can be experienced because they are
not subsumed within a general theory of strangeness, which would
immediately diminish the feeling of horror and confusion their stories
so masterfully provoke. **[In order for sovereign art]{.underline}**
(such as the works of Lovecraft**[) to have the desired effect
(confusion, elation, attraction, repulsion, etc.) its aesthetic
sovereignty needs to resist the anaesthetic effects of
theory]{.underline}**. In Bataille's essay on William Blake he clarifies
this point in relation to 'the confusion that is provoked' (2006b: 94)
by the works of the English poet. Here the attempts of criticism and
philosophy to account for this confusion by forcing it into some kind of
conceptual straightjacket are likened to a state of sleep, which always
petrifies and numbs the sovereign power of the work: 'As we try to
escape from it, we pass from waking and awareness of the confusion to
the sleep of logical explanation' (2006b: 94). Bataille's later account
of art is closer to Rancie\`re's delineation of Schiller's aesthetic
theory, which also insists on the radical incongruence between
heterogeneous art and homogeneous thought: '[Free appearance is the
power of the heterogeneous sensible element \... it is foreign to all
volition, to every combination of means and end \... inaccessible for
the thought, desires and ends of the subject contemplating
it']{.underline} (2009: 34). However, unlike Schiller, for whom,
according to Rancie\`re, 'this strangeness\...this radical
unavailability \... bears the mark of man's full humanity and the
promise of a humanity to come, one at last in tune with the fullness of
its essence' (2009: 34), Bataille's conception of sovereign art is
radically divorced from any notion of utopian fulfillment. In the third
part of The Accursed Share, simply entitled Sovereignty, he explains
**[the difference between traditional forms of
sovereignty]{.underline}** (such as the idea of god, the feudal lord or
the fascist leader) **[and his notion of sovereign art: 'Sovereign art
is such only in the renunciation of, indeed in the repudiation of the
functions and the power assumed by real sovereignty. From the viewpoint
of power, sovereign art is an abdication. It throws the responsibility
for managing things back onto things themselves']{.underline}** (1993:
421). In his work of the 1930s, as we have seen, art is rejected because
of its lack of revolutionary or political leverage. In Bataille's later
work **[this lack of efficacy in the socio-political realm becomes the
mark of its sovereignty, of its sovereign rejection of responsibility
and accountability.]{.underline}** Bataille now insists that [the much
decried distance or separation between the artistic and the political
realm in modern society needs to be maintained or even made more
trenchant, as any attempt at fusion would instantly compromise art's
sovereign immediacy, its freedom to celebrate confusion, disorder and
incoherence]{.underline}.11 For this reason **[it should never be
expected to create blueprints or models for a possible future society:
'I have continually placed the present moment against a concern for the
future and for me poetry is defined by concern for the present
moment']{.underline}** (2006a: 86). Conversely, political action is now
placed squarely in the realm of the homogeneous, as it is always guided
by a concern for the future, which, according to Bataille's definition,
is a rational concern. **[Every work of art is always an act 'against
the unacceptable world of rational utility']{.underline}** (2006a: 70),
**[as it is aimed at an experience of immediacy beyond the practical and
future-oriented considerations of everyday life.]{.underline}** However,
'the refusal this involves would gain from not being confounded with the
reasoned refusal of unreasonable conditions of life' (2006a: 70). In
other words, [it would be a mistake to attempt to enlist the
heterogeneous, immediate nature of art and poetry to combat the
'unreasonable conditions of life', as this always requires a sober
analysis of those conditions, devoid of the effusive powers of
attraction and repulsion]{.underline}: 'the mastery of \[intellectual
aptitude\] remains the key to rigorous emancipation' (2006a: 50).
Bataille's postwar insistence on the separation between these two
spheres, the political/rational (homogeneous) and artistic/aesthetic
(heterogeneous), then presents an attempt to solve the immanent
contradiction that surfaced in his initial theory of heterogeneity. If,
as we have seen, the sovereign/heterogeneous is posited as that which
resists instrumentalization (for revolutionary or utopian goals), this
new disassociation is not only warranted but implicit in Bataille's
account of heterogeneity from the very first. He now argues that the
attempt to apply the heterogeneous to the realm of homogeneity, the
immediate to mediating categories, art to politics, constitutes a
disservice to both realms: on the one hand it denies the effusive,
strange, opaque dimension of the sovereign artwork and reduces the
latter to the flatness of a formula or a service rendered: '[In modes of
thought in which the rational and the poetic remain confounded, the mind
cannot elevate itself to the conception of poetic liberty, it
subordinates the instant to some ulterior goal']{.underline} (2006a:
65). On the other hand, to infuse politics with the perplexing power of
the heterogeneous precludes a clearheaded and rational appraisal of the
real conditions of social life, which is a prerequisite for any
meaningful attempt to bring about political change.

#### Marxist theory fails to account for the use of affect that is key to revolutionary spirit they are the force of control trying to adaptively reform. They cede the emotional to facism, creating a dogmatic void that led to the rise of Nazism and Trump.

It is [in 'The Psychological Structure of Fascism']{.underline} that
[Bataille first, and most clearly, developed his investigation into the
successes of fascism]{.underline}. Central to the article is his
delineation of his own very particular usages of the terms 'homogeneity'
and 'heterogeneity'. '[Homogeneity' refers to 'the commensurability of
elements and the awareness of this commensurability.']{.underline} 32
**[Under liberal democracy, the state, along with other 'apparatuses'
ensures the homogenisation of society by 'bringing \[unruly,
heterogenous forces\] under the control of order' through the
reformist]{.underline}**, or as Bataille puts it, **['adaptive' nature
of its underlying political ideology]{.underline}**.33 [This formulation
allows Bataille to elaborate on a process that might, in more Marxist
terminology, be described as alienation: the heterogenous proletarian
being homogenised through 'his' production and usefulness to the
homogenous structure as a whole]{.underline}. Outside the process of
production, the worker remains, by virtue of class origin, heterogenous
to the prevailing system. While [the proletarian and 'his' class
constitute a heterogenous force 'lower' than the homogenous
middle-ground, rulers -- the monarch, or more pertinently, the fascist
leader -- constitute 'exalted and imperative (higher) forms' of
heterogeneity]{.underline}.35 What fascinates Bataille is how these two
heterogenous sectors come to identify with one another. In this
formulation, the origins of two of the misconceptions regarding
Bataille's relation to fascism emerge. Firstly, **[Bataille's disdain
for the homogenous is clear, and he makes no secret of his contempt for
the liberal democracy that structured this homogeneity.]{.underline}**
[This anti-liberal, anti-democratic and anti-homogenous streak, allied
to his endorsement of the heterogenous as such, might easily, and has,
been confused for endorsement of fascism.]{.underline} This is only
exacerbated by his lack of faith in the communisms of his time to truly
unleash these heterogenous forces.36 Given the recent revival of a
discourse clearly distinguishing leftist and liberal politics,
Bataille's disdain for 'the centre ground' seems less jarring today than
it perhaps did at the time. Secondly, [his description of fascist
leadership as a 'higher' heterogenous form has been similarly construed
as endorsement]{.underline}, despite his use of the term to describe
only their position in relation to the homogenous realm. Bataille, in
fact, clearly addresses this point early in the text: **['Obviously, the
use of the words higher, noble, exalted does not imply
endorsement.']{.underline}** In 'Toward Real Revolution' Bataille's
anti-liberal-democratic stance is once again apparent, with reference
made at one point to the 'gangrenous powerlessness of liberal
parliamentary institutions.' 38 [He reserves similar disdain for the
organised communist movements and parties of the period that, in his
eyes, had failed to update their revolutionary programme in light of
historical specificities]{.underline}. He argues that 'today, whatever
their political importance or the proven value of their members, those
parties are merely one of those anachronistic formations which, in the
course of historical development, survive their once favourable
conditions. They may remain formidable; they are almost always
overwhelmed with ineluctable defeat.' 39 The 'mainstream' Marxism of the
day, for Bataille, had lapsed into 'laziness', characterised by 'the
vague notion of a replay of past revolutions'. 40 [The contemporary
orthodox Marxist emphasis on economic determinism accounted only for the
homogenous aspect of the experience of the proletariat: their existence
within production.]{.underline} According to the schema of
homogeneity--heterogeneity developed in 'The Psychological Structure of
Fascism', **[the real revolutionary potential emerged from the outside,
the excluded, the abject, the lower, the heterological, and this was the
realm not of economism, but of affect. This point had been overlooked by
the communist parties in what Bataille saw as their unwavering and
ahistorical adherence to Marxist orthodoxy]{.underline}**. In its place,
[Bataille advocated for an 'affective materialism' which prioritised
desire]{.underline}. As Gavin Grindon notes: 'Though his emphasis on the
base plays on Marxist terminology, this is no economic determinism, but
the determinism of an economy of desire.' 42 Bataille argued that '[the
unity of fascism is located in its actual psychological structure and
not in the economic conditions that serve as its base,']{.underline} 43
and that it had capitalised on this through the deployment of 'new
methods of propaganda fitting to a new situation'. 44 **[The Marxist
failure to account for the revolutionary potential of affect had not
merely rendered their own revolutionary claim impotent, but had cleared
the way for alternative revolutionary forces, not least
fascism.]{.underline}** Furthermore, [in their lack of appreciation for
affect, the left had denied themselves the very possibility of
accounting for the rise of fascism, leaving them utterly incapable of
'counter-attack'.]{.underline} 45 Bataille's scornful prose when
discussing the contemporary left is contrasted with his deferential tone
when describing what he called 'the fact of fascism', which he argued,
'demonstrates what can be expected from a timely recourse to reawakened
affective forces'. 46 Just as his tone regarding the left should be read
as the result of his exasperation at their strategic impotence and
political inefficacy, rather than an ideological disagreement, the
esteem he granted to 'the fact of fascism' derived not from endorsement
of its political ideology, but from an acceptance of its traction. Its
methods and strategies were, for Bataille, to provide food for thought
for a static and anachronistic left on the grounds that they are 'on
principle useful in either of two directions, just as a cannon can be
directed eastward or westward'. 47 This strategic curiosity undergirded
the more appropriative dimension to his engagement with fascism, which,
although nascent in 'The Psychological Structure of Fascism', was
elevated to the level of dogma around his period of involvement with
Contre-Attaque. In 'Toward Real Revolution', Bataille makes quite clear
his endorsement of the strategic 'use for the liberation of the
exploited those weapons that were forged for their greater enslavement'.
In some respects, **[the specifically appropriative aspect of Bataille's
thinking can be compared with more recent arguments on the left
regarding strategy. Audre Lorde famously argued that 'the master's tools
will never dismantle the master's house']{.underline}** -- a fairly
unequivocal rejoinder to Bataille's arguments in 'Toward Real
Revolution'. 49 And the furore that followed [Mark Fisher's various
arguments on what the left might learn from the right -- adopting the
neoliberal think-tank model, and acknowledging that 'the right have been
better postmodernists than us, building successful coalitions out of
heterogenous interest groups']{.underline} -- is eminently comparable to
the controversies surrounding Bataille's own claims.50 Whilst such
comparisons make clear that Bataille's arguments concerning
appropriation are problematic at best, and (from an anti-fascist
perspective) outright dangerous at worst, I argue that this should be
disentangled from the more analytical dimensions of Bataille's
'fascist-fascination', as best exemplified by 51 As Richman has argued:
'If Bataille himself periodically fantasized -- to the point of
attempting to implement -- such effervescent outbursts, it need not
discredit his considerable efforts to understand how and why they
occur.' 52 It is in the context of his thought of community that the
subversive and anti-fascist potential of the analytical aspect of his
engagement with fascism, as well as his fundamental divergence from
fascist politics, becomes most apparent.

#### The permutation is the revolutionary festival, creating a total rupture that throws capitalism into crisis. Only the perm can create affective incentive for the proletariat to riot, resulting in the Potlach economy.

In his notes for 'The Notion of Expenditure', Bataille begins with the
role of production in political economy. He attempts to refine in
concrete terms the Surrealists' more romantic 'war on work' by
attempting to conceive of labour-power beyond and against labour: **[In
a liberated world, the role of production is reduced to a condition of
existence and existence itself begins only from the moment that it does
away with work]{.underline}**...What appears impossible to men that old
bourgeois utilitarian conceptions continue to render servile is destined
to become an immediate demand.26 Yet, in insisting that this productive
power not be theoretically 'reduced to a condition of production',27
[this class-orientated opposition to work eventually comes closer to an
existential opposition to all utility and production]{.underline}.
Insisting on the wholly other, Bataille emphasises expenditure's
originary role in a revolutionary conjuring act. **[The subjective
experience of transgression is broadened to the whole social plane.
Revolution is conceived as a unified moment of the mass refusal of
limits.]{.underline}** Thus, **[social revolution becomes a total
experience of crisis and rupture, rather than a unifying historical
moment of political composition]{.underline}**. [The great evening of
revolution becomes 'the great night when their beautiful phrases will be
drowned out by death screams and riots']{.underline}.28 Looking more
closely at Bataille's particular imagining of this moment of conjuring
from absence offers a means to critically retrace his passage from the
politicisation of affect to this disquieting millenarianism, as it too
reveals a reactive absence at its heart. Bataille's reading of Marxism
in terms of base materialism reached its fullest and most public
expression in his now-famous essay for La Critique Sociale entitled 'The
Notion of Expenditure'. The unorthodoxy of this essay can be gauged from
the fact that it appeared with a disclaimer from Souvarine that 'in many
regards, the author stands in contradiction to the general orientation
of our thought, but a review of research could not prohibit such
deviations'.29 **[Bataille argues that the base materialism of desire
will mean that revolution will take a new and unexpected form. The
revolution will resemble a festival.]{.underline}** [Bataille was not
the first to talk about revolutions vis-à-vis festivals. Beyond the
events' connection in French popular tradition,30 this notion can be
seen to weave the threads of his Nietzschean and Marxian thought
together]{.underline}. Lenin had already recognised the subjective
wellspring of revolution using this image: 'Revolutions are the
locomotives of history, said Marx. **[Revolutions are festivals of the
oppressed and exploited.]{.underline}**'31 Equally, festival as an image
of philosophical transcendence rises time and again in the writing of
Nietzsche. Nietzsche had argued that [festival represented an originary
plenitude of both affect and massed creative labourpower.]{.underline}32
However, beyond these possible metaphorical sources **[the keystone of
Bataille's argument is Marcel Mauss's famous account of a premodern
economy founded not on exchange but on gift-giving]{.underline}**, which
seems to give Bataille's fastening of affect to political economy a
material, social grounding. **[This economy culminates in the festival
of potlatch which Mauss referred to as the 'monster child of the gift
system']{.underline}**.33 [Bataille, displaying his characteristic
affection for aberrant progeny, took up this notion with enthusiasm. But
he went further. After accounting for potlatch's expenditure as aligned
with the 'insubordinate function' of his own base
materialism]{.underline},34 he goes on to assert that: Class struggle...
becomes the grandest form of social expenditure when it is taken up
again and developed, this time on the part of the workers, and on such a
scale that it threatens the very existence of the masters.35 In order to
make sense of Bataille's extrapolation, we must begin with the
historical ambiguities of Mauss's account of potlatch as an indigenous,
transnational practice. The potlatch was not in fact a discrete common
phenomenon. Discussing his sources, David Graeber has argued that Maori
and Kwakiutl gift-economies function on almost diametrically opposed
principles, and furthermore that the Kwakiutl potlatch in itself took
various forms which do not gel with Mauss's account of a universal game
of debt repayment.36 In some later cases, rather than a pre-capitalist
paroxysm of expenditure, these potlatches were made possible by contact
with European market exchange, for example in the use of mass-produced
blankets as the medium of the potlatch. In fact, the term 'potlatch'
itself encompassed an unstable and ill-defined set of Native-American
practices and was in this way and others constituted by a colonial
discourse which named it in order to outlaw it.37 In this way,
**[potlatch's characterisation as an example of the absolute other of
expenditure is a product of its first recognition in colonial terms as
marking a limit of civilisation and beyond]{.underline}**. In this way
Bataille's overdetermined revolution-as-festival sits at the heart of
his Marxism but itself embodies a kind of absence. **[Marx's lumpen and
Mauss's potlatch were both in part the product of reactive
psychologisations of 'other' social forms, which Bataille appropriated
as positive values which he synthesised in his image of
revolution]{.underline}**. The logic that stood behind this image was no
less reactive. [Expenditure referred always to an explosion of repressed
vitality, but Bataille's conception of the particular form of social
effervescence that stood behind his revolutionary potlatch was deeply
ambiguous.]{.underline}

#### We must use the weapons of fascism against the current age of fascism, utilizing the affective energy of the masses against the violent ruling order.

[B]{.underline}ataille would only later offer more specific hints of
what shape a political programme for festive ends could take in his work
with Roger Caillois and Michel Leiris, at their College of Sociology in
the closing years of the 1930s. It is possible to sense in this
explosive theoretical cocktail of Marxism and Surrealism a revolutionary
urgency that reflects the historical circumstances of Bataille's
writing. However, appropriately enough for an approach which depends on
the last chapter of Emile Durkheim's The Elementary Forms of Religious
Life, entitled 'The Ambiguity of the Sacred', there is a deep political
ambiguity in this urgency. At times [Bataille tentatively attempted to
align the poles of political left and right with those of Durkheim's
left and right sacred: Even if it seems that the connections permitting
the association of political left and right with sacred left and right
are disputable, it is a fact that sacred objects, in the same way as
political figures, are never consistently transmuted except from left to
right]{.underline}.38 Caillois, less drawn to revolutionary politics
than Bataille, was later to note **[that the left sacred belonged to
'transgressions against the political or religious order' as much as to
natural disorders]{.underline}**.39 He notes that [the exclusions
suffered by the accursed extended for the Li-K'uei to anyone taking
responsibility for protesting against some aspect of the social
order]{.underline}.40 However, had the College wanted a perfect example
of the social expression of the left sacred in modernity as irrational,
effervescent violence in the streets inspired by myth, they need have
looked no further than the events of Kristallnacht, which were to take
place in November 1938, only fifteen months after the College's first
declarations. Meanwhile, the slogan of the Nazi administrative council
of leisure activities advocated its own programme of 'Strength through
Joy'. Caillois was to note at the time that ['at present, all the
movements that show mythological characteristics display a real
hypertrophy of this festival or ritual function']{.underline}. But his
only examples are ['the Hitlerian movement or the Ku Klux
Klan']{.underline}.41 But Bataille was unswerving. Beyond the College
itself, [the closest Bataille came to a political group orientated
towards these ends was Contre-Attaque, formed with Breton and other
Surrealists to oppose Fascism outside and against the government of the
Popular Fron]{.underline}t.42 He understood the driving origin of the
movement of the Popular Front as the 'emotional resources' which found
expression in its effervescent presence in the streets.43 In the
programmatic declaration he wrote for Contre-Attaque, **[Bataille made
clear their intention: ... to make use of the weapons created by
fascism, which has been allowed to use the fundamental aspirations of
people for affective exultation and fanaticism. But we affirm that the
exaltation... must be placed in the service... of a grandeur quite
different from that of the nationalists]{.underline}**.44 During that
period and since, Bataille has been accused of Fascist tendencies from
various quarters, and vigorously defended from others.45 Most famously,
according to Pierre Klossowski, Walter Benjamin was hostile and wary of
(though also, in Klossowki's account, seriously misunderstanding) the
College's project: 'Benjamin disagreed with us... he wanted to hold us
back from a slippery slope: despite a clearly irreducible
incompatibility, we risked playing out a pure and simple "pre-fascist
aestheticism".'46 It is worth recalling here Benjamin's essay on 'The
Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction', which Klossowski was
translating at the time, and which had already asserted that the
aestheticisation of politics was 'the logical result of fascism'.47
**[Bataille, however, had always stringently opposed the far right. He
overcame his differences with Breton to form the radical antiFascist
group Contre-Attaque, and was one of the first to write to reclaim
Nietzsche from Fascist culture]{.underline}**. From the College's
perspective, not only had **[the Communists fatally overlooked the
potential of affect, but Fascists had meanwhile taken full advantage of
it, to terrible effect]{.underline}**. Indeed, though it put its faith
in Johann Gottfried Herder's notion of 'Volk', rather than the French
anthropological tradition of Durkheim, German Fascism had made its own
activist use of myth. Prior to the College, **[Bataille had already
noted in his 1936 account of organic movements of affect that they have
been more often appropriated by the right than the left. As a result, he
argued that it was a matter of learning from Luitpoldhain: ... we must
know how to appropriate the weapons of our adversaries... We must cease
to believe that methods invented by our adversaries are necessarily bad.
On the contrary, we must, in turn, use those methods against
them]{.underline}**.48 In this light, his celebration of the Popular
Front in the street must be read not existentially, but as a tactical
engagement to marshal the emotional power of the movement's hopes and
anxieties. [We can begin to understand the problems and impasses of
Bataille's conception of affect as revolutionary if we look at his ideas
in context]{.underline}. A brief comparison is helpful here. In
asserting the role of affect within Marxian analyses Bataille had
another striking contemporary. The similarities between his thought and
that of Wilhelm Reich, who was as much an excessive old enemy from
within to the Vienna Circle as Bataille was to the Surrealists, have
often been remarked upon. Bataille's 1933 essay 'The Notion of
Expenditure' has many parallels with the arguments of Reich's 1929 'What
is Class Consciousness?' and 'Dialectical Materialism and
Psychoanalysis'. Both not only make a novel and pioneering turn towards
a revolutionary social psychology, but do so in remarkably similar
terms. [Both understand a potential Marxian account of affect not as a
critique of ideology but as an attempt to outline the organisational
structure of a political economy of desire, extending from their
assertion of the determinate materiality of the forces uncovered by
psychoanalysis]{.underline}. Here is Reich in 1929: **[The urge to dance
is powerful with almost all young people without exception... \[it\] can
be a positive element in the development of class consciousness if the
relationship of politics to private life is solved in a revolutionary
manner: particularly skilful youth group leaders have succeeded in doing
so in Germany on occasion. In Germany today it is the Right which is
reaping the benefit of... the urge to go dancing, for it is they who
organise them.]{.underline}**49 In pursuit of a scientific approach,
both also tend towards a structural biological account of this economy
of vitalism. Bataille not only sometimes nuanced overview, theorises the
revolutionary urge from below, in terms of an irrepressible radicalism
rooted in the bowels of proletarians, but in his lectures for the
College draws on biology's development of organicism as a structuralist
scientific model as well as Durkheim's metaphor of society as composed
of cells and organisms. Reich was even more direct, developing social
and individual analysis side by side. Even more tantalisingly, both use
this framework to make startling analyses of the successes of Fascism
and the failures of the left when it came to the potential of affect as
a political force. Bataille's ['The Psychological Structure of
Fascism']{.underline} appeared in La Critique Sociale in 1933, the same
year as Reich published 'The Mass Psychology of Fascism' at his own
dissident Sex-Pol Press. However, Michel Surya's biography of Bataille
follows Jacques Chatain's claim, made in passing, that Reich, though
Bataille's only equal in the period regarding these issues, was 'a
German he had never heard of and who had never heard of him'.50
Reflecting on La Critique Sociale, Claudine Lautier suggests the reasons
for this: ... [the discussion in France had not taken shape, no doubt
because of the political conservatism of orthodox psychiatry and of the
rejection of Reich and the Freudo-Marxists by the Association of
Revolutionary Artists and Writers and the Communist
Party]{.underline}.51 Yet given the intellectual effervescence of the
1930s, with its numerous overlapping circles and networks of
intellectuals, and La Critique Sociale's connections to both dissident
German Marxists and the Vienna Circle (both milieux in which Reich was
prominent) as well as its interest in 'social questions', it seems
unlikely that Bataille had not at least heard of Reich. And indeed, in
issue eleven of La Critique Sociale, the same issue which featured the
second part of Bataille's 'The Psychological Structure of Fascism',
Reich's La Crise Sexuelle (which, compiling 'The Sexual Revolution' and
'Dialectical Materialism and Psychoanalysis', met with palpable success
in French radical circles)52 was listed under the heading of books
received 'to be reviewed next issue'. But this was to be the last issue
of the journal, so we are left to guess what Bataille, who was a regular
reviewer, might have made of Reich's text. By 1937, though, the
connection had become direct. In the College of Sociology's introductory
lecture, delivered by Caillois and Bataille, Reich's 'The Mass
Psychology of Fascism' was cited as one of the group's formative
influences.53 However, despite the apparent symmetry of their work,
their conclusions differed radically. Reich's attitude towards affect's
role in class composition, in texts such as 'What is Class
Consciousness?', was -- if less ambitious -- certainly more specific,
pragmatic and concrete than Bataille's millennial literary howl. In
1927--1928 Reich travelled through the Vienna suburbs offering free
contraception and popular counselling on sexual and emotional problems,
attempting to link these issues to the wider economic and political
organisation of society. Although equally vitalist, Reich's approach to
Marxian synthesis develops from his analysis of the psychosomatic
function of the orgasm in individuals. Bataille's conception of affect,
meanwhile, was primarily indebted to his Nietzschean engagement with
both Surrealism and the social analyses of Durkheim. **[This conception
of affect can explain both his conception of the working class as lumpen
and his embrace of festival as a moment of orgiastic revolutionary
nihilism. Surrealism had posited desire as a political factor but had
failed to find a meaningful politics for this notion. Bataille took this
crucial turn and gave it both more theoretical consistency and a
historical location. However, he did so in entirely negative terms.
Desire was embraced politically, but was still conceived of as simply
and completely opposed to rationalism.]{.underline}** Attempting to
ground Surrealism's radical impulse, [he had chosen the 'base'
irrational over the rational, reactively inverting Surrealism's values,
rather than overcoming them]{.underline}. As a result, where Breton's
conception of desire led towards hopeless utopianism, that of Bataille
tended towards apocalypse. Crucial to this moment of political ambiguity
was his use of the concept of the sacred. His particular inversion of
Surrealist values was bound to this ambiguous concept. The sacred has
commonly been understood as meaning both 'holy' and 'accursed', but this
interpretation has been seriously questioned by recent scholarship. The
ambivalence of the sacred is first asserted by Robertson Smith, in his
1889 Lectures on the Religion of the Semites, before being picked up ten
years later by Durkheim and Mauss's Essay on the Nature and Function of
Sacrifice, and then most fully explored in Durkheim's 1912 The
Elementary Forms of Religious Life. Before Smith, **[earlier theorists
of social affect had simply asserted the senseless mob-mentality
character of events where the social group takes precedence over the
rational bourgeois individual]{.underline}**. [Michèle Richman describes
how such a perspective was founded on a political fear of the growth of
the 'dangerous' mass of the urban working class]{.underline}. As such,
for Gustave Le Bon, a leading theorist of crowd psychology, socialism
was little more than a form of mass hysteria, and his theory attempts to
exclude the working class as an anonymous mass. He reassuringly argued
that such mass actions as strikes, due to their hysterical, irrational
basis, have little power in the face of rational political institutions:
after removing the leader 'the crowd returns to its original state of a
collectivity without cohesion or force of resistance'.54 Richman argues
of Le Bon and his contemporaries that: [Such texts elide the social
origins of the post-Commune workers' movement in order to characterise
it as an anonymous mass which, irrespective of its particular social
composition, succumbs to predictable psychological laws]{.underline}.55
Smith, however, took a different approach to social affect. In his
analysis, he asserted **[a division in religious affect between this
'left' (divisive, accursed) and a 'right' (unifying, holy) sacred: the
distinction which Durkheim inherits and bequeaths to
Bataille]{.underline}**. Smith does so in order to try and appreciate
the value of affect in primitive societies. However, Giorgio Agamben
argues that the unease of the bourgeoisie in this unstable period still
colours this reading. A similar psychological exclusion takes place but,
this time, anxiety is not directed towards the urban horde, but the
foreign one: These Lectures correspond to the moment in which a society
that had already lost every connection to its religious tradition began
to express its own unease... **[What is at work here is the
psychologisation of religious experience (the 'disgust' and 'horror' by
which the cultured European bourgeoisie betrays its unease before the
religious fact).]{.underline}**56 Agamben argues that this historical
ambivalence came to colour Smith's interpretation of the earlier Latin
terms homo sacer and sacratio, which in fact have their origin in a
particular aspect of Roman law. [This reading of affect from the
political perspective of the colonial bourgeoisie came to dominate
studies of the sacred]{.underline}. This, at best, ambiguous critical
tradition of writing on effervescent social affect was Bataille's
inheritance, through which he would attempt to understand affect as
potentially positive, radical, communifying and as produced from below
by a sovereign political subject (Breton, in his own contributions to
ContreAttaque, ploughed a parallel path using Freud's critique of Le Bon
in 'Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego').57 Bataille had
sensed this potential in Surrealism, but his articulation of it would be
tragically marked by this ambiguity. Working within the negative terms
handed to him, but through them attempting to conceive of a position
beyond them, **[Bataille would bite the bullet of his own logic and,
with apparent perversity, valorise the divisive left sacred for its
unifying right sacred effects]{.underline}**. As such, **[he found
himself celebrating all that was excluded and other, increasingly in and
of itself.]{.underline}** Little wonder, then, that his reading of Marx
[arrived back at an 'irrational' celebration of that excluded anonymous
mass of the lumpenproletariat.]{.underline} In this articulation, **[the
tools of the enemy are transformed into a weapon to turn against them,
but an unwieldy and double-edged one. Bataille's Icarian leap was still
secretly tethered to that which it opposed. His revolution is founded on
a counter-valorisation and a conjoining of the psychologisation of
horror at the urban mass and at the foreign other as equally
irrational.]{.underline}** In one of his earliest formulations, Bataille
draws directly upon a dual inverted valorisation of the colonial other
and the lumpen mob which yet remains Eurocentric and vanguardist:

# Answers to Bataille

## Bataille 

### at bataille: theory of expenditure bad

#### Bataille's theory of expenditure doesn't apply to postmodern consumer capitalism, which is based on massive amounts of consumption and waste -- exactly what Bataille advocates.

**Yang 2000 (**Mayfair Mei-hui, Professor of Anthropology at the
University of California Santa Barbara, has held fellowships at the
Center for Chinese Studies of the University of Michigan, the Chicago
Humanities Institute, University of Chicago, and the Institute for
Advanced Study, Princeton, "Putting Global Capitalism in Its Place:
Economic Hybridity, Bataille, and Ritual Expenditure," Current
Anthropology, University of Chicago Journals)

[Scholars]{.underline} such as Jean‐Joseph Goux
([1998](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1086/317380?cookieSet=1#rf40))
[have pointed to a troubling overlap between Bataille's views on luxury
and sacrificial expenditure and]{.underline} postmodern consumer
[capitalism]{.underline}. [Consumer capitalism is also predicated on
massive consumption and waste rather than on the thrift, asceticism, and
accumulation against which Bataille directed his theory of
expenditure.]{.underline} It exhibits potlatch features in the tendency
for businesses to give goods away in the hope that "supply creates its
own demand"; it collapses the distinction between luxury and useful
goods and between need and desire
(Goux [1998](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1086/317380?cookieSet=1#rf40)).
Unlike modernist capitalism, [postmodern consumer capitalism is driven
by consumption]{.underline} rather than production. Thus, [Bataille's
vision]{.underline} of the ritual destruction of wealth as defying the
principles of accumulative and productive capitalism [does not address
this different phase of consumer capitalism,]{.underline} whose contours
have only become clear since his death in 1962. It seems to me that
despite their overt similarities[, the principles of ritual consumption
and those of consumer capitalism are basically incompatible. If Bataille
had addressed our consumer society today, he would have said that this
sort of consumption is still in the service of production and productive
accumulation]{.underline}, since every act of consumption in the world
of leisure, entertainment, media, fashion, and home décor merely feeds
back into the growth of the economy rather than leading to the finality
and loss of truly nonproductive expenditure[. Even much of modern
warfare is no longer truly destructive but tied into the furthering of
military‐industrial production]{.underline}. Nor, despite its economic
excesses, does our consumer culture today challenge the basic economic
logic of rational private accumulation as a self‐depleting archaic
sacrificial economy
does.[^15^](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1086/317380?cookieSet=1#fn15) Furthermore,
capitalist consumption is very much an *individual* consumption rather
than one involving the whole community or social order.

#### Valorizing expenditure recreates instrumental reason Bataille hopes to escape 

**Wolin, PhD, 04**

(Richard, *Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology* in
[The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from
Nietzsche to Postmodernism]{.underline} )

At times, **[Bataille\'s celebration of transgression for its own sake
seems woefully simplistic. In lieu of a conceptual framework that would
permit one to distinguish between constructive and retrograde instances
of transgression, we are left with an ethos of shock, rupture, and
disruption simpliciter. Bataille seeks to ground postmodern ethics in
the attitudes of a cultural avant-garde]{.underline}** (Acephale and the
College of Sociology) **[oriented toward precapitalist life forms that
modernity has scorned. Yet the very idea of achieving a conceptual
reckoning with Bataille-generated ideals such as \"transgression,\"
\"heterogeneity,\" and \"expenditure\" would seem inimical to their very
spirit]{.underline}**. In his idiom, **[to rely on procedures of
principled legitimation or a rational accountability would be to succumb
to the logic and rhetoric of \"productive consumption\"---the values of
a society predicated on instrumental reason and commodity
exchange]{.underline}**. (165)

#### Expenditure is not transgressive- limitless consumption is useless theory

Paul **Mann**, 19**99,** "The Exquisite Corpse of Georges Bataille" in
[Masocriticism]{.underline}, p. 67-9

I would like at one and the same time to affirm this model and to
dismiss it as [the most desperate alibi of all]{.underline}. For
"[sacrificial consumption]{.underline}" [can never become an explicit
critical motive]{.underline}.13 At the moment it presents itself as a
proper element of some critical method[, it degenerates into another
useful trope, another bit of intellectual currency, another paper-thin
abyss, another proxy transgression]{.underline}; and [the force of
transgression moves elsewhere, beneath a blinder spot in the critical
eye]{.underline}.14 [Questions of motive or understanding]{.underline},
the fact that one might be self-critical or at least aware of
recuperation, [are immaterial]{.underline}: [what is at stake here
is]{.underline} not self-consciousness but economics, [material
relations of appropriation and exclusion, assimilation and positive
loss]{.underline}. Whatever transgression occurs in writing on Bataille
does so only through the stupid recuperation and hence evacuation of the
whole rhetoric and dream of transgression, only insofar as the false
profundity of philosophy or theory evacuates the false profundities it
apes. [To justify this as the sublime loss of loss is merely to indulge
a paradoxical figure]{.underline}. [Excess is not a project but a
by-product of any discourse]{.underline}; [the interest of Bataillean
discourse lies chiefly in the compulsive and symptomatic way it plays
with its feces. The spectacle of critics making fools of themselves does
not reveal the sovereign truth of death]{.underline}: [it is only
masocritical humiliation, a pathological attempt to disavow the specter
of death]{.underline}. As for the present essay, it makes no claims to
any redeeming sacrifice. Far from presenting you with a truer Bataille,
far from speaking in his voice more clearly than his other readers, this
essay pleads guilty to the indictment against every appropriation. Until
philosophy and theory squeal like a pig before Bataille's work, as he
claims to have done before Dali's canvases, there will be no knowledge
of Bataille. [In the end, one might have to take and even stricter
view]{.underline}: [there is no discourse of transgression, either on or
by Bataille]{.underline}. [None at all]{.underline}. It would be
necessary to write a "Postscript to Transgression" were it not for the
fact that Foucault already wrote it in his "Preface," were it not for
the fact that Bataille himself wrote it the moment before he first
picked up his pen. [It makes no difference whether one betrays Bataille,
because one lip syncs Bataille's rhetoric or drones on in the most
tedious exposition]{.underline}. All of these satellite texts are not
heliotropic in relation to the solar anus of Bataille's writing, of the
executioners he hoped (really?) would meet him in the Bois de Boulogne,
or depensives in spite of themselves. It would be sentimental to assign
them such privileges. [They merely fail to fail]{.underline}. [They
are]{.underline} symptoms of a discourse in which everyone is happily
transgressing everyone else and nothing ever happens, [traces of a
certain narcissistic pathos that never achieves the magnificent loss
Bataille's text conveniently claims to desire]{.underline}, and under
whose cover it can continue to account for itself, hoarding its precious
debits in a masocriticism that is anything but sovereign and gloriously
indifferent. [What is given to us, what is ruinously and profitably
exchanged, is a lie]{.underline}. Heterology gives the lie to meaning
and discourse gives the lie to transgression, in a potlatch that reveals
both in their most essential and constitutive relation. [Nothing is
gained by this communication except profit-taking from
lies]{.underline}. [We must indict Bataille as the alibi that allows all
of this writing to go on and on, pretending it is nothing it is not, and
then turn away from Bataille as from a sun long since gone nova, in
order to witness the slow freezing to death of every satellite
text]{.underline}. [The sacrificial consumption of Bataille has played
itself out; the rotten carcass has been consumed: no more
alibis]{.underline}. [What is at stake is no longer]{.underline}
ecstatic sexuality or [violent upheavals or bloody sacrifices under the
unblinking eye of the sun]{.underline}; [nor was it ever, from the very
beginning of Bataille's career]{.underline}. [These are merely figures
in the melodramatic theater of what is after all a]{.underline} "[soft
expenditure]{.underline}" (Hollier 1989, xv), [a much more modest
death]{.underline}, a death much closer to home. [It has never been more
than a question of the death of the theory and of theory itself as
death]{.underline}. Of theory-death. A double fatality.

#### The aff\'s absurd extreme expenditure recreates the SQ

**Plontisky, 95** (Arkady, Professor of English and Theory and Cultural
Studies, Purdue University, "On Bataille: Critical Essays," State
University of New York Press, pg. 111, Tashma)

Indeed, as [Bataille\'s discourse shows]{.underline} with extraordinary
power, it is the [economic insistence]{.underline} on consumption at the
multiple and often interacting levels of theoretical
economies---economic, political, conceptual---that [is]{.underline} most
[problematic. The theoretical problem is a metaphoric loss of the
economy]{.underline} of loss [and thus of the general
economy.]{.underline} It is not that consumption and the pleasure of
consumption are not important or theoretically and otherwise
pleasurable. **[To reverse the configuration]{.underline}** absolutely
and to privilege expenditure unconditionally **[would be]{.underline}**
just as **[untenable]{.underline}**. As I indicated earlier,
[Bataille\'s heavy insistence on]{.underline} waste and [expenditure
must be seen as problematic]{.underline} in this respect and is
\"saved\" only by the enormous labyrinthine complexity of Bataille\'s
inscription of these concepts.

#### Their sacrifice is insignificant- can\'t change relationship to death

It Is Not Sacrifice," April 25, [2007]{.underline}**,**

What Nancy admits is that "strictly speaking we know nothing decisive
about the old sacrifice" and that "the Western economy of sacrifice has
come to a close...it is closed by the decomposition of the sacrificial
apparatus itself" (Nancy, 35). These confessions are significant because
it indicates the fear that Nancy has of appropriating a symbol which has
a remainder and a vector he cannot predict or control. [What Bataille
wanted from sacrifice was one thing, but]{.underline} Nancy fears that
[sacrifice carries its own valence. It is like the art that accedes to
extinction,]{.underline} but suspends above it indefinitely. [The force
to accede to extinction is not guaranteed to suspend.]{.underline} [The
force that Bataille borrows from sacrifice is not guaranteed to behave
in the way atheism dictates]{.underline}. Nancy reasserts that Western
sacrifice always knew it sacrificed to nothing, but this latent
knowledge makes the institution of sacrifice absurd, and Nancy is not
willing to deny that sacrifice "sustained and gave meaning to billions
of individual and collective existences" (Nancy, 35) What Nancy fears is
this ignorance. He knows he does not understand the significance of the
old sacrifice. If sacrifice was to no one and everyone knew it; why was
and is it so universal and why have so many been tempted into believing
its significance? But [if one assumes that there is no one to whom one
sacrifices, Bataille may not use sacrifice as the centerpiece of his
philosophy because if sacrifice is not to anyone, it is not truly
significant.]{.underline} If it is not significant or meaningful, it has
no power. It becomes comedic. [And it becomes massacre.]{.underline}
[That is why Nancy spends much of his time talking about the sacrifice
of the Jews at Auschwitz.]{.underline} [Without over-determining the
significance, the sacrifice becomes a genocide or a holocaust. Bataille
is trapped]{.underline} between two uncomfortable positions---[let the
blood continue to spill to make sacrifice real]{.underline} and
significant and concrete, [or deny the death the status of sacrifice,
which]{.underline} in Bataille's mind, [would be to deny it
realization.]{.underline} [Nancy asks if Bataille's "dialectical
negativity expunges blood or whether, on the contrary, blood must
ineluctably continue to spurt]{.underline}" (Nancy, 27). [If Bataille
spiritualizes sacrifice, it no longer has the power of real death, the
concreteness of finiteness and the ability to rupture finitude. But if
Bataille insists on the real death, he necessitates the constant
spilling of blood in mimetic repetition until history is completed in
the Sage]{.underline}

### at bataille: no link to modern capitalism

#### Bataille doesn't apply to modern capitalism, which is already based on excessive consumption and desire.

**Goux et al 90** (Jean-Joseph, the Lawrence Favrot professor of French
and chair of French studies at Rice University, Kathryn Ascheim, PhD and
editor of *Nature Biotech*, Rhonda Garelick, taught at Yale, University
of Colorado at Boulder, and Columbia, critic of literature and politics,
PhD in comparative literature, "General Economics and Postmodern
Capitalism," Yale French Studies No. 78 On Bataille, pp. 206-224)

[Where do we situate Bataille's claim?]{.underline} What happens to the
demand of the sacred in capitalist society? [How do we reconcile the
affirmation that capitalism represents an unprecedented break with all
archaic]{.underline} \[precapitalist\] forms [of
expenditure]{.underline} and the postulate of the necessary universality
of spending as pure loss? [This is the difficulty Bataille wants to
maintain]{.underline} as a general anthropological principle the
necessity of unproductive expenditure while simultaneously upholding the
historic singularity of capitalism with regard to this expenditure.
Bourgeois society corresponds to a "general atrophy of former sumptuary
processes" (41). An anomaly whereby loss is not absent (which would
contradict the general principle) but virtually unreadable: "Today, the
great and free social forms of unproductive expenditure have
disappeared. Nevertheless, we should not conclude from this that the
very principle of expenditure is no longer situated at the end of
economic activity" (37). So what happens to ostentatious expenditure in
capitalism? And [can we really believe,]{.underline} furthermore, [that
the even more radical desacralization effected by communism could become
a libertarian affirmation of sovereignty]{.underline} -- the feast of
self-consciousness, without divinities and myths? Everything suggests
that [Bataille was unable to articulate the mystical tension toward
sovereign self-consciousness]{.underline} "without form and mode," "pure
expenditure" (224) with a utopia of social life that would make it
possible, nor to explain in a *developed* capitalist society the
consumption of the surplus beyond its reinvestment in production. Now it
is quite clear that [today's capitalism has come a long way from the
Calvinist ethic that presided at its beginning. The values of thrift,
sobriety, and asceticism no longer have the place that they
held]{.underline} when Balzac could caricature the dominant bourgeois
mentality with the characters of pére Grandet or the usurer
Gobseck[.]{.underline} It is doubtful that the spirit of capitalism,
which according to Weber is expressed with an almost classical purity in
Benjamin Franklin's principles \["he who kills a five shilling coin
assassinates all that it could have produced: entire stacks of sterling
pounds"\] \[cited by Bataille, 163\], could today be considered the
spirit of the times. Undoubtedly[, the pace at which all residual sacred
elements inherited from feudalism are eliminated has quickened. but
hasn't contemporary society undergone a transformation of the ethic of
consumption, desire, and pleasure that renders the
classical]{.underline} \[Weberian\] [analyses]{.underline} of the spirit
of capitalism \[to which Bataille subscribes\] [inadequate?]{.underline}
If the great opposition between the sacred and the profane no longer
structures social life, if communal, sacrificial, and glorious
expenditure has been replaced by private expenditure, it is no less true
that advanced capitalism seems to exceed the principle of restricted
economy and utility that presided at its beginning. No society has
"wasted" as much as contemporary capitalism. What is the form of this
waste, of this excess?

### at bataille: no alt solvency

#### Bataille believes human sacrifice is the ultimate form transgression- this proves his alt is awful.

**Pavlovski 2005** (Linda, editor for the database Enotes and of
multiple academic collections, "Bataille, Georges: Introduction,"
Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism,
<http://www.enotes.com/twentieth-century-criticism/bataille-georges>)

Bataille sought "sovereignty" through loss of self, which is achieved
through transgression and excess, notably through laughter, religious
ecstasy, sacrifice, eroticism, death, and poetry. [Considering human
sacrifice the ultimate transgression, Bataille was fascinated by
religious feast days that included rites of sacrifice]{.underline}. This
fascination led Bataille to the work of the anthropologist Marcel Mauss
and to a particular interest in the cultures of the Aztecs and North
American [Indians. In their use of human sacrifice and potlatch,
respectively, Bataille saw an excessive, generous spirit which he
admired]{.underline}. As a direct result of this, [Bataille wrote an
unconventional theory of economics that promoted waste and excess,
rather than acquisition. Believing that transgression existed beyond
mere words, Bataille constantly battled with the problem of
writing]{.underline} the inexpressible.

#### Bataille's reasoning justifies atrocities and death.

**Boldt-Irons, 2000** (Leslie Anne, Associate Professor of French
at Brock University, "Military discipline and revolutionary exaltation:
the dismantling of "l'illusion lyrique" in Malraux's L'Espoir and
Bataille's Le Bleu du Ciel," Romantic Review, vol. 91 issue 4, p. 481)

In 1933, Bataille contributed a review of André Malraux's novel *La
Condition humaine* to the ultra left-wing journal *La Critique
sociale.*^1^ In this article, [Bataille questions the place that
revolution occupies in the larger]{.underline} and more general [context
of "human agitation]{.underline}." [He asks]{.underline}, for example,
[whether]{.underline} the convulsive movements [of revolt, social
upheaval, and revolution should be situated outside of]{.underline}, or
above, [what is normally experienced as life in its]{.underline}
quotidian [expressions of tenderness, enthusiasm or even hate. In the
name of what authority]{.underline}, for example, [might one be
justified in placing the fascination with pleasure, torture and possible
death *outside* the limits of acceptable social practice]{.underline} --
extreme states often linked to revolutionary upheaval *outside* the
limits of acceptable social practice? Another way of situating the
convulsion of revolutionary movements -- [an approach clearly endorsed
by Bataille -- is to place it]{.underline} squarely [within the
framework of *any* activity marked by agitation. From this perspective,
the acts of torture and murder would arise from an
excitability]{.underline} or arousal [similar in nature to that
intensifying the fury of the revolutionary impulse. This
impulse,]{.underline} writes Bataille, [is a means by which the
proletariat]{.underline} -- who had for a long time been deprived of the
possibility of attributing any value to suffering and to life [-- is
able to gain access to *value* itself,]{.underline} a value linked to
states of excitation [unsubordinated to any simple political means or
end]{.underline}. This value, and the state of agitation to which it is
linked, gives the proletariat both life and hope, for which [even death
in all its atrocity might be the payment required.]{.underline}

(John, "Loss and Sacrifice in the Thought of Georges Bataille (And their
Political Implications),"

While it is certainly the case that **[Bataille's position
does]{.underline}** require some sort of re- working of our practices
(or perhaps more importantly, the way in which we understand those we
currently have) in order to accommodate the experience of sacrificial
loss, this does **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[entail a complete
upheaval of]{.underline}** society and **[politics]{.underline}**. As
disruptive as sacrifice may be to the stable and logical forms which
tend to comprise profane existence, **[it does not seem to be the case
that Bataille is recommending]{.underline}** that **[we]{.underline}**
simply **[overturn all things profane]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[Bataille specifically argues against such actio]{.underline}**n
where, in Guilty, he says, **[Life is a result of]{.underline}**
disequilibrium and [**instability.** Stable forms are needed to make it
possible however]{.underline}....To shrink from fundamental stability
isn't less cowardly than to hesitate about shattering it. [Perpetual
instability is more boring than adhering strictly to a
rule]{.underline}, and only what's in existence can be made to come into
disequilibrium, that is, to be sacrificed. The more equilibrium the
object has, the more complete it is, and the greater the disequilibrium
or sacrifice that can result (Bataille 1988b, 28-29). Perhaps the most
important insight to take from this quote is that sacrifice (here
emphasized as **[that which disrupts]{.underline}** what is) [depends
upon the logical and stable forms **that are marks of**]{.underline} the
profane world of work and **[utility]{.underline}**. Because sacrifice
might be said to represent a transgression of the norms of the profane
world, it follows that these norms must exist in order for such a
transgression to occur in the first place. While I have been emphasizing
the importance for Bataille of sacrificial loss (and to the extent that
it follows from it---disruption), in this passage he seems to be
affording some sort of recognition to the importance of values like
stability, that are associated not with the sacred but rather the
profane.

#### The alt fails --

**Arnould,** lecturer -- Johns Hopkins U, **'96**

(Elisabeth, The Impossible Sacrifice of Poetry: Bataille and the Nancian
Critique of Sacrifice," Diacritics 26.2)

Sacrifice is unquestionably the most prominent model in Bataille\'s
thinking of finitude. But it is also, if one accepts Nancy\'s
allegations, the most problematic. **[While hoping to find
in]{.underline}** the exemplarity of **[sacrifice a new paradigm for the
thinking of finitude]{.underline}**, Nancy explains in \"The
Unsacrificeable,\" **[Bataille does nothing but resubmit this finitude
to the most traditional determinations]{.underline}** of ontotheology.
Sacrifice remains, in Bataille\'s thought, a deficient model for
finitude insofar as it continues to be conceptually dependent on
traditional philosophical and Christian interpretations of sacrifice.
Thus, Nancy asserts that **[the characteristic valorization Bataille
grants to the finite and cruel]{.underline}** moment of immolation in
his rethinking of sacrifice **[does nothing but repeat]{.underline}**,
by simply inverting its valence, **[the classical interpretation
of]{.underline}** an occidental **[sacrifice that conceives itself as
the ideal sublation]{.underline}** of this same moment. The
philosophical and Christian version of sacrifice is understood as the
spiritual transformation of a sacrificial moment the finite nature of
which it denounces even as it appropriates its power. The Bataillian
version, on the contrary, insists upon this finite moment in order to
escape the dialectical comedy that transforms sacrifice into an ideal
process. **[Performed in the name of spiritual rebirth, the sacrifices
of]{.underline}** Plato and **[Christ]{.underline}**, for instance,
**[reappropriate death by transfiguring it as
resurrection.]{.underline}** Grotesque and replete with horrors,
**[death in Bataille appears alone on a stage whose cruelty is neither
explained nor redeemed]{.underline}** through transfiguration. Thus,
Bataille withholds nothing from the scene of sacrifice but lets it
emerge in the fullness of its amorphous violence. He valorizes its
sanguinary horror in order to denounce the dialectic idealization of a
death nothing should domesticate. **[He exhibits it \"as it is\":
opaque, silent, and without meaning]{.underline}**. According to Nancy,
**[however,]{.underline}** **[the valorization itself remains caught in
the sacrificial logic of the idealist tradition]{.underline}**. For, he
argues, only in light of its ontotheological conceptualization can
sacrifice become at once the infinite process of dialectical sublation
and the blood-spattered moment this process both negates and sublates,
simultaneously \[End Page 87\] avers and contests. The Bataillian
thesis, granting efficacy and truth (reality) to sacrificial cruelty, is
irremediably linked to the processes of dialecticization and
spiritualization through which the philosophical and Christian West
appropriates the power of sacrifice. It is the cruel counterpart of its
idealization. And if this conception gives to sacrificial death an
importance proportionally opposite to that which it receives from the
Christian and philosophical transfiguration\--since the finite truth of
death plays at present the role of the infinite truth of
resurrection\--it still does nothing but repeat its ontotheological
scheme. For **[it]{.underline}** also **[pretends to find, on the cruel
stage of sacrifice, a singular and more \"real\" truth]{.underline}** of
death. The stage of the torment is, for Bataille, that place where death
appears with the full strength of a nonmeaning that can be exposed only
through the immolation of the sacrificial victim. If this is so, then
should we not suppose that this immolation pretending to give us the
\"inappropriable\" truth of death\'s rapture appropriates in its turn
the excess of the \"excessive\" meaning of this rapture? **[Does it not
transform its excess into an \"excessive truth,\"]{.underline}** to be
sure a negative one, though **[no less absolute than the philosophical
and spiritual truths to which it opposes itself]{.underline}**? At the
heart of modern theories of sacrifice is thus, as Nancy puts it, a
\"transappropriation of sacrifice\" by itself, even when, as is the case
for Bataille, this theory tries to overcome sacrifice\'s spiritual
operation through an excessive and volatile negativity. **[As soon as
sacrifice thinks itself as revelation]{.underline}**, be it that of a
spiritual beyond or its negative counterpart, **[it remains a sacrifice
in the name of its own transcendence]{.underline}**, a loophole to a
finitude powerless to think itself in terms other than those of a
revelation: the revelation of a clear or obscure god, symbol of
resurrection or of death\'s blind horror. If one wants to think finitude
according to a model different from that of its sacrificial
appropriation, one should think \"apart from\" sacrifice. If finitude
is, as Bataille has himself wanted to think, an \"access without access
to a moment of disappropriation,\" then we must also call it
\"unsacrificeable\" \[Nancy 30\].

#### This is too complicated for them to answer.

**Arnould,** lecturer -- Johns Hopkins U, **'96**

(Elisabeth, The Impossible Sacrifice of Poetry: Bataille and the Nancian
Critique of Sacrifice," Diacritics 26.2)

But **[if finitude]{.underline}** thus **[appropriates itself in a
self-sacrifice that reveals its truth]{.underline}**, if **[it
becomes]{.underline}** \"its own subject,\" how can we, once again, make
a difference between **[the]{.underline}** philosophical, **[Christian
version of sacrifice]{.underline}** and the modern Bataillian
interpretation? **[Do they not entertain th]{.underline}**e same
**[goal: mastery of the unthinkable excess of finitude?]{.underline}**
And **[do they not both pretend to manifest a truth]{.underline}** of
the experience of nonknowledge: a truth that is, on the one hand, that
of an ideal or divine resurrection and, on the other, a purely immanent
but nonetheless presentable reality of death? The figure of a
self-immolating Rimbaud and the inner experience it embodies are,
intentionally or not, analogous in design and purpose to the
ontotheological figures of the idealist and dialectical tradition. And
**[this particular sacrificial figure is all the more suspect in that it
recasts]{.underline}** and replays **[the]{.underline}**
much-talked-about \"**[sacrifice of poetry\" constitutive of the Western
philosophical tradition]{.underline}**. It is scarcely necessary to
remind the reader that the emblematic scene of the birth of philosophy
in the West has traditionally been represented both by the sacrifice of
the poet in the public square and the legendary tale of self-sacrifice
depicting young Plato burning his poems. Now,
**[Bataille]{.underline}**, it would seem, **[is merely reproducing
these scenes]{.underline}**. His version resituates the immolation of
poetry in the context of a nonknowledge, but this new context does not
alter the fundamental identity of the meaning and purpose of these
sacrifices. **[Plato\'s sacrifices sought to demonstrate that
truth]{.underline}**, though hidden, **[is accessible]{.underline}**
through the sacrificial machination of a philosophical dialectic.
**[Similarly, Bataille reasserts that finitude]{.underline}**, though
absent, **[is accessible]{.underline}** through the negativity and
self-immolation of the experience. Just as Plato and Socrates informed
us that, in order to obtain the idea in its purity, it must first be
abstracted from the verbiage of representational falsification by way of
sacrificing the falsifier, the mimetician, so Bataille informs us that
only a sacrifice of poetry will allow the experience to achieve the
inner void of its nonknowledge. Hence, the experience separates its
\"inner\" truth from a poetic exteriority that could only \"simulate,\"
as Bataille himself often writes, \"its absence.\" And it is as this
inner \"presence-to-itself of absence\" (\"présence-à-soi de
l\'absence\") that Bataille seems to be conceptualizing finitude.
**[Finitude is the \"impossible presence\" that one must preserve and
purify through a renewed sacrifice of meaning. How can we thus avoid
thinking that such an experience]{.underline}**, intent upon wresting
its finitude from the bad repetition of a mimesis, not only **[misjudges
the nature of finitude]{.underline}** but also the nature of a poetry
whose \"mimetic imposture\" could actually, as Nancy says, teach us a
few things about the \"impossible\"\--or \"inappropriable\"\--nature of
finitude itself.

**Wolin, 2006** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at
the [City University of New
York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York) Graduate
Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German
Ideology"Constellations vol. 2 issue 3, pp. 397-428)

[In the worldview of both Bataille and that of German young
conservatives, war plays an essential, positive role]{.underline}. It
serves as a means of dissolving the *principium individuationis*: the
principle of a bourgeois subjectivity, on which the homogenous order of
society - a world of loneliness and fragmentation -- depends. [For,
according to Bataille, "the *general* movement of life is\...
accomplished beyond the demands of individuals."^32^ It is in precisely
this spirit that he celebrates the non-utilitarian nature of "combat" or
"war" as a type of aestheticist end in itself:]{.underline}
"*Glory\...*expresses [a movement of senseless frenzy, of measureless
expenditure of energy, which the fervor of combat
presupposes.]{.underline} Combat it glorious in that it is always beyond
calculation at some moment."^33^ For the same reasons, Bataille
eulogizes those premodern "warrier societies in which pure, uncalculated
violence and ostentatious forms of combat held sway."^34^ [For under
such conditions, war]{.underline} was not made subservient to the vulgar
ends of enterprise and accumulation, as is the case for modern-day
imperialism, but [served as a glorious end in itself. Yet in the early
1930s, it was precisely this aestheticist celebration of "violence for
violence's sake," or "war for war's sake," that Benjamin viewed as the
essence of modern fascism]{.underline}. As he remarks in a well known
passage: "*Fiat ars -- pereat mundus*," says fascism, and, as Marinetti
admits, expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense
pereption that has been changed by technology\...[Mankind]{.underline},
which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian
gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation [has reached such a
degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of the first order]{.underline}. This is the situation of
politics which fascism is rendering aesthetic.^35^ [In Bataille's
thought war serves as the harbinger of a cultural transfiguration in
which the primacy of self-subsistent subjectivity would be replaced by
the values of an]{.underline} "unavowable" or "[ecstatic
community":]{.underline} that is, a community that would no longer be
governed by the goals of a "visual culture" -- transparency,
self-identity, etc. -- but instead, those of self-laceration,
difference, and finitude[. In fact this Bataille-inspired program of an
ecstatic community has been quite explicitly carried forth and
explored]{.underline} in the political writings of Maurice Blanchot (*La
Communaute inavouable;* 1983) and Jean-Luc Nancy (*La Communaute
desoeuvree;* 1985).

#### Bataille's philosophy emphasizes the destruction of war and conflict

**Wolin, 2006** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at
the [City University of New
York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York) Graduate
Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German
Ideology"Constellations vol. 2 issue 3, pp. 397-428)

Moreover, [the cultural attitudes of]{.underline} both Spe\\ngler and
[Bataille are linked by an aesthetics of violence that is highly
characteristic of the "front generation."]{.underline} In a key passage
in *The Decline of the West*, Spemgler, depicting the "life-world" of
blood and instinct that had been repressed by the Faustian spirit of
modernity, observes: "[War is the primary politics of *everything* that
lives and so much so that in the depths battle and life are
one]{.underline}, and being will-to-battle expire together."^28^
Similarly, for Junger, "[War is an intoxication]{.underline} beyond all
bonds. It is a frenzy without cautions and limits comparable only to the
forces of nature."^29^ [Bataille]{.underline} (the meaning of his name
in French should be recalled), too, [is convinced that "conflict is
life. Man's value depends on his aggressive strength. A living man
regards death as the fulfillment of life]{.underline}; he does not see
it as misfortune. \...[I MYSELF AM WAR.]{.underline}"^30^ As Jay
observes in this connection: "on a deeper level, the war [\[World War
I\] seems to have exercised a certain positive fascination \[on
Bataille\]. For it is striking that many of Bataille's obsessive themes
would betray an affinity for the experiences of degradation, pollution,
violence, and communal bonding]{.underline} that were characteristic of
life in the trenches."

### at bataille: fascist

#### Bataille was an admirer of fascism and believed it was the noblest form of political rule.

**Wolin, 06** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at the [City
University of New
York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York) Graduate
Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German
Ideology"Constellations vol. 2 issue 3, pp. 397-428)

Here, the analysis must begin with an examination of Bataille's essay,
"The Psychological Structure of Fascism," often rightly hailed as a
theoretical breakthrough in our understanding of the mass psychological
appeal of modern authoritarian rule. Yet, the essay also contains a
barely veiled admiration for the vitality and energy of the existing
fascist states, especially when contrasted with the decadence and
inertia of the contemporary European democracies. Bataille purveys a
critique of parliamentarianism that is as zealous as anything one finds
in the work of Carl Schmitt. Parliamentary decision-making, he claims,
partakes wholly of the order of the homogenous. It aims solely at
co-optation, the elimination of difference. As such, it is purely
instrumental and serves primarily to suppress the breakthrough of
heterogeneous elements that threaten to explode the normative bases of
the given economic and political order. As Bataille observes, in a
striking anticipation of Jean-Francois Lyotard's association of
"consensus" and "terror": "The reduction of differences in parliamentary
practice indicates all the possible complexity of the internal activity
of adaptation required by *homogeneity.*^60^ [Bataille can perceive no
fundamental differences between the conduct of political and economic
life in modern democratic societies, insofar as both are examples *par
excellence* of homogeneity]{.underline} -- this despite the fact that
discussion aims at mutual understanding, whereas economic activity is
goal-oriented and utilitarian. [Given this curt dismissal of the
institutional bases of democracy, it comes as little surprise that
Bataille glorifies the role played by fascism in modern political life
as a type of breakthrough of the heterogeneous.]{.underline} [For
Bataille, "the fascist leaders are incontestably part of heterogeneous
existence. Opposed to democratic politicians, who represent in different
countries the platitude inherent to *homogeneous* society, Mussolini and
Hitler immediately stand out as something *other*.]{.underline}"^62^
[What he admires about these men and the movement they represent is that
they embody "a force that situates them above other men," which accounts
for their "sovereignty."]{.underline} Yet, [he also esteems greatly
their thoroughgoing antagonism to law: "the fact that laws are broken is
only the most obvious sign of the transcendent, *heterogeneous* nature
of fascist action]{.underline}."^63^ Here, the parallels with Schmitt's
critique of bourgeois legal positivism are of course profound. Both
Schmitt and Bataille view the institution of law as the consummate
embodiment of the spirit of bourgeois rationalism. It symbolizes
everything they detest about the reigning social order: its prosaic
longing for security, its unrevolutionary nature, its abhorrence of
"transcendence," its anathematization of the vitality and intensity one
finds in the "exception" (Schmitt) or "transgression" (Bataille).
Moreover, for Bataille the system of law merits especially harsh
treatment insofar as it signifies a type consecration of the profane
order of things, as such, it stands as an impediment to contact with the
heterogeneous or the sacred. [Bataille concludes his endorsement of
fascist politics with the following encomium: "*Heterogeneous* fascist
action belongs to the entire set of higher forms. It makes an appeal to
sentiments traditionally defined as *exalted* and *noble* and tends to
constitute authority as an unconditional principle situated above any
utilitarian judgment.]{.underline}" As opposed to the bourgeois order of
life, which, with its utilitarianism and its legalism, merely sanctifies
"the prose of the world," fascism offers a new political aesthetic, the
return, as it were, of an *aesthetic politics*: a type of politics that
reintroduces the long lost elements of charismatic leadership (in
Bataille's terms, "sovereignty"), violence, and martial glory. It is,
moreover, a politics that facilitates a great emotional cathexis between
leaders and masses, a point which Bataille emphasizes repeatedly. For
one of fascism's great attributes is that it "clearly demonstrates what
can be expected from a timely recourse to reawakened affective forces"
-- forces capable of guaranteeing a measure of *collective solidarity*,
which have been banished from a society in which the division of labor
and rationalization reign supreme. In sum, fascism serves to reintroduce
a type of *ecstatic politics* into the forlorn and disenchanted
landscape of political modernity, a politics that aims at the creation
of a quasi-Nietzschean *ecstatic community*.

#### The sacrificial practices Bataille celebrates sustain existing power relations.

**Wolin, 2006** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at
the [City University of New
York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York) Graduate
Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German
Ideology"Constellations vol. 2 issue 3, pp. 397-428)

Yet, [in his celebratory discussions of sacrifice]{.underline}, potlach,
and so forth, [Bataille fundamentally misconstrues the historical and
contextual parameters of such ritual practices]{.underline}. One could
even go so far as to say that, in a certain measure, [Bataille's
understanding of these phenomena succumbs to a type of "primitivism": he
decontextualizes the cultural practices he analyzes in order the better
to incorporate them within his own theoretical agenda]{.underline} of
his own critique of modernity. Here, Bataille seeks nothing less than
"an anthropology that will itself provide a living -- and orgiastic --
myth to overturn, through its experience on a collective level, 'modern'
sterile bourgeois society."^51^ [Bataille chooses to view
sacrifice]{.underline} and gift-giving in the first instance
[as]{.underline} gratuitous, [non-utilitarian]{.underline}, or, as he
puts it, "having no ends beyond themselves" -- [but this is far from the
case]{.underline}. While he is correct in characterizing [such
practices]{.underline} as related to the production of wealth, they [are
very much oriented toward *the reproduction of existing relations of
power.*]{.underline} The act of human sacrifice as practiced among the
Aztecs redounds to the credit of the sacrificer(s): [it reinforces
existing relations of authority, viz., the authority of those who are
empowered to commission a sacrifice]{.underline} (in this case, the
priests and aristocracy). It provides those in authority with a
quasi-divine power to preside over life and death. In this sense, [it is
misleading to claim that sacrifice has no end beyond
itself.]{.underline}

### at bataille: energy is finite

#### Bataille is wrong - the world's supply of energy and resources is finite and is being consumed rapidly now, risking extinction.

**Tverberg, 07** (Gail E., fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society and
a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries, writes for Contingency
magazine and TheOilDrum.com, "Our world is finite: Is this a problem?"
Energy Bulletin/Our Finite World,
<http://www.energybulletin.net/node/29117>)

[We all know the world is **finite**. The number of atoms is
finite]{.underline}, and these atoms combine to form a finite number of
molecules. The mix of molecules may change over time, but in total, the
number of molecules is also finite.

We also know that [**growth** is central to our way of
life]{.underline}. Businesses are expected to grow. Every day new
businesses are formed and new products are developed. The world
population is also growing, so all this adds up to a huge utilization of
resources. [At some point, growth in resource utilization must collide
with the fact that the world is finite.]{.underline} We have grown up
thinking that the world is so large that limits will never be an issue.
But now, we are starting to bump up against limits. **Where are we
reaching earth's limits?** 1. Oil [Oil is a finite resource, since it is
no longer being formed]{.underline}. Oil production in a given area
tends to increase for a time, then begins to decline, as the available
oil is pumped out. Oil production in the United States has followed this
pattern (Figure 1), as has oil production in the North Sea (Figure 2).
This decline has taken place in spite of technology improvements. [There
is now serious concern that world oil production will begin to
decline]{.underline} ("peak"), just as it has in the United States and
the North Sea. I discussed this earlier in [Oil Quiz - Test Your
Knowledge ](http://gailtheactuary.wordpress.com/2007/03/16/oil-quiz-test-your-knowledge/).
A congressional committee was also concerned about this issue, and asked
the US Government Accountability Office to study it. The GAO's report,
titled [CRUDE OIL: Uncertainty about Future Supply Makes It Important to
Develop a Strategy for Addressing a Peak and Decline in Oil
Production](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07283.pdf) confirmed that this
is an important issue. Exactly how soon this decline will begin is not
certain, but [many
predict ](http://www.worldoil.com/Magazine/MAGAZINE_DETAIL.asp?ART_ID=3163&MONTH_YEAR=Apr-2007)that
the decline may begin within the next few years. 2. Natural Gas\
[Natural
gas](http://www.aspo-usa.com/fall2006/presentations/pdf/Hughes_D_NatGas_Boston_2006.pdf) in
North America is also reaching its limits. United States natural gas
production reached its peak in 1973. Each year, more and more wells are
drilled, but the average amount of gas produced per well declines. This
occurs because the best sites were developed first, and the later sites
are more marginal. The United States has been importing more and more
natural gas from Canada, but this is also reaching its limits. Because
of these issues, the total amount of natural gas available to the United
States is likely to decline in the next few years - quite possibly
leading to shortages. 3. [Fresh Water Fresh water is needed for drinking
and irrigation, but here too we are reaching limits. Water from melting
ice caps is declining in quantity because of global
warming]{.underline}. Water is being pumped from aquifers much faster
than it is being replaced, and water tables are dropping by one to three
meters a year in many areas. Some rivers, especially in China and
Australia, are close to dry because of diversion for agriculture and a
warming climate. In the United States, water limitations are especially
important in the Southwest and in the more arid part of the Plains
States. 4. Top soil [The topsoil we depend on for agriculture is created
very slowly - about one inch in 300 to 500 years]{.underline}, depending
on the location. [The extensive tilling of the earth's soil that is now
being done results in many stresses on this topsoil, including erosion,
loss of organic matter, and chemical degradation. Frequent irrigation
often results in salination]{.underline}, as well. As society tries to
feed more and more people, and produce biofuel as well, there is
pressure to push soil to its limits--use land in areas subject to
erosion; use more and more fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides; and
remove the organic material needed to build up the soil. **Are there
indirect impacts as well?** Besides depleting oil, natural gas, fresh
water, and top soil, [the intensive use of the earth's resources is
resulting in **pollution** of air and water, and appears to be
contributing to **global warming** as well. **Can technology overcome
these finite world issues?** While we have been trying to develop
solutions, success has been limited to date. When we have tried to find
substitutes, we have mostly managed to trade one problem for
another:]{.underline}

### at bataille: expenditurn without reserve 🡪 extinction

#### Excessive consumption will cause extinction -- it's already at an unsustainable level.

**Trainer, 07** (Ted Trainer, Senior Lecturer in the School of Social
Work at the University of New South Wales. "Renewable Energy Cannot
Sustain a Consumer Society" p. 128-29)

[It is of the utmost importance to recognize that whether or not
renewable energy can sustain consumer-capitalist society is not a matter
of whether it can meet present energy demand. The essential question is
whether it can enable constant increase int he volume of goods and
services being consumed]{.underline} and the associated increase in
energy demand. [Energy demand is rising significantly]{.underline},
although estimates of future demand vary. ABARE's *Energy Outlook
2000*shows that the average annual rate of growth in energy use in
Australia over the decade of the 1990s was around 2.5% p. a. The
*Australian Yearbook* shows that between 1982 and 1998 Australian energy
use increased 50%, an arithmetical average growth rate of 3.13% p.a.,
and the rate has been faster in more recent years. (Graph 5.12.) However
ABARE estimates that Australian energy demand will slow, reaching about
1.9% p.a. by 2040, meaning more than a doubling in annual use by then.
In July 2003 Australian electricity authorities warned that blackouts
are likely in coming years due to the rapid rate of increase in demand,
estimated at almost 3% pa for the next five years. (ABC News, 31 July.)
Robbins (2003) reports NEMMCO predicting electricity growth over the
next 10 years in NSW, Queensland and Victoria as 3.1%, 3.5% and 2.6%
p.a. respectively. Poldy (2005) shows that over the past 100 years
Australian energy consumption has followed GDP growth closely, and he
estimates that in recent years it has approximated a growth rate of 3.6%
p.a. In 2004 world energy use jumped, growing at 4.3% p.a. (Catan,
2005.) [Thus the commitment to growth greatly exacerbates the problem,
and in turn all of the other resource supply problems, because all
involve an energy component.]{.underline} For instance if the cost of
fuel increases significantly, then so will the cost of food and
minerals, and even university courses, because fuel is needed to produce
them. It has been argued above that [renewables are not likely to be
capable of meeting present electricity and liquid fuel demand, but given
the inertia built into growth trends, the demand to be met will probably
be three or four times as big as it is now by mid
century]{.underline}\...and doubling every approximately 35 years
thereafter. To summarise regarding Fault 1, [consumer-capitalist society
is obviously grossly unsustainable.]{.underline} [We have far overshot
levels of production, consumption, resource use and affluence that are
sustainable for ourselves over a long period of time, let alone extended
to all the world's people.]{.underline} Yet our top priority is to
increase them continuously, without limit. [This is the basic cause of
the many alarming sustainability problems now threatening our
survival.]{.underline}

### at bataille: Ivory tower

#### The critique is ivory tower elitism -- only the rich and powerful can afford to expend without reserve. 

**Wolin, PhD, 04**

(Richard, *Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology* in
[The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from
Nietzsche to Postmodernism]{.underline} )

One could raise an analogous criticism of Bataille\'s treatment of
potlatch---the public, demonstrative destruction of wealth---as well
\[end page 170\] as gift-giving. In truth, **[only those who possess
great wealth can afford to destroy it. Consequently, the option to
engage in potlatch does not exist for society\'s lower
classes]{.underline}**. 56 **[Like sacrifice, potlatch is implicated in
the reproduction of social hierarchy. Such acts reinforce the status and
prestige of those who destroy their wealth. In nearly every case, the
practitioners of potlatch belong to the upper strata of society. Those
who are forced to passively endure the potlatch are in effect
humiliated. Through such acts, their lowly social rank is
reaffirmed]{.underline}**.(170-1)

### at bataille: sacrifice bad

#### Voting AFF does nothing to solve their impact 

Paul **Mann 99**, Literature prof @ Pomona, **1999**, Masocriticism, p.
67-69

I would like at one and the same time to affirm this model and to
dismiss it as the most desperate alibi of all. For "[sacrificial
consumption" **can never become an explicit critical
motive**]{.underline}.13 [At the moment it presents itself as a proper
element of some critical method, it degenerates into
**another**]{.underline} useful trope, another **[bit of intellectual
currency]{.underline}**, [**another paper-thin abyss, another proxy
transgression;** and the force of transgression moves elsewhere,
**beneath a blinder spot in the critical eye**]{.underline}.'4 Questions
of motive or understanding, [the fact that one might be self-critical
or]{.underline} at least [aware]{.underline} of recuperation, [are
immaterial]{.underline}: [what is at stake here is]{.underline} not
self-consciousness but [economics]{.underline}, material relations of
appropriation and exclusion, assimilation and positive loss. [Whatever
transgression occurs in]{.underline} writing on [Bataille does so only
through the stupid recuperation and hence evacuation of the
whole]{.underline} rhetoric and dream of [transgression]{.underline},
only insofar as the false profundity of philosophy or theory evacuates
the false profundities it apes. [To justify this]{.underline} as the
sublime loss of loss [is merely to indulge a paradoxical figure.
**Excess is not a project but a by-product of any
discourse**]{.underline}; [the interest of Bataillean discourse lies
chiefly in the compulsive and symptomatic way it **plays with its
feces**]{.underline}. [The spectacle of **critics making fools of
themselves** does not reveal the sovereign truth of death]{.underline}:
[it is only masocritical humiliation, a pathological attempt to disavow
the specter of death]{.underline}. As for the present essay, it makes no
claims to any redeeming sacrifice. Far from presenting you with a truer
Bataille, far from speaking in his voice more clearly than his other
readers, this essay pleads guilty to the indictment against every
appropriation. [Until philosophy and theory squeal like a pig before
Bataille's work]{.underline}, as he claims to have done before Dali's
canvases, [there will be no knowledge of Bataille]{.underline}. In the
end, one might have to take an even stricter view: [there is no
discourse of transgression]{.underline}, either on or [by Bataille.
**None at all**]{.underline}. It would be necessary to write a
'Postscript to Transgression" were it not for the fact that Foucault
already wrote it in his 'Preface," were it not for the fact that
Bataille himself wrote it the moment before he first picked up his pen.
[It makes no difference whether one]{.underline} betrays Bataille,
because one is hip to heterology or does it by accident, whether one
[lip syncs Bataille's rhetoric or drones on in the most tedious
exposition.]{.underline} All of these satellite texts are not
heliotropic in relation to the solar anus of Bataille's writing, or the
executioners he hoped (really?) would meet him in the Bois de Boulogne,
or dépensives in spite of themselves. It would be sentimental to assign
them such privileges. [They merely fail to fail. They are symptoms of a
discourse in which **everyone is happily transgressing everyone else and
nothing ever happens,** traces of a certain narcissistic pathos that
never achieves the magnificent loss Bataille]{.underline}'s text
[conveniently claims to desire, **and under whose cover it can continue
to account for itself,** hoarding its precious debits in a masocriticism
**that is anything but sovereign**]{.underline} **[and gloriously
indifferent]{.underline}**. [What is given to us]{.underline}, what is
ruinously and profitably exchanged, [is a lie]{.underline}. Heterology
gives the lie to meaning and discourse gives the lie to transgression,
in a potlatch that reveals both in their most essential and constitutive
relation. Nothing is gained by this communication except profit-taking
from lies. [We must indict Bataille as the alibi that allows all of this
writing to go on and on, pretending it is the nothing it is not, and
then turn away from Bataille as from a sun long since gone nova, in
order to witness the slow freezing to death of every
satellite]{.underline} text. The sacrificial consumption of [Bataille
has played itself out; the rotten carcass has been
consumed]{.underline}: no more alibis. What is at stake is no longer
ecstatic sexuality or violent upheavals or bloody sacrifices under the
unblinking eye of the sun; nor was it ever, from the very beginning of
Bataille's career. These are merely figures in the melodramatic theater
of what is after all a "soft expenditure" (Hollier 1989, xv), a much
more modest death, a death much closer to home. [It has never been more
than a question of the death of theory]{.underline} and of theory itself
as death. Of theory-death. A double fatality.

### at bataille: becoming wrong

#### Openness to flux and constant becoming destroys the foundations for political institutions necessary to sustain radical democratic life\-\--some universal, "fixed" guarantees of equality are crucial to politics 

Joseph **Schwartz 8**, Professor of Political Science at Temple
University, The Future of Democratic Equality, 56-61

Butler, Brown, and Connolly reject the essentialism of "narrow" identity
politics as an inverted "ressentiment" of the Enlightenment desire for a
universal, homogenized identity. They judge identity politics to be a
politics of "wounding, resentment, and victimization" that only can
yield bad-faith moralization Wendy Brown takes to task identity politics
for "essentializing" conceptions of group identity. For example, she
critiques the work of Catherine MacKinnon as epitomizing "identity"
political theory, accusing MacKinnon of denying women agency by
depicting them purely as victims.38 Brown also remains wary of the
patriarchal, conformist nature of traditional left conceptions of
solidarity and citizenship. Brown's implicit concept of radical
democratic citizenship rests upon the recognition that political
identity is continually in flux and is socially constituted through
"agonal" political struggle. Brown celebrates an Arendtian conception of
a polity in which both shared and particular identities are continually
open to reconstruction. In this "left Nietzschean" view of an
"everyperson's" will to power, there can be no cultural certainties or
political givens, as such "givens" would repress difference and
fluidity.39 But, [if the]{.underline} [human condition is]{.underline} a
world of [permanent flux, then we must postulate a human capability of
living with constant insecurity, for in this world there can be no
stable political institutions or political identitie]{.underline}s.40
[An ability to calculate the probabilities of political actions or
public policies would disappear in this world of infinite
liminality.]{.underline} [By assuming that the pre-eminent democratic
value is that of leaving all issues as permanently open to question,
post-structuralist "democratic theory" **eschews the theoretical and
political struggle over what established institutions**]{.underline} and
consensual values **[are needed to underpin a democratic
society]{.underline}**.¶ Post-structuralist analysis has contributed to
a healthy suspicion of narrow and "essentializing" identity politics.
But a self-identified feminist, African- American, or lesbian activist
is likely to value the shared historical narratives that partly
constitute such group identities. [Of course, if one is a democrat and a
pluralist, one would reject the oppressive homogenization
and]{.underline} potentially [authoritarian]{.underline} aspects of
ethnic or racial chauvinism and of "essentializing" types of identity
[politics]{.underline}. [The democratic political home should be open,
fluid, and self-reflective; but if]{.underline} [participation is to be
open]{.underline} to all, then such a [society]{.underline} also
[needs]{.underline} to reproduce [a shared democratic culture and the
institutional guarantee of democratic rights]{.underline}. That is,
contrary to post-structuralist analysis, [not all issues can be open to
"agonal struggle]{.underline}" in a democratic society. The traditional
radical democratic critique of democratic capitalism remains valid; [the
equal worth of the individual is devalued by rampant social inequality
within and between groups. Thus, a radical democrat, whether
post-structuralist or not, must not only be committed to institutional
protections of political and civil rights, but also to social
rights---the equal access to the basic goods of citizenship (education,
**health care**, housing, child care). Of course]{.underline}, the
precise nature and extent of these [rights will be politically contested
and constructed. But a democratic society cannot leave as totally "open"
the minimal institutional basis of democracy]{.underline}--- a
democratic society cannot be agnostic as to the value of freedom of
speech, association, and universal suffrage.¶ Social movements fighting
for an expansion of civil, political, and social rights, rarely, if
ever, rest their arguments on appeals to epistemological truths---
whether "foundational" or "anti-foundational." To remain democratic,
their policy goals cannot be so specific that they preclude political
argument about both their worth and how best to institutionalize them.
If social movements in a 58 democratic society deemed that every policy
defeat meant a betrayal of basic democratic principles, there would be
no give-and-take or winners and losers within democratic politics. But
if a government were to abolish freedom of speech and competitive
elections, or deny a social group basic rights, it would be reasonable
for an observer to judge that democratic principles had been violated.
[Democratic political movements]{.underline} and coalitions [struggle to
construct **shared meanings** about those political]{.underline}, civil,
and social [rights that should be guaranteed to all
citizens]{.underline}---and they often work to expand the types of
persons to be recognized as citizens (such as excluded immigrants).
**[Such arguments are inevitably grounded in normative arguments that go
beyond merely asserting the import of "flux,"
"difference,"]{.underline}** and "anti-essentialism." The civil rights
movement did not demand equal rights for all solely as an "agonal"
assertion of the will of the excluded; they desired to gain for persons
of color an established set of civil and political rights that had been
granted to some citizens and denied to others. The movement correctly
assumed that the exclusion of citizens from full political and civil
rights violated the basic norms of a democratic society. Thus,
[postmodern epistemological commitments to "flux" and "openness"
cannot]{.underline} in-and-of-themselves [sustain the "fixed" moral
positions needed to sustain a radical democracy.]{.underline}¶
Post-structuralist theorists openly proclaim their hostility to all
philosophical "meta-narratives." They reject comprehensive conceptions
of how society operates and the type of society that would best
instantiate human freedom. But [post-structuralists]{.underline} go
beyond rejecting "meta-narratives"; they insist that only an
"anti-foundational" epistemology can ground a politics of emancipation.
For Butler, Brown, and Connolly, not only do "meta-discourses"
invariably fail in their efforts to ground moral positions in a theory
of human nature or human reason. They also assert that an agonal
politics of democratic "we" formation can alone sustain democratic
society. This agonal [politics, they claim, can only be sustained by a
recognition of]{.underline} the inconstant signification of discourse
and [the ineluctable flux of]{.underline} personal and group
[identity]{.underline}.41 Rejecting the authoritarian, celebration of
the "ubermensch" by Nietzsche, they offer a post-Nietzschean, "amoral"
conception of democracy as an open-ended project of defining a self and
community that is constantly open to the desires of "others." These
theorists constantly reiterate the definitiveness (dare we say
"foundational truth") of this grounding of democracy, **[despite the
historical reality that social movements often contest dominant
narratives in the name of a stable alternative narrative of a democratic
and pluralist community.¶]{.underline}** One might well contend that the
[post-structuralist political stance is guilty of a new meta-narrative
of "bad faith," that of "anti-foundationalism."]{.underline} According
to this anti-foundational politics, a true democrat must reject any and
all a priori truths allegedly grounded upon the nature of human reason
or human nature. A committed democrat may well be skeptical of such
neo-Kantian or neo-Hegelian conceptions of freedom; but, many committed
democrats justify their moral commitments using these philosophical
methods. A democrat might also reject (or accept) the arguments of a
Jurgen Habermas or Hans Georg Gadamer that the structure of human
linguistic communication contains within it the potential for a society
based on reasoned argument rather than manipulation and domination. But
there are numerous other philosophically "pragmatic" ways to justify
democracy, even utilitarian ones. Political democrats may well disagree
about the best philosophical defense of democracy. But, invariably,
"practicing democrats" will defend the belief (however philosophically
"proved" or "justified") that democratic regimes best fulfill the moral
commitment to the equal worth of persons and to the equal potential of
human beings to freely develop and pursue their life plans.¶ To contend
that only an anti-foundationalist, anti-realist epistemology can sustain
democracy is to argue precisely for a foundational metaphysical
grounding for the democratic project. It is to contend that one's
epistemology determines one's politics. Hence, [Brown and
Butler]{.underline} both [spoke]{.underline} at a spring 1998 academic
conference at the University [of]{.underline} California at Santa Cruz
where some attributed "reactionary" and "left cultural conservatism" to
belief in "[reactionary" "foundationalist humanism]{.underline}."42
**[Post-structuralism cannot escape its own essentialist conception of
identity.]{.underline}** For example, [Butler]{.underline} contends in
Feminist Contentions that [democratic feminists must embrace the
post-structuralist "nondefinability of woman"]{.underline} as best
suited to open democratic constitution of what it is to be a "woman."43
[But this is itself a "closed" position and runs counter to the
practices of many democratic feminist activists who have tried to
develop a pluralist, yet collective identity around the shared
experiences of being a woman in a patriarchal society]{.underline} (of
course, realizing that working-class women and women of color experience
patriarchy in some ways that are distinct from the patriarchy
experienced by middle-class white women).¶ [One query that
post-structuralist theorists might ask themselves: **has there ever
existed a mass social movement that defined its primary "ethical" values
as being those of "instability and flux"?**]{.underline} Certainly many
sexual politics activists are cognizant of the fluid nature of sexuality
and sexual and gender identity. But only a small (disproportionately
university educated) segment of the women's and gay and lesbian movement
would subscribe to (or even be aware of) the core principles of
post-structuralist "anti-essentialist epistemology." Nor would they be
agnostic as to whether the state should protect their rights to express
their sexuality. [Post-structuralist theorists cannot avoid
justificatory arguments for why some identities should be considered
open and democratic and others exclusionary and
anti-democratic]{.underline}. That is, how could post-structuralist
political theorists argue that Nazi or Klan "ethics" are antithetical to
a democratic society---and that a democratic society can rightfully ban
certain forms of "agonal" (e.g. harassing forms of behavior against
minorities) struggle on the part of such anti-democratic groups.

#### The alt fails\-\--deriding all attempts at action as "freezing becoming" no way to deal with difficult political choices\-\--we also control terminal uniqueness because they can't convince [others]{.underline} to abandon liberal subjectivity 

Joseph **Schwartz 8**, Professor of Political Science at Temple
University, The Future of Democratic Equality, 56-62

A [politics of radical democratic pluralism cannot be securely grounded
by a]{.underline} whole-hearted [epistemological critique of
"enlightenment rationality." For implicit to any radical democratic
project is a belief in the equal moral worth of persons; to embrace such
a position renders one at least a "critical defender" of enlightenment
values of equality and justice, even if one rejects "enlightenment
metaphysics]{.underline}" and believes that such values are often
embraced by non-Western cultures. Of course, **[democratic norms are
developed by political practice and]{.underline}** 60 **[struggle rather
than by abstract philosophical argument]{.underline}**. But this is a
sociological and historical reality rather than a trumping philosophical
proof. [Liberal democratic publics rarely ground their politics in
coherent ontologies and epistemologies; and even among trained
philosophers there is no necessary connection between one's metaphysics
and one's politics.]{.underline} There have, are, and will be Kantian
conservatives (Nozick), liberals (Rawls), and radicals (Joshua Cohen;
Susan Okin); teleologists, left, center, and right (Michael Sandel,
Alasdair McIntyre, or Leo Strauss); anti-universalist feminists (Judith
Butler, Wendy Brown) and quasi-universalist, Habermasian feminists
(Seyla Benhabib, Nancy Fraser).¶ Post-structuralists try to read off
from an epistemology or ontology a politics; such attempts simply
replace enlightenment meta-narratives with postmodern (allegedly anti)
meta-narratives. Such efforts represent an idealist version of the
materialist effort---which post-structuralists explicitly condemn---to
read social consciousness off of the structural position of "the agent."
[A democratic political theory must offer both a]{.underline} theory of
[social structure and]{.underline} of the [social agents capable of
building such a society]{.underline}. In exchanging the gods of Weber
and Marx for Nietzsche and Heidegger (or their epigones Foucault and
Derrida), [poststructuralist theory has abandoned the institutional
analysis]{.underline} of social theory [for the **idealism** of abstract
philosophy.]{.underline} ¶ Connolly, Brown, and Butler reject explicit
moral deliberation as a bad faith Nietzschean attempt at "ressentiment."
Instead, they celebrate the amoral, yet ethical strivings of a
Machiavellian or Gramscian realist "war of position."44 Sheldon Wolin,
however, has written convincingly of how Machiavelli can be read as an
ethical realist, a theorist of moral utilitarianism.45 Even a
Machiavellian or Gramscian political "realist" must depend upon moral
argument to justify the social utility of hard political choices. That
is, if one reads both as ethical utilitarians who believe that, at
times, one must "dirty" one's hands in order to act ethically in
politics, then they embrace a utilitarian, "just war" theory of ethical
choice. According to this consequentialist moral logic, "bad means" are
only justifiable if they are the only, unavoidable way to achieve a
greater ethical good---and if the use of such "bad means" are absolutely
minimized. Such "**[hard" political choices yield social policies and
political outcomes that fix identities as well as transform
them]{.underline}**.¶ Not only in regard to epistemological questions
has post-structuralist theory created a new political "metaphysics"
which misconstrues the nature of democratic political practice; [the
post-structuralist analysis of]{.underline} "the death of man" and "[the
death of the subject"]{.underline} also **[radically preclude meaningful
political agency]{.underline}**. As with Michel Foucault, Butler
conceives of "subjects" as "produced" by powerknowledge discourses. In
Butler's view, the modernist concept of an autonomous subject is a
"fictive construct"; and [the very act of adhering to a belief in
autonomous human choice is to engage in "exclusion and differentiations,
perhaps a repression,]{.underline} that is subsequently concealed,
covered over, by the effect of autonomy."46 That is, the power of
discourse, of language and the unconscious, "produces subjects." [If
those "subjects" conceive of themselves as having the capacity for
conscious choice, they are guilty of "repressing" the manner in which
their own "subjectivity" is itself produced by discursive]{.underline}
61 exclusion: "if we agree that politics and a power exist already at
the level at which the subject and its agency are articulated and made
possible, then agency can be presumed only at the cost of refusing to
inquire into its construction."47 Susan Bickford pithily summarizes the
post-structuralist rejection of the modernist subject: "power is not
wielded by autonomous subjects; rather through power, subjectivity is
crafted."48 Bickford grants that post-structuralism provides some
insight into how group and individual identity is "culturally
constructed." But Bickford goes on to contend that [after
post-structuralism exposes the "lie of the natural" (that there are no
natural human identities), "socially constructed" modern **individuals
still wish to act in consort with others and to use human communication
to influence others: "people generally understand themselves as
culturally constituted and capable of agency**."]{.underline}49¶ [For if
there is no "doer behind the deed]{.underline}," but only "performative"
acts that constitute the subject, [how can the theorist]{.underline} (or
activist) [assign agency or moral responsibility to actors who are
"constituted by discursive practices]{.underline}." ("Discursive
practices" engaged in by whom, the observer may ask?) Butler insists
that not only is the subject "socially constituted" by power/knowledge
discourses, but so too is the "ontologically reflexive self" of the
enlightenment. Now if this claim is simply that all social critics are
socially-situated, then this view of agency is no more radical a claim
than that made by Michael Walzer in his conception of the social critic
(or agent). Walzer argues that even the most radical dissident must rely
upon the critical resources embedded within his own culture (often in
the almost-hidden interstices of that culture). Effective critical
agency cannot depend on some abstract universal, external logic.50
[Asserting that critical capacities are themselves socially constructed
provides the reader with no means by which to judge whether forms of
"resistance" are democratic and which are not.]{.underline} That is, [no
matter how hard one tries to substitute an aesthetic]{.underline},
"ironic," "amoral [ethical sensibility]{.underline}" for morality,
**[the]{.underline}** social critic and **[political activist cannot
escape engaging in moral argument and justification with fellow
citizens]{.underline}**.¶ Butler astutely notes that "resistance" often
mirrors the very powerknowledge discourses it rejects---resisting
hegemonic norms without offering alternative conceptions of a common
political life. But Butler seems to affirm the possibility (by whom?) of
effective rejection of such "norming" by "performative resignification."
But [the "resignification" of "performative" discursive constructions
provides no criteria by which to judge whether a given "resignification"
is emancipatory or repressive]{.underline}.51 And just who (if not a
relatively coherent, choosing human subject) is "performing" the
resignification. Furthermore, [if all forms of identity and social
meaning are predicated upon "exclusion," then the democratic theorist
needs to distinguish among those identities which "exclude" in a
democratic way and those which exclude in an anti-humanist, racist, and
sexist manner.]{.underline} [Some social "identities" are democratic and
pluralist, such as those created by voluntary affiliations. But other
"identities," such as structural, involuntary class differences and
racial and sexual hierarchies, must be transformed, even eliminated, if
democracy is to be furthered]{.underline}. And how we behave---or
"perform"---can subvert (or reinforce) such undemocratic social
structures. But if these social structures are immutably inscribed by62
"performative practices," then there can be no democratic resistance. In
her call for an ironic politics of "performative resistance," Butler
seems to imply that human beings have the capacity to choose which
"performative practices" to engage in---and from which to abstain. If
this is the case, then a modernist conception of agency and moral
responsibility has covertly snuck its way back into Butler's political
strategy.52

#### Institutional distributions of power like weed prohibition result in obliterations of difference\-\--accepting some commonality for the sake of contingent political claims is not a violent imposition of being\-\--it's necessary for political movement building 

Joseph **Schwartz 8**, Professor of Political Science at Temple
University, The Future of Democratic Equality, 73-74

As I argued in the prior chapter, [post-structuralists fail to offer any
coherent political strategy for emancipation beyond individuals
"performatively" "resisting" dominant norms]{.underline}.
Post-structuralists are correct to worry that social movements can
define "authentic" norms and behavior in ways that become overly
restrictive and conformist; such non-pluralist movements can end up
"norming" and "disciplining" their members. Feminists, queer theorists,
and critical race theorists have critiqued the anti-political,
homogenizing constraints of essentialist forms of identity politics.1
But [while]{.underline} democratic [pluralists should warn against
homogenizing group pressures, they should not ignore the reality that
the building of social movements involves the **construction of shared
narratives and common identities**]{.underline}.2

While theorists of a "politics of difference" are more attentive to the
social constitution and activities of social groups, as with
[post-structuralists]{.underline}, they sometimes [fail to recognize
that "difference" is frequently **institutionalized** upon a terrain of
unequal power and resources]{.underline}. [This oversight mirrors the
failure of]{.underline} earlier [liberal]{.underline} pluralist
[conceptions of politics]{.underline} to illuminate how the structural
nature of power in capitalist democracies leads some groups to have much
greater power than their numbers (or lack thereof) would democratically
justify. Foucault's [concern with "micro-power]{.underline}"---and his
conscious downplaying of the import of macro-structural social
forces---[renders most]{.underline} post-structuralist influenced
[theory silent in regard to the reconfiguration and accentuation of
structural inequality]{.underline} integral to late capitalism (not only
in regard to class, but also in regard to the material and cultural
inequalities of race, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation). One
can see how the complex interaction of inequalities of race, class, and
gender influences United States politics. The insidious "raced and
gendered" nature of economic inequality in the United States has been
ideologically mobilized by the right to create sharp political divisions
between the "old" industrial (and deindustrialized), predominantly
white, male working class and the expanding (predominantly female,
immigrant, and persons of color) "precariot" of the underemployed and
unemployed.

Thus, a "politics of difference" has not created a political majority
capable of transforming the material and social conditions of poor
communities of color or of working class and poor women (and men) of all
races. The popular (and corporate) celebration of "diversity" has
consciously failed to interrogate the relationship between inequality
and "diversity." [Group assertion of "difference" can be empowering; but
it can also be oppressive to those who are "othered" by dominant groups.
Inner-city African-Americans have been "othered" by mainstream American
society]{.underline}; [and the vicious materiality of that "othering"
has led most]{.underline} [middle- and upper-]{.underline}working[-class
suburbanites]{.underline} (and not just whites) [to fail to recognize
inner-city residents as fellow citizens who merit a **radical
transformation of public policy aimed at achieving substantive equal
opportunity for all citizens**]{.underline}.

### at bataille: war thesis avoidable

#### Studying war analytically helps avoid it.

**Edelstein 10** -- (2010, David, PhD in Political Science, Associate
Professor in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and the
Department of Government at Georgetown University, "Why realists don't
go for bombs and bullets,"
http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/07/21/why-realists-dont-go-for-bombs-and-bullets/)

Thanks to Steve Walt for inviting me to contribute to his blog while he
is away on vacation. I have been a regular reader of Steve's blog since
it launched, and for my first post, I wanted to pick up on a motif that
I have seen running through Steve's posts: [Will realists
ever]{.underline} again [support]{.underline} the use of [military
force]{.underline} by the United States[?]{.underline}

Followers of this blog will by now have little doubt about how Walt felt
about the Iraq War or how he views the prospects for U.S. success in
Afghanistan. In fact, throughout the history of his blog, I can only
recall one case in which Walt advocated the use of U.S. military force
(and I think the realist credentials in that case are rather dubious).

**[There is a common perception]{.underline}** in the field of political
science **[that realists are war-mongering Neanderthals]{.underline}**
anxious to use military force at the drop of a hat. Attend any meeting
(if you must) of the American Political Science Association or the
International Studies Association, and [one will find realists derided
as the \"bombs and bullets guys\"]{.underline} as if we were all direct
descendants of Curtis LeMay. [What is notable]{.underline} about this
--- and what has been notable about Steve's blog --- [is just how
**infrequently realists have supported the use of American military
force**]{.underline}. [Take]{.underline} the U.S. interventions of the
post-Cold War period: [Panama, the Gulf War, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq]{.underline}. [Of those interventions,
Afghanistan was the only one that received anything close to strong
support from most realists. Others,]{.underline} [most notably the Iraq
War, **received vehement opposition from the vast majority of
realists**]{.underline}. [Even in the case of Afghanistan, realists
expressed trepidation about the prospects for]{.underline} ultimate
[success]{.underline} despite early victories.

[Go back to the Cold War]{.underline}, [and realists like]{.underline}
Kenneth [Waltz and]{.underline} Hans [Morgenthau were famously opposed
to the U.S. intervention in Vietnam]{.underline}. [Lest one think this
is an academic phenomenon, realist policymakers like]{.underline} Brent
[Scowcroft were equally critical]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the Bush
administration's actions in [Iraq]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} George
F. [Kennan was skeptical of]{.underline} the U.S. interventions in [both
Korea and Vietnam]{.underline}. [Today, should anyone dare to suggest
the use of military force in new contexts such as Iran, they are
summarily dismissed by prominent realists]{.underline}. **[Not a
single]{.underline}** (self-proclaimed or attributed)
**[realist]{.underline}** I know of **[has advocated the use of military
force against Iran]{.underline}** in response to its apparent
development of nuclear weapons, and most are adamantly opposed to it.

From one perspective, this opposition is surprising. It is realists,
after all, who so value material power, in particular military
capabilities. It is not difficult to understand why so many would assume
that realists are anxious to use military force because realists are
anxious to focus on military capabilities as a primary explanatory
variable for international politics.

But **[it is precisely because realists have spent so much time studying
military force that they are also so reluctant to use military
force]{.underline}**. Though realists themselves are divided on the
question, [many have concluded that]{.underline} the use of military
[force is]{.underline} often [counterproductive]{.underline}, inviting
balancing coalitions that simply make life more difficult. Moreover, as
I have argued elsewhere, using military force to reorder societies is
very difficult and unlikely to succeed except in uncommon circumstances.

#### Treating death as asthetics causes mass death 

**Minkoff,** 4/25/**'7** (C. Michael, GA Tech,
http://smartech.gatech.edu/dspace/bitstream/1853/14446/8/Michael%20Minkoff\--LCC%204100\--Animal_Sacrifice.pdf)

What Nancy admits is that "strictly speaking we know nothing decisive
about the old sacrifice" and that "the Western economy of sacrifice has
come to a close...it is closed by the decomposition of the sacrificial
apparatus itself" (Nancy, 35). These confessions are significant because
it indicates the fear that Nancy has of appropriating a symbol which has
a remainder and a vector he cannot predict or control. **[What Bataille
wanted from sacrifice was one thing, but]{.underline}** Nancy fears that
**[sacrifice carries its own valence. It is like the art that accedes to
extinction,]{.underline}** but suspends above it indefinitely. [The
force to accede to extinction is not guaranteed to suspend.]{.underline}
**[The force that Bataille borrows from sacrifice is not guaranteed to
behave in the way atheism dictates]{.underline}**. Nancy reasserts that
Western sacrifice always knew it sacrificed to nothing, but this latent
knowledge makes the institution of sacrifice absurd, and Nancy is not
willing to deny that sacrifice "sustained and gave meaning to billions
of individual and collective existences" (Nancy, 35) What Nancy fears is
this ignorance. He knows he does not understand the significance of the
old sacrifice. If sacrifice was to no one and everyone knew it; why was
and is it so universal and why have so many been tempted into believing
its significance? But [**if one assumes that there is no one to whom one
sacrifices, Bataille may not use sacrifice as the centerpiece of his
philosophy because** if sacrifice is not to anyone, it is not truly
significant**.**]{.underline} If it is not significant or meaningful, it
has no power. It becomes comedic. **[And it becomes
massacre.]{.underline}** **[That is why Nancy spends much of his time
talking about the sacrifice of the Jews at Auschwitz.]{.underline}**
Without over-determining the significance, the sacrifice becomes a
genocide or a holocaust. **[Bataille is trapped]{.underline}** between
two uncomfortable positions---**[let the blood continue to spill to make
sacrifice real]{.underline}** and significant and concrete, **[or deny
the death the status of sacrifice, which]{.underline}** in Bataille's
mind, **[would be to deny it realization.]{.underline}** Nancy asks if
Bataille's "dialectical negativity expunges blood or whether, on the
contrary, blood must ineluctably continue to spurt" (Nancy, 27). If
Bataille spiritualizes sacrifice, it no longer has the power of real
death, the concreteness of finiteness and the ability to rupture
finitude. But if Bataille insists on the real death, he necessitates the
constant spilling of blood in mimetic repetition until history is
completed in the Sage

#### Death means they can't love war.

**Hagglund 8**

(Martin, Radical Atheism: Derrida and the Time of Life, pg. 203-4)

The first consequence of a radically atheist thinking of politics, then,
is that it gives access to a hyperpolitical logic that spells out that
nothing is unscathed or unquestionable. The second consequence is that
the logic of radical atheism transforms the most fundamental assumptions
about what is desirable. Political philosophy has traditionally
determined corruption as an evil that supervenes on something that
precedes it or as a lamentable fact of life that ought to be overcome in
an ideal future. In contrast Derrida maintains that the essential
corruptability of autoimmunity is not a privation but the condition for
even the highest good or the most ideal justice. In his formulation,
"the possibility of evil, or of perjury, must be intrinsic to the good
or to justice for either to be possible.t'" As I have argued, this logic
follows from a radically atheist conception of desire, where [justice
and the good are essentially matters of mortal survival]{.underline}.
[Mortal survival opens the chance for everything that is desired and the
threat of everything that is feared, since without mortal survival there
can be nothing at all]{.underline}. **[Mortal survival is thus a
necessary but not sufficient requirement for justice and
goodness]{.underline}**. [The affirmation of survival is the condition
for any ability to respond to suffering, but this does not mean that the
affirmation of survival is simply in the service of life]{.underline}.
[It is rather the source of all passion for life and the source of all
resentrnent for life]{.underline}. **[Without the affirmation of
survival there would be no compassion and love]{.underline}** (since one
would not be committed to anything), **[but there would also be no
suffering and hate]{.underline}** (since one would not be threatened by
anything).

#### Instead, change the concrete conditions that cause us to "love" war.

**[Stuhr]{.underline}**, professor of philosophy -- Emory,
**['8]{.underline}**

(John J, "A Terrible Love of Hope," *Journal of Speculative Philosophy*
22(4), pg. 278-289)

**[If Hillman is right, he is only partly right]{.underline}**. [We may
have a terrible love of war. But we]{.underline} can and [do have other
loves as well]{.underline}. It is not my only love, but I confess to an
unshakable, terrible love of hope, and peace too. Because I do not share
Hillman\'s \[End Page 283\] Jungian psychological commitments, I am not
sure that this love is archetypal or universal. Maybe Paul Simon is
right that \" everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance,\"
that \"the thought that life could be better is woven indelibly into our
hearts and our brains.\"10 Or maybe only some people love this sound,
and maybe this thought is woven only precariously into some hearts and
bones sometimes. But I am sure that this [love of hope and peace has a
history and expression equal in duration and depth to those of love of
war]{.underline}. I am sure that for every General Patton, quoted by
Hillman, who proclaims love of war beyond love of life, there is a
General MacArthur, who proclaimed just as strongly, \"I have seen war. .
. . I hate war.\" Or there is a General (and President) Eisenhower, who
observed in 1953 that war \"is not a way of life at all in any true
sense\" but only \"humanity hanging on a cross of iron.\" Or there is a
General Sherman, who said that \"war is hell.\" Or there is a Senator
John McCain, who said: \"War is wretched beyond description, and only a
fool or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel reality.\" And then what,
**[now what?]{.underline}** What should a meliorist do? Terrible lovers
of hope and peace often have answered this question in one or both of
two ways. [The first is the way of individual
self-transformation]{.underline}. I think of this strategy as an
\"Inward Bound\" program. \"[War and peace start in the hearts of
individuals]{.underline},\" Pema [Chodron writes]{.underline}.11 The way
to peace is the way of turning hearts of war into hearts of peace and
nonviolence; hearts open to what Gandhi called the \"infinite
possibilities of universal love,\" universal truth, and the God within
us all; and hearts in community and communion with one another.12 All we
need is love---though, of course, that is a lot, and this way is
difficult. It requires that we reject as our ideal the strategic
warrior: War will exist, John F. Kennedy said, \"until that distant day
when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige
as the warrior does today.\" Whatever its merits---and I think there are
real merits---**[this approach has not proven very
effective]{.underline}**. [It has proven difficult for individuals to
embody and enact it.]{.underline} And [it has proven difficult for
individuals who do embody it to transform those who do not.]{.underline}
Perhaps most people need to try a lot harder, or perhaps this approach
just demands too much of most people. In either case, this approach is
too individualistic and voluntaristic. It is not very useful to demand
that people act virtuously---peacefully, lovingly,
cooperatively---without attending to the cultural conditions that would
enable them significantly to do so. If one takes the self less as
archetypal and more as cultural---as, for example, the irreducibly
social self explained by George Herbert Mead---then so too one must see
the self\'s vices and virtues, including loves and hopes, as social. It
is some version of this insight that underlies [a second approach to
peace]{.underline} by those with a terrible love of hope: [the way of
societal transformation]{.underline}. I think of this strategy as an
\"Outward Bound\" program. On this view, war and peace start in cultural
conditions. The way to peace is the way of social action: the
amelioration of oppression, domination, abuse, threats, humiliation,
poverty, hunger, illness, \[End Page 284\] ignorance, and
miscommunication. All we need is social change---though, of course, that
is a lot, and this way is difficult, piecemeal, and never complete.
Whatever its merits---and, again, I think there are real and great
merits---[this approach has not proven very effective. It has been
difficult to]{.underline} greatly [reduce]{.underline}, much less
eliminate[, social conditions that nurture and sustain war]{.underline}.
And it has proven difficult to spread or export even partial, local,
temporary success. This is not surprising; those conditions are in part
nurtured by our love of war. Perhaps more work is needed, or perhaps the
problems are just too great in light of this love of war. [If concrete
cases of love of hope and peace point toward, and result from, both self
and societal transformation, so too do concrete cases of love of
war]{.underline}. We may discipline ourselves to become more loving or
more hateful. We may engage in social action to foster harmony or
conflict. [Recognizing this fact, we should not only strive to eliminate
love of war through inward-bound self-transformation or outward-bound
societal reconstruction]{.underline}. [Hillman argues]{.underline} [that
this is impossible]{.underline}, and whether it is necessarily
impossible, as he says, or just contingently impossible, neither of
these strategies has worked so far. [Instead, we should focus on
changing the conditions that call forth action on behalf of love of
war---**and thereby change the consequences of love of
war**]{.underline}. In other words, [if a healthy dose of realism
suggests that we cannot eliminate love of war, then a healthy dose of
meliorism suggests that we need to work to (1) reduce]{.underline}---not
eliminate, but reduce---[its manifestations or outbreaks and (2)
redirect its energy]{.underline}. Let me expand on these two points. In
the first place, then, we need to focus on the signs in our experience
that love of war is moving us toward acts of war. What are these signs?
They include at least the following six features of experience: \* mdash
a morality of fundamentalist dualisms and absolutes: experiences of
sharply separate and complete goods and complete evils, of self and
radical other, of us and them, of good guys in a shining city on the
hill and white hats and evil empires, of our benevolence and their
arrogance and humiliation of us, of the outwardly same actions by us as
justified and by them as unjust \* mdash a unique temporality:
experiences that things are different or unique or special now, that a
final moment has been entered and that we are tested by it, that we must
respond right now fully and finally, that their actions must not be
allowed to pass, that we have come to a turning point, that there is no
going back, that it is now or never and that the past has come to an end
\* mdash an exceptional metaphysics: experiences that God and history
are with us; that we are chosen or exceptional or highest; that we are
more than just another group striving to respond to our problems and
advance our interests; that our interests, above all others, are Real or
True or Holy \* mdash a projected transformation: experiences of
anticipation and expectation that everything that really matters will be
different---depending on what we do \[End Page 285\] now; that we stand
at a threshold of possible irreversible triumph, glory, and salvation;
that a qualitatively different future is about to dawn \* mdash a
single-mindedness: experiences of narrowed focus and realization,
finally, of what alone matters; of everything else as secondary and
unimportant; of this alone as one\'s calling and meaning of life; of

mdash the impossibility of communication: experiences that we cannot
talk with them, that our truths permanently cut us off from their lies,
that we can understand them but that they cannot understand us, that
without our direct experience and our identity outsiders can never
understand us, that deliberation and understanding are impossible and
pointless and even demeaning13 These and related [experiences, rooted in
a love of war, are **not merely \"natural**]{.underline}.\" Instead,
[they]{.underline} can be, and [are]{.underline}, [manufactured and
manipulated and deployed]{.underline}. Today we have learned that
Hermann Göring was right that it is easy for leaders to drag the people
to war: \"All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country
to danger. It works the same in any country.\" Accordingly, those who
hope for peace must invent democratic practices and institutions that
mediate, intervene, and educate for different, fundamentally opposite
experiences and policies. The politics of any effective love and hope
for peace must be, in the broadest sense of the term, educational. The
love of war, William James notes, is a love of meaningful and strenuous
service to, and pride in, a collectivity. Noting that \"no collectivity
is like an army for nourishing such pride,\" James nonetheless
melioristically maintains that \"the martial type of character can be
bred without war.\"14 How? James says in response that \"a permanently
successful peace-economy cannot be a simple pleasure-economy\" and that,
instead, \"[new energies and hardihoods must transform \"the manliness
to which the military mind so faithfully clings.]{.underline}\" He
continues: \"[The war-function has graspt us so far; but constructive
interests may some day seem no less imperative and impose on the
individual a hardly lighter]{.underline} burden.\"15 What constructive
interests? James focuses on lives of little or nothing else but
suffering imposed by accidents of birth, position, and opportunity---a
general stance that dovetails nicely with many contemporary concerns
about class and economic colonialism, nation and hemisphere, race and
ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation, disability and disease, human
rights and environmental justice. **[The advance of these interests is
not primarily a matter of individual will.]{.underline}** Even James,
often incorrectly supposed to be focused exclusively on individuality
and personal energies, realizes that this task is social and
educational. He proposes, instead of military conscription, \"a
conscription of the whole youthful population\" to battle the injustices
of birth, to even them out, and to provide other benefits to the
commonwealth.16 There may be no reason, then or today, to limit this
conscription to the \"youthful population,\" though there is good reason
to think that its educational \[End Page 286\] impact there would be
greatest. There is every reason, by contrast, to think that love of
peace, [when not joined by imaginative action to create new social
institutions and practices of this type, fails to be genuine hope for
peace---and becomes merely an idle wish for]{.underline} peace.
Moreover, I confess that it is difficult for me to see how any
philosophy that is not linked to this sort of cultural reconstruction is
anything like real love of wisdom---philosophy as a personal way of
life---as distinct from love of some texts, authors, or what James, in
sexist language of the day, calls \"unmanly ease\"---philosophy as a
professional way of earning a living. James says that genuine hope for
peace and creation of its alternative, constructive interests may some
day seem imperative. A century later, that day has not come. Yet.
[Hopeful opposition to war requires the ongoing creation and
reconstruction of positive alternatives to the perceptions that turn
love of war into acts of war. It requires creation of different enemies,
weapons, and campaigns to supply the satisfactions of that love.
Effective opposition to war can be nothing less]{.underline}.

**psych doesn't explain war**

**Hoffman,** Center for European Studies at Harvard, **1986** \[Stanley,
"On the Political Psychology of Peace and War: A Critique and an
Agenda," *Political Psychology* 7.1, jstor, p. 7-11\]

This is why I talked about a different reading of reality. [One group,
looking at the show, concludes that it is utopian to wish it away, or to
sug- gest cures]{.underline} [whose adoption cannot be imagined unless
it were already fun- damentally different from what it is now and has
been for ages]{.underline}. [The other group, looking at the new weapons
on the stage,]{.underline} and remembering the show\'s past breakdowns,
[argues that the only way of preventing the fire next time is to move to
a totally new stage, and to change the play and the actors]{.underline}.

As I said already, [not all the traditionalists promise world peace, nor
do all the radicals believe in the mathematical certainty of nuclear war
and winter.]{.underline} But they are convinced that the very
impossibility of a mutation before disaster limits the scope and indeed
the types of measures that can realistically be taken to avoid it.
[Radical impatience with]{.underline} what is (wrongly) often inter-
preted as a professional commitment of [traditional
analysts]{.underline} to the perpetua- tion of the current state of
their field - as a failure on their part, as well as on the part of
statesmen, to be shaken, like lonesco\'s characters, by the sud- den
irruption of rhinoceroses in our midst - [is matched by traditionalist
an- noyance at what is often perceived as mere rhetoric of indignation,
denunciation, and exorcism, fist shaking at unwelcome facts, and unfair
name calling addressed to actors who, caught in a game they did not
invent, do,]{.underline} at best, [what they can to keep it from blowing
up and]{.underline}, more usually, [at least what they have been
selected for.]{.underline}

This brings us to a second difference. The radicals, who tend (often
correctly) to perceive the policy scientists\' stance as a trahison des
clercs, write and behave as if they were above the fray, seeing through
the ra- tionalizations statesmen endlessly provide, and the stereotypes
in which citizens cloak their fears, frustrations, and aggressions. At
the same time, they can\'t help but belong to different communities:
While calling for a global identity, they remain, say, Americans or
British, or Indian, or Israeli. Their recommendatations are usually
addressed to, or hurled at, their own governments or (in the case of
many intellectuals from less power- ful countries who deal with the
global cold war) at the superpowers. The underlying assumption, once
again, is that the seriousness of the peril should push their own
national government, or, in the latter case, the great powers\' leaders,
into adopting the drastic measures needed for salvation.

The [traditionalists, even when]{.underline}, in their own work, [they
try scrupulous-ly to transcend national prejudices and to seek
scientific truth, believe that]{.underline} **[it is unrealistic to
expect statesmen to stand above the fray]{.underline}**: By definition,
the statesmen are there to worry not only about planetary survival, but
--- first of all---about national survival and safety. To be sure, they
ought to be able to see how certain policies, aimed at enhancing
security, actually increase in-security all around. But there are sharp
limits to how far they can go in their mutual empathy or in their acts
(unlike intellectuals in their advice), as long as the states\'
antagonisms persist, as long as uncertainty about each other\'s
intentions prevails, and as long as there is reason to fear that one
side\'s wise restraint, or unilateral moves toward \"sanity,\" will be
met, not by the rival\'s similar restraint or moves, but either by swift
or skillful political or military exploitation of the opportunity
created for unilateral gain, or by a for-midable domestic backlash if
national self-restraint appears to result in ex-ternal losses,
humiliations or perceptions of weakness.

There is little point in saying that the state of affairs which imposes
such limits is \"anachronistic\" or \"unrational.\" To traditionalists,
[the radicals\' stance --- condemnation from the top of Mount Olympus
--- can only impede understanding of the limits and possibilities of
reform]{.underline}. To be sure, the fragmentation of mankind is a
formidable obstacle to the solution of many problems that cannot be
handled well in a national framework, and a deadly peril insofar as the
use of force, the very distinctive feature of world politics, now
entails the risk of nuclear war.

[But one can hardly call anachronistic a phenomenon---the assertion of
national identity --- that, to the bulk of]{.underline} \[HU\][mankind,
appears not only as a necessity but also as a positive
good]{.underline}, since humanity\'s fragmentation results from the very
aspiration to self-determination. Many people have only recently emerged
from foreign mastery, and have reason to fear that the alternative to
national self-mastery is not a world government of assured fairness and
efficiency, but alien domination.

As for \"unrationality,\" the drama lies in the contrast between the
ra-tionality of the whole, which scholars are concerned about---the
greatest good of the greatest number, in utilitarian terms --- and the
rationality or greatest good of the part, which is what statesmen worry
about and are responsible for. What the radicals denounce as irrational
and irresponsible from the viewpoint of mankind is what Weber called the
statesman\'s ethic of responsibility. [What keeps ordinary \"competitive
conflict processes]{.underline}\" (Deutsch, 1983)--- the very stuff of
society --- [from becoming \"unrational\" or destructive, is precisely
what the nature of world politics excludes: the restraint of the
partners either because of the ties of affection or responsibility that
mitigate the conflict, or because of the existence of an
outsider]{.underline} --- marriage counselor, arbitrator, judge,
policeman or legislator--- [capable of inducing or imposing
restraints.]{.underline}

Here we come to a third point of difference. [The very absence of such
safeguards of rationality]{.underline}, the obvious discrepancy between
what each part intends, and what it (and the whole world) ends with, the
crudeness of some of the psychological mechanisms at work in
international affairs---as one can see from the statements of leaders,
or from the media, or from inflamed publics---[have led many
radicals]{.underline}, especially among those whose training or
profession is in psychoanalysis or mental health, [to treat the age-old
contests of states in terms, not of the psychology of politics, but of
**individual psychology and pathology.**]{.underline}

There are two manifestations of this. One is the tendency to look at
nations or states as individuals writ large, stuck at an early stage of
development (similarly, John Mack (1985) in a recent paper talks of
political ideologies as carrying \"forward the dichotomized structures
of childhood\"). One of my predecessors writes about \"the
correspondence between development of the individual self and that of
the group or nation,\" and concludes \"that intergroup or international
conflict contains the basic elements of the conflict each individual
experiences psychologically\" (Volkan, 1985). Robert Holt, from the
viewpoint of cognitive psychology, finds \"the largest part of the
American public\" immature, in a \"phase of development below the
Conscientious\" (Holt, 1984). The second related aspect is the tendency
to look at the notions statesmen or publics have of \"the enemy,\" not
only as residues of childhood or adolescent phases of development, but
as images that express \"disavowed aspects of the self\" (Stein, 1985),
reveal truths about our own fears and hatreds, and amount to masks we
put on the \"enemy,\" because of our own psychological needs.

Here is where the clash between traditionalists and radicals is
strongest. Traditionalists do not accept a view of group life derived
from the study of individual development or family relations, or a view
of modern society derived from the simplistic Freudian model of
regressed followers identifying with a leader. They don\'t see in
ideologies just irra-tional constructs, but often rationally selected
maps allowing individuals to cope with reality. They don\'t see national
identification as pathological, as an appeal to the people\'s baser
instincts, more aggressive impulses or un-sophisticated mental defenses;
it is, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau so well understood, the competition of
sovereign states that frequently pushes people from \"sane\" patriotism
to \"insane\" nationalism (Rousseau\'s way of preventing the former from
veering into the latter was, to say the least, im-practical: to remain
poor in isolation). Nor do they see anything \"primitive\" in the
nation\'s concern for survival: It is a moral and structural
requirement.

Traditionalists also believe that [the \"intra-psychic\" approach
distorts reality]{.underline}. **[Enemies are not mere projections of
negative identities; they are often quite real.]{.underline}** To be
sure, the Nazis\' view of the Jews fits the metaphor of the mask put on
the enemy for one\'s own needs. But [were]{.underline}, in return,
[those Jews who understood what enemies they had in the Nazis, doing the
same?]{.underline} Is the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, is the
Soviet regime\'s treatment of dissidents, [was the Gulag merely a
convenient projection]{.underline} of our intrapsychic battles? Clichés
such as the one about how our enemy \"understands only force\" may tell
us a great deal about ourselves; but sometimes they contain half-truths
about him, and not just revelations about us. [Our fears flow not only
from our private fantasies but also from concrete realities and from the
fantasies which the international state of nature
generates.]{.underline}

In other words, [the psychology of politics which traditionalists deem
adequate is not derived from theories of psychic development and health;
it is derived from the logic of the international milieu]{.underline},
which breeds the kind of vocabulary found in the historians and
theorists of the state of nature: fear and power, pride and honor,
survival and security, self-interest and reputation, distrust and
misunderstanding, commitment and credibility. It is also derived from
the social psychology of small or large groups, which resorts to the
standard psychological vocabulary that describes mental mechanisms or
maneuvers and cognitive processes: denial, projection, guilt,
repression, closure, rigidity, etc\.... [But using this vocabulary does
not imply that a group whose style of politics is paranoid is therefore
composed of people who, as private individuals, are paranoid. Nor does
it relieve us of the duty to look at the objective reasons and functions
of these mental moves]{.underline}, and of the duty to make explicit our
assumptions about what constitutes a \"healthy,\" wise, or proper social
process.

Altogether, [traditionalists find the mental health approach to world
affairs unhelpful. Decisions about war and peace are usually taken by
small groups of people;]{.underline} [the temptation of analyzing their
behavior]{.underline} either, literal-ly, in terms of their
personalities, or, metaphysically[, in terms borrowed from the study of
human development, rather than]{.underline} in those of group dynamics
or [principles of international politics]{.underline} [is
understandable. But]{.underline} [it is misleading. What is pathological
in couples]{.underline}, or in a well-ordered community, [is, alas,
frequent, indeed normal, among states, or in a troubled state. What is
malignant or crazy is usually not the actors or the social process in
which they are engaged: it is the possible results.]{.underline}

The grammar of motives which the mental health approach brands as
primitive or immature is actually rational for the actors.
Traditionalists fear that [this particular approach leads to the
substitution of labels for explanations, to bad analysis and fanciful
prescriptions. Bad analysis]{.underline}: the tendency to see in group
coherence a regressive response to a threat, whereas it often is a
rational response to the \"existential\" threats entailed by the very
nature of the international milieu. Or [the tendency to see in
the]{.underline} effacement or minimization of individual differences in
[a group a release of unconscious instincts, rather than a phenomenon
that can be perfectly adaptive---in response to stress or
threats]{.underline}---or result from governmental manipulation or
originate in the code of conduct inculcated by the educational system,
etc.. . The habit of comparing the state, or modern society, with the
Church or the army, and [to analyze human relations in these
institutions in ways that stress the libidinal]{.underline} more than
the cognitive and superego [factors]{.underline}, or equate libidinal
bonds and the desire for a leader. [The view that enemies are above all
products of mental drives, rather than inevitable concomitants of social
strife at every level]{.underline}. Or the view that the contest with
the rival fulfills inter-nal needs, which may be true, but requires
careful examination of the nature of these needs (psychological?
bureaucratic? economic?), [obscures the objective reasons of the
contest, and risks confusing cause and function.]{.underline}

Indeed, [such analysis is particularly misleading in dealing with the
pre-sent scene]{.underline}. The radicals are so (justifiably) concerned
with the nuclear peril that the traditional ways in which statesmen and
publics behave seem to vindicate the pathological approach. But this, in
turn, incites radicals to overlook the fundamental ambiguity of
contemporary world politics. On the one hand, there is a nuclear
revolution---the capacity for total destruction. On the other hand, many
states, without nuclear weapons, find that the use of force remains
rational (in terms of a rationality of means) and beneficial at home or
abroad---ask the Vietnamese, or the Egyptians after October 1973, or
Mrs. Thatcher after the Falklands, or Ronald Reagan after Grenada.

The superpowers themselves, whose contest has not been abolished by the
nuclear revolution (it is the stakes, the costs of failure that have, of
course, been transformed), find that much of their rivalry can be
conducted in traditional ways --- including limited uses of force
---below the level of nuclear alarm. They also find that nuclear
weapons, while---perhapsunusable rationally, can usefully strengthen the
very process that has been so faulty in the prenuclear ages: deterrence
(this is one of the reasons for nuclear proliferation). The pathological
approach interprets [deterrence]{.underline} as expressing the
deterrer\'s belief that his country is good, the enemy\'s is bad. This
is often the case, but it need not be; it [can also reflect the
conviction that one\'s country has interests that are not mere figments
of the imagination, and need to be protected both because of the
material costs of losing them, and because of the values embedded in
them.]{.underline} [As for war planning, it is not a case of
\"psychological denial of unwelcome reality\"]{.underline} (Montville,
1985). [but a --- perhaps futile, perhaps dangerous---necessity in a
world where deterrence may once more fail.]{.underline}

The prescriptions that result from the radicals\' psychological approach
also run into traditionalist objections. [Even if one accepts the
metaphors of collective disease or pathology, one must understand that
the \"cure\" can only be provided by politics. All too often, the
radicals\' cures consist of perfectly sensible recommendations for
lowering tensions, **but fail to tell us how to get them carried
out**]{.underline} ---they only tell us how much better the world would
be, if only \"such rules could be established\" (Deutsch, 1983).

## Framework

### Bataille Flows Neg

#### Bataille admits rules outweigh

**Fortuna, PhD candidate, 09**

(John , *The Political Implications of Sacrifice and Loss in the Thought
of Georges Bataille http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p317285_index.html)*

While it is certainly the case that [Bataille's position
does]{.underline} require some sort of re- working of our practices (or
perhaps more importantly, the way in which we understand those we
currently have) in order to accommodate the experience of sacrificial
loss, this does [not]{.underline} necessarily [entail a complete
upheaval of]{.underline} society and [politics]{.underline}. As
disruptive as sacrifice may be to the stable and logical forms which
tend to comprise profane existence, [it does not seem to be the case
that Bataille is recommending]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} simply
[overturn all things profane]{.underline}. In fact, [Bataille
specifically argues against such actio]{.underline}n where, in Guilty,
he says, [Life is a result of]{.underline} disequilibrium and
[instability. Stable forms are needed to make it possible
however]{.underline}....[To shrink from fundamental stability isn't less
cowardly than to hesitate about shattering it.]{.underline} [Perpetual
instability is more boring than adhering strictly to a
rule]{.underline}, and only what's in existence can be made to come into
disequilibrium, that is, to be sacrificed. The more equilibrium the
object has, the more complete it is, and the greater the disequilibrium
or sacrifice that can result (Bataille 1988b, 28-29). [Perhaps the most
important insight to take from this quote is that sacrifice]{.underline}
(here emphasized as [that which disrupts]{.underline} what is) [depends
upon the logical and stable forms that are marks of]{.underline} the
profane world of work and [utility]{.underline}. [Because sacrifice
might be said to represent a transgression of the norms of the profane
world, it follows that these norms must exist in **order for such a
transgression to occur in the first place**]{.underline}**.** While I
have been emphasizing the importance for Bataille of sacrificial loss
(and to the extent that it follows from it---disruption), in this
passage he seems to be affording some sort of recognition to the
importance of values like stability, that are associated not with the
sacred but rather the profane.

### Debate Solves

#### Debating this shit is good

The ways in which community-based research can be integrated into
society vary. From a governmental point of view, community-based
research can be integrated into a community\'s decision-making process
by promoting reflexive inclusion, which includes transparency,
sustainable equity, and a results-based culture that involves community
members in the process of needs assess- ment, policy development and
oversight (Miller and Rivera 2006). The idea of reflexive inclusion
places the responsibility of the development of culturally acceptable
human rights concepts and frameworks in the hands of the community and
the government in charge of making sure that policies are implemented
effectively. Alternatively, when governments are not open to changes in
decision-making procedures, community-based research can be integrated
into the higher education curriculum (Rivera and Miller 2009). It is
hoped that [when **college students** are **incrementally exposed to
human rights issues early in their careers**, they will **influence**
the professional organizations and civic institutions they later
enter.]{.underline} [This **diffusion of respect for human rights**
throughout society results in the **incremental integration into private
and public spheres**]{.underline}. The incremental integration of human
rights issues accentuates the broader social acceptance of human rights
emphasized in the Deliberative School. Furthermore, [**only**
through]{.underline} acceptance by the broader society, and subsequent
[**institutionalization** in the global community, will the promotion
and enforcement of human rights become possible]{.underline}.
Community-based research brings us closer to that end, closer to an
understanding of others, and closer to a larger understanding of
humanity---a society without borders.

### Law Good

#### The aff's rejection of any attempt at productive reform is congruent with the most regressive features of political conservatism -- vote neg to embrace the possibility for continual tinkering and incremental improvement

Guido Giacomo **Preparata 8**, Associate Professor of Political Economy

"Un(for)giving: Bataille, Derrida, and the Postmodern Denial of the
Gift", p. 191-193

Again, we ask, what could possibly be the benefit in denying a priori
that love, in fact, may be the principle that will eventually win the
contest of endurance versus indifference and/or hatred? [Shorn of its
philosophical pretensions, the argument of Bataille]{.underline} (and
Derrida) [is not much more than sullen proverbializing on the immutable
mediocrity of our modern soul: a soul incapable of great deeds, and
forever bent on the sycophantic acquisition of cumulative
perks]{.underline}. The Liberals would demur, naturally: Self-interest
might not be glorious, they'd say, but it remains nevertheless the sole
propellant to riches, and hence, by way of philanthropic trickle-down,
to the tempered "happiness" of the collectivity. Riches, the postmodern
Batailleans would rejoin, cannot be a vehicle to satisfaction if their
owners are not given the sovereign privilege to blast them with
splendor. To "blast" anything, the Liberals would insist, is, at best, a
savvy PR stunt (i.e., a perfectly legitimate business proposition), or,
at worst, something "irrational." Which reply goes to confirm the thesis
of the Batailleans: that the benevolent gift, truly, does not exist, for
neither of its two contemporary expressions--- as taxes to the
bureaucracy and as the charity of foundations---is driven by a
disinterested love for fellow human beings. As charity, emoluments are
granted in keeping with the donors' wishes, and as taxes, the given
funds are involuntary transfers that fatten an administrative elite on
the one hand, and spur wars on the other. In a modern regime, the
accursed share thus re-emerges as the semi-unintended effect of fiscal
collection. In any case, the Batailleans would argue, the modern
policies of gifting, be they publicly or privately inspired, make a
sonorous mockery of our professed adhesion to the "universal" values of
brotherly union, civility, goodwill, and "human rights." And to that,
the Liberals would respond in the end with a polite, semi-uncooperative
(and interested) silence.∂ Which is to say that the [Liberals, who hold
the reins of power, have understood that they might benefit by making
room for the Bataillean postmoderns]{.underline} in the proprietary area
of academic debate. [The benefit consists in co-opting what presents
itself as the adversarial faction]{.underline}---postmodernism fashions
itself as the true beacon of the dissenting Left---[by identifying
common positions and beliefs]{.underline}. [These beliefs must be
leveraged to keep at bay alternative ways of thinking]{.underline}. In
this instance, [Liberalism and Bataillean anti-humanism appear united by
their common hostility to]{.underline} a [jurisprudential
reform]{.underline} seeking to enact anonymous, that is, free gifting.
The former seems to fear that such a reform would disable the tenure of
business, and the latter sees it as a potential threat to their more or
less unavowed espousal of misanthropic nihilism.∂ This convergence of
interests would also contribute to explaining the otherwise bizarre
triumph in America of thinkers such as Foucault and Derrida. Both, and
especially the former, were tributaries of Bataille. Their successful
launch in the United States is all the more curious as it coincided with
their passing out of vogue in their own country (at the beginning of the
eighties) (Macey, 1993, 430). What is captivating, as mentioned in the
introduction, is that most Foucauldians and Derrideans, of whom there
are presently legions in American academia, are not fully conversant
with the work of Bataille, and therefore tend to dismiss the essential
connection of these latter-day pundits to the baroque and truculent
estheticism of the master. Without bringing to light the Bataillean
imprint, we contend that the true pedagogy of these French postmodern
gurus may not be fully discernible. In truth, both Foucault and Derrida
had no sympathy for the catch-all label of postmodernism, though in
America both came to be irremediably associated with it. Postmodernism,
as known, has become, in the past twenty-five years, a byword for
academia's protean brew of skepticism, relativism, jocose literary
criticism, and anti-colonial invective. Postmodernism's pièce de
résistance is, or course, Foucault's Power/Knowledge, which is a
peculiar distortion of Bataille's theory of the "core." Power/Knowledge
provided a clever discursive structure with which to articulate, without
any attempt to solve it, racial difference in American society.4
Power/knowledge came to freeze such a difference, so to speak. Similar
political aims seem to lurk behind Derrida's re-issue of Bataille's
ontological denial of the gift, or the related theme of the
impossibility of forgiveness, which also appears to be inspired by
Bataille's meditations on the powerful suggestions of the Christian myth
(Bataille, 1970, VIII, 31). [The objective of these philosophical pieces
is to intimate and persuade the reader that "goodness" is an Apollonian
illusion]{.underline}. [Because the anti-humanists, like the majority of
Liberals, are convinced that humans are at bottom egotists, if not
altogether malevolent, they believe it their mission to disabuse us of
any wishful idealism]{.underline}. [This kind of intimation
**indisputably betokens conservative intent**: "whatever is is
right"---no need to fix it]{.underline}. Because men give only to get
something back, say the Batailleans, gifting, and the kind-hearted
suggestion it carries, is an absurdity. Likewise with forgiveness: if I
forgive a tort, says Derrida, it is because the affront suffered thereby
is ultimately tolerable. As such it did not truly require of me any
extraordinarily selfless and magnanimous stretch: in fact, I pardoned
nothing. Therefore there can be no forgiving: what is "unforgivable" is
by definition beyond our powers of sentimental absorption. In
conclusion, as averred by another Bataillean postmodern such as Jean
Baudrillard, we humans are perfect the way we are: dispensers of
merriment and dispensers of sorrow all rolled into one (Baudrillard,
2004, 117). This, the Batailleans sentence, is the "principle of evil,"
and it is the natural state of affairs with which we must always reckon.
[In this regard, the postmodern outlook is compatible, if not perfectly
**identical** with the practical **cynicism** preached by the modern
school of Liberal political economy]{.underline}.

#### The aff's just a guise for tea-party conservatism -- reject their presupposition that the world can't get any better

Guido Giacomo **Preparata 8**, Associate Professor of Political Economy
at the University of Washington, The Catholic Social Science Review 13,
"Un(for)giving: Bataille, Derrida, and the Postmodern Denial of the
Gift", p. 174-175

To repeat, no systematic appraisal of the Bataillean matrix behind
conventional postmodern works will be attempted here. This article will
merely focus on a very specific segment of this important connection,
namely Bataille's treatment of gifting, and its virtual replication in
Derrida, fifty years after its original formulation. This circumscribed
analysis is here presented as an introductory side step into the
intriguing realm of Bataille, and into the semi-unacknowledged legacy
bequeathed by this dark genius on contemporary political economy. In
this sweeping fresco of existential hermeneutics, Bataille's nested
treatise on the gift is nonetheless a significant contribution. The
seminal idea of this particular invective against charity---that it is
unworthy of heroic beings, who need not be shackled by gratitude---was
indeed planted by de Sade in his celebrated Justine. And Bataille was a
careful reader and admirer of the Marquis. [Bataille did
something]{.underline} novel in revisiting this theme. And that was [to
highlight the strident antagonism of his pioneering anti-humanism to the
idealistic hope that generosity and a system of benevolent
emulation]{.underline} supported by a generalized policy of gifting
among free city-states [may act as a shield against]{.underline} man's
[murderous and oligarchic propensities]{.underline}. The thesis of this
article is, then, that Bataille's (and Derrida's) attack on the gift is,
more than by skepticism, prompted by fear. In other words, it is my
suspicion that [behind the obsessive and renewed effort to deny the
beneficial virtues of gifting there lies the determination to
kill]{.underline} in the reader [any hope that this world is
perfectible]{.underline}, that peace and justice may triumph in some
form or other. It is as if [thinkers of Bataille's ilk]{.underline} had
[already made up their minds as to what may be humanly effected in this
world---and this would]{.underline} hitherto [amount to little more that
a series of truces in one endless sequence of painful
tumults]{.underline}. And, therefore, to disabuse the rest of us of the
notion that good can be done, the Batailleans have conducted a
comprehensive critique of our modes of thought and social organization
by laying special emphasis on the systematic failure of mankind's
professed commitment to lofty, humane goals throughout history. [The
postmodern invective against the gift is **merely an economic appendix
of this vast project of anti-humanist catechesis**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [such anti-humanist speculation]{.underline}, despite, or
rather owing to, Bataille's malevolent brilliance, [has endured a
steady, and refreshed season of success in academia]{.underline} (see
for instance, Martyn, 1999) [and public discourse]{.underline} for the
past thirty years, [because its inherent misanthropism and lack of
compassion has proven to be **highly compatible** with the uncaring and
unforgiving ethos of standard Liberal, laissez-faire
economics]{.underline} (Polanyi, 2001, 116-35). And, as such, [it does
stand as one important and fascinating exemplar of conservative
discourse]{.underline}.

### Reform Solves

#### Voting for us affirms the transformational power of oppositional networks to accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks -- larger trajectory of reform can be understood as a strategy for political action

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in
this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.
The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum
concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary
positons in the response to today's dominant forces of globalization:
either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a
defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or
[one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form
of globalization that is equally global.]{.underline} The first poses
neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as
unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the
second is more [clearly posed **against capital itself**, whether
state-regulated or not]{.underline}. The first might rightly be called
an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even
if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the
forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for
this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and
anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any
national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The
first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the
Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions,
repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key
proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT
(Workers\' Party)---in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the
city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT
would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international
prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming
elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the
French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in
the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this
regard, very close to many of the French politicians--- most notably
Jean-Pierre Chevenement---who advocate strengthening national
sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization.
These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of
the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign,
alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the
Forum---not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in
fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have
occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that
have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented
towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of
state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form
that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements
that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis,
organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are
similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their
slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of
them---*que se vayan todos*: the entire political class. And finally, at
the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum
the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty
than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid
organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional
politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. [The
division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the
non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best
understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between
North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds
rather to two different forms of political organization.]{.underline}
The [traditional parties]{.underline} and centralized campaigns
[generally occupy the national sovereignty pole]{.underline}, whereas
the [new movements organized in horizontal networks]{.underline} tend to
cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional,
centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base
away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would
be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This
may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty,
antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the
Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward
the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a
concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one
can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina
that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis
loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain
of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the
fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global
capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational
institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical
oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national
sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these
destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the
same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is
neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global
capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global
level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in
democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in
Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the
democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global
system. Of course, [neither of these perspectives provides an adequate
recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis]{.underline} that would
circumvent IMF prescriptions---and I am not convinced that such a
solution exists. [They]{.underline} rather [present different
**political strategies for action**]{.underline} today [which seek, in
the course of time, to develop **real alternatives to** the current form
of **global rule.**]{.underline} Parties vs networks In a previous
period [we could]{.underline} have [stage]{.underline}d [an
old]{.underline}-style ideological [confrontation between the two
positions]{.underline}. The first could accuse the second of playing
into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and
paving the way for further globalization. [Politics, the one could
continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and
within the nation-state]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} the second
[could reply that national regimes]{.underline} and other forms of
sovereignty, [corrupt]{.underline} and oppressive as they are, are
merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of
confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre---in part
because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace
conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully
occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But
the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do
with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The
traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who
represent them and conduct their battles, [but no one speaks for a
network. How do you argue with a network]{.underline}? [The movements
organized within them do exert]{.underline} their [power]{.underline},
[but they do not proceed through oppositions]{.underline}.
[One]{.underline} of the [**basic characteristic**s]{.underline} **[of
the network form]{.underline}** is that [no two nodes face each other in
contradiction]{.underline}; rather, [they are **always triangulated by a
third**]{.underline}, and then a fourth, [and]{.underline} then [**by an
indefinite number** of others **in the web**]{.underline}. [This
is]{.underline} one of the [characteristic]{.underline}s
[of]{.underline} the Seattle [events that we have had the most trouble
understanding]{.underline}: [groups which we **thought in objective
contradiction** to one another]{.underline}---environmentalists and
trade unions, church groups and anarchists---[were suddenly able to work
together, **in the context of the network**]{.underline} of the
multitude. The [movements]{.underline}, to take a slightly different
perspective, [function something **like** a public sphere]{.underline},
[in]{.underline} the sense [that]{.underline} [they]{.underline} [can
allow full **expression of differences within the common context of open
exchange**.]{.underline} [But that **does not mean that networks are
passive**]{.underline}. [They displace contradictions and operate
instead a]{.underline} kind of alchemy, or rather a [sea
change]{.underline}, [the flow of the movements **transforming the
traditional fixed positions**; networks imposing their force through a
kind of **irresistible undertow**.]{.underline} Like the Forum itself,
the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and
unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to
recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians
gathered at Porto Alegre. [It would be a mistake]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [to try to read the division]{.underline} [according
to]{.underline} the traditional model of **[ideological conflict between
opposing sides]{.underline}**. [Political struggle in the age of network
movements no longer works that way.]{.underline} Despite the apparent
strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the
representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the
struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and
centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old
national leaders gathered at Bandung---imagine Lula of the PT in the
position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as
Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The [leaders]{.underline} can
certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a
conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the
movements. [Eventually]{.underline} they too [will be swept up in the
multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized
elements **into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive
network**.]{.underline}

### Links / Turns

#### Expenditure as a strategy can\'t cope with the changing face of capitalism- it sanitizes neoliberalism 

**GOUX , PhD, 90**

(JEAN-JOSEPH, Laurence H. Favrot Professor Emeritus of French Studies @
Rice Yale French Studies, No. 78, On Bataille (1990), pp. 206-224)

[Everything suggests that Bataille was unable to articulate the my-
stical tension toward sovereign self-consciousness \"without form and
mode,\" \"pure expenditure\" (224) with a utopia of social life that
would make it possible, nor to explain in a developed capitalist soci-
ety the consumption of the surplus beyond its reinvestment in pro-
duction]{.underline}. Now it is quite clear that **[today\'s capitalism
has come a long way from the Calvinist ethic that presided at its
beginning.]{.underline}** The [val- ues of thrift, sobriety and
asceticism no longer have]{.underline} the [place]{.underline} that they
held when Balzac could caricature the dominant bourgeois men- tality
with the characters of pere Grandet or the usurer Gobseck. [It is
doubtful that the spirit of capitalism]{.underline}, which according to
Weber is expressed with an almost classical purity in Benjamin
Franklin\'s principles (\"he who kills a five shilling coin assassinates
all that it could have produced: entire stacks of sterling pounds\")
\[cited by Bataille, 163\], could today be considered the spirit of the
times. Un- doubtedly, the pace at which all residual sacred elements
inherited from feudalism are eliminated has quickened. But [hasn\'t
contempo- rary society undergone a transformation of the ethic of
consumption, desire, and pleasure that renders the classical
(]{.underline}Weberian) [analyses of the spirit of capitalism **(to
which Bataille subscribes**) inadequate?]{.underline} [If the great
opposition between the sacred and the profane no longer structures
social life, if communal, sacrificial, and glorious expendi- ture has
**been replaced by private expenditure**]{.underline}**,** [it is no
less true that advanced **capitalism seems to exceed the principle of
restricted econ- omy** and utility that presided at its beginning. No
society has \"wasted\" as much as contemporary capitalism]{.underline}.
What is the form of this waste, of this excess? [These questions strike
directly at the historical situation and philosophical signification of
Bataille\'s though]{.underline}t. [Is it not clear that his passion for
the \"notion of expenditure]{.underline},\"-which, beginning in 1933, is
the matrix of all his economic reflections to come-[emerge precisely at
a **turning point in the history of capitalism**]{.underline}, in the
1920s and 1930s, which also saw the appearance of Lukacs and Heidegger?2
[Can we not perceive within the principles of secularization and re-
stricted economics that were the strength of early capitalism an inter-
nal conflict that undermines them, and puts capitalism in contradic-
tion with itself]{.underline} ? (209-210)

#### Failing to grasp this crucial shift in capitalist strategy makes their politics useless 

**GOUX , PhD, 90**

(JEAN-JOSEPH, Laurence H. Favrot Professor Emeritus of French Studies @
Rice Yale French Studies, No. 78, On Bataille (1990), pp. 206-224)

[Let me make it clear that, if there is no question of my subscribing
without discrimination to Gilder\'s apologetic discourse, on the
other]{.underline} [hand I take it quite seriously as a pointed
ideological legitimation strategy of eighties-capitalism]{.underline}.
[Gilder\'s theory is exemplary as an attempt to formulate a morality of
capitalism at odds with the heritage of the Enlightenment. If his theory
is weak as political econ- omy, it is highly significant]{.underline}
(although at times disquieting)4 [as eco- nomic politics. Any social
critic]{.underline} (to go back to a phrase that Bataille would not
disavow) [who overlooks this type of contemporary justifi- cation risks
missing the true target and overlooking once more cap- italism\'s
resources and metamorphoses.]{.underline} Furthermore, perhaps Mauss
would not have disavowed Gilder\'s attempt in principle. The
anthropologist does not hesitate to see in the skillful operations of
potlatch on the part of the Iroquois (in whose simple disinterestedness
he is careful not to believe) a pre- figuration of the operations of
capitalism. And it is also his aim, at the end of The Gift to search for
something in the contemporary world that could prolong the process of
gift and countergift of primitive societies. It is not, however, in
\"the cold reason of the merchant, of the banker and of the capitalist\"
(The Gift, Chapter 4, Conclusion, vol. 2) that he detects that
prolongation, but rather in the liberality of the industrialist who
creates family insurance funds or, better still, in national health
insurance, where the community gives to the work- ers something other
than a simple salary. We are far from the insane squandering fantasized
by Bataille, as well as from the innovator\'s generous risk invoked by
Gilder. There still remains the question of why neither Mauss nor
Bataille have pointed out, in some decisive mechanism of capital, a
contemporary continuation of potlatch, while Gilder, in 1980, does not
hesitate to resort to that ethnological reference, and to make it the
guarantee of a moral basis. The reason is that [a
transformation]{.underline} (already at work but still concealed) **[has
become manifest]{.underline}**. [In the capitalism of abundance the
distinction between luxury and non- luxury has become
indeterminable]{.underline}. Clearly, [it is only in a regime of luxury,
where everything is superfluous, that demand cannot be as- signed and
becomes open to possibilities that are less and less predict-
able]{.underline}. [It is only in a regime of surplus consumption that
the subject]{.underline} (the client who chooses) [does not know his own
desire, and that supply]{.underline} (founded on still unknown, still
unimagined technological and aesthetic possibilities[) must necessarily
precede demand]{.underline}. [The distinction is no longer between the
necessary and the superfluous, but between several as yet unimagined
possibilities. This is why seduction, the aesthetization of merchandise,
plays a primordial role. It is vital for this supply economy to deny the
naturalness of needs- including the very notion of need and utility (in
the trivial sense). In this sense we are **witnessing the aesthetization
of political economy**]{.underline}. (213-5)

#### This isn\'t a random missed prediction- Bataille\'s failure to anticipate hedonistic capitalism invalidates his entire sociology 

**GOUX , PhD, 90**

(JEAN-JOSEPH, Laurence H. Favrot Professor Emeritus of French Studies @
Rice Yale French Studies, No. 78, On Bataille (1990), pp. 206-224)

[Along with this \"postbourgeois\" capitalism that at once contra- dicts
Bataille\'s sociological interpretation and confirms his on- tological
vision, explode the **sociocultural contradictions of cap-
italism**]{.underline}. Daniel Bell has convincingly shown that [with
the develop- ment of mass consumption and mass credi]{.underline}t
(which he situates in the 1930s) [the puritan ideology of early
capitalism entered into contra- diction with an increasingly hedonist
mode of consumption]{.underline} favored by capitalism. [The
entrepreneur\'s need to revive seduction]{.underline}, to re- spond to
competition with promises of evermore complex pleasures, [inscribes him
in a consumerist ideology directly at odds with the \"bourgeois\"
virtues of sobriety, thrift]{.underline}, and hard work that had assured
the development of production. [In this way, the strict moral confines
necessary for production enter into contradiction with the ethical
liberation]{.underline} (even moral license) [necessary to
consumption]{.underline}.8 **[Bataille does not seem to have foreseen
this conflict born of abundance and the extraordinary sophistication of
production]{.underline}**. [The Weberian image of capitalism that he
maintains]{.underline}, the slightly obsolete conviction that
Franklin\'s precepts of economy and sobriety represent capitalism\'s
morals in its pure state, [seem to indicate that Bataille did not
imagine the paradoxical situation of postindustrial capitalism where
only the appeal to compete infinitely in unproductive
consumption]{.underline} (through comfort, luxury, technical refinement,
the superfluous) [allows for the development of production.]{.underline}
(218-9)

### At: death

#### There's no impact to servility and your authors don't say that DEATH is good, just that FEAR OF DEATH is bad -- death itself destroys the potential for radical negativity, which turns the case 

**Gemerchak 12** Christopher M. Gemerchak is Post-Doctoral Fellow at the
Institute of Philosophy at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.
Sunday of the Negative, The: Reading Bataille Reading Hegel, 2-1-12,
43-45,

The situation establishing the potions described above is in fact not an
abstract one, but, rather, occurs in a ﬁght to the death between the two
play- ers---a ﬁght that Bataille obliquely, yet signiﬁcantly refers to
as "The game" (Lg/ea)\" Conflict is the ﬁrst step on the path to
intersubjectivity, the sphere of recognition, for without this conﬂict,
"the conscious subject would remain in its routine of self-certainty and
subjective knowledge." And this "ﬁght" occurs precisely because each
subject involved views itself as the essential real- ity, independent
from all otherness, a view which is then challenged by the other who
holds the same attitude toward himself. What is then essential to
realize is that the positions of this intersubjective relation are
established by the combatant's respective attitudes towards life and
death, for it is above all the disregard for life that conﬁrms an end to
otherness and dependence.\"0 More speciﬁcally: the one who becomes the
slave, when confronted with the possibility of death and propelled into
anxiety at this prospect, chooses not to take the risk of dying and opts
for a life of servitude and dependence. The hor- ror of death and
subsequent ﬂight from it is the origin of slavery in particular, and is
the precondition of conscious individualization in general. The slave\'s
shying away from death shows that he prefers to remain tied to the given
world, which amounts to a choice for servility over freedom, dependence
over self-suﬂiciency. This is negatively established through Hegel's
principle---one that is essential for Bataille---that "it is only
through staking one\'s life that freedom is won."\'\" [The slave does
retain a certain freedom in the ability to negate and transform the
given world, **even if this is accomplished under compulsion of
fear**]{.underline}, but in truth the freedom of negativ- ity is hollow
if it loses the strength to risk life itself. Indeed, the fundamental
condition of possibility for genuine self-consciousness is the
willingness to freely risk one's life. And the refusal to squander one's
vital resources repre- sents for Bataillc nothing less than an
abdication from the possibility of real- izing one's ultimate truth. It
therefore seems that we should look to the other side of the equation,
to the one who accepts the possibility of death for a nonvital,
essentially use- less end---for pure prestige---to find the
representation of freedom that Bataillc is seeking. It is the master who
represents for Bataille the sovereign attribute in Hegel\'s dialectic,
which is "the fact of a \[hu\]man\'s having staked his\[their\] whole
being\" through the "reckless expenditure of vital resources."" And it
is this expenditure---which we will later encounter in one of Bataille's
privileged paradigms, the potlatch---that carries the connotation of
sovereign freedom, whereby one shows that one is "not attached to any
speciﬁc existence . . . is not tied up with life."3 Or as
[Bataillc]{.underline} repeatedly [states]{.underline}; the master, [the
sovereign]{.underline} existence, [escapes the anguish of
death]{.underline}, [treating death "as if it were not.\"]{.underline}4
We will examine this in greater detail below. U What we must note here,
[however]{.underline}, is that [Bataille could not be more clear about
the derivation of his notions of "sovereignty" and "servility'" from
Hegel]{.underline}. He states: "In the Hegelian dialectic, the sovereign
share of man has indiﬂ\'er- ence to death, the risk of death confronted,
for its foundation, the servile part proceeds from the fear, or moreover
the horror of death."5 At ﬁrst glance, Bataille's "sovereignty" indeed
seems identical to Hegel's mastery (Hmcbaﬂ). for both are established
through risking or putting into play (mettre enjeu) the entirety of
one's existence. And even though Bataille again states that "the
Master's attitude implies sovereignty" in the risk of death without
biological reasons, it is essential for us to realize how and why these
notions differ rather than simply illustrating their common origin. The
ﬁrst difference to note is established by two interrelated conditions of
mastery: firstly, **[the master must stay alive despite having accepted
the risk of death]{.underline}**; and secondly, the prestige gained
through his lack of concern for life is put to use by exerting power
over the slave, by commanding the vanquished to work. The master thereby
prof- its from his risk. Both of these conditions pertaining to Hegel's
mastery thereby fall into the paradigm of Bataille\'s servility: the
projection of the self into the future, which again implies the fear of
death. Sovereignty, as we will see, must lie elsewhere. With respect to
mastery, however, the former condition---**[limiting the risk in
accordance with Hegel\'s economy of life]{.underline}**---**[is
necessary if the possibility of reaching the truth of self-consciousness
is not to be lost]{.underline}**, **[for which this consciousness must
be maintained]{.underline}**. We will soon see the extensive
ramiﬁcations of this imperative, but for now, we may simply posit that
**[if one of the combatants physically dies, the dialectic that
constitutes the history of meaning stops, never attaining its desired
result, never proﬁting from the risk]{.underline}**. Should the ﬁght end
in total loss, death would be present as nonproductive or "abstract
negation" rather than the negation characteristic of consciousness,
"which supersedes in such a way as to preserve and maintain what is
superseded, and consequently survives its own supersession." That is,
**[biological death would not reveal the concrete, eﬁcacious negativity
that yields self-consciousness of one's own negativity, and which
thereby give: a meaning to death]{.underline}**.\" Therefore, while the
master does in fact seem to rise above the concern for life, sovereignly
putting that life at stake, **[the meaning of this risk is only conﬁrmed
if the stakes are ultimately limited]{.underline}**. **[Should one drive
headlong into death one undergoes the risk of losing that for which one
has staked one\'s life]{.underline}**---**[the meaning of that
risk]{.underline}**. Therefore, "in this experience \[facing death in
the ﬁght\], self**[---consciousness learns that life is as essential to
it as pure self- consciousness]{.underline}** \[the realization of
absolute negativity\].\"\"' **[The moment of risk is therefore only
meaningful to the extent that it respects life and is in a position to
proﬁt from this risk in the future.]{.underline}**\"0 This is the comedy
transcribed by reason, a comedy of compromise, which Derrida posits
should elicit a "burst of laughter from Bataillc. Through a ruse of
life, that is, of reason, life has stayed alive. . . . Such is the truth
of life. Through this recourse to the AW- brmg, which conserves the
stakes, remains in control of the play, limiting and elaborating it by
giving it form and meaning, this economy of life restricts itself to
conservation . . . henceforth, everything covered by the name lordship
collapses into comedy."1 Yet again, we will have reason to question
whether the reasons Bataille would laugh are those that Derrida
attributes to him. Whether, that is, Bataille will resort to his own
ruses in order to aﬁirm life in complicity with death.

#### \"Playing with mass death\" isn\'t just violent to life -- it will play-out with disparate race and class violence -- turns their root cause claims

**Wolfe \'13** (Cary, Before the Law: Humans and Other Animals in a
Biopolitical Frame, University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 59-60)

Be that as it may, Esposito's position, pragmatically speaking, fares no
better. First, it replays all the quandaries around biocentrism brought
to light during the 1970s and 1980s in North America during the heyday
of the deep ecology movement---debates that Esposito (or for that matter
his fellow Italian political philosophers) would have little reason,
perhaps, to know about. As Tim Luke notes, [if all forms of life are
given equal value, then we face questions such as the following: "Will
we allow anthrax or cholera microbes to attain self-realization in
wiping out sheep herds or human kindergartens? Will we continue to deny
salmonella or botulism micro-organisms their equal rights when we
process the dead carcasses of animals and plants that we
eat?"]{.underline}30 In the face of such challenges, all that Esposito
can offer is to retrofit Spinoza's concept of natural right to make "the
norm the principle of unlimited equivalence for every single form of
life." 31 The general idea here---and I will return to it in more detail
in a moment---seems to be that this new norm will operate as a sort of
homeostatic mechanism balancing the creative flourishing of various life
forms. As Esposito characterizes it, " the juridical order as a whole is
the product of this plurality of norms and the provisional result of
their mutual equilibrium," and for this reason no "normative criterion
upon which exclusionary measures" could be based is possible.32 But such
a position---and its key markers in the foregoing quotation are "
plurality" and " equilibrium"---is in essence no different from deep
ecology's guiding principles of biocentrism (or, in a slightly more
refined version that Esposito would be forced to reject, biodiversity).
[There are perhaps those who would respond to Luke's foregoing questions
in the affirmative]{.underline}---who would argue that, yes, all forms
of life should be equally allowed to take their course, even if it means
a massive die-off of the species Homo sapiens. But [biopolitically
speaking, that hardly solves the problem,]{.underline} of course,
[because when we ask what the demographic distribution of such an event
would likely be, we realize that the brunt would surely be absorbed by
largely black and brown poor populations of the south, while those in
the " rich North Atlantic democracies"]{.underline} (to use Richard
Rorty's no-nonsense phrase) [who could afford to protect themselves
would surely do so.]{.underline}33 And [even privileging biodiversity,
which would seem in tune with the "qualitative and quantitative
expansion" of life that Esposito values, is equally question-begging
because, as Luke notes, that means that rare species and endangered
individuals are by definition more valuable than those that are more
common]{.underline} (and this is only thinking for the moment on the
level of the creature, not of the microorganism), [so that,]{.underline}
for example, [given a choice between saving a California condor and a
human child, one would be obliged to choose the former]{.underline}.34
[Thus biocentrism,]{.underline} as Patrick Curry observes, "[is both
intellectually and metaphysically]{.underline} [implausible," and it is
also "hopelessly impractical as a guide to action; you cannot ask
anyone]{.underline} (let alone everyone) [to live as if literally every
life-form---a lethal virus, say---has equal value to all the
others.]{.underline}"35

#### Their willingness to "play with death" is bad -- it *[locks-in privilege]{.underline}* and *[violently elides the differing experiences of queer subjects]{.underline}*. We can win on this alone.

For me, [reflecting on "no futures]{.underline}"---a plurality that
signals the multitudes at stake in a conversation about futurity---is a
meditation. It [pushes me to think about]{.underline} the possibilities
but, more importantly, the [imagined impossibilities for human
existence.]{.underline} Lee Edelman (2004) posed a provocative challenge
to LGBT-identifying people's rush to reproduce normative kinship
structures through marriage and child rearing. [At the same time, **the
argument lacked any textured understanding of what happens to those
formations when they take root in specific cultural contexts and social
situations.**]{.underline} There is nothing clearly normative about,
say, lesbian couples, with toddlers in tow, returning to rural towns to

anything but a queer [celebration of antiestablishment]{.underline},
[could not make room for]{.underline} either the [deeply queer

it avoid reductively assuming]{.underline} that [there is some

youth I worked with did not.]{.underline}** [In the face]{.underline}
[of their social realities and conflicted desires]{.underline} for them,
[they lived a different]{.underline} queer [future.]{.underline} Neither
a lesser nor a more morally righteous version of the future than the one
theorized by Edelman: just different.

vision ultimately placed all value in his own strength -- he both
embraced his own status as an invalid and sought to "overcome" it. His
own fate of insanity should have tipped people off as to the common
result, but instead his supporters laud his "genius" as being such
\*because\* of his physical weakness.¶ Nietzsche was endlessly
optimistic, but optimism is not reality and global warming,

It is an extreme example but one that is nevertheless entirely too
common, and one that I came perilously close to taking as a model.
[There was a time in my life where I took pride in]{.underline} being a
"social justice warrior" on Reddit, [ticking the boxes of
others']{.underline} mistakes, [missteps]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[misspoken words,]{.underline} cruelly [scolding]{.underline} people,
looking for [those who were "doing it wrong"]{.underline} as a means of
validating my own sense of integrity as an activist, as if each person I
roasted would be a talisman against the same thing happening to me ever
again. It was only when I discovered that I had made someone cry for
hours that I took a long step back and asked myself if I was really
making the world a better place by doing this. I had at last allowed
myself to acknowledge that **[this was not what I wanted]{.underline}**
to do **[as an activist.]{.underline}** **[At its best]{.underline}**,
[activism is]{.underline} not merely opposition to what is, it is also
**[constructive of what will be]{.underline}**. [Ours is not a utopia of
negatives]{.underline}-- a world [without this, without
that]{.underline}, and so forth-- but also a world of affirmatives and
possibilities. This swirling gyre of **[rage]{.underline}** [and
ressentiment]{.underline} **[is a]{.underline}** terrible [**artefact of
oppression**, and]{.underline} one we ought not consign ourselves to. It
is [**not a wormhole to liberation**, however much we may wish it to
be.]{.underline} What aroused my concern was the fact that there are too
many people, in the trans community alone, who feel like they are unable
to call it their community and find shelter there because the tenor of
discourse is so corrosive as to be just as stressful and antagonistic as
the outside world. I hear this from a number of people who are close to
me and have contributed mightily to activist communities with labour,
art, and struggle-- and I hear it from neophytes and outsiders who wish
to join but find themselves put off by the rancour they hear from
within. One example of the latter was a trans woman named Deb who
commented on an article I wrote criticising the culture that led to the
vicious online firestorm surrounding Carolyn Petit and her review of GTA
V. Deb worried that that same "poisonous attitude" was creeping into
"otherwise nice places," going on to cite examples of speech in queer
communities that troubled her. My reply was at pains to draw a clear
distinction between oppressive speech and counter-oppressive speech, and
to assert that the difference in power between the two was not trivial.
Nevertheless, her core points could not be denied and so I addressed
those at greater length. What I said there is, I think, a good way to
close: "It is not reasonable to compare the angry speech of a powerless
minority to the "hate speech" (in the legal and sociological sense of
that term) of a privileged group, but there is an ethical argument to be
made. We may not materially disadvantage cis people when we speak in
such overtly aggressive ways, but we do something equally bad-- and you
exemplify this-- we isolate our community members and corrode the very
community that is meant to be a shelter for us against an often uncaring
world. I do not wish to be in a community where spite and anger are the
prevailing emotions, however justified they may be in some cosmic sense.
More than cis people, we owe it to each other to make our community more
productive. The simple and ineluctable truth about our corrosive
call-out culture is that it's part of this larger problem I addressed,
where we use the unique nature of the internet to do harm. People saying
that others should commit suicide, die in a fire, or making death
threats are not acceptable-- whoever says them. And as feminists and
social justice activists, we must make that clearer without indulging in
the overused and disingenuous argument that oppression makes that sort
of expression valid." We must remember that considering the impact of
our words and the register in which they are spoken is not genuflection
to the oppressor, but love and respect for our peers. I would now take
this one step further to say that while sheltering our community members
must always take priority, [we must]{.underline} also [challenge
ourselves to be merciful]{.underline} [to those who make themselves our
enemies, and keep their humanity in sight]{.underline} even as they
denude themselves of it with petty hatred. **[We can do more
than]{.underline}** simply **[meet their cruelty with ineffectual
rage,]{.underline}** and we can do more than simply shelter in place
from their privilege. It is time that we took our convictions to their
logical conclusion and set our sights higher than the call outs of
particular points of failure evinced by some hapless individual; it is
time we took the next step so many in our communities are already
taking, to a social justice activism recommitted to changing social
structures and not just creating echo chambers to declaim against what
we have. In Mattie Brice's words we "need to keep in mind that we're
fighting the system that uses people to marginalise others, not the
people themselves." Throughout this piece I have, likely to the
consternation of some, been less careful with my uses of the terms
"anger" and "rage" than some of the other critics and activists I have
cited. I did this in part because I think it can be healthy to be
critical about what we admit as "anger" and thus acceptable under the
dominant paradigms of activist discourse. One can take the excellent
tack that Aevee Bee took in her article and say that "anger isn't abuse
and abuse isn't anger," recognising that abuse is not something we
should excuse with the ennoblement of anger that we indulge, but we can
also think about the efficacy of even "acceptable" forms of anger. Why?
Because I believe that lack of circumspection is at the heart of the
problem. We allow important activist insights to metamorphose into
inflexible rules, rather than useful information to help us make sense
of an ever-undulating landscape. Yes, anger is useful and sometimes
vitally necessary. But we can hold onto that while judging activist
tactics on a case by case basis. Rather than applying blanket rules
("all questioning of anger is tone policing") we can be nimbly
thoughtful in our assessments and recognise that not every problem we
face is the nail to anger's hammer. **[Justice does not take the shape
of punishment]{.underline}** eagerly **[dispensed.]{.underline}** [Let
us recommit to]{.underline} the just creed that has summoned us to this
work: a clarion call that resonates with our shared humanity and compels
us towards [a more compassionate and merciful understanding]{.underline}
of justice-- surely we owe it to ourselves.

Now on some points in his psychological observation Nietzsche
undoubtedly was right; he was right for instance to teach us to be wary
of one who finds other men most satisfactory when they are in need of
his help, and to be wary also of the one who hates himself. [At certain
points his observation]{.underline}, and his anticipation of depth
psychology, [shows him as brilliant psychologist. But one could not see
Nietzsche as one who had a great knowledge of life and of the human
heart. He describes convincingly what *he knew* thoroughly, as he knew
the life of the lonely genius, the creative artists of
thinker]{.underline}. It is, however, noticeable that [his
picture]{.underline} of the strong noble man [fails to carry conviction
**when it deviates from his model**]{.underline}; what he says about the
conditions for his man's health seems to stem largely from his belief
that the overriding and underlying principle of human behavior was the
will to power. Now [it is notorious that general theories about the
springs of action are traps for philosophers, and Nietzsche, who tried
to work on a world historical scale, **is an obvious victim of** the
**delusion** of having seen whole]{.underline}. This world have to be
shown, but prima facie, **[one has no reason to trust Nietzsche's views
of human nature beyond a very limited perspective,]{.underline}** and
one quite inadequate for this case. [There is no reason to suppose that
we really are in the dilemma that he insists on]{.underline}- that, we
either sacrifice the weak or else deform strong. [And]{.underline} in a
way [**events have caught up with Nietzsche.** How could one see the
present dangers that the world is in as showing that there is too much
pity and too little egoism around? One wonders what Nietzsche
himself,]{.underline} in some ways a most humane man, [would have said

### At: Bataille VTL

#### Bataille too obsessed with momentary "ecstasy in life" -- ignores value of living.

[Life is a serious business]{.underline} of highly charged temporal
stakes, involving a being's struggle to secure for itself the experience
of pleasure time/free time rather than pain time/slave time. [Since
lived time is a living stake, death is not the profound phenomenon that
Bataille thinks it is. For one who is racked by drawn-out pain, the pain
of death]{.underline} situated at the end of time [is an irrelevance.
And for one who is caught up in the throes of extended pleasure, the
dubious pleasure of death is likewise irrelevant. Death, far from being
profound, may simply provide a pragmatic escape from a life of
pain]{.underline} and toil, [or a simple halt to a life of
pleasure]{.underline} and freedom. [We can see death as important to
time]{.underline} in that it is the end of the great game of time, the
great flow. [But death is relative in importance to time for the same
reason; it is simply the end of the great game of time]{.underline}, a
game without which it would be pure abstraction. [However, we are not
suggesting that death has absolutely no importance for living beings. On
the contrary. By countering Bataille's view of death,]{.underline} which
tries to domesticate death through attempting to engage it in 'intimate'
dialogue, and [which tries to make political gain out of death, we can
see death as a real, non-negotiable phenomenon.]{.underline} Death can
no longer be thought of as an ambiguous but essentially accessible
deity, but must instead be seen as that which wipes out real substantial
time with no hope of appeal. Death can now be viewed as a certain
element in the game of time, as something to be dreaded or desired as
the end of time, but which has no fixed moral or political meaning in
itself. By affirming the reality of time we are in fact affirming the
reality of death, and so we are proposing a more tragic philosophy than
the one Bataille proposes -- which is ironic, given that Bataille is
considered by most postmodernist/ post-structuralist philosophers to be
perhaps the cruellest thinker.

### General Indicts of Bataille / Prodicts of Util

#### Self Preservation is a pre-req to expenditure 

**Itzkowitz, Prof. philosophy Marietta, 99**

(Kenneth, *To witness spectacles of pain: The hypermorality of Georges
Bataille,* College Literature Vol. 26, No. 1, Cultural Violence (Winter,
1999), pp. 19-33 )

[Yet in our lives there are also limits]{.underline}. [It is unlikely
that Bataille would applaud Manson for the same reason he ultimately
rejects Sade]{.underline}. [They are both indiscriminate]{.underline};
[they both go too far]{.underline}. \"Continuity is what we are after,\"
Bataille confirms, but generally only if that continuity which the death
of discontinuous beings can alone establish is not the victor in the
long run. What we desire is to bring into a world founded on
discontinuity all the continuity such a world can sustain. De Sade\'s
aberration exceeds that limit. (Bataille 1962, 13) In other words, [our
wasteful consumption must also have limits]{.underline}. [To actually
approve of our own self-destruction goes too far]{.underline}. Later on
in Death and Sensuality, Bataille continues, Short of a paradoxical
capacity to defend the indefensible, no one would suggest that the
cruelty of the heroes of Justine and Juliette should not be
wholeheartedly abominated. It is a denial of the principles on which
humanity is founded. [We are bound to reject something that would end in
the ruin of all our works]{.underline}. [If instinct urges us to destroy
the very thing we are building we must condemn those instincts and
defend ourselves from them]{.underline}. (Bataille 1962, 179-80) This
passage is crucial for understanding Bataille\'s ethics. [Usually
Bataille writes on behalf of the violence that remains unaffected by
absolute prohibitions]{.underline}. Prohibitions cannot obviate this
transformative violence. There is always ample motive to produce the
experiences of sacred transformation, i.e., to transgress the
prohibitions. [Yet self-**preservation is also a fundamental** value for
Bataille]{.underline}; **[there is also ample motive to resist the
violence that denies the value of the well being of life
itself]{.underline}**. As he says in the second of the above passages,
[we must condemn what threatens to destroy us]{.underline}; [our
sovereign aspirations can be taken too far]{.underline}. [In another
passage he speaks of our need]{.underline} \"[to become aware of . . .
\[ourselves\] and to know clearly what . . . \[our\] sovereign
aspirations are in order to limit their possibly disastrous
consequences]{.underline}\" (1962, 181). [It is when we are ignorant of
these aspirations that we are most vulnerable to them, enacting them
anyway, albeit inattentively]{.underline}.

#### Acting to help others generates meaning

**May 5** -- Todd May 5, philo prof at Clemson, "To change the world, to
celebrate life", Philosophy & Social Criticism, vol 31, nos 5--6,
517--531

What are we to make of these references? We can, to be sure, see the
hand of Heidegger in them. But we may also, and for present purposes
more relevantly, see an intersection with Foucault's work on freedom.
[There is an ontology of freedom]{.underline} at work here, one that
situates freedom not in the private reserve of an individual but in the
unfinished character of any historical situation. [There is more to our
historical juncture]{.underline}, as there is to a painting, [than
appears to us on the surface of its visibility]{.underline}. [The trick
is to recognize this, and to take advantage of it, not only with our
thoughts but with our lives]{.underline}. [And that is why]{.underline},
in the end, [there can be no such thing as a sad
revolutionary]{.underline}. **[To seek to change the world is to offer a
new form of life-celebration]{.underline}**. [It is to articulate a
fresh way of being]{.underline}, which is at once a way of seeing,
thinking, acting, and being acted upon. It is to fold Being once again
upon itself, this time at a new point, to see what that might yield.
[There is]{.underline}, as Foucault often reminds us, [no guarantee that
this]{.underline} fold [will not]{.underline} itself [turn out to
contain the intolerable]{.underline}. In a complex world with which we
are inescapably entwined, a world we cannot view from above or outside,
[there is no certainty about the results of our experiments. Our
politics are constructed from]{.underline} the same
[vulnerability]{.underline} that is the stuff of our art and our daily
practices. **[But to refuse to experiment is to resign oneself to the
intolerable; it is to abandon both the struggle to change the world and
the opportunity to celebrate living within it]{.underline}**. [And to
seek one aspect without the other]{.underline} -- life-celebration
without world-changing, world-changing without life-celebration -- [is
to refuse to acknowledge]{.underline} the chiasm of body and world that
is [the wellspring of both]{.underline}. [If we are to celebrate our
lives, if we are to change our world, then]{.underline} perhaps [the
best place to begin to think is our bodies]{.underline}, which are the
openings to celebration and to change, and perhaps the point at which
the war within us that I spoke of earlier can be both waged and
resolved. That is the fragile beauty that, in their different ways, both
MerleauPonty and Foucault have placed before us. [The question before us
is whether, in our lives and in our politics, we can be worthy of
it]{.underline}.

#### Anti-util leads to war 

**Wolin, PhD, 04**

(Richard, *Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology* in
[The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from
Nietzsche to Postmodernism]{.underline} )

[In the worldview of both Bataille and that of German young
conservatives, war plays an essential, positive role]{.underline}. It
serves as a means of dissolving the *principium individuationis*: the
principle of a bourgeois subjectivity, on which the homogenous order of
society - a world of loneliness and fragmentation -- depends. [For,
according to Bataille, "the *general* movement of life is\...
accomplished beyond the demands of individuals."^32^ It is in precisely
this spirit that he celebrates the non-utilitarian nature of "combat" or
"war" as a type of aestheticist end in itself:]{.underline}
"*Glory\...*expresses [a movement of senseless frenzy, of measureless
expenditure of energy, which the fervor of combat
presupposes.]{.underline} Combat it glorious in that it is always beyond
calculation at some moment."^33^ For the same reasons, Bataillsssse
eulogizes those premodern "warrier societies in which pure, uncalculated
violence and ostentatious forms of combat held sway."^34^ [For under
such conditions, war]{.underline} was not made subservient to the vulgar
ends of enterprise and accumulation, as is the case for modern-day
imperialism, but [served as a glorious end in itself. Yet in the early
1930s, it was precisely this aestheticist celebration of "violence for
violence's sake," or "war for war's sake," that Benjamin viewed as the
essence of modern fascism]{.underline}. As he remarks in a well known
passage: "*Fiat ars -- pereat mundus*," says fascism, and, as Marinetti
admits, expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense
pereption that has been changed by technology\...[Mankind]{.underline},
which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian
gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation [has reached such a
degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of the first order]{.underline}. This is the situation of
politics which fascism is rendering aesthetic.^35^ [In Bataille's
thought war serves as the harbinger of a cultural transfiguration in
which the prismacy of self-subsistent subjectivity would be replaced by
the values of an]{.underline} "unavowable" or "[ecstatic
community":]{.underline} that is, a community that would no longer be
governed by the goals of a "visual culture" -- transparency,
self-identity, etc. -- but instead, those of self-laceration,
difference, and finitude. [In fact this Bataille-inspired program of an
ecstatic community has been quite explicitly carried forth and
explored]{.underline} in the political writings of Maurice Blanchot (*La
Communaute inavouable;* 1983) and Jean-Luc Nancy (*La Communaute
desoeuvree;* 1985).

#### Immanence is awful 

**Nancy, PhD, 91**

(Jean-Luc, *The Unsacrificeable\** Yale French Studies, No. 79,
Literature and the Ethical Question (1991), pp. 20-38 )

But if sovereignty is nothing, if the "obscure God" is only the
obscurity of desire ecstatic in the face of itself, [if existence
arranges itself only towards its own finitude]{.underline}, then we must
think apart from sacrifice. On the one hand, what is at stake since the
beginning of the Western sublation of sacrifice should definitively be
acknowledged: strictly speaking we know nothing decisive about the old
sacrifice. [We need to admit that what we consider as a mercenary
exchange]{.underline} ("Here is the butter...") [sustained and gave
meaning to billions of individual and collective existences, and we do
not know how to think about what founds this gesture]{.underline}. (We
can only guess, confusedly, that this barter in itself goes beyond
barter.) [On the contrary, we know that, for us, it is absolutely
impossible to declare]{.underline}: "[here are the lives, where are the
others]{.underline}?" (all the others: our other lives, the life of a
great Other, the other of life and the other life in general).
Consequently, on the other hand, it should be definitively acknowledged
that the Western economy of sacrifice has come to a close, and that it
is closed by the decomposition of the sacrificial apparatus itself,
[that bloody transgression by which the "moment of the finite" would be
transcended and appropriated infinitely]{.underline}. But [finitude is
not a]{.underline} "[moment]{.underline}" in a process or an economy. [A
finite existence does not have to let its meaning spring forth through a
destructive explosion of its finitude]{.underline}. [Not only does it
not have to do so; in a sense it cannot even do so]{.underline}: thought
rigorously, thought according to its *Ereignis*,
"[finitude]{.underline}" [signifies that existence cannot be
sacrificed]{.underline}. [It cannot be sacrificed because, in itself, it
is already, not sacrificed, but offered to the world]{.underline}.
[There is a resemblance, and the two can be mistaken for one another;
and yet, there is nothing more dissimilar]{.underline}. One could say:
existence is in essence sacrificed. To say this would be to reproduce,
in one of its forms, the fundamental utterance of Western sacrifice. And
we would have to add this major form, which necessarily follows: that
existence is, in its essence, sacrifice. To say that existence is
offered is no doubt to use a word from the sacrificial vocabulary (and
if we were in the German language, it would be the same word: Opfer,
Aufopfertmg). But it is an attempt to mark that, if we have to say that
existence is sacrificed, it is not in any case sacrificed by anyone, nor
is it sacrificed to anything. \"Existence is offered\" means the
finitude of existence. Finitude is not negativity cut out of being and
granting access, through this cutting, to the restored integrity of
being or to sovereignty. Finitude utters what Bataille utters in saying
that sovereignty is nothing. Finitude simply corresponds to the
generative formula of the thought of existence, which is the thought of
the finitude of being, or the thought of the meaning of being as the
finitude of meaning. This formula states: \"the \"essence\" of Dasein
lies in its existence.22 If its essence (in quotation marks) is in its
existence, it is that the existent has no essence. It cannot be returned
to the trans-appropriation of an essence. But it is offered, that is to
say, it is presented to the existence that it is. The existence exposes
being in its essence disappropriated of all essence, and thus of all
\"being:\" the being that is not. Such negativity, however, does not
come dialectically to say that it shall be, that it shall finally be a
trans-appropriated Self. On the contrary, this negation affirms the
inappropriate as its most appropriate form of appropriation, and in
truth as the unique mode of all appropriation. Also, the negative mode
of this utterance: \"being is not\" does not imply a negation but an
ontological affirmation. This is what is meant by Ereignis. [The
existent arrives, takes place, and this is nothing but a being-thrown
into the world]{.underline}. [In this being-thrown, it is
offered]{.underline}. [But it is offered by no one, to no
one]{.underline}. [Nor is it self-sacrificed, if
nothing]{.underline}---no being, no subject---[precedes its
being-thrown]{.underline}. In truth, it is not even offered or
sacrificed to a Nothing, to a Nothingness or an Other in whose abyss it
would come to enjoy its own impossibility of being impossibly. [It is
exactly at this point that]{.underline} both [Bataille]{.underline} and
Heidegger [must be relentlessly corrected]{.underline}. Corrected, that
is: [withdrawn from the slightest tendency towards
sacrifice]{.underline}. [For this tendency towards sacrifice, or through
sacrifice, is always linked to a fascination with an ecstasy turned
towards an Other or towards an absolute Outside, into which the subject
is diverted/spilled the better to be restored]{.underline}. Western
sacrifice is haunted by an Outside of finitude, as obscure and
bottomless as this \"outside\" may be. But there is no \"outside.\" [The
event of existence, the \"there is,\" means that there is nothing
else]{.underline}. There is no \"obscure God.\" There is no obscurity
that would be God. In this sense, and since there is no longer any clear
divine epiphany, I might say that what technique presents us with could
simply be: clarity without God. The clarity, however, of an open space
in which an open eye can no longer be fascinated. Fascination is already
proof that something has been accorded to obscurity and its bloody
heart. But there is nothing to accord, nothing but \"nothing.\"
\"Nothing\" is not an abyss open to the outside. \"Nothing\" affirms
finitude, and this \"nothing\" at once returns existence to itself and
to nothing else. It desubjectivizes it, removing all possibility of
trans-appropriating itself through anything but its own event, advent.
Existence, in this sense, its proper sense, is unsacrificeable. [Thus
there is room to give meaning to the infinite absence of appropriable
meaning]{.underline}. Once again, \"technique\" could well constitute
such an horizon. [That is once more to say, there must be no retreat:
the closure of an immanence]{.underline}. But this immanence would not
have lost or be lacking transcendence. In other words, it would not be
sacrifice in any sense of the word. What we used to call
\"transcendence\" would signify rather that appropriation is immanent,
but that \"[immanence]{.underline}\" [is not some indistinct
coagulation: it is made only from its horizon]{.underline}. [The horizon
holds existence at a distance from itself]{.underline}, [in the gap or
the \"between\" that constitutes it]{.underline}: [between birth and
death, between one and the others]{.underline}. One does not enter the
between, which is also the space of the play of mimesis and of methexis.
Not because it would be an abyss, an altar, or an impenetrable heart,
but because it would be nothing other than the limit of finitude; and
lest we confuse it with, say, Hegelian \"finiteness,\" this limit is a
limit that does not soar above nothingness. Existence alone breaks away
from even itself. [Does this mean rejoicing in a mediocre and limited
life]{.underline}? [Surely such a suspicion could itself come only from
a mediocre and limited life]{.underline}. [And it is this same life that
could suddenly be exalted, fascinated, by sacrifice]{.underline}.
[Neither pain nor death are to be denied]{.underline}. [Still less, if
possible, are these to be sought after in view of some
transappropriation]{.underline}. At issue, rather, is a pain that no
longer sacrifices, and which one no longer sacrifices. True pain,
doubtless, and perhaps even the truest of all. It does not efface joy
(nor enjoyment), and yet, it is not the latter\'s dialectical or
sublimating threshhold either. [There is no threshhold, no sublime and
bloody gesture, that will cross it]{.underline}. After all, Western
sacrifice has almost always known, and almost always been ready to say,
that it sacrificed to nothing. That is why it has always tended to say
that true sacrifice was no longer sacrifice. Yet [henceforth it is
incumbent upon us to say]{.underline}---[after Bataille, with him and
beyond him]{.underline}---that there is no \"true\" sacrifice, that
veritable existence is unsacrificeable, and [that finally the truth of
existence is that it cannot be sacrificed]{.underline}.

#### The aff's disaster means that we can't enage in expenditure 

**Shaviro, 90** (Steven, PhD from Yale, professor at Wayne State
University, former professor at University of Washington, "Passion and
Excess," The Florida State University Press, pg. 37-39)

Yet [if the intensity of Bataille's involvement is clear]{.underline},
the [details of its expression are not.]{.underline} Does the passage
which I have just quoted function as description or as exhortation? On
what sort of threshold are we standing, and what is the nature of the
\"void" which lies beyond it? At such a point, [what kind of
\"alternative" is at stake?]{.underline} What further disaster could be
entailed by a "retreat"? And is it even possible to retreat? Since the
foundations have already crumbled, is not a fall inevitable? But what
sort of courage is available in such a situation? What kind of
\"conquest\" is it which is no longer played out according to the
dialectic of master and slave, with the risk of heroic death as ultimate
stake? What experience of time is realized by this leap into die void?
The only way to answer such questions may be to alter the way in which
they are posed. For the peculiar effect of **[Bataille's
work]{.underline}** is that it **[offers no satisfying
conclusions]{.underline}**, no points of repose. [Not even]{.underline}
the [satisfaction of absolute destruction.]{.underline} His obsessive
meditations concern---a.nd participate in---a catastrophe all the more
obscure and unsettling in that it refuses apocalyptic closure. \"Ce qui
seul demeure est l'agitation circulaire---qui ne s'épuise pas dans
l\`extase et recommence ai partir d'elle \[What alone remains is
circular agitation---which does not exhaust itself in ecstasy and begins
again from it\]\" (OC, 5:130; IE, lll). The \"yertiginous fall'" takes
place in a "bottomless void," and consequently never hits bottom. The
privileged act of [sacrifice]{.underline} serves no end, [leads to no
appeasement.]{.underline} And despite Bataille's frequent sexual
stereotyping and invocations of virility, his \"[interior experience\"
does not culminate in any display of]{.underline} phallic
[mastery.]{.underline} Pure loss, **[expenditure without
recompense]{.underline}**, it **[issues]{.underline}** only in **[an
absurd compulsion to]{.underline}** repeat, to **[approach the threshold
of disaster again and again]{.underline}**. The "summit\" of ecstasy
cannot be extricated from a concomitant \"decline\": \"De méme que le
S0mKIlCt n'est a la fin que l'inacecssible, le déclin des l'abord est
Pinévitable \[Iust as the summit is finally only the inaccessible, so
the decline, from the very first, is inevitable\]" (OC, 6:57). The
[exuberant violence of Bataille's texts is matched only by the pointless
dissipation]{.underline} of the energies [they invoke.]{.underline}

#### Life is a pre-req to death

Nidesh **Lawtoo 5**, Dept of Comparative Lit, U Washington, Bataille and
the Suspension of Being, linguaromana.byu.edu/Lawtoo4.html

Bataille\'s notion of communication involves a dialectic with two
positives (hence a non-dialectic) where two sovereigns confront death
not in view of an end but as an end in itself: \"[confronting
death]{.underline},\" in fact, \"[puts the subjects at
stake]{.underline}-\"l\'être en eux-mêmes \[est\] mis en jeu\" (Sur
Nietzsche 61). Further, [Bataille affirms]{.underline} that
\"\[p\]ersonne n\'est-un instant-souverain qui ne se perde\" (OC VIII
429). It is the Nietzschean self-forgetfulness that is here evoked; [a
self-forgetfulness which implies a transgression of the limits
of]{.underline} [both]{.underline} [communicating subjects]{.underline}.
Again, for Bataille \"\[l\]a \'communication\' n\'a lieu qu\'entre deux
êtres mis en jeu-déchirés, suspendus, l\'un et l\'autre penchés
au-dessus de leur néant\" (Sur Nietzsche 62). [However, if according to
Nietzsche, self-forgetfulness takes place in solitude, for Bataille it
**necessitates the presence of an \"other**.\"(]{.underline}5)
Communication in fact, asks for \"deux êtres mis en jeu\" who
participate in what he defines as \"une fête immotivée\" (Sur Nietzsche
31). There [the sovereign loses himself]{.underline} (se perde) [with
the other, through the other, in the other, in a process of \"mutual
laceration]{.underline}\" (Essential 105) which is simultaneously tragic
and ludic. The emphasis on the other is Hegelian, but unlike dialectics,
communication does not confront the subject with an object (Gegen-stand,
something that stands against the subject). As Bataille puts it
(apparently echoing Baudelaire), communication takes place with \"un
semblable,\" \"mon frère\" (OC VIII 289). And he adds: \"Cela suppose la
communication de sujet à sujet\" (OC VIII 288). [Bataille\'s notion of
communication is not based upon a \"violent hierarchy]{.underline}\"
(Derrida\'s term) [but rather upon egalitarianism]{.underline}.
Moreover, [transgressing the limits of the subject implies that the two
subjects already possess]{.underline} (in potential) [the
characteristics of sovereignty]{.underline}. Hence, **[the status of
sovereign is not achieved as a result of a fight to the death, but
requires the subject to be open to an other who is outside the limits of
the self]{.underline}**. Derrida speaks of the \"trembling\" to which
Bataille submits Hegelian concepts (253). This trembling, I would argue,
has its source in Nietzsche (6): \"The figs fall from the trees\" says
Zarathustra, \"they are good and sweet, and when they fall, their red
skins are rent. A north wind am I unto ripe figs\" (qtd. in Philosophy
135). If we apply this passage to Bataille\'s philosophy, we could say
that inherent in this \"fall\" is an explosion of Hegelian concepts, and
in particular, as we have seen, the notion of Herrshaft. Further,
communication, for Bataille, involves a similar \"fall\" which rents
(déchire) the skin of the subjects (their limits) exposing the red flesh
which lies beneath the skin. According to the French philosopher,
Nietzsche\'s critique of the subject is more radical than Hegel\'s,
since, as he puts it in \"Hegel, la mort et le sacrifice,\" Hegel\'s
philosophy, and I would add Kojève\'s interpretation of it, is \"une
théologie, où l\'homme aurait pris la place de Dieu\" (OC XII 329).
Hegel\'s \"theology\" preserves the identity of the subject. Now,
Bataille makes his position to this \"theology\" clear as he writes: \"I
don\'t believe in God-from the inability to believe in self\" (Essential
10). By establishing a direct link between the death of the subject and
the death of God, Bataille extends his critique of \"beings\" into the
larger, ontological, critique of \"Being.\" Implicit in this theoretical
move is the articulation of the ontology of sovereignty. Bataille\'s
philosophy is Nietzschean insofar as it is grounded in experience and in
the immanence of the body. Communication, for Bataille is first and
foremost a bodily affair. Hence the interrogation of the limits of the
subject starts from an interrogation of what we could call the
\"gates,\" or openings of the body: the mouth, the vagina, the anus and
the eyes are for Bataille central places for philosophical investigation
because at these gates, the integrity of the subject is questioned; its
limits can be transgressed. They are spaces of transition where a
\"glissement hors de soi\" (OC VIII 246) can take place. These bodily
openings, which Bataille also defines as \"blessures,\" (Sur Nietzsche
64) found his conception of the sovereign subject. In fact, each
\"blessure\" can be linked to a specific dimension of communication
which obsesses Bataille. His central themes match different bodily
openings: the mouth connects to laughter; the vagina to eroticism; the
eyes to tears; the anus to the excrements which he links to death.
Through these openings the subject is traversed by different fluxes and
its integrity, totality and stability is challenged. They allow for the
possibility of a glissement of the subject\'s being. The same could be
said of Bataille\'s corpus: it is a unitary entity, which, like a body,
escapes the totalizing temptation of closure. Despite the fact that
Bataille defines sovereignty in terms of the Kojèvian/Hegelian
\"nothingness\" (Bataille\'s Rien), his conception of communication is
built upon the Nietzschean ontological distinction between the Dionysian
and the Apollonian. In fact, the ontological movement that takes place
in communication \"exige que l\'on glisse\" (OC VI 158) from an
\"insufficient\" and \"discontinuous\" being to a reality of
\"continuity\" that transcends binary oppositions (Erotism 13-14). To
put it more simply, communication introduces a movement from the
\"many\" to the \"One\"; from a \"discontinuity of being\" to a
\"continuity of being;\" from separate \"beings\" to a common
ontological ground (\"Being\"). The source of Bataille\'s ontology is
clear: it stems from Nietzsche\'s The Birth of Tragedy which in turn, is
construed upon Schopenhauer\'s distinction between will and
representation. \"As a sailor sits in a small boat in a boundless raging
sea,\" writes Schopenhauer,\" surrounded on all sides by heaving
mountainous waves, trusting to his frail vessel; so does the individual
man sit calmly in the middle of a world of torment, trusting to the
principium individuationis\" (Birth 21) .(7)
[Communication]{.underline}, for Bataille, as the Dionysian for
Nietzsche, [involves]{.underline} the shattering of the principium
individuationis, a [tearing down]{.underline} of [the veil]{.underline}
of Maya [which constitutes]{.underline}, what Bataille calls, with a
blink of the eye to Schopenhauer, [the \"illusion of a being which is
isolated]{.underline}\" (Essential 10; my emphasis). [Communication,
thus, involves an opening of the subject to the larger ground of Being.
The sovereign\'s boat is constantly leaking. Yet, in order for
communication to take place, the boat needs to keep
floating]{.underline}. That is to say that **[for transgression to take
place, the limits of the subject need to be preserved]{.underline}**
(Erotism 63; Foucault 34). [The being of the sovereign subject is
suspended]{.underline} upon the abîme-what Bataille also calls \"une
realité plus vaste\" (OC II 246)-which means that [the subject neither
dwells safely within the limits of the \"small, insufficient boat\" of
individuation, nor within the depth of the undifferentiated \"raging
sea,\" but in the space of contact in-between the two
spheres]{.underline}. [This precision is key in order to
delineate]{.underline} the originality of [Bataille\'s ontology of
sovereignty. Bataille\'s conception of the communicating subject (i.e.,
of sovereignty) walks a thin line between its self-dissolution and its
self-preservation]{.underline}. **[Hence the idea that he is above all a
thinker of limits]{.underline}** or borders. [The sovereign\'s
being]{.underline}, in fact, [is \"suspended]{.underline}\" on the
\"bord de l\'abîme\" (Coupable V 355) **[but never actually
falls]{.underline}**, except, of course, in death. Hence, for Bataille,
\"\[i\]l s\'agit d\'approcher la mort\" \[it is
[approaching]{.underline} [death]{.underline}\] that is to say, the
abîme, or the continuity of being, \"d\'aussi près qu\'on peut
l\'endurer\" \[[as close as one can endure]{.underline}\] (337-338).
[The sovereign subject **confronts death while preserving his
life.**]{.underline} His [being is placed at the border between life and
death]{.underline}. Hence, [if Bataille defines philosophy as
\"existence striving to reach its limits]{.underline}\" (Essential 146),
[it should be specified that the being of the subject is not found
beyond its limits]{.underline}, as his use [of
\"existence]{.underline}\" seems to suggest (Ek-sistenz) [since that
would imply a total dissolution of the subject]{.underline}. Bataille\'s
philosophy of [transgression implies the **preservation of the limits of
the subject so that the sovereign can experience and endure death in
life**]{.underline}. [The tension between self-expenditure]{.underline}
(Nietzsche\'s Verschwendung) [and self-preservation]{.underline} (linked
to Hegel\'s Anerkennung) [is analogous to the movement of a moth that is
first attracted by the fire of a candle and subsequently distances
itself from the fire in order to preserve its life.]{.underline}(8)
[This repeated back and forth movement recapitulates the movement of
communication and is responsible for the underlying tension which
traverses Bataille\'s philosophy. It is an inner (bodily) drive that
attracts the moth to death]{.underline} and not, as it is the case for
Hegel\'s master, a reasoned project in view of an end (recognition). The
moth\'s self-sacrifice, in fact, is perfectly useless (it serves no
purpose) and hence is truly sovereign. Bataille would call it \"une
négativité sans emploi.\" Or, as he says with respect to eroticism in
his first and last interview before he died, \"it is purely squandering,
an expenditure of energy for itself\" (in Essential 220). [This movement
forwards, towards the flame of self-dissolution]{.underline} (which
takes place in death, eroticism, laughter...) [and its retreat
backwards, towards life and the limits it involves, epitomizes
Bataille\'s notion of communication.]{.underline} A practice which for
Bataille seems to have the characteristic of a fort-da game in which the
subject is not in control of the movement. This movement, Bataille
writes in the Preface to Madame Edwarda, happens \"malgré nous\" (III
11). Thus conceived the sovereign accepts the place of a toy in the
hands of a child playing-a definition similar to Heraclitus\' vision of
life, which he defines as \"a child at play, moving pieces in a game
(Fragment 52, in GM 149). This view of communication is both tragic and
joyful; violent and useless. A joyful tragedy, which challenges the
limits of the subject; that puts the subject\'s being en jeu. [If
Bataille is deeply fascinated by death, decay and the dissolution of the
subject in a continuity of being, **he escapes the temptation to embrace
death at the expense of life**.]{.underline} [His definition of
eroticism sums up this fundamental tension: \"Eroticism,\" he writes,
\"is assenting to life up to the point of death\"]{.underline}
(Erotism11). [This applies]{.underline} not only to eroticism but also
[to all]{.underline} communicating [activities]{.underline} such as
laughter, play, tears, and ultimately to the ethos [that sustains the
totality of Bataille\'s philosophy]{.underline}. If Kojève defines
dialectics as a \"negating-negativity\" (5), [Bataille\'s communication
can be read as an affirmative negativity.]{.underline} In fact, [death
is confronted and even invoked**, but what is found in death is the
ultimate affirmation of life.**]{.underline} [Negation of the integrity
(the limits) of the subject leads to a **radical affirmation of
life**.]{.underline} And if in the Preface to Madame Edwarda, Bataille
can affirme \"l\'identité de l\'être et de la mort\" (OC III 10), let us
also note that **[the identity of being and death is realized in
life.]{.underline}** Faithful to Nietzsche, [Bataille does not become a
negator of the will; a negator of life; a pessimist]{.underline}, a
Buddhist [or worse, a nihilist]{.underline} (some of the derogatory
terms used by Nietzsche to retrospectively define his first and last
master). **[Bataille remains truthful to life]{.underline}**. While the
ontological premises grounding sovereignty are taken from Schopenhauer
(via Nietzsche), Bataille\'s conclusions are diametrically opposed to
Nietzsche\'s first master. In fact, [Bataille\'s philosophy can be seen
as an affirmation of the will]{.underline} (he operates an inversion of
values) [through Dionysian practices]{.underline} (included sexuality
which Schopenhauer condemned) [that put the subject in touch with the
ultimate ground of being, **without dissolving him/her in
it**]{.underline}.
