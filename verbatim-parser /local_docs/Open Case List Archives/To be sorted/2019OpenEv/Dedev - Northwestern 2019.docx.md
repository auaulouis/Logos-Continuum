3\. ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS: THE LIMITS OF GREEN GROWTH¶ Although driven by
political, institutional, and discursive processes, [growth
is]{.underline} also **[biophysical]{.underline}**. [The economic
process converts energy, resources, and matter to goods, services, and
**waste**]{.underline} (34). In theory, [it seems possible to decouple
material throughput from economic output by improving the resource
efficiency of production.]{.underline} Ecological economists, however,
argue that in practice [**[absolute decoupling is unlikely]{.mark}**,
[even though]{.mark} [relative decoupling is]{.mark} common]{.underline}
(34). **[[Efficiency should not be confused with
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** (35): [[The more efficiently we use]{.mark}
resources, the lower they cost, and **[the more]{.mark} of them [we end
up using]{.mark}**]{.underline} (36). [This is, in essence,
growth.]{.underline} [Just as increases in labor productivity lead to
growth and new jobs,]{.underline} not to less employment, [increases in
resource productivity increase output and **resource use**]{.underline}
(37). Capitalist economies grow by using more resources and more people,
more intensively. [Accelerating this is unlikely to spare resources.¶
[Growth can become "cleaner"]{.mark} or "greener" by
substituting]{.underline}, for example, [fossil fuels with solar power,
or scarce, environmentally intensive metals with more abundant and less
intensive metals]{.underline}. [[But new substitutes have resource
requirements]{.mark}, and life-cycle impacts that cross space and
time]{.underline}. Energy is a vital source of useful work (38); growth
has been possible because fossil fuels did things human labor alone
could not do. Ending the use of fossil fuels is likely to reduce labor
productivity and limit output (34). [[Solar and wind]{.mark} power
[are]{.mark} constrained only by their rate of flow]{.underline}, but
unlike fossil fuels, [they are **[diffuse]{.mark}**]{.underline}---more
like rain than a lake (3). [To collect and concentrate a diffuse flow of
energy, **[more energy is necessary and more land is
required]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The EROIs]{.underline} (energy returns
on energy investment) [of renewable energies are between 10:1 and 20:1,
compared to more than 50:1 for]{.underline} earlier deposits of [oil and
coal]{.underline} (39). [An economy powered by a diffuse energy flow is
then likely to be an economy of lower net energy and lower output than
one powered by concentrated stocks]{.underline} (3). [[Land]{.mark} use
[for solar or wind]{.mark} also [competes with]{.mark} the use of [land
for **food**]{.mark} **production**]{.underline}, [[and **rare
materials** are necessary]{.mark} for infrastructures and
batteries]{.underline} that store their intermittent flows, **[[with
significant environmental effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶ [Historical
data corroborate ecological economic theory]{.underline} (40). Ayres &
Warr (38) find that the [use of net energy after conversion losses
explains a big portion of the **U**nited **S**tates' total factor
productivity and economic growth]{.underline}. [At the global level,
[GDP and material use have increased]{.mark} approximately
[1:1]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Carbon emissions have increased somewhat
slower than GDP, but still have **increased**]{.underline} (34). **[This
is unlikely to be a coincidence]{.underline}**. Exceptions may exist,
but cross-panel data analysis shows that overall, 1% growth of a
national economy is associated with 0.6% to 0.8% increase in its carbon
emissions (41) and 0.8% growth in its resource use (42). ¶ [Global
[resource use follows]{.mark} currently [the "**collapse by
2050**"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} foreseen in
the "Limits to Growth" 1971 report (43--45). [Domestic material use in
some developed]{.underline} OECD [economies has reached a plateau, but
this is because of globalization and trade]{.underline}. [[If we take
into account **imported goods**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [then the
[material requirements of products]{.mark} and services [consumed in
OECD countries have grown]{.mark} hand in hand with GDP, [with **no
decoupling**]{.mark}]{.underline} (46). [For **[water use]{.mark}**, the
[effects]{.mark} of growth [overwhelm]{.mark} any realistic
[savings]{.mark} from technologies and efficiency]{.underline} (47);
[water footprints have increased]{.underline} even in regions such as
California where water withdrawals were stabilized (40). ¶ [[Carbon
emissions in some]{.underline}]{.mark} EU (European Union) [[countries
have been declining]{.mark},]{.underline} even after trade is taken into
account, suggesting some substitution of fossil fuels by cleaner
energies. \[Although recession also played a role (34).\]
[[These]{.mark} declines [are nowhere near]{.mark} the 8--[10%,
year]{.mark}-after-year [reductions]{.mark}]{.underline} in carbon
emissions [[required for]{.mark} developed nations under scenarios
compatible with [a **50% chance** of limiting warming to
2◦]{.mark}C]{.underline} (48). [[Further reductions will be harder to
sustain once **one-off substitutions**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [oil or [coal with]{.mark} natural [gas are
exhausted]{.mark}]{.underline} (34). ¶ [Resource use or carbon emissions
are a product of the scale of the economy]{.underline} (GDP) times its
resource or carbon intensity (kg/GDP or kgCO2/GDP). With 1.5% annual
increase in global income per capita, carbon intensity has to decline
4.4% each year for staying within 2◦C; with 0% growth, carbon intensity
has to fall 2.9% each year (49). In the period 1970--2013, the average
annual reduction rate for carbon intensity was less than 1.5%---and this
gets harder to sustain as the share of carbon-intensive economies in
global output increases (49). As Jackson (50) showed in his seminal
work, **[[it is]{.mark} practically [impossible to envisage]{.mark}
viable [climate mitigation scenarios that involve
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This calls for]{.underline} research on
[managing]{.underline}, or prospering, **[without growth]{.underline}**
(50, 51). ¶ [Some [scenarios]{.mark} deem possible meeting climate
targets while sustaining growth, but these generally [assume after
2050]{.mark} some sort of ["negative emissions technology]{.mark},"
geo-engineering or otherwise.]{.underline} According to a recent Nature
editorial, [[these]{.mark} technologies [remain]{.mark} currently
"**[magical thinking]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (52). [[Clean
energy]{.mark} investments can stimulate the economy in the short run,
but [in the **long run**]{.mark}]{.underline} [growth [may be limited
by]{.mark} their **[low EROIs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Studies suggest
that economic growth requires a minimum EROI of close to 11:1 (53). Less
EROI means less labor productivity, and hence less growth. Indeed,
"Limits to Growth" scenarios do not predict growth ending when resources
are exhausted but, rather, when the quality of resources declines to
such an extent that further extraction diverts more and more investment
away from productive industry (44).¶ Degrowth is defined by ecological
economists as an equitable downscaling of throughput, with a concomitant
securing of wellbeing. If there is a fundamental coupling of economic
activity and resource use, as ecological economics suggests there is,
then serious environmental or climate policies will slow down the
economy. Vice versa, a slower economy will use less resources and emit
less carbon (40). This is not the same as saying that the degrowth goal
is to reduce GDP (54); slowing down the economy is not an end but a
likely outcome in a transition toward equitable wellbeing and
environmental sustainability. ¶ Advancing a position of "a-growth," van
den Bergh (54) proposes ignoring GDP and implementing a global carbon
price, indifferent to what its effect on growth turns out to be.
Ignoring GDP is a normative position---but at the end, the economy will
either grow or not, and if it does not, then there should be plans for
managing without growth. Given how entrenched GDP growth is in existing
institutional and political structures, a-growth approaches must be
advanced as part of broader systemic change (55).¶ Is it possible to
secure a decent standard of living for all while throughput and output
degrow? [Substantive evidence indicates that **[prosperity does not
depend on]{.mark} high levels of [production]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
consumption]{.underline}. Kubiszewski et al. (56) find that the Genuine
Progress Indicator, an indicator that includes environmental and social
costs alongside output, peaked in 1978, despite subsequent global
growth. A similar indicator, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare,
has stayed at the same levels in the United States since 1950, despite a
threefold growth of GDP (57). ¶ Wealthier countries on average have
higher levels of life expectancy and education than poorer ones, but
[above a certain level of GDP, income does not make a difference in
wellbeing]{.underline}---**[equality]{.underline}** [does]{.underline}.
[Satisfactory levels of wellbeing are achieved by countries such as
Vietnam or Costa Rica at a fraction]{.underline} (one-third or less) [of
the output, energy, or resource use of]{.underline} countries such as
[the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Even the lower levels of
resource use of mid-income countries, however, would not be sustainable
if they were to be generalized to the planet as a whole. No country
currently satisfies social wellbeing standards while staying within its
share of planetary boundaries, suggesting that radical changes in
provisioning systems are necessary (58). ¶ Wealthier people within a
country are on average happier than others, but [in the long run,
overall happiness does not increase as a country's income
rises]{.underline} (59). Nuances of this income-happiness paradox depend
on the sample of countries included and how one defines and asks about
happiness. Within societies, individuals with higher incomes evaluate
their lives as better than others, but do not enjoy better emotional
wellbeing (60). Income determines social rank, and rank affects
individuals' assessments of their lives. [Growth does not change
relative rank or relative access to positional goods]{.underline} (those
signifying position) [but it does inflate expectations and prices of
material goods, **increasing frustration**]{.underline} (61). Relative
comparisons matter for personal wellbeing in low-income and high-income
countries; for both, the more equally income is distributed, the happier
people are (62). [**[Pro-environmental behaviors]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and sharing [are]{.mark} also [strongly associated with personal
wellbeing]{.mark}]{.underline} (63). [This suggests that [an economic
contraction may not impact wellbeing negatively]{.mark}]{.underline} if
accompanied by redistribution, sharing, and value shifts (34).

### Growth Hurts Environment

#### Degrowth is the only way to avoid [invisible thresholds]{.underline} that cause extinction

Exploring Pathways to Genuine Sustainable Development," *Journal of

Nature has its own set of rules, solidly grounded in laws of physics and
chemistry, and emergent principles of geology and biology, which are not
artificial constructs. The natural rules are real, and they govern human
well-being. Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes,
tornadoes, floods, droughts, famines, civil conflicts, wildfires,
poverty, and disease epidemics demonstrate dramatically that our planet
Earth is at risk. Moreover, the outbreak of novel diseases, such as
Ebola and AIDS, in socially, economically, and ecologically impoverished
regions is a clear signal of the global predicaments of inequality and
poverty. These [natural and anthropogenic [disasters
are]{.mark}]{.underline} clear [[indicators of **ecological
overshoot**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [meaning anthropogenic [disturbances
beyond]{.mark} the **[carrying capacity]{.mark} of
ecosystems**]{.underline} [that [lead to **ecological
crash**]{.mark}]{.underline}, causing an eventual die-off, hence
environmental disasters \[3\]. The frequency, scale, and adverse effects
of these challenges must be of great concern to humanity.¶ "[[Human
alteration]{.mark} of the Earth]{.underline} was substantial and
growing, [[transform]{.underline}]{.mark}ing between one-third and
**[[one-half of]{.mark} the [global land surface]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increased by nearly 30% since the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution; [[more]{.mark} atmospheric
[nitrogen was fixed by humanity than]{.mark} by [all natural]{.mark}
terrestrial [sources]{.mark} combined]{.underline}; [[humanity
consumed]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[half of
all]{.underline}]{.mark} accessible
surface-**[[freshwater]{.underline}]{.mark}**; and about [one-quarter of
the **bird species on Earth**]{.underline} [were driven to
extinction]{.underline}" \[4\]. The UN's Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
\[5\], a global landmark study, which involved more than 1,360
scientists, technical experts, and policy makers from around the globe,
summarized its findings as follows (paraphrased): (i) although living
standards of "the few" have improved over the past two centuries, [human
activity is putting]{.underline} such [strain on nature]{.underline},
[undermining the Earth's capacity to support current and future
generations]{.underline}; (ii) [we are living beyond our
means]{.underline}: the current gains in enhanced quality of life have
come at a considerable cost to health and integrity of ecosystems on
which human well-being depends; (iii) [**[if we act now]{.underline}**,
[we can avoid **irreversible damage**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
ecosystems and to our well-being]{.underline}; and (iv) we can no longer
treat Nature's bounty as free and limitless.¶ The information summarized
in Table 1(Ecological Foundations section below) makes it all clear that
human well-being depends on the life sustaining multiple services of
ecosystems. Furthermore, a team of renowned scientists from N. America,
Europe, Australia and the Scandinavian countries identified the
following nine ecological thresholds, which define "the safe operating
space for humanity": (i) climate change, (ii) rate of terrestrial and
marine biodiversity loss, (iii) human interference with the natural
cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, (iv) stratospheric ozone depletion,
(v) ocean acidification, (vi) global freshwater consumption rate, (vii)
land-use-change, (viii) chemical pollution, and (ix) atmospheric aerosol
loading. The team concluded that [[humanity was approaching]{.mark} to
the [boundaries for freshwater]{.mark} consumption,
[land-use]{.mark}-change, [ocean acidification]{.mark}, and]{.underline}
interference with [the global [phosphorus]{.mark} cycle]{.underline},
[[while]{.mark} the [boundaries for **climate change**]{.mark},
**[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss]{.mark}**, and interference with [the
**nitrogen cycle** **have**]{.mark} **already [been
transgressed]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[6\]. An urgent call for an
anthropogenic balancing act not to transgress ecological thresholds is
in order. Halting short-sighted excessive anthropocentric activities
that lead to overexploitation of natural resources is imperative. The
naturally imposed limiting frontiers, the ecological thresholds, must be
respected and protected. ¶ Rooted in the doctrine of laissez-faire,
neoliberalism promotes perpetual [economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}
(PEG), which means unfettered expansion of an economy's productive
capacity realized through enabling institutional arrangements. But, PEG
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} inherently **[[not compatible with ecological
integrity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [environmental quality,
and]{.underline} genuine [sustainable development]{.underline} (GSD).
Drawing on the findings , conclusions, and recommendations of
Rockström's team \[6\], I define GSD as a dynamic process by which human
well-being is improved in an inclusive, a just, and an environmentally
safe operating space, achieved through inventions, innovations,
diffusion, and adoption of appropriate technologies as well as
learning-by-doing.¶ GSD is in a stark contrast with the highly
publicized and politicized concept of sustainable development (SD) of
the UN's Brundtland Commission, which is also known as World Commission
on Environment and Development (WCED) (1987) \[7\]. The highly
generalized and vague definition of SD is: "Sustainable development is
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains
within it two key concepts: (1) the concept of "needs", in particular
the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overwhelming priority
should be given; and (2) the idea of limitations imposed by the state of
technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet
present and future needs". Our Common Future, p.143.¶ Given all its good
intentions, the WECD failed to explain the consequences of PEG strongly.
Unfortunately, SD's exact definition continues to be globally
politicized and linked always to strategic policy goals and objectives
one would like to talk about. SD does not give any specific guidelines
pertinent to alleviation of the human predicaments associated with
inequality, poverty, perversely globalized markets, destruction of the
health and integrity of ecosystems, and climate change.¶ Research
questions, goal, and organization of the paper¶ What are the theoretical
and practical foundations of the PEG doctrine? Are PEG and GSD
compatible? Addressing these questions has become a persistent challenge
to both social and natural scientists. The overarching goal of this
article is to demonstrate the incompatibility of PEG with GSD.¶ Rooted
in neoclassical microeconomic theory, neoliberalism advocates for PEG,
which is unfettered expansion of an economy's productive capacity in the
finite, materially closed (except the constant inflow of solar energy),
and non-growing biosphere \[8\]. For this doctrine to be realized,
neoliberal economists prescribe globalized perfectly competitive
markets, where multinational corporations play the dominant economic
games against all policies and strategic practices of GSD.¶ Let me be
clear at the outset. As a trained economist, who went through the
grueling processes of acquiring a PhD, I understand the importance of
all the fundamentals of microeconomic and macroeconomic theories. My
argument is against the misuse and, in some case, abuse of these
scientific theories to promote personal ideological perceptions. I am
motivated to add my "voice" to those voices of many preeminent scholars,
whose extensively published works inspired me to learn more on the
adverse effects of neoliberalism on ecological integrity and human
well-being \[6, 8-12\].¶ The paper is organized into six sections: this
introduction, ecological foundations for GSD, the fallacies of the PEG
doctrine, anthropogenic effects on ecological integrity, selected
pathways to GSD, and concluding remarks and policy recommendations, in
that order.¶ Ecological Foundations of Genuine Sustainable Development¶
In this section, I summarize the ecological foundations of GSD, using
taxonomy of the following key scientific terms: ecological principles of
holism, biodiversity loss, sustainability, resilience, ecological
integrity, biogeochemical processes, carrying capacity, and overshoot.¶
Principles of holism¶ Ecological principles of holism mean that
everything is interconnected with everything. This can be summarized by
the dictum: "A whole is more than the sum of its parts or members". The
totality of the whole of any living system-biological, social, or
economic-is not fully embodied in its individual parts or members.
Wholes have properties that are not present in any of their separate
parts; they emerge only when the parts are combined together, forming
mutually reinforcing synergistic nexus, in a coherent whole; and the
specific properties of individual parts disappear when they are part of
the whole.¶ Thus, relationships among the parts of wholes matter; when
relationships change, the whole is changed. For example, [water, air,
and soil are polluted with chemical and biological waste]{.underline},
because we humans fail to appreciate the importance of their holistic
relationship with Nature and thereby with our well-being. Respiratory
problems, cancer, food poisoning, and general poor health as well as the
cost of healthcare are some of the consequences of ignoring the
imperatives of holism.¶ Government policies that influence agriculture,
forestry, mining, manufacturing, labor relations, capital investments,
employment, economic growth, all have direct and indirect impacts on the
natural environment-locally, nationally, and globally. [[We have **no
way of knowing** how large]{.mark} or small [our]{.mark} individual or
collective [adverse effects may be]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
understanding the ecological principles of holism is necessary condition
to preserve ecological integrity and foster human well-being.¶
Consequences of biodiversity loss¶ Biodiversity (i.e., biological
diversity) is the number, variety and variability of genes, populations,
species, communities, ecosystems, and ecological processes.
[Biodiversity underpins the multiple services of ecosystems that sustain
human well-being; is the foundation of resilience of life]{.underline}
on Earth; and an integral part of the fabric of all the world's
cultures. It is a common knowledge of the science of ecology that no
feature of Earth is more complex, dynamic, and varied than the layer of
organisms that occupy its surfaces and its seas; and [no feature is
experiencing more dramatic changes at the hands of humans
than]{.underline} this extraordinary, singularly unique and beautiful
feature of the Earth, [biodiversity]{.underline}. **[[Critical
ecological processes]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., ecosystem functions)
[[that depend on prevailing]{.mark} scale of
[biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline} at the ecosystem level [[influence
plant productivity, soil]{.mark} fertility, water quality, atmospheric
[chemistry, and many other]{.mark} local and global environmental
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} that ultimately affect human welfare.¶
Substantial changes have already occurred, especially local and global
losses of biodiversity. The primary cause has been widespread human
transformation of once highly diverse natural ecosystems into relatively
species-poor managed ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that such
[reductions in biodiversity can alter both the magnitude and the
stability of ecosystem processes]{.underline}, especially when
biodiversity is reduced to the low levels typical of many managed
natural systems. We humans ought to remind ourselves that barren deserts
are capable of supporting very little life (if any), because they lack
biological diversity. [[Ecosystems that]{.mark} completely [lack
diversity have **no**]{.mark} **high quality, low entropy,
[energy]{.mark} left to [support life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶
[Diversity enables living systems to adapt and evolve]{.underline} to
accommodate their ever-changing natural environment. Even if we do not
understand fully the specific nature of a threat, it should be clear
that loss of biodiversity represents a growing threat to the future of
human life on Earth. [[There is **no way of knowing** how many]{.mark}
more [species can be lost before the]{.mark} **ecological [balance is
tipped toward extinction]{.mark} of all species**]{.underline}.

### Transition

#### Decline causes transition\-\--crisis fundamentally changes entrenched models of growth and empowers calls for degrowth

Derk **Loorbach 16**, director of DRIFT and Professor of Socio-economic
Transitions at the Faculty of Social Science, both at Erasmus University
Rotterdam, "The economic crisis as a game changer? Exploring the role of
social construction in sustainability transitions," *Ecology and
Society*, Volume 21, Issue 4, 2016,
http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol21/iss4/art15/

Meanwhile, many political and public debates seem to be primarily
concerned with standard, relatively short-term, economic issues, such as
monetary losses, stop-and-start economic growth, increasing
unemployment, falling real estate prices, failing banks, virtually
bankrupt nations, and how to get back on course to economic growth. The
standard responses when national governments are struggling to get their
economies healthy again are mostly about inducing more money, austerity
measures, and introducing financial regulations, all often part of a
broader financial--economic logic (Stiglitz 2010). [The dominant [focus
on fighting]{.mark} economic [deficits]{.mark} and problems at the
expense of investing in social and **ecological**
deficits]{.underline}---[thereby [fail]{.mark}ing to address persistent
problems in these areas]{.underline}---[can be argued to be a
**short-term strategy**]{.underline} [to [prop up an]{.mark} inherently
**[unmanageable system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Examples are the support
of system banks with public money and the green growth strategy (OECD
2009, 2013a). Transition theory (Grin et al. 2010, Markard et al. 2012)
suggests that such short-term fixes are typical regime-based strategies
to sustain existing structures, cultures, and practices, and to fend off
the threats of more radical systemic change.¶ The transition perspective
suggests that most regular policy and governance strategies essentially
reproduce existing systems and, by definition, do not address the root
causes of problems that are embedded in the same structures and cultures
that determine how solutions are framed and implemented. Such
[[path-dependent development]{.mark} optimizing existing institutional
structures [will]{.mark} inevitably [lead to **recurring
crises**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} ultimately [a **more
disruptive**, shock]{.mark}-wise **[structural change]{.mark}** of an
incumbent regime]{.underline}. Transition studies thus argue that
[solutions that address symptoms rather than the underlying structural
causes tend to reinforce a lock-in and result in further emergent
problems]{.underline} (Rotmans and Loorbach 2010, Schuitmaker 2012). We
argue that the underlying causes and mechanisms of the economic crises
have not been thoroughly analyzed, let alone addressed through effective
policies. In a globalized economy, fundamental changes will not likely
come from actions by (national) governments or incumbent businesses, as
these are inherently intertwined with and dependent upon the currently
still dominant financial--economic systems and their governance. The
need for alternative economic approaches, discourses, and systems is
increasingly emphasized (Schor 2010, Simms 2013, Jackson 2013, van den
Bergh 2013, Schor and Thompson, 2014). Even though the benefits of
liberalization are still significant, it seems that the transfer of
control from government to markets has substantially diminished
possibilities for top-down policy making, adding to brittleness,
complexity, and lock-in (Loorbach and Lijnis-Huffenreuter 2013).¶ In
this paper, we take a transition perspective on transformative social
innovation to conceptualize and map the systemic dynamics that have
caused the economic crisis, as well as how it influences the dynamics of
social transformation. We explore how [the economic [crisis might
be]{.mark} considered as [a phase in]{.mark} a **[broader]{.mark}
economic [transition]{.mark}**]{.underline} and which types of changes
coincide to develop into this direction. We thus [[view]{.mark} the
economic [crisis not]{.mark} as a phenomenon [in isolation]{.mark}
within a relatively short time frame, [but as]{.mark} an intrinsic
[part]{.mark}, or perhaps a symptom, [of **deeper underlying
structural**]{.mark} **societal [changes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [over
the longer term.]{.underline} The question we seek to address is how the
economic crisis interacts with broader societal changes as well as which
dynamics might accelerate or hamper more structural (sustainability)
transitions. To this end, [we ask when and how a macrolevel or landscape
development like the economic [crisis **fundamentally changes** the
**dominant logic**]{.mark}, rules, and conditions [of **incumbent
regimes**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, when does a
macrodevelopment become a game changer (cf. Avelino et al. 2014)?¶ The
paper builds upon theoretical work from the European FP7 project
TRANSIT, which draws on transition theory to develop an empirically
grounded theory on transformative social innovation. In this paper, we
introduce the analytical perspective that we developed on transformative
social innovation and two empirical examples. Although our analytical
perspective suggests that alternatives and breakthroughs can come from
any sector or actor, in this paper, we focus on the agency of social
innovation and civil-society-led initiatives in providing and producing
alternatives. The paper was developed through a number of iterations,
workshops, and theoretical synthesizing. To develop our arguments, we
build upon insights from sustainability transitions literature (Grin et
al. 2010, Markard et al. 2012), social innovation research (Mulgan 2006,
Murray et al. 2010, Franz et al. 2012, Westley 2013, Moulaert et al.
2013) and other fields aiming to understand the economic crisis. In
addition, we include two empirical cases, transnational networks of
social innovation, time banks, and the transition movement. For both
cases, we draw upon a general literature review.¶ The paper is
structured as follows. In the next section, "Economic change or
transition?," we introduce the economic crisis as a multifarious
phenomenon, how we understand it from a transition perspective, and how
it is understood from an economist's point of view. We illustrate that
it is an ambiguous phenomenon that is simultaneously seen as part of
regular changes in that it is part of disruptive or transformative
change. In the section "Making sense of the economic crisis?," we
present a number of alternative perspectives on the economic crisis that
put forward particular fundamental and systemic causes of the economic
crisis and how these are translated in so called "narratives of change."
In "Transformative social innovations," we highlight two specific social
innovation initiatives, time banks and transition towns, which have an
evident transformative claim and potential, and reflect upon how such
transformative social innovations relate (themselves) to the economic
crisis. In "Reconceptualizing societal transformations and the role of
the economic crisis," we synthesize our findings and argue that the
concepts of game changers and narratives could help to unpack the
landscape and better understand how macro- and microlevels interact to
trigger transformative changes at the mesolevel. In conclusion, we
address the need for a better understanding of the transformative
impacts of the different shades of change (in coevolution) vis-é-vis the
restorative dynamics associated with incumbent regimes.¶ ECONOMIC CHANGE
OR TRANSITION?¶ The economic crisis has an empirical basis in factual
events and economic statistics, but is also a social construct. In a
narrow sense, the term economic crisis refers to [the worldwide
recession of 2007--[2008]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[changed]{.mark}
economic circumstances and investors' [outlooks and]{.mark} caused
governments to nationalize and/or invest in failing banks and to
stimulate the economy inter alia through bail outs, expansion of the
money supply]{.underline} (quantitative easing), [and low interest
rates. It changed the [lives of many whose]{.mark} employment or work
[conditions were]{.mark} **drastically [affected]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Melike 2014). [[It]{.mark} also [made many]{.mark} observers much
**[more critical]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[about capitalism and
the stability [of markets]{.mark}, especially financial
markets]{.underline} (Murphy 2011, Stephan and Weaver 2011, Rifkin 2014,
Weaver 2014). [In Europe, the economic crisis was accompanied
by]{.underline} (perceptions of) [a debt crisis, a banking crisis, and a
euro crisis, all interrelated]{.underline}. The financial crisis, debt
crisis, bank crisis, neo-liberal crisis, and global financial collapse
are not just different names but also refer to different, albeit closely
related, empirical phenomena. Importantly, the perception and
representation of such phenomena in crisis terms can give scope for
motivating and/or justifying responses.¶ [[This]{.mark} economic [crisis
has led to]{.mark} measures and dynamics with [**profound impacts** on
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Impacts [that hardly could have been
predicted]{.mark} or anticipated proactively in an objective and neutral
way]{.underline}. As most of the formal and institutional measures
originate from either governmental or financial institutes, it is to be
expected that these favor nondisruptive and reinforcing measures that
shift the cost of recovery toward society and strengthen even more the
potential for financial--economic growth. The resulting austerity
measures and state budget cuts put pressure on public sector employment,
transfer payments, and social welfare systems, contributing to rising
unemployment and underemployment among young and old, and lower
disposable incomes for many in society. The state investments in the
recovery of the banking system as well as budget cuts in welfare, health
care, and education have been put forward as necessary to restabilize
the economy and return to economic growth as before. [Although the
economy now seems on a path to recovery, many of the social and
ecological tensions and challenges still persist.¶]{.underline} From a
countermovement perspective, the dominant measures have mainly
strengthened incumbent regimes and even made more apparent the need for
structural change. [[This becomes apparent by]{.mark} a [growing
dissatisfaction]{.mark} with capitalism, a [lack of trust]{.mark} in
financial institutions, [and]{.mark} an increasing [pressure on]{.mark}
democratic [political institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Castells 2010,
Murphy 2011, Rifkin 2014, Weaver 2014). [[These]{.mark} in turn [focus
attention on]{.mark} the meaning and [quality of life, which can
intensify]{.mark} individuals' [desires to **live in a more
responsible**]{.mark} **and meaningful [way]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as
citizens, workers, and consumers]{.underline}, which again are
accompanied by an increasing attention to social value creation (based
on the attention to these issues in magazines and business literature)
(see O'Riordan 2013).¶ Over 70 years ago, Polanyi (1944) described
countermovements as critical responses to the rise of liberal market
economies in the interwar period. Polanyi argued that countermovements
tend to include both progressive and regressive forces, and he related
the rise of fascism as part of a double countermovement in reaction to
the rise of liberal market economy (Worth 2013). Similarly, contemporary
counternarratives do not only include progressive
sustainability-oriented ideas, but also more regressive ideas as
manifested in populist and/or extremist political parties. Moreover,
counternarratives and grassroots movements are also not always easily
discernible from mainstream discourses. Although discourses on, e.g.,
solidarity economy can be constructed as counternarratives, they have
considerable overlaps with mainstream policy discourses on the "Big
Society" (UK) and "the participation society" (The Netherlands). When
comparing discourses on the circular economy and the sharing economy,
one can find differences in the former being partly associated with a
corporate movement (see, e.g., McKinsey and the Ellen McArthur
Foundation) the latter being more associated with grassroots social
movements (e.g., Peerby). Different discourses are intermingled,
changing over time, forming double movements (Polanyi 1944), or rather
multilayered narratives of change.¶ We use here narratives of change as
an accessible and short summary of discourses on change and innovation
(Avelino et al. 2014). Social (counter)movements, such as the
environmental movement or the antiglobalization movement, can be
experienced as counternarratives of change. These social movements
"struggle against pre-existing cultural and institutional narratives and
the structures of meaning and power they convey" (Davies 2002:25). They
achieve this partly through counternarratives, which "modify existing
beliefs and symbols and their resonance comes from their appeal to
values and expectations that people already hold" (Davies 2002:25). This
challenges us to expand beyond the hegemonic mainstream narrative on,
e.g., the economic crisis, by including a discussion of
counternarratives around the new economy.¶ Thus, we see a double device
of addressing the economic crisis through measures to prevent the
breakdown and restabilization of the existing system, and the rise of
counternarratives and movements that find legitimacy in exactly these
processes and measures. [From antiglobalization or Occupy movements, [we
can discern]{.mark} a **[loss of trust in the dominant economic
model]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} the [growth]{.mark} society
and its associated livelihood model]{.underline} where most material
needs are satisfied through impersonal market exchange. [The formalized
and impersonal market exchange is questioned, resulting in concepts such
as sharing, reciprocity, generalized exchange, or restricted
exchange]{.underline} (see Befu 1977, Peebles 2010 for an overview).
Although the mainstream discourse is still about how to regain adequate
rates of economic growth, [[an underlying]{.mark} longer-sighted
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., counternarrative) [[is emerging
about alternatives]{.mark} for this growth model]{.underline}. [[This
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} (longstanding and more recent) [ideas on
**[degrowth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Schumacher 1973, Fournier 2008),
[green growth]{.underline} (OECD 2009, 2013a), [[or
postgrowth]{.underline}]{.mark} (Jackson 2009). [These
(counter)narratives also question the market logic that constructs human
beings as well as nature as resources and commodities in the production
of goods]{.underline} (Freudenburg et al. 1995).

### Econ D

#### Economic crises cause increased cooperation, [not war]{.underline}

Christopher **Clary 15**, Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT,
Postdoctoral Fellow, Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown
University, "Economic Stress and International Cooperation: Evidence
from International Rivalries," April 22, 2015,
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597712

Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict? Or
might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign
policy? This paper provides new evidence that **[[economic stress
is]{.mark} [associated with conciliatory policies]{.mark}]{.underline}**
between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military
threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to
terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the
competition. [[Drawing on]{.mark} data from **[109 distinct]{.mark}
rival [dyads]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 1950, **[[67 of which
terminated]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the evidence suggests [[rivalries
were]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately [[twice as likely to]{.mark}
[terminate during]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[downturns]{.mark}
than]{.underline} they were [during periods of economic
normalcy]{.underline}. This is true [controlling for **all of the main
alternative explanations**]{.underline} for peaceful relations between
foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability
imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), [as well
as]{.underline} many [other]{.underline} possible [confounding
variables]{.underline}. This research questions existing theories
claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war,
and instead argues that in certain circumstances **[[peace]{.mark} may
[result from economic troubles]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Defining and Measuring Rivalry and Rivalry Termination

I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states
that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a
military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is
likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to
one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to
provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the
imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining
failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites
assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been
reduced dramatically.

This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely
associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph
Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My
definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen
Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which "\[b\]oth actors
view each other as a significant political-military threat and,
therefore, an enemy."2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael
Colaresi, explains further:

The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they
think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations
and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their
constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage.
Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able
to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as
well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign
policies of specific countries.3

Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer
have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that
serves as the basis for this project's empirical analysis.4 This project
measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson
and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry.5

Why Might Economic Crisis Cause Rivalry Termination?

Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary
channels. (1) [Economic [crises lead to **austerity
pressures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[incent leaders to]{.mark} search for ways to [cut defense]{.mark}
expenditures]{.underline}. (2) [Economic [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[encourage]{.mark} **[strategic
reassessment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so that leaders can argue to their
peers and their publics that defense spending can be arrested without
endangering the state. [This can lead to threat deflation, where
[elites]{.mark} attempt to [downplay the seriousness
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the threat posed by [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
former [[rival]{.underline}]{.mark}. (3) If a state faces multiple
threats, [economic [crises provoke]{.mark} elites to consider **[threat
prioritization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a process that is [postponed
during]{.underline} periods of [economic normalcy]{.underline}. (4)
[[Economic crises increase the]{.mark} political and economic [benefit
from]{.mark} **[international]{.mark} economic
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Leaders seek]{.underline}]{.mark}
foreign [[aid]{.underline}]{.mark}, enhanced [[trade,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} increased [[investment]{.mark} from
abroad]{.underline} during periods of economic trouble. This search is
made easier if tensions are reduced with historic rivals. (5) Finally,
during crises, elites are more prone to select leaders who are perceived
as capable of resolving economic difficulties, permitting the emergence
of leaders who hold heterodox foreign policy views. Collectively, these
mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer
conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy.
This section reviews this causal logic in greater detail, while also
providing historical examples that these mechanisms recur in practice.

## 2NC\-\--Framing

### Overview\-\--2NC

#### Err neg\-\--planetary boundaries are *[already]{.underline}* being crossed and decoupling is impossible 

Riccardo **Mastini 18**, PhD student in ecological economics and
political ecology in the Institute of Environmental Science and
Technology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, 6/1/18, "Work in a
World Without Growth,"
https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/work-in-a-world-without-growth/

[A fixation with [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} in economics [[has seen
GDP increase in proportion to **environmental
damage**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [As [planetary limits]{.mark} draw ever
closer and [are]{.mark} even [being surpassed, such a model **cannot be
sustained**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Riccardo Mastini explains how a job
guarantee could open up the way to a sustainable economic model.¶ [Since
the dawn of capitalism, market economies have placed a high emphasis on
labour productivity. Continuous improvements in technology geared
towards productivity increases lead to more output being produced for a
given amount of labour]{.underline}. But crucially these advances also
mean that fewer people are needed to produce the same amount of goods
and services each year. As long as the economy expands fast enough to
offset increases in labour productivity there is no problem. But if the
economy does not grow, people lose their jobs.¶ Economic growth has been
necessary within this system just to prevent mass unemployment.
Communities and the politicians that represent them celebrate the
construction of a new factory not so much for the increase in supply of
some needed product, but because of the jobs it creates. In advanced
economies, the shortage of employment has become more pressing than the
shortage of products. Basically, we produce goods and services mostly to
keep people employed rather than to cater for their needs.¶ But [[what
if]{.mark} economic [growth were]{.mark} to slow down and, eventually,
[come to a halt]{.mark} in the near future? More than half a century of
'growth [propaganda']{.mark} supporting the dogma [that]{.mark} pursuing
[never-ending growth is plausible]{.mark} and desirable [may make
this]{.mark} new prospect [shocking]{.mark} for some. [However, there
is]{.mark} now [overwhelming evidence]{.mark} that **[decoupling]{.mark}
GDP [growth from]{.mark} increases in natural resource and
[energy]{.mark} use [is impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And our
[plundering]{.mark} of Earth's bounty [has **already reached
unsustainable levels**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[with the overshot
of several planetary boundaries]{.underline}.¶ [It is, therefore, time
for]{.underline} a bold public [debate about whether it is desirable to
continue our relentless pursuit of economic growth, with the associated
dire consequences for the health of the planet,]{.underline} simply to
keep people employed. Adopting an economic policy proposal known as the
job guarantee could ensure full employment while our society transitions
towards an economy that no longer grows. All this, without sacrificing
the goods and services needed for just and sustainable prosperity.¶ The
need for planned economic degrowth¶ [The idea of '[degrowth' takes aim
at the **irreconcilable contradiction** between]{.mark} the
[growth]{.mark} imperative]{.underline} of capitalism [[and
sustainability]{.mark} on a finite planet]{.underline}. [Degrowth is
defined as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that
will reduce society's extraction of energy and raw materials and
generation of waste]{.underline}. More broadly, **[degrowth means the
abolition of economic growth as a social objective]{.underline}**.
Instead, degrowth implies a new direction for society, one in which we
live and work differently from today by giving priority to a sustainable
level of wellbeing for all citizens rather than to maximising wealth.

####  Transition [now]{.underline} is better\-\--[diminishing tech returns]{.underline} mean society has already entered "involuntary degrowth"

Mauro **Bonaiuti 18**, professor of ecological economics at the
University of Turin, October 2018, "Are we entering the age of
involuntary degrowth? Promethean technologies and declining returns of
innovation," Journal of Cleaner production, Volume 197, Part 2, p.
1807-1808

In the last few years [the economic slowdown has been noted even by
standard economists who have started to speak openly of "**secular
stagnation**"]{.underline}20. The basic idea is that, [after the
financial crisis, despite years of zero interest rate there are [no
signs]{.mark} of a [satisfy]{.mark}ing [recovery]{.mark} of the global
economy]{.underline}. Recognising, as did Larry Summers, 2014, Summers,
2015 and Paul Krugman (2014), that what [[we are experiencing]{.mark} is
[something]{.mark} quite [different from an **ordinary
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is an important step that in some way
legitimize the debate on post-growth]{.underline} society. However, the
discussion on secular stagnation is rooted in standard macroeconomic
theory. Even if from different perspectives, all these authors21
advocate economic interventions aimed at stimulating a return to growth.
Above all [these analyses do not offer any indication of the length or
magnitude of future cycles of innovation]{.underline}. As
Georgescu-Roegen has already pointed out (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971,
Georgescu-Roegen, 2011) [[standard economics lacks]{.mark} an
[evolutionary theory and]{.mark}, consequently [does not]{.mark} even
take into [consider]{.mark}ation the possible **[irreversible
changes]{.mark}** in the system]{.underline} (as degrowth supporters
do). [From this perspective the bioeconomic approach seems more
promising: it does not only ascertain the slowing down of innovation
processes, but offers an explanation of it, making it part of a more
general hypothesis on the evolutionary trend of the system]{.underline}
(the Great Wave), open to various possible future scenarios.¶ 7.
Conclusions¶ The concept of Promethean Technologies is one of
Georgescu-Roegen's fundamental contributions to bioeconomic theory. It
reveals how the process of [innovation is not only the outcome of small
incremental variations but is also the result of discontinuous,
epoch-making innovation.]{.underline} Since **[[greater complexity
requires more]{.mark} accessible [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
Promethean [technologies are the only ones capable of producing a leap
in the scale of complexity of human societies]{.underline}.¶ Tainter's
principle of Diminishing Marginal Returns, on the other hand, offers a
basic understanding of societal dynamics as a consequence of increasing
complexity. [Increasing [complexity leads,]{.mark} in fact, [to
**diminishing returns**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By integrating G-R's
bio-economic view with Tainter's principle of diminishing returns, the
author has formulated the hypothesis that, after the
Promethean/Industrial Revolution returns on investment in complexity
follow a "Great Wave" trend.¶ The second part of the paper offers an
initial enquiry into the Great Wave hypothesis, using Total Factor
Productivity as an indicator of returns on innovation. The analysis of
data shows that the period after the Industrial Revolution can be
divided into three large cycles (IR1, IR2, IR3), and that each cycle
presents a S-shaped trend, albeit of a different magnitude and
duration.¶ In the US the application of coal/steam-engine/telegraph
technology stimulated a rapid increase in productivity, reaching a peak
between 1869 and 1892 (at almost 2%). Yet it was to be the great
innovations of the second industrial revolution (the electric engine and
the internal combustion engine) with their momentous potential both for
manufacturing and domestic consumption (electric light, indoor plumbing)
that took TFP values to their peak (2.78%) and, more than that, kept
them high (at around 2%) for at least another 25 years, thanks in
particular to innovations in the transport system. However, after the
peak in the 1930s productivity decreased until it reached a modest 0.34%
in the period 1973--95. [Although the use of computers and ICT has led
to a significant revival of productivity, both the empirical evidence
and theoretical reasons lead one to conclude that the
[innovations]{.mark} introduced by IR3 [are not]{.mark} powerful [enough
to compensate for the declining returns]{.mark} of IR2]{.underline}.¶
This of course does not exclude the possibility that a new expansive
cycle may follow the decline of IR3. What the Great Wave hypothesis
suggests, however, is that - without the intervention of a new
Promethean technology - it is likely to be less influential, and
briefer, than the previous one: a conclusion that it would be impossible
to draw by applying the instruments of standard macroeconomic theory
(Summers, 2014, Summers, 2015, Krugman, 2014; but also Gordon, 2015).
This is the reason for emphasis having been placed here on a few
bio-economic concepts and on complex system theory.¶ In short, an
analysis of TFP data for the three cycles after the Industrial
Revolution seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a Great Wave.
[This means that the U.S. economy seems to have reached its first
threshold of mutation]{.underline} - [and hence entered a phase of
diminishing returns on innovation]{.underline} -in the thirties. This
conclusion, moreover, thus appears to be consistent with evidence from
research in other fields, i.e. energy (Hall et al., 2008), mineral
resources (Bardi, 2014), agriculture (Coelli and Prasada Rao, 2005),
health, education and scientific research, (Tainter, 2006, Strumsky et
al., 2010), demonstrating that [[advanced]{.mark} capitalist
[societies]{.mark}]{.underline} (the U.S., Europe and Japan) [[have
entered a phase of **declining**]{.mark} **marginal
[returns]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or **involuntary degrowth** in]{.mark}
many **[key sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bonaiuti, 2014),
[[with]{.mark} possible major [detrimental effects on]{.mark} the
[system's capacity to maintain its]{.mark} present institutional
[framework]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[**Climate change** is an **existential risk** that could]{.mark}
abruptly **[end]{.mark} human [civilisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
because of a catastrophic "failure of imagination" by global leaders to
understand and act on the science and evidence before them.

At the London School of Economics in 2008, Queen Elizabeth questioned:
"Why did no one foresee the timing, extent and severity of the Global
Financial Crisis?" The British Academy answered a year later: "A
psychology of denial gripped the financial and corporate world... \[it
was\] the failure of the collective imagination of many bright people...
to understand the risks to the system as a whole".

A "failure of imagination" has also been identified as one of the
reasons for the breakdown in US intelligence around the 9/11 attacks in
2001.

A similar failure is occurring with climate change today.

The problem is widespread at the senior levels of government and global
corporations. A 2016 report, Thinking the unthinkable, based on
interviews with top leaders around the world, found that:

"A proliferation of 'unthinkable' events... has revealed a new fragility
at the highest levels of corporate and public service leaderships. Their
ability to spot, identify and handle unexpected, non-normative events
is... perilously inadequate at critical moments... Remarkably, [[there
remains]{.mark} a deep **[reluctance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or what
might be called 'executive myopia', [[to see]{.mark} and contemplate
even the possibility [that 'unthinkables' might
happen]{.mark}]{.underline}, let alone how to handle them.

Such failures are manifested in two ways in climate policy. At the
political, bureaucratic and business level in underplaying the high-end
risks and in failing to recognise that the existential risk of climate
change is totally different from other risk categories. And [[at the
**research level** in **underestimating** the]{.mark} rate of [climate
change **impact**]{.mark} and costs, [along with]{.mark} an
[**under-emphasis** on]{.mark}, and poor communication of, those
**[high-end risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Existential risk

An existential risk is an adverse outcome that would either annihilate
intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential.
For example, a big meteor impact, large-scale nuclear war, or sea levels
70 metres higher than today.

[[Existential risks are not amenable to]{.mark} the
reactive]{.underline} (learn from failure) [approach of **[conventional
risk management]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and [we cannot]{.mark}
necessarily [rely on]{.mark} the]{.underline} institutions, moral norms,
or [[**social attitudes** developed from]{.mark} our experience with
[managing **other**]{.mark} sorts of **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Because]{.mark} the [consequences are so severe]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- perhaps [the end of human global civilisation]{.underline} as we
know it --- researchers say that ["[even for an honest]{.mark},
truth-seeking, and well-intentioned [investigator it is
difficult]{.mark} [to think]{.mark} and act [rationally in regard
to]{.mark}... [existential risks]{.mark}".]{.underline}

Yet [[the **evidence is clear** that climate change]{.mark} already
[poses an **existential risk** to **global** **economic** and societal
**stability**]{.mark} and to **human civilisation** [that]{.mark}
[requires an **emergency response**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Temperature
rises that are now in prospect could reduce the global human population
by 80% or 90%. But this conversation is taboo, and [[the few who speak
out are admonished as]{.mark} being **[overly
alarmist]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Prof. Kevin Anderson considers that "[a [4°]{.mark}C future]{.underline}
\[relative to pre-industrial levels\] [[is incompatible with an
organized global community]{.underline}]{.mark}, [is likely to be
**[beyond]{.mark} '[adaptation']{.mark}**, is [devastating to]{.mark}
the majority of [**ecosystems**, and]{.mark} has a high probability of
[not]{.mark} being [stable]{.mark}]{.underline}". He says: "If you have
got a population of nine billion by 2050 and you hit 4°C, 5°C or 6°C,
you might have half a billion people surviving". Asked at a 2011
conference in Melbourne about the difference between a 2°C world and a
4°C world, Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber replied in two words: "Human
civilisation".

In the end, perhaps [[the **most important conclusion** in the
Nature]{.mark} Climate Change [paper is]{.mark} the **simplest** and the
one that **we already knew**]{.underline}: "[[a **rapid transformation**
in]{.mark} **energy [consumption]{.mark}** and land use [is needed in

At this point, [[**whether it's possible** to hit]{.mark} various

**[All]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the [science]{.mark}** [and modeling

[faces serious danger]{.mark}** [and needs to **reduce**]{.mark}
**carbon [emissions to zero]{.mark}** [as **quickly as
possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The chances of us getting our collective shit together and accomplishing
what these scenarios describe are \... slim. There are so many vested
interests and so much public aversion to rapid change, so many
governments to be coordinated, so many economic and technology trends
that must fall just the right way. It's daunting.

Conversely, [the [chances of]{.mark} us **[overdoing
it]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- **[[trying too
hard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[spending too much]{.mark}** money,
**[reducing emissions too much or]{.mark} too [fast]{.mark}** ---
[are]{.mark} **effectively [nil]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So [[the **only rule** of **climate policy**]{.mark} that really matters
is: **[go as hard and fast as possible, forever and ever,

[[Human pressures]{.mark} on Earth [have introduced "a **new domain of
risk**" for]{.mark} **global [civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}
comparable to the 2008 recession, warns a report published Tuesday.

[**[Climate change]{.mark}**, **[biod]{.mark}**iversity
**[loss]{.mark}**, **[soil infertility]{.mark}**,
**[defo]{.mark}**restation, and **[ocean acidification]{.mark}** are
among the manmade threats that [affect **ag**]{.mark}riculture,
**[energy]{.mark}**, **[public health]{.mark}**, economic [**growth**,
and **immigration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Current [**disruptions** to
the **environment** could]{.mark} **seriously [destabilize those
sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[which would]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[**amplify** social **conflicts** and spark]{.mark} widespread
civic **[unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the report says.

These new findings from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR),
a UK-based think tank, suggest that [[**any one** of **these risks** is
poised to set off]{.mark} a [**chain reaction** that could
create]{.mark} a **[global crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is
[[**greater than the sum** of each]{.mark} **individual
problem**]{.underline}.

Authored by IPPR researchers Laurie Laybourn-Langton, Lesley Rankin, and
Darren Baxter, [the paper likened the potential risk to the 20**08**
Great **Recession**]{.underline}, which was caused when the American
subprime mortgage crisis snowballed into a worldwide financial disaster.

[One potential example of a trigger is [a **sudden crash** in **carbon
assets**]{.mark}]{.underline} [due to their role in greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}. [If **carbon prices rapidly drop** [to **keep
pace** with carbon **budget limits**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it [could
have **ripple effects** throughout the]{.mark} **global
[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [[**insurance industry** and **financial institutions**
could]{.mark} also [become **volatile**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Insurers
are]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[struggling to adapt
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [increase in [**property** and **casualty
losses** from]{.mark} **extreme [weather]{.mark}** events]{.underline}.
[[Climate]{.mark}-related natural [disasters are]{.mark} [expected to
intensify]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially [[**exposing companies** to
tanking]{.underline}]{.mark} from a surplus of claims.

"In the extreme, [[environmental breakdown could trigger]{.mark}
**catastrophic breakdown** of **human systems**]{.underline},
[driving]{.underline} a rapid process of '**[[runaway
collapse']{.underline}]{.mark}** [in which [**economic**, **social**,
and **political shocks cascade** through the **global**]{.mark}ly linked
**[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[in]{.underline} much [the same way
[as]{.mark} occurred [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the wake of the global
financial crisis of 2007/**[[08]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said the
authors.

The relationship between climate change and violent conflict has been
the subject of intense academic as well as policy debate over the past
few decades. Adverse economic conditions constitute an important channel
linking the two phenomena. Here, [[I review]{.mark} the [**theoretical
arguments** and]{.mark} recent [**empirical evidence** connecting
**climate-driven adverse econ**]{.mark}omic [**conditions** to
**conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Recent Findings

[[Climate-induced adverse econ]{.mark}omic [conditions]{.mark} could
[lead to conflict by **lowering**]{.mark} the **[opportunity cost of
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[weakening **state
capacity**]{.underline}, [and **exacerbating**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[political and economic
**[inequalities]{.mark}**/grievances]{.underline}. The empirical
literature does not provide robust evidence for a "direct"
climate-economy-conflict relationship.

Summary

[Recent [empirical research offers **considerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
suggestive [**[evidence]{.mark}** that **[climate-driven
econ]{.mark}**omic [**downturns** lead to **conflict** in
**ag**]{.mark}riculture-[**dependent regions** and in
**combination**]{.mark} and interaction [with]{.mark} other
[**socioeconomic** and **political factors**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Future research should further examine the context(s) in which
climate-induced adverse economic conditions led to conflict, and also
identify and test the precise empirical implications of the theoretical
mechanisms through which these adverse economic conditions lead to
conflict using disaggregated data and appropriate estimation procedures.

#### Degrowth is key\-\--only way to avoid collapse

Federico **Demaria 18**, Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Technology
from Autonomous University of Barcelona, researcher in ecological
economics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, 2/22/18, "Why
economic growth is not compatible with environmental sustainability,"
https://theecologist.org/2018/feb/22/why-economic-growth-not-compatible-environmental-sustainability

\'Growth for the sake of growth\' remains the credo of all governments
and international institutions, including the European Commission. ¶
[Economic growth is presented as the panacea that can solve any of the
world\'s problems]{.underline}: poverty, inequality, sustainability, you
name it. Left-wing and right-wing policies only differ on how to achieve
it. ¶ However, [there is an uncomfortable **[scientific
truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that has to be faced]{.underline}:
**[economic [growth is environmentally
unsustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, beyond a certain
threshold already surpassed by EU countries, [socially it isn\'t
necessary.]{.underline} [The central question then becomes: how can we
manage an economy without growth]{.underline}? ¶ **[Enough is
enough]{.underline}**¶ Kenneth Boulding, the economist, famously said
that: "[Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in
a **finite world**]{.underline} [is either a madman or an
economist]{.underline}". ¶ [Ecological economists argue that the economy
is physical, while mainstream economists seem to believe it is
metaphysical]{.underline}. ¶ Social metabolism is the study of material
and energy flows within the economy. On the input side of the economy,
[key material [resources are limited, and]{.mark} many are
**[peaking]{.mark}** [including **oil**]{.mark} and
phosphorus.]{.underline} On the output side, **[humanity is trespassing
planetary boundaries]{.underline}**. ¶ [Climate change is the evidence
of the limited assimilative capacity of ecosystems]{.underline}. It is
the planet saying: \'Enough is enough!\'. ¶ [Mainstream
economists]{.underline} - finally convinced by the existence of
biophysical limits - [have started to argue that economic growth can be
decoupled from the consumption of energy]{.underline} and materials. ¶
Trade off¶ **[Historical data series]{.underline}** [demonstrates that
this]{.underline} - up to now - [has not happened]{.underline}. At most,
[there is relative decoupling]{.underline} - a decrease in resource use
per unit of GDP. [But, **[there is no absolute decoupling which is what
matters for sustainability]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [an absolute decrease
of environmental resources consumption]{.underline}. ¶ [The only periods
of absolute dematerialisation coincide with economic
recession]{.underline}. [Trade should also be taken into
account]{.underline}, to avoid externalisation of pollution intensive
activities outside the EU. ¶ [The current economy cannot be
circular]{.underline}. [The main reason being that **[energy cannot be
recycled]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and materials only up to a point. [The
global economy recycles less than 10 percent of materials]{.underline};
about 50 percent of processed materials are used to provide energy and
are thus not available for recycling. [It is simple]{.underline}:
[economic growth is not compatible with environmental
sustainability]{.underline}. ¶ [The list of nice oxymorons is long -
from sustainable development to its reincarnations like green economy or
green growth]{.underline} - [but **wishful thinking does not solve real
problems**.]{.underline} [[Increase in GDP leads to increase in]{.mark}
material and [energy use]{.mark}, and therefore to]{.underline}
**[environmental unsustainability.]{.underline}** ¶ No magic bullet¶
**[[Tech]{.mark}nology and market based [solutions are not magic
bullets]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Faith in technology has become
religious: scientific evidence shows that, based on past trends in
technological improvement, **[these are coming]{.mark} way [too
slowly]{.mark} to avoid irreversible climate change**]{.underline}. ¶
For instance, [efficiency [improvements lead to **rebound
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in the context of economic
growth]{.underline} ([the more efficient you are, the more you
consume]{.underline}; e.g. cars and consumption of gasoline).
[[Renewable energy produces **less net**
]{.mark}**energy**]{.underline}, [because it has a lower
EROI]{.underline} (Energy Return on Investement) [than fossil
fuels]{.underline}. For this, and other reasons, [**[it cannot satisfy
current levels of]{.mark} energy [consumption]{.mark}**, []{.mark}which
therefore needs to be reduced]{.underline}. ¶ [Most of the world's
fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground, unburned, to keep a
global temperature rise to no more than 2°C]{.underline}. In fact,
[[fossil fuels should be]{.mark} called [unburnable]{.mark}
fuels]{.underline}. ¶ Science sometimes brings bad news. An article
recently published in Nature Sustainability argues that: "No country in
the world meets the basic needs of its citizens at a globally
sustainable level of resource use." The question then is: How can the
conditions for a good life for all within planetary boundaries be
generated?¶ [The uncomfortable truth to be faced by policy makers is the
following: Economic growth is ecologically unsustainable. The [total
consumption]{.mark} of materials and energy [needs to be
reduced]{.mark}, starting with developed countries]{.underline}. ¶
De-growth strategy¶ [Economic growth might also not be socially
desirable]{.underline}. [**Inequalities** are on the rise, **poverty**
has not been eliminated and life satisfaction is stagnant]{.underline}.
¶ [Economic growth is fueled by **debt**]{.underline}, [which
corresponds to a colonization of the future]{.underline}. [This debt
cannot be paid, and **[the financial system is prone to
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. ¶ For instance, scientifically it is
not clear how the European Union will achieve a low-carbon economy in
the context of economic growth, since it implies a reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. ¶ In fact,
climatologists Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows have argued convincingly
that: "[\[[F\]or]{.mark} a reasonable probability of [avoiding]{.mark}
the 2°C characterization of]{.underline} **[[dangerous climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the wealthier [nations
need]{.mark}]{.underline}, temporarily, [to adopt a
**[de-growth]{.mark}** strategy]{.underline}."¶ Obviously, a transition
from a growth society to a degrowth one poses several challenges.
However, the emerging field of ecological macroeconomics is starting to
address them convincingly. ¶ Happiness factor¶ [Happiness and economics
literature shows that GDP growth is not needed for well-being, because
there are other important determinants.]{.underline} **[High life
expectancy is compatible with low carbon emissions]{.underline}**, [but
high incomes are not]{.underline}. Moreover, [lack of growth may
increase inequalities unless there is redistribution.]{.underline} ¶ In
any case, [the issue is not whether we shall abandon economic growth.
The question is how]{.underline}. Scientific debates around it are on
the rise, but I am afraid policy making is behind. ¶ There are good
signs: critiques of GDP as an indicator of well-being are common, there
are policy proposals and degrowth is entering into the parliaments. This
is not new. For example, in 1972 Sicco Mansholt, a Dutch social-democrat
who was then EU Commissioner for agriculture, wrote a letter to the
President of the EU Commission Franco Maria Malfatti, urging him to
seriously take into account limits to growth in EU economic policy. ¶
Mansholt himself became President of the European Commission after only
two months, but for too short a term to push a zero growth agenda. ¶ The
time is ripe not only for a scientific degrowth research agenda, but
also for a political one. As ecological economists Tim Jackson and Peter
Victor argued in The New York Times: "[Imagining a world without growth
is among the most vital and urgent tasks for society to engage
in]{.underline}."

#### Growth is [terminally unsustainable]{.underline} -- [all efficiency]{.underline} is limited, any even [green tech]{.underline} causes [pollution]{.underline} and [resource depletion]{.underline} -- we need to [directly end growth]{.underline}

**Heinberg 19** \[Richard William Heinberg is an American journalist and
educator who has written extensively on energy, economic, and ecological
issues, including oil depletion. He is the author of 13 books, and
presently serves as the senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute. The
End of Economic Growth Is Inevitable. Let's Plan for It. January 15,
2019. <https://undark.org/2019/01/15/economic-growth/>\]

The trouble is, [[a **bigger economy** uses **more**]{.mark} **stuff**
[than a **smaller one**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} happen to [[live on a **finite
planet**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, [an [**end to growth** is
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Ending growth is]{.mark} also
[**desirable** if we want]{.mark}]{.underline} to leave some stuff
(**[[minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[forests]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[biod]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} **[stable
climate]{.mark}**]{.underline}) for our kids and their kids. Further, if
growth is meant to have anything to do with increasing quality of life,
there is plenty of evidence to suggest it has passed the point of
diminishing returns: Even though the U.S. economy is 5.5 times bigger
now than it was in 1960 (in terms of real GDP), America is losing ground
on its happiness index.

So how do we stop growth without making life miserable --- and maybe
even making it better?

To start with, there are two strategies that many people already agree
on. We should substitute good consumption for bad, for example using
renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. And we should use stuff more
efficiently --- making products that last longer and then repairing and
recycling them instead of tossing them in a landfill. The reason these
strategies are uncontroversial is that they reduce growth's
environmental damage without impinging on growth itself.

But [**[renewable]{.mark}** energy **[tech]{.mark}**nology **[still
requires materials]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[aluminum]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[glass]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[silicon]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[copper]{.underline}]{.mark} for
solar panels; [[concrete]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[steel]{.underline}]{.mark}, [copper]{.underline}, and
[[neodymium]{.underline}]{.mark} for wind turbines). And **[[efficiency
has limits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, we can reduce the time
required to send a message to nearly zero, but from then on,
**[[improvements are infinitesimal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other
words, [[**substitution and efficiency** are]{.underline}]{.mark} good,
but they're **[[not sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[**Even if** we
**somehow** arrive at a **near-virtual economy**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**[if it is growing]{.mark}**, [we'll]{.mark} still [use more]{.mark}
stuff, and [the result will be]{.mark} [**pollution** and **resource
depletion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sooner or later, [[we have to **do
away** with **growth directly**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### [Globalization]{.underline} causes [inequality]{.underline} that [strengthens backlash]{.underline} to growth -- that makes [recessions inevitable]{.underline}, but [maintaining growth]{.underline} causes [warming]{.underline}

[Major [transformations or convergences of economic systems
generate]{.mark}]{.underline} great efficiencies and
**[[wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the larger the global market, the
bigger the payouts to winners.4 Unfortunately, [[these]{.mark} benefits
[come with]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of changes in **jobs**]{.mark}, [**markets**, and **ways of
life**]{.mark}. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**current
convergence**]{.mark} of world economies [is more
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline} than the first [[**not only** because
**vastly more people** and **polities** are involved]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} also [because **climate change** calls into
question]{.mark} the **[sustainability of growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A standard measure of political instability used by European political
scientists takes the same parties' vote totals from election to election
and calculates the swings in the vote, adds them across parties, divides
by 2, and voila!---an instability index, as shown below.

Those data show that in both large and small European democracies, as in
the United States, political instability has risen since the 1970s and
especially after 2008. What, to return to the main question, could
account for this increase?

One answer is, of course, the upheaval caused by the transformation or
convergence of economies, especially in social and economic structures.
But the changes wrought by the current transformation are not the same
as those of the 19th century, due to differences in a number of
conditions. By 1900 a new class had come to prominence: the blue-collar
industrial worker. While the two most common types of workers in 1900,
farm workers and household servants, were geographically scattered and
therefore hard to organize, factory employees worked and lived together
in large towns, such as in St. Denis, outside Paris, in the valleys of
Pennsylvania and Germany, and in Manchester, England. They were not,
contra Marx, a majority, but through their ability to organize, they
would come to dominate politics in the industrial world.

These workers of the early 20th century did not get overtime, pensions,
vacations, sick days, or health insurance, and they had no job security.
By 1950, however, industrial workers were the largest single group in
every Western democratic country and, by and large, unionized workers
had attained middle-class living standards. They enjoyed job security,
pensions, paid vacations, unemployment insurance, and health plans. And
they had, in large part, attained these things because they had gained
political power, either by forming parties composed of trade unions,
such as Labour in Britain, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany,
and the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) in France, or by using
their union base to influence left-of-center parties, such as in the
United States.

Sixty years later, the number of industrial workers in the United States
has declined from more than 40 percent to less than 20 percent. The
disappearance of blue-collar jobs has been slower in most other Western
democracies, but by the 1980s others showed declines similar to the
United States. Thus, in Europe today, the percentage of the labor force
in blue-collar or industrial jobs is well below half of what it was in
the 1950s. In short, industrial workers no longer dominate political
parties. They have become just another interest group.

Economists differ on when the shift began, but it seems clear that in
the 1970s the loss of blue-collar industrial jobs accelerated. American
companies automated everything they could and exported capital overseas
where production costs were lower. Other countries faced a choice: keep
the jobs by fiat and lose out on productivity, making the economy worse
off; or allow automation and export, enjoy increased productivity, and
suffer the wage problems that afflicted the United States. The effects
of their choices had profound consequences for political parties and
systems.

By the 1950s, manufacturing workers across Europe and the United States
were well organized, and political parties revolved around them. In the
United States, Harry Truman could win re-election in 1948 by campaigning
against section 14B of the Taft-Hartley Act (which permits states to
pass right-to-work laws), while in the United Kingdom politics was
divided into two categories: Labour and anti-Labour. From 1945 through
1957, the French Left, both Communists and Socialists, never fell below
40 percent popularity and averaged about 45 percent of the vote for the
six elections of the post-World War II Fourth Republic. In Italy,
labor-based parties never had less than 35 percent of the vote and rose
to 40 percent in the late 1950s. Their main rival, the anti-Left-labor
Christian Democrats, went from 36 percent in 1946 to 49 percent in 1948,
and throughout the 1950s never fell below 40 percent or failed to be in
government. In Sweden, Socialists and Communists had majorities in every
post-World War II election until 1973. The politics of Belgium, the
Netherlands, Denmark, and other European countries were essentially
contests between labor-Left parties versus Christian Right parties. In
West Germany, the first postwar election in 1949 yielded a narrow
win---by less than 2 percent---for Konrad Adenauer of the Christian
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU). Socialist Party
leader Kurt Schumacher refused a grand coalition, thus putting the
leftist parties in opposition, where they remained throughout the 1950s.
Again, politics could be described as Left-labor versus Christian
Democratic conservative. At present, leftist parties are quite
different. They can no longer be elected largely by their base of
manufacturing workers and thus have had to accommodate some conservative
market principles: witness Gerhard Schroeder, the most recent SPD Prime
Minister, on reforming the German economy.

Because the labor/anti-labor divide no longer dominates political
systems in Europe, parties have to build majorities by adding other
constituencies. In the United States, the Democratic Party added
minorities, cultural liberals, and others, but in the process created
Reagan Democrats as pro-labor but socially conservative voters abandoned
the Party. In Britain, the Labour Party lost voters overall from 2010 to
2015, but gained among voters aged 18 to 30, especially if they were
urban and socially liberal. They also did well with minorities and
non-native UK voters. Labour paid a price, however, losing voters over
65, who have the highest turnout rates (about 80 percent), to the
Tories. Labour also lost votes to UKIP, the Liberals, and the Greens. In
short, putting majorities together is difficult in a diverse,
heterogeneous economy, because economic interests diverge while social
and lifestyle issues now matter a good deal more than they once did.

In France, the Socialist Party has been undergoing a similar change. In
2015, activist François Sabado called it "an acceleration in the
bourgeois transformation of social democracy . . . \[T\]he socialist
parties have become less and less working class and more and more
bourgeois."5 As is the case in the United States, Britain, and other
Western countries, these bourgeois, socially liberal, urban partisans
don't always see eye-to-eye with their blue-collar fellow leftists. In
Spain and Greece, parties of the Left have seen revivals: Podemos in the
former and Syriza in the latter. Both parties seek to renegotiate their
countries' debt structure and to ease the austerity requirements imposed
by the European Union, and both draw support from younger, urban voters.
Syriza managed to take power in Greece and even retained it despite
failing to persuade the European Union to abandon its austerity program.

The globalization of economies has generated changes in parties on the
Right as well. Buoyed by the election of Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher, right-wing parties gained ascendance in the 1980s. In Germany,
Helmut Kohl and the CDU dominated national politics from 1982 to 1996;
they liberalized the political agenda and put moral issues up for
debate. In France, the Right lost the presidency to François Mitterand
in 1981 but won departmental, municipal, and European parliamentary
elections in 1982, 1983, and 1984 respectively. In 1986, it won the
National Assembly. Moreover, while Mitterand followed a radical economic
policy from 1981 to 1983---which included nationalizing some key
industries, increasing the minimum wage, and establishing a five-week
vacation period, among other reforms---he made a "tournant de la rigeur"
(shift to the right) when the economy worsened.

In Italy, according to scholar Paolo Morisi, "the turn from the mass to
a catchall party was the result of the blurring of class divisions under
the unprecedented economic growth of the 1960s. Both working class and
conservative parties lost their raison d'etre as unique representatives
of particular social groups."6 The Socialists, under Bettino Craxi, kept
the Communists out of government and formed the governments of the 1980s
with the Christian Democrats. The conservative, anti-centralization Lega
Nord came to the fore in the 1990s, and Silvio Berlusconi and Forza
Italia came to prominence in 1994.

The turn away from the Left was not, of course, universal, and differed
from country to country. However, as the labor base of industrial
workers declined, the basic premises of politics shifted, and the
parties of both Left and Right had to find new majorities in a changing
economic and political reality. Parties of the Left from Sweden to
Germany to Italy had to adjust their policies to keep their economies
competitive, in light of capital's growth in prominence relative to
labor. On the Right, parties had to deal with rising inequality and job
losses in the new sharing economy, and some began favoring government
aid. Overall, the changing economy has driven many Socialist parties in
Europe to support economic programs that differ only slightly from those
of conservative parties. Conversely, European conservative parties,
while generally defending markets, have endorsed comprehensive welfare
programs (see the CDU/CSU in Germany and France's neo-Gaullists, for
example). Since no party, country, or individual leader has discovered
the policy path to achieve economic growth while substantially
mitigating the ills such growth engenders, we should expect to see
political instability grow, not decline, and with it distrust of
government.

Such instability will vary depending on economic well-being. Though
political instability has risen across Europe and the United States,
some have it worse than others:.

The contrast between the relatively healthy economies of Switzerland,
Norway, Germany, and Denmark and the less prosperous economies of
France, Greece, Italy, and Spain is obvious. Political instability has
risen in the prosperous economies since the late 1970s, but not nearly
as steeply as it did in the four poorer economies. This is unsurprising:
Since employment opportunities, expendable income, and job stability are
more prevalent in good economies, voters are more likely to stick to
their traditional political preferences. Where unemployment levels are
high and expendable income is lower, voters shift preferences, looking
for alternatives to provide economic stability in their lives.

In sum, as economic modernization decreased the number of manufacturing
jobs that paid middle-class wages, political stability declined. Over
time, the Left could not win with its labor base alone and had to modify
its appeal in order to create majorities. Parties on the Right benefited
early on, but over time also had problems creating majorities with old
policies. The type of political system and electoral rules affected the
strategy of political parties. In first-past-the-post, two-party systems
like that of the United States, parties have to scramble for majorities.
Thus, in the United States, Republicans picked up some blue-collar
workers who had guns and traditional values, as well as voters who
opposed abortion. Democrats picked up minorities and pro-choice voters
who had been Republican, but neither party has created a stable
majority. In multiparty systems, with forces opposed to globalization,
the new economies, and the free flow of immigrants, movements like the
People's Party in Denmark and the Front Nationale in France arise. In
Italy, the neo-fascists came and went and came again, while Lega Nord
rose to prominence on a platform of separating the non-productive South
from the efficient North.

One burning issue that arises under increasing globalization in both
Europe and the United States is immigration. When the economy is
shifting and inequality is rising, the influx of outsiders generates
controversy. In the United States, a Donald Trump tries to capture the
anti-immigrant vote through the Republican Party primaries, while in
France an entire party, the Front Nationale, represents this view. In
Italy, Lega Nord has increased its vote shares by focusing on
immigration. However, anti-immigration voters and movements, regardless
of the specific arrangements, need not be right-wingers on other issues,
as attested by the Front Nationale's position on social welfare and
protection for French workers, or the Danish People's Party's position
on cruelty to animals, school funding, and aid for the elderly and the
needy. Other examples abound, but suffice it to say that the political
instability observable in Europe and the United States takes multiple
forms depending on the nature of the political system and the electoral
rules that obtain in it.

However, the cause is the same: [the [**transformation** of the **world
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As we move toward]{.mark} ever **[more
interconnectedness]{.mark}**, an economy in which [employees
take]{.mark} their [skills from one company to the next]{.mark} and
[both parents work]{.mark}, [the **challenge** of]{.mark} forming
[**coherent, stable political parties** is
**magnified**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those countries able to keep

[[Concepts of]{.mark} the '[circular
economy'---involving]{.mark}]{.underline} a fundamental [[reorganization
of the way societies]{.mark} produce, [manage]{.mark} and consume
[resources through]{.mark}]{.underline} wide-scale practices of
[[recycling]{.mark} across production and consumption
chains---[bear]{.mark} considerable [importance]{.mark}]{.underline} to
this sort of vision. The circular economy brings to the fore the
necessity of reusing and recycling raw materials to the most efficient
extent possible to support the sustainability of production and
consumption chains relative to increasingly depleted mineral ores and
higher energy costs for their extraction, refining and input into
manufacturing. [[Numerous companies are taking the concept seriously
in]{.mark} the [recognition of]{.mark} current and looming
[environmental risks]{.mark} to their supply chains]{.underline}, but
human civilization must begin to do so in the wider context of a
recognition that the animating ideology of the current phase-shift of
civilization is deeply misguided.

A major report to the Club of Rome tracking the depletion of the
planet's mineral ores finds that [[by the end of this century]{.mark},
higher quality [ores critical to]{.mark} the growth of [industrial
civilization]{.mark} as we know it [will be]{.mark} largely
[depleted]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the report shows that [[a 'circular
economy']{.mark} approach [has strong potential to allow existing
minerals to be recycled with]{.mark} minimum losses and a [high degree
of efficiency]{.mark} sufficient to maintain a high technology society
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[a]{.mark} new [post-capitalist
economic context]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bardi 2014 ).

The ESD--HSD amplifying feedbacks discussed in this study demonstrate
that the [[twenty-first century is]{.mark} rapidly [transitioning to a
crisis convergence threshold heralding the]{.mark} [inevitable demise
of]{.mark} the [endless growth]{.mark} model of neoliberal finance
capitalism that currently animates industrial civilization as we know
it.]{.underline} This points to the urgency of adaptation to prepare for
the emergence of a new evolutionary phase-shift in the form of
post-capitalism---a concept whose unspecified nature is important
precisely because [it [opens up new possibilities for economic
organization]{.mark} which are [not limited by the failures of]{.mark}
prevailing [economic orthodoxy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The rejection of
that orthodoxy as limited springs from the recognition that the doctrine
of unlimited economic growth is nothing less than a fundamental
violation of the laws of physics. In short, it is the stuff of
cranks---yet it is nevertheless the ideology that informs policymakers
and pundits alike. [[Post-capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other
hand, [[seeks to ground itself]{.mark} in harmony [with the]{.mark}
biophysical [environment]{.mark}, not by rejecting the ideals of human
prosperity and well-being, but by decoupling them from the fetish for
endless material growth.]{.underline}

[[That]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn [[paves the
way]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially, [[for]{.mark} a renewed sense of
human [value]{.mark} and purpose [beyond]{.mark} the confines of
[material production]{.mark} and consumption, rejuvenated by a
consciousness of humanity's embeddedness in its
environment]{.underline}. The magical thinking of endless growth must
make way for a post-materialist ethic of human interconnectedness with
itself and its biophysical context.

Groundbreaking economic work on this theme of 'prosperity without
growth' has been forthcoming from several quarters, and provides
mounting evidence that the endless growth model of economics has not
just failed to deliver meaningful prosperity to the world's poorest, but
is incapable of doing so as it continues to generate inequality,
environmental destruction, and to eventually undermine its very own
basis (Jackson 2009). This body of work also demonstrates that
meaningful prosperity in the sense of providing for human needs and
well-being in high technology societies remains possible in a
fundamentally re-organized post-capitalist economy. In this framework,
[human [progress can continue]{.mark} but [within a new paradigm in
which limited material development is]{.mark} [mobilized]{.mark} to meet
fundamental human needs [through]{.mark}]{.underline} extension of
[[human]{.mark} relations [instead of market relations]{.mark}, a
deepening of [democracy, enhancing ecosystems, and more equal
distribution of wealth]{.mark}. Inevitably]{.underline}, therefore,
[post-capitalism will be incommensurate with]{.underline} the features
of endless growth associated with industrial forms of capitalism:
namely, [continuously growing material throughput]{.underline} driven
[by]{.underline} ever [growing consumption by unrestrained population
growth]{.underline} (Victor 2010 ; Fournier 2008 ; Schneider et al. 2010
; Fritz and Koch 2014 ).

Instead, [[the unsustainable nature]{.mark} of contemporary capitalism
[opens up]{.mark} the urgency of working toward a new post-capitalist
era built on]{.underline} the following components: [[regulation]{.mark}
of market mechanisms and corporate activities; [support for]{.mark}
social enterprises organized as community [cooperatives; democratic
money creation]{.mark} processes,]{.underline} including [community
currencies, [in place of debt-based fractional reserve banking;]{.mark}
communities [reclaiming the commons]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially
[in]{.underline} the sense of [[communal land stewardship]{.mark}
systems; [redistribution of]{.mark} income and capital [assets; a
diversity of production]{.mark} scales and [modes]{.mark}, including
small-scale, subsistence and self- employment to widen economic
democracy]{.underline} (Johanisova and Wolf 2012 ).

[[Such a vision may]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the current context,
[[appear]{.mark} impossibly [utopian. By 2030]{.mark}, and even more so
by 2050---[as]{.mark} the manifestations of [global capitalism's
self-catabolic trajectory become]{.mark} more [obvious---**it will
appear**]{.mark} **increasingly [realistic.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Collapse of industrial society is inevitable\-\--forcing a transition is key to avoid a total collapse that ends civilization

Nafeez M. **Ahmed 17**, Executive Director of the Institute for Policy
Research and Development, *Failing States, Collapsing Systems:
BioPhysical Triggers of Political Violence*, 2017, pp. 11-13

Today, [human civilization under]{.underline} late [[capitalism
maintains]{.mark} its **increasing [distance from thermodynamic
equilibrium]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[via]{.mark} the [throughput
of]{.mark} vast quantities of]{.underline} increasingly depleted
[[fossil fuel reserves]{.mark}, [along with]{.mark}]{.underline} other
finite and increasingly scarce resources such as **[[metal
ores]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[radionucleotides, [rare]{.mark} earth
[elements]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[phosphate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
fertilizer, **[arable [land]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[fresh [water]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Nekola et al. 2013).

One indicator of the system's growing complexity today is the measure of
material throughput, or economic growth---Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Under capitalist social-property relations, GDP must continuously
increase through the maximization of private sector profits, simply for
businesses to survive in the competitive marketplace and for the economy
to maintain its ability to meet the consumption requirements of a
growing population. However, [as the complexity of human civilization
has advanced]{.underline}, the [continual growth in]{.underline}
material [throughput is correlated with an escalating rate of
**depletion of energy and raw materials**]{.underline}, as well as an
acceleration in the dissipation of energy through intensifying
greenhouse gas emissions.

Robust scientific assessments now demonstrate that [the continuation of
[those]{.mark} biophysical [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} of
environmental degradation in a business-as-usual scenario
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, before the end of the twenty-first century,
**[[fundamentally undermine]{.mark} the biophysical basis of [human
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}** in its current mode of material
organization and structural complexity. Further, the [[uncontrolled
energy releases]{.mark} generated by these]{.underline} biophysical
[processes [are manifested in **climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[extreme weather]{.underline}** events, [[and]{.underline} **[natural
disasters]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Earth System Disruption); [[and drives
**geopolitical**]{.mark} **[competition]{.mark}**, **social
[unrest]{.mark}**[, and **violent conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Human
System Destabilization).

These manifestations of dissipative energy release can be seen as
distinctive feedback processes resulting from human civilization's
accelerating exploitation of fossil fuel energy sources within the
context of the biophysical limits of the environment. In turn, these two
strands of systemic feedbacks---Earth System Disruption (ESD) and Human
System Destabilization (HSD)---are occurring within a single,
overarching human-environment system, and thus are already inherently
interconnected, therefore feeding back into each other.

This mutual feedback process creates an amplifying [global systemic
feedback]{.underline} in which: (1) ESD drives HSD, which in turn
generates 'security' issues perceived through the lens of 'threat' and
'risk' analysis; (2) this [invites traditional securitized human
responses]{.underline} that focus on the expansion of existing military,
political and economic power to stabilize existing structures of
authority and advance prevailing mechanisms of energy extraction and
mobilization; (3) the entrenchment and expansion of existing structures
undermines human civilization's capacity to pursue structural
modifications to ameliorate, mitigate or prevent ESD, thus intensifying
ESD; (4) the feedback process continues as ESD drives further HSD.

[The trajectory of this amplifying global systemic
feedback]{.underline}, carried to its logical conclusion and assuming no
intervening shift, [is simply the **protracted, cascading collapse of
human civilization**]{.underline} in its current form [toward
increasingly less complex, and therefore less resource-intensive
configurations]{.underline}, corresponding to available resources and
constrained within the environmental limits imposed by accelerating
climate change (Tainter 1990).

Within this amplifying global systemic feedback, one fundamental
obstacle to the systemic restructuring required to avert this outcome is
knowledge access, distribution, and processing. In much the same way
that an integral factor in an organism's capacity to adapt to changing
environmental conditions is its genetic ability to absorb environmental
information and process it through genetic modification that can result
in new adaptive biological configurations, human civilization must be
capable of absorbing and processing accurate information about the
human-environment system, and converting this into actionable knowledge,
in order to be empowered to enact the key structural modifications
capable of effecting a phase-shift to a more stable adaptive
configuration in relation to the Earth System.

The difference here, of course, is that while evolutionary biological
genetic modifi cation is a question of random mutations, human
civilization consists of a collection of conscious agents who can make
deliberative decisions on the basis of the information available to
them, which must be integrated into knowledge that is capable of
informing adaptive behaviors. This raises the question of a pivotal
system- wide structural defi ciency in the knowledge processing capacity
of human civilization. In short, inaccurate, misleading or partial
knowledge bears a particularly central role in cognitive failures
pertaining to the most powerful prevailing human political, economic and
cultural structures, which is inhibiting the adaptive structural
transformation urgently required to avert collapse. The most obvious
locus of this global systemic information defi cit is, of course, the
global media system--- or perhaps more accurately, the Global
Media-Industrial Complex (GMIC), and related organs of communication and
transnational information dissemination. The GMIC, in effect, currently
operates as the information-knowledge architecture of human
civilization.

The implications of this analysis are stark: scientific data
demonstrates that [the rapid [convergence of]{.mark} multiple [global
crisis]{.mark} in coming years and decades [is pushing]{.mark} a vast
array of [interconnected]{.mark} sub-[systems toward]{.mark} a
**threshold of [simultaneous tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From
a complex adaptive systems perspective, [[this]{.mark} feedback
threshold [signifies a]{.mark} global [system]{.mark} that is [on the
brink]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not in the midst, [[of a **fundamental
phase-shift**]{.underline}]{.mark} to a new structural configuration.

However, the evolutionary context of this process suggests that
[[the]{.mark} nature and [outcome of this]{.mark}]{.underline} global
civilizational [phase-[shift will **determine the**]{.mark} **ultimate
[fate of civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Rapidly [changing]{.mark}
environmental [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} and the escalating breach
of biophysical limits [[are compelling]{.mark} human [civilization to
either **adapt through**]{.mark} **fundamental [structural
reorganization]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} [face]{.mark} a
**[cascading and uncontrolled]{.mark} series of [structural
regressions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Growth depends on converting [low entropy]{.underline}, [highly organized]{.underline} systems into [high entropy]{.underline}, [more chaotic]{.underline} systems\-\--but energy is finite, so those processes are unsustainable and tech can't solve

To argue for PEG, neoliberal economists invoke the theoretical
fundamentals of neoclassical macroeconomic models. That is, PEG promotes
growth of gross domestic product (GDP) through an unfettered expansion
of an economy's productive capacity within [[the
biosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is finite, non]{.mark}-growing,
materially closed]{.underline} (except for the constant input of solar
energy), [[and constrained by]{.mark} the laws of
[thermodynamics]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 1). Note that a closed
system is one in which matter neither enters nor exits, but energy
enters as low entropy (high quality) and exits as high entropy (low
quality). It is this throughput of energy that powers the material
biogeochemical cycles on which life depends \[8-9\].

An economy is a socially constructed and legally and politically
mediated an open subsystem within the biosphere (Figure 1). To be
sustainable, it must be designed, organized, and function as a societal
living system in accordance with the ecological and social paradigm of
interconnectedness of living organisms. Sustainability of life on Earth
depends on the inflow of solar energy; and only living organisms are
capable of capturing, organizing, concentrating, and storing solar
energy in diverse forms necessary to support life on Earth.

Low entropy ([[high quali]{.mark}ty]{.underline}) [solar energy and
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with generated energy and human
capital and information embedded in machinery, equipment, and
information and communication technologies, [[flow from]{.mark} [the
biosphere through the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[open [economic
subsystem]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Figure 1). Subsequent to all
socioeconomic activities, [[high entropy]{.underline}]{.mark}, i.e.,
degraded and dissipating [energy and waste [material]{.mark} that
pollute the natural environment **[flow back]{.mark} to the
biosphere**]{.underline}. It might be possible to minimize the magnitude
of pollution, if effective policy for recovering, reusing, and recycling
(3Rs) is implemented. But, as the Second Law of Thermodynamics (aka
Entropy Law) teaches us, [most of the degraded material and energy
dissipates as waste during the economic processes
irrevocably]{.underline} \[9\].

Observe Figure 1 The sustainable level of energy throughput is a
function of the biosphere to sequester low entropy (useful) solar energy
and the capacity of the natural environment to absorb, detoxify, or
neutralize wastes. **[[Unsustainable]{.mark} economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the PEG, can be compared to growth of a
malignant cancer, because it [**[devours its own support
system]{.mark}**, the Earth's ecosystem services]{.underline} (Table 1).
Like an animal does, [[the economy lives on devouring]{.mark} all [low
entropy]{.mark}]{.underline} (useful energy contents) [natural capital
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[such as fish, timbe]{.mark}r, arable
[land, water]{.mark}, metals [and minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
fossil fuels, given back waste materials. This outcome, of course,
diminishes the productive, regenerative, absorptive, decompositive, and
assimilative capacities of the biosphere. Many fear that unless
overexploitation of natural resources is checked, [[modern civilization
will]{.underline}]{.mark} follow the path of ancient civilizations that
**[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**d because they overexploited their
natural resources \[3,9\].

A bit more elaboration on the physics of the First and the Second laws
of thermodynamics is warranted. According to the First Law of
Thermodynamics, also referred to as the Law of Energy/Material
Conservation, material inputs to economic processes are not "consumed",
because they return as wastes to the natural environment from where they
were extracted. This means that, during a physical or chemical change,
energy is neither created nor destroyed, although it may change from one
form to another; and it may move from one place to another. When one
form of energy is converted to another form in any physical or chemical
change process, energy input equals energy output- we cannot get
something for nothing is the dictum.

By contrast, [the Second Law of Thermodynamics states]{.underline} that
[with each change in a form of energy some energy is **degraded to a
less useful form**]{.underline} and given off to the surroundings,
usually as low quality heat. That is, in the process of performing work,
low entropy energy is converted into high entropy, which is waste energy
characterized by dispersed, dissipated, and molecularly chaotic state.
[This is]{.underline} an index of [irrevocably dissipated
energy]{.underline} \[9\].

Economic implications of the Second Law, however, are far subtle and are
very important. [[Economic processes utilize low entropy]{.mark} energy
and raw [materials]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., fossil fuels and high
grade metal ores) [[and]{.mark} [discard high entropy
wastes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} process **[imposes
constraints on]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is,
[anthropocentric economic processes transform valuable]{.underline} (low
entropy) [matter and energy into **irrevocable waste**]{.underline}. For
example, when coal is burned to generate electricity, only about 35% of
the total energy embedded in the coal is converted into electrical
energy, the rest becoming waste heat, various gases (e.g., CO2 ),
various chemicals, such as sulfuric acid, particulates, and ash; and
even the electricity dissipates into the natural environment as waste
heat once it has done its job \[14\]. The physicist may argue that the
"books are balanced" - there is just as much matter and energy in the
overall system as before in accordance with the First Law of
Thermodynamics. But, the Second Law refutes The First: whatever remains
is very significantly lower in quality. The upshot is that for every
unit of good product that a human being creates, using a given
technology, he manufactures two units of bad product - and even
usefulness of the good product is ephemeral \[14\]. In short, [[the idea
that]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology [will allow us to do]{.mark} ever
[more]{.mark} with ever less in perpetuity [is a
**delusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Minerals are declining and energy returns are diminishing\-\--that causes unsustainable feedback loops\-\--winning [one warrant]{.underline} for unsustainability is enough to us to win the debate

things from late 2016\]

There are several reasons why efficiency gains, in the real world, are
likely to be far less than factor-five. First, [[optimistic
claims]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[overlook]{.mark} the implications
of [ongoing depletion]{.mark} of non-renewable resources]{.underline}.
As the most easily accessible resource deposits are produced first,
[later [deposits]{.mark} tend to [require **increasing time, energy and
money**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to discover and extract]{.underline}.
Whereas, for example, only 2% of new oil discoveries in 1990 were
located in ultra-deep-water locations, by 2005 this had risen to 60%
(Murphy & Hall, 2011). With respect to fossil fuels, [this trend is
reflected in the declining energy return on energy invested]{.underline}
(EROI). Between 1995 and 2006 the global average EROI for oil and gas
declined from an estimated 30:1 to 18:1 (Hall et al., 2014; Murphy,
2010), with average EROI of US oil production falling to 11:1 (Murphy,
2014). Further decline in EROI is expected in coming decades, given the
increasing reliance of the global economy on non-conventional, low EROI,
sources of oil and gas supply (Hall et al., 2014).18 What this means is
that **[[even if there]{.mark} [are efficiency
gains]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}, say,
[[manufacturing]{.mark} processes, to some extent [they will be taken
back by **efficiency loses in**]{.mark} **resource
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This situation evokes the challenge
faced by the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, who
has to run faster and faster simply to stay in the same place (Likvern,
2012).

The impact of [[depletion is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[evident]{.underline}]{.mark} in the mining sector [[with **declining
mineral ore grades**]{.mark} and increasing mining waste rock and
tailings evident]{.underline}, both in Australia and globally,
[resulting in higher energy, water and emission costs]{.underline} for
mining and ore separation (Mudd, 2009; Deideren, 2015). Often overlooked
is the fact, as Deideren notes, that [[fossil-fuel and mineral depletion
will]{.mark} [compound]{.mark} each other [in a]{.mark}
**self-reinforcing [feedback loop]{.mark}**]{.underline} i.e. [[more
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} is [required [to extract lower grade mineral
ores]{.mark}]{.underline} which [will exacerbate energy
depletion]{.underline}, and this, in turn, will exacerbate minerals
depletion given the 'huge amounts of main and ancillary equipment and
consumables needed for mining' (Deideren, 2015, 9). These [geological
trends]{.underline}, which [are]{.underline} essentially **[[beyond
the]{.mark} [control of policy-makers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, are likely
to result in reduced resource efficiency in the extractive sector --
which will function to offset at least part of the efficiency gains made
across the rest of the economy.

Furthermore, optimistic efficiency projections often fail to factor in
the likelihood of diminishing returns over time. For any given
technology, it is often quite easy to make dramatic efficiency
improvements initially. However, [once the low hanging
fruit]{.underline}, so to speak, [has been picked, technical improvement
becomes more difficult and delivers **diminishing marginal
returns**]{.underline}. Ayres (2009) notes that for many decades there
have been plateaus for the efficiency of production of electricity and
fuels, electric motors, ammonia, iron and steel production. Given this,
while large increases are no doubt possible in certain areas, this does
not imply that rapid, large and continuous technical gains can easily be
made across all sectors of the economy.

Finally, potential efficiency gains often overlook the impact of rebound
effects whereby efficiency improvements are partially or wholly negated
by consumption growth enabled by the efficiency improvements themselves
(Herring et al., 2009; Sorrell; 2007). For example, a 5% increase in car
fuel efficiency may only reduce net fuel consumption by 2%, if the
efficiency improvements incentivise people, either directly or
indirectly, to act in more energy intensive ways. Directly, this occurs
if fuel efficiency reduces the running costs of a car and those reduced
costs result in more frequent driving or greater driving distances.
Indirectly, it occurs via the savings from improved fuel efficiency
being spent on alternative high-consumption activities. Backfire
effects, where efficiency improvements lead to increase rather than
decrease in overall resource or energy use, can have even more profound
implications (Alcott, 2005).

Some of these confounding factors may be mitigated by the financial
incentives induced by the high carbon price in Stretch, but the
efficiency improvements that might be realised in practice are
nonetheless subject to high levels of uncertainty. While the study
asserts that efficiency improvements of 4.5% are achievable, it does not
demonstrate that this is the case. The ANO study has shown that if
certain conditions are met, positive environmental outcomes may result,
but this is quite distinct from establishing a plausible case that those
conditions can be met. We argue that the uncertainties entailed here are
such that the likelihood of such an outcome cannot be established, and
that this should be reflected in the conclusions drawn from the
modelling exercise.

The ANO authors conclude by stating: 'we find that substantial economic
and physical decoupling is possible' (2015a; 49). Such a conclusion,
though, does not appear to us to be consistent with the nature of the
study. On our interpretation, what the study finds is the model outcome
that results when certain assumptions about resource use efficiency
improvement, carbon price, CCS, etc. are extrapolated out to 2050. In
other words, the study finds the consequences of those assumptions, not
that those assumptions are necessarily or definitively realistic or
achievable. As such, the authors clearly have not found that
sustainability and growth are compatible in practice -- that is, outside
the context of the 'model world' that they have constructed. It is very
important to bear this in mind in understanding the study's
significance.19

3.6 Sustainability beyond 2050

We conclude now with a point the ANO Report avoids. What happens after
2050? Even if the Stretch scenario turns out to be achievable, there are
several reasons why the world as a whole would not be on a long-term
sustainable path. Consider the following points:

• A major study on global decoupling potential (Schandl, 2015), which
was a key source for the ANO study, and used the same carbon price
assumptions, found that even the high abatement scenario (equivalent to
Stretch), would not achieve absolute decoupling in critical domains. The
study found that 'while relative decoupling can be achieved in some
scenarios, none would lead to an absolute reduction in energy or
materials footprint' (2015: 49).

• And yet, beyond 2050, Australia (and the world) would still have a
growth economy. Ward et al. (2016) have shown that, if you extrapolate
the economic growth rate in Stretch out to 2100 the Australian economy
would by then be 7.7 times its 2015 level. Given a very generous
assumption that a further 50% efficiency improvement can be achieved
beyond 2050, they calculate that 'material extractions and final energy
demand are up 29% and 256% respectively on 2015 levels' (Ward et al.,
2016). In other words, the environmental reductions made over the
scenario timeframe would by 2100 be eliminated. They conclude that this
demonstrates 'categorically that GDP growth cannot be sustained
indefinitely' (Ward et al., 2016: 10)

• After 2050 the carbon-planting scheme will be declining in
effectiveness, every year, as a carbon sink. Combined with the fact that
by 2050, if not well before, fossil fuel supply will be in decline (Mohr
et al., 2015), this will necessitate a difficult and costly transition
to mostly, if not entirely, renewable energy supply (Stram, 2016;
Trainer; 2014; Mediavilla et al., 2013). As discussed above, this
difficulty would be compounded by severely limited bio-fuel potential,
given competing land demands (Canadell et al., 2013).

• Globally, by 2050 world energy consumption would have risen to double
present levels, inevitably placing more pressure on dwindling resource
supplies and the planet's already stressed ecological systems. By then
**[[biodiversity]{.mark} [loss]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[soil
degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[ocean
acidification]{.underline}**, **[[fish depletion]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[chemical pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [among other already
existing problems [would]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely [[be
exacerbated as a result of]{.mark} the **decades of [economic
expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and extraction]{.underline} (WWF,
2016; Rockström et al., 2009).

• And yet, according to the ANO Report, in 2050 there would be at least
5+ billion people still to be integrated into the ever expanding
'consumer class.'

Jorgan Randers (2012), one of the original authors of the Limits to
Growth report (Meadows et al., 1972), does not think humanity will run
into critical limits by 2050. But by about 2070 he thinks the situation
will have become catastrophic. The point is that [[the exact timing
of]{.mark} when we hit [ecological limits is **not
critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[What **is
critical**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is that]{.mark} at some point in the
foreseeable future **[they will be hit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [if the
world's economies remain driven by the endless pursuit of
growth]{.underline}. At best the ANO Report provides some reason to
think that limits will be felt later rather than sooner, but it does not
give us any good reason to think we will not eventually hit them. To the
extent the decoupling strategy fails, it is [this **growth paradigm
itself**]{.underline} that [is the ultimate cause of the ecological
crisis]{.underline}. Our argument is not that the attempt to decouple
economic activity from environmental impact is misplaced. Our argument
is simply that the decoupling strategy cannot make the global growth
paradigm sustainable. Given the fundamental nature of any transition
'beyond growth', this needs immediate, dedicated attention.

4\. Conclusion

The ANO Report, published by Australia's most prestigious scientific
body, the CSIRO, claims Australia can continue to grow its economy in
terms of GDP, and that it can do this without degrading the environment
in unsustainable ways. Similarly, in the Nature article based on the ANO
Report, the authors claim that Australia is 'free to choose' economic
growth and sustainability. They even insist that achieving sustainable
outcomes does not require questioning consumerist social values. Given
the status and credibility that typically attach to CSIRO and
peer-reviewed Nature publications, most people, including politicians,
can be expected to take the 'pro-growth' CSIRO conclusions at face value
as sound.

In this paper we have provided a variety of reasons why the ANO Report,
and by implication the Nature article, have drawn key conclusions that
have not been established by the modelling study on which they are
based. Our lines of critique have focussed on the unacceptable social
justice implications of the work; its misconceived carbon budget
assumptions; its extraordinary proposal to plant up two thirds of
Australia's best agriculture land with carbon sequestering plants,
without presenting a convincing case for how to achieve this; its deep
reliance on CCS technology which to date is not commercially viable; its
[highly [optimistic assumptions]{.mark} about resource]{.underline}
efficiency [improvements]{.underline}; and the fact that its claims
about 'sustainability' only extend to 2050. We note also that the report
[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}s [that there will be [no resource
scarcity]{.mark} challenges that interfere with this long-term vision of
economic growth]{.underline}. **[[If any one of these assumptions turns
out]{.mark} to be misconceived or [unachievable]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[the vision of '[sustainable prosperity]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}
defended in the report **[[will not]{.mark}
[eventuate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our paper has presented grounds for
doubting all of their assumptions, such that cumulatively the report's
conclusions must be considered, at best, not established, and, on
balance, mostly likely false. Indeed, even if the report's most
ambitious Stretch scenario were somehow achieved by 2050, we have shown
that by no means would a growth-orientated Australia or a
growth-orientated world be on a sustainable path.

If this broad critique is correct, the implications are profound:
[humanity must face up to the fact that **the dominant macroeconomics of
growth are unsustainable**]{.underline}. With specific reference to the
most developed regions of the world, acknowledging that [there are
environmental limits to growth]{.underline} would be the first step in
making the fundamental transition 'beyond growth'. Indeed, [given the
extent of ecological overshoot]{.underline}, the likelihood of future
population growth, and the need for the poorest nations to develop their
economic capacities in some form, it would seem that [any coherent
transition to a 'one planet' global economy will require the developed
or overdeveloped nations]{.underline} not just [moving to]{.underline} a
non-growing economy but actively initiating a policy of planned
**[economic contraction]{.underline}**, or degrowth.

Obviously a degrowth policy framework raises enormous problems and
issues which are beyond the scope of this paper, but which are beginning
to be addressed by critical scholars and activist communities across the
globe (see generally, D'Alisa, Demaria, and Kallis, 2015). To summarise
briefly, it would involve a planned economic contraction and
reorganisation of developed economies, so as to achieve the long-term
reductions needed, as well as provide space for development of the
poorest nations and room for biodiversity to flourish, whilst also
meeting the needs of all people for meaningful, healthy and productive
livelihoods. While the main focus of a degrowth strategy would be to
reduce environmental impact to [[sustainable
levels]{.underline},]{.mark} the above analysis suggests this [[cannot
be done without a]{.mark} **[contraction of wealth]{.mark} and income**
for global rich and middle class]{.underline} -- that is, such a goal
would not be compatible with ever-increasing GDP or consumerist values
or lifestyles, as is taken for granted by the decoupling strategy. We
realise that such a solution is far outside the scope of real-world
politics today, but that only sets the challenge for civil-society
groups across the planet. In our view, no other large-scale
sustainability vision and strategy adequately responds to the true
nature of the global predicament. It is imperative that sustainability
scholars and activists give more attention to the need for such a
radical shift in vision and policy agenda.

#### [Innovation]{.underline} and [returns on investment]{.underline} are declining\-\--that crushes the [material foundations]{.underline} of civilization unless consumption dramatically decreases

Christopher **Ketcham 17**, writer for the Pacific Standard, among other
publications, citing Joseph Tainter, a professor of sustainability at
Utah State University, "The Fallacy of Endless Economic Growth,"
5/16/17, https://psmag.com/magazine/fallacy-of-endless-growth

Now, [at the very moment that we need innovation to
accelerate]{.underline}---to mount a viable response to climate change,
to locate new resources and replace dwindling or despoiled
ones---**[evidence suggests that the opposite is
happening]{.underline}**. Joseph Tainter, a professor of sustainability
at Utah State University, examined innovation trends using 30 years of
data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. What he found was
troubling. Slightly more than half of all patents issued in this country
are to foreign entities, so Tainter considered changes to the number of
patents per applicant to be an accurate indicator of global productivity
as expressed through invention. [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[major]{.mark} technical [fields]{.mark}]{.underline} he
studied---[[drugs]{.underline}]{.mark} and chemicals,
[[metallurgy]{.underline}, [energy, biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology,
[information]{.underline} technology, [and so on]{.underline}---he found
that [[the]{.mark} number of [researchers on each]{.mark} [patent
**steadily increased**]{.mark}]{.underline} between 1974 and 2005.
**[[This means more]{.mark} [time and]{.mark}
man-hours]{.underline}**---[and presumably **more [money]{.mark}
invested**]{.underline}---[[for a declining return]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In his 1988 book The Collapse of Complex Societies---a kind of companion
volume to Limits---Tainter makes the case that [[as civilizations grow
they]{.mark} [produce]{.mark} [**increasingly complex problems** that
demand]{.mark} **increasingly [complex solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Complexity demands more]{.mark} [energy]{.mark}, requiring new
technologies]{.underline} for energy extraction. But, as Tainter\'s
study suggests, innovation may have its own limits.

The concept of [[energy-return]{.mark}-on-investment]{.underline}, known
as EROI, was originally coined in reference to fossil-fuel exploration,
and is commonly used to compare the amount of energy required to
extract, transport, and refine a particular resource with the amount of
energy it ultimately provides. EROI [for our master energy source
[happens to be]{.mark} **[plummeting]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as
discovery and extraction of fossil fuels becomes more difficult and
costly]{.underline}. (The rising cost---which is to say complexity---of
resource extraction and retrieval was one of Limits\' broad projections
that also turned out to be accurate.) EROI for global oil and gas
production went from 30-to-1 in 1995 to 18-to-1 in 2006. In the U.S.,
the EROI for oil discovery in 1919 was an astonishing 1,000-to-1. By the
2010s, it was 5-to-1.

[[In mining]{.mark}, multifactor
[productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}---which reflects the efficiency with
which the inputs of capital, labor, materials, services, and energy
generate a unit of mineral product---[[has]{.mark} [been on a downward
slope]{.mark} since 2002]{.underline}. According to the Australian
Bureau of Statistics, [[it]{.mark} now [takes **40 percent more
inputs**]{.mark} [to dig up minerals]{.mark} in general]{.underline},
[while the grain sizes and ore grades of what\'s being retrieved are
declining]{.underline}. The Journal of Environmental Science and
Engineering reported in 2013 that, \"[under the present paradigm of
use,]{.underline}\" [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}, within decades,
[[will]{.mark} begin [see]{.mark}ing \"[scarcity\" of]{.mark} \"most of
the strategically important [metals and materials]{.mark} that are
**[fundamental to]{.mark} \[the\] running of [our]{.mark}
[societies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" According to the study\'s lead
authors, a chemical engineering professor at Lund University in Sweden
and an applied systems analyst at Stockholm University,
\"**[[scarcity]{.mark} [may lead \[to\] \'peak
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\' [[unless]{.mark} urgent
[countermeasures]{.mark} [are **systematically
undertaken**]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"

Even in the midst of substantial innovation, today\'s global economy has
become more profligate and more wasteful, using more materials per unit
of GDP than it did 20 years ago. According to a 2016 report from the
International Resource Panel at the United Nations Environment
Programme, [the amount of]{.underline} virgin [natural resource needed
for a given amount of product has gone up 17 percent over a single
decade]{.underline}. In 2000, it took an average 1.2 kilograms of
materials to generate one dollar of global GDP. By 2010, it took 1.4
kilograms. The amount of primary materials extracted from the Earth
globally rose from 22 billion tonnes in 1970 to 70 billion tonnes in
2010, with per capita global material use going from seven tonnes in
1970 to 10 tonnes over the same 40-year period. According to the report,
[there is \"growing environmental pressure per unit of economic
activity,\" not less]{.underline}.

Optimists will undoubtedly look to renewable energy as a stay against
declining EROI and rising seas. But they may be blindsided by the stark
limits of wind, solar, and hydro. Researchers at Monash University,
marshaling considerable data, concluded that the [[cheerful
scenarios]{.mark} projecting renewables will supply most of the world\'s
energy by mid-century \"[assume **unrealistic**]{.mark} **technical
[potentials and]{.mark} [implementation times]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"
Which means we\'ll be stuck mostly with fossil fuels to keep the
expansion machine running. Tim Jackson of the University of Surrey has
calculated that, [at current rates of carbon density]{.underline}---the
amount of carbon released per unit of energy
consumed---[our]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions will increase by
more than 2 percent per year]{.underline}. At that rate, by 2050 carbon
dioxide emissions would be more than double what they were in 2015. [To
achieve a tenfold reduction in global emissions by 2050]{.underline},
[carbon density would have to decline]{.underline} on average 8.6
percent annually---almost **[10 times the rate at which it has declined
over the last 50 years]{.underline}** [and **50 times faster** than in
the past decade]{.underline}. In other words, we would have to innovate
carbon-reduction strategies at rates never before seen, with
technologies of immense effectiveness whose global-scale implementation
would be entirely unprecedented.

### AT: Technology/Renewables/CCS

#### Degrowth key\-\--technological innovation is too slow, leads to rebound effects and isn't sufficient to stop climate change

John **Wiseman 17**, Professorial Research Fellow at the Melbourne
Sustainable Society Institute and with the Climate and Energy College,
University of Melbourne, Adjunct Professor at the Melbourne School of
Population and Global Health, Research Fellow at the Centre for Policy
Development and Climate Change Policy Adviser, Sustainability Victoria,
Ph.D. from Latrobe University, Samuel Alexander, lecturer with the
Office for Environmental Programs, University of Melbourne, and research
fellow, Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, 2017, "The Degrowth
Imperative: Reducing Energy and Resource Consumption as an Essential
Component in Achieving Carbon Budget Targets," in Transitioning to a
Post-Carbon Society, p. 95-97

[The]{.underline} first [heroic assumption underpinning techno-optimist
solutions is the ongoing reliance]{.underline} in many of the most
influential large scale [decarbonization strategies on CCS]{.underline}
(carbon capture and storage). While CCS may play a valuable, albeit
modest, long term role, [the current state of knowledge suggests that
**[we are]{.mark} still [a]{.mark} very [long way from]{.mark}
affordable and [scalable CCS]{.mark} deployment**]{.underline}. [Even
the Global CCS Institute]{.underline} (2013: 5) [has recently reported
that, "while CCS projects are progressing, the pace is well below the
level required for CCS to make substantial contribution to climate
change mitigation]{.underline}". The growing "emissions gap" is also
providing increasing impetus for speculation about the "necessity" of
geoengineering "solutions" with all their attendant concerns about
ethical implications and unintended consequences (see Hamilton 2013).

[The second debatable assumption is that technological innovation will
necessarily and rapidly translate into global reductions]{.underline} in
energy consumption. [Important **[questions remain about]{.mark} the
[speed with which 100% renewable energy can realistically be
achieved]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see e.g. Smil 2010, 2014); [the extent
of fossil fuel energy consumption required to drive the initial massive
expansion in renewable energy infrastructure; and the full life cycle
energy return on investment (EROI)]{.underline} outcomes of solar and
wind energy---[particularly if these calculations factor in the full
costs of energy storage]{.underline} (see e.g. Palmer 2013; Prieto and
Hall 2013). Noting that emissions reductions of 4% p.a. in an economy
growing at 2% p.a. are likely to require carbon intensity improvements
of around 6% p.a., Anderson (2013) notes that he has yet to find any
credible mainstream economist prepared to argue that prolonged emissions
reductions of 3% or 4% or more are compatible with economic growth.

Indeed, as Lord Stern (2006: 231) himself has noted: [[There is]{.mark}
likely to be a **[maximum practical rate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at
which]{.mark} global [emissions can be reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
the national level, [[there are examples of]{.mark} sustained emissions
[cuts]{.mark} of [up to 1% per year]{.mark}]{.underline} associated with
structural change in energy systems\... whilst maintaining strong
economic growth. However, [[cuts]{.mark} in emissions [greater than this
have]{.mark} historically [been associated **only** with]{.mark}
economic [recession]{.mark} or upheaval]{.underline}, for example, the
emissions reduction of 5.2% per year for a decade associated with the
economic transition and strong reduction in output in the former Soviet
Union. [These magnitudes of cuts suggest it is likely to be **very
challenging to reduce emissions** by more than a few percent per year
while maintaining strong economic growth]{.underline}.

[The third reason for caution in assuming overly optimistic
relationships between technological innovation,]{.underline} carbon
intensity and emissions reductions [is the impact of the "[rebound
effect]{.mark}"]{.underline} (see Jevons 1865; Herring and Sorrell 2009;
Holm and Englund 2009; Jackson 2009). [This]{.underline} phenomenon
[refers to the tendency for innovation and efficiency gains to be
**rapidly [overwhelm]{.mark}ed**]{.underline} [as cheaper]{.underline}
unit costs combined with the formidable reach and power of the global
advertising industry enable [[and encourage]{.mark} [individuals to
**consume more**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the same or alternative
services and products.]{.underline} [The harsh reality remains that
global [emissions continue to grow]{.mark}]{.underline} (IPCC
2013)---along with the global trends in the consumption of energy and
resources---[[with]{.mark} apparent [improvements in]{.mark} developed
economy energy [efficiency]{.mark} often **[masking the reality
of]{.mark} energy intensive [production being offshored]{.mark} to
developing economies**]{.underline}.

The [[likelihood of]{.mark} full and [fast deployment]{.mark} of new
technologies [is]{.mark} the fourth [problematic]{.mark}
assumption]{.underline} that needs to be addressed [[given]{.mark} the
**formidable [political and social obstacles]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[standing in the way of rapid implementation]{.underline}. As noted in
the recent Post Carbon Pathways review of learning from the
implementation of large-scale decarbonization strategies (see Wiseman et
al. 2013), [experienced climate scientists and policymakers consistently
come to the conclusion that the key obstacles standing in the way of
rapid decarbonization are political and social rather than
technological]{.underline}. Key roadblocks include the following.

#### Rebound effect captures [at least 50%]{.underline} of efficiency savings\-\--empirically proven 

Ryan **Gunderson 17**, Ph.D. in Sociology with Specializations in
Environmental Science and Policy from Michigan State University,
Assistant Professor in Department of Sociology and Gerontology at Miami
University, et al., 2/15/17, "South Korean green growth and the Jevons
paradox: An assessment with democratic and degrowth policy
recommendations," Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 144, p. 242

[The **Jevons paradox** refers to the commonly found association between
increased production and consumption of resources **despite improved
efficiency**]{.underline} (reduced resource use per economic unit)
(resource use here refers to raw materials and ecosystems used for
production/consumption and/or waste sinks). The paradox is named after
the economist William Stanley Jevons (1865) for his observation that the
increased efficiency of coal-powered steam engines increased total coal
consumption (Clark and Foster, 2001). [It is a paradoxical correlation
as one would reasonably assume that improved efficiency will decrease
total resource use because fewer resources are used per economic
unit.]{.underline} Indeed, [green [tech]{.mark}nologies [that
improve]{.mark} energy and electricity [efficiency are]{.mark} often
[pointed to as]{.mark} **primary [solutions]{.mark}** to the
**environmental crisis**]{.underline} for this reason, the NSGG being
one example. A "rebound effect" is often used as a synonym for the
Jevons paradox.3 A rebound effect is when the benefits of efficiency
gains are partially "consumed" by increases in resource use due to
improvements in efficiency (Santarius, 2012). [[There are]{.mark}
different levels of [rebound effects]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 0 percent
rebound effect (i.e., no rebound effect) means that there was a full
realization of resource use reductions due to improved efficiency.
Rebound effects above 100 percent are termed "backfire effects" or
"backfires," which means total resource use is higher after the improved
efficiency was implemented due to improvements in efficiency.¶ [Although
the causes of the Jevons paradox]{.underline}, which cannot be
summarized here, [are unclear and likely more numerous and complex than
the commonly proposed direct mechanisms]{.underline} (e.g., improved
efficiency reduces prices, thereby stimulating more resource use) and
indirect mechanisms (e.g., money saved due to efficiency gains is spent
on other forms of resource use) (Santarius, 2012, York and McGee, 2016),
[[it is clear]{.mark} that the [association between]{.mark} improved
[efficiency and increased]{.mark} resource [use is]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[found in many contexts]{.mark} and at various scales]{.underline}**
(from household to global levels) (e.g., Bunker, 1996, Alcott, 2005,
Greening et al., 2000, Foster et al., 2010, Holm and Englund, 2009,
Polimini et al., 2008, Sorrell, 2007, York, 2009, York, 2010, York et
al., 2009, York et al., 2011, York and McGee, 2016). This does not mean
that more than all of the benefits of efficiency gains will be consumed
due only to rebound effects. [Integrating meta-analyses of research on
rebound effects]{.underline}, Santarius (2012, p. 15) argues for [a
"fifty-fifty rule of thumb," meaning that **[increased]{.mark} resource
[use]{.mark} due to improved efficiency [will offset at least half
of]{.mark} the technically [possible savings]{.mark}** of improved
efficiency.]{.underline} [The underlying paradox is that total resource
use increases despite efficiency gains, partially due to]{.underline}
**[rebound effects following efficiency gains]{.underline}**. To provide
only a few examples: [[between]{.mark} 19[70 and]{.mark} 19[91]{.mark},
the US and six European [countries improved]{.mark} energy
[efficiency]{.mark} by [30 percent while]{.mark} energy [consumption
rose]{.mark} by [20]{.mark} percent]{.underline} (Holm and Englund,
2009); [[nations with higher]{.mark} levels of [efficiency]{.mark}
generally [have higher]{.mark} rates of carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}, electricity consumption, and energy use]{.underline}
(York and McGee, 2016); [improved carbon or energy efficiency is
generally associated with increases in total energy use at a
macro-economic level]{.underline} (York, 2006, York, 2010, York et al.,
2009, Jorgenson, 2009); increases in energy efficiency in South Korea
prior to the implementation of the NSGG, due to a switch in energy
sources to nuclear and natural gas, led to macro-level rebound effects
of 38 percent (short-term) and 30 percent (long-term) in electricity
consumption of and a rebound effect of 50--70 percent for air
conditioners (micro-level) (Jin, 2007); [[and the recent]{.mark} history
of the [world]{.mark} economy [has]{.mark} dramatically [improved
efficiency while **dramatically increasing**]{.mark} **absolute
[resource use]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bunker, 1996). The Jevons paradox
has detrimental implications for the NSGG.

### AT: Decoupling

#### Absolute decoupling is impossible because of efficiency limitations\-\--collapse now is better than waiting for nature to force transition

James D. **Ward 16**, Associate Professor at the School of Natural and
Built Environments at University of South Australia, Ph.D. in
environmental science from the Flinders University, et al., 10/14/16,
"Is Decoupling GDP Growth from Environmental Impact Possible?" Volume
11, Number 10, p. 1-14

The perpetually growing economy is generally regarded as a viable and
desirable societal objective \[1--4\]. [Whilst '**infinite growth'** may
not be the words used]{.underline} to characterize and exhort a
perpetually growing economy, [they are nonetheless]{.underline} an
[accurate]{.underline} characterization of the objective. The [words in
current fashion for defending the viability of a perpetually growing
economy are phrases such as '**green growth**]{.underline}'[,
'**dematerialization**]{.underline}'[, and '**decoupling**]{.underline}'
\[5--9\]. The decades old question 'Is economic growth environmentally
sustainable?' remains contested despite its apparent simplicity. The
Limits to Growth \[10\] was a seminal work that warned of the
consequences of exponential growth with finite resources. The World3
models underpinning the Limits to Growth analysis were validated using
actual data after twenty and thirty years \[11,12\]. A further
independent evaluation of the projections of the World3 models showed
that our actual trajectory since 1972 has closely matched the 'Business
as Usual' scenario \[13\]. Increasing recognition of the causes and
consequences of climate change have generated a great deal of doubt
regarding the feasibility of simultaneously pursing economic growth and
preventing and/or mitigating climate change \[14--18\]. [Contemporary
work in this broad area of assessing **anthropogenic
impact**]{.underline} [on the planet suggests that several 'Planetary
Boundaries' have been crossed]{.underline} \[19\].¶ The question as to
whether human society can decouple economic growth--defined as growth in
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)--from environmental impacts has not been
settled. The decoupling debate itself is polarized with a preponderance
of neo-classical economists on one side (decoupling is viable) and
ecological economists on the other (decoupling is not viable) \[20\].
The divide over the compatibility of economic growth and environms
sental limits extends into the general public \[2\] with substantial
polarization in ideas of decoupling, dematerialization, and limits to
growth.¶ Settling the debate has far reaching policy implications.
[Decoupling is increasingly being described in popular press as a viable
policy objective]{.underline} \[21,22\]. [Decoupling has been
incorporated into international indicators of sustainable
development]{.underline} \[23\] [and policy objectives]{.underline} such
as the United Nations' 'Sustainable Development Goals' \[24\]. If
decoupling is possible, then these policies are valid sustainable goals;
however, [if decoupling is shown to be **nonviable** then society will
need to shift away from the current 'infinite growth'
model]{.underline}.¶ [Decoupling is defined as either
'relative']{.underline} (aka 'weak') [or 'absolute']{.underline} (aka
'strong'). [Relative decoupling refers to higher rates of economic
growth than rates of growth in material and energy consumption and
environmental impact]{.underline}. As a result, relative decoupling
implies a gain in efficiency rather than removal of the link between
impact and GDP. Recent trends (1990 to 2012) for GDP \[25\], material
use \[26\] and energy use \[27\] in different countries and regions
exhibit different behavior (Fig 1). In China, relative decoupling has
occurred as GDP (market prices, in current US\$) increased by a factor
of more than 20 over the 22-year period, while energy use rose by a
factor of slightly more than four and material use by almost five.
Germany, meanwhile, exhibited slower GDP growth than China, but at the
same time reduced energy use by 10% and total material use by 40%. The
OECD follows a similar story to Germany, albeit with flat rather than
falling energy and material consumption. Although Germany and the OECD
give hope that absolute decoupling may be achievable, at the global
level we see only relative decoupling with energy and material use
increasing by 54% and 66% over the 22 years, respectively.¶ Similar
evidence to that in Fig 1, showing apparent decoupling of GDP from
specific resources, has been shown throughout much of the OECD \[28\].
However, [there are several limitations to the inference of decoupling
from national or regional data]{.underline}. [There are three distinct
[mechanisms by]{.mark} which the [illusion of decoupling may be
presented as]{.mark} a [reality]{.mark} when in fact it is not actually
taking place at all]{.underline}: [[1)]{.underline} **[substitution of
one resource for another]{.underline}**; [2)]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[**financialization** of]{.mark} one or more
[components]{.mark}]{.underline} of GDP that involves increasing
monetary flows without a concomitant rise in material and/or energy
throughput, [[and 3)]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[exporting]{.mark} of
[environmental impact]{.mark}** [to another nation]{.mark} or region of
the world]{.underline} (i.e. the separation of production and
consumption). These illusory forms of decoupling are described with
respect to energy by our colleague \[29\].¶ An additional mechanism of
decoupling is associated with growing inequality of income and wealth,
which can allow GDP to grow overall while the majority of workers do not
see a real gain in income \[30\]. This growth in inequality can manifest
as higher GDP without a proportional increase in material and energy
flow (i.e. relative decoupling) when a wealthy minority of the
population derives the largest fraction of GDP growth but does not
necessarily increase their level of consumption with as much demand for
energy and materials \[31\]. In such cases, at the aggregate level
decoupling would be observed, but it is doubtful that such unequal
sharing of growth in GDP represents an improvement in wellbeing.¶ At
[the World]{.underline} aggregate level, Fig 1 [shows relative
decoupling]{.underline} with a growing gap between GDP and resource
consumption. [In the context of]{.underline} reaching **[planetary
boundaries]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[global environmental
limits]{.underline}**, however, [[relative decoupling will be
**insufficient to maintain**]{.mark} **a GDP growth-oriented [human
civilization]{.mark}**. The only way to achieve truly sustainable growth
would be]{.underline} via permanent [absolute decoupling]{.underline}.
Absolute decoupling theoretically occurs when environmental impacts are
reduced while economic growth continues. While relative decoupling has
been observed in multiple countries, **[[absolute decoupling remains
elusive]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[32--34\]. According to one study \[35\]
[no country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50
years]{.underline}. Another study \[36\] reports that population growth
and increases in affluence are overwhelming efficiency improvements at
the global scale. They find no evidence for absolute reductions in
environmental impacts, and little evidence to date even for significant
relative decoupling.¶ It should be noted that [technological advances
can lead to absolute decoupling for specific types of
impact]{.underline} \[37\]. It is possible, for instance, to substitute
a polluting activity with a non-polluting activity, and notable examples
have included the removal of tetraethyl lead from automotive fuel and
CFCs from refrigerants and propellants. [It is also possible to envisage
a scenario in which GDP growth is decoupled from the use of fossil
fuels]{.underline} and related CO2 emissions [by switching to 100%
[renewable energy]{.mark}, but this [is not the same as
decoupling]{.mark} GDP [growth from energy use]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the context of this study, we are primarily interested in fundamental
resources (matter and energy) as the foundations of economic activity.¶
In the current paper, we show that decoupling scenarios can be
interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and
environmental impact. The simple model was calibrated against published
data derived from sophisticated predictive studies of decoupling, and
used to develop a long-term prognosis of environmental impact under
continued GDP growth. The results are then used to draw conclusions
about the long-term viability of GDP growth as a societal goal.¶ Model
Derivation¶ We use a simple mathematical model to develop insights into
decoupling behavior. We start with the IPAT equation \[38--40\], which
is a basic formulation of environmental impact I as a function of
economic activity:¶ (1)¶ where P is population, A is affluence (GDP per
capita in \$/person/year) and T, as originally formulated, represents
"technology". More precisely, however, T should be viewed as the
economic intensity of a particular resource or pollutant, and therefore
both T and I will have different units depending on which resource or
pollutant is considered. For energy, appropriate units for T may be
joules per \$ of GDP; for material use T may be kilograms per \$ of GDP.
The terms T and I can--and should--thus be evaluated separately, with
appropriate units, for individual resources such as farming land, fresh
water and energy resources, and/or pollutant emissions such as sulphur
dioxide, lead, or carbon dioxide.¶ To test the hypothesis that continual
GDP growth can be sustained, we only require a scenario in which GDP
increases exponentially. The economy (as GDP) can thus be simplified to
G = PA, leading to Ij = GTj where Ij and Tj are the impact and economic
intensity, respectively, of resource or pollutant j. A simple case is
one in which both population (P) and affluence (A) are increasing
exponentially, but other combinations (e.g. stationary population with
rising affluence) could achieve the same result of rising GDP. There
are, of course, scenarios that could lead to falling GDP (e.g. declining
population with constant affluence, or both falling) but our
investigation is directed explicitly at testing the sustainability of
continual economic growth as a societal goal. As such, we assume G at
time t is given by:¶ (2)¶ where G0 is the initial GDP at time t = 0, and
k is the growth rate per year. Hence, impact (for resource or pollutant
j) over time is given as:¶ (3)¶ If there is no technological change to
reduce a particular impact (i.e. Tj = constant; no decoupling), the use
of resources or pollutant emissions will rise exponentially, in keeping
with GDP growth. For absolute decoupling from resource or pollutant j,
Tj must decrease exponentially at the same rate as GDP growth such that
Ij remains constant in time, i.e.:¶ (4)¶ where Tj,0 is the initial level
of economic intensity of resource or pollutant j.¶ Put simply, absolute
decoupling from resource or pollutant j requires Tj to decrease by at
least the same annual percentage as the economy is growing. For example,
if k = 0.03 (steady 3% p.a. economic growth), Tj must reduce 20-fold
over 100 years, 100-fold over 150 years, and 500-fold over 200 years,
and continue this trend of exponential reduction as long as the economy
is growing. If Tj were to decrease at a faster rate than GDP growth, the
impact Ij would decline.¶ For non-substitutable resources such as land,
water, raw materials and energy, we argue that whilst efficiency gains
may be possible, there are minimum requirements for these resources that
are ultimately governed by physical realities: for instance the
photosynthetic limit to plant productivity and maximum trophic
conversion efficiencies for animal production govern the minimum land
required for agricultural output; physiological limits to crop water use
efficiency govern minimum agricultural water use, and the upper limits
to energy and material efficiencies govern minimum resource throughput
required for economic production. Therefore a more appropriate
formulation of Eq (4) is to allow Tj to decrease to an ultimate value,
Tult ≥ 0, as follows:¶ (5)¶ where Tj,ult is the ultimate resource use
intensity, and rj is the rate of exponential decline, for resource or
pollutant j. In cases where decoupling is occurring, Tj,ult \< Tj,0.
However, cases where resource use intensity is increasing towards an
upper limit can be accommodated with Tj,ult \> Tj,0.¶ The nature of
decoupling behavior for different types of resource can be readily
predicted from the relationships between rj, k, Tj,ult and Tj,0 as
summarized in Table 1. It is only those resources or pollutants for
which rj \> k and Tj,ult \< Tj,0 (i.e. efficiency gains are possible and
can be achieved faster than the economy is growing) that a period of
decoupling can be expected.¶ Model Application¶ A recent predictive
study \[41\] concluded that Australia could--through adoption of
specific policies--"achieve strong economic growth to 2050 ... in
scenarios where environmental pressures fall or are stable" (this study
is referred to as "H-D" hereafter). That paper summarized the results of
a significant project, the 2015 Australian National Outlook \[42\]
published by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO), and represents a high-profile, contemporary study
in decoupling. In all of their modelled scenarios, both population and
gross national income per capita increased. In their strong abatement
scenario (called "Stretch"), various forms of decoupling behavior were
predicted. We will use the Stretch scenario from H-D as a case study in
decoupling, and will use Eq (5) to further explore the behavior of
energy and material use and implications for longer-term impact. The
data used in H-D's historical and projected scenarios are all available
in their Supplementary Information files that accompanied their original
publication. Likewise, the data and model results for the following
analysis can all be found in the S1 File accompanying this paper.¶ We
begin by calibrating the decline rate rj from Eq (5) against H-D's
historical energy use (j = 1) and material extraction (j = 2). The term
Tj for each resource is found by dividing GDP (G) by resource use (Ij)
on a yearly timestep. For energy, units are MJ per thousand \$AUD
(2010). T1,0 = 3.783, equal to the value of T1 in the year 1980. The
ultimate resource use intensity T1,ult is unknown, and depends on future
technological advances. To account for this uncertainty, three scenarios
are adopted: high decoupling (T1,ult = 0.25 T1(2010) = 0.704), medium
decoupling (Tult = 0.5T1(2010) = 1.408) and low decoupling (Tult = 0.75
T1(2010) = 2.113). Under each of the three T1,ult scenarios, Eq (5) is
used to predict T1, and is calibrated by varying the single unknown
parameter (the decline rate, r1) to give the best fit between our T1
(predicted) and T1 (historical) derived from H-D's data. The calibration
was performed using the free statistical package "R"
(https://www.r-project.org) with the in-built Non-Linear Least Squares
function.¶ All three scenarios reproduce the observed downward trend in
T1. Calibrated declines rates with standard error (in brackets) were
1.24% (± 0.05%), 1.70% (± 0.07%) and 2.66% (± 0.13%) for high, medium
and low respectively. The result is a simple calibrated model that can
be used to project forward based on recent trends, for the purpose of
comparing against the more complex modelling scenarios from H-D. The
results are shown in Fig 2(A), with the modelled T1 values projected to
2050. The decoupling predicted by H-D is also shown (taking T1 as their
predicted impact divided by their predicted GDP). Clearly H-D predict
stronger decoupling than our strongest case. In terms of the simplified
IPAT model, even for our most optimistic T1,ult scenario, this implies a
change to a greater decline rate than can be obtained merely by
calibrating against historical trends.¶ In the case of material
extraction, T2 has been increasing over recent years; in other words,
according to H-D's historical data, material use has not been on a
decoupling trajectory in Australia. This is not unexpected, reflecting
Australia's strong dependence on its extractive industries. However, it
means that in order to obtain a good fit to historical data, T2,ult must
be greater than T2,0. The units of T2 are tonnes of material extracted
per thousand \$AUD (2010), and T2,0 = 1.091 in the year 1980. Three
scenarios are adopted as an upper bound to future material intensity:
low (T2,ult = 1.25T2(2010) = 1.513), medium (T2,ult = 1.50T2(2010) =
1.815) and high (T2,ult = 2.00T2(2010) = 2.420). As before, the model is
calibrated by finding the decline rate r2 for each T2,ult scenario. The
scenarios calibrate well in all three scenarios with r2 = 2.75% (±
0.47%), 1.36% (± 0.22%) and 0.68% (± 0.11%) for low, medium and high
T2,ult scenarios respectively. Fig 2(B) shows the historical and
modelled T2 values, plus H-D's projection to 2050. The profound
deviation from long-term trends reflects the assumptions embedded within
H-D's Stretch scenario, which anticipates major policy changes and a
shift toward very different forms of production.¶ The results of
calibrating Eq (5) to historical data are inconclusive; uncertainty in
T1,ult and T2,ult makes long-term projections unreliable. In any case,
historical observations of decoupling at national levels are fraught,
for the reasons articulated earlier. We conclude that simplistically
extrapolating historical trends is not a reliable technique for
projecting future decoupling behavior. Moreover, the sophisticated
analysis of H-D suggests that deviations from historical trends in Tj
may be plausible, as shown in Figs 2 and 3. Hence from here onward we
will focus on the Stretch scenario from H-D and assume it is a plausible
future of rapid technological development and proactive policy settings,
which could lead to rapid decoupling from energy and material use.¶ In
order to re-calibrate Eq (5) to create a more useful long-term
projection, we use the period 2015--2050 in H-D's Stretch scenario. The
scenario already contains embedded assumptions regarding strong
efficiency gains (30% drop in energy intensity and almost 70% drop in
material intensity by 2050). As with the historical calibration, T1 and
T2 are taken as H-D's predicted energy and material use, I1 and I2
respectively, divided by their predicted GDP. We adopt a single Tj,ult
scenario for each resource, and arbitrarily assume resource use
intensity can be reduced to 50% of the Tj attained by H-D's model in
2050, giving values of T1,ult = 0.881 MJ per thousand \$AUD and T2,ult =
0.139 tonnes per thousand \$AUD. The decline rates rj are calibrated in
the same manner as above.¶ Fig 3 shows the calibrated model runs, with a
projection to 2100. Calibrated decline rates are r1 = 2.06% (± 0.12%)
and r2 = 5.59% (± 0.11%) for final energy demand and material
extraction, respectively. A 95% confidence interval on each Tj
prediction is obtained by performing additional model runs using upper
and lower values for rj (mean ± 1.96 × SE); this is included as a
coloured band around each solid coloured line in Fig 3, but is only
clearly visible on T1, being too narrow to see on T2. Finally, to check
the appropriateness of our Tj,ult scenarios, a further calibration is
performed by varying both rj and Tj,ult. This allows us to estimate the
ultimate resource intensity if technology followed the trend projected
by H-D, giving calibrated values T1,ult = 1.64 (± 0.05) and T2,ult =
0.19 (± 0.01). From this we can see that our projection is more
optimistic than the Stretch scenario of H-D (which was their most
optimistic scenario), and we proceed on the basis that our modelled
conditions must be considered extremely favorable to decoupling.¶ Fig 4
shows values of Tj inferred for current energy and total material use
across a range of countries, in order to provide some context to the
future decoupling scenarios being modelled. It is clear that by this
measure, Australia is already one of the most energy-efficient economies
in the world. H-D project that by 2050 Australia will improve further,
to be on par with Denmark and Sweden today, and our chosen T1,ult value
assumes Australia can ultimately become more energy-efficient (per unit
GDP) than any country on the planet today. With respect to material use,
H-D project that by 2050 Australia will have completely transformed from
being one of the most materially intensive economies today, to being one
of mid-range material intensity (by current measures). Our assumption of
a 50% further reduction in T2,ult would place Australia\'s ultimate
material efficiency at a level equivalent to high-income countries today
that have relatively low dependence on extractive industries, such as
New Zealand. These assumptions can indeed be viewed as an extremely
optimistic scenario of future technological improvement.¶ The calibrated
model can now be used to explore the potential future evolution of
resource use under continued economic growth. For this projection, the
growth rate k = 2.41%, which is the average GDP growth rate from 2015 to
2050 in H-D's Stretch scenario. Fig 5 shows the modelled projection of
impact Ij to 2100. Projected GDP at the end of the century is 7.7 times
its 2015 level. Material extractions and final energy demand in 2100 are
up 29% (95% confidence interval 28.4--30.7%) and 256% (95% confidence
interval 241--273%) respectively, relative to 2015 levels. Considering
the embedded optimistic assumptions for Tj,ult, this result is a robust
rebuttal to the claim of absolute decoupling. Fig 5 also includes the
projections for Ij using the model in which both rj and Tult were
calibrated (i.e. most closely reproducing the trends in H-D's
projections). Using that model, energy demand in 2100 would be five
times higher than in 2015, and material extraction would rise by 71%.¶
Importantly, as Tj moves towards a constant value (Tj,ult), the growth
rate of Ij approaches the economic growth rate k. Thus, whilst in 2015
the growth rates for material extraction and final energy demand (-1.87%
and +1.47% respectively) are all less than the 2.41% economic growth
rate, by 2100 these have changed to +2.16% and +1.89% and by 2150, both
I1 and I2 exhibit growth rates close to the economic growth rate (2.42%
and 2.21% respectively).¶ On the basis of this simple modeling, we
conclude that [[decoupling]{.mark} of GDP growth from resource use,
whether relative or absolute, [is **at best**]{.mark} **only
[temporary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Permanent
decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark} (absolute or relative) [[is
**impossible**]{.mark} for essential, non-substitutable resources
[because]{.mark} the efficiency [gains are]{.mark} ultimately [governed
by physical limits]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Discussion & Conclusions¶ Our
model demonstrates that [growth in GDP ultimately cannot plausibly be
decoupled from growth in material and energy use, demonstrating
categorically that GDP **[growth cannot be sustained]{.mark}
indefinitely**]{.underline}. [It is therefore misleading to develop
growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is
possible]{.underline}. However, we also note that GDP has been shown to
be a poor proxy for societal wellbeing, something it was never designed
to measure, and GDP growth is therefore a questionable long-term
societal goal in any case. The mounting costs of "uneconomic growth"
\[43\] suggest that the pursuit of decoupling--if it were possible--in
order to sustain GDP growth would be a misguided effort.¶ [Society can
sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural
assets, but only by discarding the goal of GDP growth in favor of more
comprehensive measures]{.underline} of societal wellbeing \[44\]. The 17
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recently agreed to by all UN
countries, represent a much broader conception of the goals of society.
These goals include eliminating poverty and hunger, reducing inequality,
protecting and restoring the climate, and terrestrial and marine
ecosystems. Only one of the 17 goals mentions GDP growth, but it is
qualified as "inclusive and sustainable growth". Certainly, GDP growth
over the last several decades has not been inclusive--inequality is
getting worse in most countries. For GDP growth to be sustainable it
would have to be decoupled from energy and material use and
environmental impacts. We have shown that [there is little evidence that
GDP growth can be decoupled in the long-term]{.underline} (i.e. it is
not sustainable).¶ If GDP growth as a societal goal is unsustainable,
then [[it is]{.mark} ultimately [necessary]{.mark} for nations and the
world [to transition to]{.mark} a steady or [declining GDP]{.mark}
scenario]{.underline}. [We contend that [it will be easier to]{.mark}
start this [**transition now** while there is]{.mark} still [capacity
for tech]{.mark}nological [gains, rather than]{.mark} go down the path
of decoupling and [be forced]{.mark} to make a transition [post 2050
when we are closer to]{.mark} the theoretical [limits to
tech]{.mark}nological efficiency [gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. We argue
that [**[now is the time to recognize]{.mark} the [biophysical
limits]{.mark}**, and to begin the overdue task of re-orienting society
around a more achievable and satisfying set of goals than simply growing
forever]{.underline} \[44,45\].

[Warnings about **[eco]{.mark}logical [breakdown]{.mark}** have become
ubiquitous]{.underline}. Over the past few years, major newspapers,
including the Guardian and the New York Times, have carried alarming
stories on [**[soil depletion]{.mark}**, **[defo]{.mark}**restation, and
the [collapse of **fish**]{.mark} **stocks** [and **insect

[**biosphere** and **blowing past**]{.mark} key **[planetary
boundaries]{.mark}** that scientists say must be respected to avoid
**triggering collapse**]{.underline}.

Many [[policymakers]{.mark} have responded by [push]{.mark}ing
for]{.underline} what has come to be called "**[[green
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [All we need to do, they argue, is
invest in more efficient technology and introduce the right
incentives]{.underline}, and we'll be able to keep growing while
simultaneously reducing our impact on the natural world, which is
already at an unsustainable level. In technical terms, the goal is [to
achieve "**absolute decoupling**"]{.underline} of GDP from the total use
of natural resources, according to the U.N. definition.

It sounds like an elegant solution to an otherwise catastrophic problem.
There's just one hitch: [[**New evidence** suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [green growth]{.underline} isn't the panacea everyone has been
hoping for. In fact, [[it **isn't**]{.underline}]{.mark} even
**[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Green growth first became a buzz phrase in 2012 at the United Nations
Cosnference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro. In the run-up
to the conference, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the U.N. Environment Program all
produced reports promoting green growth. Today, it is a core plank of
the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.

But the promise of green growth turns out to have been based more on
wishful thinking than on evidence. In the years since the Rio
conference, three [**[major]{.mark} empirical [studies]{.mark}** have
[arrived at the **same**]{.mark} rather troubling
**[conclusion]{.mark}**: **[Even under]{.mark}** the **[best
conditions]{.mark}**, absolute [decoupling]{.mark} of GDP from resource
use [is not possible]{.mark} on a global scale]{.underline}.

[[A team of scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} led by the German researcher
Monika Dittrich first raised doubts in 2012. The group [[ran a
sophisticated]{.mark} computer [model]{.mark} that predicted what would
happen to global resource use if economic growth continued on its
current trajectory]{.underline}, increasing at about 2 to 3 percent per
year. It found that [[human consumption]{.mark} of natural
resources]{.underline} (including fish, livestock, forests, metals,
minerals, and fossil fuels) [[would rise]{.mark} from 70 billion metric
tons per year in 2012 [to **180** billion]{.mark} metric [tons]{.mark}
per year [by 2050]{.mark}]{.underline}. For reference, [[a sustainable
level]{.underline}]{.mark} of resource use [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
about [[50]{.underline}]{.mark} billion metric tons per year---a
boundary we breached back in 2000.

[The team]{.underline} then [reran the model to see what would happen
[if every nation]{.mark} on Earth **[immediately adopted best
practice]{.mark}** in efficient resource use]{.underline} (an extremely
optimistic assumption). The results improved; [resource [consumption
would hit]{.mark} only **[93]{.mark}** billion metric tons]{.underline}
by 2050. But that is still a lot more than we're consuming today.
Burning through all those resources could hardly be described as
absolute decoupling or green growth.

In 2016, [a second team of scientists tested a different
premise]{.underline}: one in which the world's nations all agreed to go
above and beyond existing best practice. In their best-case scenario,
[the [researchers assumed a tax]{.mark} that would raise the global
price [of carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} from \$50 to \$236 per metric ton
and imagined technological innovations that would double the efficiency
with which we use resources. The results were almost exactly the same as
in Dittrich's study. Under these conditions, if [the global economy kept
growing by 3 percent each year, [we'd]{.mark} still [hit]{.mark} about
**[95]{.mark}**]{.underline} billion metric tons of resource use by
2050. Bottom line: no absolute decoupling.

Finally, [last year [the U.N]{.mark}. Environment
Program]{.underline}---once one of the main cheerleaders of green growth
theory---weighed in on the debate. It [[tested]{.mark} a scenario with
**[carbon priced]{.mark}** at a whopping \$573 per metric ton, slapped
on [a]{.mark} resource **[extraction tax]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} assumed
**[rapid tech]{.mark}**nological **[innovation]{.mark}** spurred by
**strong government support**]{.underline}. [The result? **[We hit
132]{.mark}** billion metric tons by 2050]{.underline}. [[This finding
is worse]{.mark} than those of the two previous studies [because]{.mark}
the researchers accounted for [the "**rebound effect**]{.mark}," whereby
[improvements in]{.mark} **resource [efficiency]{.mark} drive down
prices** and [cause]{.mark} **[demand to rise]{.mark}**---thus
**[canceling]{.mark} out** some of the **[gains]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Study after study shows the same thing]{.underline}. Scientists are
beginning to realize that there are physical limits to how efficiently
we can use resources. Sure, we might be able to produce cars and iPhones
and skyscrapers more efficiently, but we can't produce them out of thin
air. We might shift the economy to services such as education and yoga,
but even universities and workout studios require material inputs. Once
we reach the limits of efficiency, pursuing any degree of economic
growth drives resource use back up.

These problems throw the entire concept of green growth into doubt and
necessitate some radical rethinking. Remember that each of the three
studies used highly optimistic assumptions. We are nowhere near imposing
a global carbon tax today, much less one of nearly \$600 per metric ton,
and resource efficiency is currently getting worse, not better. Yet the
studies suggest that even if we do everything right, decoupling economic
growth with resource use will remain elusive and our environmental
problems will continue to worsen.

Preventing that outcome will require a whole new paradigm. High taxes
and technological innovation will help, but they're not going to be
enough. The only realistic shot humanity has at averting ecological
collapse is to impose hard caps on resource use, as the economist Daniel
O'Neill recently proposed. Such caps, enforced by national governments
or by international treaties, could ensure that we do not extract more
from the land and the seas than the Earth can safely regenerate. We
could also ditch GDP as an indicator of economic success and adopt a
more balanced measure like the genuine progress indicator (GPI), which
accounts for pollution and natural asset depletion. Using GPI would help
us maximize socially good outcomes while minimizing ecologically bad
ones.

But [there's no escaping the obvious conclusion]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [[bringing]{.mark} our [civilization]{.mark} back [within
planetary boundaries]{.mark} is going to [require]{.mark} that [we
**liberate**]{.mark} [**ourselves** from]{.mark} our **dependence on
economic [growth]{.mark}**---[starting with **rich
nations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This might **sound scarier than
it**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[really [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Ending
growth doesn't mean shutting down economic activity---it simply means
that next year we can't produce and consume more than we are doing this
year]{.underline}. It might also mean shrinking certain sectors that are
particularly damaging to our ecology and that are unnecessary for human
flourishing, such as advertising, commuting, and single-use products.

But ending growth doesn't mean that living standards need to take a hit.
Our planet provides more than enough for all of us; the problem is that
its resources are not equally distributed. We can improve people's lives
right now simply by [[sharing]{.mark} what we already have more fairly,
[rather than plundering]{.mark} the Earth for more]{.underline}. Maybe
this means better public services. Maybe it means basic income. Maybe it
means a shorter working week that allows us to scale down production
while still delivering full employment. Policies such as these---and
countless others---[[will be **crucial** to]{.mark} not only
**[surviving the]{.mark} 21st [century]{.mark}** but also flourishing in
it]{.underline}.

[The more you understand the brutal logic of [climate]{.mark}

emergency**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but almost no one is acting like it
is. And it's very, very difficult to be the only one acting like there's
an emergency, especially when the emergency is abstract and
science-derived, grasped primarily by the intellect.

This psychological schism is true for individuals, and it's true for
nations. Take the Paris climate agreement.

In Paris, in 2015, [the countries of the world agreed]{.underline}
(again) [on the moral imperative to hold the rise in global average
temperature to under 2 degrees Celsius]{.underline}, and to pursue
\"efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.\" To date,
62 countries, including the United States, China, and India, have
ratified the agreement.

[Are any]{.underline} [of the countries]{.underline} that signed the
Paris agreement [taking the actions necessary]{.underline} to achieve
that target?

**[No]{.underline}**. The US is not. Nor is the world as a whole.

[The [actions]{.mark} necessary [to hold to 2
degrees]{.mark}]{.underline}, much less 1.5 degrees,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} simply **[[outside the bounds of]{.mark}
conventional [politics in most countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Anyone
who proposed]{.underline} [them would sound crazy]{.underline}, like
they were proposing, I don't know, a war or something.

So we say 2 degrees is unacceptable. But we don't act like it is.

This cognitive dissonance is brought home yet again in a new report from
Oil Change International (in collaboration with a bunch of green
groups). It's about fossil fuels and how much of them we can afford to
dig up and burn, if we're serious about what we said in Paris. It's
mostly simple math, but the implications are vast and unsettling.

Let's start from the beginning.

[[Staying beneath 2]{.mark} degrees [means **immediately and rapidly
declining emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Scientists have long agreed that warming higher than 2 degrees will
result in widespread food, water, weather, and sea level stresses, with
concomitant immigration, conflict, and suffering, inequitably
distributed.

But [2 degrees is not some magic threshold where tolerable becomes
dangerous]{.underline}. A two-year review of the latest science by the
UNFCCC found that the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees means heat
extremes, water shortages, and falling crop yields. \"[The 'guardrail'
concept, in which up to 2°C of warming is considered
safe]{.underline},\" the review concluded, \"[is
inadequate.\"]{.underline}

[The report recommends that [2 degrees]{.mark} be seen instead as \"an
upper limit]{.underline}, [a defense line that [needs to be
**stringently defended**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while less warming would
be preferable.\"

[This changing understanding of 2 degrees matters]{.underline}, [because
the temperature target we choose]{.underline}, and the probability with
which we aim to hit it, [establishes our \"**carbon
budget**]{.underline},\" i.e., the amount of CO2 we can still emit
before blowing it.

Many commonly used scenarios (including the International Energy
Agency's) are built around a 50 percent chance of hitting 2 degrees. But
[if 2 degrees is an \"upper limit]{.underline}\" and \"less warming
would be preferable,\" it seems [we would want a higher than 50-50
chance of stopping short of]{.underline} it.

So the authors of the Oil Change report choose two scenarios to model.
One gives us a 66 percent chance of stopping short of 2 degrees. The
other gives us a 50 percent chance of stopping short of 1.5 degrees.
Here's what they look like:

This image should terrify you. It should be on billboards.

As you can see, in either scenario, [global [emissions must peak and
**begin declining immediately**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For a medium
chance to avoid 1.5 degrees, [[the world has to zero out]{.mark} net
carbon [emissions by]{.mark} [2050]{.mark} or so]{.underline} --- for a
good chance of avoiding 2 degrees, by around 2065.

[After that, **[emissions have to go negative]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Humanity has to start burying a lot more carbon]{.underline} than it
throws up into the atmosphere. There are several ways to sequester
greenhouse gases, from reforestation to soil enrichment to cow
backpacks, but the backbone of the envisioned negative emissions is
BECCS, or bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration.

[BECCS]{.underline} --- raising, harvesting, and burning biomass for
energy, while capturing and burying the carbon emissions --- [is
unproven at scale]{.underline}. Thus far, most demonstration plants of
any size attaching CCS to fossil fuel facilities have been over-budget
disasters. What if we can't rely on it? What if it never pans out?

\"[If we want to avoid depending on unproven technology becoming
available]{.underline},\" the authors say, \"[emissions would need to be
reduced **even more rapidly**]{.underline}.\"

You could say that. This is from climate researcher Glen Peters, based
on a scenario with a 66 percent chance of avoiding 1.5 degrees.

Check out that middle graphic. [[If we really want to avoid 1.5]{.mark}
degrees]{.underline}, and we can't rely on large-scale carbon
sequestration, then [[the]{.mark} global [community has to zero
out]{.mark} its carbon [emissions by]{.mark} 2026]{.underline}.

**[[Ten years from now]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[There's no happy]{.mark} win-win [story]{.mark} about that
scenario]{.underline}, [[no way to pull it off while continuing]{.mark}
to live [US lifestyles and **growing the global economy**]{.mark}
**every year**]{.underline}. [[It would]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[require]{.mark} [immediate]{.mark}, radical shifts in
behavior]{.underline} worldwide, especially among the wealthy --- [a
period of **voluntary [austerity and contraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That seems unlikely. So instead, let's assume copious negative emissions
technology will be available in the latter half of the century, just to
give ourselves the most room possible.

In those scenarios, how much of the world's fossil fuels can we burn?
How much more can we find and dig up?

That math is daunting.

[[Staying beneath 2]{.mark} degrees [means **ceasing all new fossil fuel
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, a quick tour of terminology. There are fossil fuel resources
(what is ultimately recoverable), reserves (what is known and
economically recoverable), and developed reserves (what is known and
recoverable in currently operating mines and fields). Here's a handy
guide:

Now let's compare some numbers. It's pretty straightforward. Roughly 95
percent of the carbon contained in fossil fuels gets released into the
atmosphere, so a ton dug up means a ton emitted, more or less.

How do our carbon budgets compare with our fossil fuel reserves?

Another terrifying image.

On the left is global developed fossil fuel reserves. Remember the
terminology: That's what we can likely get out of currently operating
fields and mines. On the right are our carbon budgets, for the 2 degree
and 1.5 degree scenarios respectively. Existing developed reserves
exceed the 2 degree budget, and oil and gas alone break the 1.5 degree
budget.

[[If we are serious]{.mark} about what we said in Paris, [then]{.mark}
[no more exploring]{.mark} for new fossil fuels. No new mines, wells, or
fossil fuel infrastructure. And **[rapid, managed decline]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} existing [fossil fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We are betting our species' future on our ability to bury carbon

An important note: The analysts at Oil Change assume that there will be
BECCS from midcentury onward, but assume that CCS will not come online
fast enough to substantially delay the decline of fossil fuels before
then.

Obviously, that assumption could be wrong on either end. CCS could
develop faster than expected or turn out to be utterly impractical and
too costly on any time scale. It's too soon to know.

What is clear is that [[we are betting]{.mark} our collective future [on
being able to bury]{.mark} millions of tons of
[carbon]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It's a huge and **existentially risky
bet**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and maybe one out of a million people
even know it's being made.

Humanity is in a desperate situation

There are modeling scenarios that show us hitting our climate targets.
But we should take no comfort from them. The fact is, [we have waited
until perilously late to act on climate change, and our range of options
has narrowed.]{.underline} We face three choices:

1\) In the event that massive carbon sequestration proves infeasible,
[[avoiding dangerous climate change]{.mark} will require an immediate
and precipitous decline in global carbon emissions over a decade or
two.]{.underline} [Given that most present-day economic activity is
driven by fossil fuels, it [would mean]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least
temporarily, [[a **net**]{.mark} **[decline in economic
activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. No one wants to discuss this, except
climate scientist Kevin Anderson:

Professor Pete Smith: So I think the 1.5 degrees target is something we
should aim at. Whether we get there or not is partly academic, and it's
the fact that we're aiming for 1.5 degrees which is the important thing.
If we're breaking our back to get to 1.5 and we end up at 1.8 or 2,
that's better than aiming at 2 and ending up at 4 degrees Celsius.

Professor Kevin Anderson: [From a carbon budget point of view, I think
it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to hold to 1.5
degrees]{.underline} Centigrade. [I am very skeptical of]{.underline}
the negative emissions technologies, particularly [BECCS]{.underline} --
the biomass energy carbon capture and storage. I do think we should
research them; I think it's very important that we progress our
understanding of these technologies, but I actually think we should
assume they do not work when we develop emission scenarios. So I think
it's very unlikely we'll hold to 1.5 degrees Centigrade, and to be
honest [I think it's very unlikely we'll hold to a reasonable
probability of 2 degrees Centigrade now]{.underline}. My concern with an
event like this is [[we]{.mark} are prepared to [rely on **utopian
technologies**]{.mark} [that do not]{.mark} yet
[exist]{.mark}]{.underline}, but we're not prepared to look at [[actual
mitigation]{.mark} today]{.underline}, which sort of [[has]{.mark}
[profound]{.mark} challenging [questions for the **current economic
paradigm**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [Until we are prepared to actually
open up that Pandora's box]{.underline}, in which we'll actually ask
questions about how we live our lives today, I think [we are unlikely to
hold to even 2 degrees Centigrade]{.underline}.

#### Short-term collapse of the global economy is the only way to avoid catastrophic warming\-\--[delay locks in]{.underline} catastrophic emissions 

David **Holmgren 13**, founder of Holmgren Design Services, an
environmental design and consulting firm, inventor of the Permaculture
system for regenerative agriculture, 2013, "Crash on Demand: Welcome to
the Brown Tech Future," Simplicity Institute report,
<http://simplicityinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CrashOnDemandSimplicityInstitute.pdf>

Many [climate policy professionals]{.underline} and climate activists
[are]{.underline} now [reassessing whether there is]{.underline}
[anything]{.underline} more [they can do to]{.underline} help
[prevent]{.underline} the [global catastrophe]{.underline} that climate
change appears to be. The passing of the symbolic 400ppm CO2 level
certainly has seen some prominent activists getting close to a change of
strategy. As the Transition Town movement founder and permaculture
activist Rob Hopkins says, the shift in the mainstream policy circles
from mitigation to adaptation and defence is underway (i.e. giving
up).13

While political deadlock remains the most obvious obstacle, I believe at
least some of that [deadlock stems from]{.underline} widespread [doubt
about whether]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions can be]{.underline}
radically [reduced without economic contraction]{.underline} and/or
substantial wealth redistribution. Substantial redistribution of wealth
is not generally taken seriously perhaps because it could only come
about through some sort of global revolution that would itself lead to
global economic collapse. On the other hand, massive economic
contraction seems like it might happen all by itself, without
necessarily leading to greater equity.

[The]{.underline} predominant [focus]{.underline} in the \"climate
professional and activist community\" [on policies]{.underline}, plans
and projects [for transition to renewable energy and efficiency has yet
to show evidence of absolute reductions in]{.underline} greenhouse gas
[emissions that do not depend on rising]{.underline} greenhouse gas
[emissions in other parts of the global economy]{.underline}. For
example, the contribution of renewable technology installation to
reduced GGE in some European countries appears to be balanced by
increased GGE in China and India (where much of the renewable
technologies are manufactured).

The [Jevons\' paradox]{.underline}14 [suggests]{.underline} than [any
[gains in efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[or]{.underline}
tapping of [new sources of energy [will]{.mark}]{.underline} simply
[[expand total consumption]{.mark} rather than reduce consumption of
resources]{.underline} (and therefore GGE).

Richard Eckersley in his article \'Deficit Deeper Than Economy\'
identifies the improbability of ever decoupling economic growth from
resource depletion and green house gas emissions. He states
\"Australia\'s material footprint, the total amount of primary resources
required to service domestic consumption (excludes exports and includes
imports) was 35 tonnes per person in 2008, the highest among the 186
countries studied. Every 10 per cent increase in gross domestic product
increases the average national material footprint by 6 per cent. By
2050, a global population of 9 billion people would require an estimated
270 billion tonnes of natural resources to fuel the level of consumption
of OECD countries, compared with the 70 billion tonnes consumed in
2010.\"15

[[Time seems to be running out]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[any serious planned [reductions in]{.mark}]{.underline} GGE\[Greenhouse
Gas [[Emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [adequate to prevent dangerous
climate change]{.underline} [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} considering
[[a powerdown of the]{.mark} growth [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
ideas of degrowth16 are starting to get an airing, mostly in Europe, but
the chances of these ideas being adopted and successfully implemented
would require a long slow political evolution if not revolution. We
don\'t have time for the first, and the second almost certainly crashes
the financial system, which in turn crashes the global economy.

IS TIME RUNNING OUT FOR BOTTOM UP ALTERNATIVES?

Like many others, I have argued that the bottom up creation of household
and community economies, already proliferating in the shadow of the
global economy, can create and sustain different ways of well-being that
can compensate, at least partly, for the inevitable contraction in
centralised fossil fuelled economies (now well and truly failing to
sustain the social contract in countries such as Greece and Egypt). When
the official Soviet Union economy collapsed in the early \'90s it was
the informal economy that cushioned the social impact. Permaculture
strategies focus on the provision of basic needs at the household and
community level to increase resilience, reduce ecological footprint and
allow much of the discretionary economy to shrink. In principle,
[a]{.underline} [[major contraction in energy consumption is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark} [because a large proportion of that
consumption is for non-essential uses]{.underline} by more than a
billion middle class people. That [[contraction has the potential
to]{.underline} [switch off]{.underline}]{.mark} [greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} but this has not been seriously
discussed or debated by those currently working very hard to get global
action for rapid transition by planned and co-ordinated processes. Of
course it is more complicated because the provision of fundamental
needs, such as water, food etc., are part of the same highly integrated
system that meets discretionary wants.

However, the time available to create, refine and rapidly spread
successful models of these bottom-up solutions is running out, in the
same way that the time for government policy and corporate capitalism to
work their magic in converting the energy base of growth from fossil to
renewable sources.17 [If the climate clock is really so close to
midnight what else could be done?]{.underline}

Economic crash as hell or salvation

For many decades I have felt that [a]{.underline} [[collapse of
the]{.mark} global [economic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[might]{.underline} [save humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} [and many of
our fellow species]{.underline} great suffering [[by happening sooner
rather than later]{.underline}]{.mark} [because the stakes keep rising
and [scale of the impacts are]{.mark} always [worse by being
postponed]{.mark}]{.underline}. An important influence in my thinking on
the chances of such a collapse was the public speech given by President
Ronald Reagan following the 1987 stock market crash. He said \"there
won\'t be an economic collapse, so long as people don\'t believe there
will be an economic collapse\" or words to that effect. I remember at
the time thinking; fancy the most powerful person on the planet
admitting that faith (of the populous) is the only thing that holds the
financial system together.

Two decades on I remember thinking that [[a second]{.mark} great
[depression might be the best outcome]{.mark} we could hope
for]{.underline}. The [pain]{.underline} and suffering that has happened
[since 2007]{.underline} [(from the more limited \"great recession\")
is]{.underline} more [a result of the ability of]{.underline} the
existing [power structures to maintain control]{.underline} and enforce
harsh circumstances by handing the empty bag to the public, [than any
fundamental lack of resources]{.underline} to provide all with basic
needs. Is the commitment to perpetual growth in wealth for the richest
the only way that everyone else can hope to get their needs met? The
economy is simply not structured to provide all with their basic needs.
[That [growth]{.mark} economy [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[certainly
coming to an end]{.underline}; [but will it]{.underline}
[slowly]{.underline}]{.mark} [grind to a [halt or collapse]{.mark} more
[rapidly?]{.mark}]{.underline}

The fact that the market price for carbon emissions has fallen so low in
Europe is a direct result of stagnating growth. [Past]{.underline}
economic [recessions and more serious economic collapses,]{.underline}
such as faced by the Soviet Union after its oil production peaked in the
late 1980\'s,18 [show how]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions can and
have been reduced, then stabilizing at lower levels once the economy
stabilized without any planned intention]{.underline} to do so. The
large number of oil exporters that have more recently peaked has
provided many case studies to show the correlation with political
upheaval, economic contraction and reductions in GGE. Similarly many of
the countries that have suffered the greatest economic contraction are
also those with the greatest dependence on imported energy, such as
Ireland, Greece and Portugal. The so-called Arab Spring, especially in
Egypt, followed high food and energy prices driven by collapsed oil
revenues and inability to maintain subsidies. The radical changes of
government in Egypt have not been able to arrest the further contraction
of the economy.

The effects of peak oil and climate change have combined with
geopolitical struggles over pipeline routes to all but destroy the
Syrian economy and society.19

Slow Contraction or Fast Collapse

[The [fragility]{.mark} of the global economy]{.underline} has many
unprecedented aspects that [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} some sort of
[[rapid collapse]{.mark} of the global economy [more
likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [capacity]{.mark} of central banks [to
repeat]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[massive stimulus]{.underline}]{.mark}
mechanism [[in response to]{.mark} the 20[08]{.mark} global financial
crisis]{.underline}, [[has been]{.mark} greatly
[reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while the [faith that underpins
the]{.mark} global financial [system has weakened]{.mark}]{.underline},
to say the least. Systems thinkers such as David Korowicz20 have argued
that the [inter-connected nature of the global economy]{.underline},
instantaneous communications and financial flows, \"just in time\"
logistics, and extreme degrees of economic and technological
specialisation, [have increased the chances of a large scale systemic
failure]{.underline}, at the same time that they have mitigated (or at
least reduced) the impact of more limited localised crises.

Whether novel factors such as information technology, global peak oil
and climate change have increased the likelihood of more extreme
economic collapse, Foss and Keen have convinced me that
[the]{.underline} [most powerful and fast-acting factor]{.underline}
[that could radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions is]{.underline}
[the scale of financial debt and the long-sustained growth of bubble
economics]{.underline} stretching back at least to the beginnings of the
\"Thatcherite/Reaganite revolution\" in the early 1980s. From an
energetics perspective, the peak of US oil production in 1970, and the
resulting global oil crises of 73 and 79, laid the foundations for the
gigantic growth in debt that super accelerated the level of consumption,
and therefore GGE.

Whatever the causes, all economic bubbles follow a trajectory that
includes a rapid contraction, as credit evaporates, followed by a
long-sustained contraction, where asset values decline to lower levels
than those at the beginning of the bubble. After almost 25 years of
asset price deflation in Japan, a house and land parcel of 1.5ha in a
not too isolated rural location can be bought for \$25,000. A
contraction in the systems that supply wants are likely to see
simultaneous problems in the provision of basic needs. As Foss explains,
in a deflationary contraction, prices of luxuries generally collapse but
essentials of food and fuel do not fall much. Most importantly,
essentials become unaffordable for many, once credit freezes and job
security declines. It goes without saying that deflation rather
inflation is the economic devil that governments and central banks most
fear and are prepared to do almost anything to avoid.

Giving credence to the evidence for fast global economic collapse may
suggest I am moving away from my belief in the more gradual Energy
Descent future that I helped articulate. John Michael Greer has been
very critical of apocalyptic views of the future in which a collapse
sweeps away the current world leaving the chosen few who survive to
build the new world. In large measure I agree with his critique but
recognise that some might interpret my work as suggesting a permaculture
paradise growing from the ashes of this civilisation. To some extent
this is a reasonable interpretation, but I see that collapse, as a long
drawn-out process rather than resulting from a single event.21

I still believe that energy descent will go on for many decades or even
centuries. In Future Scenarios I suggested [energy descent driven by
climate change and peak oil could occur through a series of crises
separating relatively stable states that could persist for
decades]{.underline} if not centuries. [The collapse of the global
financial system might]{.underline} simply [be the first of those crises
that reorganise the world]{.underline}. The pathways that energy descent
could take are enormously varied, but still little discussed, so it is
not surprising that discussions about descent scenarios tend to default
into ones of total collapse. As the language around energy descent and
collapse has become more nuanced, [we start to see the distinction
between financial, economic, social and civilisational collapse as
potential stages in an energy descent process]{.underline} where the
first is fast changing and relatively superficial and the last is slow
moving and more fundamental.

In Future Scenarios I suggested the more extreme scenarios of Earth
Steward and Lifeboat could follow Green Tech and Brown Tech along the
stepwise energy descent pathway. [If we are heading into the Brown Tech
world of more severe climate change]{.underline}, [then as the energy
sources that sustain the Brown Tech scenario deplete]{.underline}, [and
climate chaos increases,]{.underline} future crises and collapse could
lead to the Lifeboat Scenario. [In this scenario]{.underline}, [no
matter how fast or extreme the reductions in GGE]{.underline} [due to
economic collapse]{.underline}, [we still end up in the climate
cooker]{.underline}, but with only the capacity for very local,
household and communitarian organisation.

If the climate crisis is already happening, and as suggested in Future
Scenarios, the primary responses to the crisis increase rather than
reduce GGE, then [it is]{.underline} probably [too late for any
concerted effort to shift course to the more benign Green Tech energy
descent future]{.underline}. Given that most of the world is yet to
accept the inevitability of Energy Descent and are still pinning their
faith in \"Techno Stability\" if not \"Techno Explosion\", the globally
cooperative powerdown processes needed to shift the world to Green Tech
look unlikely. More fundamental than any political action, the resurgent
rural and regional economies, based on a boom for agricultural and
forestry commodities, that structurally underpins the Green Tech
scenario, will not eventuate if climate change is fast and severe.
Climate change will stimulate large investments in agriculture but they
are more likely to be energy and resource intensive, controlled climate
agriculture (greenhouses), centralised at transport hubs. This type of
development simply reinforces the Brown Tech model including the
acceleration of GGE.

[While it may be too late for the Green Tech Scenario,]{.underline} [[it
still may be possible to avoid]{.mark} more [extreme climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} of a long drawn out Brown Tech Scenario
[[before]{.mark} natural [forcing]{.mark} factors]{.underline} [[lock
humanity into]{.mark} the climate cooker of [4-6
degrees]{.mark}]{.underline} and resource depletion leads to a collapse
of the centralised Brown Tech governance and a rise of local war lords
(Lifeboat Scenario).

The novel structural vulnerabilities highlighted by David Korowicz, and
the unprecedented extremity of the bubble economics highlighted by
Nicole Foss suggest the strong tendencies towards a Brown Tech world
could be short lived. Instead, [[severe global economic]{.mark} and
societal [collapse could switch off GGE enough to begin reversing
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}; in essence [the Earth Steward
scenario of recreated bioregional economies based on frugal agrarian
resources and abundant salvage from the collapsed global
economy]{.underline} and defunct national governance structures.

#### Collapse solves warming\-\--it makes it [impossible]{.underline} to [finance]{.underline} the resource extraction projects that lock in warming

David **Holmgren 13**, founder of Holmgren Design Services, an
environmental design and consulting firm, inventor of the Permaculture
system for regenerative agriculture, 2013, "Crash on Demand: Welcome to
the Brown Tech Future," Simplicity Institute report,
<http://simplicityinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CrashOnDemandSimplicityInstitute.pdf>

The evidence that [the global financial system is a]{.underline}
[not-so-slow moving train crash]{.underline} is getting stronger. That
investors and the billion or so middle class people who have any savings
and discretionary expenditure are losing faith, might be an
understatement. It may be that paralysis and [inertia is all that is
holding the system together]{.underline}.¶ [A [collapse]{.mark} in
credit [could make it]{.mark}]{.underline} [very [difficult to
raise]{.mark} the [finance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[necessary for
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [ongoing [extraction of tar sands,
shale]{.mark} gas]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} [other]{.mark} mad resource
[extraction projects]{.mark} that are]{.underline}
[[accelerating]{.mark} the production of]{.underline} GGE\[Greenhouse
Gas [[Emissions]{.mark}\]]{.underline}. [[A deflationary spiral]{.mark}
that follows from a credit crisis and collapsing asset]{.underline}
(housing, etc.) [values [could]{.mark}]{.underline} [[change
behaviour]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the extent that people stop spending
on anything but essentials]{.underline} because of job insecurity and
the fact that everything will be cheaper next month.¶ I believe the
chances of global economic collapse (in the next five years) being
severe enough to achieve this have to be rated at least 50%. Further I
believe many climate activists and policy professionals are shifting to
at least privately hoping this might be the case because the chances of
a planned powerdown seems to be fading.¶ If we accept [[a]{.mark} global
[financial crash]{.mark} could [make it]{.mark}]{.underline} [very
difficult, if not]{.underline} [[impossible]{.mark}, [to restart
the]{.mark} global [economy with anything other
than]{.mark}]{.underline} [[drastically reduced
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [an argument can be mounted for
putting effort into]{.underline} [precipitating that crash, the crash of
the financial system]{.underline}. Any such plan would of course invite
being blamed for causing it when it happens. No one wants to be strung
up along with the bankers for causing a global version of Greece, Egypt
or many other countries, let alone the horrors of Syria. On the other
hand, we have no precedent to indicate how bad conditions might be in
currently affluent countries.¶ The picture I am building is that it is
almost inevitable that those who warn of the crisis will get the blame
for causing it. So if we are going to be blamed anyway, [[we
could]{.mark} be proactive about it and]{.underline} at least [[get the
advantage for humanity of crisis now, rather than
later]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the people of Syria caught in the grip
of climate, energy and geopolitical struggle, all this hardly matters
because it couldn\'t get worse for them. In fact conditions in such
stricken places could actually improve if global superpower competition
is disabled by the collapse of the global finance. Even the average
citizen in Greece or Egypt might be hoping to see the remaining affluent
countries get a \'taste of their own medicine\'. The complexity of
global human overshoot, so long predicted, and now unfolding, is far too
multifaceted to be captured by any simple story about good, innocence,
evil and blame.¶ Before considering whether this is a good idea or not,
I want to consider whether concerted action by limited numbers of
activists could bring it about?¶ Given the current fragilities of global
finance, I believe a radical change in the behaviour of a relatively
small proportion of the global middle class could precipitate such a
crash. For example a 50% reduction of consumption and 50% conversion of
assets into building household and local community resilience by say 10%
of the population in affluent countries would show up as 5% reduction in
demand in a system built on perpetual growth and a 5% reduction in
savings capital available for banks to lend. Small fluctuations in the
supply-demand balance can have a massive effect on prices. Further,
[when the system has been growing due to rising debt]{.underline},
arguably for decades, [then the vulnerability to drops in demand can be
massive]{.underline}. For example, small drops in demand for new houses
and the high fuel costs of commuting for those servicing mortgages,
triggered the collapse of the housing bubble in the USA and other
countries.¶ It seems obvious to me that it is easier to convince a
minority that they will be better off by disengaging from the system
than any efforts to build mass movements demanding impossible outcomes
or convincing elites to turn off the system that is currently keeping
them in power.¶ I accept that many people find the idea of assisting
economic collapse abhorrent, even if that collapse is becoming more and
more likely as a collective outcome of human actions. Daryl Taylor uses
the caring metaphor \"hospicing and euthanasing\" the old/dying system
along with \"doula-ing and midwifing the new/emerging system. Whatever
the metaphors, climate activists who believe [we are on the verge
of]{.underline} [runaway catastrophic [climate change]{.mark} that [will
be]{.mark} far [worse than]{.mark} simply [stalling]{.mark} [the
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} do have options other than
shouting louder for mitigation or shifting to adaptation and defence.
Rather than simply planning for bad and rocky energy descent delivered
initially by economic depression, they could choose to focus their
energy on actively trying to destroy faith in the financial system.

### Warming Impact

#### Warming causes [extinction]{.underline} -- a [confluence]{.underline} of [nonlinear]{.underline} and [unpredictable]{.underline} effects -- action now is key

https://www.lawfareblog.com/climate-change-and-national-security-part-ii-how-big-threat-climate\]

At least until 2050, and possibly for decades after, [[climate change
will]{.mark} remain a **creeping threat** that will **exacerbate and
[amplify]{.mark}** existing, **structural** global
**inequalities**]{.underline}. While the developed world will be
negatively affected by climate change through 2050, the consequences of
climate change will be felt most acutely in the developing world. The
national security threats posed by climate change to 2050 are likely to
differ in degree, not kind, from the kinds of threats already posed by
climate change. For the next few decades, [climate change will
**exacerbate [humanitarian crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[some of
[which]{.mark} will [result in]{.mark} the [deployment of **military
personnel**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as material and financial
assistance. [[It will]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[aggravate]{.underline}]{.mark}** natural **[resource
constraints]{.underline}**, potentially [contributing to]{.underline}
political and economic [[**conflict** over **water**, **food** and
**energy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The question for the next 30 years is not "can humanity survive as a
species with 1.5°C or 2°C of warming," but, "how much will the existing
disparities between the developed and developing world widen, and how
long (and how successfully) can these widening political/economic
disparities be sustained?" The urgency of the climate threat in the next
few decades will depend, to a large degree, on whether and how much the
U.S. government perceives a widening of these global inequities as a
threat to U.S. national security.

By contrast, [if emissions continue to **creep upward**]{.underline} (or
if they do not decline rapidly), by 2100 climate-related national
security [threats could be **existential**]{.underline}. [[The
question]{.mark} for the next hundred years [is]{.mark}
not]{.underline}, "are disparities politically and economically
manageable?" but, "[[can the **global order**]{.mark}, premised on the
**nation-state system**, itself based on territorial sovereignty,
**[survive]{.mark}** in a world in which **substantial swathes of
territory** are potentially **uninhabitable**]{.underline}?"

National Security Consequences of Climate Change to 2050

Scientists can predict the consequences of climate change to 2050 with
some measure of certainty. (Beyond that date, the pace and magnitude of
climate change---and therefore, the national security threat posed by
it---depend heavily on the level of emissions in the coming years, as I
have explained.) There is relative agreement across modeled climate
scenarios that the world will likely warm, on average, at least 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels by about 2050---but perhaps as soon as 2030.
This level of warming is likely to occur even if the world succeeds in
dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as even the recent
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report implicitly
admits. In other words, a certain amount of additional warming---at
least 1.5°C, and probably more than that---is presumptively unavoidable.

Looking ahead to 2050, it can be said with relative confidence that the
national security consequences of climate change will vary in degree,
not in kind, from the national security threats already facing the
United States. This is hardly good news. [[Even **small differences**
in]{.mark} global average [**temperatures** result in
**significant**]{.mark} **environmental [changes]{.mark}**,
[with]{.mark} attendant **[social]{.mark}**, [**economic** and
**political consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By 2050, [[climate
change will **wreak**]{.mark} **increasing [havoc]{.mark}** [on
**human** and **natural systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}---predominantly,
but not exclusively, in the developing
world---[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} attenuated but [**profound
[consequences]{.mark}** [for **national security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In particular, [[changes in **temperature**]{.mark}, the **[hydrological
cycle]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the [**ranges of insects** will impact
**food availability**]{.mark} and food access in much of the world,
increasing food insecurity]{.underline}. [**[Storms]{.mark}**,
**[flooding]{.mark}**, **[changes in ocean pH]{.mark}** and other
climate-linked changes [will damage **infrastructure**]{.mark} and
negatively impact [**labor productivity** and]{.mark} economic
**[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} in much of the world. [Vector-borne
[**diseases** will]{.mark} also [be]{.mark}come **more
[prevalent]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as climate change will expand the
geographic **range** and **intensity** of **transmission** of diseases
like malaria, West Nile, Zika and dengue fever, and
cholera]{.underline}. [Rising **public health [challenges]{.mark}**,
**economic devastation** and **food insecurity** [will translate
into]{.mark} an increased **demand** for **humanitarian assistance**
provided by the **military**, increased
**[migration]{.mark}**]{.underline}---especially from tropical and
subtropical regions---[[and **geopolitical
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Long-term trends such as declining food security, coupled with
short-term events like hurricanes, could sustain unprecedented levels of
migration. The 2015 refugee crisis in Europe portends the kinds of
population movements that will only accelerate in the coming decades:
people from Africa, Southwest and South Asia and elsewhere crossing land
and water to reach Europe. For the United States, this likely means
greater numbers of people seeking entry from both Central America and
the Caribbean. Such influxes are not unprecedented, but they are
unlikely to abate and could increase in volume over the next few
decades, driven in part by climate change-related food insecurity,
climate change-related storms and also by economic and political
instability. Food insecurity, economic losses and loss of human life are
also likely to exacerbate existing political tensions in the developing
world, especially in regions with poor governance and/or where the
climate is particularly vulnerable to warming (e.g., the Mediterranean
basin). While the Arab Spring had many underlying causes, it also
coincided with a period of high food prices, which arguably contributed
to the protests. In some situations, [**food insecurity**, **economic
losses** and **public health crises**, combined with **weak** and
ineffectual **governance**, could **precipitate future
conflicts**]{.underline} of this kind---although it will be difficult to
know where and when without more precise local studies of both
underlying political dynamics and the regionally-specific impacts of
climate change.

2100 and Beyond

While the national security impacts of climate change to 2050 are likely
to be costly and disruptive for the U.S. military---and devastating for
many people around the world---at some point after 2050, if warming
continues at its current pace, [changes to the climate could
**fundamentally reshape geopolitics**]{.underline} and possibly even the
current nation-state basis of the current global order.

To be clear, both the ultimate level of warming and its attendant
political consequences is highly speculative, for the reasons I
explained in my last post. Nonetheless, we do know that the planet is
currently on track for at least 3-4°C of warming by 2100. The "known
knowns" of higher levels of warming---say, 3°C---are frightening. At
that 3°C of warming, for example, scientists project that [there
will]{.underline} be a nearly [[**70 percent decline** in
**wheat**]{.mark} production [in **Central America** and]{.mark} the
Caribbean]{.underline}, [[**75 percent** of]{.mark} the [**land area**
in]{.mark} the **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
more than [50 percent in South Asia will be affected by highly unusual
heat, and [**sea level rise** could **displace**]{.mark} and imperil the
lives **[hundreds of millions]{.mark}** of people]{.underline}, among
other consequences.

But [even higher levels of warming are physically possible within this
century]{.underline}. At these levels of warming, [some
**[regions]{.mark} of the world** [would be **literally
uninhabitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, likely resulting in the
depopulation of the tropics, [[to say nothing of]{.mark} the
consequences of [**sea-level rise** for]{.mark} **[economically
important cities]{.mark}** such as Amsterdam and New York]{.underline}.
[Even if newly warmed regions of the far north could **theoretically
accommodate** the resulting **migrants**, this **presumes** that the
**political response** to this unprecedented **global displacement**
would be **orderly** and **conflict-free** **borders on
fantasy**]{.underline}.

The geopolitical consequences of significant levels of warming are
severe, but if these changes occur in a linear way, at least there will
be time for human systems to adjust. Perhaps [more challenging for
national security is the possibility that the until-now [**linear
changes give way** to **abrupt**]{.mark} and **[irreversible
ones]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Scientists forecast that, [at higher levels
of warming]{.underline}---precisely what level is
speculative---[[humanity could trigger **catastrophic**]{.mark},
[**abrupt** and **unavoidable consequences**]{.mark} to the
**ecosystem**]{.underline}. [The IPCC has considered **nine** such
abrupt changes]{.underline}; [[one example]{.mark} is the]{.underline}
potential [**[shutting down]{.mark}** of the **[Indian]{.mark} summer
[monsoon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Over a **billion**]{.mark} people
[are **dependent**]{.mark} upon the Indian monsoon]{.underline}, [which
provides parts of South Asia with about 80 percent of its annual
rainfall]{.underline}; relatively minor changes in the monsoon in either
direction can cause disasters. In 2010, a wetter monsoon led to the
catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, which directly affected 20 million
people; a drier monsoon in 2002 led to devastating drought. Studies
suggest that the Indian summer monsoon has two stable states: wet (i.e.,
the current state) and dry (characterized by low precipitation over the
subcontinent). At some point, if warming continues, the monsoon could
abruptly shift into the second, "dry" state, with catastrophic
consequences for over a billion people dependent on monsoon-fed
agriculture. The IPCC suggests that such a state-shift is
"unlikely"---that is, there is a 10 to 33 percent chance that a
state-shift will happen in the 21st century---but scientists also have
relatively low confidence in their understanding of the underlying
mechanisms in this and other large-scale natural systems.

The consequences of abrupt, severe warming for national security are
obvious in general, if unclear in the specifics. In 2003, [the Defense
Department]{.underline} asked a [contractor]{.underline} to explore such
a scenario. The resulting report outlined the offensive and defensive
national security strategies countries may adopt if faced with abrupt
climate change, and [highlighted the **increased risk** of inter- and
intra-state **conflict** over natural **resources** and
**immigration**]{.underline}. Although the report may be off in its
imagined timeframe (positing abrupt climate change by 2020), the world
it conjures is improbable but not outlandish. If the Indian monsoon were
to switch to dry state, and a billion people were suddenly without
reliable food sources, for example, it is not clear how the Indian
government would react, assuming it would survive in its current form.
Major wars or low-intensity proxy conflicts seem likely, if not
inevitable, in such a scenario.

This is not to say that a parade of climate horribles is certain---or
even likely---to come to pass. Scientific understanding of the
sensitivities in the climate system are far from perfect. It is also
possible that emissions will decline more rapidly than anticipated,
averting the worst consequences of climate change. But this outcome is
far from guaranteed. And even if global emissions decline precipitously,
humanity cannot be sure when or whether the planet has crossed a climate
tipping point beyond which the incremental nature of the current changes
shifts from the current linear, gradual progression to a non-linear and
abrupt process.

Within the next few decades, the most likely scenario involves
manageable, but costly, consequences on infrastructure, food security
and natural disasters, which will be borne primarily by the world's most
impoverished citizens and the members of the military who provide them
with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. But
[**[while]{.mark}** the [head-turning]{.mark} national security
**[impacts]{.mark}** of climate change [are **probably**]{.mark} several
**[decades away]{.mark}**, [the **nature of the threat** is such
that]{.mark} [**waiting until** these **changes manifest** is
**not**]{.mark} **a [viable]{.mark} option**]{.underline}. [[By the
time]{.mark} the climate [consequences are severe enough]{.mark} to
compel action, [there is]{.mark} likely to be [little that can be
done]{.mark} on human timescales [to undo]{.mark} the [changes to
**environmental systems**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the **[human societies
dependent upon them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Turns War\-\--2NC

#### Growth makes war inevitable

Manuchehr **Irandoust 17**, Department of Economics and Finance, School
of Business Studies, Kristianstad University, "Militarism and
globalization: Is there an empirical link?" *Quality and quantity*, June
16, 2017, Springer Open Access

\[GLOB = globalization index, MIS = militarized spending\]

The results of the bootstrap panel Granger causality test are shown in
Table 2. The findings show that [**GLOB and MIS are causally related**
in most of the countries under review]{.underline}. There is a
bi-directional causality in UK, US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. The
causality is unidirectional running from GLOB to MIS in Australia,
Brazil, India, and China, and running from MIS to GLOB in Turkey. The
degree of significance level varies from country to country. There is no
any causal relationship between military spending and globalization in
France, Italy, South Korea, Germany, and Japan. Overall, [this
[ev]{.mark}idence [shows a]{.mark} **relatively [robust
association]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} changes in [globalization
and]{.mark} changes in [military expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
other words, [[countries experiencing]{.mark} greater [globalization
have]{.mark} relatively **[large increases in
militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the past 20 years.¶ However,
it has been shown that [globalization may not lead to more peaceful
relations or demilitarization]{.underline}. As we discussed in Sect. 2,
[[bilateral trade increases the]{.mark} opportunity [cost of bilateral
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and may hinder bilateral war.
[[Globalization]{.underline}]{.mark} (equivalent to multilateral
economic openness) **[[reduces this]{.mark} opportunity [cost with
any]{.mark} given [country]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and devitalize the
incentive to make concessions during negotiations]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, **[[increases the probability of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** between any given pair of country. Thus, an
increase in trade or openness between two countries may restore peace
between those but may increase the probability of conflict with third
countries.¶ 6 Conclusion¶ While [previous studies]{.underline} mostly
focused on the causal nexus between military expenditure and economic
growth, those studies [have not considered the role of
globalization]{.underline}. This study uses data from the top 15
military expenditure spenders over the period 1990--2012 to examine the
relationship between militarism and globalization. The bootstrap panel
Granger causality that accounts for both cross-sectional dependence and
heterogeneity across countries is utilized to detect the direction of
causality. The results show that [military expenditures and
globalization are causally related in most of the countries under
review]{.underline}. Despite the increasing role of globalization, the
results show that [**[military expenditures are growing]{.mark}** and
[pointing to a strengthening in]{.mark} nationalist sentiments and
[militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper suggests that changes in
domestic political and economic conditions might hinder the process of
globalization. The results are consistent with those of Acemoglu and
Yared (2010) who conclude that high military spending endangers
globalization. This study also supports the results of Martin et al.
(2008) who find that [an increase in multilateral trade raises the
chance of conflict between states]{.underline}. The policy implication
of the findings is that greater military spending by a country increases
the likelihood of military conflict in the future, the anticipation of
which discourages globalization.

### Impact Run\-\--2NC

#### Growth ensures [extinction]{.underline}:

#### Insect loss

environmental journalist for over fifty publications, 3/27/18, "Insect
Decimation Upstages Global Warming,"
https://www.transcend.org/tms/2018/04/insect-decimation-upstages-global-warming/

Everybody's heard about [global warming]{.underline}. It [is one of the
most advertised **existential** events]{.underline} of all time. Who
isn't aware? However, there's a new kid on the block. [An alarming
[**loss of insects** will]{.mark} likely **[take down humanity]{.mark}**
before global warming]{.underline} hits maximum velocity.¶ For the
immediate future, the [Paris]{.underline} Accord [is riding the wrong
horse]{.underline}, as global warming is a long-term project compared to
the insect catastrophe happening right now! Where else is found 40% to
90% species devastation?¶ [The worldwide loss of insects is simply
staggering with some reports of 75% up to 90%, [happening]{.mark} much
[faster than]{.mark} the paleoclimate record rate of the [past]{.mark}
five major [extinction events]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is possible that
some insect species may]{.underline} **[already be close to total
extinction!]{.underline}**¶ [It's established that species evolve and
then go extinct over thousands and millions]{.underline} of years as
part of nature's course, [but the current rate of devastation is simply
"off the charts, and downright scary."]{.underline}¶ Without any doubt,
[it is difficult to imagine how humanity survives without
insects,]{.underline} which are dropping dead in bunches right before
our eyes. For proof, how many insect splats do people clean off
windshields nowadays? Not many.... How many fireflies do children chase
at night? Not many....¶ Several naturalists and environmental writers
believe [the massive [loss]{.mark} of insects [has everything to do
with]{.mark} three generations of **[industrial]{.mark}ized
[farming]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the vast tide of
**[poisons]{.mark}** pouring over the landscape
year-after-year]{.underline}, especially since the end of WWII. [Ours is
the first-ever pesticide-based agricultural society]{.underline}.
Dreadfully, [it's an experiment that is going dead wrong]{.underline}...
all of a sudden!¶ [[Insects are basic to]{.mark} thousands of [food
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}; for example, the disappearance of Britain's
farmland birds by over 50% in 40 years. Additionally, North America and
Europe species of birds like larks, swallows, and swifts that feast on
flying insects have plummeted.¶ But, these are only a few of many, many
recorded examples of massive numbers of wildlife dropping dead right
before our eyes.¶ Significantly, [insects are [the **primary source for
ecosystem creation**]{.mark} **and support**]{.underline}. [[The world
literally crumbles]{.mark} apart [without]{.mark} mischievous burrowing,
[forming new soil, aerating soil, pollinating]{.mark} food
[crops]{.mark}]{.underline}, etc. **[Nutrition for humans happens
because insects pollinate]{.underline}**.

[[Deforestation and forest degradation are]{.underline}]{.mark}

vital that]{.underline} the issues of [deforestation and forest
degradation are tackled thoroughly]{.underline}, however, it can only be
achieved through close cooperation amongst all UN member nations.

#### Chemical emissions 

Julian **Cribb 17**, Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological
Sciences and Engineering, 2017, "The Poisoner," in Surviving the 21st
Century, p. 113-117

There are two essential points about [[the]{.mark} Earthwide **[chemical
flood]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First it [is quite **new**]{.underline}.
[It began with the industrial revolution]{.underline} of the late
nineteenth century, [but expanded dramatically in the wake of the two
world wars]{.underline}---where chemicals were extensively used in
munitions---and has exploded in deadly earnest in the past 50 years,
attaining a new crescendo in the early twenty-first century. [It is
something our ancestors never faced]{.underline}---[and to which
we]{.underline}, in consequence, [lack any protective adaptations which
might otherwise have evolved due to constant exposure to
poisons]{.underline}. ¶ Second, the toxic flood is, for the most part,
preventable. It is not compulsory---but **[[is a]{.mark}n unwanted
by-[product of]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Though
driven by powerful industries and interests, it still lies within the
powers and rights of citizens, consumers and their governments to demand
it be curtailed or ended and to encourage industry to safer, healthier
products and production systems. ¶ The issue is whether, or not, a wise
humanity would choose to continue poisoning our children, ourselves and
our world. ¶ Regulatory Failure ¶ [Despite the fact that around 2000 new
chemicals are released onto world markets annually, most have not
received proper health, safety or environmental
screening]{.underline}---especially in terms of their impact on babies
and small children. [[Regulation has]{.mark} so far [failed]{.mark} to
make any serious curtailment of this flood:]{.underline} only 21 out of
144,000 known chemicals have been banned internationally, and this has
not eliminated their use. At such a rate of progress [it will take us
more than 50,000 years to identify and prohibit or restrict all the
chemicals which do us harm]{.underline}. Even then, bans will only apply
in a handful of well-regulated countries, and will not protect the Earth
system nor humanity at large. Clearly, national regulation holds few
answers to what is now an out-of-control global problem. ¶ Furthermore,
[the chemical industry is relocating from the developed
world]{.underline} (where it is quite well regulated and observes its
own ethical standards) [and into developing countries]{.underline},
mainly in Asia, where it is largely beyond the reach of either ethics or
the law. However, [its [toxic emissions return]{.mark} to citizens in
well-regulated countries [via wind, water, food, wildlife,]{.mark}
consumer [goods]{.mark}, industrial products [and
people]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The bottom line is that it doesn't
matter how good your country's regulations are: you and your family are
still exposed to a growing global flood of toxins from which even a
careful diet and sensible consumer choices cannot fully protect you. ¶
The wake-up call to the world about the risks of chemical contamination
was issued by American biologist Rachel Carson when she published Silent
Spring in 1962, in which she warned specifically about the impact of
certain persistent pesticides used in agriculture. Since her book came
out, the volume of pesticide use worldwide has increased 30-fold, to
around four million tonnes a year in the mid-2010s. Since the modern
chemical age began there has been a string of high-profile chemical
disasters: Minamata, the Love Canal, Seveso, Bhopal, Flixborough, Oppau,
Toulouse, Hinkley, Texas City, Jilin, Tianjin. Most of these display a
familiar pattern of unproductive confrontation between angry citizens,
industry and regulators, involving drawn-out legal battles that deliver
justice to nobody. By their spectacular and local nature, such events
serve to distract from the far larger, more insidious and ubiquitous,
universal toxic flood. ¶ Chemists and chemical makers often claim that
their products are 'safe' because individual exposure (e.g. in a given
product, like a serve of food) is too low to result in a toxic dose, a
theory first put forward by the mediaeval scholar Paracelsus in the
sixteenth century. This 'dose related' argument is disingenuous, if not
dishonest---as modern chemists well know---for the following reasons:
Most chemicals target a receptor or receptors on certain of your body
cells, to cause harm. There may be not one, but hundreds or even
thousands of different chemicals all targeting the same receptor, so a
particular substance may contribute an unknowable fraction to an overall
toxic dose. That does not make it 'safe'. Chemicals not known to be
poisonous in small doses on their own can combine with other substances
in water, air, food or your body to create a toxin. No manufacturer can
truthfully assert this will not happen to their products. Chemical
toxicity is a function of both dose and the length of time you are
exposed to it. In the case of persistent chemicals and heavy metals,
this exposure may occur over days, months, years, even a lifetime in
some cases. Tiny doses may thus accumulate into toxic ones. Most
chemical toxicity is still measured on the basis of an exposed adult
male. Babies and children being smaller and using much more water, food
and air for their bodyweight, are therefore more at risk of receiving a
poisonous dose than are adults. ¶ Chemicals and minerals are valuable
and extremely useful. They do great good, save many lives and much
money. No-one is suggesting they should all be banned. But their value
may be for nothing if the current uncontrolled, unmonitored, unregulated
and unconscionable mass release and planetary saturation continues.¶
Chemical Extinction ¶ Two billion years ago, [excessive production of
one particular poisonous chemical by the inhabitants of Earth caused a
colossal die-off and threatened the **extermination of all
life**]{.underline}. That chemical was oxygen and it was excreted by the
blue-green algae which then dominated the planet, as part of their
photosynthetic processes. After several hundred million of years, the
planet's physical ability to soak up the surplus O2 in iron formations,
oceans and sediments had reached saturation and the gas began to poison
the existing life. [This event was known as the 'oxygen holocaust', and
is probably the nearest life on Earth has ever come to complete disaster
before the present]{.underline} (Margulis and Sagan 1986). Since it
developed slowly, over tens of millions of years, the poisonous
atmosphere permitted some of these primitive organisms to evolve a
tolerance to O2---and this in time led to the rise of oxygen-dependent
species such as fish, mammals and eventually, us. The takehome learning
from this brush with total annihilation is that [[it is possible]{.mark}
for living creatures [to **pollute** ]{.mark}**themselves [into
oblivion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if they don't take care to avoid it or
rapidly adapt to the new, toxic environment. [It's a message that
humans, with our colossal planetary chemical impact, would do well to
ponder]{.underline}. ¶ While it is unlikely that human [chemical
emissions]{.underline} alone could reach such a volume and toxic state
as to directly threaten our entire species with extinction (other than
through carbon emissions in a runaway global warming event) or even the
collapse of civilization, it is likely they [will emerge as a serious
contributing factor during the twenty-first century in combination with
other factors such as war, climate change, pandemic disease and
ecosystem breakdown.]{.underline} [Credible [ways]{.mark} in which
man-made [chemicals]{.mark} might [imperil the]{.mark} human [future
include:]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Undermining]{.mark} the [immune
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [physical and mental health]{.underline}
of the population through growing exposure to toxins Reducing the
intelligence of current and future generations through the action of
nerve poisons on the developing brains and central nervous systems of
children, [[rendering humanity less able to solve]{.mark} its
[problems]{.mark} and adapt to major changes;]{.underline} [and by
increasing the level of violent crime and conflict in
society,]{.underline} which is closely linked to lower IQ. Bringing down
the economy through the massive healthcare costs of having to nurse,
treat and maintain a growing proportion of the population disabled by
lifelong chronic chemical exposure. [By [poisoning]{.mark} the
[ecosystem services]{.mark}]{.underline}---[clean air, water, soil,
plants, insects and wildlife---[on which **humanity depends**]{.mark}
**for its own survival**]{.underline} [and thereby [contributing
to]{.mark} potential [global ecosystem breakdown]{.mark}]{.underline} By
augmenting the global arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and hence
the risk of their use by nations or uncontrollable fanatics.

#### Phosphorous depletion 

Charly **Faradji 16**, Doctor of Philosophy Student, Chemistry,
University of Bristol, "How the great phosphorus shortage could leave us
short of food," 2/17/16,
https://phys.org/news/2016-02-great-phosphorus-shortage-short-food.html

It\'s not as well-known as the other issues, but [phosphorus depletion
is]{.underline} no less [significant]{.underline}. After all, we could
live without cars or unusual species, but [if phosphorus ran out we\'d
have to **live without food**]{.underline}.¶ [[Phosphorus is]{.mark} an
**[essential]{.mark} nutrient [for all]{.mark} forms of
[life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is a key element in our DNA and all
living organisms require daily phosphorus intake to produce energy. It
cannot be replaced and [[there is no]{.mark} synthetic
[substitute]{.mark}]{.underline}: [without phosphorus, there is no
life]{.underline}.¶ Our dependence began in the mid-19th century, after
farmers noticed spreading phosphorus-rich guano (bird excrement) on
their fields led to impressive improvements in crop yields. Soon after,
mines opened up in the US and China to extract phosphate ore -- rocks
which contain the useful mineral. This triggered the current use of
mineral fertilisers and, without this industrial breakthrough, humanity
could only produce half the food that it does today.¶ [Fertiliser
[use]{.mark} has [quadrupled]{.mark} over the past half century [and
will **continue rising**]{.mark} as the population expands]{.underline}.
The [**[growing wealth of developing countries]{.underline}** [allows
people]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to afford]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[meat]{.mark} which has [a \"phosphorus footprint]{.mark}\" [50
times]{.mark} higher than [most vegetables]{.mark}]{.underline}. This,
together with the increasing usage of biofuels, is estimated to double
the demand for phosphorus fertilisers by 2050.¶ Today phosphorus is also
used in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, flame retardants,
catalysts for chemical industries, building materials, cleaners,
detergents and food preservatives.¶ Phosphorus is not a renewable
resource¶ Reserves are limited and not equally spread over the planet.
The only large mines are located in Morocco, Russia, China and the US.
Depending on which scientists you ask, the world\'s phosphate rock
reserves will last for another 35 to 400 years -- though the more
optimistic assessments rely on the discovery of new deposits.¶ It\'s a
big concern for the EU and other countries without their own reserves,
and [[phosphorus depletion]{.mark} could [lead to **geopolitical
tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back in 2008, [[when fertiliser
prices]{.mark} sharply [increased]{.mark}]{.underline} by 600% and
directly influenced food prices, [[there were **violent riots**]{.mark}
in 40 different developing countries]{.underline}.¶ Phosphorus also
harms the environment. Excessive fertiliser use means it leaches from
agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea, leading to
so-called dead zones where most fish can\'t survive. Uninhibited algae
growth caused by high levels of phosphorus in water has already created
more than 400 coastal death zones worldwide. Related human poisoning
costs US\$2.2 billion dollars annually in the US alone.¶ With the
increasing demand for phosphorus leading to massive social and
environmental issues, it\'s time we looked towards more sustainable and
responsible use.¶ There is still hope¶ [In the past, the phosphorus
cycle was closed]{.underline}: crops were eaten by humans and livestock
while their faeces were used as natural fertilisers to grow crops
again.¶ [These days, the cycle is broken]{.underline}. Each year 220m
tonnes of phosphate rocks are mined, but only a negligible amount makes
it back into the soil. Crops are transported to cities and the waste is
not returned to the fields but to the sewage system, which mainly ends
up in the sea. A cycle has become a linear process.¶ [[We could reinvent
a]{.mark} modern [phosphorus cycle]{.mark} simply [by **dramatically
reducing**]{.mark} **our [consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all,
less than a third of the phosphorus in fertilisers is actually taken up
by plants; the rest accumulates in the soil or is washed away. To take
one example, in the Netherlands there is enough phosphorus in the soil
today to supply the country with fertiliser for the next 40 years.

## 2NC\-\--Transition

### Transition Forced

#### Transition will be forced\-\--crisis causes degrowth even if unintended by involuntarily ending growth

Giorgos **Kallis 18**, ICREA Research Professor at Universitat Autònoma
de Barcelona, environmental scientist working on ecological economics
and political ecology, formerly Marie Curie International Fellow at the
Energy and Resources Group of the University of California at Berkeley,
PhD in Environmental Policy and Planning from the University of the
Aegean in Greece, et al., 5/31/18, "Annual Review of Environment and
Resources: Research On Degrowth," Annual Review of Environment and
Resources, Vol. 43, p. 308-309

The fate of such openings will play out amid coevolutionary processes
involving institutional organization, technology, environmental
conditions, values, and knowledge (149). [[Although]{.mark} current
[worlds seem trapped]{.mark} in continuity, **[history is rife with
surprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [fueled by the incessant creativity of
humans and their ability to come up with new ways of seeing the world
and new forms of living]{.underline} and producing their societies and
their environments (150). ¶ From this perspective, recent
[[debate]{.mark}s [on]{.mark} the possibility of [voluntary]{.mark}
paths to [degrowth versus the **more probable
event**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of **forced reductions**]{.mark}
[provoked by]{.mark} an involuntary [crash]{.mark}]{.underline} (10, 77)
[[is misleading]{.underline}]{.mark} (78). [Change is always voluntary
and is always enacted through unchosen conditions]{.underline} (such as
the availability of fossil fuels or the thermodynamics of production
processes). History is shaped by collective action or inaction.
[[As]{.mark} economic [growth falters and]{.mark} as the toll of its
limits and [costs becomes unbearable, a
**transition**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the direction of something [[akin
to]{.mark} [degrowth could emerge from]{.mark} dynamics among
[unforeseeable reactions]{.mark}, experiments, [adaptations, and
political struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Such a [transition does not
have to be in the name of degrowth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As with the
eco-communes of Barcelona that Cattaneo & Gavalda (107) studied, the
reduction of resource use can be the outcome of broader processes of
social transformation driven by an ambition to co-live autonomously and
democratically (1). ¶ [In contexts where [life under growth is already
**disastrous**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for many]{.mark} people, [and
threatens]{.mark} to become even [more]{.mark} so [with **climate
change**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the **[overshooting of
planetary boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [literature
reviewed]{.underline} here studies, envisages, and [advocates changes in
institutions, policies, values, understandings, and everyday modes of
living]{.underline}. Without the voluntary work to conceive and embody
alternative ideas, explanations, practices, and institutions today,
**[[an involuntary end to growth may]{.mark} well [lead to a state of
continual economic depression]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in which islands
of wealth are sustained in seas of deprivation]{.underline}, without
pretense of democracy and social justice.

#### Even if it isn't ideal, recession can prompt degrowth\-\--2008 laid the foundations and it's better than overshooting planetary boundaries

Ernest **Garcia 17**, Professor of Sociology at the University of
Valencia, Mercedes Martinez-Iglesias, associate professor and research
technician at the University of Valencia, 2017, "Towards the Post-Carbon
Society: Searching for Signs of the Transition and Identifying
Obstacles," in Transitioning to a Post-Carbon Society, p. 76-80

Hence, the decarbonization---or rather, the [reduction in the
consumption of fossil fuels and]{.underline} the [emission]{.underline}
of greenhouse gases---that [has occurred]{.underline} in Spain [since
the start of the crisis in 2007]{.underline} must not be regarded as a
one-off and transient phenomenon, but as a path that will perdure
throughout time, albeit with ups and downs. Moreover, in the time frame
under analysis, [[decarbonization has been accompanied by]{.mark} other
phenomena]{.underline} (degrowth, **[[economic
recession]{.underline}]{.mark}** and social crisis), raising the
question of whether this association is inherent or accidental.¶ Figure
3.2 noted that the association between decarbonization, on the one hand,
and social cohesion, on the other, appears to be relatively accidental,
at least in the initial phases of the process. The trajectories of the
way down will exhibit varying degrees of equality, as determined by
political and economic decisions, which are at least partly independent
of ecological constraints.¶ In terms of the relationship between
decarbonization and degrowth, let us note that degrowth can be defined
both as the process in which a system becomes smaller and the result of
this process. For this analysis, [degrowth is the strictly physical
component of the way down that must result from a state of
**overshoot**]{.underline}. Hence, [degrowth is not a moral, political
or aesthetic option]{.underline} for individuals to choose based on
their ideological preferences; [it is simply part of what happens when a
system overshoots its limits]{.underline}. In the words of Daly,
degrowth "arises from the recognition that the present scale of the
economy is too large to be maintained in a steady-state", adding that
this "is almost certainly true" (2014: 234). In the current crisis
facing Spain, decarbonization has been associated with some features of
degrowth, namely the stagnation and even reduction in the population,
economic recession and a fall in the national consumption of materials
(see Fig. 3.1). The data on decarbonization points in the same direction
and, leaving to one side the matter of technological innovation, which
at any rate is currently unpredictable, [it seems unlikely the
post-carbon transition will not lead to degrowth on a physical scale in
one way or another]{.underline}.¶ (As an aside, it is worth noting that
the concept of degrowth suggested in the paragraph above does not
coincide exactly with that used by the majority of the movement's
adherents in Spain and France. [For many, degrowth is a voluntary
choice]{.underline}, essentially a political decision that aims to
increase people's well-being and is inherently anti-capitalist, ideas
often expressed by the phrase: "their recession is not our degrowth".
[For the purposes of our analysis, however,]{.underline} [**[degrowth is
an involuntary effect]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[overshoot]{.mark}, which may manifest in benign or malignant ways and
is relatively independent of the economic and political
system]{.underline}. In our opinion, [[it would be better to
accept]{.mark} the possibility of **[different types of
degrowth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, using an appropriate qualifier, such as
convivial, sustainable or benign, to identify the most desirable.
Furthermore, we also believe it is important to point out that since
2007, Spain has witnessed a particular form of degrowth that has shown,
at least temporarily, that it is not incompatible with capitalism,
however---and this is a point on which we agree with activists---the
combination of the two bears all the hallmarks of a disastrous
partnership.)¶ [This leaves]{.underline} the [question of whether the
post-carbon transition must necessarily imply economic
recession]{.underline}, as has been the case since 2007. [Given the
historically close relationship between **economic growth and energy
consumption**]{.underline} (Krausmann et al. 2009), [given that their
eventual **[decoupling has limits that cannot be
overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Tverberg 2015), [[and given]{.mark} the
[absence of]{.mark} similarly abundant, concentrated, versatile and
economic [alternatives to fossil fuels]{.mark} at present]{.underline}
(Hall and Day 2009; McCluney 2005), in principle, [the answer must be
affirmative: **[the]{.mark} post-carbon [transition and]{.mark} economic
[growth are]{.mark} largely [incompatible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, how we conceive this incompatibility depends on our perceptions
of the contribution made by GDP growth to well-being, which leads to the
second of the perspectives mentioned at the start of this section¶ In
our opinion, the particularly convulsive nature of the crisis that began
in 2007 and the acute imbalances of the preceding period of expansion
dating back to 1995 show that, in terms of its contribution to
wellbeing, GDP growth has reached its limits. As Daly (2014) notes,
growth has now become uneconomic. Calculations of the Genuine Progress
Indicator for the wealthiest countries show the social and environmental
costs of increasing GDP have outstripped the associated benefits for
quite some time, with the concomitant loss in net well-being (Talberth
et al. 2007). It has been calculated that, in terms of the global
economy, GDP growth and increasing well-being exhibit a strong
correlation until \$7,000 per capita, tending to stagnate above this
level (Kubiszewski et al. 2013). Another indicator, the Happy Planet
Index, shows that the greatest balance between life satisfaction and
environmental costs is not found in the wealthiest or poorest countries
(NEF 2012). These new indicators, which have been devised by ecological
economists, attempt to put into practice the philosophical foundations
laid by Illich (2004), who, quite some time ago, argued that development
tends to reach a point at which it becomes counter-productive.¶
Generally speaking, this should come as no surprise. We experience
well-being when we feel our needs are satisfied, and there are three
spheres of satisfaction. The first is the economic: goods and services
produced and distributed by the market or the state (e.g. food, clothes,
furniture, education received at schools and medical care provided in
hospitals). The second is non-mercantile, non-bureaucratized
relationships that provide us with care, love, identity and social
recognition. The third is the useful functions of nature, such as the
air we breathe, the water we drink and sunlight, which are not---and
cannot---be produced. Viewed thus, development is precisely the growth
of the economic sphere at the expense of the others, since it only
results in well-being when economic goods and services are scarce and
the contributions from the other two spheres are in relative abundance,
ceasing to do so when this is no longer the case. Hence, [the fixation
on GDP growth leads to increasingly short-lived, imbalanced and
environmentally destructive phases of expansion, accompanied by
increasingly convulsive, deep and prolonged episodes of
contraction]{.underline}. The obsession with growth demands an
exhausting effort to, at best, preserve the status quo.¶ The connection
between an imminent way down and the exhaustion of the positive
contributions of economic growth is essential to understanding the
conditions under which the post-carbon transition can take place.¶ The
three empirical analyses presented in this paper show how the crisis has
created considerable difficulties to a smooth transition. [[The first
steps]{.mark} to decarbonization [have been accompanied by]{.mark}
**economic [stagnation]{.mark}**,]{.underline} increased inequality and
considerable political tensions. A significant part of the population,
almost certainly the majority, is unable to conceive of a different
future, their imagination stymied by the difficulties of a present
characterized by unemployment, insecurity and social cuts. Furthermore,
even though the loss of purchasing power reduces the environmental
impact of consumption, it results in a model of production and
distribution that is essentially unsustainable.¶ [In theory, the way
down that will form the context of the post-carbon [transition may come
in]{.mark} one of two forms: **[a sudden and catastrophic
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that takes the form of an abrupt and
intense simplification]{.underline} that may even give rise to an
uninterrupted spiral of deterioration and conflict that endangers the
continuity of civilized life; [or a consciously assumed, collectively
led and politically controlled reorganization]{.underline} that results
in a more modest, less globalized and less accelerated society than at
present, albeit one that remains compatible with a certain level of
material well-being and complex, democratic political structures
(Diamond 2005; Heinberg 2004, 2011). **[In practice]{.underline}**,
however, [the descent will follow]{.underline} geographically and
socially diverse [paths between these extremes]{.underline}.¶ It is
impossible to make predictions in this respect. By studying the present,
[we can glimpse the features of a context that favours a sudden collapse
in the midst of repeatedly frustrated illusions of
"recoveries".]{.underline} In principle, this scenario would appear in
no way favourable to a conscious and controlled change, and much less to
a prosperous way down or happy degrowth. The belief that the solution to
all our social problems begins with recovering strong GDP growth is the
only point on which all the current economic and political actors in
Europe, from Syriza to the Troika, appear to coincide, a consensus which
anchors politics to a space that abounds in risk.¶ Indeed, recent years
have seen the emergence of a consensus we believe to be extremely
deceiving, one in which austerity is viewed as bad and can be rejected,
while growth is good and desirable. It is a consensus that identifies
austerity with pay cuts and the loss of jobs and social rights, instead
of renouncing the superfluous in order to sustain and guarantee the
necessary, a consensus which, against all the evidence of the last two
or three decades, views growth as the only solution to unemployment,
precariousness and the impoverishment of workers. This consensus, in its
own right, constitutes a powerful obstacle to a smooth post-carbon
transition that is able to avoid, if possible, a catastrophic collapse.¶
[[Given]{.mark} industrial [society is]{.mark} now
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}, or is extremely close to, **[[a state of
overshoot]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [given that this inevitably implies
the advent of a historical era that will be defined by the way down,
[and]{.mark} given [that this]{.mark} way down [implies degrowing to a
level determined by]{.mark} the **[carrying capacity]{.mark}** of the
planet]{.underline}, [the [collective]{.mark} and positive
[reconstruction of austerity is]{.mark} much [more important
than]{.mark} ad nauseam [repetitions of]{.mark} a **[magical faith in
unlimited growth]{.mark} on a finite planet**]{.underline}.

### Benefits OWs War

#### [They can win]{.underline} that wars occur and post-collapse might be worse, but the [benefits]{.underline} of the [chance]{.underline} of transitioning [still outweigh]{.underline}

Programs, University of Melbourne, and research fellow, Melbourne

Alternative: Debating Strategies of Transition," Simplicity Institute,
<http://simplicityinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The-Deep-Green-Alternative.pdf>

[As industrial civilisation continues its global expansion]{.underline}
and pursues growth without apparent limit, [the possibility of
economic]{.underline}, political, or ecological [crises]{.underline}
[forcing an alternative way of life upon humanity]{.underline} [seems to
be growing in likelihood]{.underline} (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 2013). That
is, [[if]{.mark} the [existing]{.mark} model of global [development is
not stopped]{.mark}]{.underline} via one of the pathways reviewed above,
or some other strategy, then it seems clear enough that [at some point
in the future]{.underline}, [[industrial civilisation will]{.mark} grow
itself [to death]{.mark}]{.underline} (Turner, 2012). Whether
\'collapse\' is initiated by an ecological tipping point, a financial
breakdown of an overly indebted economy, a geopolitical disruption, an
oil crisis, or some confluence of such forces, the possibility of
collapse or deep global crisis can no longer be dismissed merely as the
intellectual playground for \'doomsayers\' with curdled imaginations.
[Collapse is a prospect that ought to be taken seriously based on the
logic of limitless growth on a finite planet]{.underline}, [as well as
the evidence of existing]{.underline} economic, ecological, or more
specifically [climatic instability]{.underline}. As Paul Gilding (2011)
has suggested, perhaps it is already too late to avoid some form of
\'great disruption\'.

[[Could collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} or deep crisis [[be the most
likely pathway to]{.mark} an [alternative]{.mark} way of
[life]{.mark}?]{.underline} If it is, such a scenario must not be
idealised or romanticised. Fundamental [[change through crisis
would]{.mark} almost certainly [involve]{.mark}]{.underline} [[great
suffering]{.mark} for many]{.underline}, [and [quite
possibly]{.mark}]{.underline} significant population decline through
[starvation, disease, or [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline}
also [possible]{.underline} [that the \'alternative system\' that a
crisis produces is equally or even more undesirable than the existing
system]{.underline}. [[Nevertheless]{.mark}, it may be that [this is the
only way]{.mark} a [post-growth]{.mark} or post-industrial way of life
[will]{.mark} ever [arise]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Cuban oil crisis,
prompted by the collapse of the USSR, provides one such example of a
deep societal transition that arose not from a political or social
movement, but from sheer force of circumstances (Piercy et al, 2010).
Almost [overnight [Cuba had]{.mark} a large proportion of [its oil
supply cut off]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [forcing the nation to
move]{.underline}]{.mark} [away [from]{.mark} oil-dependent,
[industrialised]{.mark} modes of [food production]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
instead [take up]{.mark} local and [organic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}
[- or perish]{.underline}. David Holmgren (2013) has recently published
a deep and provocative essay, \'Crash on Demand\', exploring the idea
that a relatively small anti-consumerist movement could be enough [to
destabilise the global economy which is already struggling]{.underline}.
This [presents one means of bringing an end to the status quo by
inducing a voluntary crisis]{.underline}, without relying on a mass
movement. Needless to say, should people adopt such a strategy, it would
be imperative to \'prefigure\' the alternative society as far as
possible too, not merely withdraw support from the existing society.

Again, one must not romanticise such theories or transitions. [The
[Cuba]{.mark}n crisis,]{.underline} for example, [entailed much
hardship. But it does [expose]{.mark} the [mechanisms by
which]{.mark}]{.underline} [[crisis can induce significant societal
change]{.underline}]{.mark} [in ways that, in the end, are not always
negative]{.underline}. [[In the face of a *global*
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} or breakdown, therefore, it could be that
[elements of [the deep green vision]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as
organic agriculture, frugal living, sharing, radical recycling, post-oil
transportation, etc.) [[come to be forced upon
humanity]{.mark},]{.underline} [in which case [the]{.mark} question of
[strategy has]{.mark}]{.underline} [less [to do with]{.mark} avoiding a
deep crisis or collapse]{.underline} ([which may be
inevitable]{.underline}) [and more to do with]{.underline} [[negotiating
the descent]{.mark} as [wisely]{.mark} as possible]{.underline}. This is
hardly a reliable path to the deep green alternative, but it presents
itself as a possible path.

#### The post-growth paradigm is gaining critical mass\-\--paradigm shifts can be [incredibly rapid]{.underline} once they reach key thresholds

Paradigm Shift in Progress,"
<http://www.sustainable.unimelb.edu.au/files/mssi/Post-Growth%20Economics.pdf>

[Despite the dominance of this growth model of progress around the
world]{.underline}, [it has never been without its critics,
and]{.underline} as this paper will outline, [there are reasons to
think]{.underline} that [grounds for [opposition are growing in number,
strength, and sophistication]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was the
philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn (1962), who argued that [paradigm
shifts in the natural sciences occur when the existing paradigm finds
itself increasingly unable to solve the critical problems it sets for
itself.]{.underline} [[As anomalies increase]{.mark} in number and
severity]{.underline}, [[the need for]{.mark} [an alternative]{.mark}
paradigm [becomes clearer]{.mark}, and eventually a new paradigm is
developed]{.underline} that can solve more problems than the old one. At
that stage a paradigm shift is set in motion, and over time [[the new
paradigm becomes accepted]{.mark} and the old one loses its
influence,]{.underline} [sometimes [quite abruptly]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In much the same way, this paper proposes that [[a paradigm shift
in]{.mark} macro[economics is underway]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [[post-growth]{.mark} economic
[framework]{.mark}]{.underline} [[threatening to]{.underline}
[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark} [critical [anomalies]{.mark} [that seem
irresolvable]{.mark} from [within the]{.mark} existing [growth]{.mark}
[paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}. We will see that [a growing array of
theorists, from various disciplinary backgrounds, are questioning the
feasibility and]{.underline} even the [desirability of continuous
growth]{.underline}, [especially with respect to the most highly
developed regions]{.underline} of the world. Increasingly there is a
call to look 'beyond growth' (see, e.g., Costanza et al, 2014;
Kubiszewski et al, 2013; Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, 2010), [on the
grounds that growth may now be causing the problems it was traditionally
hoped to solve]{.underline}. [Not only can it be argued that
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[post-growth [paradigm shift]{.mark}
[is *in progress*]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems [the fundamental
importance of [this shift]{.mark} lies in the fact that it
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} *[[in relation to]{.mark}
progress]{.underline}*. That is, [it is]{.underline} [[changing]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} very nature of [what 'progress' means]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Crash Key

#### Only a [crash]{.underline} solves [catastrophic climate change]{.underline} and forces a [mindset shift]{.underline} -- that [outweighs]{.underline} recession, but they're [structurally inevitable]{.underline} in the [long term]{.underline} from [financial volatility]{.underline} and [warming]{.underline}

December 27, 2018.
https://grist.org/article/what-the-stock-market-crash-means-for-the-climate/\]

Let's talk about [[the **stock market**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Pretty
terrifying, huh? The big Christmas Eve dip plunged the U.S. markets into
"bear" territory --- with declines of over 20 percent in the past three
months alone. The day after Christmas followed with the largest rally in
market history, half of which evaporated at one point on Thursday, but
then entirely came back by the afternoon. That's a lot of volatility in
a time when the future is pretty volatile already --- that's right, I'm
talking about the climate.

[[For those]{.mark} of us [with]{.mark} more of [a **planetary
perspective**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [what]{.underline}]{.mark} [are we
supposed [to make of this **financial
rollercoaster**]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Politicians have long presented the economy and the environment as
competing issues. And on the surface, the vast majority of people in the
world don't care about the stock market. Nearly half the people in the
world live on less than \$5.50 per day, and it's them who'll bear the
brunt of climate change. When asked, they care much more about climate
change than the economy.

There's evidence that [an [**economic downturn** could be **good for the
planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **rare times** the
**world**]{.underline}]{.mark} [has successfully temporarily stabilized
or **[decreased]{.mark}** annual [**emissions** were]{.mark} during
**economic [recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} like 1990-93 and 2008-09.

[[Recessions]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[**force a rethink** of the
**status quo**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [they [**demand efficiency** and
**innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, [during a recession, [the
economy **must figure out** how to **do more with
less**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That's exactly the challenge we face
now]{.underline} that the [[**science** is **absolutely
clear**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**radical change** is our **only
hope** to **stop climate change** before **irreversible tipping
points**]{.mark} kick in]{.underline}.

But while our capitalistic, growth-based economy is still closely tied
to fossil-fuel use and a sustained downturn would likely reduce
emissions, the whole truth is not so simple. Economic hardship doesn't
just hurt the rich, who are (by far!) the world's biggest carbon
emitters. Economic downturns hit hard in places with large inequality
like Miami and Puerto Rico, which are also slated to bear some of the
biggest burdens of climate change.

Not only would another recession impact unemployment, it could result in
a shift in priority away from long-term challenges (like climate change)
and onto short-term survival. And because governments have a bad habit
of choosing austerity as a tool for cutting spending, it's likely the
rich will try to pass off the burden of their mistakes on the backs of
the working class.

It's impossible to know whether a future economic downturn in the U.S.
would result in a widening gap between rich and poor, popular revolt (as
we recently saw with France's yellow vests), or something else entirely.
But according to the Trump administration's own climate reports, [[there
is]{.mark} a [**strong possibility** of]{.mark}
[long-term]{.mark}]{.underline} **[global [warming-related GDP
shrinkage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even though many people (including me)
have argued that the human costs of climate change are more important
than the monetary ones, that doesn't mean environmentalists can afford
to ignore a possible market downturn. Those hurricanes are going to keep
on coming, and someone has to pay the bills.

[[**Climate change** is **much more terrifying** than a]{.mark}
potential **[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Still]{.underline}, we
SHOULD care about [the [**volatility** of the]{.mark} **stock
[market]{.mark}** and a **looming recession**]{.underline} --- at the
very least, it [[should make us pay attention to]{.mark} the
[**fragility** of **our current system**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
provide excuses for rethinking the way things work.

[**[economy]{.underline}**, [leading to]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as
a [[**3% decline** in]{.underline}]{.mark} national
[[GDP]{.underline}]{.mark} by the end of the 21st century if left
unaddressed --- and losses will be far higher in some of the country's
poorest areas, [[according to a **new study**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Researchers]{.underline}]{.mark} behind the study, published in the
journal Science, [[evaluated]{.mark} a number of factors]{.underline}
that will contribute to economic decline as average global temperatures
continue to rise, including [[increased **energy
costs**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[coastal damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[mortality rates and [damage to
**ag**]{.mark}**riculture**]{.underline}. [The study [authors did not
assess]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[other factors that carry]{.mark}
economic [costs, like]{.mark}]{.underline} damage to
**[[biod]{.underline}]{.mark}**iversity, because such losses can be
difficult to quantify.

The southern U.S. and mid-Atlantic region will face the worst losses,
while some places in the North may actually benefit from higher
temperatures, according to the study. In the places where climate change
hits hardest --- think the entire South from Texas to Florida --- the
economic losses could be nothing short of devastating. In many
locations, GDP decline could total more than 10%, and in the worst-hit
county, Florida's Union County, losses could near 28%.

Predicting the exact consequences of such a climate-fueled recession is
impossible, but researchers say [the [**geographic disparities**

and]{.mark} could [drive]{.mark} **mass

### Impact Defense -- Recession

#### Recessions don't uniquely cause wars

- War can occur at [any stage]{.underline} of expansion, crisis,
  recession, and recovery

- Doesn't happen at one particular stage, despite recessions being quick

- Decision to go to war based on [military gains]{.underline} -- not
  germane to recession

- Econ explanation for war is downward pressure -- happens during
  prosperity because of [unfounded worry]{.underline} for recessions

**Liao 19** \[Jianan Liao, Shenzhen Nanshan Foreign Language School,

First, [[**war can occur** at **any stage** of **expansion**]{.mark},
**[crisis]{.mark}**, **[recession]{.mark}**,
**[recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so [[it is **unrealistic to
assume**]{.mark} that [**wars occur** at **any particular stage** of
the]{.mark} business [cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[**[although]{.mark}** the domestic economic [problems in]{.mark} the
crisis/[recession]{.mark}/depression period [break out]{.mark} and
become prominent [in]{.mark} a **[short time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
fact, [[**such challenge exists** at **all stages** of the]{.mark}
business **[cycle]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When countries cannot manage
to solve these problems through conventional approaches, including
fiscal and monetary policies, they may resort to military expansion to
achieve their goals, a theory known as Lateral Pressure. \[13\] Under
such circumstances, even countries in the period of economic expansion
are facing downward pressure on the economy and may try to solve the
problem through expansion. On the other hand, although the resources
required for foreign wars are huge for countries in economic depression,
the [[**decision to wage wars** **depends** largely on]{.mark} the
[**consideration** of]{.mark} the **[gain and loss of
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even during depression, governments can
raise funding for war by issuing bonds. Argentina, for example, was
mired in economic stagflation before the war on the Malvinas islands
(also known as the Falkland islands in the UK). In fact, many
governments would dramatically increase their expenditure to stimulate
the economy during the recession, and economically war is the same as
these policies, so the claim that a depressed economy cannot support a
war is unfounded. In addition, during the crisis period of the business
cycle, which is the early stage of the economic downturn, despite the
economic crisis and potential depression, the country still retains the
ability to start wars based on its economic and military power. Based on
the above understanding, [[war]{.mark} has [the conditions and reasons
for]{.mark} its [outbreak in all stages of the]{.mark} business
[cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, [[the economic origin for]{.mark} the outbreak of [war is
**downward pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the economy rather than
optimism or competition for monopoly capital, [[which **may exist
during**]{.underline}]{.mark} economic recession or economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is due to a fact that
[**[during]{.mark}** economic **[prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[people are also **worried** about]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic
**[[recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blainey pointed out that wars
often occur in the economic upturn, which is caused by the optimism in
people\'s mind \[14\], that is, the confidence to prevail. This
interpretation linking optimism and war ignores the strength contrast
between the warring parties. Not all wars are equally comprehensive, and
there have always been wars of unequal strength. In such a war, one of
the parties tends to have an absolute advantage, so the expectation of
the outcome of the war is not directly related to the economic situation
of the country. Optimism is not a major factor leading to war, but may
somewhat serve as stimulation. In addition, Lenin attributed the war to
competition between monopoly capital. This theory may seem plausible,
but its scope of application is obviously too narrow. Lenin\'s theory of
imperialism is only applicable to developed capitalist countries in the
late stage of the development capitalism, but in reality, many wars take
place among developing countries whose economies are still at their
beginning stages. Therefore, the theory centered on competition among
monopoly capital cannot explain most foreign wars. Moreover, even wars
that occur during periods of economic expansion are likely to result
from the potential expectation of economic recession, the \"limits of
growth\" \[15\] faced during prosperity --- a potential deficiency of
market demand. So the downward pressure on the economy is the cause of
war.

### Impact D -- Diversionary War

#### No diversionary [war]{.underline} -- they use [rhetoric]{.underline} instead

- Evidence on diversionary war is mixed at best

- They use [hostile rhetoric]{.underline} instead of war to have their
  cake and eat it too -- achieves same benefits without conflict

- Prefer our study because its based on 50,000 US diplomatic events
  classified by interstate interactions across economic crises

International Relations, University of Southern California. Diversionary
Cheap Talk: Unemployment and US Foreign Policy Rhetoric, 1945-2010.

There is a large [[lit]{.mark}erature [on diversionary conflict]{.mark}
in international relations]{.underline}, but it [focuses on material
conflicts like **militarized interstate disputes**]{.underline} [rather
than]{.underline} foreign policy **[rhetoric]{.underline}**. It is based
in social identity theory, which suggests that leaders can increase
ingroup affinity by making intergroup distinctions more salient (Closer,
1950; Simmel, 1955; Tajfel and Turner, 1979). A recent review concludes
that though the internal logic of diversionary conflict is "compelling
and theoretically well supported," the [**empirical evidence**
[is]{.mark} **"decidedly [mixed"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baum and Potte
r, 2008, 48). [Several **studies find evidence** of **diversionary
aggression** in US foreign policy]{.underline} (Clark, 2003; DeRouen,
2000; DeRouen and Peake, 2002; Fordham, 1998a, 6; Hess and Orphanides,
1995; Howell and Pevehouse, 2005; James and Hristoulas, 1994; James and
Oneal, 1991; Levy, 1989«,fc; Morgan and Bickers, 1992; Ostrom and Job,
1986) and elsewhere (Bennett, 2000; Dassel and Reinhardt, 1000; Davies,
2002; Enterline and Gleditsch, 2000; Gelpi, 1997; Heldt, 1999; Lebow,
1981; Mansfield and Snyder, 1995; Oneal and Tir, 2006; Russett, 1990;
Sobek, 2007; Tir, 2010). Yet [**skeptics** have **amassed opposing
evidence**]{.underline} (Chiozza and Gormans, 2003, 2004; Foster and
Palmer, 2006; Gowa, 1998; Johnston, 1998; Leeds and Davis, 1997; Lian
and Oneal, 1993; Meernik, 2000, 2004; Meeraik and Waterman, 1996; Moore
and Lanoue, 2003; Potter, 2007). [Some **cases** are **hard to
reconcile** with the **theory**]{.underline}: in Britain, there were
rallies in the Falklands War and the Gulf War but not in other cases in
which rallies would be expected, such as the Korean, Suez, and Kosovo
wars (Lai and Reiter, 2005). Some go so far as to call diversionary
aggression a "myth" (Meernik and Waterman, 1996).

Others have developed scope conditions for diversionary aggression. It
is more likely between states with pre-standing rivalries (McLaughlin
and Prins, 2004), when leaders are accountable (Carter, 2018; Kisangani
and Pickering, 2011), and in mature democracies, consolidating
autocracies, and transitional polities (Pickering and Kisangani, 2005).
It is less likely when states avoid provoking troubled adversaries
(Clark, 2003; Fordham, 2005; Leeds and Davis, 1997; Miller, 1999).
Diversion appears more likely to produce a rally when supported by
Security Council authorization (Chapman, 2011; Chapman and Reiter,
2004), when the White House draws attention to a dispute (Baker and
Oneal, 2001), and in conditions of media attention, popular leadership,
divided government, non election years, and first terms (Colaresi,
2007). Most recently, scholars have asked whether diversion occurs
outside democracies. They find some autocracies, especially single party
regimes, divert as well (Carter, 2018; Pickering and Kisangani, 2011).

This study extends the logic of diversionary conflict to foreign policy
rhetoric. There is surprisingly little research on rhetoric in
international relations. The international relations literature deems
talk "cheap" (Fearon, 1995; Kydd, 2005). The audience cost literature
considers rhetoric meaningful, but only if it invokes audience costs
through explicit, public threats (Fearon, 1994; Schultz, 2001; Smith,
1998; Tomz, 2007). However, [if foreign policy **rhetoric** can
**activate ingroup identity**, then it may be **appealing** for leaders
who wish to **improve** their **ratings without** incurring the
**substantial risks** of **militarized** interstate
**disputes**]{.underline}. [[While it might be **"outlandish"** for
presidents to engage in]{.mark} the **[impeachable]{.mark} exercise** of
**[diversionary war]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Meernik and Waterman, 1996),
[**[hostile]{.mark}** foreign policy [**rhetoric** is **far
less**]{.mark} **outlandish** a [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To develop a theory of diversionary cheap talk, this paper draws upon
research in political psychology and political communication. These
literatures find persuasive evidence that elite statements influence
citizen beliefs (Behr and Iyengar, 19s.\"); Bennett. Lawrence and
Livingston, 2006; Brody, 1991; Cohen, 1995; Jentleson, 1992; Zaller and
Chiu, 2000). I draw on social identity theory to argue that diversionary
cheap talk highlights intergroup differences between nations and leads
citizens to evaluate their leader favorably. When a leader criticizes
foreigners, she cues ingroup identity, which increases citizens' social
attachment to the nation and to herself as its leader. This is a
"solidarity mechanism," through which "\[c\]ollective group goals and
common group identity are highlighted, norms of group-based altruism are
strengthened, punishment and rejection of defectors are increased, and
perceptions of the in-group and out-group are manipulated" (Halevy,
Bernstein and Sagiv, 2008, 405).

The theory generates observable implications about when leaders use
diversionary cheap talk and who they target. I follow the consensus in
the diversionary conflict literature in focusing on poor economic
conditions as the most important source of public disapproval for
leaders. Low approval ratings limit leaders' ability to advance their
domestic agenda. Therefore, [when the **economy deteriorates**,
**leaders** will **criticize foreign nations** to **improve** their
**approval ratings** and **restore** the **p**olitical **c**apital
necessary for them to govern]{.underline}. Second, a key observation
from social identity theory is that the depth of intergroup differences
is important for group attachment. Therefore, consonant with recent
empirical findings in the diversionary conflict literature (McLaughlin
and Prins, 2004), I expect diversionary rhetoric to be most effective
when it targets threatening outgroups. In the context of foreign policy,
these are best represented by historical adversaries. And finally,
because diversionary cheap talk shifts the focus of political
competition from the partisan to the international level, it has
differential partisan effects. Because national identity cues widen the
tent of the political ingroup, diversionary cheap talk is most effective
at boosting support among the leader's nonpartisans: liberal citizens
for conservative leaders, and conservative citizens for liberal leaders.

[[I test]{.mark} these hypotheses with the **A**merican **D**iplomatic
**D**ataset, an original record of over **[50,000]{.mark} US diplomatic
[events]{.mark}**]{.underline} between 1945 and 2010 drawn from New York
Times articles on foreign affairs. [[I used]{.mark} tools from
[**computational social science** to **classify**]{.mark} bilateral
**[interstate interactions]{.mark}** into hundreds of specific types and
four aggregate categories: **verbal coop**eration, **verbal conflict**,
**material coop**eration, and **material conflict**]{.underline}. [[This
is]{.mark} **by far** [the **most**]{.mark} **historically
[extensive]{.mark}** event **[dataset]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such,
[it allows an exploration of US **foreign policy behavior**
[across]{.mark} a variety of administrations and **[econ]{.mark}omic
[crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[I find **robust evidence** of **diversionary cheap talk**]{.mark} in
**US foreign policy**]{.underline}. First, I establish that [US
**presidents** face **incentives** to **divert verbally rather than
materially**: while militarized interstate dispute initiation does not
affect presidential approval ratings, critical rhetoric about other
nations is associated with increased ratings]{.underline}, especially
among nonpartisans. Responding to this incentive,
[presidents]{.underline} between 1945 and 2010 [typically diverted in
the form of **words, not deeds**]{.underline}. Simulations indicate that
as unemployment varied from its minimum to its maximum observed value,
hostile foreign policy rhetoric nearly doubled, depending on the
administration. Throughout this study, estimates are conservative: I
operationalize conflict as events the United States initiated, although
findings are robust to a redefinition of conflict as events the United
States participated in. The verbal statements in the dataset are high
profile and likely to be noticed by the American public: all appeared in
the headlines of the New York Times.

This study contributes to existing scholarship in several ways. First,
it demonstrates that US foreign policy rhetoric responds significantly
to domestic economic conditions. International relations scholars should
therefore continue to focus more seriously on the communicative aspects
of foreign policy, and in particular its relationship to domestic
politics (Johnston, 2001, 2008; Kurizaki, 2007; Ramsay, 2011; Sartori,
2002, 2005; Trager, 2010, 2011, 201(i). The American Diplomacy Dataset
will enable researchers to further explore the communicative aspects of
foreign policy, and their relationships to material and economic
factors, in more detail than existing datasets permit.

Second, [this study contributes to the diversionary conflict literature
by showing that in many cases where diversionary theory **predicts
conflict** initiation, **leaders instead choose** **rhetorical
hostility**]{.underline}. In this sense, [[leaders]{.mark} may **[have
their cake and eat it too]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[They benefit
from]{.mark} an [**ingroup rally without** inviting]{.mark} an
**international [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [**mixed empirical
findings** in]{.mark} the **[diversionary]{.mark}** conflict
**[lit]{.mark}erature** [may be]{.mark}]{.underline} partly [[**due** to
the fact]{.mark} that existing [scholarship considers **only**]{.mark}
[the most **serious**]{.mark} forms of **[diversion]{.mark}** like
**militarized** interstate **disputes**. It is possible that a **wide
range** of **diversionary behavior** takes place at less extreme levels,
such as]{.underline} the **[rhetoric]{.underline}**al hostility
documented in this paper.1

### No Nuke War

#### No nuke war ever 

**Quinlan 9**---distinguished frmr British defence strategist and former
Permanent Under-Secretary of State. (Michael, Thinking About Nuclear
Weapons, 63-9)

Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, [the
supposition of inexorable momentum in a]{.underline} [developing
exchange, with [each side rushing to overreaction]{.mark} amid confusion
and uncertainty, [is implausible]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It fails to
consider]{.underline} ]{.mark}[what [the situation]{.mark} of the
decisionmakers would really be. Neither side could want
escalation]{.underline}. Both would be appalled at what was going on.
[[Both would]{.mark} be desperately [look]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[for
signs]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the other was ready
to]{.underline}]{.mark} call a [[halt]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both, given
the capacity for evasion or concealment which modern delivery platforms
and vehicles can possess, could have in reserve significant forces
invulnerable enough not to entail use-or-lose pressures. (It may be more
open to question, as noted earlier, whether newer nuclear-weapon
possessors can be immediately in that position; but it is within reach
of any substantial state with advanced technological capabilities, and
attaining it is certain to be a high priority in the development of
forces.) As a result, [neither side can have any predisposition to
suppose, in an ambiguous situation of fearful risk, that the right
course when in doubt is to go on copiously launching
weapons]{.underline}. And [[none of this analysis rests on]{.underline}
[any presumption of]{.underline}]{.mark} [highly subtle or pre-concerted
[rationality]{.mark}. The rationality required is plain.]{.underline}
The argument is reinforced if we consider the possible reasoning of an
aggressor at a more dispassionate level. Any substantial nuclear armoury
can inflict destruction outweighing any possible prize that aggression
could hope to seize. A state attacking the possessor of such an armoury
must therefore be doing so (once given that it cannot count upon
destroying the armoury pre-emptively) on a judgement that the possessor
would be found lacking in the will to use it. If the attacked possessor
used nuclear weapons, whether first or in response to the aggressor\'s
own first use, this judgement would begin to look dangerously
precarious. [[There must be]{.mark} at least [a substantial possibility
of the aggressor]{.mark} leaders\' [concluding that]{.mark} their
initial judgement had been mistaken---that the [risks
were]{.mark}]{.underline} after all [[greater than whatever prize they
had been seeking, and that]{.mark} for their own country\'s survival
[they must call off the aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Deterrence
planning such as that of NATO was directed in the first place to
preventing the initial misjudgement and in the second, if it were
nevertheless made, to compelling such a reappraisal. The former aim had
to have primacy, because it could not be taken for granted that the
latter was certain to work. But there was no ground for assuming in
advance, for all possible scenarios, that the chance of its working must
be negligible. [An aggressor state would itself be at huge risk if
nuclear war developed, as its leaders would know.]{.underline} It may be
argued that a policy which abandons hope of physically defeating the
enemy and simply hopes to get him to desist is pure gamble, a matter of
who blinks first; and that the political and moral nature of most likely
aggressors, almost ex hypothesis, makes them the less likely to blink.
One response to this is to ask what is the alternative---it can only be
surrender. But a more positive and hopeful answer lies in the fact that
the criticism is posed in a political vacuum. Real-life conflict would
have a political context. The context which concerned NATO during the
cold war, for example, was one of defending vital interests against a
postulated aggressor whose own vital interests would not be engaged, or
would be less engaged. Certainty is not possible, but a clear asymmetry
of vital interest is a legitimate basis for expecting an asymmetry,
credible to both sides, of resolve in conflict. That places upon
statesmen, as page 23 has noted, the key task in deterrence of building
up in advance a clear and shared grasp of where limits lie. That was
plainly achieved in cold-war Europe. 11 vital interests have been
defined in a way that is clear, and also clearly not overlapping or
incompatible with those of the adversary, a credible basis has been laid
for the likelihood of greater resolve in resistance. [It
was]{.underline} also sometimes [suggested]{.underline} by critics [that
whatever might be indicated by theoretical discussion of]{.underline}
[political will and interests, the military environment of nuclear
warfare]{.underline}---particularly difficulties of communication and
control---[would drive escalation with overwhelming probability to the
limit]{.underline}. [But it is obscure why matters should be regarded as
inevitably so for every possible level and setting of action. Even if
the history of war suggested (as it scarcely does) that military
decision-makers]{.underline} are mostly apt to [work on the principle
\'When in doubt, lash out\', the nuclear revolution creates an utterly
new situation]{.underline}. The pervasive reality, always plain to both
sides during the cold war, is \'If this goes on to the end, we are all
ruined\'. [Given that inexorable escalation would mean catastrophe for
both, it would be perverse to suppose them permanently incapable of
framing arrangements which avoid it.]{.underline} As page 16 has noted,
NATO gave its military commanders no widespread delegated authority, in
peace or war, to launch nuclear weapons without specific political
direction. [Many types of weapon moreover had physical safeguards such
as PALs incorporated to reinforce organizational ones. There were
multiple communication and control systems for passing information,
orders, and prohibitions.]{.underline} Such systems could not be totally
guaranteed against disruption if at a fairly intense level of strategic
exchange---which was only one of many possible levels of conflict--- an
adversary judged it to be in his interest to weaken political control.
It was far from clear why he necessarily should so judge. Even then,
however, it remained possible to operate on a general fail-safe
presumption: no authorization, no use. That was the basis on which NATO
operated. If it is feared that the arrangements which a nuclear-weapon
possessor has in place do not meet such standards in some respects, the
logical course is to continue to improve them rather than to assume
escalation to be certain and uncontrollable, with all the enormous
inferences that would have to flow from such an assumption. The
likelihood of escalation can never be 100 per cent, and never zero.
Where between those two extremes it may lie can never be precisely
calculable in advance; and even were it so calculable, it would not be
uniquely fixed---it would stand to vary hugely with circumstances. That
there should be any risk at all of escalation to widespread nuclear war
must be deeply disturbing, and decision-makers would always have to
weigh it most anxiously. But a pair of key truths about it need to be
recognized. The first is that the risk of escalation to large-scale
nuclear war is inescapably present in any significant armed conflict
between nuclear-capable powers, whoever may have started the conflict
and whoever may first have used any particular category of weapon. The
initiator of the conflict will always have physically available to him
options for applying more force if he meets effective resistance. If the
risk of escalation, whatever its degree of probability, is to be
regarded as absolutely unacceptable, the necessary inference is that a
state attacked by a substantial nuclear power must forgo military
resistance. It must surrender, even if it has a nuclear armoury of its
own. But the companion truth is that, as page 47 has noted, the risk of
escalation is an inescapable burden also upon the aggressor. [The
exploitation of that burden is the crucial route, if conflict does break
out, for managing it to a tolerable outcome---the only route, indeed,
intermediate between surrender and holocaust, and so the necessary basis
for deterrence beforehand.]{.underline} The working out of plans to
exploit escalation risk most effectively in deterring potential
aggression entails further and complex issues. It is for example plainly
desirable, wherever geography, politics, and available resources so
permit without triggering arms races, to make provisions and
dispositions that are likely to place the onus of making the bigger and
more evidently dangerous steps in escalation upon the aggressor who
wishes to maintain his attack, rather than upon the defender. (The
customary shorthand for this desirable posture used to be \'escalation
dominance\'.) These issues are not further discussed here. But
addressing them needs to start from acknowledgement that there are in
any event no certainties or absolutes available, no options guaranteed
to be risk-free and cost-free. Deterrence is not possible without
escalation risk; and its presence can point to no automatic policy
conclusion save for those who espouse outright pacifism and accept its
consequences. Accident and Miscalculation Ensuring the safety and
security of nuclear weapons plainly needs to be taken most seriously.
Detailed information is understandably not published, but such direct
evidence as there is suggests that it always has been so taken in every
possessor state, with the inevitable occasional failures to follow
strict procedures dealt with rigorously. [Critics]{.underline} have
nevertheless from time to time [argued that the possibility of accident
involving]{.underline} [nuclear weapons is]{.underline} so
[substantial]{.underline} that it must weigh heavily in the entire
evaluation of whether war-prevention structures entailing their
existence should be tolerated at all. Two sorts of scenario are usually
in question. The first is that of a single grave event involving an
unintended nuclear explosion---a technical disaster at a storage site,
for example, or the accidental or unauthorized launch of a delivery
system with a live nuclear warhead. The second is that of some
event---perhaps such an explosion or launch, or some other mishap such
as malfunction or misinterpretation of radar signals or computer
systems---initiating a sequence of response and counter-response that
culminated in a nuclear exchange which no one had truly intended. [No
event that is physically possible can be said to be of absolutely zero
probability]{.underline} (just as at an opposite extreme it is absurd to
claim, as has been heard from distinguished figures, that nuclear-weapon
use can be guaranteed to happen within some finite future span despite
not having happened for over sixty years). [But human affairs cannot be
managed to the standard of]{.underline} either zero or total
[probability]{.underline}. [We have to assess levels
between]{.underline} those [theoretical limits and weigh their reality
and implications against other factors, in security planning as in
everyday life. There have]{.underline} certainly [been]{.underline},
across the decades since 1945, many known [accidents involving nuclear
weapons,]{.underline} from transporters skidding off roads to bomber
aircraft crashing with or accidentally dropping the weapons they carried
(in past days when such carriage was a frequent feature of readiness
arrangements---it no longer is). A few of these accidents may have
released into the nearby environment highly toxic material.
[None]{.underline} however has [entailed a nuclear
detonation]{.underline}. Some commentators suggest that this reflects
bizarrely good fortune amid such massive activity and deployment over so
many years. [A]{.underline} more [rational deduction from the facts of
this long experience would however be that [the probability of any
accident]{.mark} triggering a nuclear explosion [is extremely
low]{.mark}.]{.underline} It might be further noted that the [mechanisms
needed to set off such an explosion]{.underline} [are technically
demanding, and that]{.underline} in a large number of ways [the past
sixty years have seen extensive improvements in safety arrangements for
both the design and the handling of weapons]{.underline}. It is
undoubtedly possible to see respects in which, after the cold war, some
of the factors bearing upon risk may be new or more adverse; but some
are now plainly less so. The years which the world has come through
entirely without accidental or unauthorized detonation have included
early decades in which knowledge was sketchier, precautions were less
developed, and weapon designs were less ultra-safe than they later
became, as well as substantial periods in which weapon numbers were
larger, deployments more widespread and diverse, movements more
frequent, and several aspects of doctrine and readiness arrangements
more tense. [Similar considerations apply to the hypothesis of nuclear
war being mistakenly triggered by false alarm]{.underline}. Critics
again point to the fact, as it is understood, of numerous occasions when
initial steps in alert sequences for US nuclear forces were embarked
upon, or at least called for, by indicators mistaken or misconstrued. In
none of these instances, it is accepted, did matters get at all near to
nuclear launch---extraordinary good fortune again, critics have
suggested. But [[the]{.mark} rival and [more logical inference from
hundreds of events]{.mark} stretching over sixty years of experience
[presents itself]{.mark} once more: that [the probability of
]{.mark}]{.underline}initial [[misinterpretation
leading]{.mark}]{.underline} far [[towards]{.mark} mistaken [launch is
remote]{.mark}. Precisely because any nuclear-weapon possessor
recognizes the vast gravity of any launch,]{.underline} [release
sequences have many steps, and human decision is repeatedly interposed
as well as capping the sequences.]{.underline} [[To convey that because
a first step]{.underline}]{.mark} was prompted [[the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} somehow [[came close to
accidental]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[war is wild hyperbole,]{.mark}
rather like asserting, when a tennis champion has lost his opening
service game, that he was nearly beaten in straight sets]{.underline}.
[[History]{.mark} anyway [scarcely offers any]{.mark} ready [example
of]{.mark} major [war started]{.mark} [by accident]{.mark} [even before
the nuclear revolution imposed]{.mark} an order-of-magnitude [increase
in caution]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was occasionally conjectured that
nuclear war might be triggered by the real but accidental or
[unauthorized launch]{.underline} of a strategic nuclear-weapon delivery
system in the direction of a potential adversary. No such launch is
known to have occurred in over sixty years. [The
probability]{.underline} of it [is]{.underline} therefore [very low. But
even if it did happen, the further hypothesis of its initiating a
general [nuclear]{.mark} [exchange]{.mark} is far-fetched. It fails to
consider the real situation of decision-makers]{.underline}, as pages
63-4 have brought out. [The notion that cosmic holocaust might be
mistakenly precipitated in this way [belongs to science]{.mark}

### Growth Sustainable

**The [consumption mindset]{.underline} is [sustainable]{.underline} and
[good]{.underline}**

**Pyka and Prettner, 18**---Institute of Economics, University of
Hohenheim (Andreas and Klaus, "Economic Growth, Development, and
Innovation: The Transformation Towards a Knowledge-Based Bioeconomy,"
Bioeconomy pp 331-342, springer, dml)

The alternative approach of neo-Schumpeterian economics (e.g., Hanusch
and Pyka 2007) challenges this quantitative orientation and instead
emphasizes the importance of qualitative aspects, which make fundamental
changes of economic structures over longer periods visible. [Without the
consideration of the **qualitative levels** of economic growth, the
quantitative figures **cannot tell much** about the **massive
technological** and **socioeconomic developments**]{.underline}. The
neo-Schumpeterian approach highlights that [[**innovations**, **market
forces**]{.mark}, **structural change**, and **urban ways of life**
[are]{.mark} both **part of the problem** and **[part of the
solution]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the sustainability problem.
[Innovation-triggered development generates both **quantitative**, i.e.,
income-increasing growth, and **qualitative**, i.e., structure-changing
development]{.underline}. [**Only** the creative solutions
**characteristic for [capitalist]{.mark}ic-organized
[economies]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} enable to **[reform our future
economy]{.mark}** in the sense of sustainability]{.underline}, thereby
**[[supporting]{.underline}]{.mark}** the UN's
**[[sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}** goals [and **simultaneously
ensuring growth** and **development**]{.underline} (Mazzucato and Perez
2015).

[The **central role of innovation**]{.underline} in neo-Schumpeterian
economics [highlights that]{.underline} abstinence in the sense of
[**economic [downscaling]{.mark}** [is **neither the first nor the only
solution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This does not mean that all ideas of
the proponents of the camp are rejected: in perfect accordance, certain
past patterns like the high energy intensity of production because of
too low oil prices not covering the total environmental costs or
so-called planned obsolescence in consumption require urgent
adjustments. Especially [concepts resulting in a **more intensive use of
goods** and therefore contributing to [the **economization of
resources**]{.mark} like the sharing economy or displacing physical
goods by digital goods are **promising**. The same applies for
closed-loop material cycles, recycling systems, and intelligent waste
avoidance and treatment. These]{.underline} concepts are perfectly
applicable to **[[foster]{.underline}]{.mark}** learning and
[[**behavioral changes**]{.mark} on the supply and the demand
side]{.underline}. The core idea of neo-Schumpeterian economics,
however, is the supply of and demand for new technological solutions
within a comprehensive economic transformation process (Geels 2002),
i.e., [different goods and services are produced and demanded in
different]{.underline}, namely, [sustainable ways]{.underline}.
[Exploring and exploiting the technological possibilities]{.underline}
of the bioeconomy not only creates new investment opportunities but
[is]{.underline} also [the **condition sine qua non** for the required
socioeconomic and cultural changes]{.underline}. The **[[consumers'
acceptance of]{.underline}]{.mark}** bio-based [[**products** and their
**demand** are **indispensable** ]{.mark}**for a successful
transformation**]{.underline}. Innovations and changed consumer
attitudes are complementary conditions for the creation of a sustainable
production system.

[Change can be either]{.underline} of an [incremental]{.underline} type
in terms of small improvements step-by-step [along well-known
technological trajectories, or it can be fundamental, leading to
structural changes and the emergence of new and the disappearance of old
industries]{.underline}. To simplify, we assume in this chapter that
incremental technological changes are based on existing technological
solutions, whereas radical technological changes question major existing
production processes. They might lead to massive upheaval in the global
production system in the sense of creative destruction (Schumpeter
1943). Because this chapter deals with the fundamental transformation of
current production systems, [**[radical]{.mark} technological
[innovations are]{.mark} in the spotlight** which encompass the
**[overcoming]{.mark} of the lock-in situation in [fossil
fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Unruh 2000) [and the **establishment of a
knowledge-based bioeconomy**]{.underline} (Pyka 2017; Pyka and Buchmann
2016). Without doubt [this transformation process is **radical**,
**qualitative**, and **long term**]{.underline}. It was already in
Business Cycles, published in 1939, when Schumpeter revitalized
Kondratieff's theory of long waves in order to explain such processes as
regular processes in long-term economic development. His illustration of
the discontinuous nature of economic development is famous: "Add
successively as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a
railway thereby" (Schumpeter 1934, p. 64). So far, the literature
highlights five long waves: The beginning industrialization around the
year 1800 represented the first long wave and was fueled by the steam
engine and by cotton processing. Then, starting around the year 1850,
the widespread availability of steel and the diffusion of railways
constituted a second long wave. Again, in the early twentieth century,
this Kondratieff cycle was replaced by electricity and chemicals. In the
postwar period, the third long wave gained momentum by mass production
and the automobile as well as the petrochemical industries. Since then,
manufacturing activities built on oil as a second fossil fuel apart from
coal. From the 1980s, one refers to the fifth long wave, which is
reflected in the fast and ubiquitous diffusion and application of
information and communication technology. [**Now**, at the beginning of
the twenty-first century, **[another paradigmatic change is in the
air]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [being characterized]{.underline}, however,
[by]{.underline} one major difference to previous situations of radical
change: whereas previous cycles were driven by technological bottlenecks
and their overcoming, in the twenty-first century, we face the vital
question of how to restore environmental sustainability of economic
activities. [The **knowledge-based bioeconomy**]{.underline} plays a key
role in this transformation process which, of course, like previous
radical changes, still is confronted by fundamental uncertainty (Knight
1921).

The literature provides many alternative terms for the massive change,
shaking global production systems: Freeman (1991) and Dosi (1982) call
them techno-economic paradigm changes; Sahal (1985) uses cartographic
analogies and refers to technological guideposts that are pointing to
technological avenues. All authors highlight the confrontation with
profound changes economic systems are faced with over longer periods of
time, which question all established production approaches. Not a single
technology is responsible for this phenomenon but several complementary
developments that include, apart from a package of mutually dependent
technologies (e.g., combustion engine, petrochemistry, assembly line
production), numerous infrastructural developments (e.g., road
structure, filling station network), behavioral changes (e.g., suburbs
and commuter flow, shopping malls outside the city centers), as well as
institutional changes (e.g., spatial planning and commuter allowance,
etc.). The old paradigm will not be replaced by the new one until all
these elements interact.

The neo-Schumpeterian approach provides us with crucial hints on the
process of the forthcoming change. For this purpose, we discuss in the
following section how [innovations are **supported by the discovery**
and **successful diffusion** of new knowledge]{.underline}.
Knowledge-based economies organize innovation systems composed of
different actors which establish a creative environment for mutual
learning and knowledge creation. [[**No innovation would have ever been
established if it had not attracted consumers' interest** and if it had
not been **leveraged by their purchasing power**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
We will focus on these questions in Sect. 11.3. Knowledge-based
societies consider new concepts in the sense of [responsible
innovation]{.underline} that [are decisive in bringing an entire economy
on a new sustainable path-shaping growth and development]{.underline}.
Section 11.4 deals with the massive economic impacts originating from
these technological and knowledge-driven changes. It requires, besides
technological change, also institutional change in a coevolutionary
fashion, if new sustainable technologies are to achieve the aspired
transformation of the economic system.

11.2 Innovation Systems and Knowledge Neo-Schumpeterian scholars (e.g.,
Dosi et al. 1988; Lundvall 1992, 1998; Nelson 1993) strongly emphasize
the systemic character of innovation processes. So-called innovation
systems are composed of different actors (companies, research
institutions, political actors, consumers, etc.) and linkages between
these actors (flows of goods, R&D cooperation, knowledge transfer
relationships, user-producer relationships, etc.). These linkages are
required to ensure mutual learning and common knowledge development to
solve complex innovation challenges. Such systems are characterized by
their dynamic and coevolutionary nature and are thus enormously complex,
as both actors and their knowledge and linkages and interactions between
actors may change over time. Dosi (1982) takes this systemic conception
as a starting point in defining technological paradigms as "\[...\] set
of procedures, or a definition of the 'relevant' problems and of the
specific knowledge related to their solution." Transferred to the
knowledge-based bioeconomy, the core idea is substitution, i.e.,
replacing carbon-based materials and energy with bio-based materials and
energy. This can only be achieved by applying a variety of technological
processes in the entire breadth and depth of the value-added chain. In
this process the exploration of economic complementarities in terms of
cross-fertilization of different knowledge fields matters. For example,
to a large extent, digitalization allows for an extension of value
chains by increasing the added value in new sustainable production
sectors in a CO2-neutral way (e.g., by electric mobility based on
renewables, by establishing so-called smart grids, etc.). The concept of
technological paradigms also illustrates that a paradigm shift is not
possible at any time. A window of opportunity will only occasionally be
opened and allow for a paradigm shift when several interconnected
technologies are established and the creation of conducive demand side
and institutional conditions happens simultaneously. This, of course,
also holds for the emergence of a new bioeconomic innovation system and
requires a sound balance of the various actors and their activities. For
this reason, we introduce the notion of a dedicated innovation system.

The theory of industrial life cycles, which emphasizes the strong
dynamics in the emergence and decline of industries, gives a first hint
on the meaning of the development of a dedicated innovation system
supporting the transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.
Typically, industrial development is divided into four stages: (1) a
development phase (new knowledge creates prerequisites for innovation),
(2) an entrepreneurial and growth phase (many market entries of smaller
innovative firms), (3) a saturation and consolidation phase (formation
of industrial standards, mergers, and acquisitions as well as market
exits), and (4) a downturn phase (oligopolistic competition in only less
innovative industries) (e.g., Audretsch and Feldman 1996). Although the
bioeconomy does not represent a well-defined industrial sector,
understanding the theory of industrial life cycles is of crucial
importance to govern the transformation process towards the
knowledge-based bioeconomy. Without doubt, the bioeconomy has to be
characterized as cross sectional. On the one hand, [**[several new
sectors will emerge]{.mark}**, e.g., in the fields of **bioplastic**,
**waste management**, or **biorefineries**]{.underline}. On the other
hand, [**[already existing sectors]{.mark}** in the fields of **vehicle
construction**, **battery technology**, **pharmaceuticals**, etc. [will
**gain new momentum**]{.mark} by the arrival of bioeconomic
approaches]{.underline}. Therefore, we argue that new sectors will
emerge by establishing bioeconomic technologies and development dynamics
of some already existing industries will receive new impetus at the same
time. [[**Adjustments** of]{.mark} old and development of new
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., in Germany the Renewable
Energy Act, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Law, etc.),
[adjustments of **[consumer habits]{.mark}**, and the emergence of **new
educational opportunities**]{.underline} in terms of coevolution [[will
**accompany these**]{.mark} **processes** and establish]{.underline} the
institutional, the industrial, and the consumer pillars of [a
**dedicated innovation system**]{.underline}.

The patterns and nature of new businesses in the bioeconomy are thus
strongly influenced by national institutions and organizations (Casper
et al. 1999; Whitley 1999). Institutions are defined as "a set of rules,
formal or informal, that actors generally follow, whether for normative,
cognitive, or material reasons." "Organizations are durable entities
with formally recognized members, whose rules also contribute to the
institutions of the political economy" (North 1990; Hall and Soskice
2001). In this interplay between organizations and institutions, the
knowledge base of an economy is created by the education and research
system and represents one of the most important prerequisites for the
transformation towards a bioeconomic production system (Geels 2002).
This automatically relates to a high level of uncertainty in particular
concerning the required future competences. In this complex process,
numerous individual knowledge fields are potentially relevant for the
transformation and are already identified, e.g., synthetic chemistry,
process engineering, genetic engineering, food technology, or
informatics. It is decisive to understand the dynamics of these
knowledge fields and the possibilities of their recombination with other
knowledge fields and adequate actors in order to create an innovation
system. In many cases, linkages of different knowledge fields
(cross-fertilization) are responsible for the emergence of extensive
technological opportunities: for instance, a complete new industry,
bioinformatics, has been initiated by the fusion of two so far unrelated
knowledge fields, database technology and molecular biology. Because
linking different knowledge fields is highly uncertain, private actors
might not start and governmental innovation policies matter. Knowledge
about future potentials, therefore, is essential for supporting research
and innovation policies: the analysis of knowledge and network dynamics
allows for the identification of development trajectories showing
sectors requiring public attention and support concerning research and
development in order to close existing knowledge gaps and build bridges
between various knowledge domains (Burt 2004; Zaheer and Bell 2005).
11.3 Innovation in Knowledge-Based Societies It has already been
mentioned that also consumer knowledge plays an important role for the
development and establishment of sustainable consumption patterns in a
knowledge-based bioeconomy (Geels 2002). Therefore, the analysis of the
transformation process has to include the interaction of technological
development, demand, and acceptance of innovative solutions as well as
sociological variables. The latter include education, age, income, and
gender. All are important explanatory factors determining attention and
readiness to deal with bioeconomic issues. A bioeconomic innovation will
only be successful when consumers accept it. The direction of the
transformation process is, comparable to the importance of the policy
realm, determined by consumers, i.e., an important question has to
address consumers' openness to the bioeconomy and its products. Finally,
(real and virtual) social networks matter for the establishment of new
consumption patterns. They can contribute significantly to a diffusion
of consumers' behavioral patterns and values (Robertson et al. 1996;
Valente 1996; Nyblom et al. 2003; Deffuant et al. 2005). Recent studies
show that attitudes are substantial for the development of social
relationships and that, in turn, social relationships considerably
influence behavior and attitudes. In the field of renewable energies,
for example, the initiative of municipal utilities' customers has led in
many cases to a "green" orientation of regional power supply. In some
cases, citizens' networks finally transformed to investment companies
that are engaged in wind farms. Critical issues are to be dealt with in
democratic processes in order to be widely accepted. Not everything that
is technically possible is also socially desirable. In the field of the
bioeconomy, this may, for instance, include the use of genetically
modified organisms in agriculture. In fact, these organisms promise
efficiency advantages with regard to the consumption of land and water,
etc., but their long-term health and environmental risks cannot be
completely (as with any new technology) anticipated. Accordingly,
technological developments require consumers' acceptance and thus depend
on the level of education in an economy. This raises the question of a
society's openness towards innovations that are fundamentally associated
with uncertainty. The concept of responsible innovation summarizes the
future-oriented organization of development and is currently discussed
with a high priority by European policy makers and institutions. A
comprehensive working definition has been developed by Von Schomberg
(2011). He describes responsible innovation as "a transparent,
interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become
mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical)
acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the
innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a
proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our
society)." This means that innovations are not exclusively evaluated by
their economic efficiency, but different aspects (e.g., consumer
protection or ecological aspects; see Schlaile et al. 2017) also matter
and are to be evaluated. Discussions on biofuels ("fuel vs. food") show
that both a pure economic and a one-dimensional ethical perspective are
not sufficient. The quality of these discussions depends on the
discussants' mutual understanding which in turn depends on the
participants' level of knowledge. Modern plant breeding and production
of seeds are bioeconomy fields of innovation in which issues of
responsibility are discussed frequently and controversially. German
consumers are skeptical about interference with the genome of food
crops, but individual points of criticism remain unclear. New breeding
techniques introduced, e.g., genome editing, enable scientists to
selectively modify DNA strands of crop plants. These techniques are
considered innovative as they may allow breeding of potentially
efficient plants in fast and cheap ways. Species developed this way
hardly differ from those of conventional breeding. The Central Advisory
Committee for Biological Safety does not classify these techniques as
genetic engineering, especially because no new combinations of genetic
material are made. As the Genetic Engineering Act does not explicitly
address these techniques, legal clarification is still necessary as to
whether these techniques are classified as genetic engineering at all.
Dissemination potential and acceptance are influenced by this result.
Here again, the necessity to include education and information policies
becomes evident to support the transformation towards a knowledge-based
bioeconomy. The concept of social innovation (e.g., Hanusch and Pyka
2013) emphasizes the importance of active citizenship in innovation.
Thus, according to the understanding of the European Commission, this
term includes innovations that are social, both in relation to their
objective and their instruments. In particular, this includes
innovations referring to the development and the application of new
ideas (for products, services, and models), covering at the same time
social demand and creating new social relationships or collaborations.
The whole society should benefit and contribute to generate new impetus
for improvement. Social innovations can make a major contribution to
rural development and promote economic resilience in these regions by
strengthening cooperative behavior. Rural cooperatives (e.g., regional
producer and marketing associations, winegrowers' cooperatives, tourism
associations, etc.) can help to develop regional competitiveness
considering ecological and social aspects. As a consequence, within the
framework of a bioeconomy, rural regions that are notably affected by
the already imminent demographic change and subsequent depopulation
receive new opportunities for economic development. 11.4 The Economics
of Change

The sections above illustrate that a transformation of the prevailing
economic system towards a bioeconomy is an extremely complex process.
Various different actors participating in different roles are
contributing different pieces of knowledge. In this process,
[**innovative adjustments** in already existing industries as well as
the **emergence of new** and the **disappearance of mature industries**
can be **observed simultaneously**]{.underline}. In addition to the
substitutive relations of new bio-based industries to traditional
oil-based industries, [[there are **numerous**]{.mark} **essential
complementary [relations giving further momentum]{.mark}** for the
transformation process]{.underline}. First and foremost, [there are the
possibilities and application fields of **digitalization**.
[Digitalization allows to **replace many**]{.mark} **oil-based
products** and **[energy-intensive services]{.mark}** simply by bits and
bytes]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [digitalization offers a **wide
range of opportunities** by coordinating decentralized and very
detailed]{.underline} bioeconomic [technologies and processes such as
energy production and distribution. This **affects the composition of
individual sectors**]{.underline} where a coexistence of large
diversified companies and small high-specialized technology companies is
a likely solution. Finally, [digitalization also offers consumer
platforms to efficiently organize "**sharing economy**"
approaches]{.underline}. Finally, successful knowledge generation and
diffusion of relevant bioeconomic knowledge depends on dynamic
innovation networks (Pyka 2002) in which different actors jointly share
and create new knowledge. The consumers, represented, for example, by
consumer associations or politics, will play a key role in these
innovation networks and will help to establish networks in early stages
of technology development.

In a knowledge-based bioeconomy, [[**investment** and]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}** still [represent a **crucial
element**]{.mark}]{.underline} for employment, international
competitiveness, and income generation. The bioeconomy can make
important contributions to accelerate investments by [**[providing new
investment opportunities]{.mark}** generated by **fundamental
innovations** [and]{.mark} thereby [bringing]{.mark} currently
[available]{.mark} large quantities of [liquidity to a productive
use]{.mark}]{.underline}. This, in turn, **[[accelerates the]{.mark}
technological [paradigm shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Pérez 2010).

[The time path of the transformation process]{.underline} represents
another critical component and [has been explored only
partially]{.underline} so far. [On the one hand, it is **high time to
reduce carbon-based production methods**. On the other hand, there will
be **frictions in the transformation process being
caused**]{.underline}, for example, by a lack of specialists and
required competences. In this context, [the]{.underline} so-called
[sailing ship effects]{.underline} (Howells 2002), frequently observed
with radical innovations, [could be **made of good use**]{.underline}.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, when the existence of the
established sailing ship technology was threatened by the arrival of new
steam ships, shipbuilders---not having changed their technologies for
many decades, if not centuries---began to innovate again. [Due to the
**threat of innovative technologies**, [adjustment reactions]{.mark} in
predecessor technologies can be observed with the aim to **prevent the
ancient technologies to be quickly replaced**. Such adjustment reactions
are, [for example, **fuel-efficient**]{.mark} **combustion
[engines]{.mark}** and **hybrid technologies**]{.underline} as a
reaction to the emergence of electric vehicles. [These adjustments [are
**advantageous** since they pursue the **same environmental
objectives**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., inner-city fine dust and noise
reduction, etc.) [[and]{.mark} thus **[provide more time to develop new
tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}. Accordingly, the transformation
process will for longer periods of time feature a coexistence of
traditional and bio-based industries. Furthermore, [it will be important
to concurrently **steer the relevant innovation processes** in
traditional technologies]{.underline}. This coexistence further
increases complexity. At the same time, innovation policy is given room
for maneuver and yet insufficiently developed technologies are prevented
from being introduced prematurely which might cause promising approaches
to fail.

### Growth Solves Environment

#### Only continuing growth and [clean innovation]{.underline} can avert extinction

**Bailey, 18**---science correspondent for Reason magazine (Ronald, "Is
Degrowth the Only Way to Save the World?,"
<https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/16/is-degrowth-the-only-way-to-save-the-wor>,
dml)

[Unless]{.underline} us folks in [rich countries drastically
reduce]{.underline} our material [living standards]{.underline} and
distribute most of what we have to people living in poor countries,
[**[the world will come to an end]{.mark}**. Or at least
[that\'s]{.mark} [the]{.mark} stark [conclusion of]{.mark}]{.underline}
a study published earlier this month in the journal Nature
Sustainability. The researchers who wrote it, led by the Leeds
University ecological economist Dan O\'Neill, think the way to prevent
the apocalypse is \"**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

Vice, pestilence, war, and \"gigantic inevitable famine\" were the
planetary boundaries set on human population by the 18th-century
economist Robert Thomas Malthus. The new study gussies up old-fashioned
Malthusianism by devising a set of seven biophysical indicators of
national environmental pressure, which they then link to 11 indicators
of social outcomes. The aim of the exercise is to concoct a \"safe and
just space\" for humanity. Using data from 2011, the researchers
calculate that the annual per capita boundaries for the world\'s 7
billion people consist of the emission of 1.6 tons of carbon dioxide per
year and the annual consumption of 0.9 kilograms of phosphorus, 8.9
kilograms of nitrogen, 574 cubic meters of water, 2.6 tons of biomass
(crops and wood), plus the ecological services of 1.7 hectares of land
and 7.2 tons of material per person. On the social side, meanwhile, the
researchers say that life satisfaction in each country should exceed 6.5
on the 10-point Cantril scale, that healthy life expectancy should
average at least 65 years, and that nutrition should be over 2,700
calories per day. At least 95 percent of each country\'s citizens must
have access to good sanitation, earn more than \$1.90 per day, and pass
through secondary school. Ninety percent of citizens must have friends
and family they can depend on. The threshold for democratic quality must
exceed 0.8 on an index scale stretching from -1 to +1, while the
threshold for equality is set at no higher than 70 on a Gini Index where
0 represents perfect equality and 100 implies perfect inequality. They
set the threshold for percent of labor force employed at 94 percent. So
how does the U.S. do with regard to their biophysical boundaries and
social outcomes measures? We Americans transgress all seven of the
biophysical boundaries. Carbon dioxide emissions stand at 21.2 tons per
person; we each use an average of 7 kilograms of phosphorus, 59.1
kilograms of nitrogen, 611 cubic meters of water, and 3.7 tons of
biomass; we rely on the ecological services of 6.8 hectares of land and
27.2 tons of material. Although the researchers urge us to move \"beyond
the pursuit of GDP growth to embrace new measures of progress,\" it is
worth noting that U.S. GDP is \$59,609 per capita. On the other hand,
those transgressions have provided a pretty good life for Americans. For
example, life satisfaction is 7.1; healthy life expectancy is 69.7
years; and democratic quality stands at 0.8 points. The only two social
indicators we just missed on were employment (91 percent) and secondary
education (94.7 percent). On the other hand, our hemisphere is home to
one paragon of sustainability---Haiti. Haitians breach none of the
researchers\' biophysical boundaries. But the Caribbean country performs
abysmally on all 11 social indicators. Life satisfaction scores at 4.8;
healthy life expectancy is 52.3 years; and Haitians average 2,105
calories per day. The country tallies -0.9 on the democratic quality
index. Haiti\'s GDP is \$719 per capita. Other near-sustainability
champions include Malawi, Nepal, Myanmar, and Nicaragua. All of them
score dismally on the social indicators, and their GDPs per capita are
\$322, \$799, \$1,375, and \$2,208, respectively. The country that
currently comes closest to the researchers\' ideal of remaining within
its biophysical boundaries while sufficient social indicators
is\...Vietnam. For the record, Vietnam\'s per capita GDP is \$2,306.
\"Countries with higher levels of life satisfaction and healthy life
expectancy also tend to transgress more biophysical boundaries,\" the
researchers note. A better way to put this relationship is that more
wealth and technology tend to make people happier, healthier, and freer.

O\'Neill and his unhappy team fail drastically to understand how [human
[ingenuity]{.mark} unleashed [in markets is]{.mark} **already well [on
the way]{.mark}** [toward making]{.mark}]{.underline} their [supposed
planetary [boundaries **irrelevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Take
**carbon dioxide emissions**]{.underline}: Supporters of
**[[renewable]{.mark} energy technologies]{.underline}** say that their
[[costs are]{.mark} **already** [or **will**]{.mark} **soon [be
lower]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} those of [fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Boosters of **[advanced [nuclear]{.mark}
reactors]{.underline}** similarly argue that they [[can supply
**all**]{.mark} **of [the]{.mark} carbon-free [energy the world will
need]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There\'s a good chance that [fleets of
**[battery-powered]{.mark} self-driving [vehicles]{.mark}**
[will]{.mark} largely [replace]{.mark} private cars and mass
[transit]{.mark}]{.underline} later in this century.

[Are we about to run out of **phosphorous** to fertilize our crops?
[Peak phosphorus is **not at hand**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) reports that [at current rates of mining, the
world\'s [known reserves will last **266 years**]{.mark}. The estimated
[total resources]{.mark} of phosphate rock [would last **over
1,140**]{.mark} **years**]{.underline}. \"There are no imminent
shortages of phosphate rock,\" notes the USGS. With respect to the
deleterious effects that using phosphorus to fertilize crops might have
outside of farm fields, [[researchers]{.mark} are working on ways to
[endow crops]{.mark} with traits that enable them [to **use less while
maintaining yields**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

O\'Neill and his colleagues are also concerned that farmers are using
too much [nitrogen fertilizer]{.underline}, which runs off fields into
the natural environment and contributes to deoxygenated dead zones in
the oceans, among other ill effects. This [is a problem, but one that
plant breeders are **already working to solve**]{.underline}. For
example, [researchers]{.underline} at Arcadia Biosciences [have used
[biotech]{.mark}nology to [create **nitrogen-efficient**]{.mark}
**varieties** of [staples]{.mark} like rice and wheat [that]{.mark}
enable farmers to [**increase yields** while]{.mark} **significantly
[reducing]{.mark} fertilizer [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
other researchers are moving on projects to engineer the nitrogen
fixation trait from legumes into cereal crops. In other words, [the
[crops]{.mark} would **[make]{.mark} their own [fertilizer from
air]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Water?]{.mark} Most water is devoted to the irrigation of crops; the
ongoing development of [**drought-resistant** and **saline-tolerant
crops** will help]{.mark} with that. Hectares per capita? [Humanity
has]{.mark} probably **[already reached peak farmland]{.mark}**, and
**[nearly 400 million hectares will be restored]{.mark} to nature** by
2060]{.underline}---an area almost double the size of the United States
east of the Mississippi River. In fact, [it is entirely possible that
**most [animal farming will be replaced]{.mark}** by resource-sparing
lab-grown steaks, chops, and milk. Such developments in food production
**undermine**]{.underline} the researchers\' [**worries about
overconsumption of biomass**.]{.underline}

[And humanity\'s material footprint is **likely to get smaller too** as
trends toward **further dematerialization** take hold. The price system
is a **superb mechanism** for encouraging innovators to find ways to
wring ever more value out less and less stuff]{.underline}. Rockefeller
University researcher Jesse Ausubel has shown that [this process of
absolute dematerialization has **already taken off** for many
commodities.]{.underline}

After cranking their way through their models of doom, O\'Neill and his
[colleagues]{.underline} lugubriously [conclude]{.underline}: \"If all
people are to lead a good life within planetary boundaries, then the
level of [resource use]{.underline} associated with meeting basic needs
[must be dramatically reduced.\" They are right, but they are **entirely
backward** with regard to how to achieve those goals]{.underline}.
[**Economic growth** provides the **wealth** and **technologies needed**
to lift people from poverty while **simultaneously lightening
humanity\'s footprint** on the natural world. [**Rather than degrowth**,
the **planet**]{.mark}---and especially its poor people---[need **more**
and **faster**]{.mark} **economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### No Transition

#### No chance of a transition\-\--degrowth has no political backing and people won't accept limitations on their lifestyles

Hubert **Buch-Hansen 18**, Department of Business and Politics,
Copenhagen Business School, "The Prerequisites for a Degrowth Paradigm
Shift: Insights from Critical Political Economy," *Ecological
Economics*, Volume 146, April 2018, pp. 157-163

**[Political projects do not become hegemonic just because they embody
good ideas]{.underline}**. For a project to become hegemonic, (organic)
intellectuals first need to develop the project and a constellation of
social forces with sufficient power and resources to implement it then
needs to find it appealing and struggle for it. In this context, it is
worth noting that [degrowth]{.underline}, as a social movement, [has
been gaining momentum for some time]{.underline}, not least in Southern
Europe. Countless grassroots\' initiatives (e.g., D\'Alisa et al., 2013)
are the most visible manifestations that degrowth is on the rise.
Intellectuals -- including founders of ecological economics such as
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, and more recently degrowth
scholars such as Serge Latouche and Giorgos Kallis -- have played a
major role in developing and disseminating the ideas underpinning the
project. A growing interest in degrowth in academia, as well as
well-attended biennial international degrowth conferences, also indicate
that an increasing number of people embrace such ideas.

Still, [the [degrowth]{.mark} project [is **nowhere near**]{.mark}
**enjoying [the]{.mark} degree and type of [support it needs]{.mark}**
if its policies are to be implemented through democratic processes. The
number of]{.underline} political [parties]{.underline}, labour [unions,
business associations and international organisations that have so far
embraced degrowth is **modest to say the least**. Economic and political
[elites]{.mark}, **including social democratic parties and most of the
trade union movement**, [are **united** in]{.mark} the [belief]{.mark}
that]{.underline} economic [[growth is]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary
and [[desirable]{.underline}]{.mark}. This consensus finds support in
the prevailing type of economic theory and underpins the main contenders
in the neoliberal project, such as centre-left and nationalist projects.
In spite of the world\'s multidimensional crisis, a pro-growth discourse
in other words continues to be hegemonic: it is widely considered a
matter of common sense that continued economic growth is required.

It is also noteworthy that [economic and political elites]{.underline},
to a large extent, continue to [support the neoliberal project, [even in
the face of]{.mark} its evident [shortcomings]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, the 2008 financial crisis did not result in the weakening of
transnational financial capital that could have paved the way for a
paradigm shift. Instead of coming to an end, [neoliberal capitalism
has]{.underline} arguably [entered a more authoritarian
phase]{.underline} (Bruff, 2014). The main reason the power of the
pre-crisis coalition remains intact is that governments stepped in and
saved the dominant fraction by means of massive bailouts. [It is a
**foregone conclusion**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} this fraction
and [the wider coalition behind the neoliberal paradigm]{.underline}
(transnational industrial capital, the middle classes and segments of
organized labour) [will consider the degrowth paradigm unattractive and
that such [social forces will **vehemently oppose**]{.mark} **the
[implementation]{.mark} of degrowth policies**]{.underline} (see also
Rees, 2014: 97).

While degrowth advocates envision a future in which market forces play a
less prominent role than they do today, degrowth is not an anti-market
project. As such, it can attract support from certain types of market
actors. In particular, it is worth noting that social enterprises, such
as cooperatives (Restakis, 2010), play a major role in the degrowth
vision. Such enterprises are defined by being 'organisations involved at
least to some extent in the market, with a clear social, cultural and/or
environmental purpose, rooted in and serving primarily the local
community and ideally having a local and/or democratic ownership
structure' (Johanisova et al., 2013: 11). Social enterprises currently
exist at the margins of a system, in which the dominant type of business
entity is profit-oriented, shareholder-owned corporations. [The [further
dissemination]{.mark} of social enterprises]{.underline}, which is
[**crucial to the transitions to degrowth societies**,
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in many cases -- [**[blocked]{.mark} or
delayed** [as]{.mark} a [result of]{.mark} the centrifugal forces of
[global competition]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wigger and Buch-Hansen, 2013).
Overall, social enterprises thus (still) constitute a social force with
modest power.

Ougaard (2016: 467) notes that one of the major dividing lines in the
contemporary transnational capitalist class is between capitalists who
have a material interest in the carbon-based economy and capitalists who
have a material interest in decarbonisation. The latter group, for
instance, includes manufacturers of equipment for the production of
renewable energy (ibid.: 467). As mentioned above, degrowth advocates
have singled out renewable energy as one of the sectors that needs to
grow in the future. As such, it seems likely that the owners of national
and transnational companies operating in this sector would be more
positively inclined towards the degrowth project than would capitalists
with a stake in the carbon-based economy. Still, the prospect of the
"green sector" emerging as a driving force behind degrowth currently
appears meagre. Being under the control of transnational capital
(Harris, 2010), such companies generally embrace the "green growth"
discourse, which 'is deeply embedded in neoliberal capitalism' and
indeed serves to adjust this form of capitalism 'to crises arising from
contradictions within itself' (Wanner, 2015: 23).

In addition to support from the social forces engendered by the
production process, a [political project 'also needs the political
ability to mobilize majorities in **parliamentary democracies**, and a
sufficient measure of at least passive consent']{.underline} (van
Apeldoorn and Overbeek, 2012: 5--6) if it is to become hegemonic. As
mentioned, **[degrowth enjoys little support in
parliaments]{.underline}**, and certainly the pro-growth discourse is
hegemonic among parties in government.5 With capital accumulation being
the most important driving force in capitalist societies, political
decision-makers are generally eager to create conditions conducive to
production and the accumulation of capital (Lindblom, 1977: 172).
[Capitalist states and international organisations are thus
"**programmed" to facilitate capital accumulation**]{.underline}, and do
as such constitute a strategically selective terrain that works to the
disadvantage of the degrowth project.

The main [[advocates of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark} project [[are grassroots, small]{.mark}
fractions of left-wing parties and labour unions as well as
[academics]{.mark}]{.underline} and other citizens who are concerned
about social injustice and the environmentally unsustainable nature of
societies in the rich parts of the world. The project is thus
ideationally driven in the sense that support for it is not so much
rooted in the material circumstances or short-term self-interests of
specific groups or classes as it is rooted in the conviction that
degrowth is necessary if current and future generations across the globe
are to be able to lead a good life. While there is no shortage of
enthusiasts and creative ideas in the [degrowth]{.underline} movement,
it [has **only modest resources** compared to other political
projects.]{.underline} To put it bluntly, [the advocates of degrowth
**do not possess instruments** that enable them to force political
decision-makers to listen to]{.underline} -- **[let alone comply
with]{.underline}** -- t[heir views.]{.underline} As such, they are in a
weaker position than the labour union movement was in its heyday, and
they are in a far weaker position than the owners and managers of large
corporations are today (on the structural power of transnational
corporations, see Gill and Law, 1989).

6\. Consent

It is also safe to say that [degrowth enjoys no "passive consent" from
the majority of the population]{.underline}. For the time being,
**[degrowth [remains unknown]{.mark} to most people]{.underline}**. Yet,
if it were to become generally known, [most people would probably not
find the vision of a smaller economic system appealing]{.underline}.
This is not just a matter of **[degrowth]{.underline}** being 'a missile
word that backfires' because it **[[triggers negative feelings in people
when they]{.mark} first [hear it]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Drews and
Antal, 2016). It is also a matter of the actual content of the degrowth
project.

Two issues in particular should be mentioned in this context. First, for
many, the anti-capitalist sentiments embodied in the degrowth project
will inevitably be a difficult pill to swallow. Today, [the vast
majority of people find it almost impossible to conceive of a world
without capitalism.]{.underline} There is a 'widespread sense that not
only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but
also that it is now impossible to even imagine a coherent alternative to
it' (Fisher, 2009: 2). As Jameson (2003) famously observed, it is, in a
sense, easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the
end of capitalism. However, not only is [degrowth]{.underline} -- like
other anti-capitalist projects -- up against the challenge that most
people consider capitalism the only system that can function; it is also
up against the additional challenge that it [speaks against economic
growth in a world where the desirability of growth is considered common
sense.]{.underline}

Second, [[degrowth is incompatible with]{.mark} the [lifestyles]{.mark}
to which [many]{.mark} of us who live in rich countries [have become
accustomed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economic growth in the Western world
is, to no small extent, premised on the existence of consumer societies
and an associated consumer culture most of us find it difficult to
completely escape. In this culture, [[social status, happiness,
well-being]{.mark} and identity [are]{.mark} **[linked to
consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009). Indeed, it is widely
considered a natural right to lead an environmentally unsustainable
lifestyle -- a lifestyle that includes car ownership, air travel,
spacious accommodations, fashionable clothing, an omnivorous diet and
all sorts of electronic gadgets. [This Western norm of consumption has
increasingly been exported to other parts of the world]{.underline}, the
result being that never before have so many people taken part in
consumption patterns that used to be reserved for elites (Koch, 2012).
If degrowth were to be institutionalised, many citizens in the rich
countries would have to adapt to a materially lower standard of living.
That is, while the basic needs of the global population can be met in a
non-growing economy, not all wants and preferences can be fulfilled
(Koch et al., 2017). Undoubtedly, [many people]{.underline} in the rich
countries [would experience]{.underline} various [limitations on their
consumption opportunities as a **violent encroachment on their personal
freedom**]{.underline}. Indeed, whereas many recognize that contemporary
consumer societies are environmentally unsustainable, fewer are prepared
to actually change their own lifestyles to reverse/address this.

At present, then, the degrowth project is in its "deconstructive phase",
i.e., the phase in which its advocates are able to present a powerful
critique of the prevailing neoliberal project and point to alternative
solutions to crisis. At this stage, [**not enough support has been
mobilised** behind]{.underline} the [degrowth project for it to be
elevated to the phases of "construction" and
"consolidation]{.underline}". [**It is conceivable** that at some point,
enough people will become sufficiently discontent]{.underline} with the
existing economic system and push for something radically different.
Reasons for doing so could be the failure of the system to satisfy human
needs and/or its inability to resolve the multidimensional crisis
confronting humanity. Yet, **[various material and ideational
path-dependencies currently stand in the way of such a
development]{.underline}**, particularly in countries with large
middle-classes. **[Even if it were to happen]{.underline}** [that the
majority wanted a break with the current system, it is far from given
that]{.underline} a system based on the ideas of [degrowth is what they
would demand]{.underline}.

### Decline Bad

#### Decline causes extinction

William **Pesek 18**, former columnist for Barron's and Bloomberg,
quoting former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Eurasia Group
President Ian Bremmer, 1/12/18, "Why a 2018 crisis would be particularly
devastating,"
http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/iLkHAL2cCCxfOqYvRzFAsL/Why-a-2018-crisis-would-be-particularly-devastating.html

Twenty years ago, Lawrence Summers came up with a particularly graphic
analogy for market crises: airplane crashes.

Jets, the former US treasury secretary explained, make travel faster,
more efficient and safer, although the odd accident is far more stunning
and deadly than one that befalls other forms of transport. "In the same
way," Summers said, "modern global financial markets carry with them
enormous potential for benefit, even if some of the accidents are that
much more spectacular."

This comparison leaps to mind as Summers sounds the alarm about 2018.
[Summers's core policy belief is this: even when the periphery of [the
global economy]{.mark}]{.underline} (emerging markets) [plunges, the
centre]{.underline} (developed ones) [is solid enough to hold capitalism
together. Increasingly]{.underline}, Summers believes **[that centre
[might crack in]{.mark} the event of [new
turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[even within the 12 months
ahead]{.underline}.

[Stock [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Summers points out in recent
speeches and op-eds, [[are]{.mark} going
[gangbusters]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's [[despite the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} being in the hands of a leader threatening trade
wars, redistributing wealth to the top 1%, **[[taunting nuclear states
via Twitter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, spouting untruths, attacking the
media, [flouting international laws, [trampling]{.mark} on [democratic
values]{.mark}]{.underline} and cozying up to autocrats Washington used
to abhor.

[[China, Russia, Turkey]{.mark} and [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline},
Summers argues, [[are "more authoritarian]{.mark}, more nationalist and
[more truculent on the world stage]{.mark} than they were a year ago."
[North Korea is growing]{.mark} more [belligerent]{.mark}]{.underline},
more erratic [and more nuclear]{.underline} year after year.
[Europe]{.underline}, meanwhile, remains traumatized by Britain's exit
from the European Union (EU) and [faces myriad populist and far-right
insurgencies]{.underline}.

All this begs the question: why, oh why, are equity markets surging as
if investors haven't a care? Why are bond yields so impossibly low from
Washington to Tokyo as leaders borrow with abandon? Perhaps Bitcoin's
bewildering bull run is more a symptom of the extent to which markets
have lost all sense of reality than an anomaly.

Trouble is, [the global economy's surface looks infinitely better than
the foundations]{.underline} beneath it. "Yes, [[markets are
soaring]{.mark} and the economy isn't bad, [but]{.mark} citizens are
divided," says]{.underline} Ian [Bremmer, president of Eurasia
Group]{.underline}. "Governments aren't doing much governing. And **[the
[global order is unraveling]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

[[What happens if]{.mark} there is some kind of reckoning?]{.underline}
Say **[[if Wall Street hit a 2008-like wall]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
China's debt meltdown arrived or Washington started a trade war. A major
terrorist attack, conflict on the Korean peninsula, confrontation in the
South China Sea or troubles in Iran or Pakistan could slam markets.

At the same moment, ["the scale of the world's political challenges is
daunting]{.underline}", Bremmer says. "[Liberal democracies have less
legitimacy than at any time since World War II]{.underline}, and most of
their structural problems don't appear fixable. [[Today's]{.mark}
strongest [leaders show little interest in]{.mark}]{.underline} civil
society or [[common values]{.underline}]{.mark}." Looking at the past
two decades, [if his team "had to pick one year for a big unexpected
crisis]{.underline}---the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial
meltdown---**[it feels like 2018]{.underline}**," Bremmer says.

[Summers worries geopolitics and economics will collide]{.underline}.
"Financial markets are widely cited, including by US President Donald
Trump, as providing comfort in the current moment," he says. "But [**a
[relapse into financial crisis would]{.mark} likely [have catastrophic
political consequences]{.mark}**, sweeping into power even more toxic
populist nationalists]{.underline}."

My objective here isn't to give readers sleepless nights, but to call
out the gaping disconnect between jubilant markets and the chaos that
may lie ahead.

[Asia learned a great deal from its 1997-98 meltdown]{.underline}. Banks
were strengthened, currencies became more flexible, central banks
amassed ample currency reserves and governments increased transparency.
After that 2013 "taper tantrum," India, for example, worked to stabilize
the rupee, tame inflation and address bad loans in the banking system.
[[The West learned]{.mark} far [less from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[20[08]{.mark}]{.underline} Lehman Brothers crash, throwing money at the
problem, but demurring on painful reforms. **[[Banks are
re-leveraging]{.mark} as we speak]{.underline}**.

[[Market meltdowns]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[happen]{.mark}
**sooner and [faster than punters expect]{.mark}**[. In]{.mark} 20[08,
the US responded by cutting]{.mark} short-term [rates]{.mark} 500 basis
points]{.underline} (one basis point is 0.01 percentage point), while
peers in Europe and Japan followed suit. [**[Such a response isn't
available in 2018]{.mark}**. Nor is aggressive fiscal
loosening]{.underline}. The Trump White House already engineered a \$1.5
trillion tax cut the economy didn't need.

[That]{.underline}, Summers says, [means [**the next recession will be
"protracted and deep**, with **severe global consequences**]{.mark}." In
2009]{.underline}, after Wall Street cracked, then-US President Barack
[[Obama cobbled together]{.mark} a global [response with
**G**]{.mark}]{.underline}roup of [**[20]{.mark}** nations. [Trump has
**gone the other way**]{.mark}, alienating]{.underline} most of the
[allies Obama worked with to restore global calm]{.underline}.

"I shudder to think what [a [serious recession will
mean]{.mark}]{.underline} for politics and policy," Summers says. "[It
is hard to imagine avoiding a resurgence of **[protectionism,
populism]{.mark}, and [scapegoating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such a
scenario, as with another financial crisis, **[the centre will not
hold]{.underline}**."

It's hard to imagine, too, the severity of the next airplane-like crash
in global markets.

### Decline can't solve

#### Can't Solve Warming

Massachusetts Amherst and founding co-director of its Political Economy

Greenhouse Gases?," Naked Capitalism, June 6 2016,

jwg)

Okay. Thanks again for having me on. I want to say, first of all, that I
certainly share a lot of the concerns that Peter and many other
proponents of degrowth, or variations thereof, have with respect, first
of all, to using GDP as a measure of welfare, thinking that GDP is the
be-all, end-all, that economies have to grow to make living standards
better. I share all of those concerns. I want to focus strictly on the
issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, CO2
emissions, which constitute about 80 percent of greenhouse gas
emissions. And my point is very straightforward. We have to[, if we take
even the conservative assumptions of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the IPCC, we have to reduce emissions somewhere in the
range of 40 percent within 20 years]{.underline}, [80 percent by
2050,]{.underline} 35 years, [and certainly by the end of this century
eliminate CO2 emissions from energy altogether.]{.underline} In order to
do that, **[we simply [can't get close]{.mark} to that goal [by reducing
GDP]{.mark} alone. GDP reduction, degrowth, is not a solution to climate
stabilization. What [we have to]{.mark} do instead is [invest]{.mark}
massively [in clean tech]{.mark}nologies, renewable energy, and in high
energy efficiency. That in my view is the only way, even if you're a
proponent of degrowth for other reasons, it is simply not a solution in
terms of climate stabilization]{.underline}**.

## 1AR\-\--Sustainable

### Growth Sustainable

#### Capitalism reforms itself 

**Kaletsky 10** \[Anatole Kaletsky, MA Economics from Harvard, Economics
Editor of The Times, Chairman of the Institute for New Economic
Thinking, "Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath
of Crisis", p. 1-3\]

[[The world did not end. Despite]{.mark} all the forebodings of
[disaster in the]{.mark} 2007-- 09 financial [crisis]{.mark}, the first
decade of the twenty-first century passed rather uneventfully into the
second. The riots, soup kitchens, and bankruptcies predicted by many of
the world's most respected economists did not materialize--- and **[no
one]{.mark} any longer [expects the global]{.mark} capitalist [system to
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whatever that emotive word might mean.
Yet the capitalist system's survival does not mean that the precrisis
faith in the wisdom of financial markets and the efficiency of free
enterprise will ever again be what it was before the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. [A return to decent economic
growth and normal financial conditions is likely]{.underline} by the
middle of 2010, but will this imply a return to business as usual for
politicians, economists, and financiers? Although globalization will
continue and many parts of the world will gradually regain their
prosperity of the precrisis period, the traumatic effects of 2007-- 09
will not be quickly forgotten. And the economic costs will linger for
decades in the debts squeezing taxpayers and government budgets, the
disrupted lives of the jobless, and the vanished dreams of homeowners
and investors around the world. For what collapsed on September 15,
2008, was not just a bank or a financial system. What fell apart that
day was an entire political philosophy and economic system, a way of
thinking about and living in the world. The question now is what will
replace the global capitalism that crumbled in the autumn of 2008. The
central argument of this book is that [**[global capitalism will be
replaced by nothing other than]{.mark} global
[capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [[traumatic
events]{.underline}]{.mark} of 2007-- 09 [[will neither destroy nor
diminish the]{.mark} fundamental human [urges that have always powered
the]{.mark} capitalist [system]{.mark}--- ambition, initiative,
individualism, the competitive spirit. [These natural]{.mark} human
[qualities will]{.mark} instead [be]{.mark} **redirected and
[reenergized]{.mark}** to create a new version of capitalism that will
ultimately be even more successful and productive than the system it
replaced.]{.underline} To explain this process of renewal, and identify
some of the most important features of the reinvigorated capitalist
system, is the ambition of this book. This transformation will take many
years to complete, but some of its consequences can already be
discerned. With the benefit of even a year's hindsight, it is clear that
[these consequences will be different from the nihilistic predictions
from both ends of the political spectrum at the height of the
crisis.]{.underline} On the Left, [anticapitalist ideologues seemed
honestly to believe that a few weeks of financial chaos could bring
about the disintegration of a politico-economic system that had survived
two hundred years of revolutions, depressions, and world
wars.]{.underline} On the Right, free-market zealots insisted that
private enterprise would be destroyed by government interventions that
were clearly necessary to save the system--- and many continue to
believe that the crisis could have been resolved much better if
governments had simply allowed financial institutions to collapse. A
balanced reassessment of the crisis must challenge both left-wing
hysteria and right-wing hubris. [Rather than blaming the meltdown of the
global financial system on greedy bankers]{.underline}, incompetent
regulators, gullible homeowners, or foolish Chinese bureaucrats, this
book [put]{.underline}s [what happened into historical and ideological
perspective. It reinterprets the crisis in the context of the economic
reforms and geopolitical upheavals that have repeatedly transformed the
nature of capitalism since the late eighteenth century]{.underline},
most recently in the Thatcher-Reagan revolution of 1979-- 89. The
central argument is that [[capitalism has **never been**]{.mark} **a
[static]{.mark} system** that follows a fixed set of rules,
characterized by a permanent division of responsibilities between
private enterprise and governments.]{.underline} Contrary to the
teachings of modern economic theory, **[[no immutable laws govern the
behavior of a]{.mark} capitalist [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Instead, [[capitalism is an **adaptive**]{.mark} **social [system that
mutates]{.mark} and evolves [in response to a changing
environment.]{.mark}** [When capitalism is]{.mark} seriously
[threatened]{.mark} by a systemic crisis, [a new version emerges that is
better suited]{.mark} to the changing environment and replaces the
previously dominant form.]{.underline} Once we recognize that
[[capitalism is]{.mark} not a static set of institutions, but [an
**evolutionary system that reinvents**]{.mark} **and reinvigorates
[itself through crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}, we can see the events of
2007-- 09 in another light: as the catalyst for the fourth systemic
transformation of capitalism, comparable to the transformations
triggered by the crises of the 1970s, the crises of the 1930s, and the
Napoleonic Wars of 1803-- 15. Hence the title of this book.

#### Long-term growth is sustainable -- bounces back from shocks.

**Hawksworth 17** \[John Hawksworth, Chief Economist at PwC UK, "The
Long View How will the global economic order change by 2050?", February

The long view: how will the global economic order change by 2050? After
a year of major political shocks with the Brexit vote and the election
of President Trump, it might seem brave to opine on economic prospects
for 2017, let alone 2050. However, I still think [[it is important to
take a longer term view of]{.mark} global [economic prospects]{.mark}
that looks beyond the [short-term ups and downs]{.mark} of the economic
and political cycle]{.underline}, which are indeed very difficult to
forecast. Instead [our approach [in this report, based on]{.mark} a
[rigorous modelling]{.mark} approach, focuses on the fundamental drivers
of growth]{.underline}: demographics and [productivity]{.underline},
which in turn is [[driven by tech]{.mark}nological progress]{.underline}
and [[diffused through]{.mark} international [trade]{.mark} and
investment. [Such forces saw America progress]{.mark} through the 19th
[and]{.mark} early 20th centuries to [become the largest economy in the
world]{.mark} despite a civil war, various other conflicts with foreign
powers, three presidential assassinations, and numerous economic and
financial crises. [These forces]{.mark} also [helped]{.mark}
[global]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} to [bounce back]{.mark}
strongly from two world wars and a Great Depression to reach record
levels in the post-war decades.]{.underline} Looking ahead, we think
they will see emerging economies come to dominate the 21st century. By
2050 we project China will be the largest economy in the world by a
significant margin, while India could have edged past the US into second
place and Indonesia have risen to fourth place. The EU27's share of
global GDP could have fallen to below 10%. We also think [[the]{.mark}
world [economy will more than double]{.mark} in size [between now and
2050,]{.mark}]{.underline} far outstripping population growth. I think
[this kind of long-term view]{.underline}, looking beyond short-term
economic and political cycles, [is particularly useful for
policymakers]{.underline} and businesses [in areas like]{.underline}
pensions, [healthcare, energy and climate change]{.underline},
transport, housing and other types of infrastructure investment.
Challenges for policymakers Of course, we should not dismiss political
shocks like Trump or Brexit to the extent they point to deeper
structural shifts, notably a populist backlash against globalisation,
automation and the perceived impact of these trends in increasing income
inequality and weakening social cohesion. These trends pose real policy
challenges across the developed world and beyond and, as we discuss in
Section 4 of this report, there is no silver bullet to address these
concerns. They require determined efforts by governments to boost the
quality of education and training, and address perceived unfairness
through welltargeted fiscal policies. They also require real political
leadership to resist calls for increased protectionism and maintain
momentum on longer term issues like climate change and global poverty
reduction. Opportunities for business From a business perspective[,
[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [a need to look beyond]{.mark}
short-term economic [volatility in both advanced and emerging
economies]{.mark}]{.underline} and develop strategies that have the
right balance of flexibility and patience. As we discuss in Section 5 of
the report, this requires a clear focus on identifying and building on
core capabilities, while remaining flexible enough to ride out short
term political and economic storms of the kind we have seen in both
advanced and emerging economies in recent years. Overall, though, I
remain optimistic that [governments and businesses can rise to these
challenges and deliver the continued increases in global living
standards]{.underline} that we project in this report.

### AT: K Waves

**K Waves are wrong**

**[North, '09]{.underline}** (Gary, economist and publisher and PhD in
history from the University of California, Riverside, The Myth of the
Kondratieff Wave, http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north725.html,
6/27/09)

THE K-WAVE These days, **[the Kondratieff Wave]{.underline}** has a
spiffy new name: the K-Wave. (I can almost hear it: \"Attention: K-Wave
shoppers!\") The K-**[Wave is supposedly going to bring a deflationary
collapse Real Soon]{.underline}** Now. The Western world\'s debt
structure will disappear in a wave of defaults. Kondratieff\'s 54-year
cycle is almost upon us. Again. **[The last deflationary period ended in
1933. This became clear no later than 1940.]{.underline}** World War II
orders from Great Britain, funded by American loans and Federal Reserve
policy, ended the Great Depression by lowering real wages. In 1942,
price and wage controls were imposed by Washington, the FED began
pumping out new money, ration stamps replaced the free market, the black
market overcame shortages, and the inflationary era began. That was a
long time ago. But the K-Wave is heralded as a 50 to 60-year cycle, or
even more specifically, a 54-year cycle. That\'s the entire cycle,
trough to trough or peak to peak. **[The K-Wave supposedly should have
bottomed in 1933, risen for 27 years (1960), declined in economic
contraction until 1987, and boomed thereafter. The peak should therefore
be in 2014. There is a problem here: the cyclical [decline]{.mark} from
1960 to 1987. It [never materialized.]{.mark} Prices kept rising,
escalating with a vengeance after 1968, then slowing somewhat -- just in
time for the longest stock market boom in American history:
1982--2000.]{.underline}** OK, **[say the K-Wavers: let\'s extend the
cycle to 60 years. Fine. Let\'s do just that. Boom, 1932--62; bust,
1963--93; boom, 1994--2024. [Does this correspond to anything that
happened in American economic history since 1932?
No.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### AT: Limits to Growth

#### No ecological limits\-\--Tech key 

**Lomborg 13**---adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School,
(Bjørn, "The Limits to Panic",
<http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-growth-and-its-critics-by-bj-rn-lomborg>,
dml)

[[The genius of The Limits to Growth was to fuse]{.mark} these worries
with [fears of running out of stuff]{.mark}. We were doomed, because too
many people would consume too much]{.underline}. Even if our ingenuity
bought us some time, we would end up killing the planet and ourselves
with pollution. **[[The only hope was to stop]{.mark} economic [growth
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**, cut consumption, recycle, and force
people to have fewer children, [stabilizing society at a significantly
poorer level. That message still resonates today, **though [it was
spectacularly wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [the
authors]{.underline} of The Limits to Growth [predicted that before
2013, the world would have run out of aluminum, copper, gold, lead,
mercury, molybdenum, natural gas, oil, silver, tin, tungsten, and
zinc]{.underline}. Instead, [despite recent increases, [commodity prices
have]{.mark} generally [fallen]{.mark} to **about a third of their level
150 years ago**. [Tech]{.mark}nological [innovations have replaced
mercury]{.mark}]{.underline} in batteries, dental fillings, and
thermometers: [mercury consumption is down 98% and, by 2000, the price
was down 90%.]{.underline} More broadly, since 1946, [[supplies of
copper, aluminum, iron, and zinc have outstripped consumption]{.mark},
[owing to]{.mark} **the discovery of [additional reserves and new
technologies]{.mark} to extract them economically**.]{.underline}
Similarly, [oil and natural gas were to run out in 1990 and
1992]{.underline}, respectively; [today, **reserves of both are larger
than they were in 1970**]{.underline}, although we consume dramatically
more. Within the past six years, [**shale gas alone has doubled
potential gas resources** in the United States and halved the
price.]{.underline} As for economic collapse, [the
I]{.underline}ntergovernmental [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange [estimates that global GDP
per capita will increase 14-fold over this century and 24-fold in the
developing world]{.underline}. [[The Limits of Growth]{.mark} got it so
wrong because **its [authors]{.mark} [overlooked]{.mark} the greatest
resource of all: [our own resourcefulness]{.mark}**. **[Population
growth has been slowing]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the late 1960's.
**[[Food supply has not collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark}** (1.5 billion
hectares of arable land are being used, but another [2.7 billion
hectares are in reserve]{.underline}). [**Malnourishment has dropped by
more than half**, from 35% of the world's population to under 16%. Nor
are we choking on pollution]{.underline}. Whereas the Club of Rome
imagined an idyllic past with no particulate air pollution and happy
farmers, and a future strangled by belching smokestacks, reality is
entirely the reverse. [[In 1900]{.mark}, when the global human
population was 1.5 billion, almost [three million
people]{.mark}]{.underline} -- roughly one in 500 -- [[died each year
from air pollution]{.mark}, mostly from wretched indoor air. [Today, the
risk has receded to one death per 2,000]{.mark} people]{.underline}.
While pollution still kills more people than malaria does, the mortality
rate is falling, not rising. Nonetheless, [the mindset]{.underline}
nurtured by The Limits to Growth [continues to shape popular and elite
thinking.]{.underline} Consider recycling, which is often just a
feel-good gesture with little environmental benefit and significant
cost. Paper, for example, typically comes from sustainable forests, not
rainforests. The processing and government subsidies associated with
recycling yield lower-quality paper to save a resource that is not
threatened. Likewise, **[fears of over-population framed
self-destructive policies]{.underline}**, such as China's one-child
policy and forced sterilization in India. And, [while pesticides and
other pollutants were seen to kill off perhaps half of humanity,
well-regulated pesticides cause about 20 deaths each year in the US,
whereas they have **significant upsides** in creating cheaper and more
plentiful food.]{.underline} Indeed, [reliance solely on organic
farming]{.underline} -- a movement inspired by the pesticide fear --
[**would cost more than \$100 billion annually in the US**.]{.underline}
At 16% lower efficiency, current output would require another 65 million
acres of farmland -- an area more than half the size of California.
[Higher prices would reduce consumption of fruits and vegetables,
causing myriad adverse health effects]{.underline} (including tens of
thousands of additional cancer deaths per year). [[Obsession with
doom-and-gloom]{.mark} scenarios [**distracts us from the real global
threats**.]{.mark} [Poverty is **one of the greatest killers**]{.mark}
**of all**, [while **easily curable diseases**]{.mark} still [claim 15
million lives every year]{.mark} -- 25% of all deaths. **[The solution
is economic growth]{.mark}**. [When lifted out of poverty, **most people
can afford to avoid infectious diseases**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China
has pulled more than 680 million people out of poverty in the last three
decades, leading a worldwide poverty decline of almost a billion people.
**This has created massive improvements in health, longevity, and
quality of life**]{.underline}. [The four decades since The Limits of
Growth **have shown that we need more of it, not less**. [An **expansion
of trade**,]{.mark} with estimated benefits exceeding \$100 trillion
annually]{.underline} toward the end of the century, [**[would do
thousands of times more good]{.mark}** than timid feel-good policies
that result from fear-mongering. But **[that requires abandoning an
anti-growth mentality]{.mark}** and using our enormous potential to
create a brighter future]{.underline}.

## 1AR\-\--Decline Bad

### Decline = War

#### Economic crisis [post-2018]{.underline} guarantees global conflict\-\--resilience is [wrong]{.underline}, the liberal order's [weak]{.underline} and [current]{.underline} leaders won't be cooperative 

William **Pesek 18**, former columnist for Barron's and Bloomberg,
quoting former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Eurasia Group
President Ian Bremmer, 1/12/18, "Why a 2018 crisis would be particularly
devastating,"
http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/iLkHAL2cCCxfOqYvRzFAsL/Why-a-2018-crisis-would-be-particularly-devastating.html

Twenty years ago, Lawrence Summers came up with a particularly graphic
analogy for market crises: airplane crashes.

Jets, the former US treasury secretary explained, make travel faster,
more efficient and safer, although the odd accident is far more stunning
and deadly than one that befalls other forms of transport. "In the same
way," Summers said, "modern global financial markets carry with them
enormous potential for benefit, even if some of the accidents are that
much more spectacular."

This comparison leaps to mind as Summers sounds the alarm about 2018.
[Summers's core policy belief is this: even when the periphery of [the
global economy]{.mark}]{.underline} (emerging markets) [plunges, the
centre]{.underline} (developed ones) [is solid enough to hold capitalism
together. Increasingly]{.underline}, Summers believes **[that centre
[might crack in]{.mark} the event of [new
turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[even within the 12 months
ahead]{.underline}.

[Stock [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Summers points out in recent
speeches and op-eds, [[are]{.mark} going
[gangbusters]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's [[despite the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} being in the hands of a leader threatening trade
wars, redistributing wealth to the top 1%, **[[taunting nuclear states
via Twitter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, spouting untruths, attacking the
media, [flouting international laws, [trampling]{.mark} on [democratic
values]{.mark}]{.underline} and cozying up to autocrats Washington used
to abhor.

[[China, Russia, Turkey]{.mark} and [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline},
Summers argues, [[are "more authoritarian]{.mark}, more nationalist and
[more truculent on the world stage]{.mark} than they were a year ago."
[North Korea is growing]{.mark} more [belligerent]{.mark}]{.underline},
more erratic [and more nuclear]{.underline} year after year.
[Europe]{.underline}, meanwhile, remains traumatized by Britain's exit
from the European Union (EU) and [faces myriad populist and far-right
insurgencies]{.underline}.

All this begs the question: why, oh why, are equity markets surging as
if investors haven't a care? Why are bond yields so impossibly low from
Washington to Tokyo as leaders borrow with abandon? Perhaps Bitcoin's
bewildering bull run is more a symptom of the extent to which markets
have lost all sense of reality than an anomaly.

Trouble is, [the global economy's surface looks infinitely better than
the foundations]{.underline} beneath it. "Yes, [[markets are
soaring]{.mark} and the economy isn't bad, [but]{.mark} citizens are
divided," says]{.underline} Ian [Bremmer, president of Eurasia
Group]{.underline}. "Governments aren't doing much governing. And **[the
[global order is unraveling]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

[[What happens if]{.mark} there is some kind of reckoning?]{.underline}
Say **[[if Wall Street hit a 2008-like wall]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
China's debt meltdown arrived or Washington started a trade war. A major
terrorist attack, conflict on the Korean peninsula, confrontation in the
South China Sea or troubles in Iran or Pakistan could slam markets.

At the same moment, ["the scale of the world's political challenges is
daunting]{.underline}", Bremmer says. "[Liberal democracies have less
legitimacy than at any time since World War II]{.underline}, and most of
their structural problems don't appear fixable. [[Today's]{.mark}
strongest [leaders show little interest in]{.mark}]{.underline} civil
society or [[common values]{.underline}]{.mark}." Looking at the past
two decades, [if his team "had to pick one year for a big unexpected
crisis]{.underline}---the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial
meltdown---**[it feels like 2018]{.underline}**," Bremmer says.

[Summers worries geopolitics and economics will collide]{.underline}.
"Financial markets are widely cited, including by US President Donald
Trump, as providing comfort in the current moment," he says. "But [**a
[relapse into financial crisis would]{.mark} likely [have catastrophic
political consequences]{.mark}**, sweeping into power even more toxic
populist nationalists]{.underline}."

My objective here isn't to give readers sleepless nights, but to call
out the gaping disconnect between jubilant markets and the chaos that
may lie ahead.

[Asia learned a great deal from its 1997-98 meltdown]{.underline}. Banks
were strengthened, currencies became more flexible, central banks
amassed ample currency reserves and governments increased transparency.
After that 2013 "taper tantrum," India, for example, worked to stabilize
the rupee, tame inflation and address bad loans in the banking system.
[[The West learned]{.mark} far [less from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[20[08]{.mark}]{.underline} Lehman Brothers crash, throwing money at the
problem, but demurring on painful reforms. **[[Banks are
re-leveraging]{.mark} as we speak]{.underline}**.

[[Market meltdowns]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[happen]{.mark}
**sooner and [faster than punters expect]{.mark}**[. In]{.mark} 20[08,
the US responded by cutting]{.mark} short-term [rates]{.mark} 500 basis
points]{.underline} (one basis point is 0.01 percentage point), while
peers in Europe and Japan followed suit. [**[Such a response isn't
available in 2018]{.mark}**. Nor is aggressive fiscal
loosening]{.underline}. The Trump White House already engineered a \$1.5
trillion tax cut the economy didn't need.

[That]{.underline}, Summers says, [means [**the next recession will be
"protracted and deep**, with **severe global consequences**]{.mark}." In
2009]{.underline}, after Wall Street cracked, then-US President Barack
[[Obama cobbled together]{.mark} a global [response with
**G**]{.mark}]{.underline}roup of [**[20]{.mark}** nations. [Trump has
**gone the other way**]{.mark}, alienating]{.underline} most of the
[allies Obama worked with to restore global calm]{.underline}.

"I shudder to think what [a [serious recession will
mean]{.mark}]{.underline} for politics and policy," Summers says. "[It
is hard to imagine avoiding a resurgence of **[protectionism,
populism]{.mark}, and [scapegoating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such a
scenario, as with another financial crisis, **[the centre will not
hold]{.underline}**."

It's hard to imagine, too, the severity of the next airplane-like crash
in global markets.

### Nuclear War = Extinction

#### Global collapse means no resources to guard nuclear weapons \-\-- theft, prolif, and collapse virtually guaranteed because Tonneson says decline increases incentive to sell nukes, causes extinction

**Starr 14** \[Steven, the Senior Scientist for Physicians for Social
Responsibility and Director of the Clinical Laboratory Science Program
at the University of Missouri, 5/30/14, "The Lethality of Nuclear
Weapons,"
<http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/05/30/lethality-nuclear-weapons>\]

[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}. Beginning in 2006, several of
[the world's leading climatologists]{.underline} (at Rutgers, UCLA, John
Hopkins University, and the University of Colorado-Boulder) [published a
series of studies that evaluated the long-term environmental
consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}, including baseline scenarios
fought with merely 1% of the explosive power in the US and/or Russian
launch-ready nuclear arsenals. They concluded that the [consequences of
[even a "small" nuclear war would include catastrophic disruptions
of]{.mark} global [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}\[i\] [and massive
destruction of Earth's protective ozone layer]{.underline}\[ii\]. These
and more recent studies predict that global agriculture would be so
negatively affected by such a war, a global famine would result, which
would cause up to 2 billion people to starve to death. \[iii\] [These
[peer-reviewed studies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which were [[analyzed by
the **best scientists in the world** and found]{.mark} to be [without
error]{.mark}]{.underline} -- also [[predict]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[a [war]{.mark} fought [with less than half of US]{.mark} or Russian
strategic nuclear [weapons would **destroy the human
race**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[iv\] In other words, [a US-Russian nuclear
war would create such extreme long-term damage to the global
environment]{.underline} that [**[it would leave the Earth uninhabitable
for humans]{.mark}** and most animal forms of life]{.underline}. A
recent article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "Self-assured
destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear war",\[v\] begins by
stating: "[A nuclear war between Russia and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [even after the arsenal reductions planned under
New START, could produce a nuclear winter]{.underline}. Hence, an attack
by either side could be suicidal, resulting in self-assured
destruction." In 2009, I wrote an article\[vi\] for the International
Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament that summarizes
the findings of these studies. It explains that nuclear firestorms would
produce millions of tons of smoke, which would rise above cloud level
and form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would rapidly encircle
the Earth. The smoke layer would remain for at least a decade, and it
would act to destroy the protective ozone layer (vastly increasing the
UV-B reaching Earth\[vii\]) as well as block warming sunlight, thus
creating Ice Age weather conditions that would last 10 years or longer.
Following a US-Russian nuclear war, temperatures in the central US and
Eurasia would fall below freezing every day for one to three years; the
intense cold would completely eliminate growing seasons for a decade or
longer. No crops could be grown, leading to a famine that would kill
most humans and large animal populations.
[**[E]{.mark}**lectro**[m]{.mark}**agnetic
**[p]{.mark}**ulse]{.underline} from high-altitude nuclear detonations
[[would destroy]{.underline}]{.mark} the integrated circuits in
[[all]{.mark} modern [electronic devices]{.mark}]{.underline}\[viii\],
including those in commercial nuclear power plants**[. [Every nuclear
reactor would]{.mark} almost [instantly meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
[every]{.underline} nuclear [spent fuel pool]{.underline} (which contain
many times more radioactivity than found in the reactors) [would
boil-off, r[eleasing vast]{.mark}]{.underline} amounts of long-lived
[[radioactivity]{.mark}]{.underline} . The fallout would make most of
the US and Europe uninhabitable. Of course, the survivors of the nuclear
war would be starving to death anyway. [Once nuclear weapons were
introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would be little chance that
a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. [Theories of]{.mark}]{.underline}
"limited nuclear war" and "[[nuclear de-escalation" are
unrealistic]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[ix\] In 2002 the Bush administration
modified US strategic doctrine from a retaliatory role to permit
preemptive nuclear attack; in 2010, the Obama administration made only
incremental and miniscule changes to this doctrine, leaving it
essentially unchanged. Furthermore, Counterforce doctrinex -- used by
both the US and Russian military -- emphasizes the need for preemptive
strikes once nuclear war begins Both sides would be under immense
pressure to launch a preemptive nuclear first-strike once military
hostilities had commenced, especially if nuclear weapons had already
been used on the battlefield. Both [the US and Russia]{.underline} each
[have]{.underline} 400 to [500 launch-ready ballistic missiles armed
with a total of at least 1800 strategic nuclear
warheads]{.underline},\[xi\] which can be launched with only a few
minutes warning.\[xii\] Both the US and Russian Presidents are
accompanied 24/7 by military officers carrying a "nuclear briefcase",
which allows them to transmit the permission order to launch in a matter
of seconds. Yet top political leaders and policymakers of both the US
and Russia seem to be unaware that their [launch-ready nuclear weapons
represent a self-destruct mechanism for the human race]{.underline}. For
example, in 2010, I was able to publicly question the chief negotiators
of the New START treaty, Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and (then)
US Assistant Secretary of State, Rose Gottemoeller, during their joint
briefing at the UN (during the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review
Conference). I asked them if they were familiar with the recent
peer-reviewed studies that predicted the detonation of less than 1% of
the explosive power contained in the operational and deployed U.S. and
Russian nuclear forces would cause catastrophic changes in the global
climate, and that a nuclear war fought with their strategic nuclear
weapons would kill most people on Earth. They both answered "no." More
recently, on April 20, 2014, I asked the same question and received the
same answer from the US officials sent to brief representatives of the
NGOS at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee meeting at
the UN. None of the US officials at the briefing were aware of the
studies. Those present included top officials of the National Security
Council. It is frightening that President Obama and his administration
appear unaware that the world's leading scientists have for years
predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or Russian strategic
nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do they not know of the
existential threat these arsenals pose to the human race . . . or do
they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn't fit into their
official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats that could
destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human extinction
from nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and Russia are
each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a US-Russian war.
Even more frightening is the fact that the neocons running US foreign
policy believe that the US has "nuclear primacy" over Russia; that is,
the US could successfully launch a nuclear sneak attack against Russian
(and Chinese) nuclear forces and completely destroy them. This theory
was articulated in 2006 in "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy", which was
published in Foreign Affairs by the Council on Foreign
Relations.\[xiii\] By concluding that the Russians and Chinese would be
unable to retaliate, or if some small part of their forces remained,
would not risk a second US attack by retaliating, the article invites
nuclear war. Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge of security of
the Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems for 7 years)
asked me to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled "[Nuclear
Primacy is a Fallacy]{.underline}".\[xiv\] Colonel Yarynich, who was on
the Soviet General Staff and did war planning for the USSR, concluded
that the "Primacy" article used faulty methodology and erroneous
assumptions, thus invalidating its conclusions. My contribution lay in
my knowledge of the recently published (in 2006) studies, which
predicted [even a "successful" nuclear first-strike, which destroyed
100% of the opposing sides nuclear weapons, would cause the citizens of
the side that "won" the nuclear war to perish from nuclear famine, just
as would the rest of humanity]{.underline}. Although the nuclear primacy
article created quite a backlash in Russia, leading to a public speech
by the Russian Foreign Minister, the story was essentially not covered
in the US press. We were unable to get our rebuttal published by US
media. The question remains as to whether the US nuclear primacy
asserted in the article has been accepted as a fact by the US political
and military establishment. Such acceptance would explain the
recklessness of US policy toward Russia and China. Thus we find
ourselves in a situation in which those who are in charge of our nuclear
arsenal seem not to understand that they can end human history if they
choose to push the button. Most of the American public also remains
completely unaware of this deadly threat. The uninformed are leading the
uninformed toward the abyss of extinction. US public schools have not
taught students about nuclear weapons for more than 20 years. The last
time nuclear war was discussed or debated in a US Presidential election
was sometime in the last century. Thus, most people do not know that a
single strategic nuclear weapon can easily ignite a massive firestorm
over 100 square miles, and that the US and Russia each have many
thousands of these weapons ready for immediate use. Meanwhile,
neoconservative ideology has kept the US at war during the entire 21st
century. It has led to the expansion of US/NATO forces to the very
borders of Russia, a huge mistake that has consequently revived the Cold
War. A hallmark of neconservatism is that America is the "indispensable
nation", as evidenced by the neoconservative belief in "American
exceptionalism", which essentially asserts that Americans are superior
to all other peoples, that American interests and values should reign
supreme in the world. At his West Point speech on May 28, President
Obama said, "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my
being." Obama stated his bottom line is that "America must always lead
on the world stage," and "the backbone of that leadership always will be
the military." American exceptionalism based on might, not diplomacy, on
hard power, not soft, is precisely the hubris and arrogance that could
lead to the termination of human life. Washington's determination to
prevent the rise of Russia and China, as set out in the Brzezinski and
Wolfowitz doctrines, is a recipe for nuclear war. The need is dire for
the president of the US, Russia, or China to state in a highly public
forum that the existence of [nuclear weapons]{.underline} creates the
possibility of their use and that their [use in war would likely mean
human extinction]{.underline}. As nuclear war has no winners, the
weapons should be banned and destroyed before they destroy all of us.

## 1AR\-\--Growth Good

### Growth Solves Warming

#### Only the market has the scope and scale to drive climate solutions quickly enough to avert catastrophic impacts

**Gunther 15** -- writer for the Guardian, citing Ramez Naam, holds a

Natural resources -- notably the atmosphere's capacity to absorb
greenhouse gases -- may be limited, Naam argues, but ideas and
innovation are not. Lately, Naam has been sharing his can-do optimism,
along with specific solutions, on his blog, at conferences (most
recently Sustainable Brands) and as a teacher at Singularity University,
a think tank designed to inspire and equip business leaders to tackle
humanity's big problems. None is bigger than climate change, Raam told

political and scientific dimensions. [[The costs of fixing climate
change are]{.mark} short term and [local; the benefits are long term and
global]{.mark}. [Equity issues]{.mark}, meaning who should pay for

billions of people out of poverty, feeding a growing planet and
stewarding water resources while reducing greenhouse gas emissions "may
well be the largest challenge that humanity has ever faced", Naam says.
"[[The problems are vast]{.mark}. They're very substantial. They will
not solve themselves on their own. [But]{.mark} if we make a concerted
effort, they are [not insurmountable]{.mark}."]{.underline} What's to be
done? [When Naam talks about innovation, he's not talking simply about
new technology. Innovative business models and policy are vital.
"[Technology innovation]{.mark} is often facilitated or bootstrapped by
policy innovation, and it['s driven along by business-model
innovation]{.mark}," he says[. All require strong business
leadership]{.mark} from big companies and startups alike]{.underline},
he says. Naam argues that [capitalism isn't the enemy of
climate,]{.underline} as Naomi Klein has written; to the contrary,
**[[well-regulated markets will drive climate
solutions.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Consider solar power, one of the
technologies, along with wind, battery storage and, possibly, nuclear,
that he's counting on to transform the world's energy system. "[Over the
last 35 years or so," he says, "[the price of solar modules has
dropped]{.mark} by a staggering [150 times]{.mark}." This is promising
news]{.underline}, [especially, to the more than one billion people
without electricity]{.underline}, most in Africa and South Asia. They
"almost all live in the sunny parts of the world, a lucky coincidence
for us and for them", he says. With help from the World Bank, India is
now building what will likely be the world's largest solar plant. "This
is a disruptive technology," Naam says. [[To rapidly drive]{.mark} the
[uptake]{.mark} of solar, though, [business-model innovation is
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}. The US firm Solar City, for example, came
up with what in retrospect is a simple idea: finance the upfront capital
costs of solar for homeowners and businesses so they can pay-as-they-go
and realize immediate savings. "That was a triple bottom line win," Naam
says. "It was good for the customers, it was the good for the planet.
And Solar City created a \$6bn market cap out of thin air." Many big
companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, are already major
buyers of clean energy, which drives prices down. "Every company and
person that deploys clean energy makes it cheaper for everybody else,"
Naam says. Now business leaders must take the next step, and become
forceful advocates for smart clean energy policy, as Apple's Tim Cook
did last fall. Policy is the toughest nut to crack, Naam says. Solar
would not be thriving without government subsidies in the US and, even
more so, in Germany. [[To drive clean-energy innovation faster]{.mark}
and further, [Naam]{.mark}, [like]{.mark} a growing number of [business
leaders and economists across the political spectrum]{.mark}, [advocates
a carbon tax]{.mark}.]{.underline} He's got a simple, four-point plan
for a carbon tax. First, pass the tax, give businesses and consumers
five years to prepare for it, and start it at just \$10 per ton of CO2.
Second, raise the price by \$10 a year until the US meets its emission
targets. Third, put a tax on imports from countries that don't tax
carbon. Fourth, give all the money back to taxpayers, probably by
reducing payroll of income taxes. States and cities are already adopting
innovative climate policies. Washington will follow, Naam predicts, as
the cost of climate solutions continue to fall, and the costs of
inaction become clear. "We'll make progress when those two lines cross,"
he says.

#### Only growth solves warming fast enough -- markets force sustainability.

https://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/capitalism-is-the-solution-to-climate-change-commentary.html\]

Environmentalists around the world are pinning their hopes on the
international climate talks happening now. But [conference rooms in
Paris are not where the action on climate change really is. Rather,
it\'s in boardrooms around the world. Companies large and small are
taking steps to protect the environment, while increasing their
profits.]{.underline} They\'re [motivated]{.underline} not by consensus
or conservation, but [by cold hard cash.]{.underline} It\'s true that
industry has contributed enormously to climate change and environmental
degradation. Business interests have long opposed sustainable practices
they believed would negatively impact profits. And the environmental
community has held fast to this dynamic, holding up industry and
capitalism as the enemy for decades. But the truth is that
[**[capitalism is the only force strong enough and capable of acting
quickly]{.mark} enough [to address climate change before]{.mark} the
[damage becomes irreversible]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} I\'ve seen the kind of
positive effect business can have on our environment when driven
by]{.underline} profit and [economic growth]{.underline} --- and
[in]{.underline} one of [the world\'s largest, dirtiest
industries]{.underline} no less: real estate. In 1993, I co-founded the
U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit organization dedicated
to sustainability in our built environment. USGBC created a voluntary
rating system --- Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED
--- which allows buildings to earn credits for their sustainable
features, including energy and water efficiency, indoor environmental
quality, and recycled materials. LEED has had a dramatic impact on
profits and the planet. In just 15 short years, 14 billion square feet
of real estate have been LEED registered and certified in more than 150
countries, including some of the most iconic buildings in the world,
from the Chrysler Building in Manhattan, which reduced energy use by 21
percent, to Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles,
which has reduced its energy consumption by the equivalent of removing
41,000 cars per year from the road. Thanks to LEED, as legendary
environmentalist Paul Hawken put it, \"[USGBC may have had a greater
impact than any other single organization in the world on materials
saved, [toxins eliminated, greenhouse gases avoided, and human health
enhanced.]{.mark}\"]{.underline} But the [[benefits are more than just
environmental --- they\'re economic]{.mark}. From hospitals to schools
to skyscrapers to factories, communities and companies that have
invested in LEED see energy savings, cost savings, and a significant
return on their investment.]{.underline} And green buildings haven\'t
only been profitable for building owners, but also for the American
economy at large. [[Green construction added \$167.4 billion to
the]{.mark} U.S. [GDP]{.mark}]{.underline} from 2011 to 2014, according
to a new 2015 Green Building Economic Impact Study. This year, the green
building sector will employ more than 2.3 million Americans, and by
2018, it is expected to nearly double in size. Of course, real estate
isn\'t the only industry where economic and environmental benefits
align. Today, [**[the power of sustainability to drive profits
is]{.mark} being quietly [embraced throughout the]{.mark} global
[economy]{.mark}**, and major companies are reaping the
benefits.]{.underline} Take United Technologies, the manufacturing
powerhouse that ranks 45th on the Fortune 500 list. [Between 2006 and
2014, UTC reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent, and water
use by 33 percent. Over those same eight years, its stock price more
than doubled.]{.underline} Unilever, one of the world\'s largest
consumer-goods companies, has reduced emissions by 37 percent since
2008, and its efforts have saved the company more than 400 million euros
(US\$422 million). GE\'s Ecomagination program has boosted its top line
by \$200 billion over the past decade, growing at four times the rate of
the company at large. Last year, Siemens\' Environmental Portfolio not
only eliminated 428 million tons of CO2 emissions for its customers, but
also brought in €33 billion. The list goes on and on. As Patagonia\'s
CEO Yvon Chouinard says: \"[[Every time we\'ve made a decision that\'s
right for the planet, it\'s made us more money]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"
[The private sector has long been seen as the enemy of
environmentalism]{.underline}, and for good reason. [But **[times have
changed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Today, a select number of [[enlightened
corporations are wasting less, earning more]{.mark}, [and
proving]{.mark} just [how profitable sustainability can be.]{.mark}
There\'s no reason to keep waiting for an elusive climate
agreement]{.underline}. Instead, let\'s take action to advance
**[[market-driven solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [have the
potential --- and the ability --- to [save the
planet.]{.mark}]{.underline} It\'s time for environmentalists and
[business leaders]{.underline} to [**leverage the profit motive** to
achieve]{.underline} our common goal: [a sustainable]{.underline},
profitable [future]{.underline}.

### Decoupling

#### Long term trends are driving decoupling-- no reason this can't continue, their limits to growth arguments are empirically unsupported

[**Intensifying** many human activities]{.underline} --- particularly
farming, energy extraction, forestry, and settlement --- [so that they
**use less land** and **interfere less** with the natural world is the
**key to decoupling** human development from environmental impacts.
These socioeconomic and technological processes are **central** to
economic modernization and environmental protection. Together they allow
people to **mitigate climate change**, to **spare nature**, and to
**alleviate global poverty**.]{.underline} Although we have to date
written separately, our views are increasingly discussed as a whole. We
call ourselves ecopragmatists and ecomodernists. We offer this statement
to affirm and to clarify our views and to describe our vision for
putting humankind's extraordinary powers in the service of creating a
good Anthropocene. 1. [**[Humanity has flourished]{.mark}** over the
past two centuries. **Average life expectancy** has
increased]{.underline} from 30 to 70 years, resulting in a large and
growing population able to live in many different environments.
[Humanity has made **extraordinary progress** in reducing the incidence
and impacts of **infectious diseases**, and it has become **more
resilient** to extreme weather and other natural disasters.
[Violence]{.mark} in all forms has **declined significantly** and
[is]{.mark} probably at [the **lowest**]{.mark} **per capita level
[ever]{.mark} experienced** by the human species]{.underline}, the
horrors of the 20th century and present-day terrorism notwithstanding.
Globally, [human beings have moved from autocratic government toward
liberal democracy characterized by the rule of law and increased
freedom.]{.underline} Personal, economic, and political [liberties have
spread worldwide]{.underline} and are today largely accepted as
universal values. Modernization liberates women from traditional gender
roles, increasing their control of their fertility. [Historically large
numbers of humans]{.underline} --- [both in percentage and in absolute
terms --- are free from insecurity, penury, and servitude.]{.underline}
At the same time, [human flourishing has **taken a serious toll** on
natural, nonhuman environments and wildlife.]{.underline} Humans use
about half of the planet's ice-free land, mostly for pasture, crops, and
production forestry. Of the land once covered by forests, 20 percent has
been converted to human use. Populations of many mammals, amphibians,
and birds have declined by more than 50 percent in the past 40 years
alone. More than 100 species from those groups went extinct in the 20th
century, and about 785 since 1500. As we write, only four northern white
rhinos are confirmed to exist. Given that humans are completely
dependent on the living biosphere, how is it possible that people are
doing so much damage to natural systems without doing more harm to
themselves? The role that technology plays in reducing humanity's
dependence on nature explains this paradox. Human
[technologies]{.underline}, from those that first enabled agriculture to
replace hunting and gathering, to those that drive today's globalized
economy, [have made humans less reliant upon the many ecosystems that
once provided their only sustenance, even as those same ecosystems have
often been left deeply damaged. Despite frequent assertions]{.underline}
starting in the 1970s [of]{.underline} fundamental "[[limits to
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}," [there is]{.underline} still remarkably
[**little evidence** that human population and economic expansion will
outstrip the capacity to grow food or procure critical material
resources in the foreseeable future]{.underline}. To the degree to which
there are fixed physical [boundaries to]{.underline} human
[consumption]{.underline}, they [[are]{.mark} **so
[theoretical]{.mark}** as to be **functionally
irrelevant**]{.underline}. The amount of solar radiation that hits the
Earth, for instance, is ultimately finite but represents no meaningful
constraint upon human endeavors. [Human civilization can **flourish
for**]{.underline} centuries and [**millennia** on energy delivered from
a closed]{.underline} uranium or thorium fuel [cycle]{.underline}, or
from hydrogen-deuterium fusion. [[With]{.mark} proper [management,
humans are at **no risk** of **lacking**]{.mark} **sufficient
[ag]{.mark}ricultural land** for food]{.underline}. [Given plentiful
land and unlimited energy, substitutes for other material inputs to
human well-being can **easily be found**]{.underline} if those inputs
become scarce or expensive. [There remain]{.underline}, however,
[serious long-term [environmental threats]{.mark} to human
well-being]{.underline}, such as anthropogenic climate change,
stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification. While these
risks are difficult to quantify, [the evidence is clear]{.underline}
today [that they [could cause]{.mark} significant risk of [catastrophic
impacts]{.mark} on societies and ecosystems]{.underline}. Even gradual,
non-catastrophic outcomes associated with these threats are likely to
result in significant human and economic costs as well as rising
ecological losses. Much of the world's population still suffers from
more-immediate local environmental health risks. Indoor and outdoor air
pollution continue to bring premature death and illness to millions
annually. Water pollution and water-borne illness due to pollution and
degradation of watersheds cause similar suffering. 2. Even as human
environmental impacts continue to grow in the aggregate, [a range of
**long-term [trends]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}]{.underline} today
[**[driving]{.mark} significant [decoupling]{.mark}** of human
well-being from environmental impacts.]{.underline} Decoupling occurs in
both relative and absolute terms. Relative decoupling means that human
environmental impacts rise at a slower rate than overall economic
growth. Thus, for each unit of economic output, less environmental
impact (e.g., deforestation, defaunation, pollution) results. Overall
impacts may still increase, just at a slower rate than would otherwise
be the case. Absolute decoupling occurs when total environmental impacts
--- impacts in the aggregate --- peak and begin to decline, even as the
economy continues to grow. [Decoupling can be driven by both
technological and demographic trends and usually results from a
combination of the two]{.underline}. The [growth rate of
the]{.underline} human [population has **already peaked**]{.underline}.
Today's [[population growth]{.underline}]{.mark} rate
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one percent per year,
**[[down]{.underline}]{.mark}** from its high point of 2.1 percent in
the 1970s. Fertility rates in countries containing more than half of the
global population are now below replacement level. Population growth
today is primarily driven by longer life spans and lower infant
mortality, not by rising fertility rates. Given current trends, it is
very possible that [the size of the human population will peak this
century and then **start to decline**.]{.underline} Trends in population
are inextricably linked to other demographic and economic dynamics. For
the first time in human history, over half the global population lives
in cities. By 2050, 70 percent are expected to dwell in cities, a number
that could rise to 80 percent or more by the century's end. Cities are
characterized by both dense populations and low fertility rates. Cities
occupy just 1 to 3 percent of the Earth's surface and yet are home to
nearly four billion people. As such, [cities both drive and symbolize
the decoupling of humanity from nature, performing far better than rural
economies in providing efficiently for material needs while reducing
environmental impacts]{.underline}. The growth of cities along with the
economic and ecological benefits that come with them are inseparable
from improvements in agricultural productivity. As agriculture has
become more land and labor efficient, rural populations have left the
countryside for the cities. Roughly half the US population worked the
land in 1880. Today, less than 2 percent does. As human lives have been
liberated from hard agricultural labor, enormous human resources have
been freed up for other endeavors. Cities, as people know them today,
could not exist without radical changes in farming. In contrast,
[[modernization is **not possible** in a **subsistence agrarian
economy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These improvements have resulted not
only in lower labor requirements per unit of agricultural output but
also in lower land requirements. This is not a new trend: [rising
harvest yields have for millennia reduced the amount of land required to
feed the average person. The average per-capita use of land today is
**vastly lower**]{.underline} than it was 5,000 years ago, despite the
fact that modern people enjoy a far richer diet. [Thanks to
**technological improvements** in agriculture]{.underline}, during the
half-century starting in the mid-1960s, [the amount of land required for
growing]{.underline} crops and animal feed for the average person
**[declined by one-half]{.underline}**. **[[Ag]{.mark}ricultural
intensification]{.underline}**, along with the move away from the use of
wood as fuel, [[has allowed]{.mark} many parts of the world to
experience **net [reforestation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. About 80 percent
of New England is today forested, compared with about 50 percent at the
end of the 19th century. Over the past 20 years, the amount of land
dedicated to production forest worldwide declined by 50 million
hectares, an area the size of France. The "forest transition" from net
deforestation to net reforestation seems to be as resilient a feature of
development as the demographic transition that reduces human birth rates
as poverty declines. [Human [use of]{.mark} many other [resources
is]{.mark} similarly **[peaking]{.mark}**. The amount of **water**
needed]{.underline} for the average diet [has **declined**]{.underline}
by nearly 25 percent over the past half-century. Nitrogen pollution
continues to cause eutrophication and large dead zones in places like
the Gulf of Mexico. While the total amount of **[nitrogen]{.underline}**
pollution is rising, the amount used per unit of production [has
**declined significantly**]{.underline} in developed nations. Indeed,
[[in **contradiction** to the]{.mark} often-expressed [fear of infinite
growth]{.mark} colliding with a finite planet, [demand]{.mark} for many
material goods **[may be saturating]{.mark}** as societies grow
wealthier]{.underline}. Meat consumption, for instance, has peaked in
many wealthy nations and has shifted away from beef toward protein
sources that are less land intensive. As demand for material goods is
met, developed economies see higher levels of spending directed to
materially less-intensive service and knowledge sectors, which account
for an increasing share of economic activity. This dynamic might be even
more pronounced in today's developing economies, which may benefit from
being late adopters of resource-efficient technologies. Taken together,
[these trends mean that [the]{.mark} total [human impact]{.mark} on the
environment]{.underline}, including land-use change, overexploitation,
and pollution, [[can]{.mark} **peak** and [**decline this century**.
By]{.mark} **understanding** and **[promoting these]{.mark} emergent
[processes]{.mark}**[, humans have the opportunity to]{.mark}
**re-wild** and **[re-green the Earth]{.mark}** --- even as developing
countries achieve modern living standards, and material poverty
ends.]{.underline} 3. The processes of decoupling described above
challenge the idea that early human societies lived more lightly on the
land than do modern societies. Insofar as past societies had less impact
upon the environment, it was because those societies supported vastly
smaller populations. In fact, [early]{.underline} human [populations
with much less advanced technologies had far larger individual land
footprints than societies have today]{.underline}. Consider that a
population of no more than one or two million North Americans hunted
most of the continent's large mammals into extinction in the late
Pleistocene, while burning and clearing forests across the continent in
the process. Extensive human transformations of the environment
continued throughout the Holocene period: as much as three-quarters of
all deforestation globally occurred before the Industrial Revolution.
The technologies that humankind's ancestors used to meet their needs
supported much lower living standards with much higher per-capita
impacts on the environment. Absent a massive human die-off, any
large-scale attempt at recoupling human societies to nature using these
technologies would result in an unmitigated ecological and human
disaster. [Ecosystems around the world are threatened today because
people over-rely on them]{.underline}: people who depend on firewood and
charcoal for fuel cut down and degrade forests; people who eat bush meat
for food hunt mammal species to local extirpation. Whether it's a local
indigenous community or a foreign corporation that benefits, [it is the
continued dependence of humans on natural environments that is the
problem for the conservation of nature.]{.underline} Conversely,
**[modern technologies]{.underline}**, by using natural ecosystem flows
and services more efficiently, [offer a **real chance** of **reducing
the totality of human impacts** on the biosphere]{.underline}. To
embrace these technologies is to find paths to a good Anthropocene. [The
modernization processes]{.underline} that have increasingly liberated
humanity from nature [are]{.underline}, of course, [double-edged, since
they have also degraded the natural environment]{.underline}. Fossil
fuels, mechanization and manufacturing, synthetic fertilizers and
pesticides, electrification and modern transportation and communication
technologies, have made larger human populations and greater consumption
possible in the first place. Had technologies not improved since the
Dark Ages, no doubt the human population would not have grown much
either. [It is also true that large, increasingly affluent urban
populations have placed greater demands upon ecosystems]{.underline} in
distant places ---- the extraction of natural resources has been
globalized. [But those same technologies have also made it possible for
people to secure food, shelter, heat, light, and mobility through means
that are vastly more resource- and land-efficient than at any previous
time in human history. Decoupling]{.underline} human well-being from the
destruction of nature [requires the **conscious acceleration** of
**emergent decoupling processes**]{.underline}. In some cases, the
objective is the development of technological substitutes. Reducing
deforestation and indoor air pollution requires the substitution of wood
and charcoal with modern energy. In other cases, [humanity's goal should
be to **use resources more productively**. For example, increasing
agricultural yields can reduce the conversion of forests and grasslands
to farms. Humans should seek to liberate the environment from the
economy. Urbanization, **agricultural intensification**, **nuclear
power**, **aquaculture**, and **desalination** are all processes with a
**demonstrated potential** to **reduce human demands** on the
environment]{.underline}, allowing more room for non-human species.
Suburbanization, low-yield farming, and many forms of renewable energy
production, in contrast, generally require more land and resources and
leave less room for nature. These patterns suggest that humans are as
likely to spare nature because it is not needed to meet their needs as
they are to spare it for explicit aesthetic and spiritual reasons. The
parts of the planet that people have not yet profoundly transformed have
mostly been spared because they have not yet found an economic use for
them --- mountains, deserts, boreal forests, and other "marginal" lands.
Decoupling raises the possibility that societies might achieve peak
human impact without intruding much further on relatively untouched
areas. Nature unused is nature spared. 4. Plentiful access to modern
energy is an essential prerequisite for human development and for
decoupling development from nature. The availability of inexpensive
energy allows poor people around the world to stop using forests for
fuel. It allows humans to grow more food on less land, thanks to
energy-heavy inputs such as fertilizer and tractors. Energy allows
humans to recycle waste water and desalinate sea water in order to spare
rivers and aquifers. It allows humans to cheaply recycle metal and
plastic rather than to mine and refine these minerals. Looking forward,
modern energy may allow the capture of carbon from the atmosphere to
reduce the accumulated carbon that drives global warming. However, for
at least the past three centuries, rising energy production globally has
been matched by rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
Nations have also been slowly decarbonizing --- that is, reducing the
carbon intensity of their economies --- over that same time period. But
they have not been doing so at a rate consistent with keeping cumulative
carbon emissions low enough to reliably stay below the international
target of less than 2 degrees Centigrade of global warming. Significant
climate mitigation, therefore, will require that humans rapidly
accelerate existing processes of decarbonization. There remains much
confusion, however, as to how this might be accomplished. In developing
countries, rising energy consumption is tightly correlated with rising
incomes and improving living standards. Although the use of many other
material resource inputs such as nitrogen, timber, and land are
beginning to peak, the centrality of energy in human development and its
many uses as a substitute for material and human resources suggest that
energy consumption will continue to rise through much if not all of the
21st century. For that reason, any conflict between climate mitigation
and the continuing development process through which billions of people
around the world are achieving modern living standards will continue to
be resolved resoundingly in favor of the latter. Climate change and
other global ecological challenges are not the most important immediate
concerns for the majority of the world\'s people. Nor should they be. A
new coal-fired power station in Bangladesh may bring air pollution and
rising carbon dioxide emissions but will also save lives. For millions
living without light and forced to burn dung to cook their food,
electricity and modern fuels, no matter the source, offer a pathway to a
better life, even as they also bring new environmental challenges.
Meaningful [[climate]{.mark} mitigation [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
fundamentally [[a **technological challenge**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By
this we mean that [[even **dramatic limits** to]{.mark} per capita
global [consumption would be **insufficient**]{.mark} to achieve
significant climate mitigation. [Absent **profound
tech**]{.mark}**nological [change]{.mark}** **[there is no credible path
to]{.mark} meaningful climate [mitigation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
advocates differ in the particular mix of technologies they favor, [we
are aware of no quantified climate mitigation scenario in which
technological change is not responsible for the vast majority of
emissions cuts.]{.underline} The specific technological paths that
people might take toward climate mitigation remain deeply contested.
Theoretical scenarios for climate mitigation typically reflect their
creators' technological preferences and analytical assumptions while all
too often failing to account for the cost, rate, and scale at which
low-carbon energy technologies can be deployed. The history of energy
transitions, however, suggests [that there have been consistent patterns
associated with the ways that societies move toward cleaner sources of
energy. Substituting higher-quality]{.underline} (i.e., less
carbon-intensive, higher-density) [fuels for lower-quality]{.underline}
(i.e., more carbon-intensive, lower-density) [ones is how virtually all
societies have decarbonized, and points the way toward accelerated
decarbonization in the future]{.underline}. Transitioning to a world
powered by zero-carbon energy sources will require energy technologies
that are power dense and capable of scaling to many tens of terawatts to
power a growing human economy. Most forms of renewable energy are,
unfortunately, incapable of doing so. The scale of land use and other
environmental impacts necessary to power the world on biofuels or many
other renewables are such that we doubt they provide a sound pathway to
a zero-carbon low-footprint future. High-efficiency solar cells produced
from earth-abundant materials are an exception and have the potential to
provide many tens of terawatts on a few percent of the Earth's surface.
Present-day solar technologies will require substantial innovation to
meet this standard and the development of cheap energy storage
technologies that are capable of dealing with highly variable energy
generation at large scales. Nuclear fission today represents the only
present-day zero-carbon technology with the demonstrated ability to meet
most, if not all, of the energy demands of a modern economy. However, a
variety of social, economic, and institutional challenges make
deployment of present-day nuclear technologies at scales necessary to
achieve significant climate mitigation unlikely. A new generation of
nuclear technologies that are safer and cheaper will likely be necessary
for nuclear energy to meet its full potential as a critical climate
mitigation technology. In the long run, next-generation
[solar]{.underline}, advanced nuclear fission, [and nuclear]{.underline}
fusion [represent the most plausible pathways]{.underline} toward the
joint goals of climate stabilization and radical decoupling of humans
from nature. If the history of energy transitions is any guide, however,
[that transition will take time. During that transition, other energy
technologies can provide important social and environmental
benefits]{.underline}. Hydroelectric dams, for example, may be a cheap
source of low-carbon power for poor nations even though their land and
water footprint is relatively large. Fossil fuels with carbon capture
and storage can likewise provide substantial environmental benefits over
current fossil or biomass energies. [The ethical and pragmatic path
toward a just and sustainable global energy economy requires that human
beings **transition as rapidly as possible** to energy sources that are
**cheap**, **clean**, **dense**, and **abundant**. Such a path will
require sustained public support for the development and deployment of
clean energy technologies]{.underline}, both within nations and between
them, though international collaboration and competition, and within a
broader framework for global modernization and development. 5. We write
this document out of deep love and emotional connection to the natural
world. By appreciating, exploring, seeking to understand, and
cultivating nature, many people get outside themselves. They connect
with their deep evolutionary history. Even when people never experience
these wild natures directly, they affirm their existence as important
for their psychological and spiritual well-being. [[Humans will
**always**]{.mark} **materially [depend on nature ]{.mark}**[to some
degree]{.mark}. Even if a fully synthetic world were possible, many of
us might still choose to continue to live more coupled with nature than
human sustenance and technologies require. What decoupling offers is the
possibility that humanity's material dependence upon nature might be
**less destructive**.]{.underline} The case for a more active,
conscious, and accelerated decoupling to spare nature draws more on
spiritual or aesthetic than on material or utilitarian arguments.
Current and future generations could survive and prosper materially on a
planet with much less biodiversity and wild nature. But this is not a
world we want nor, if humans embrace decoupling processes, need to
accept. What we are here calling nature, or even wild nature,
encompasses landscapes, seascapes, biomes and ecosystems that have, in
more cases than not, been regularly altered by human influences over
centuries and millennia. Conservation science, and the concepts of
biodiversity, complexity, and indigeneity are useful, but alone cannot
determine which landscapes to preserve, or how. In most cases, there is
no single baseline prior to human modification to which nature might be
returned. For example, efforts to restore landscapes to more closely
resemble earlier states ("indigeneity") may involve removing recently
arrived species ("invasives") and thus require a net reduction in local
biodiversity. In other circumstances, communities may decide to
sacrifice indigeneity for novelty and biodiversity. Explicit efforts to
preserve landscapes for their non-utilitarian value are inevitably
anthropogenic choices. For this reason, all conservation efforts are
fundamentally anthropogenic. The setting aside of wild nature is no less
a human choice, in service of human preferences, than bulldozing it.
Humans will save wild places and landscapes by convincing our fellow
citizens that these places, and the creatures that occupy them, are
worth protecting. People may choose to have some services --- like water
purification and flood protection --- provided for by natural systems,
such as forested watersheds, reefs, marshes, and wetlands, even if those
natural systems are more expensive than simply building water treatment
plants, seawalls, and levees. There will be no one-size-fits-all
solution. Environments will be shaped by different local, historical,
and cultural preferences. While we believe that agricultural
intensification for land-sparing is key to protecting wild nature, we
recognize that many communities will continue to opt for land-sharing,
seeking to conserve wildlife within agricultural landscapes, for
example, rather than allowing it to revert to wild nature in the form of
grasslands, scrub, and forests. Where decoupling reduces pressure on
landscapes and ecosystems to meet basic human needs, landowners,
communities, and governments still must decide to what aesthetic or
economic purpose they wish to dedicate those lands. Accelerated
decoupling alone will not be enough to ensure more wild nature. There
must still be a conservation politics and a wilderness movement to
demand more wild nature for aesthetic and spiritual reasons. Along with
decoupling humankind's material needs from nature, establishing an
enduring commitment to preserve wilderness, biodiversity, and a mosaic
of beautiful landscapes will require a deeper emotional connection to
them. 6. [We affirm the need and human capacity for **accelerated**,
**active**, and **conscious decoupling**. [Tech]{.mark}nological
progress [is **not inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Decoupling
environmental impacts from economic outputs is not simply a function of
market-driven innovation and efficient response to scarcity. [The long
arc of [human transformation of]{.mark} natural [environments]{.mark}
through technologies [began]{.mark} well [before]{.mark} there existed
anything resembling [a market]{.mark} or a price signal]{.underline}.
Thanks to rising demand, scarcity, inspiration, and serendipity, humans
have remade the world for millennia. Technological solutions to
environmental problems must also be considered within a broader social,
economic, and political context. We think it is counterproductive for
nations like Germany and Japan, and states like California, to shutter
nuclear power plants, recarbonize their energy sectors, and recouple
their economies to fossil fuels and biomass. However, such examples
underscore clearly that technological choices will not be determined by
remote international bodies but rather by national and local
institutions and cultures. [[Too often, modernization is
**conflated**]{.underline}]{.mark}, both by its defenders and critics,
[**[with capitalism]{.mark}**, corporate power, and laissez-faire
economic policies. We **reject such reductions**]{.underline}. What we
refer to when we speak of [[modernization is the]{.mark} **long-term
[evolution]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**social**, **economic**,
**political**, and **technological [arrangements]{.mark}** in human
societies]{.underline} toward vastly improved material well-being,
public health, resource productivity, economic integration, shared
infrastructure, and personal freedom. [Modernization has **liberated
ever more people** from lives of poverty]{.underline} and hard
agricultural labor, women from chattel status, children and ethnic
minorities from oppression, and societies from capricious and arbitrary
governance. [**Greater resource productivity** associated with **modern
socio-technological systems** has allowed human societies to **meet
human needs** with **fewer resource inputs** and **less impact** on the
environment. More-productive economies are wealthier
economies]{.underline}, capable of better meeting human needs while
committing more of their economic surplus to non-economic amenities,
including better human health, greater human freedom and opportunity,
arts, culture, and the conservation of nature. [[Modernizing processes
are **far from complete**]{.mark}, even in advanced developed economies.
Material consumption has only just begun to peak in the wealthiest
societies. [Decoupling]{.mark}]{.underline} of human welfare from
environmental impacts [[will require a **sustained commitment** to
**tech**]{.mark}**nological [progress]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
continuing evolution of social, economic, and political institutions
alongside those changes. Accelerated technological progress will require
the **[active]{.mark}**, **assertive**, and **aggressive
[participation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **private sector entrepreneurs**,
**[markets]{.mark}**, **civil society**, [and **the
state**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While we reject the planning fallacy of
the 1950s, [we continue to embrace a **strong public role**]{.underline}
[in **addressing environmental problems** and **accelerating
technological innovation**, including **research** to develop better
technologies, **subsidies**, and other measures to help **bring them to

innovation and technology transfer is essential in the areas of

energy consumption on CO2 emissions: A revisited Environmental Kuznets
Curve approach." *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews* 54(Feb):
838-9. Emory Libraries.

Some seminal papers reveal that, [within the process of economic growth,
environmental pollution level first scales up and later scales
down]{.underline}. This is [an inverted U-shaped relationship between
GDP]{.underline} per capita [and pollution level]{.underline} (Grossman
and Krueger \[3,4\], Panayotou \[5\], Shafik \[6\], Selden and Song
\[7\]). Since this relationship resembles the relationship between GDP
per capita and income inequality produced by Kuznets \[8\], Panayotou
\[5\] calls it Environmental [Kuznets Curve (EKC)]{.underline}.

According to the EKC hypothesis, [the level of environmental
pollution]{.underline} initially intensifies because of economic growth,
later [tampers after GDP per capita reaches a threshold
value]{.underline} (Panayotou \[5\], Suri and Chapman \[9\]; Stern
\[10\]). Therefore, this hypothesis implies a dynamic process in which
[structural change occurs together with economic growth]{.underline}
(Dinda \[2\]). Grossman and Krueger \[3\] first clarify how the EKC
arises. They explore that [economic growth affects environmental quality
through three channels:]{.underline} (i) [scale effect,]{.underline}
(ii) [structural effect, and]{.underline} (iii) [technological
effect]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents the EKC within the periods of (i),
(ii) and (iii).

According to the scale effect, given the level of technology, more
resources and inputs are employed to produce more commodities at the
beginning of economic growth path. Hence, more energy resources and
production will induce more waste and pollutant emissions, and the level
of environmental quality will get worse (Torras and Boyce \[11\], Dinda
\[2\], Prieur \[12\]). [The structural effect states that the economy
will have a structural transformation, and **economic [growth will
affect environment positively]{.mark}** along with continuation of
growth]{.underline}. In other words, [[as]{.mark} national [production
grows the]{.mark} structure of [economy changes]{.mark}]{.underline},
and [the share of [less polluting]{.mark} economic [activities
increases]{.mark} gradually]{.underline}. Besides, [an economy
experiences [a transition from capital-intensive]{.mark} industrial
sectors [to service sector]{.mark} and reaches technology-intensive
knowledge economy]{.underline} (the final stage of the structural
change). Due to the fact [[that]{.mark} technology-intensive sectors
[utilize fewer]{.mark} natural [sources]{.mark}, the impact of these
sectors on environmental pollution will be less]{.underline}. The last
channel of the growth process is the technological effect channel.
[Since a high-income economy can allocate more resources for
[r]{.mark}]{.underline}esearch [[and]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}]{.underline}evelopment [expenditures, the new technological
processes will emerge]{.underline}. Thus, [the country [will
**replace**]{.mark} **old and [dirty tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies
**[[with]{.mark} new and [clean tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies,
[and environmental quality will deepen]{.underline} (Borghesi \[13\],
Copelan and Taylor \[14\]). Consequently, [environmental
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline} initially increases and later
[[decreases as a result of scale]{.mark}, structural [and
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [[effect]{.mark} emerging along [with
growth]{.mark} path]{.underline}.

Some studies of EKC hypothesis consider income elasticity of clean
environment demand (Beckerman \[15\], Selden and Song \[16\], McConnel
\[17\], Panayotou \[18\], Carson et al. \[19\], Brock and Taylor
\[20\]). Accordingly, the share of low-income people's expenditures for
food and basic necessities is higher than that of high-income societies'
expenditures for the same type of commodities (Engel's Law). [[As income
level]{.mark} and life standards [rise]{.mark} in conjunction with
economic growth, the societies' [demand for clean environment
advances]{.mark}]{.underline}. Besides, [societies make often pressure
on policy makers to protect the environment through new
regulations]{.underline}. One might argue that, because of these
reasons, clean environment is a luxury commodity and the [demand
elasticity of clean environment is higher than unity]{.underline} (Dinda
\[2\]).

Institute (Richard, "The Anthropocene: It's Not All About Us",

[[It's **hard** to convince people to **voluntarily reduce
consumption**]{.underline}]{.mark} and curb reproduction. That's not
because humans are unusually pushy, greedy creatures; [[all]{.mark}
living [organisms tend to **maximize their**]{.mark} **population size**
and **[rate of]{.mark} collective [energy use]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Inject a colony of bacteria into a suitable growth medium in a petri
dish and watch what happens. Hummingbirds, mice, leopards, oarfish,
redwood trees, or giraffes: [in each instance **[the principle remains
inviolate]{.mark}**---every species maximizes population and energy
consumption within nature's limits]{.underline}. Systems ecologist
Howard T. Odum called this rule the Maximum Power Principle: throughout
nature, "system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake,
energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and
efficiency."

In addition to our innate propensity to maximize population and
consumption, [we humans also **have difficulty making sacrifices** in
the present in order to reduce future costs. [We're **genetically
hardwired** to respond to immediate threats]{.mark} with fight-or-flight
responses, while [distant hazards **matter much less**]{.mark} to
us]{.underline}. It's not that we don't think about the future at all;
rather, [we **unconsciously apply a discount rate** based on the amount
of time likely to elapse before a menace has to be faced]{.underline}.

True, there is some variation in future-anticipating behavior among
individual humans. [[A **small percentage**]{.mark} of the population
[may change behavior]{.mark} now to reduce risks to forthcoming
generations, while **[the great majority is less likely]{.mark} to do
so**. If that small percentage could oversee our collective future
planning, we might have]{.underline} much [less to worry about. But
**that's tough to arrange** in democracies]{.underline}, [where
people]{.underline}, politicians, corporations, and even nonprofit
organizations [get ahead by promising immediate rewards, usually in the
form of more economic growth. If none of these can organize a proactive
response]{.underline} to long-range threats like climate change, [[the
actions of **a few**]{.mark} **individuals** and communities **[may
not]{.mark} be so effective** at [mitigat]{.mark}ing [the
hazard]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} pessimistic expectation [is **borne out by

the]{.underline} 21st century ecological [[crisis have been **apparent
since the**]{.mark} **19[70s]{.mark}**. [Yet **not much has actually
been accomplished**]{.mark} through efforts to avert that crisis. It is
possible to point to hundreds, thousands, perhaps even millions of

at Bard College, 7/28, "The Energy Revolution 4: Hot Planet?"
<http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2012/07/28/the-energy-revolution-4-hot-planet/>

[[Capitalism is not]{.underline}]{.mark}, Monbiot is forced to admit, [a
[fragile]{.mark} system that will easily be replaced]{.underline}.
[Bolstered by huge supplies of oil, **[it is here to
stay]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Industrial civilization is]{.underline},
as far as he can now see, [unstoppable]{.underline}. Gaia, that
treacherous ~~slut~~, has made so much oil and gas that her faithful
acolytes today cannot protect her from the consequences of her own
folly.¶ Welcome to the New Green Doom: an overabundance of oil and gas
is going to release so much greenhouse gas that the world is going to
fry. The exploitation of the oil sands in Alberta, warn leading
environmentalists, is a tipping point. William McKibben put it this way
in an interview with Wired magazine in the fall of 2011:¶ I think if we
go whole-hog in the tar sands, we're out of luck. Especially since that
would doubtless mean we're going whole-hog at all the other
unconventional energy sources we can think of: Deepwater drilling,
fracking every rock on the face of the Earth, and so forth.¶ Here's why
the tar sands are important: It's a decision point about whether, now
that we're running out of the easy stuff, we're going to go after the
hard stuff. The Saudi Arabian liquor store is running out of bottles. Do
we sober up, or do we find another liquor store, full of really crappy
booze, to break into?¶ A year later, despite the success of
environmentalists like McKibben at persuading the Obama administration
to block a pipeline intended to ship this oil to refineries in the US,
it's clear (as it was crystal clear all along to anyone with eyes to
see) that the world has every intention of making use of the "crappy
liquor."¶ Again, for people who base their claim to world leadership on
their superior understanding of the dynamics of complex systems,
[[greens]{.mark} prove over and over again that they [are]{.mark}
surprisingly [naive]{.mark} and crude [in]{.mark} their [ability]{.mark}
to model and [to **shape**]{.mark} **the behavior of the political and
[economic systems]{.mark}** they seek to control]{.underline}. If their
understanding of the future of the earth's climate is anything like as
wish-driven, fact-averse and intellectually crude as their approach to
international affairs, democratic politics and the energy market, the
greens are in trouble indeed. And as I've written in the past, the
contrast between green claims to understand climate and to be able to
manage the largest and most complex set of policy changes ever
undertaken, and the evident incompetence of greens at managing small
(Solyndra) and large (Kyoto, EU cap and trade, global climate treaty)
political projects today has more to do with climate skepticism than
greens have yet understood. Many people aren't rejecting science; they
are rejecting green claims of policy competence. In doing so, they are
entirely justified by the record.¶ Nevertheless, the future of the
environment is not nearly as dim as greens think. Despairing
environmentalists like McKibben and Monbiot are as wrong about what the
new era of abundance means as green energy analysts were about how much
oil the planet had.¶ The problem is the original sin of much
environmental thought: Malthusianism. If greens weren't so addicted to
Malthusian horror narratives they would be able to see that the new era
of abundance is going to make this a cleaner planet faster than if the
new gas and oil had never been found.¶ Let's be honest. It has long been
clear to students of history, and has more recently begun to dawn on
many environmentalists, that all that happy-clappy carbon treaty stuff
was a pipe dream and that nothing like that is going to happen. A
humanity that hasn't been able to ban the bomb despite the clear and
present dangers that nuclear weapons pose isn't going to ban or even
seriously restrict the internal combustion engine and the generator.¶
The political efforts of the green movement to limit greenhouse gasses
have had very little effect so far, and it is highly unlikely that they
will have more success in the future. [The green movement has been more
of a group hug than a curve bending exercise]{.underline}, and that is
unlikely to change. If the climate curve bends, it will bend the way the
population curve did: as the result of lots of small human decisions
driven by short term interest calculations rather than as the result of
a grand global plan.¶ [The shale boom hasn't turned green success into
green failure. It's prevented green failure from turning into something
much worse]{.underline}. Monbiot understands this better than McKibben;
there was never any real doubt that we'd keep going to the liquor store.
If we hadn't found ways to use all this oil and gas, we wouldn't have
embraced the economics of less. True, as oil and gas prices rose, there
would be more room for wind and solar power, but the real winner of an
oil and gas shortage is... coal. To use McKibben's metaphor, there is a
much dirtier liquor store just down the road from the shale emporium,
and it's one we've been patronizing for centuries. The US and China have
oodles of coal, and rather than walk to work from our cold and dark
houses all winter, we'd use it. Furthermore, when and if the oil runs
out, the technology exists to get liquid fuel out of coal. It isn't
cheap and it isn't clean, but it works.¶ The newly bright oil and gas
future means that we aren't entering a new Age of Coal. For this, every
green on the planet should give thanks.¶ The second reason why greens
should give thanks for shale is that [[environmentalism is a
**luxury**]{.mark} good]{.underline}. People must survive and they will
survive by any means necessary. But they would much rather thrive than
merely survive, and if they can arrange matters better, they will. [[A
poor society]{.mark} near the edge of survival [will **dump**]{.mark}
**the industrial [waste]{.mark} in the river** without a second thought.
[It will **burn coal**]{.mark} and choke in the resulting smog if it has
nothing else to burn.]{.underline}¶ [Politics in an age of survival is
ugly and practical]{.underline}. It has to be. The best leader is the
one who can cut out all the fluff and the folderol and keep you alive
through the winter. [During the Battle of Leningrad, people burned
priceless antiques to stay alive for just one more night.]{.underline}¶
[[An age of]{.mark} energy [shortages]{.mark} and high prices
[translates into]{.mark} an age of **radical [food]{.mark} and economic
[insecurity for billions]{.mark}** of people. [Those
**billions**]{.mark} **of hungry, frightened, angry people won't fold
their hands and meditate**]{.underline} on the ineffable wonders of Gaia
and her mystic web of life [as they pass peacefully away.]{.underline}
Nor will they vote George Monbiot and Bill McKibben into power. [They
[will]{.mark} **butcher every panda in the zoo** before they see their
children starve, they will **[torch every forest]{.mark} on earth**
[before they freeze to death]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the cheaper and
the meaner their lives are, the less energy or thought they will spare
to the perishing world around them.¶ But, thanks to shale and other
unconventional energy sources, that isn't where we are headed. [We are
heading into a world in which energy is abundant and horizons are open
even as humanity's grasp of science and technology grows more secure. A
world where more and more basic human needs are met is a world that
**has time to think about other goals and the money to spend on them**.
As China gets richer, the Chinese want cleaner air, cleaner water, purer
food --- and they are ready and able to pay for them]{.underline}. A
[Brazil whose economic future is secure can afford to treasure and
conserve its rain forests]{.underline}. A Central America where the
people are doing all right is more willing and able to preserve its
biodiversity. [And [a world in which people know where their next meal
is coming from is a world that]{.mark} can and [will take thought
for]{.mark} things like the **[sustainability]{.mark} of the fisheries**
and the **protection of the coral reefs**.¶]{.underline} A world that is
more relaxed about the security of its energy sources is going to be
able to do more about improving the quality of those sources and about
managing the impact of its energy consumption on the global commons. [[A
rich]{.mark}, energy secure [world is going to spend]{.mark} more [money
developing **solar**]{.mark} power **[and wind]{.mark}** power and other
sustainable sources than a poor, hardscrabble one.¶]{.underline} When
human beings think their basic problems are solved, they start looking
for more elegant solutions. [Once Americans had an industrial and modern
economy, we **started wanting to clean up the rivers and the air**. Once
people aren't worried about getting enough calories every day to
survive, they start **wanting healthier food**]{.underline} more
elegantly prepared.¶ A world of abundant shale oil and gas is a world
that will start imposing more environmental regulations on shale and gas
producers. [A prosperous world will set money aside for research and
development for new technologies that conserve energy or find it in
cleaner surroundings]{.underline}. [[A prosperous world facing climate
change will]{.mark} be able to **[ameliorate the consequences]{.mark}**
and take thought for the future [in ways that a world overwhelmed
by]{.mark} energy insecurity and **gripped in a permanent [economic
crisis]{.mark} of scarcity simply [can't and won't]{.mark}
do**.]{.underline}¶ Greens should also be glad that the new energy is
where it is. For Monbiot and for many others, Gaia's decision to put so
much oil into the United States and Canada seems like her biggest
indiscretion of all. Certainly, a United States of America that has, in
the Biblical phrase, renewed its youth like an eagle with a large
infusion of fresh petro-wealth is going to be even less eager than
formerly to sign onto various pie-in-the-sky green carbon treaties.¶ But
think how much worse things would be if the new reserves lay in
dictatorial kleptocracies. How willing and able would various Central
Asia states have been to regulate extraction and limit the damage? How
would Nigeria have handled vast new reserves whose extraction required
substantially more invasive methods?¶ Instead, [the new sources are
concentrated in places where environmentalists have more say in policy
making and where, for all the shortcomings and limits, governments are
less corruptible, more publicly accountable and in fact more competent
to develop and enforce effective energy regulations.]{.underline} This
won't satisfy McKibben and Monbiot (nothing that could actually happen
would satisfy either of these gentlemen), but it is a lot better than
what we could be facing.¶ Additionally, if there are two countries in
the world that should worry carbon-focused greens more than any other,
they are the United States and China. The two largest, hungriest
economies in the world are also home to enormous coal reserves. But
based on what we now know, the US and China are among the biggest
beneficiaries of the new cornucopia. Gaia put the oil and the gas where,
from a carbon point of view, it will do the most good. [In a world of
energy shortages and insecurity, both the US and China would have **gone
flat out for coal**]{.underline}. Now, that is much less likely.¶ And
there's one more reason why greens should thank Gaia for shale. Wind and
solar aren't ready for prime time now, but by the time the new sources
start to run low, humanity will have mastered many more technologies
that can used to provide energy and to conserve it. It's likely that Age
of Shale hasn't just postponed the return of coal: because of this extra
time, there likely will never be another age in which coal is the
dominant industrial fuel. It's virtually certain that the total lifetime
carbon footprint of the human race is going to be smaller with the new
oil and gas sources than it would have been without them.¶ Neither the
world's energy problems nor its climate issues are going away any time
soon. Paradise is not beckoning just a few easy steps away. But the new
availability of these energy sources is on balance a positive thing for
environmentalists as much as for anyone else.¶ Perhaps, and I know this
is a heretical thought, but perhaps Gaia is smarter than the greens.

### Transition = War\-\--ALEXANDER

#### Alexander says more recently transition causes war

**Alexander 16**---Lecturer and research fellow at the University of
Melbourne, co-director of the Simplicity Institute, and a PhD \[Samuel,
"Policies for a Post-Growth Economy," Issues Paper No. 6 April 2016, p.
11, <http://tinyurl.com/zq3vjn5>\]

Hard Truths about a 'Top-Down' Transition I wish to conclude by
acknowledging several hard truths about the feasibility of a 'top down'
transition to a post-growth economy. The first is to note that cultures
around the world, especially in the developed world, are not close to
being ready to take the idea of a post-growth economy seriously. In
Australia, for example, our current and prospective [[governments are
all firmly embedded in the growth paradigm and]{.mark} they [show no
signs of questioning it]{.mark} -- none at all. At the [cultural]{.mark}
level, the [expectation of ever-increasing affluence]{.mark} (which
assumes continued growth) [is as strong as ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this political and cultural context, the [policy proposals]{.underline}
outlined above -- [however necessary they might be to [confronting the
limits to growth]{.mark} predicament -- [will strike]{.mark} most
[people as wildly unrealistic]{.mark}, overly interventionist[,
and]{.mark} probably [undesirabl]{.mark}e]{.underline}. I am not so
deluded as to think otherwise. The second point to note, subtly linked
to the first, is that [[the powers-that-be would not tolerate]{.mark}
these policies for [a post-growth economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
provide a case in point,[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} a relatively fringe
[[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark} Movement in 2011 [[began to
challenge]{.mark} undue [corporate influence]{.mark} on democracy
a]{.underline}nd make noise about wealth inequality, [soon enough
[the]{.mark} executive branches of [government]{.mark} bore down upon
the activists and [stamped out]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}.
Mainstream media made little effort to understand the movement. [Given
that a postgrowth economy would directly undermine the economic
interests of the most powerful corporations and institutions in society,
one should expect merciless and sustained resistance]{.mark} from these
vested interests if a post-growth movement ever began gaining
ascendency.]{.underline} The third point to note -- and probably the
most challenging -- is that, [in a globalised world order, even the bold
policies]{.underline} proposed above [would be unlikely to produce a
stable and flourishing post-growth economy]{.underline}. After all, [how
would the stock markets react]{.underline} if a government announced a
policy agenda that would deliberately aim to contract the economy for
environmental and social justice reasons? More specifically, how would
the stock markets react if a government, in pursuit of sustainability
and global equity, introduced a diminishing resource cap that sought to
phase out the most damaging industries and reduce resource consumption
by 80% of current Australian levels? I suspect [[there would be utter
turmoil]{.underline}]{.mark}, ultimately [[leading to an economic crash
far greater than the global financial crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} My
point is that [[it]{.underline} [may well be impossible to implement
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [smooth '[top down' transition]{.mark} to a
post-growth economy, [even if a strong]{.mark} social [movement
developed]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that wanted this. The market
economies we know today would be unlikely to be able to adjust to the
types and speed of foundational changes required. A 'great disruption'
of some form may be a necessary or inevitable part of the transition
beyond growth. [To make matters more challenging still, in a globalised
economy, [it is not clear]{.mark} whether a [single nation could adopt a
post-growth economy without inducing]{.mark} a range of [antagonistic
reactions from other nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[there is a web of [international 'free trade' agreements]{.mark} that
[make such a move highly problematic, and could]{.mark} even [provoke
sanctions]{.mark} from international institutions or other
governments]{.underline}. On the other hand, in a globalised
[economythere is always the threat of capital flight the moment a
government threatens to defy the neoliberal logic of profit-maximisation
or talks of wealth redistribution. There is also the [geopolitical
risk]{.mark} of being a leader in a post-growth transition, as this [may
involve fewer funds ]{.mark}available [for military
forces]{.mark},weakening a nation's relative power globally. All
of these issues radically call into question the feasibility of a 'top
down' transition to a post-growth economy, and yet these challenges are
rarely acknowledged in the post-growth literature]{.underline}.

You may have noticed that the organic section of your local supermarket
is growing. Advocates tout organic-food production---in everything from
milk and coffee to meat and vegetables---as a \"sustainable\" way to
feed the planet\'s expanding population. The
**[Worldwatch]{.underline}** Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based
environmental group, **[goes so far as to say organic farming \"has the
potential to contribute to sustainable food security]{.underline}** by
improving nutrition intake and sustaining livelihoods in rural areas,
**[while]{.underline}** simultaneously **[reducing vulnerability to
climate change and enhancing biodiversity]{.underline}**.\" The
**[evidence argues otherwise]{.underline}**. A study by the Institute
for Water Research at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, published last
year in the journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, found that
\"intensive **[organic ag]{.underline}**riculture relying on solid
organic matter, such as composted manure that is implemented in the soil
prior to planting as the sole fertilizer, **[resulted in significant
down-leaching of nitrate\" into groundwater]{.underline}**. With many of
the world\'s most fertile farming regions in the throes of drought,
increased nitrate in groundwater is hardly a hallmark of sustainability.
Moreover, as agricultural scientist Steve Savage has documented on the
Sustainablog website, wide-scale composting generates significant
amounts of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Compost
may also deposit pathogenic bacteria on or in food crops, which has led
to more frequent occurrences of food poisoning in the U.S. and
elsewhere. **[[Organic]{.mark} farming [might work]{.mark} well
[for]{.mark} certain [local environments]{.mark} on a small scale, [but
its farms produce far less food]{.mark} per unit of land and water [than
conventional ones]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The low yields of organic
ag]{.underline}**riculture---**[[typically]{.mark} 20%-[50%]{.mark} less
than conventional ag]{.underline}**riculture---impose various stresses
on farmland and especially on water consumption. A British meta-analysis
published in the Journal of Environmental Management (2012) found that
\"**[[ammonia]{.mark} emissions, [nitrogen leaching and nitrous
oxide]{.mark} emissions per product unit [were higher]{.mark} from
organic systems\" [than conventional farming]{.mark} systems, as were
\"land use, eutrophication potential and acidification]{.underline}**
potential per product unit.\" **[[Lower crop yields are inevitable given
organic]{.mark} farming[\'s]{.mark} [systematic rejection of]{.mark}
many [advanced]{.mark} methods and [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies.
**[If the scale of [organic production]{.mark} were significantly
[increased]{.mark}, the lower yields would increase the [pressure
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[conversion of]{.mark} more
[land]{.mark} to farming [and more water]{.mark} for
irrigation,]{.underline}** both of which are **[[serious environmental
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Another limitation of [organic
production]{.mark} is that it [disfavors]{.mark} the best approach to

quality]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[namely]{.underline}**, the
**[minimization of soil disturbances such as [tilling]{.mark}, [combined
with]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}the use of **[[cover
crops]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Both approaches help to limit soil
erosion and the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides]{.underline}**.
**[Organic growers]{.underline}** do frequently plant cover crops, but
**[in the absence of effective herbicides]{.underline}**, often they
**[rely on tillage]{.underline}** (or even labor-intensive hand weeding)
**[for weed control]{.underline}**. One **[prevalent myth
is]{.underline}** that **[organic ag]{.underline}**riculture **[does not
employ pesticides. [Organic farming]{.mark} does [use]{.mark}
insecticides and fungicides to prevent predation of its crops. More than
20 chemicals]{.underline}** (mostly containing copper and sulfur) **[are

### Degrowth ≠ Solve Warming

Okay. Thanks again for having me on. I want to say, first of all, that I
certainly share a lot of the concerns that Peter and many other
proponents of degrowth, or variations thereof, have with respect, first
of all, to using GDP as a measure of welfare, thinking that GDP is the
be-all, end-all, that economies have to grow to make living standards
better. I share all of those concerns. I want to focus strictly on the
issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, CO2
emissions, which constitute about 80 percent of greenhouse gas
emissions. And my point is very straightforward. We have to[, [if we
take even the conservative assumptions of the]{.mark} Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the [IPCC]{.mark}, [we have to reduce
emissions]{.mark} somewhere in the range of [40 percent within 20
years]{.mark}]{.underline}, [80 percent by 2050,]{.underline} 35 years,
[and certainly by the end of this century eliminate CO2 emissions from
energy altogether.]{.underline} In order to do that, **[[we simply can't
get close to that goal by reducing GDP]{.mark} alone. GDP reduction,
[degrowth, is not a solution to climate stabilization]{.mark}. [What we
have to do]{.mark} instead [is invest massively in clean
tech]{.mark}nologies, renewable energy, and in high energy efficiency.
[That]{.mark} in my view [is the only way]{.mark}, [even if you're a
proponent of degrowth]{.mark} for other reasons, [it is simply not a
solution]{.mark} in terms of climate stabilization]{.underline}**.

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [[over]{.mark}
earth\'s [history there have been]{.mark} **[distinct warm
periods]{.mark}** with temperatures **[exceeding]{.mark} the [current
ones]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre and
McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing the relevant
scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the
[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} (1975--2000) [[increase]{.mark} in the
earth\'s mean temperature [does not appear]{.mark} to be **unusual** or
**[unprecedented]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC and many
supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p. 1568).
Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The [IPCC warns
that climate change]{.mark} is likely [to have severe
consequences]{.mark}, particularly for poor countries, such as increased
hunger, water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and
debilitating diseases. **[However]{.mark}**, these [estimations have
been]{.mark} **[heavily criticized]{.mark}** [for failing to]{.mark}
properly [account for]{.mark} **substantial improvements in [adaptive
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the
impact of global warming) [that are likely to occur due to advances in
**economic development**, **technological change** and **human capital**
over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany, 2007). [Fostering economic
growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use
of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will strengthen both industrialized and
developing countries\' **adaptive capacity** to deal not just with
possible future climate change consequences, but also with other
environmental and public health problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will
**provide greater benefits** at lower costs than drastic climate change
mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Goklany, 2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore,
the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current
state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission
reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially
in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize
atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous
advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing
(Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, [**even if** every
industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets set by
the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [such efforts are likely to have
**little effect**]{.underline}, [particularly in the light of the
considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by rising economic
superpowers as **China** and **India**, as well as the **remaining
developing world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized
us for choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural processes
potentially affect climate in specific locations and times." Yet the
purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by
the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent
extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are the
consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Moreover,
data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme
weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average annual death
and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%,
respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and
technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase
globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC\'s
exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an
op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol
(2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading
authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its over alarmist
assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity\'s
adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[[Humans are]{.mark} a
**[tough]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[adaptable]{.mark}**
species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in
the desert and in the rainforest. [**[We survived ice ages]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[primitive
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The idea that climate change poses
an existential threat to humankind is]{.underline}
**[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

[[Global]{.mark} mean surface [temperature]{.mark} over the past 20
years]{.underline} (1993--2012) [[rose]{.mark} at a rate of
0.14]{.underline} ± 0.06 [°C per decade]{.underline} (95% confidence
interval)1. [This rate of warming is **[significantly slower than that
simulated]{.mark} by**]{.underline} the climate **[models]{.underline}**
participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP5). To illustrate this, [[we considered trends]{.mark} in global
mean surface temperature computed [from **117 simulations**]{.mark} of
the climate]{.underline} by 37 CMIP5 models (see Supplementary
Information). [These models generally simulate natural
variability]{.underline} --- including that associated with the El
Niño--Southern Oscillation and explosive volcanic eruptions --- [as well
as estimate the combined response of climate to changes in greenhouse
gas concentrations, aerosol abundance]{.underline} (of sulphate, black
carbon and organic carbon, for example), [ozone
concentrations]{.underline} (tropospheric and stratospheric), [land
use]{.underline} (for example, deforestation) [and solar variability. By
averaging simulated temperatures]{.underline} only at locations where
corresponding observations exist, [[we find an average]{.mark} simulated
[rise in]{.mark} global mean surface temperature of 0.30]{.underline} ±
0.02 [°C per decade]{.underline} (using 95% confidence intervals on the
model average). [The observed rate]{.underline} of warming given above
[is **[less than half of this]{.mark} simulated [rate]{.mark}**, and
only a few simulations provide]{.underline} warming [trends within the
range of observational uncertainty]{.underline} (Fig. 1a). The
[[inconsistency]{.underline}]{.mark} between observed and simulated
global warming [[is even more striking]{.mark} for temperature
trends]{.underline} computed [[over the past fifteen
years]{.underline}]{.mark} (1998--2012). For this period, [the observed
trend of 0.05]{.underline} ± 0.08 [°C per decade is more than four times
smaller than the]{.underline} average [simulated trend]{.underline} of
0.21 ± 0.03 °C per decade (Fig. 1b). It is worth noting that [the
[observed trend]{.mark}]{.underline} over this period --- not
significantly different from zero --- [[suggests a]{.mark} temporary
**['hiatus' in]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}**]{.underline} 2--4. The
divergence between observed and CMIP5- simulated global warming begins
in the early 1990s, as can be seen when comparing observed and simulated
running trends from 1970--2012 (Fig. 2a and 2b for 20-year and 15-year
running trends, respectively). The [evidence]{.underline}, therefore,
[indicates that the current generation of [climate
models]{.mark}]{.underline} (when run as a group, with the CMIP5
prescribed forcings) [[do not reproduce]{.mark} the [observed]{.mark}
global [warming over the past 20 years,]{.mark} or the slowdown in
global warming over the past fifteen years.]{.underline} This
[[interpretation is **supported by statistical
tests**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the null hypothesis that the observed
and model mean trends are equal, assuming that either: (1) the models
are exchangeable with each other (that is, the 'truth plus error' view);
or (2) the models are exchangeable with each other and with the
observations (see Supplementary Information). Differences between
observed and simulated 20-year trends have p values (Supplementary
Information) that drop to close to zero by 1993--2012 under assumption
(1) and to 0.04 under assumption (2) (Fig. 2c). Here we note that the
smaller the p value is, the stronger the evidence against the null
hypothesis. On this basis, the rarity of the 1993--2012 trend difference
under assumption (1) is obvious. Under assumption (2), this implies that
such an inconsistency is only expected to occur by chance once in 500
years, if 20-year periods are considered statistically independent.
Similar results apply to trends for 1998--2012 (Fig. 2d). In conclusion,
we reject the null hypothesis that the observed and model mean trends
are equal at the 10% level. [One possible explanation]{.underline} for
the discrepancy [is that forced and internal variation might combine
differently in observations than in models.]{.underline} For example,
the **[forced trends in models are modulated]{.underline}** up and down
[by simulated]{.underline} sequences of ENSO [events]{.underline}, which
are **[not expected to coincide with]{.underline}** the **[observed
sequence]{.underline}** of such events. [For this reason the moderating
influence]{.underline} on global warming [that arises from the decay
of]{.underline} the 1998 [El Niño]{.underline} event [does not occur
in]{.underline} the [models]{.underline} at that time. Thus [we
employ]{.underline} here [an established technique to]{.underline}
estimate the impact of ENSO on global mean temperature, and to
[incorporate the effects of]{.underline} dynamically induced atmospheric
[variability and]{.underline} major explosive [volcanic
eruptions]{.underline} 5,6. [Although]{.underline} these three natural
[variations account for some differences]{.underline} between simulated
and observed global warming, these [[differences do not]{.mark}
substantively [change]{.mark} our [conclusion that **observed and
simulated** ]{.mark}**global [warming are not in agreement]{.mark}**
over the past two decades]{.underline} (Fig. 3). [Another
source]{.underline} of internal climate variability that may contribute
to the inconsistency [is the]{.underline} Atlantic multidecadal
oscillation7 ([AMO]{.underline}). [However]{.underline}, this is
difficult to assess as the observed and simulated variations in global
temperature that are associated with the AMO seem to be dominated by a
large and concurrent signal of presumed anthropogenic origin
(Supplementary Fig. S1). It is worth noting that in any case [the AMO
has not driven cooling over the past 20 years.]{.underline} Another
possible driver of the difference between observed and simulated global
warming is increasing stratospheric aerosol concentrations. [Results
from several independent datasets show that stratospheric **aerosol
abundance has increased**]{.underline} since the late 1990s, owing to a
series of comparatively small tropical volcanic eruptions8 . [Although
none of the]{.underline} CMIP5 [simulations take this into account, two
independent sets of]{.underline} model [simulations estimate that
increasing stratospheric aerosols have had a]{.underline} surface
[cooling impact of]{.underline} about **[0.07 °C per
decade]{.underline}** since 1998,9. If the CMIP5 models had accounted
for increasing stratospheric aerosol, and had responded with the same
surface cooling impact, the simulations and observations would be in
closer agreement. [[Other factors that contribute
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[discrepancy could include a]{.mark}
missing **[decrease in]{.mark} stratospheric [water
vapour]{.mark}**]{.underline}[10]{.mark} (whose processes are not well
represented in current climate models), **[[errors in aerosol]{.mark}
forcing]{.underline}** in the CMIP5 models, [[a **bias in
the**]{.underline}]{.mark} prescribed [**solar [irradiance]{.mark}
trend**, [the possibility that]{.mark}]{.underline} the [transient
[climate sensitivity]{.mark}]{.underline} of the CMIP5 models [[could
be]{.underline}]{.mark} on average [too high]{.underline} 11,12 [or [a
**possible unusual episode**]{.mark}]{.underline} of internal climate
variability [not considered above]{.underline} 13,14. Ultimately the
causes of this inconsistency will only be understood after careful
comparison of simulated internal climate variability and climate model
forcings with observations from the past two decades, and by waiting to
see how global temperature responds over the coming decades.

Barry Brook¶ We argue that [at the [global]{.mark}-scale, ecological
["tipping points"]{.mark} and threshold-like "planetary boundaries" [are
improbable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, [shifts in the]{.mark} Earth's
[biosphere follow **[a gradual, smooth pattern]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
This means that it might be impossible to define scientifically
specific, critical levels of biodiversity loss or land-use change. This
has important consequences for both science and policy.¶ Humans are
causing changes in ecosystems across Earth to such a degree that there
is now broad agreement that we live in an epoch of our own making: the
Anthropocene. But the question of just how these changes will play out
--- and especially whether we might be approaching a planetary tipping
point with abrupt, global-scale consequences --- has remained
unsettled.¶ A tipping point occurs when an ecosystem attribute, such as
species abundance or carbon sequestration, responds abruptly and
possibly irreversibly to a human pressure, such as land-use or climate
change. Many local- and regional-level ecosystems, such as lakes,forests
and grasslands, behave this way. Recently however, [there have been
several efforts to define ecological tipping points at the global
scale]{.underline}.¶ [At a local scale, there are definitely warning
signs that an ecosystem is about to "tip"]{.underline}. For the
terrestrial biosphere, tipping points might be expected if ecosystems
across Earth respond in similar ways to human pressures and these
pressures are uniform, or if there are strong connections between
continents that allow for rapid diffusion of impacts across the planet.¶
[These criteria are, however, unlikely to be met in the real
world]{.underline}.¶ [First, [**ecosystems on different continents are
not strongly connected**. Organisms are limited in]{.mark} their
[movement by oceans and mountain ranges]{.mark}, as well as by climatic
factors]{.underline}, and while ecosystem change in one region can
affect the global circulation of, for example, greenhouse gases, [this
signal is likely to be weak in comparison with inputs from fossil fuel
combustion and deforestation]{.underline}.¶ [Second, the [responses of
ecosystems to human pressures]{.mark} like climate change or land-use
change depend on local circumstances and will therefore [differ between
locations]{.mark}]{.underline}. From a planetary perspective, [this
[diversity in ecosystem responses creates a]{.mark}n essentially
[gradual]{.mark} pattern of [change,
]{.mark}]{.underline}[without]{.mark} any identifiable [tipping
points]{.mark}.¶ This puts into question attempts to define critical
levels of land-use change or biodiversity loss scientifically.¶ Why does
this matter? Well, one concern we have is that [an undue focus on
planetary tipping points may distract from the vast ecological
transformations that have already occurred]{.underline}.¶ After all, as
much as four-fifths of the biosphere is today characterised by
ecosystems that locally, over the span of centuries and millennia, have
undergone human-driven regime shifts of one or more kinds.¶ Recognising
this reality and seeking appropriate conservation efforts at local and
regional levels might be a more fruitful way forward for ecology and
global change science.¶ Corey Bradshaw¶ (see also notes published here
on ConservationBytes.com)¶ Let's not get too distracted by the title of
the this article -- Does the terrestrial biosphere have planetary
tipping points? -- or the potential for a false controversy. It's
important to be clear that the planet is indeed ill, and it's largely
due to us. Species are going extinct faster than they would have
otherwise. The planet's climate system is being severely disrupted; so
is the carbon cycle. Ecosystem services are on the decline.¶ But -- and
it's a big "but" -- we have to be wary of claiming the end of the world
as we know it, or people will shut down and continue blindly with their
growth and consumption obsession. We as scientists also have to be
extremely careful not to pull concepts and numbers out of thin air
without empirical support.¶ Specifically, I'm referring to [[the latest
"craze" in]{.mark} environmental science writing -- [the idea of
"planetary tipping points"]{.mark} and the related "planetary
boundaries".]{.underline}¶ [It's]{.mark} really [the stuff of Hollywood
disaster blockbusters]{.mark} -- the world suddenly shifts into a new
"state" where some major aspect of how the world functions does an
immediate about-face.¶ Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of localised
examples of such tipping points, often characterised by something we
call "hysteresis". Brook defines hysterisis as:¶ a situation where the
current state of an ecosystem is dependent not only on its environment
but also on its history, with the return path to the original state
being very different from the original development that led to the
altered state. Also, at some range of the driver, there can exist two or
more alternative states¶ and "tipping point" as:¶ the critical point at
which strong nonlinearities appear in the relationship between ecosystem
attributes and drivers; once a tipping point threshold is crossed, the
change to a new state is typically rapid and might be irreversible or
exhibit hysteresis.¶ Some of these examples include state shifts that
have happened (or mostly likely will) to the cryosphere, ocean
thermohaline circulation, atmospheric circulation, and marine
ecosystems, and there are many other fine-scale examples of ecological
systems shifting to new (apparently) stable states.¶ However,
[[claiming]{.mark} that [we are approaching a]{.mark} major [planetary
boundary]{.mark} for our ecosystems]{.underline} (including human
society), where we witness such transitions simultaneously across the
globe, [is]{.mark} simply [not upheld by evidence.]{.mark}¶
[[Regional]{.mark} tipping [points are unlikely to translate]{.mark}
into [planet-wide]{.mark} state shifts. The main reason is
that]{.underline} our [ecosystems aren't]{.mark} that [connected at
global scales]{.mark}.¶ The paper provides a framework against which one
can test the existence or probability of a planetary tipping point for
any particular ecosystem function or state. To date, the application of
the idea has floundered because of a lack of specified criteria that
would allow the terrestrial biosphere to "tip". From a more sociological
viewpoint, the claim of imminent shift to some worse state also risks
alienating people from addressing the real problems (foxes), or as Brook
and colleagues summarise:¶ framing global change in the dichotomous
terms implied by the notion of a global tipping point could lead to
complacency on the "safe" side of the point and fatalism about
catastrophic or irrevocable effects on the other.¶ In other words, let's
be empirical about these sorts of politically charged statements instead
of crying "Wolf!" while the hordes of foxes steal most of the flock.

impact most ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even under the assumption
that all deposited sulfate will be in the form of sulfuric
acid]{.underline}. However, although these model results are feasible,
should geoengineering with sulfate aerosols actually be conducted, local
results due to weather variability may differ from the results presented
here. With the exception of terrestrial waterways, [[every region has a
critical loading value a full order of magnitude above the largest
potential total amount of acid deposition]{.mark} that would occur under
the geoengineering scenarios presented in this paper]{.underline}.
[Furthermore]{.underline}, our results show that [additional sulfate
[deposition tends to]{.mark} preferentially [occur over oceans]{.mark},
meaning [the chance of such a sensitive ecosystem receiving
enough]{.mark} additional sulfate [deposition to suffer negative
consequences is very small]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT: Nitrogen/Fertilizer

#### Zero risk of fertilizer crisis---nitrogen and potassium will last for 700 years

Food production is crucially dependent on three resources soil, water
and fertilizer. The [essential fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium, and until the last century these were mainly provided by
manure]{.underline}. Today, [about 6 percent of our raw material
expenditure is used on nitrogen]{.underline}. Nitrogen is absolutely
essential for food production, since it is an integral part of the
chlorophyll mole- cule, making plants green and enabling them to
transform sunlight to starch through photosynthesis. But today
[[nitrogen is]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[exclusively synthesized from
air, and since air contains]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[78 percent
nitrogen there are no limits to consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}. 1034
Phosphorus is a constituent of DNA and con- sequently indispensable for
all forms of life. Often, the amount of phosphorus available sets the
limit of biological activity in natural sys- tems. [Phosphorus makes up
about 1 percent of our raw material expenditure. [The phosphorus
reserves stand at]{.mark} about [90 years at current con-
sumption,]{.mark} but [because phosphate rocks look like
ordinary]{.mark} shales and [limestones, even to experts, we can
anticipate discoveries of new, large deposits in the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recently, [the US Geological Survey
announced the finding of phosphatic crusts and nodules in the offshore
continental shelf of Florida containing very large deposits,
single-handedly doubling the phosphorus reserves to about 180
years]{.underline}. Consequently, [it is not expected that the avail-
ability of phosphorus will become a limitation to food production. 1035
Potassium is the eighth most abundant ele- ment in the Earth\'s crust,
and there is no cause for concern for this important
fertilizer]{.underline}. We spend about 0.1 percent of our raw material
budget on potassium. It is estimated that there are at least 357 years
of consump- tion left at current levels, and [total accessible reserves
indicate sufficient potassium for more than 700 years]{.underline}. 1036
As is evident in Figure 81, [[prices of fertilizer]{.underline} [have
dropped]{.underline}]{.mark} [[about 50 percent]{.mark} in the post-war
period. This is a further indication that [ferti- lizer is
getting]{.mark} not more scarce but rather [more
abundant]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Global topsoil restoration is effective now\-\--solves the impact

of transferred topsoil," Applied Vegetation Science, DOI:

[[As biod]{.mark}iversity [conservation becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}
ever [more [important]{.mark} on a global scale, [restoration is being
used increasingly]{.mark}]{.underline} as a tool [to temper ecological
impacts]{.underline} of development and land-use change (Hobbs et al.
2011; McCarthy et al. 2012), and simply conserving remaining natural
areas is no longer sufficient to meet conservation goals (Grimm et al.
2008; McCarthy et al. 2012). While complete restoration of degraded
ecosystems rarely is a realistic goal (Hobbs 2007), evidence exists that
some taxa, ecological functions and ecosystem services may be returned
(Benayas et al. 2009). Therefore, increasing the knowledge and capacity
to restore larger proportions of taxa in degraded sites is urgently
needed, particularly in biodiversity hotspot regions (Myers et al.
2000).

Ecological restoration is a relatively young science with a rapidly
expanding literature investigating restoration capacity (e.g. Ruthrof et
al. 2013) as well as debating its efficacy and context for biodiversity
conservation (Shackelford et al. 2013). While restoration objectives
vary widely, one of the most common is to return native vegetation to
degraded sites. Methods for returning vegetation most often involve two
distinct approaches; the planting of nursery-raised seedlings, and/or
the direct seeding of native species seed mixes. Both of these methods
require significant inputs of labour and technical knowledge (i.e. seed
collection and storage, germination, propagation, greenhouse use,
planting techniques, etc.). A third method, [[topsoil transfer]{.mark},
the moving of topsoil containing]{.underline} ungerminated but [viable
soil-stored seeds]{.underline} and other propagules -- potentially in
high numbers -- [from newly cleared natural areas to degraded
restoration sites, [offers]{.mark} the potential to return more species
to sites with [shorter lag times and lower labour and technical
inputs]{.mark}]{.underline} (Koch 2007b). [[Topsoil transfer has been
utilized as]{.mark} a [restoration]{.mark} technique [in many regions
globally]{.mark}]{.underline}, including Spain (Tormo et al. 2007),
Japan (Hosogi & Kameyama 2004), Norway (Skrindo & Pedersen 2004), Brazil
(Parrotta & Knowles 2001), France (Vécrin & Muller 2003), South Africa
(van Rooyen et al. 2004) and Australia (Koch 2007a).

[The [use]{.mark} of topsoil transfer as a restoration technique [has
increased in recent years as a tool for]{.mark} post-mining
restoration]{.underline} (Parrotta & Knowles 2001; van Rooyen et al.
2004; Koch 2007b), [roadside restoration]{.underline} (Skrindo &
Pedersen 2004; Tormo et al. 2007), [[restoring degraded
farmland]{.underline}]{.mark} (Vécrin & Muller 2003) [and increasing
biodiversity in urban areas]{.underline} (Hosogi & Kameyama 2004). While
topsoil transfer may offer other benefits (e.g. burying weed seed banks,
providing beneficial soil organisms, etc.) the principal motivation has
been driven by seed banks (Koch 2007b). Topsoil transfer is particularly
appealing in regions characterized by high rates of seed dormancy and
high plant diversity (e.g. Mediterranean and other fire-prone regions)
where technical knowledge (seed characteristics, propagation methods)
may extend to only a small portion of the plant community. Under such
circumstances, [topsoil transfer has the potential to return many
otherwise poorly represented species to restoration sites in an
economical manner]{.underline}.

### AT: Water Shortage

#### Squo solves\-\--global freshwater bioD conservation and [restoration]{.underline} are happening now

Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, 2010, "Freshwater biodiversity
conservation: recent progress and future challenges," Journal of the
North American Benthological Society, Vol. 29, No. 1, p. 344-358

[[Conservationists]{.mark} have [spent much effort to identify]{.mark}
geographic [regions where species richness]{.mark}]{.underline} or
endemism [[is high]{.mark}, and [many]{.mark} such [hotspots are now
well known]{.mark}]{.underline} (Myers et al. 2000, Brooks et al. 2006).
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} information [[is used to prioritize areas
for protection and]{.underline}]{.mark} as input [to]{.underline} formal
algorithms that [[develop optimal networks of protected areas]{.mark}
that protect the most species using the least area]{.underline} (Sarkar
et al. 2006). Freshwater conservation has lagged behind terrestrial
conservation in these subjects, although a recent paper by Abell et al.
(2008) describes [an [ongoing attempt to map global freshwater
hotspots]{.mark}]{.underline}. Global biodiversity assessments
frequently ignore freshwater species (e.g., Myers et al. 2000, Brooks et
al. 2006, Kremen et al. 2008), despite the clear evidence that
freshwater organisms are highly imperiled and that terrestrial hotspots
do not always overlap with freshwater hotspots. Likewise, formal
algorithms for designing optimal networks of protected sites rarely have
been used for freshwater species (but see Linke et al. 2007, 2008).

Restoration ecology

The [[rising interest in protecting]{.underline}]{.mark} or managing
[natural [ecosystems has been paralleled by]{.mark} a [rapid rise
in]{.mark} interest in [using]{.mark} scientific [knowledge to
restore]{.mark} or rehabilitate [damaged
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the appearance of
professional societies (Society for Ecological Restoration), journals
(Restoration Ecology), and textbooks (Perrow and Davy 2002, Cooke et al.
2005, Falk et al. 2006). [Interest in [restoration]{.mark}]{.underline}
or rehabilitation [[of freshwater ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[has accelerated]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., Hart and Poff 2002 \[Fig.
2\], Buijse et al. 2005, National Research Council 2008). Restoration or
[[rehabilitation of lakes]{.underline}]{.mark} rests on a firm
scientific foundation (Cooke et al. 2005) and [[are routinely]{.mark}
and [successfully practiced]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scientific restoration
and rehabilitation of running waters and wetlands is less well
developed. [[Stream and wetland restoration are widely
practiced]{.underline}]{.mark}, but many projects fail to achieve their
objectives or are never adequately evaluated (Bernhardt et al. 2005
\[Fig. 2\], Palmer et al. 2007).

Attack of the Killer Robots

Nanotechnology scientists dream of some day creating robots the size of
molecules, or even turning molecules into machines that could roam the
human body and perform all sorts of useful tasks. But some
nanotechnology theorists and science fiction aficionados imagine a more
ominous possibility[. [What if]{.mark} one of these [tiny robots]{.mark}
were given the ability to [self-replicate?]{.mark} All it would take is
a single malfunction and the robots would consume everything in the
galaxy as they multiply out of control until all that was left was a
shapeless, robotic mass called "grey goo."]{.underline}

Worst Case Scenario

Now, before you go heading for the hills with a year's supply of water
and a survival guide, understand that the death-by-robot scenario is
just that---a scenario, and a pretty fanciful one to boot. [First,
[we're nowhere near the point of being able to create a self-replicating
nano-machine.]{.mark} But [even if such]{.mark} machines do one day
[exist, they would have a hard time taking over the universe for]{.mark}
one simple reason: **[fuel]{.mark}**. Even microscopic [machines need an
energy source. Inorganic matte]{.mark}r such as rocks and minerals
[wouldn't do the trick because they just **don't contain stuff that the
machines could break down and use for power.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[But [what if]{.mark} a mad scientist created a [robot]{.mark} that [fed
on organic materials such as sunlight and living things? **Not to
worry**. Natural life forms have]{.mark} had around four [billion years
of training to compete for resources]{.mark}; the [killer robots]{.mark}
probably **[wouldn't stand]{.mark} much of [a chance]{.mark}** [against
such streamlined competitors. Plus, if the robots were made from organic
materials, they might be **preyed on by bacteria or other
predators.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
